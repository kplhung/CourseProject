        <p>There is a new smartness in the step of Britain's Conservative leader, William Hague, putting him in closer reach of the front-running Prime Minister Tony Blair and in distant sight of the previously unimaginable destination of 10 Downing Street.</p>
        <p>With the likely date of the next national election less than a year off, Mr. Hague is dominating the headlines for the first time in the three years since he took over the depleted Tory party, once Europe's mightiest election machine. Though he has not shaken the belief that Labor will win, he has thrown the government on the defensive. A series of mistakes by the Blair administration has given Mr. Hague an opportunity to score points in city government, health care, law and order, immigration and pensions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair's attempts to defend his record by calling Mr. Hague an opportunist are proving unconvincing. With Labor in its fourth year of power, the public now assigns it responsibility for social service shortfalls.</p>
        <p>Although Labor politicians believe that the party's re-election chances are secure, they are unsettled at seeing the Conservatives setting the political agenda. Within the Conservative Party, Mr. Hague's performance has stilled talk of his removal after the election and his replacement by Michael Portillo, the former defense secretary who had been the favorite of many Tories longing for a bruiser at the head of the party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hague has shored up his standing by combining his hard-line stance against Britain's adopting the euro as its currency with a new focus on combating an enemy he identifies as a ''liberal elite.'' This element, he says, coddles ''bogus'' asylum seekers, allows a ''flood'' of illegal immigrants into the country and is soft on crime, school discipline and sex education for youth and not supportive enough of families.</p>
        <p>Deftly turning the tables on Labor, he criticized government efforts to hold the line on pension increases as ''miserly'' and said pensioners were the ''unwanted, unwelcome and uncool guests at New Labor's banquet.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Hague rises in people's estimations, however, even his friends and supporters express concern that the steps he has taken to turn himself into a more forceful Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition -- pushing hot-button populist issues in a way that can leave him looking more like a rabble-rouser than a statesman -- might make him a less credible candidate for prime minister. Building a protest movement is one thing, the reasoning goes; leading a government is another.</p>
        <p>''It's true that people say those things although obviously they're wrong,'' he said in an on-the-run interview while campaigning last Thursday in a by-election contest in Tottenham in North London. ''Actually it's been an advantage over the past three years to be consistently underestimated.</p>
        <p>''You know, I said to the party after the last election that we would go through several stages in the recovery of our party. First of all, people would say, 'There's no way you Tories can recover. You lost so heavily, you're finished forever. There's no way you can ever get back.' Then they would say, 'O.K., you're recovering but you know you won't be able to recover quickly enough.' Then they'll say, 'O.K. so you're recovering more quickly than you expected, but you know you won't be able to keep it up.' And then I said, we'll go onto the next stage which is when they will say, 'We always knew the Tories were going to recover and be back in.'</p>
        <p>''So,'' he concluded, ''we're not far off now from that fourth point, and we're still very happy to continue to be underestimated.''</p>
        <p>With Mr. Hague in the ascendancy, the weekly Prime Minister's Question Time exchange of barked insults between Mr. Blair and him has become blood sport. Mr. Hague opened last week's verbal punch-up by quoting embarrassing criticisms of Mr. Blair in a leaked memo by the prime minister's own public attitude sounder.</p>
        <p>''Once again T. B. is pandering, lacking conviction, unable to hold to a position for more than a few weeks and lacking the guts to be able to tough it out,'' was one quote that Mr. Hague gleefully read out to the Commons as Tory backbenchers lustily cheered him on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair wagged his finger at Mr. Hague and warned that he could retaliate with some focus-group comments about him, and when the Conservative leader kept on, the prime minister made good on his pledge to whoops of delight from the Labor side of the chamber.</p>
        <p>''This is what they say,'' he bellowed. ''Boring, false, he irritates me greatly, pathetic drip, nonentity, no substance, no personality, complete waste of time, no policies, a very unimpressive team, particularly William Hague.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hague's arrival as a credible Conservative leader follows a sequence of failed ''relaunches,'' fresh starts and new initiatives. Though at 39, he is eight years Mr. Blair's junior, he is prematurely bald, crisp in his Oxford Union debating style and comes on as something of a young fogey to many Britons, who know of his reputation for having read parliamentary reports, memorized speeches by Winston Churchill and learned the names and districts of all Tory members of Parliament, all when he was just 15.</p>
        <p>He famously burst upon the scene a year later when, as a mop-haired student, he took the podium at the annual Conservative Party conference and fired up the faithful with a call to arms in defense of Tory principles. Photographs from the time show Margaret Thatcher looking on enraptured.</p>
        <p>In pursuit of an updated image once he was the leader, he put on jeans and a baseball cap, slid down amusement park water sluices, went to ethnic culture festivals, took outdoor adventure vacations with his new wife, Ffion, traveled the country in a studiously informal ''Listening to Britain'' campaign, and began to call his philosophy ''kitchen sink Conservatism'' before abandoning it this year for the slogan ''The Common Sense Revolution.''</p>
        <p>He even cleared his office walls of pictures of his one-time heroine Mrs. Thatcher to stop colleagues from mooning over the party's triumphal past and make them focus on the possibilities of a future under him. Only now does it seem certain there will be one.</p>
