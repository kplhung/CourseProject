        <p>The AT&amp;T Corporation agreed yesterday to pay $3.3 billion in cash for wireless telephone systems in Houston, San Diego and San Francisco to expand its fast-growing wireless telecommunications business.</p>
        <p>As a result of the transactions, the AT&amp;T Wireless Group, the company's mobile-phone arm, will add 1.3 million customers and 1,400 employees. AT&amp;T will acquire operations in San Francisco from Vodafone AirTouch P.L.C., in San Diego from the GTE Corporation and in Houston from PrimeCo PCS, once a venture of Bell Atlantic and Vodafone.</p>
        <p>Part of the impetus behind the deal came from regulatory requirements that Vodafone AirTouch, GTE and the Bell Atlantic Corporation shed overlapping wireless properties as they create Verizon Wireless. Bell Atlantic and GTE agreed to merge in 1998; last year Bell Atlantic and Vodafone agreed to combine their wireless operations in the United States.</p>
        <p>Investors were not overly enthusiastic about the deal and only slightly bid up shares in both AT&amp;T and its wireless unit.</p>
        <p>Shares in AT&amp;T have been battered during the last three months, sliding 36 percent as concern persists over declining revenue from long-distance services. And shares of AT&amp;T Wireless have not done much better, remaining below their initial offering price of $29.50 in April.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T rose 5.62 cents, to $34, and AT&amp;T Wireless added 3.75 cents, to $34.25.</p>
        <p>While AT&amp;T is also expected to trim the roaming fees it must pay to other phone carriers with this expansion into the three remaining large American cities in which it could not offer AT&amp;T-branded wireless services, it is not clear how much the move will affect long-term investor sentiment.</p>
        <p>''Strategically, it's important for AT&amp;T to have nationwide coverage but it's nothing groundbreaking,'' said Kenneth Schapiro, president of Condor Capital in Martinsville, N.J., a $480 million money management company that owns some AT&amp;T shares. ''It's funny how a $3.3 billion deal doesn't mean much these days.''</p>
        <p>Within the fast-consolidating United States wireless industry, AT&amp;T is trying to grow to compete with Verizon, which would be the country's largest wireless company with 23 million customers, and with SBC Communications and BellSouth, which are forming the second-largest wireless carrier with about 16.2 million customers. When AT&amp;T completes the acquisitions in San Francisco, San Diego and Houston, it is expected to have nearly 15 million customers.</p>
        <p>''We're using our I.P.O. capital as a currency to extend our footprint,'' John Zeglis, chairman of AT&amp;T Wireless, said in a telephone interview. AT&amp;T Wireless raised a record $10.6 billion in its April public offering.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the deal is expected to cut into profits at AT&amp;T itself, which owns more than 80 percent of its wireless unit, by an estimated 2 to 3 cents a share this year, according to AT&amp;T. As an additional part of the deal, AT&amp;T expects to spend about $275 million over two years to adapt systems in Houston and San Diego to its national standards.</p>
        <p>With the deals, AT&amp;T will enlarge its capacity to sell its wireless services in the nation's two largest states, to about 90 percent of Californians and 70 percent of Texans.</p>
        <p>Still, ''the company has a lot more work to do to stop leakage of roaming costs,'' said Bruce Roberts, a telecommunications analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. ''Wireless is a jewel for AT&amp;T but I still see dust gathering on that jewel.''</p>
