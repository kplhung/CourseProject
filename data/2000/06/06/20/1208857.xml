        <p>Battered by the low gold prices of the last year and squeezed by a currency crisis at home, Zimbabwe's gold mines are struggling to function.</p>
        <p>Gold, the country's biggest export after tobacco, is a crucial source of foreign currency, and the collapse of the industry would be a severe blow  to an economy that is already in deep trouble.</p>
        <p>Many mines in Zimbabwe are running perilously low on imported supplies like cyanide, which is used to dissolve gold from crushed rock. Some mines say that they could be forced to shut down in a matter of weeks or months.</p>
        <p>''If the situation continues, we will become totally uneconomical, and we will have to close,'' said Frank Purcell, managing director of Delta Gold Zimbabwe, one of the country's largest gold producers. ''It's not going to take long.''</p>
        <p>Another of the big producers, Rio Tinto Zimbabwe, acknowledged the troubles of the last several months but said none of its mines were yet on the brink. ''Given the price of gold, and the current exchange rate, we are finding it difficult, but we have no planned closures,'' said Frank Webster, the company's director of personnel and public relations.</p>
        <p>Hoping to exert some pressure on the government of President Robert Mugabe, the Chamber of Mines in Zimbabwe issued a stark warning this month about the state of the industry and urged action to avert the closing of the country's mines.</p>
        <p>But with parliamentary elections just days away, and the president's party facing a credible challenge for the first time in the country's history, the ruling party, which dominates government, is focusing attention on its own survival.</p>
        <p>Exactly what the Ministry of Mines and the Reserve Bank could do to avert a shutdown in the industry is not clear.</p>
        <p>For months, the government has been short of money. Inflation has been as high as 70 percent, foreign currency reserves have plunged and the Zimbabwe dollar has remained artificially tied to the United States dollar, far above its true value.</p>
        <p>The gold mines must sell their production to the Reserve Bank at prices calculated according to the official exchange rate of about $38 Zimbabwe dollars to $1. The cap on the currency has driven up the cost of materials, which must be bought at far higher rates that reflect a more realistic value for the Zimbabwe dollar.</p>
        <p>Talk of freeing the Zimbabwe dollar to let market forces determine its value has been going on for weeks, and such a move would almost certainly lead to a sharp devaluation. So far nothing has happened.</p>
        <p>A devaluation would help cut the cost of Zimbabwe's exports and could help stimulate the economy. But Hester Le Roux, who is a director of Gold Fields Minerals Services, a precious metals research firm in London, says that even if there is a devaluation, it will ''merely be a first step, and that other steps will need to be taken.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Purcell of Delta Gold said he did not believe a devaluation was necessarily the answer.</p>
        <p>If the president is to be believed, however, far more sweeping changes could be in store for the mining industry in Zimbabwe. In an interview published last week, Mr. Mugabe told a British newspaper that his government would soon turn its attention to the mines as part of its campaign to redistribute the country's resources to the black majority.</p>
        <p>Considering how the country's efforts at agricultural land reform floundered before erupting in pre-election political violence this year, his words were of little comfort to  the mining industry.</p>
        <p>For now, the mining houses are just watching the situation, hoping the election on Saturday and Sunday, whatever the outcome, opens the door to a turnaround.</p>
        <p>Already, however, the gold miners, like the tobacco farmers, say that damage has been done and that undoing it will take months if not years. In particular, most mining houses have over the last couple of months scaled back or even halted their exploration and development efforts, averting layoffs but imperiling the mines' future production.</p>
        <p>Zimbabwe produced almost 30 million ounces of gold last year, just over 1 percent of the world total and a fraction of the nearly 450 million ounces produced by neighboring South Africa, the world's biggest producer of gold. Indeed the loss of the Zimbabwe production, ranked 16th worldwide, would hardly register on international gold markets.</p>
        <p>But for a poor country like Zimbabwe, which relies heavily on agriculture and mining, the effects would reverberate among the 12 million people, many of them unemployed.</p>
