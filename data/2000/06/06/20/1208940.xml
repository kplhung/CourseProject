        <p>Canada's largest bank, Royal Bank of Canada, has agreed to buy the Liberty Life Insurance Company and the Liberty Insurance Services Corporation, two subsidiaries of the Liberty Corporation of Greenville, S.C., for $650 million. The two insurance companies have 1,500 employees and agents, and manage $2 billion of assets. John Cleghorn, chairman and chief executive of Royal Bank, said the purchase provided ''excellent opportunities for cross-selling with our retail operations in the United States,'' which include banking and investor services. Although Royal Bank's insurance subsidiary has been growing steadily in Canada, domestic banking regulations do not permit insurance to be sold through bank branches. The Liberty Corporation said it agreed to buy Civic Communications, a television broadcaster based in Jackson, Miss., for $204 million.</p>
