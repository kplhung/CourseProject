        <p>Diplomats at Work At Metropolitan</p>
        <p>A private, ambassadors-only viewing of ''Art and Oracle: Spirit Voices of Africa'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was right on schedule yesterday morning when an aide handed AMBASSADOR RICHARD C.

        <p>Diplomats at Work At Metropolitan</p>
        <p>A private, ambassadors-only viewing of ''Art and Oracle: Spirit Voices of Africa'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was right on schedule yesterday morning when an aide handed AMBASSADOR RICHARD C. HOLBROOKE, the United States representative to the United Nations, his cellular telephone.</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry, it's the one phone call I have to take,'' he said. And so the speeches welcoming the diplomats to the Met were put on hold while he talked with NELSON MANDELA, the former South African president.</p>
        <p>The call lasted a minute or two. Then PHILIPPE DE MONTEBELLO, the director of the Met, addressed the ambassadors in English and French before introducing Mr. Holbrooke.</p>
        <p>''Merci, cher Philippe,'' Mr. Holbrooke said, before switching to English. He noted that the ambassadors were all from African countries, except for AMBASSADOR ANTONIO MONTEIRO of Portugal, who was born in Angola. ''Antonio called me up and said, 'I'm African, too,' '' Mr. Holbrooke said. ''I said, fine.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke also saluted the curator of ''Art and Oracle,'' ALISA LaGAMMA, whose was born in Congo and whose father, ROBERT, retired as a foreign service officer. ''This is a generational advance,'' Mr. Holbrooke said. ''From diplomat to curator is clearly a step up.''</p>
        <p>At Breakfast, Hanover Presides</p>
        <p>DONNA HANOVER presided over a breakfast at Gracie Mansion yesterday for Race for the Cure, the five-kilometer run in Central Park that benefits breast cancer research. It was Ms. Hanover's first public appearance at Gracie Mansion since her husband, MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI, announced that he would seek a separation from her.</p>
        <p>The couple continue to live at Gracie Mansion with their two children, although Ms. Hanover recently hired a divorce lawyer. JOANNIE DANIELIDES, Ms. Hanover's press secretary, would not address questions about Ms. Hanover's plans.</p>
        <p>''Donna is living at Gracie Mansion with her family,'' Ms. Danielides said. ''She's continuing to work with the service organizations she's worked with over the years.''</p>
        <p>Race for the Cure is the main fund-raiser for the New York City affiliate of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, after coffee on the Gracie Mansion porch, officials of the foundation gave out $500,000 in grants to community health groups and hospitals.</p>
        <p>The group also received a donation -- from PETER KLEIN, 13, of Demarest, N.J., who went to the podium to announce that he was donating $1,000 of his bar mitzvah money in honor of his mother, PHYLLIS KLEIN, who has been fighting breast cancer for the last four years.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't my suggestion,'' said his mother, dabbing away tears. ''It was just something he wanted to do.''</p>
        <p>On-Air Star Takes In-Air Ride</p>
        <p>Apparently, DON IMUS had a date with Destiny on Sunday, and it did not go well.</p>
        <p>Destiny is a horse on Mr. Imus's ranch near Santa Fe, N.M. The Associated Press quoted CHARLES McCORD, the newscaster on Mr. Imus's early-morning radio show, as saying that Mr. Imus had been thrown from Destiny and suffered five broken ribs, a broken collar bone and a shoulder separation. And Mr. Imus's left lung collapsed, the A.P. said.</p>
        <p>The A.P. added that Mr. Imus was being treated in Albuquerque. Mr. McCord was quoted as saying that Mr. Imus was ''in stable condition, alert and resting comfortably.''</p>
        <p>''He's going to be out of commission for a little while,'' Mr. McCord said. It was not clear when Mr. Imus would return to his show; he had been scheduled to be on vacation this week and next.</p>
        <p>''It just continues with this knucklehead, the poor guy,'' Mr. McCord said on the air.</p>
        <p>Judge Not Satisfied</p>
        <p>The judge in the MICK JAGGER child-support case wants to see a financial statement. And he also wants more testimony from Mr. Jagger by telephone, which would spare Mr. Jagger from having to travel to New York.</p>
        <p>The judge, DAVID KIRSHBLUM, a Family Court hearing examiner, said he wanted Mr. Jagger to testify about what he pays for his other children. The case before Judge Kirshblum was brought by LUCIANA MORAD, the 29-year-old lingerie model who gave birth to LUCAS MAURICE MORAD JAGGER last year. Mr. Jagger denied paternity until a blood test showed that he was the boy's father. Mr. Jagger's lawyer, JOHN VASSALLO, said he would appeal the order about the financial statement.</p>
        <p>Upwardly Mobile</p>
        <p>This has been a busy month for JAMES MURDOCH, the youngest of RUPERT MURDOCH'S four children. First the family's News Corporation named him to be chief executive and chairman of its Star TV satellite television service. On Saturday, he married KATHRYN HUFSCHMID, a public relations executive, at the Grassy Hill Congregational Church in Lyme, Conn. Guests said the couple would move to Hong Kong, where Star TV has its headquarters.</p>
