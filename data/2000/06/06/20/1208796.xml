        <p>There is both a place and a need for children's works in the classical music repertory, but few composers have turned their hand to the task  and of those that have, few have done it successfully. Success, of course, is in the ear of the beholder, but one criterion is that the work can sit comfortably beside the concert works in the composer's catalog, as Prokofiev's ''Peter and the Wolf,'' Saint-Saens's ''Carnival of the Animals,'' Britten's ''Young People's Guide to the Orchestra'' and Poulenc's ''Histoire de Babar'' do.</p>
        <p>It must also accomplish several seemingly irreconcilable tasks. It must be sufficiently entertaining to engage young minds that are likely to wander if the piece evolves too slowly. It must offer a lesson of some sort, even if it's only a sense of what orchestral instruments sound like and what kinds of imagery they can evoke, but at the same time it must avoid seeming didactic. Probably the biggest challenge, though, is in writing a work that adults can listen to without squirming.</p>

        <p>There is both a place and a need for children's works in the classical music repertory, but few composers have turned their hand to the task  and of those that have, few have done it successfully. Success, of course, is in the ear of the beholder, but one criterion is that the work can sit comfortably beside the concert works in the composer's catalog, as Prokofiev's ''Peter and the Wolf,'' Saint-Saens's ''Carnival of the Animals,'' Britten's ''Young People's Guide to the Orchestra'' and Poulenc's ''Histoire de Babar'' do.</p>
        <p>It must also accomplish several seemingly irreconcilable tasks. It must be sufficiently entertaining to engage young minds that are likely to wander if the piece evolves too slowly. It must offer a lesson of some sort, even if it's only a sense of what orchestral instruments sound like and what kinds of imagery they can evoke, but at the same time it must avoid seeming didactic. Probably the biggest challenge, though, is in writing a work that adults can listen to without squirming.</p>
        <p>Raphael Mostel's ''Travels of Babar,'' based on the second Jean de Brunhoff's Babar book, meets these disparate demands nicely. Judging from children's reactions on Sunday afternoon at Florence Gould Hall, where the work had its New York premiere run, Babar remains a children's favorite, and Mr. Mostel capitalized on that by making sure that the story was seen as well as heard. Pictures from the book were projected on a screen behind the musicians.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mostel's music is direct, picturesque and rather sweet: when Babar and his bride, Celeste, fly off on their honeymoon in a balloon, a gently rising figure for viola, cello, piano and lightly rippling percussion lifts them on their way.</p>
        <p>In the hour that follows, their adventures -- narrated here by Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson, in an English translation by Phyllis Rose -- are accompanied by elephant trumpeting, car horns (in the travel music), quickly passing dissonances (in the battle with the rhinoceroses) and bird calls (in the evocation of the elephant kingdom). The characters are not given instrumental equivalents, but each of the instruments in the octet that accompanies the reading has opportunities to show off and to push the edges of their techniques.</p>
        <p>There are also references in the score for adults, including a fragment of a Bach Cello Prelude, some Stravinskian cornet music in a circus scene and a touch of slightly controlled chaos in the spirit of John Cage. Perhaps most crucially, the music has a narrative and lyrical flow that makes its charms hard to resist.</p>
        <p>''The Travels of Babar'' does sit oddly beside the works for which Mr. Mostel is known. Principally, he has been an explorer in timbre, texture and acoustics, and has created a repertory of entrancing works using ancient instruments, principally shofars and Tibetan singing bowls. Still, this work, which has occupied Mr. Mostel for the last nine years, seems an expansion into another musical realm rather than an abberation.</p>
        <p>The fine musicians in the octet were David Hattner, clarinetist; Martin Kuuskman, bassoonist; Tom Hoyt, cornetist; Michael Hosford, trombonist; Joseph Kubera, pianist; Eduardo Leandro, percussionist; Aurora Manuel, violist; and Dorothy Lawson, cellist. Paul Hostetter conducted.</p>
