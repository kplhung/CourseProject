        <p>In the space of a few days last week, in speeches and television advertisements, Hillary Rodham Clinton assailed Representative Rick A. Lazio as a friend to the gun lobby, a foe of abortion rights, and hostile to women, children and families, by virtue of some of the votes he has cast in Congress. But there was one thing notably missing from the first lady's broad and calculated barrage on her new opponent in the race for the United States Senate: any mention of Newt Gingrich.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, was pushed to front and center by the Clinton camp when Mr. Lazio entered the race a month ago, as Mrs. Clinton's senior advisers rushed to describe Mr. Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican, as a ''foot soldier in the Gingrich revolution.'' But Mr. Gingrich has now faded almost as quickly as he appeared.</p>
        <p>That references to Mr. Gingrich have so suddenly vanished from the Clinton campaign lexicon suggests an initial miscalculation by Mrs. Clinton and her advisers. Mr. Gingrich, it seems, is not the notorious figure he was two years ago, even in New York, a realization Mrs. Clinton's aides said they reached quickly.</p>
        <p>But, perhaps more significantly, it suggests the complications Mrs. Clinton faces in running against an opponent who, while not as moderate as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, is not quite the conservative Mrs. Clinton would like to face in this Democratic  state. Even Mrs. Clinton's advisers now acknowledge that Mr. Lazio is no Newt Gingrich.</p>
        <p>When those advisers first sought to discredit Mr. Lazio by noting his support for Mr. Gingrich's policies during his reign, the strategy struck some Democrats and Republicans as curious. Mr. Gingrich had been the Democrats' favorite Republican in the years after he was identified with the shutdown of the federal government in 1995.</p>
        <p>But in the 2000 round of Congressional campaigns, with Mr. Gingrich now back in private life, Democrats have largely concluded that that line of attack does not have the potency it once had, which is evident by the fact that his name has barely come up in any House or Senate campaigns this year. And Mr. Gingrich's successor -- that would be J. Dennis Hastert, of course -- is neither as infamous nor as polarizing as Mr. Gingrich once was, several Democrats acknowledged wistfully.</p>
        <p>''It is fading,'' Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said of Mr. Gingrich's role in the national campaign. ''It serves as an important reference, but it's certainly fading.''</p>
        <p>In the scramble to adjust after Mr. Giuliani quit the New York race, the initial belief in Mrs. Clinton's camp was that the old Gingrich script would work again, and that Mr. Gingrich remained an effective target in a state that he often invoked as an example of Democratic policies gone awry.</p>
        <p>One of Mrs. Clinton's senior advisers, Harold P. Ickes, attacked Mr. Lazio in The New York Post for ''doing the work of Newt Gingrich'' -- a full day before Mr. Lazio had even announced his candidacy.</p>
        <p>It was, in many ways, the mirror image of the Republicans' strategy in the 1998 Senate race in New York, when, reprising an old chestnut of a campaign tactic, they attacked Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat, as ''too liberal'' for New York. Mr. Schumer, of course, went on to defeat Alfonse M. D'Amato, the three-term Republican senator.</p>
        <p>''When in doubt, go back to the old playbook,'' Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant, said of Mrs. Clinton's invocation of Mr. Gingrich. ''The problem is that the old playbook is not working. Gingrich is old news. He's gone. He's off the scene.''</p>
        <p>Without question, Mr. Gingrich is an unpopular figure in New York.  One out of two New Yorkers have an unfavorable opinion of him, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll taken June 4 to June 10.</p>
        <p>But 36 percent were undecided or  had no opinion at all, suggesting that even Mr. Gingrich might be riding off into the political sunset. And Charles Cook, the editor of a Washington-based political newsletter that tracks Congressional races, said that while Mr. Gingrich was a ''metaphor for the excesses of '95 and '96, that was four or five years ago. Republicans have been behaving on most issues fairly carefully since then.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's advisers said they noted that their attempts to link Mr. Lazio to Mr. Gingrich had led to eye rolling in the media as they tried to make the case to reporters the weekend Mr. Lazio entered the race. That anecdotal observation was subsequently confirmed in a poll by Mrs. Clinton's pollster, Mark Penn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's senior campaign strategist, Mike Murphy, said he noted the change in strategy, though he was not surprised by it. ''It backfired,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''And like so much of the Hillary Clinton campaign, it could not pass the laugh test.''</p>
        <p>Without the convenience of a Mr. Gingrich, Mrs. Clinton has been forced to pick and choose votes Mr. Lazio has cast over the last seven years to emphasize the conservative edge of his ideological spectrum.</p>
        <p>For example, Mrs. Clinton noted that Mr. Lazio had opposed a Democratic bill to protect consumers in dealing with health maintenance organizations, had opposed a so-called hate crimes bill, and had voted against a bill to provide federal financing for 100,000 new teachers.  ''By the time this race is over, there isn't going to be anyone who doesn't know that Rick Lazio voted against the 100,000 teachers,'' Mr. Torricelli said.</p>
        <p>But it has not been easy. When Mrs. Clinton attacked Mr. Lazio for opposing the registration of new guns and the licensing of gun owners, Mr. Lazio countered by noting that he supports a ban on assault weapons and voted for the Brady Bill, which imposes a waiting period on handgun purchases.</p>
        <p>And when Mrs. Clinton sought to  present Mr. Lazio as an opponent of  abortion rights by noting his opposition to public financing for abortions and support for a ban on the procedure that foes describe as partial-birth abortion, Mr. Lazio responded by noting his record of opposing efforts to criminalize abortion.</p>
        <p>Given all that, is it any wonder that Democrats in New York these days are speaking nostalgically about Mr. Gingrich as they contemplate the race Mrs. Clinton now faces? ''Gingrich was beautiful,'' said Mr. Sheinkopf, the Democratic consultant.  ''He was larger than life. He was extraordinarily vocal. He was a perfect foil for Democrats.''</p>
        <p>''Big loss for Democrats,'' he said.</p>
