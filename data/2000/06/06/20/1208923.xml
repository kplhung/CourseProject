        <p>President Ernesto Zedillo today assailed opposition candidates who have warned of possible irregularities in the July 2 election for president.</p>
        <p>Using sharp words for a normally mild-spoken chief executive, Mr. Zedillo accused the opposition candidates of ''sowing mistrust'' in the federal agency that is overseeing the vote.</p>
        <p>In a speech to business executives here, he said the candidates were also trying to discredit the election with ''intransigent positions.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Zedillo did not mention them by name, his comments seemed directed at Vicente Fox Quesada, a right-of-center candidate who is challenging the governing party, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, a left-leaning contender. The two candidates have been battling each other furiously from the campaign trail, but last week they joined in a pact to guard against voter coercion before the election and against fraud during the balloting.</p>
        <p>In a speech last week Mr. Cardenas proposed to all the candidates that if the election is not clean, no one should declare victory. Mr. Fox has predicted that if the governing party candidate, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, does not win by at least 10 points, many Mexicans will not believe that he won fairly.</p>
        <p>President Zedillo said today,  ''Those who proclaim election results before the citizens have voted, and insinuate that they will not recognize the outcome if they do not win, show no democratic convictions or respect for democracy.''</p>
        <p>His salvo echoed a speech Mr. Labastida made on Sunday in Mexico City before tens of thousands of followers of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI. The candidate said this year's elections would be ''the cleanest and most competitive in our history.''</p>
        <p>To shouts of joy, Mr. Labastida said, ''Only those who already feel defeated would cry fraud ahead of time.''</p>
        <p>No one disputes that this election is far more open and fair than any other Mexico has had. The Federal Electoral Institute, which for the first time is largely independent from the government, has spent $918 million to level the playing field for the candidates and build a foolproof system for tallying the ballots.</p>
        <p>But the PRI, which has held presidential power for seven decades, remains intertwined with the government and has a tradition of using handouts or threats to sway the vote. Both Mexican and international election observers have reported numerous incidents that indicate that the PRI is making widespread use of machine tactics.</p>
        <p>''Instead of making this kind of comments, President Zedillo should demonstrate his own democratic good will by taking his hands off the electoral process and stopping the vote-buying by the federal government,'' Martha Sahagun, Mr. Fox's spokeswoman, responded today.</p>
        <p>After months of being on the sidelines, Mr. Zedillo has become more active in promoting Mr. Labastida and the PRI. According to the newspaper Reforma, since April 1 Mr. Zedillo has been exceptionally busy inaugurating public work projects around the country, worth a total of $435 million.</p>
        <p>The president also ignored a call from the federal elections agency to cancel advertising of government programs in the final weeks before the election. Every day, the Mexico City newspapers are filled with full-page ads touting the successes of federal programs. Leading television and radio news shows are punctuated with spots carrying the same message.</p>
