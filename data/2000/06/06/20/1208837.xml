        <p>The Cendant Corporation contended in a court filing yesterday that the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young knew of widespread fraud at CUC International, a predecessor to Cendant, by 1997 and chose to help the fraud along rather than expose it. Ernst &amp; Young immediately responded by attributing the fraud in part to Cendant's current chief executive, Henry R. Silverman.</p>

        <p>The Cendant Corporation contended in a court filing yesterday that the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young knew of widespread fraud at CUC International, a predecessor to Cendant, by 1997 and chose to help the fraud along rather than expose it. Ernst &amp; Young immediately responded by attributing the fraud in part to Cendant's current chief executive, Henry R. Silverman.</p>
        <p>Three former CUC officials pleaded guilty to fraud charges last week, with one saying the fraudulent accounting practices began as early as 1983. The Securities and Exchange Commission, in bringing a civil action against Cendant, concluded that the fraud had begun by the late 1980's and might have started much sooner.</p>
        <p>In an amended complaint filed yesterday in United States District Court in Newark, Cendant contended that ''by 1997 at the latest, E.&amp; Y. knew that the financial statements of CUC did not fairly reflect its financial position and knew that CUC senior management was fabricating the supposed support for its financial statements.''</p>
        <p>The amended complaint contends that the auditing firm concealed the fraud ''first by negligence, then by conscious avoidance and eventually by active facilitation.''</p>
        <p>The fraud was exposed in April 1998, a few months after CUC merged with HFS Inc. to form Cendant. Cendant's current management, largely the former management of HFS, says that it relied on Ernst &amp; Young for assurances in completing the merger after it was denied access to information by CUC officials, ostensibly out of concerns that HFS might become a competitor if the merger collapsed.</p>
        <p>Ernst &amp; Young has previously sued Cendant and its executives, contending that by March 1998, when the accounting firm signed off on the 1997 annual report, the former HFS officials had discovered that CUC was manipulating merger reserves ''to manufacture phony earnings'' but did not tell the auditing firm.</p>
        <p>''We are suing Henry Silverman and others responsible at Cendant because they knew there was fraud and did not inform their auditors or anyone else,'' said Larry Parnall, a spokesman for the accounting firm. ''They made the conscious decision to keep that from the public. We are ready, willing and able to litigate this case in the courts.''</p>
        <p>Those merger reserves also figure prominently in the new Cendant complaint against the auditing firm, which contends that it was Ernst &amp; Young that had information that the merger reserves were phony but nonetheless certified the numbers.</p>
        <p>The Cendant complaint contends that Kenneth Wilchfort, a partner in Ernst &amp; Young, wrote the documents the company used to explain an inflated merger reserve created for the deal that formed Cendant and then inserted them in the file as company documents. Similarly, in manipulating a reserve related to another merger, the complaint says that Simon Wood, a manager for the auditing firm, wrote a memorandum for CUC officials to sign that justified fraudulent numbers.</p>
        <p>Despite the contention that Ernst &amp; Young officials knew of the fraud, the new Cendant complaint says that CUC officials ''were careful not to place E.&amp; Y. in the awkward position of knowing too much or lacking documentation for its audits.</p>
        <p>''They recognized,'' the compalaint continues, ''that although E.&amp; Y. would facilitate the fraud, it would insist at all times on 'deniability.' ''</p>
        <p>Cendant shares traded for more than $40 each in early April 1998, soon before the fraud was disclosed, but fell to a low of $6.50 in the fall of that year. Yesterday, they rose 31.25 cents, to $13.375.</p>
