        <p>THE hideous sexual assaults in Central Park have been chewed over pretty thoroughly by now, but one aspect deserves a bit more attention. This is the reaction of leading black and Hispanic figures, who have stepped forward over the last week to denounce the park thugs and to demand that they be turned over to the police.</p>
        <p>Why, you may wonder, is that such a big deal? Because there have been times when virtually the opposite took place, when racial wagons were drawn tightly in a circle after the arrests of many black or Hispanic men in a notorious criminal case.</p>
        <p>Senator David A. Paterson of Harlem recalls being ''treated like a pariah'' in 1989 for breaking ethnic ranks over the Central Park jogger, the white woman who was viciously beaten and left for dead by a band of young black men. In some black neighborhoods, there was virtually a blame-the-victim air, Mr. Paterson said. As for black officials, too many had a ''slurred, slow response'' to a horrible attack.</p>
        <p>''There almost was this institutionalization of excuses,'' the senator said. '' 'It's not them, the suspects, it's the conditions they live in that are to blame.' But in the end, there has to be some responsibility taken.''</p>
        <p>''In the last decade,'' he continued, ''there's been a growth in the idea that you have to be willing to look in your own backyard, whether it involves extremists who use bigoted language or criminals. There's been more willingness to expose the problem and not just hush it up.''</p>
        <p>Accept the senator's analysis or not, and not everyone does, it is striking how many prominent blacks and Hispanics have gone before the microphones to declare that outrages like the park assaults must stop. One could quibble over whether some stood up fast enough. But by the same token, one could fault the mayor and the police commissioner for being slow to realize what a mess they were in.</p>
        <p>The point is that stomach-churning behavior has been denounced, forcefully and without regard to color or ethnicity. ''A thug is a thug is a thug,'' said Dennis Walcott, president of the New York Urban League.</p>
        <p>Nor is the Central Park violence an isolated situation.</p>
        <p>The recent string of livery-cab killings and the Wendy's massacre last month also produced expressions of disgust and calls for people to hand over the criminals to the police. Among those making such appeals were the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, black leaders who usually direct their fire at the police, for misdeeds both real and imagined.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walcott, for one, is not convinced that the change is all that profound.</p>
        <p>News organizations, he said, tend to be drawn to personalities who know their way around a sound bite. (Hard to argue with that.) When these camera-ready figures change their tune for a day or two, the reaction can be outsized. But people like him, interested more in programs than posturing, have always been ready to denounce criminals in their midst and, if necessary, call the police. ''The premise that we do not deal with internal problems is false,'' Mr. Walcott said.</p>
        <p>MUCH the same point was made by Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, who -- as a Puerto Rican, a father and a husband, he said -- has strongly denounced the park violence, which followed the National Puerto Rican Day Parade. ''I think there's a misperception in the nonminority community that communities of color are somehow tolerant of crime, and speak out less on it,'' Mr. Ferrer said. ''It's true that communities of color have stepped out on the question of police misconduct. But they've also talked about crime.''</p>
        <p>Obviously, when race is the issue, you enter a minefield. Some black elected officials, Mr. Paterson noted, resent the idea that their opinions are often sought only when the subject is black crime. He has a point. Nobody calls on Jewish groups to denounce the Hasidim accused recently of flooding New York with the drug Ecstasy. Who expects politicians with Italian surnames to speak up every time the Gottis hit the headlines?</p>
        <p>Then again, Mr. Paterson said, black officials are more self-confident these days. You don't see them ducking for cover as much as in the past when, he said, they ''all too often thought of the ramifications first and doing what's right second.''</p>
        <p>Another elected official from Harlem, City Councilman Bill Perkins, said it would be nice now to see one more thing change: male attitudes. ''Young men who were not part of that park scene,'' he said, ''have to get up and say, 'This is not us.' ''</p>
