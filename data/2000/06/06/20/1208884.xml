        <p>The Supreme Court ruled today that a recent law that suspends certain federal court orders governing conditions in state and local prisons does not amount to an unconstitutional interference by Congress into the business of the federal courts.</p>
        <p>The 5-to-4 decision upheld a provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act under which judges must either rule on the continuing validity of an ongoing prison injunction within 90 days -- when its validity is challenged by the state or anyone else -- or find the injunction automatically suspended until they do rule.</p>
        <p>The challenged provision was one part of a far-reaching law, passed in 1995, by which Congress sought to curb lawsuits by prisoners and to cut back on the power of federal courts to keep state and local prisons under long-term federal supervision.</p>
        <p>The law set tough new standards for issuing injunctions governing ''conditions of confinement'' and authorized any interested party to go to court and challenge an existing injunction as not meeting those standards. In order to make sure that judges would pay prompt attention to such challenges, Congress included an ''automatic stay'' provision by which the injunction would be lifted until the judge ruled.</p>
        <p>Ruling on a challenge brought by inmates in an Indiana prison who opposed the state's effort to invoke the law, the federal appeals court in Chicago declared the automatic-stay provision unconstitutional. A legislative determination that a specific court order had to be set aside violated the separation of powers, it said.</p>
        <p>In overturning that ruling, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's majority opinion rejected the court's characterization of what the provision accomplished. The automatic stay did not interfere with a court's final judgment, Justice O'Connor said, because an ongoing injunction ''remains subject to alteration due to changes in the underlying law.''</p>
        <p>The new standards in the prison act were such a change, Justice O'Connor said, requiring an order governing prison conditions to be ''narrowly drawn,'' to go ''no further than necessary,'' and to be ''the least intrusive means necessary'' to correct the violation. Congress specified that the law should apply retroactively to make any ongoing prison injunction subject to ''immediate termination'' if it cannot meet those standards.</p>
        <p>The case, Miller v. French, No. 99-224, put the administration in an uncomfortable position. Although President Clinton had signed the law, administration lawyers could not avoid the fact that it raised troubling constitutional questions. In defending the stay provision before the Supreme Court, the administration proposed a new reading of the provision. The automatic stay was not quite what it appeared to be, the Solicitor General's office argued; it did not strip federal judges of their traditional authority to maintain the status quo in pending litigation. Judges themselves could grant a stay of the stay, the government said, and avoid the separation of powers problem.</p>
        <p>While the State of Indiana, which also appealed the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, was nominally on the administration's side, the two briefs diverged dramatically. The state, asking the court to uphold the law as written, said the administration's interpretation flew in the face of Congress's intent to make the stay automatic.</p>
        <p>In her majority opinion today, Justice O'Connor agreed with the state and rejected the administration's view. ''Any attempt to enjoin the stay is irreconcilable with the plain language of the statute,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Seven of the nine justices agreed with the statutory interpretation. In addition to the five in the majority -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas, along with Justice O'Connor -- Justices David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed that the law could not be read to allow flexibility.</p>
        <p>But there the two groups parted company. In a dissenting opinion,  Justices Souter and Ginsburg said that while the law did not raise a separation of powers problem, the deadline it imposed for judicial action was so short as to raise a question of whether the law violated the constitutional right to due process. They said the case should be sent back to the lower courts on the due process implications.</p>
        <p>The majority opinion also noted that the law ''may implicate due process concerns'' but said that this issue was not part of the case.</p>
        <p>The only two members of the court to accept the administration's interpretation of the statute were Justices Stephen G. Breyer and John Paul Stevens.</p>
        <p>With eight cases remaining until the end of the court term, there were these developments today.</p>
        <p>H.M.O. Case</p>
        <p>The court summarily vacated and sent back to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania a case in which the state court allowed a medical negligence case to proceed against a health maintenance organization for refusing to authorize a member's admission to the nearest hospital, which was not a plan participant.</p>
        <p>The question in the case, United States Healthcare Systems v. Pennsylvania Hospital Insurance Co., No. 98-1836, is whether a suit of this type can be heard in state court or whether, as the H.M.O. is arguing, it is pre-empted by a federal law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.</p>
        <p>Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal law, known as Erisa, does not provide a basis for suing an H.M.O. for giving doctors a financial incentive to ration health care. But the decision left open questions about the pre-emptive effect of Erisa in cases involving benefits eligibility and the general administration of a health plan.</p>
        <p>Speedy Judgment</p>
        <p>The justices agreed to decide whether, when free speech interests are at stake, the Constitution requires a prompt judicial determination of a challenge to a state or local licensing law. The case is an appeal by the owner of an adult bookstore in Waukesha, Wis., challenging the city's refusal to renew the store's operating license in a proceeding that lasted for many months.</p>
        <p>While the Supreme Court has required ''prompt judicial review'' in similar cases, it is unclear whether that means prompt access to court, or a prompt decision, or at least a provision to preserve the status quo during a lengthy process. The case, City News and Novelty v. City of Waukesha, No. 99-1680, is an appeal from the Wisconsin Court of Appeals.</p>
