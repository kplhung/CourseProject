        <p>Ever since Richard Nixon proposed it in 1968, policy makers have talked about having the federal government quit the business of enriching uranium for nuclear power plants. It took decades, but the Clinton administration finally completed the job two years ago, with Vice President Al Gore claiming it as a victory for reinventing government. It may, however, have come at the worst possible time.</p>
        <p>The government never ran the enterprise particularly well. But since privatization, the company has done much worse.</p>
        <p>The price of shares in the United States Enrichment Corporation, as the new company is known, closed today at $4.6875, down from $17.50 soon after the initial public offering in July 1998. Orders are down, costs per unit are up, and the price of USEC's only product is declining.</p>
        <p>Now the issue is at a turning point. The corporation's board is meeting here on Wednesday to discuss closing one of its two sprawling plants -- in Portsmouth, Ohio, or Paducah, Ky. -- in an effort to prevent the company from sliding into bankruptcy. This afternoon, the company released a copy of its formal notification to the Treasury that its bonds had reached junk rating, which, under the legislation that created it, allows it to close a plant.</p>
        <p>There is intense jockeying by each plant to be the survivor, but outsiders believe the survivor could soon close, too, dragging down with it the other parts in the fuel production chain from uranium mining, already at a low ebb, to the fabrication of nuclear fuel. Outside experts say that to maintain its market share, USEC has been signing contracts lately for less than its cost of production. As a government operation, that is costly; as a private enterprise it is a recipe for disaster.</p>
        <p>Even United States Enrichment's former parent, the Energy Department, acknowledges some apprehension. ''We are not convinced they are driving themselves into bankruptcy,'' said T. J. Glauthier, the deputy energy secretary, ''but the management challenge is great.''</p>
        <p>Several members of Congress, meanwhile, are talking about reversing the whole process by renationalizing the company.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's a precedent for this,'' said Representative Ted Strickland, Democrat of Ohio, whose district includes the Portsmouth plant. But prospects for the company are so poor that various parties are raising the specter that the United States could become dependent on imports to fuel the nuclear reactors that provide 20 percent of the nation's electrical power. Whether there is enough support to bail out the company or repurchase it remains to be seen, but the law under which the government sold the factories calls for maintaining a ''viable'' domestic industry.</p>
        <p>Uranium enrichment is an arcane business that consists of laboriously sorting through two different types of uranium to raise the proportion of the more valuable kind, U-235, from the 0.7 percent that exists in nature to the 5 percent or so needed for power reactors or to the highly concentrated state used in weapons.</p>
        <p>The market price of a unit of enrichment has fallen in recent years from more than $100 to about $80 now. The United States, using technology developed in World War II to make bombs, is the highest-cost producer. By contrast, the Russians, using newer technology, can make money selling such enrichment units at $30 or above, experts say.</p>
        <p>One possibility is for United States Enrichment to buy a share in a European producer, Urenco, which is now owned by the governments of Britain, Germany and the Netherlands; the stakes held by the Germans and the Dutch are on the market, and Urenco has newer technology, which uses centrifuges.</p>
        <p>The central problem facing USEC is that the international industry is set up to supply enough uranium enrichment for all the reactors that were planned 30 years ago, though many were never built. At the same time, the need for weapons-grade uranium has been reversed; work done years ago to make bomb fuel is now used for reactor fuel, reducing the need for the factories.</p>
        <p>''You've got an industry that's very well set up for the 1970's,'' said William H. Timbers Jr., the president and chief executive of United States Enrichment. ''It has to restructure.''</p>
        <p>And that is just what he insists it is prepared to do. The company, he said in an interview, has the ''ability to take some tough, difficult decisions.''</p>
        <p>Estimates vary, but world demand for nuclear fuel is around 36 million units a year, while the supply is 42 million units. And since uranium has limited uses, price declines do not stimulate demand.</p>
        <p>''It's an inelastic market,'' said Richard D. Miller, a consultant for the union that represents most workers at the two plants. No matter how far the price falls, he said, ''we're not going to put it on our cereal.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Miller and others say that USECitself has brought on some of its own problems. Under the terms of its privatization, it was supposed to keep the two plants open until 2004. But it is allowed to close one earlier if its bonds drop below investment grade; some critics say the company engineered just that, through a stock buyback that created a less favorable debt-to-equity ratio.</p>
        <p>Some problems were clearly inherited. In 1993, Mr. Gore and Boris N. Yeltsin, then president of Russia, struck a deal for the Russians to take high-enriched uranium from bombs and dilute it for use in American power reactors.</p>
        <p>That deal has had its ups and downs, in part, critics say, because United States Enrichment, which inherited the deal when it was privatized, is not eager to see Russian uranium displace so much of its own production. Company officials deny this, but in any case, the Russian deal represents about 90 million enrichment units over 20 years, or enough to meet about half the domestic demand. So while beating swords into plowshares may make sense as a national policy, it is tough on the companies that make plowshares. Some people think the Russian deal was USEC's undoing.</p>
        <p>''Why does this industry and these workers have to pay the whole cost of peace?,'' asked Daniel J. Minter, president of the union local at Portsmouth, which, after recent layoffs, represents just under 1,000 workers. ''You couldn't have picked anything more difficult to privatize. The Pentagon would have been easier.''</p>
        <p>Last year United States Enrichment's managers asked the Energy Department for $200 million to help them over their troubles but failed to convince officials there that the Russian deal had caused any unexpected difficulties. Paying executives salaries commensurate with those of private industry is also a sore point.</p>
        <p>The company began its life, meanwhile, with a huge stock of its raw material, unenriched uranium hexafluoride, a kind of dowry from the government, and has been selling it, to pay dividends and other costs. Partly as a result, the price of a  pound of uranium is down sharply,  forcing some mines to shut down. The nation's sole company for converting uranium ore into uranium hexafluoride, the form that USEC uses, says it is near a shutdown, too.</p>
        <p>''The irony of this privatization,'' said Thomas L. Neff, a senior scientist at the Center for International Studies at M.I.T., who first conceived the Russian uranium deal, ''is that the government set something out there, with various goodies, that did a lot of collateral damage. The government subsidized an entity that's destroying everything else.''</p>
