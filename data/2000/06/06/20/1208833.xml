        <p>With a German husband, 13 years in Germany and three children born here, Stacy Wiedenmann of Chicago thought she had a fair grasp of her adoptive land. But that was before Cora stepped into her life.</p>
        <p>Cora is a mid-size black mongrel that scarcely advertises her power to metamorphose a life. But take her out onto the leafy streets of Berlin and the effect on people is dramatic: German reserve abruptly gives way to Neapolitan gregariousness.</p>
        <p>How sweet, the passers-by coo as they coddle Cora, how simply lovely. When did you get her? Where? Is she already house-trained? Well, isn't that something! How about meeting to walk our dogs and compare notes?</p>
        <p>Mrs. Wiedenmann, 39, is in a state of shock. She had one child, then another, then a third, walked with them in her neighborhood and nobody ever said a word. No candy was offered, no hair ruffled, no age asked, no tenderness displayed. The children seemed as invisible as Cora now seems conspicuous.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing; everyone suddenly talks to me,'' said Mrs. Wiedenmann, who acquired Cora a few weeks ago. ''Perhaps Germans like dogs more than kids; certainly they talk to you through dogs. I think they feel more comfortable because a child is personal, perhaps too personal. So a dog becomes the ideal passport to social contact.''</p>
        <p>This is a formal country, full of regulations governing everything from times of day when children are supposed to be quiet to the lace curtains to be placed on certain windows. But dogs defy Germanic rules -- unleashing passions, unbuttoning the standoffish, unveiling a charged universe of canine chaos.</p>
        <p>So charged that Otto Schily, the Interior Minister, recently spent two days locked in dog discussions with his counterparts in Germany's 16 states. Newspapers were full of images of raging pit bulls and hideous dog-bite wounds as the ministers debated what to do about the growing number of so-called Kampfhunde, or attack dogs.</p>
        <p>Even the weighty weekly Die Zeit joined the fray with a prominent article offering the view that, ''If nuclear power stations in this country had caused as many dead and injured people as attack dogs, they would all have been shut down a long time ago.''</p>
        <p>When Berlin's Interior Minister proposed a ban on Kampfhunde, the owners of such dogs called for a demonstration at which their pets would wear a Star of David meant to symbolize what they claimed was Hitler's comparable hounding of Jews. After protests from the Jewish organizations, an apology was offered and the idea withdrawn.</p>
        <p>Such was the general brouhaha that the ministers were unable to reach any firm decisions. In a statement last month, they noted the importance of appropriate training, suggested that the aggressivity of a particular breed was not easy to assess, and left states to determine whether certain dogs deemed dangerous should be banned, heavily taxed, or made available only with special licenses.</p>
        <p>In effect, nothing changed. With approximately 200,000 dogs in Berlin, perhaps 14,000 of them attack dogs, and an estimated 50,000 people a year getting bitten by dogs in Germany, tensions between dog owners and their opponents continue to run high.</p>
        <p>''The German dog lobby is like the Miami Cuban lobby -- nobody can touch it,'' said Peter Schneider, a Berlin author distressed by the ministers' indecision and this city's proliferation of dogs. (The Berlin police reported 2,600 bites in the city last year, compared with 1,750 in 1998.)</p>
        <p>''The dog is so close to the German soul that not even an estimated 20 tons of dog excrement a day, much of it on the street, produces an official response.''</p>
        <p>It is true that while in general Germans see their role as not only obeying laws but also enforcing them -- denouncing a car illegally parked or a branch illegally cut from a protected tree -- they display no similar zeal for reporting canine infractions like soiling city streets to the police. At once objects of love and complete control, dogs thrive here.</p>
        <p>In an essay called ''Of Dogs and Germans,'' inspired a decade ago by an outburst of national soul-searching over what to do with the 5,000 dogs that had guarded the Berlin Wall and were marooned by its fall, Mr. Schneider concluded that a German without a German shepherd was incomplete and that the German capacity to empathize with a dog's suffering was boundless.</p>
        <p>''When Adolf Hitler was so disappointed with his Germans that he shot himself inside his bunker, he not only left his people without their Fuhrer, but a German shepherd without its master -- an event that inspired Gunter Grass to write a 700-page novel entitled 'Dog Years,' '' he noted.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Wiedenmann's own dog years have just begun; to keep them calm she has enrolled Cora at Pro Dog.</p>
        <p>Courses at Pro Dog, an obedience school for mutts and pedigrees alike, include seminars on dog psychology, leash technique and human-canine communication. Training is also offered in ''high-stress dog situations'', such as riding the subway and taking your dog shopping or to a restaurant, all popular practices here.</p>
        <p>The 10-week courses are of a kind widely followed in a country where dog discipline is taken seriously and woods echo to the come-hither cry of ''Platz!'' The courses lead to a qualification called Hundefuhrerschein I,  a sort of dog degree.</p>
        <p>An advanced degree, comparable to a dog doctorate and known as Hundefuhrerschein II, involves advanced canine concepts such as managing your dog without a leash. It can be had with another 10 weeks of study under Renate Albrecht, the animal psychologist in charge.</p>
        <p>''There is no such thing as a bad breed of dog, only bad and ignorant dog owners,'' contended Ms. Albrecht, who trained in Switzerland. ''All this talk about attack dogs is rubbish meant to generate mass hysteria and pressure politicians to do something. The only thing required is that people learn how to look after their dogs.''</p>
        <p>To illustrate her point, Ms. Albrecht has five dogs -- Charlotte, Amanda, Archibald, Goofy and Bandit -- four of which are mastiff-like dogues de Bordeaux that are officially classified as Kampfhunde. The official danger list also includes pit bulls and American Staffordshire bull terriers.</p>
        <p>The dogs sprawl on her office floor, presenting nothing more menacing than their snoring and their intermittent stench. Apologizing for the smell, Ms. Albrecht explained that a dog is not a human.</p>
        <p>It is enough to squeeze a dog's nose to convey displeasure, Ms. Albrecht noted. She squeezed Amanda's amorphous nose to show what she meant; Amanda acquiesced. ''You see how good she is,'' Ms. Albrecht said.</p>
        <p>But not everybody sees that goodness. ''People regularly come up to me when I am walking my dogs and say the dogs should be gassed,'' said Ms. Albrecht. ''Can you imagine? Gassed. With our history. Gas them all, they say. It makes me shudder.''</p>
        <p>The obverse of such anger is an overflowing canine compassion. Take Cora. Her mother was found injured on a Greek beach and brought to Berlin for treatment. Abandoned dogs are regularly brought back from vacations in Spain and Italy for salvation through German goodness.</p>
        <p>''People here are crazy,'' said Mrs. Wiedenmann. ''They'll do anything for a dog and they really, deeply believe that dogs should be well-adjusted psychologically.''</p>
