        <p>People are used to watching them: National Football League players performing in front of roaring crowds, getting bloodied and mud-caked while knocking heads for 60 minutes every Sunday.</p>
        <p>But for one Sunday, some of the most excitable and (legally) violent athletes in America stopped to watch Tiger Woods barely sweat and hit that little white ball to record the greatest victory margin of golf's four majors -- his United States Open triumph on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Today, many of the players who will compete in this week's Cadillac N.F.L. Golf Classic said they had watched Woods's performance, not as fans, but as fellow athletes, and were awed.</p>
        <p>They looked for the tell-tale signs that measure the difference between winning and losing. They looked for facial expressions. They looked for confidence. They looked, it seemed, at themselves as well.</p>
        <p>''I looked at him as an athlete,'' said O. J. Anderson, the running back who helped the Giants win a Super Bowl 10 years ago. ''It takes consistency. We take our hats off to those who can play so consistently. I may go out and hit 100 balls. They hit 500 balls. But the way he played Sunday, knowing he could set records and the pressure that meant -- and he plays flawless golf.</p>
        <p>''I hope to play Pebble Beach one day. But I'll bring a lot of balls.''</p>
        <p>Ed (Too Tall) Jones, the former Cowboys All-Pro defensive end, noticed something about Woods at what could have been the start of a disastrous finish -- a triple-bogey on No. 3 on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''I liked the smile he flashed after that,'' Jones said. ''He is mature. That's what takes young players to another level.''</p>
        <p>''I used to think of golf as the worst kind of sport to play,'' said Harry Carson, the former Giants linebacker and now a once-a-week golfer. ''It was a sport with nothing coming at you, nothing to stop you. But now I'm watching to see what I can pick up when I look at the great golfers. What I saw in Tiger is that I'm a better football player than I am a golfer.''</p>
        <p>And while Carson said that ''Woods never tried to stop a fullback from making a first down,'' the former player said, ''hitting a drive is tougher.''</p>
        <p>For Neil O'Donnell, winding up his career at Tennessee, Woods's laid-back demeanor was impressive. O'Donnell has always attempted to remain unruffled, to avoid distractions on and off the field. It did not work in his stint with the Jets under Bill Parcells.</p>
        <p>''He could be a star in any sport,'' O'Donnell said. ''Maybe not football, but baseball, certainly. He's always attacking the ball. He had a 10-stroke lead the final day and still went at it. He made my Father's Day.''</p>
        <p>Jack Ham, who won four Super Bowls as a Steelers linebacker, said: ''I equate the U.S. Open to a Super Bowl. One shot and you're out. One play changes an entire game. His mentality -- what amazed me is his triple-bogey. You doubt yourself when something like that happens. At that moment, does it get away from him, or does he turn it around? He gets a birdie.</p>
        <p>''I don't care how confident you are, how much of a lead you have. When things go negative so early, it can ruin you. He's too tough.''</p>
        <p>For Marty Lyons, the former Jets defensive lineman who used to rile up his team by throwing things in the locker room before games, Woods's greatness begins with ''his mental attitude.'' Lyons described it as similar to Michael Jordan's, or Wayne Gretzky's, or Dan Marino's or John Elway's.</p>
        <p>''I appreciated what Johnny Miller said of him,'' Lyons said. ''He said that Tiger has that inner peace, never gets rattled.''</p>
        <p>Leon Johnson's Career in Doubt</p>
        <p>Leon Johnson's once-promising Jets' career appears to be over because of a knee injury he sustained at minicamp. It had been his first appearance on a field since he sustained anterior cruciate ligament and medial cruciate ligament damage to his left knee in last season's opening game. He underwent surgery then -- and was forced to have another operation on the same knee after this latest mishap.</p>
        <p>The Jets have not acknowledged the recent surgery, since both Coach Al Groh and the club's chief football officer, Bill Parcells, are on vacation.</p>
        <p>As a rookie in 1997, Johnson became the first Jet to return both a punt and a kickoff for a touchdown, and ranked among the league leaders in punt returns. His career did not progress in 1998, though, when he was slowed by knee and rib injuries.</p>
