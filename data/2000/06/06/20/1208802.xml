        <p>Emergency angioplasty is a proven way to save the lives of patients having heart attacks, but two new studies suggest that for it to be most effective, time is of the essence.</p>
        <p>One report, by researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital, found that for the best survival rate, the procedure should be done within two hours after a patient arrives at the hospital. The study looked at more than 27,000 heart attack patients treated at 661 hospitals from 1994 to 1998.</p>
        <p>''Over the time period, only about 50 percent met this goal of less than two hours,'' said Dr. Christopher P. Cannon, the lead author. ''So we've got some work to do.''</p>
        <p>In angioplasty, a balloon is threaded through a patient's arteries to the heart and then expanded, clearing the blocked artery so that that blood can resume pumping normally. Angioplasty can also be done as an elective procedure.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cannon, who reported his findings in last week's Journal of the American Medical Association, said that when delays of more than two hours occurred, the mortality rate rose by 40 to 60 percent.</p>
        <p>The other study appeared last month in The New England Journal of Medicine and confirmed the longstanding belief that patients given emergency angioplasties at hospitals that perform large numbers of the procedures have lower mortality rates. Patients who went to high-volume hospitals had a 28 percent lower mortality rate in the hospital, amounting to two fewer deaths for every 100 patients treated.</p>
        <p>The prevailing theory holds that surgeons get better with practice.</p>
        <p>But the lead author of the study, Dr. John G. Canto of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said researchers had also found that the failure of smaller hospitals to administer the angioplasty quickly enough appeared to play a role.</p>
        <p>The two studies said the speed of getting an angioplasty in place should be considered when doctors weighed whether to use the balloon therapy or administer so-called clot-buster drugs.</p>
