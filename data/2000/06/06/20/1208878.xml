        <p>Senators of both parties condemned crimes based on race, sex or sexual orientation as a dishonor to the nation today in an emotional prelude to a vote scheduled for Tuesday on creating a federal hate crimes statute.</p>
        <p>Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, confident of passing the legislation, called offenses like the killings of James Byrd Jr. and Matthew Shepard ''modern-day lynchings that can easily terrorize whole communities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy, the bill's chief sponsor, called it the necessary next step in civil rights legislation, representing ''a continuum of this nation attempting to define what this nation ought to be, that is a nation that is going to be free from discrimination, hatred and bigotry.'' The bill would allow the federal government to prosecute crimes motivated by race, gender and sexual orientation that are now outside its reach.</p>
        <p>Senator Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, the bill's leading Republican backer, pointedly addressed conservative Christians. He said they had told him they feared that any legislation favorable to gays threatened the American family. To answer that, he quoted from Scripture the story of the woman who had committed adultery, when Jesus said, ''He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith said, ''Adultery is a far greater threat to the American family than homosexuality,'' and if an adulterer could be forgiven by Jesus, ''it is time to say to the gay community, 'We don't agree with you on everything, but I can help you on many things.' ''</p>
        <p>The only opposition to the Kennedy-Smith bill came from Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who heads the Judiciary Committee. He said no one had shown that federal intervention was necessary and that the Supreme Court's recent decisions on federalism foreshadowed a ruling that Congress had no business making federal crimes of what were basically state offenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hatch said he believed that ''hate-related violence is to be abhorred.''</p>
        <p>''Nobody can deny that hate crimes are occurring,'' he said. ''I want to get rid of them as much as anybody.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hatch said he might eventually be convinced that a new federal crime law was needed. But, he said, all the Senate should do was to demand a report on the effectiveness of existing law enforcement efforts on hate crimes and to provide grants to states to help them with such cases.</p>
        <p>The Kennedy-Smith bill would also provide grants to states to help pay for prosecutions. But its major provision would be to create a federal offense of crimes involving bodily injury based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation or disability. Mr. Kennedy stressed that the federal government would act only if states approved, or if they failed to pursue a case.</p>
        <p>Existing federal law deals only with crimes based on race, religion and national origin, and only in cases in which the victims had been seeking to exercise a federally protected right. Those include school enrollment, jury service, traveling in interstate commerce and using a place of public accommodation.</p>
        <p>Even if the Senate adopts the measure, a direct vote on it in the House is no more than a remote possibility, because of Republican opposition. But strong White House support could force House leaders to accept it in the wrap-up legislation needed to end the session and let lawmakers go home to campaign for re-election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shepard was a gay 21-year-old student who was beaten to death in Laramie, Wyo., in October 1998. Earlier that year, Mr. Byrd, a 49-year-old black man, was dragged to his death in Jasper, Tex. The killers in both cases were convicted, but proponents of the Kennedy-Smith proposal said the bill would have made it easier to prosecute them and would have avoided financial burdens on local law enforcement.</p>
        <p>As evidence that a new law was needed, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, cited not only the Shepard and Byrd killings, but also a series of attacks on gay men in Michigan. In those cases, he said, the prosecutions would have been stronger if the federal government had been involved.</p>
        <p>''In one united voice,'' Mr. Levin said, ''we must not only condemn these acts of violence that terrorize Americans every day, we must act against them. America's agenda will remain unfinished so long as incidents like these occur regularly.''</p>
        <p>Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, said the current law was ''way too narrow'' and hate crimes were the equivalent of terrorism against a group or community.</p>
        <p>Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, said that for that reason, ''crimes motivated by hate are especially harmful.''</p>
        <p>Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said the Hatch argument was all too familiar. ''It's not a federal issue,'' he said, was the same attack made on legislation to protect the rights of blacks, women and the disabled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hatch complained that supporters of the legislation were just ''making political points here on the floor.''</p>
        <p>The bill was also supported by three more Democrats, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic whip, who said, ''People should not be killed because they are different.''</p>
