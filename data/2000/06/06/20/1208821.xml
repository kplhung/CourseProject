        <p>Two art institutions with visions of expansion but strikingly different economic positions -- the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia -- have reached an agreement to share their collections, organize joint exhibitions and help each other develop a worldwide network of museums.</p>
        <p>The Guggenheim, with museums in New York and three European cities, has long had an interest in sharing the Hermitage's world-class collection of old master, Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works, antiquities and decorative arts. The Hermitage, with severe budgetary problems, has envied the Guggenheim's financial resources and entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mikhail B. Piotrovsky, director of the Hermitage, whose vision has been severely hampered by the lack of funds, described the collaboration as ''One plus one makes three.''</p>
        <p>''We have two brands and can cooperate in different kinds of activities in different parts of the world,'' he said in a telephone interview yesterday from St. Petersburg. ''This is not just about fund-raising and development. It's about creating the model for museums of the 21st century.''</p>
        <p>Neither Dr. Piotrovsky nor Thomas Krens, director of the Guggenheim, would discuss what kinds of financial commitments were part of the agreement, if any. But if they accomplish most of what they say they intend to, this would probably be the most extensive collaboration between two world-class museums.</p>
        <p>The largest cooperative agreement reached recently by art institutions was between the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan and the Tate Gallery in London, which have formed a partnership to create an Internet business for art, culture and design. The Hermitage has also collaborated in a limited way with the Modern.</p>
        <p>In St. Petersburg, the Guggenheim is to become a partner in the $100 million development of the east wing of the 400,000-square-foot former General Staff Building, built in the 19th century on Palace Square, facing the Winter Palace of the Hermitage. The Russian government, which owns the building, has agreed to transfer it to the Hermitage. For two years the museum has been accepting proposals from developers for turning the building and its surrounding courtyards into a cultural compound.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krens said he had appointed a group of three architects whom he declined to name to put together a proposal to use 400 of the building's 610 rooms for cultural purposes, including art and technology galleries and film-viewing rooms. The rest of the site would be used for shops and a hotel.</p>
        <p>The project would house galleries for major portions of the Hermitage's collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings, along with its collections of sculpture, costumes, arms and armor, jewelry and decorative arts. It would also include postwar modern and contemporary art, multimedia installations and photography from the Guggenheim's collections.</p>
        <p>The Guggenheim said it was ready to help in the planning and design of its gallery spaces as well as with exhibition programming that would focus on modern and contemporary art.</p>
        <p>In exchange, the Hermitage would have a presence at a proposed additional Guggenheim museum in Manhattan. A suite of galleries devoted to works from the Hermitage would become part of the plan for a new Guggenheim museum to be designed by the Los Angeles architect Frank O. Gehry for three piers at Wall Street on the East River. The plan is one of several by various sponsors for the city-owned site, with a selection expected sometime this year.</p>
        <p>The collaboration is also to include exchanges between the Hermitage and the Guggenheim's existing museums: its Fifth Avenue headquarters designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and its sister museums in Bilbao, Spain; Venice; and Berlin.</p>
        <p>The agreement will also open the way for the Guggenheim to assist the Hermitage on various international projects.</p>
        <p>In addition to its two million square feet of exhibition space in St. Petersburg, the Hermitage will open a suite of eight rooms later this year in London at Somerset House, a late 18th-century mansion, where it plans to mount rotating exhibitions.</p>
        <p>The Hermitage also plans to transform a home for the elderly in Amsterdam into a satellite museum in 2006.</p>
        <p>In a statement to be issued today, the two museums say they also plan to collaborate on developing and building other museums around the world. After the success of the Guggenheim Bilbao in the Basque region, which opened in 1997 and has had a million visitors a year, it has been approached by various cities with requests to study possible new museums.</p>
        <p>''We've both been approached by many, many, many cities around the world,'' said Mr. Krens. ''By joining together and approaching these projects as a joint venture, we can mobilize quality and content.''</p>
        <p>The two institutions may well be a good fit. The Hermitage collections stop at the beginning of the 20th century. The Guggenheim's range from the late 19th century to the present, with strong representation of postwar and contemporary art.</p>
        <p>The Guggenheim has a history of organizing exhibitions of Russian art, including ''The Great Utopia: The Russian and Soviet Avant-Garde, 1915-1932,'' in 1992, and ''Amazons of the Avant-Garde: Aleksandra Exter, Natalya Gonscharova, Liubov Popova, Olga Rozanova, Varvara Stepanova and Nadezhda Udaltsova,'' which opened at the Guggenheim in Berlin last year, then traveled to the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice and is currently on view in Bilbao. It is to open at the Guggenheim in Manhattan in September.</p>
        <p>''We've been involved with Russia for 12 years,'' said Mr. Krens. ''And have built trust and confidence over the years.''</p>
