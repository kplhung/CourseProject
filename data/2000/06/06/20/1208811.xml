        <p>Competition in the commercial spy business's outer-space satellite imagery sector is heating up as Russia enters the fray. A sample photo, showing New York harbor, with an inset showing City Hall, was taken in 1994 by a Russian military spy satellite hundreds of miles up and was just made available commercially in the United States by Central Trading Systems, in Huntington, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Moscow is thus beginning to match in sharpness the images taken by the reconnaissance satellite of Space Imaging, a company based in Thornton, Colo. The company launched its craft in September, offering the first close-up commercial images from space with a resolution down to one meter, or about three feet. At that resolution, cars, roads, buildings, tanks, ships, jets and missiles can be distinguished.</p>

        <p>Competition in the commercial spy business's outer-space satellite imagery sector is heating up as Russia enters the fray. A sample photo, showing New York harbor, with an inset showing City Hall, was taken in 1994 by a Russian military spy satellite hundreds of miles up and was just made available commercially in the United States by Central Trading Systems, in Huntington, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Moscow is thus beginning to match in sharpness the images taken by the reconnaissance satellite of Space Imaging, a company based in Thornton, Colo. The company launched its craft in September, offering the first close-up commercial images from space with a resolution down to one meter, or about three feet. At that resolution, cars, roads, buildings, tanks, ships, jets and missiles can be distinguished.</p>
        <p>The Russians are now responding with data that they say goes from the present back to 1992. ''Substantial areas of the U.S., Europe and the Middle East as well as selected areas in South America and the Far East are included in the archives and available,'' said a statement from Central Trading.</p>
        <p>This is likely to affect American sales, too. In 1996, American supporters of Israel helped pass a law limiting the sharpness of American images of Israel to the best obtainable by any foreign company. Now the Russian entry is seen as likely to end the ban.</p>
        <p>Supplying the Russian satellite imagery is an agency called Sovinformsputnik, which has a Web site, www.sovinformsputnik.com. The site offers samples of the imagery and allows customers to submit orders for images.</p>
