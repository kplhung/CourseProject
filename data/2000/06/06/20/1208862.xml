        <p>British customs officers searching a consignment of imported tomatoes aboard a Dutch truck in this Channel port early today were horrified to find the bodies of 58 Asian men and women inside the dark, airless space.</p>
        <p>It was not clear how the people in the truck -- presumed to be poor migrants being smuggled into Britain -- had died. But the suspicion was suffocation after it was discovered that the refrigeration equipment had been switched off, the doors had been locked from the outside and there was scant ventilation. With temperatures reaching 91 degrees, Sunday was the hottest day in Britain so far this year.</p>
        <p>Two men survived and were taken to a Kent County hospital, and the driver, identified only as a citizen of the Netherlands, was arrested. The victims -- all adults and all but four of them men -- were described as ''Orientals'' until a more accurate national identity could be established. A majority of Asians who try to enter Britain surreptitiously are thought to be Chinese.</p>
        <p>Mark Pugash, spokesman for the Kent police, said the two survivors were expected to recover, though he added, ''It's hard to say 'non-life-threatening' when you consider the trauma they went through.''</p>
        <p>Their security, he said, was a top priority, and they were being closely guarded. ''This kind of thing doesn't happen spontaneously on this scale,'' he said. ''It takes a lot of planning and finance and coordination, and if you were one of those responsible for it, you wouldn't want to have any survivors around afterward.''</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair -- speaking in Portugal, where he was attending a European summit meeting -- said the discovery of the bodies demonstrated the importance of stamping out the ''evil trade in people.''</p>
        <p>According to the Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's intelligence section  says at least 20 criminal groups are actively involved in bringing illegal immigrants into Britain and forcing them into farm or service jobs at low wages. Small groups of bewildered, frightened and sickly foreigners emerging from the backs of vehicles have become a common sight at Dover and other Channel ports.</p>
        <p>In London, Home Secretary Jack Straw told the House of Commons: ''This particular incident is now subject to a major police investigation. The government is determined to continue to crack down on the evil trade in such trafficking, whose perpetrators have no regard for human life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pugash said he had spoken to the police and customs officers who first came upon the grisly sight. ''Nothing had prepared them for what they found in that lorry,'' he said. ''They were absolutely appalled, absolutely traumatized.''</p>
        <p>Nigel Knott, a Customs spokesman, said the truck, one of the 4,000 that pass through Dover's Eastern Docks terminal daily, had been singled out for inspection just after midnight because it fit a ''profile'' developed by officials to identify vehicles suspected of transporting contraband. The Dutch-registered truck had just made the four-and-a-half hour crossing from Zeebrugge on a freight-only ship of the P &amp; O Stena Line.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knott declined to say what characteristics aroused suspicions, but a spokeswoman for the P &amp; O shipping line said that the driver had paid cash for the trip and that the company to which the truck was registered, Van Der Spek, was unknown.</p>
        <p>Using a forklift, the customs inspectors unloaded stacked crates of tomatoes from the 58-foot truck that in effect formed a wall blocking what was behind. ''It is common for us to find veneers, if you will, or false bulkheads like this put up to hide things,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A single customs officer climbed into the exposed space, where he made the discovery, Mr. Knott said. Emergency services were summoned, and the police took over the case. Two pathologists from the Home Office arrived from London this morning to conduct autopsies to determine how the victims died.</p>
        <p>This afternoon, scattered tomatoes and pieces of wood still lay on the concrete loading dock where customs officers, working in the dim amber light of the unloading shed, had thrown them when they discovered the gruesome human cargo. Forensic specialists dressed in white full-body suits picked over the wilted vegetables and broken wood slats today while the doctors worked inside a refrigeration hangar next door that has been converted into an emergency morgue.</p>
        <p>A rolling flotilla of large ferries kept landing at the piers, which lie at the base of Dover's famous white cliffs. Trucks rolled down the gangplanks and then lumbered out the exits toward northbound highways. In midafternoon, one of them was stopped, and as reporters watched, six young men were escorted out a back door and marched into an interrogation office to see whether they had proper documentation.</p>
        <p>A surge in the number of people seeking asylum is a big political issue in Britain, an insular nation that has always felt the added security of having no overland borders with other countries, other than the one between Northern Ireland and Ireland.</p>
        <p>A record 75,000 people claimed asylum for the year that ended in February, compared with just over 49,000 the year before. The Kosovo war of last year, which prompted many Kosovo Albanians to seek refuge in the West, accounted for only some of the rise. There were larger influxes from Eastern Europe, Central Asia and, as the episode today seemed to illustrate, China.</p>
        <p>Although the requests of most of the asylum-seekers to Britain are denied, two-thirds of those who are refused evade the authorities and melt into the population in an effort to stay here. The government says it means to get tougher and is introducing plans to imprison and deport larger numbers of new arrivals. Immigration has been at the center of political debate in recent weeks, with the Conservative party leader, William Hague, making inroads on Mr. Blair's popularity by using deliberately emotive language in warning of the dangers of a ''flood of bogus asylum-seekers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair's government and the Conservative opposition joined today in denouncing the lucrative and exploitative business of smuggling human beings into Britain. Both Labor and Tory politicians stressed the need for closer examination of cargoes on the continental side of the Channel. ''I accept entirely that there is a need -- greatly -- for other countries to improve the checking of vehicles coming in here,'' Mr. Straw said.</p>
        <p>The government introduced tougher new measures this spring, including fining drivers $3,000 for each illegal foreign stowaway found in their trucks. About $1.8 million has been levied thus far, and a spokesman for Mr. Blair said today, ''As a result of that, there's been a 49 percent reduction in the number of clandestine entrants discovered in vehicles in this country.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Straw visited Dover in April to publicize the new regulations, he arrived at a moment when eight illegal immigrants had just been discovered in the back of a Czech truck.</p>
        <p>The government may boast of the effectiveness of the fines, but drivers and trucking companies have had a different reaction, contending that the government is penalizing them for the failures of the border control authorities.</p>
        <p>Drivers say that people clamber onto their rigs while they are parked in side roads, gas stations or restaurants while they wait to cross the channel, and that they have no way of knowing. ''It's like householder being fined for reporting a burglary,'' one company official told The Evening Standard.</p>
