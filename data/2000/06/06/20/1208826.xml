        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A June 14 letter asserts that the troubling standardized test score gap between black and white test takers is a result of unequal access to commercial test preparatory courses. While this theory is tempting, the evidence from one major testing program, the Law School Admission Test, does not support it.</p>
        <p>According to a recent study by the LSAT's sponsor, the Law School Admission Council (of which I am vice president), 28 percent of black LSAT takers in 1997 reported having attended a commercial test preparation school, compared with 31 percent of whites. The average score of those who took a commercial course was less than one point higher than those who did not take such a course.</p>

        <p>Most educators and test producers have been studying the issues, and no clear-cut reason other than differences in educational opportunity stands out as the major factor that produces the gap.</p>
