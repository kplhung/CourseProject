        <p>Embarrassed. The word slipped off the tongue too easily for too many Yankees on a dreary Sunday and on a pensive Monday. Manager Joe Torre was the first to express the emotion after Chicago pounded the Yankees, but Paul O'Neill followed Torre, Derek Jeter admitted concern and David Cone conceded that it was true. The Yankees were embarrassed and they did not like the queasy feeling.</p>
        <p>When you win three of the last four World Series, you do not have to use a revealing word like embarrassed too often. Not to explain how you feel. Maybe to explain how you just made opponents feel. But there were the Yankees, once proud and mighty, looking exasperated and discussing their embarrassment.</p>

        <p>Embarrassed. The word slipped off the tongue too easily for too many Yankees on a dreary Sunday and on a pensive Monday. Manager Joe Torre was the first to express the emotion after Chicago pounded the Yankees, but Paul O'Neill followed Torre, Derek Jeter admitted concern and David Cone conceded that it was true. The Yankees were embarrassed and they did not like the queasy feeling.</p>
        <p>When you win three of the last four World Series, you do not have to use a revealing word like embarrassed too often. Not to explain how you feel. Maybe to explain how you just made opponents feel. But there were the Yankees, once proud and mighty, looking exasperated and discussing their embarrassment.</p>
        <p>Embarrassment remained a prominent theme on Monday night, but the Yankees returned to dispensing the humiliation as they demolished the Red Sox, 22-1, at Fenway Park behind a relentless attack that featured homers from five different players and behind Ramiro Mendoza's effective pitching.</p>
        <p>This was a softball game. This was a game where the Yankees could finally feel relief. This was the most lopsided game in the history of the storied rivalry. Yes, the bumbling Red Sox felt the same way that the Yankees felt while getting battered by the White Sox, 17-4, on Sunday. Perhaps, since this was Yankees-Red Sox, they felt even worse.</p>
        <p>''It's embarrassing,'' Jason Varitek said. ''It doesn't matter if it's the hometown Little League. It's embarrassing for every one of us, the coaching staff, the players, the trainers, everybody.''</p>
        <p>From being embarrassed in the Bronx to being excited in Boston one day later, the Yankees were more relieved about finally winning a game. The score mattered to them about as much as the first names of the clubhouse attendants here.</p>
        <p>''It's a situation where you can't take yesterday into today,'' Jeter said. ''If you do that, you drive yourself crazy.''</p>
        <p>Shane Spencer mentioned that Pedro Martinez is pitching for the Red Sox Tuesday night, mentioned how baseball changes every day and said: ''We might not show up tomorrow. You just don't know.''</p>
        <p>Torre explained before the rout that the Yankees have always been able to win the games that they were supposed to win. This was one of those games since the Yankees had lost four straight and since their principal owner George Steinbrenner is monitoring the team closely this week before deciding what kind of potential personnel changes to make. Anti-Yankee chants filled Fenway and Chuck Knoblauch was taunted every time he made a throw to first base, which he did successfully on two occasions.</p>
        <p>But Mendoza pitched seven terrific innings in what might have been the biggest start of the season for a Yankee because it ended a losing streak and it allowed the team to exhale. He has always been a pitcher that Torre has protected and his value skyrocketed last night. Mendoza pitched a huge game on the same day the Yankees announced that Orlando Hernandez would seek a second opinion on his sprained right elbow and might wind up on the disabled list. The next announcement the Yankees should make is that Mendoza is not being traded. So, after admitting embarrassment and after managing 13 victories in their last 29 games, the Yankees jumped over Boston into first place. Still, this was one game, something several Yankees repeated as a reminder.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to sugarcoat it,'' Jeter said. ''We haven't played well. I'm not even talking wins and losses. Just being consistent. It gets old to say that it's still early. It's almost the All-Star break. It's not early anymore.''</p>
        <p>Indeed. Early or late in the season is a terrible time to lose Hernandez, who will have his elbow examined by the orthopedic surgeon James Andrews tomorrow in Birmingham, Ala. Torre knew why Hernandez wanted a second opinion and added, ''That's his career.''</p>
        <p>It could also be a major part of New York's season if El Duque is out for an extensive period, especially if the Yankees eventually try the suspect Dwight Gooden in the rotation.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner is expected to arrive in Boston today and he has made it clear that the seven games against the Red Sox and the White Sox on this road trip are crucial. One Yankees official said Steinbrenner is pushing General Manager Brian Cashman to continue talking with the Cubs about Sammy Sosa and with Detroit about Juan Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>''We had that inner conceit and knew that we were good,'' Torre said. ''Have people come and get us. People have come and gotten us. That doesn't mean it's a long-range predicament. It's something we have to fight our way through.''</p>
        <p>Embarrassed. It is not a word that has been associated with these Yankees too often, and they dumped it on the Red Sox last night. But the standings in the American League East can be deceiving. The Yankees, first place or not and a 22-1 rout or not, need help. Some changes are looming.</p>
        <p>''Wearing this uniform,'' Torre said, ''I expect anything anytime.''</p>
