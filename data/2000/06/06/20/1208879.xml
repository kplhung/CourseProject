        <p>Even in a city that is used to being looked down on, there has been something particularly galling about the way the French have long regarded Hollywood. That makes it all the more provocative that the latest foreign company to buy a major movie studio has been Vivendi S.A., a French media giant.</p>
        <p>''The French always have been the most irate about American domination of the movies, so to think that now it will be the French who are financing these American movies, well, you'd have to say that's ironic,'' said Peter Bart, editor of Variety.</p>

        <p>Even in a city that is used to being looked down on, there has been something particularly galling about the way the French have long regarded Hollywood. That makes it all the more provocative that the latest foreign company to buy a major movie studio has been Vivendi S.A., a French media giant.</p>
        <p>''The French always have been the most irate about American domination of the movies, so to think that now it will be the French who are financing these American movies, well, you'd have to say that's ironic,'' said Peter Bart, editor of Variety.</p>
        <p>The reality is, though, that it has been a long time since the days when Hollywood was run by a small clique of American moguls. The movie studios were all acquired by larger conglomerates and, in the last decade, the business of making films has become an increasingly global one. Sony owns Columbia. For a time, Credit Lyonnais controlled Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.</p>
        <p>So the news that Universal Studios, one of the earliest movie pioneers, which began making silent shorts before World War I, was being purchased by a French company  has been greeted here with something less than shock.</p>
        <p>''I don't find it ironic at all that a French company has bought Universal,'' said Tom Pollock, who was a top executive at Universal under three owners. ''Canal Plus has built an incredible empire in Europe on the strength of American movies and television.''</p>
        <p>The pay television company, Canal Plus, is 49 percent owned by Vivendi.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pollock and others said that the French business officials they had encountered displayed none of the anti-Hollywood sentiments espoused by some French critics, filmmakers and government officials.  ''Maybe leftist intellectuals in Paris are decrying American films, but the French people are eating them up,'' said one independent producer. ''They can't make our movies, so they'll buy them.''</p>
        <p>Most here expect that Pierre Lescure, the chairman of Canal Plus, will not move his offices to Universal City but remain in Paris. Universal Studios will become one of the corporate divisions under his control. Instead, as in the case of almost all of the other purchases of Hollywood studios by foreign companies, it is anticipated that some established Hollywood insider will be chosen to run the studio under Mr. Lescure. Among the names mentioned was Terry Semel, a former top Warner Brothers executive. Officials at Universal said today that it was not yet a foregone conclusion that the current president, Ron Meyer, would be leaving.</p>
        <p>In the late 1970's and 1980's, when Universal Pictures was owned by MCA, a former talent agency, and run by Lew Wasserman, it was among the most lucrative and powerful studios in Hollywood. Much of its strength was based on the talent of Steven Spielberg, a young filmmaker the studio had discovered and nurtured.</p>
        <p>In 1991, MCA was purchased by a Japanese conglomerate, the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company. The Japanese company, in turn, sold Universal in 1995 to Seagram, whose chairman, Edgar Bronfman Jr., has displayed much more interest in expanding the company's music empire than in the movie business.</p>
        <p>''I ran Universal when it was an American-owned public company, I ran it for five years when it was owned by the Japanese and I ran it for under a year under Edgar Bronfman,'' Mr. Pollock said. ''During the Japanese era, they never made one decision as to what movie got made or didn't get made. They let management in place run the company. I have no idea whether the French will be the same way or not.''</p>
        <p>The betting money is that they will.</p>
        <p>One of the most unfortunate aspects of Canal Plus buying Universal may be that the French company, which has been particularly active in financing American independent films to help feed its television channels, may shift its attention away from small, quality films toward the big, star-studded blockbusters that make up a traditional studio slate.</p>
        <p>''When Sony bought Columbia Pictures, there was all kinds of talk in the American media about, oh, we're selling our culture to foreigners,'' said Mr. Bart, the editor of Variety. ''The interesting thing is that, this time, there's none of that. That's because times have changed. Most people aren't aware of it, but there's been so much in the way of European money flowing into Hollywood in recent years to help finance American movies and it's beginning to affect the kinds of movies that are being made and the way they're cast. They're putting people into movies who are known in Europe.''</p>
