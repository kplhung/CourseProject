        <p>The Seagram empire grew over three generations, rising on liquor and blood and toil from the harsh plains of western Canada to the skyscrapers of New York and the lush boulevards of Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Now with the Seagram Company apparently on the verge of reaching an agreement to sell itself to Vivendi, an upstart French media company hardly known outside Europe, the story of one of the world's largest family-controlled companies is about to come to an end. For the Bronfmans, the Canadian clan that rode from the Prohibition era into dazzling wealth and power, this is a bittersweet day.</p>
        <p>For six years, Edgar Bronfman Jr., third-generation heir to the Seagram throne, has tried to transform Seagram from a stodgy liquor company into a media powerhouse. Along the way, he sold Seagram's stake in DuPont, bought the Universal movie studio and made Seagram the world's biggest music company.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bronfman could never outrun his detractors, who jeered him as an intellectual lightweight whose judgment was clouded by the star-studded atmosphere of Hollywood and the record business. And it was never clear whether Mr. Bronfman had the full support of his uncle Charles R. Bronfman, the co-chairman of Seagram along with Edgar M. Bronfman Sr., Mr. Bronfman's father.</p>
        <p>Last summer, soon after Seagram's stock rallied to what was then a record, Charles Bronfman sold more than $400 million of Seagram shares. Charles attributed the sale to estate planning, but it was hardly a sign of confidence in Seagram's long-term future.</p>
        <p>Other investors are equally skeptical of Mr. Bronfman's abilities. Since he took over Seagram in June 1994, the company's shares have roughly doubled. Over the same period, Time Warner shares have quadrupled, and the Standard &amp; Poor's entertainment industry index, which measures the performance of several big media stocks, has more than tripled. Seagram was lagging even further behind until this month, when its shares ran up on rumors of the Vivendi deal.</p>
        <p>''To my mind, he's done a pretty lousy job as C.E.O.,'' said one institutional investor whose company owns several hundred thousand Seagram shares. Over the period that Mr. Bronfman has run Seagram, ''News Corp., Viacom, Disney, they've all done better,'' said the investor, who said he could not be quoted by name because his company was currently trading Seagram shares.</p>
        <p>But even though Seagram has been outpaced by other media companies, its shares have actually outperformed DuPont since Seagram sold its 328 million shares in the chemical company in spring 1995. Since then, DuPont shares have risen barely 50 percent, less than half Seagram's gain.</p>
        <p>Still, for all his efforts to preserve the family fortune, Mr. Bronfman seemed to be slipping behind as the rest of the media industry consolidated. September's combination of CBS and Viacom, followed by January's titanic takeover of Time Warner by America Online, created a new scale for media companies that Seagram could not match. Seagram has no major United States broadcast television network, no first-rank cable network, no cable systems. Its movie studio has struggled for years, despite occasional hits.</p>
        <p>The music business, meanwhile, is in the midst of a fundamental change driven by the Internet, which has caused music piracy to explode. In the long run, it is not clear whether the Internet will help Seagram and other established music companies by cutting their distribution costs or hurt them by increasing piracy. And until that question is answered, music, which is Seagram's strongest asset, will remain hobbled.</p>
        <p>So with Seagram's stock price stagnating and nagging questions about Mr. Bronfman's abilities, the company turned to Vivendi and the welcoming arms of Jean-Marie Messier. Like Mr. Bronfman, Mr. Messier hopes to recast his company for a new century, turning it from a utility and water company into a communications and media giant. Mr. Messier sees a perfect fit between Seagram's music business and Vivendi's cell phones, a marriage of content and distribution that some analysts agree could give the new company the heft to compete with Viacom and the combined AOL-Time Warner.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Bronfman may have simply been too far ahead of his time. With spending on media and entertainment increasing worldwide, his effort to remake Seagram could well be vindicated in years to come, said Mario Gabelli, whose funds own three million Seagram shares. ''Vertical integration is a necessity,'' said Mr. Gabelli. ''It's a terrific deal.''</p>
        <p>Investors have agreed, at least so far. Over the last week, as word of the deal seeped out, Seagram stock has risen from $50.625 to $63.75, a 26.4 percent gain. For the Bronfmans, who own more than 106 million shares of Seagram stock, the run-up has increased their wealth by $1.4 billion and taken some of the sting out of Seagram's underperformance over the last five years.</p>
        <p>The total value of the Bronfman family stake in Seagram now tops $6.8 billion. The Bronfman stock is held in a complex web of trusts, so unraveling how many shares are held by each individual family member is nearly impossible.</p>
        <p>But whatever the merits of the merger -- and it will take years before investors find out how strong the proposed new company really is -- it is certain that Mr. Bronfman will no longer be in the driver's seat. Mr. Messier will run the new company, with Mr. Bronfman as vice chairman with his actual duties still to be defined.</p>
        <p>That is a condition Mr. Bronfman's grandfather, Samuel Bronfman, would never have accepted, said David Paperny, director of a documentary on the Bronfman family. ''Sam went to great lengths to make sure the company would remain in family hands,'' Mr. Paperny said. ''This included kicking several of his brothers out of the family business so it would be cleanly passed down to his own two sons, Edgar and Charles. Sam would definitely regret seeing the family lose control.''</p>
        <p>Michael R. Marrus, dean of the University of Toronto graduate school and author of a biography of Samuel Bronfman, said ''Mr. Sam,'' as he was known before his death in 1971, ''was someone for whom family mattered hugely.'' Samuel Bronfman would have been especially torn by the news that Vivendi plans to sell Seagram's liquor division after the merger, Mr. Marrus said.</p>
        <p>''The truth is that for Sam, whiskey is not something he made in order to make money,'' Mr. Marrus said. ''He really cared about whiskey, by which I mean he was to blended whiskey what Isaac Stern is to the violin. He really cared.''</p>
        <p>But if he hoped to keep his company independent, Samuel Bronfman made at least one miscalculation. At a family gathering in the 1960's, ''Sam jabbed his finger at Edgar Jr.,'' Mr. Paperny noted, ''and said: 'You're the one. You're the one to lead my company into the future.' ''</p>
