        <p>One of the oddest couples in American politics have divorced.</p>
        <p>Lenora Fulani, whose political views hew as far to the left as Patrick J. Buchanan's do to the right, resigned as co-chairman of his presidential campaign, accusing him of destroying their political partnership by pressing his strong social conservative positions.</p>
        <p>''You shaped your actual campaign -- both inside and outside the party -- to appeal to a narrow constituency in ways that increasingly excluded me, my adherents inside the party and the base to which I relate,'' she said in a letter of resignation delivered on Sunday.</p>
        <p>She added, ''I must and do object to your efforts to transform the party into a party of and for only social conservatives.''</p>
        <p>Her resignation came as little surprise to officials of the Reform Party, many of whom raised an eyebrow, more likely two, when she joined his campaign in November, even though it brought apparent benefits to both.</p>
        <p>After years of operating on the political fringe as standard-bearer and two-time presidential candidate of the now-defunct New Alliance party, she gained a foothold in the nation's strongest alternative to Republicans and Democrats.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Buchanan, who left the Republican party last year to seek the Reform Party's presidential nomination, the alliance allowed him to show that he could broaden the party's base, albeit from unlikely sources -- blacks, Hispanics, gays, even Communists. Ms. Fulani is long-known as a supporter of Marxist-Leninist politics.</p>
        <p>Still, their collaboration underscored certain shared views, including opposition to big government and special interests.</p>
        <p>But in her letter, Ms. Fulani outlined events that convinced her that Mr. Buchanan was not only interested in gaining the Reform nomination but also in projecting broad views on social issues.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fulani also attacked Mr. Buchanan for not supporting Jack Gargan, who was ousted as party chairman, in a meeting four months ago in Nashville. Mr. Gargan was replaced by Pat Choate, Ross Perot's running mate in 1996, who helped pave the way for Mr. Buchanan to join the party. Mr. Choate stepped down last month for personal reasons.</p>
        <p>In a letter of response to Ms. Fulani released by the Buchanan campaign yesterday, Mr. Buchanan said he did not disagree with Ms. Fulani's observations, defending his actions by saying, ''I believe political leaders must defend the moral order rooted in the Old and New Testament and Natural Law that is under relentless assault.''</p>
        <p>Party leaders predicted that Ms. Fulani's departure from the Buchanan camp would have virtually no effect on the party or the November elections, in which the party needs 5 percent of the popular vote to qualify for federal matching funds in 2004.</p>
        <p>''Some people might be upset, but not that many,'' said Gerald R. Moan, the new national chairman, who dismissed Ms. Fulani's complaints as much ado about very little. ''Buchanan doesn't polarize the party any more than she has.''</p>
