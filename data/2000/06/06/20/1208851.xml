        <p>Suddenly, South Koreans are enthralled with all things North Korean.</p>
        <p>Since the two nations vowed to pursue peace and reconciliation last week, sales clerks at the vast Kyobo bookstore in central Seoul have been working overtime to meet an explosive demand here for books about North Korea and Communism.</p>
        <p>Across the street, department stores and fashion outlets have been selling out of sunglasses and drab worker's uniforms similar to those that North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, wore at the talks in Pyongyang with the South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung.</p>
        <p>And at a nearby Samsung consumer electronics store, the company's first color television assembled in North Korea went on sale today to rave reviews.</p>
        <p>Recent public opinion polls show that a majority of South Koreans surveyed now have a good impression of North Korea and its leader after the talks.</p>
        <p>Social commentators here are calling South Korea's new fascination with its estranged northern neighbor an unexpected case of ''Kim Jong Il fever.'' But whatever the diagnosis, the summit meeting last week has forced South Koreans to reassess the decades-old cold war view of North Korea as a mortal enemy.</p>
        <p>''In high school, we were taught that North Koreans were all Communists and therefore very bad and dangerous people,'' Cho Jae Hyung, 17, said as he flipped through titles like ''Will Spring Come to Pyongyang?'' ''A Very Special Leader: Kim Jong Il'' and ''Che Guevara'' at the bookstore.</p>
        <p>''But I saw Kim Jong Il on television, and he seemed like a very modern, practical and intelligent man,'' Mr. Cho said. ''Now, I'm not sure what to believe about North Korea, but I know that what I was told in the past is not exactly the truth.''</p>
        <p>For many South Koreans, especially older people who lived through the Korean War, overcoming a half century of deeply ingrained fear and animosity toward North Korea will not come easy. Many South Koreans were stunned and confused by the abrupt thawing of relations between the two countries, which agreed to cease aggression on the Korean peninsula and forge economic and other ties.</p>
        <p>Especially puzzling for many South Koreans is Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader who they were long told was a reclusive, bellicose dictator. But for many, he came across on television as a warm, gracious and charismatic host during the Pyongyang talks. Many South Koreans remain uncertain whether to embrace North Korea as a long-lost brother or reject it as a charlatan preying on their sensibilities.</p>
        <p>Overhearing a reporter's request to a shopping mall vendor for ''Kim Jong Il'' sunglasses, which have a half tint, Han Choon Ja, a 63-year-old homemaker, became enraged. ''Why would you want to wear the same glasses as that evil man?'' she said. ''He was only putting on a show for the television cameras. We still can't trust him.''</p>
        <p>But Hwang Chang Seok, the sunglasses vendor, told the woman that South Koreans who imitate Mr. Kim's choice of eye wear were helping to reduce the fear and tension between the two countries.</p>
        <p>''One week ago, people considered Kim Jong Il a monster, and now they think his glasses are really cool,'' Mr. Hwang said. ''It might sound funny, but I think that's real progress toward reunification.''</p>
        <p>Still, opposition party leaders have expressed concern that the ''euphoric unification fever'' that is gripping the nation is leading to unrealistic expectations.</p>
        <p>''The most undesirable effect of the inter-Korean summit is that the nation is now seized by a euphoria as if the threat of a war has disappeared and unification is already achieved, while there exist no real changes,'' said Lee Hoi Chang, head of the conservative Grand National Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee said that given the euphoria, South Koreans might start to question the need for the 37,000 American troops that have been stationed in the South since the end of the Korean War in 1953. And indeed such questioning has already started in the aftermath of the summit agreement.</p>
        <p>But for now, it appears that most South Koreans have a favorable opinion of Kim Jong Il. In a survey conducted by the Chosun-Ilbo, a conservative daily, and Gallup Korea, 88 percent of those polled said they had a good impression of the North Korean leader.</p>
        <p>A separate survey conducted by the Korean Broadcasting Institute last week showed that Mr. Kim had a 50.2 percent popularity rating for his political trustworthiness, compared with a 15.1 percent rating just before the summit meeting.</p>
        <p>At Kyobo books, the manager, Cho Jae Hyung, said that after the summit meeting books on North Korea and Communism were in such high demand that the store had to reorder many titles and set up a special section to display them.</p>
        <p>He said people of all ages had expressed interest in the books, which before the summit talks were not very popular but are now among the store's top sellers.</p>
        <p>''I think people are very optimistic about the changes that are occurring in Korea, but they are also a little scared like I am,'' said Lee Kicheol, a graduate student, who was browsing the North Korea section. ''For many of us, this is the first time that we've honestly thought of North Korea as a friend, and we want to read as much as possible about this place and this man.''</p>
        <p>A sales clerk for Samsung consumer electronics, Kang Kyung Hyung, said the store was flooded with customers today inquiring about the company's first television made in North Korea. ''Customers mainly wanted to know if there was a difference in quality between models made in the North or here in the South,'' Mr. Kang said. ''Some people were afraid to buy it, but others were very enthusiastic about purchasing something from the North.''</p>
        <p>''Some people said they were buying a piece of history, while others said they were trying to show their support for North Koreans, who are less fortunate than us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A sign posted above the 20-inch television, which sells for a little less than $200, read, ''In honor of the successful South-North summit meeting, we are pleased to announce the sales of color televisions made in North Korea.''</p>
        <p>Samsung said the North Korean televisions were indistinguishable from models made in South Korea, except for a label on the back that indicates that the device was made in the Daedongkang plant in North Korea.</p>
        <p>Cho Sung In, a Samsung spokeswoman, said that as part of a ''corporate good will'' program to increase economic ties with North Korea, Samsung ships the television parts to North Korea, where it pays a government-owned factory to assemble the sets.</p>
        <p>So far, Samsung, which makes no money on the deal, has received 2,000 North Korean televisions, which were tested in the South to insure quality.</p>
        <p>The company is considering investing as much as $1 billion in a fully integrated consumer electronics plant in North Korea to take advantage of the country's highly skilled, low-cost labor force.</p>
