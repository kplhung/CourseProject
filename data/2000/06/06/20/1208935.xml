        <p>The substance of the Yankees' victory over the Boston Red Sox tonight was the three-layered pitching of Ramiro Mendoza, who stabilized a slumping team, snapped its four-game losing streak and saved the weary bullpen with seven strong innings.</p>
        <p>But the artificial flavoring was added in the last two innings, in the form of 16 runs, and to Yankees fans it had to taste very good: a 22-1 wipeout of the Red Sox at Fenway Park, the largest margin of victory in the history of the rivalry.</p>
        <p>Jimy Williams, the Red Sox manager, tried answering questions afterward, before saying, ''I could keep talking, but it would just be words.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees combined to slug five home runs -- Shane Spencer had a double, a triple and a homer and drove in four runs -- and they received at least one hit, run and run batted in from every spot in the lineup. They turned a yeomen triumph into an offensive feat better suited to 100-yard fields in November.</p>
        <p>One day after a 17-4 pasting by the Chicago White Sox at Yankee Stadium, the Yankees' 21-run margin tonight matched the second-largest victory margin ever for the franchise. On May 24, 1936, they crushed the Philadelphia Athletics, 25-2.</p>
        <p>The Yankees (35-29) regained first place in the American League East, a half-game ahead of the Red Sox (35-30). But it was evident from the shrugs and smirks in the clubhouse afterward that the Yankees chose to not inhale the late-inning frosting; they don't believe they have been transformed back into a championship-caliber team.</p>
        <p>The 22 runs did not correct their starting rotation, which remains in a state of flux. The 22 runs did not suddenly solve their defensive troubles; second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, in fact, was replaced in the seventh inning. The 22 runs means the Yankees have now won only 15 of their last 36 games, and it won't change the fact that the Yankees are pursuing trades for a slugger and a pitcher.</p>
        <p>Twenty-two runs, shortstop Derek Jeter said, means ''nothing.''</p>
        <p>Jeter continued: ''This is one game, in a long season, and you play every day. We got killed yesterday and we did better today. We're not rubber-necking. It's not fun to get beat like that.''</p>
        <p>They scored 22 runs tonight, on 19 hits. On Tuesday, they face Boston's Pedro Martinez for the third time in 23 days; he has an earned run average of 0.99 and has been practically unsolvable for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Mendoza and the Yankees accomplished enough in the first seven innings to feel good about themselves, for a change. The right-hander (6-3) whizzed through the Boston lineup, needing only 33 pitches in the first three innings, getting out of a jam in the second.</p>
        <p>Long before the late binge of runs, the Yankees struggled to score. Spencer tripled to open the third inning and was stranded. Jeter doubled to start the fourth and the next two batters made outs against Boston's Brian Rose.</p>
        <p>But Tino Martinez rolled a single through the middle to drive in the game's first run, and Jorge Posada hammered a two-run homer. Jeter ripped a two-run shot in the fifth, Scott Brosius singled to push home a run in the sixth, and Jeter caught a soft liner and tagged out a runner with the bases loaded to kill a Boston rally in the bottom of the sixth.</p>
        <p>Some of the Yankees on the bench, other than catcher Chris Turner, had chewed on Red Hot candy in the early innings -- the first time they had done so in a couple of weeks -- and it seemed to be working.</p>
        <p>Turner saved his candy until the eighth, for no particular reason. The Yankees started collecting lots and lots and lots of hits, against Boston's Rob Stanifer. Posada singled, and Nomar Garciaparra booted a double-play grounder. A walk, a double by Clay Bellinger to drive home two runs., then an error by the third baseman Wilton Veras.</p>
        <p>The Fenway fans booed. Paul O'Neill singled, and so did Bernie Williams, and Spencer ripped a three-run homer. Stanifer was finally relieved, with two out.</p>
        <p>The Yankees sent 13 batters to the plate, scored nine runs in the inning and led 15-1. Stanifer was demoted to Class AAA after the game.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, made changes. Felix Jose went to right field. Bellinger went to first base. Carlos Delgado was inserted as the second baseman. Turner remained on the bench, chewing his red hots. Mendoza sat in the clubhouse, a pack of ice on his shoulder, astounded.</p>
        <p>Tim Wakefield got the last out of the eighth for the Red Sox, but the ninth inning proved to be a lot more difficult. Jose blasted his first home run in the majors since Aug. 9, 1994, for two runs. Torre sat on the bench, shaking his head. The stream of fans flowing out of Fenway stopped, the rubber-neckers remaining.</p>
        <p>Williams singled. Delgado walked. Ricky Ledee ripped a single off the wall to drive in a run. On and on. Brosius hammered a three-run shot, extending the Yankees' lead from 18 runs to 22-1.</p>
        <p>Torre made more changes, moving Posada to first base, Bellinger to center field -- his third position in three innings -- and Turner was inserted to catch the bottom of the ninth.</p>
        <p>''What, does it take, a 20-run lead before I get in the game?'' he joked with a couple of the Yankees' coaches.</p>
        <p>It was the most runs the Yankees scored since Aug. 12, 1953, when they beat the Washington Senators, 22-1. The nine runs in the eighth inning were their most since Aug. 4, 1998, when they scored nine runs in the ninth against Oakland. They are the first major league team to score 22 runs since the Cincinnati Reds last  Sept. 4. And it was the worst loss ever for the Red Sox in Boston, and the second-worst loss in Boston history; they lost by 24 runs to Cleveland on July 7, 1923.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees face Martinez on Tuesday. If Andy Pettitte pitches well Tuesday, Torre said afterward, if David Cone pitches well on Wednesday, then that will be substance.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we can get something rolling,'' he said.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>CHUCK KNOBLAUCH has 13 errors, nine of them throwing, and Monday night he played his first game on the road since his three-error game at Yankee Stadium. JOE TORRE figured that fans of the Red Sox would be jeering the second baseman. ''I'm sure they'll have their fun,'' Torre said. ''Hopefully, he won't make it as fun for them as they'd like.'' Knoblauch was replaced after six innings, in what figures to become a regular move whenever the Yankees get a late-inning lead. . . . Boston made a flurry of moves before the game, placing the pitcher JEFF FASSERO and outfielder TROY O'LEARY on the disabled list -- O'Leary for personal problems.</p>
