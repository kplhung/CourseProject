        <p>New Jersey is going to have to raise the state gas tax by at least a nickel to pay for $3.7 billion in road and public transportation projects over the next four years, a study by a liberal policy organization predicted today.</p>
        <p>The spending analysis commissioned by New Jersey Policy Perspective criticized two bills by state Republican legislative leaders to siphon money from general revenues while continuing to borrow heavily to pay for the projects. The legislative  plan would provide about $950 million a year for the next four years to pay for roads, bridges and public transportation. Of that about $2.2 billion would be borrowed, and $1.2 billion would come from tax revenues. The remaining costs would go to repaying debts.</p>

        <p>New Jersey is going to have to raise the state gas tax by at least a nickel to pay for $3.7 billion in road and public transportation projects over the next four years, a study by a liberal policy organization predicted today.</p>
        <p>The spending analysis commissioned by New Jersey Policy Perspective criticized two bills by state Republican legislative leaders to siphon money from general revenues while continuing to borrow heavily to pay for the projects. The legislative  plan would provide about $950 million a year for the next four years to pay for roads, bridges and public transportation. Of that about $2.2 billion would be borrowed, and $1.2 billion would come from tax revenues. The remaining costs would go to repaying debts.</p>
        <p>When the Transportation Trust Fund was created in 1984, it was intended to be paid entirely by a portion of the gasoline tax. But expenditures for popular projects have outrun income, particularly in recession years, and the state has increasingly become dependent on borrowing to keep the books balanced.</p>
        <p>And because a borrowed dollar costs more than a dollar to repay, the study maintains, the state would be faced with a need to raise still more money, most likely in the form of a gas tax increase, when the debt bills fall due. The current state gas tax is 10.5 cents a gallon, the fourth lowest in the country.</p>
        <p>Martin E. Robins, director of the Transportation Policy Institute at Rutgers University, said, ''The annual interest payments on the bonds these two bills would authorize would grow within a few years to the point where debt service would consume a substantial portion of money that otherwise would go for transportation projects.''</p>
        <p>Jon Shure, president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, said he would prefer that the Legislature adopt the one-year financing bill for the trust fund that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman proposed this year. That would allow the Legislature to come back with a plan less dependent on debt after next year's vote for governor. After the election, discussion of taxes would presumably be less dangerous for the measure's main sponsors, the Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, and the Assembly speaker, Jack Collins.</p>
        <p>Rae Hutton, a spokeswoman for Mr. DiFrancesco, said that while the proposed financing solution continues borrowing, it would be at a lower rate -- $650 million a year for the next four years, instead of at the current rate of $900 million. ''There is no support for a gasoline tax increase'' as an alternative, she said.</p>
        <p>The bill proposed by Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Collins would also shift $1.2 billion of revenues from petroleum products and new car tax receipts from the general fund to the transportation fund.</p>
        <p>The combined measure was debated today before the Assembly Transportation Committee and will be taken up again on Thursday.</p>
