        <p>It was a classic Dale Earnhardt maneuver, the kind that earned him the nickname Iron Head and, after 75 career victories in the last two decades, the title of King of the Car Fights. Stalk and harass. Drop to pass. Then bump and run.</p>
        <p>The difference today in the Pocono 500 was that the tactics were turned on Iron Head by a young driver Earnhardt had long treated as softhearted: Jeremy Mayfield.</p>
        <p>Less than a half-mile from the checkered flag, coming out of the final turn, Mayfield dropped to the bottom of the track below Earnhardt and kissed the bumper of Earnhardt's No. 3 car, which had led for the previous 14 laps.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Earnhardt's potential 76th victory was whiplashed as Mayfield sneaked his No. 12 car inside for the third triumph of his career, his second at the Pocono Raceway.</p>
        <p>''I never tried to wreck him; I just wanted to rattle his cage,'' said the 31-year-old Mayfield, who won the 500 here in 1998. ''I'm not sure I hit him. If there was contact, it wasn't enough to turn him.''</p>
        <p>Earnhardt made it clear that there was indeed contact and that he did not enjoy being on the receiving end of it. Beyond the finish line, after his car wobbled enough to let Dale Jarrett and Ricky Rudd pass for second and third place, Earnhardt pulled alongside Mayfield.</p>
        <p>In the most terse terms, the man also known as the Intimidator gestured to Mayfield. Later, he said facetiously he was telling Mayfield that he was No. 1. ''I got in a corner, got rubbed a little and got beat,'' said Earnhardt, who finished fourth. ''It was good racing.''</p>
        <p>Mayfield's racing colleagues, however, were amused that the young driver, whom Earnhardt bumped on the track during six years together on the Nascar circuit and razzed often in the garage area, had turned the tables. They gave Mayfield the thumbs-up and chuckled as he made his way to victory lane.</p>
        <p>''We know Dale wouldn't have done that if he was behind him,'' Jarrett said with a sly smile.</p>
        <p>Jarrett, who had positioned his No. 88 car in third place during the final laps, had the best view of the impending tussle. He was also ready to take advantage of it. Jarrett noticed Mayfield gathering steam on the second of the track's three turns at the same time Earnhardt was losing power.</p>
        <p>''I thought this might get interesting,'' said Jarrett, who is third in the Winston Cup point standing behind Bobby Labonte and Earnhardt. ''A lot of times when you get together and get the air taken off the front of your car, like Jeremy did, a lot of times that car will slide up, too. For that split second, I thought I might have a chance.''</p>
        <p>Jarrett added: ''It means a lot to Jeremy. It shows he's a hard racer. The best driver in this business, and he's been that for a long time, is Dale Earnhardt. You go up against him and come out on top. You've got to take advantage of those chances because more times than not you're not going to come out on top.''</p>
        <p>Mayfield had to wait a day for his opportunity after persistent rain and dense fog on Sunday postponed the race until today.</p>
        <p>Mayfield had seven top-10 finishes in 15 races this season, including a victory in the California 500. But he started in the No. 22 position at 10 a.m. today under overcast skies with the temperature at 65 degrees before a depleted crowd, as many people had to get back to work.</p>
        <p>He led for three laps -- 23 to 26 -- but was not confident of a top-10 finish after running 41st last week in Michigan. But Mayfield was running a strong second in the last 20 laps and was intent on stalking Earnhardt when the field came out of the fifth yellow flag on Lap 187.</p>
        <p>He opted for only two new tires on the final pit stop and decided to nurse them until the final lap. Mayfield said he noticed Earnhardt sliding on the final two turns, and he also acknowledged that the Intimidator had intimidated him in races past.</p>
        <p>''But I also was smart enough to know not to try to get him loose on Turn 1 or he'd come back and get me loose,'' Mayfield said. ''A lot of people talk about Dale Earnhardt; he came the hard way and drives that way. So did I.''</p>
        <p>Of the bump-and-run victory, Mayfield shrugged and said, ''You got to do what you got to do to win.''</p>
        <p>Of the likelihood Earnhardt will remember that in a future race, Mayfield showed a little hardheadedness. ''If he comes back to get me,'' he said. ''then I'll go back and get him again.''</p>
