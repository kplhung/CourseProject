        <p>Michael Kaiser, the American theater manager who helped rescue London's Royal Opera House from the financial crisis and internal feuding that plagued its recent $360 million redevelopment, announced yesterday that he would step down at the end of the 2000-2001 season after just 18 months as chief executive of the Covent Garden complex.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaiser, a former executive director of American Ballet Theater, said in a statement that the decision had been ''the most profoundly difficult'' of his career. ''But, for personal reasons, it is time for me to return to my home'' in New York, he said. Mr. Kaiser, who is 47, said he was announcing his intention now to allow time for an orderly transition.</p>

        <p>Michael Kaiser, the American theater manager who helped rescue London's Royal Opera House from the financial crisis and internal feuding that plagued its recent $360 million redevelopment, announced yesterday that he would step down at the end of the 2000-2001 season after just 18 months as chief executive of the Covent Garden complex.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaiser, a former executive director of American Ballet Theater, said in a statement that the decision had been ''the most profoundly difficult'' of his career. ''But, for personal reasons, it is time for me to return to my home'' in New York, he said. Mr. Kaiser, who is 47, said he was announcing his intention now to allow time for an orderly transition.</p>
        <p>Although he had no fixed-term contract, he predicted in an interview early last year that he would need three to five years to have the Royal Opera House operating without financial restraints. He also expressed excitement over the challenge of bringing order to a legendary theater that had known three board chairmen and three directors in as many years, even pointing to a newspaper headline that greeted him  his first day at work: ''Chaos Reigns as Kaiser Enters Opera House.''</p>
        <p>By the time Covent Garden reopened last December after a 30-month makeover, Mr. Kaiser had  virtually eliminated the budget deficit and created a permanent endowment fund. He also had done much to revive morale in both the Royal Ballet and the orchestra and chorus of the opera house after the tabloid-pleasing scandals that preceded him.</p>
        <p>After a yearlong honeymoon with the British press, however, Mr. Kaiser was criticized for pricing seats beyond the reach of many opera lovers and for allowing an independent producer to operate the house during the off-season months of July and August. He also faced embarrassing teething problems with a new computerized stage that forced cancellation of one entire opera production and resulted in several breakdowns during early performances.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the consensus was that, having previously restored financial health to the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and to  American Ballet Theater, he had once again lived up to the nickname of Mr. Turnaround.</p>
        <p>Further, with Anthony Pappano to succeed Bernard Haitink as music director in 2002 and Ross Stretton to succeed Sir Athony Dowell as director of the Royal Ballet next year, an entirely new team seemed to be in place. The first press reports this weekend that Mr. Kaiser was planning to leave Covent Garden therefore came as a surprise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaiser could not be reached for comment beyond his formal statement today.</p>
        <p>In a separate statement, Sir Colin Southgate, the Royal Opera House's board chairman, praised Mr. Kaiser's ''countless'' achievements at Covent Garden. ''He has approached this enormously challenging job with unrelenting energy, commitment and determination,'' the chairman said. ''The Royal Opera House is now on a very sure footing both financially and artistically and we owe him a huge debt of gratitude.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 21, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday in the arts pages about the resignation of Michael Kaiser as chief executive of the Covent Garden complex in London, effective at the end of the 2000-2001 season, misstated how long he will have served in the post. It will be 30 months, not 18.</p>
