        <p>Correction of June 17 Big City column on Alan Edelstein, former producer on Michael Moore's television program The Awful Truth</p>
      </abstract>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Because of an editing error, the Big City column on Saturday about Alan Edelstein, a former producer on Michael Moore's television program ''The Awful Truth,'' misstated the date that Mr. Edelstein was charged with harassing his former employer by following him with a video camera. Mr. Edelstein, who recently sued Mr. Moore for malicious prosecution, was arrested in March of 1999, not this year. (The case was later dismissed.)</p>
