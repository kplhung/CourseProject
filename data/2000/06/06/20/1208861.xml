        <p>After years of directing sanctions and suspicion toward defiant governments from North Korea to Iran, the Clinton administration abruptly declared today that ''rogue nations'' no longer exist.</p>
        <p>There are, instead, ''states of concern.'' They are the very same states as before -- no less dangerous or unpredictable -- but possibly more easily swayed by gentler American terms, officials said.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright disclosed the change in the official lexicon today when she was asked about ''the rogue state'' of North Korea and its ''rogue leader,'' Kim Jong Il.</p>
        <p>''First of all, we are now calling these states 'states of concern,' '' Dr. Albright told a radio interviewer on the same day the administration moved to ease trade restrictions against North Korea, a former battlefield foe that is continuing to develop weapons that may one day be capable of striking the United States.</p>
        <p>Richard Boucher, the department's spokesman, said the shift signaled a change in the administration's approach to an unofficial gallery of nations -- from Libya to Cuba -- where internal reforms might best be advanced by a more nuanced American vocabulary.</p>
        <p>''What we see now is a certain evolution'' among the nations formerly known as rogue, Mr. Boucher said. ''Some places that were described that way have embarked upon a more democratic internal life. Others have been willing to address some of the issues that are of primary concern to the United States.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boucher praised such developments as the sweeping victory by reformist candidates in Iran's parliamentary elections in February and Libya's decision to turn over two suspects for trial in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.</p>
        <p>And, most recently, there were the overtures by Kim Jong Il -- first to halt missile testing and, then earlier this month, to stage a summit meeting with his South Korean counterpart, Kim Dae Jung -- that sent American officials reaching for the thesaurus.</p>
        <p>''If we see a development that we think is in the U.S. interest, we will respond,'' said Mr. Boucher, who went on to trip over his own new terms. ''If we see states of concern that continue to be of concern because they are not willing to deal with some of the issues we are concerned about -- whew.''</p>
        <p>Richard N. Haass, the director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution, said the administration limited its options by referring to rogue nations. The term is often applied to the seven countries listed by State Department as sponsoring terrorism: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.</p>
        <p>''It seemed willy-nilly to lead to a sanctions-dominated foreign policy, when the evidence suggested that sanctions are rarely effective,'' Dr. Haass said.</p>
