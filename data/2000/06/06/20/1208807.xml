        <p>Several studies have found that medical diagnoses and treatments are often different depending on whether a patient is black or white.</p>
        <p>Now, researchers at Duke University believe that they have found evidence that the attitudes that affect the behavior of doctors can be seen in the earliest stages of a student's medical school experience.</p>
        <p>Reporting in a recent issue of The American Journal of Medicine, the researchers said racial and sexual bias surfaced when first- and second-year students were asked to assess the conditions a black woman and a white man who they believed were real patients. In fact, the two were actors using identical scripts.</p>
        <p>With the information provided, the medical students should have been able to diagnose a condition of angina in both ''patients.'' Instead, the white students, who made up 86 percent of the 164 participants in the study, were more likely to diagnosis angina in the white patient than in the black one. And they were more likely to rate the white patient's overall health as ''good.'' By contrast, the minority students in the study made similar evaluations of the two patients.</p>
        <p>''The question is,'' Dr. Kevin Schulman, the lead author of the study, said, ''Is that behavior that people bring with them to medical school? Or is this something we're teaching medical students?''</p>
        <p>If students arrive with biases, he said, then medical schools need to teach them about the pitfalls of making racial assumptions.</p>
