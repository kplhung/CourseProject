        <p>MANHATTAN: CHURCH RESTORATION  The New York Landmarks Conservancy program is expanding its program to restore landmark churches, with the help of a $1 million grant by Robert W. Wilson, a financier, philanthropist and chairman emeritus of the New York City Opera. The conservancy will give priority to churches in New York State that need large-scale construction like steeples and stained-glass windows. Mr. Wilson's grant is to be matched by other benefactors. The group now spends around $118,000 annually on church restoration and, with Mr. Wilson's grant, plans to spend at least an additional $200,000.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: 911 TAPE HEARD AT TRIAL  Prosecutors played a recording of a 911 call made by the distraught boyfriend of Hyeseung Lynda Hong, 26, who was found dead in her Manhattan apartment in 1998, at the murder trial of Ms. Hong's ex-boyfriend, Edmund Ko. ''I see blood on the carpet, and I haven't touched her, and she's lying there on the ground,'' Christopher Lee said on the tape. Some jury members seemed tearful, while Ms. Hong's mother and sister wept openly.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: FORT TOTTEN SOIL TESTS  The Army Corps of Engineers plans to take soil samples at a former Queens military base beginning Monday. The tests, which will take two weeks, are being carried out to detect poisonous mercury and other substances at Fort Totten in Queens, where automobiles and trucks were maintained, said the project manager, David Brouwer of the Army Corps of Engineers. Findings from the tests will determine if cleanup is necessary, although tests from 1998 suggested it was not.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: LABOR OFFICIAL DIES  Jean DeBow, 51, one of three statewide vice presidents of the New York State Public Employees Federation, was a passenger early Saturday morning in a car driven by her friend Dollie Williams, a member of the federations' executive board, when another car struck theirs. Ms. DeBow was killed; Ms. Williams was treated for minor injuries.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: RABIES CASES  The incidence of animals infected with rabies has dropped to stable levels for the first time since a raccoon rabies outbreak began a decade ago. The rabies wave worked its way from Florida to New York in 1990. The epidemic peaked in 1993, when raccoons made up most of the nearly 2,750 cases of confirmed animal rabies in the state, health officials said. That total set a national record for the number of cases in a single year. The state average now fluctuates between 1,000 and 1,500 cases annually.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: FINALISTS FOR COIN  Five possible designs for New York's commemorative quarter have been approved in Washington, and the final selection is now up to Gov. George Pataki. The governor announced yesterday that the winning design would be on New York's quarter in January 2001. The candidates are: the Statue of Liberty against a state outline; the Statue of Liberty against a New York City skyline; Henry Hudson's tall-masted ship sailing up what is now the Hudson river; Gen. John Burgoyne's surrender to the colonial army; the Federal Building in New York City, the nation's first capital.</p>

        <p>BUFFALO: POLICE CHIEF SENTENCED  A former Albion police chief was sentenced yesterday to 16 months in prison for stealing $25,500 in village funds earmarked for drug-fighting efforts. James Proietty, 40, was sentenced in federal court, where he pleaded guilty in January to a charge of misappropriating funds. He said at the time that child-support payments had left him ''financially strapped.''</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: WIDER BEACH ACCESS  Representative Ernest Newton, a Democrat of Bridgeport, wants the state environmental agency to use a court ruling to help open up the beaches along the Connecticut shoreline to all state residents. Mr. Newton has sent a letter to the Department of Environmental Protection citing the state Appellate Court's decision striking down Greenwich's residents-only beach policy. But Deputy Commissioner Jane Stahl said that the D.E.P. had no authority over municipally owned parks and that it would be ''premature'' to discuss any policy changes until the Supreme Court ruled.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: LAG IN CHARITY  Connecticut ranks first in the country for per capita income, but 30th for the percentage of income given to charity, according to 1997 tax figures, the latest available. The Connecticut Council for Philanthropy, a regional association of grant makers, has been waging a campaign to promote increased donations. The council president, Nancy Roberts, said that a general lag in giving was common in New England.</p>

        <p>FARMINGTON: BLOOD CRISIS NEAR  The American Red Cross says a shortage of blood is reaching a crisis point in Connecticut, forcing the agency to restrict the amount of blood distributed to hospitals. The Red Cross advised 33 hospitals in the state on Friday that distribution of five types of blood was being restricted. The agency is recovering from a monthlong strike by state blood collection workers that reduced the number of daily blood drives from as many as 12 to only 1. The strike ended on June 3.</p>

        <p>MARLBORO: CAR-PHONE CURB  Marlboro may restrict the use of cellular phones in automobiles under a local ordinance to be introduced Thursday night. A Marlboro Township councilman, Barry Denkensohn, is sponsoring the law because studies show that cell-phone use while driving may be as dangerous as driving while drunk. ''Hands-free phone use,'' in which drivers talk into a speaker instead of holding a handset, would still be permitted. Fines could exceed $50. But Michael Pane, an expert in municipal law, said it was unclear whether Marlboro had the authority to regulate driving, which is usually left to state authorities.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: HOSPITAL SETTLES SUIT  A hospital in Trenton has agreed to pay $449,601 to settle government claims that it overcharged Medicare from 1992 to 1998, the United States attorney's office announced yesterday. Authorities charged that Capital Health System's Mercer Campus, formerly known as the Mercer Medical Center, received higher reimbursements by improperly submitting inpatient claims for outpatients. Although it settled the case, Capital Health has denied improper billing.</p>
