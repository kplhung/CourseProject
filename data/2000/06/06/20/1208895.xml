        <p>Seagram Set to Announce An Acquisition by Vivendi  Seagram plans to announce today that it has agreed to be acquired for about $34 billion in stock by Vivendi, the French water utility that is transforming itself into a telecommunications and entertainment giant.</p>
        <p>The sale amounts to one of the largest media deals ever and ends the Bronfman family's control over Seagram, which Samuel Bronfman took over in 1928. Vivendi hopes to tap into Seagram's library of films and music and distribute them over its mobile telephone network in France and through its Internet portal and pay-television company.

        <p>I.B.M. Builds Tiny Spacious Drive  Plunging deeply into the world of pocket-sized personal computing, I.B.M. will introduce a version of its tiny microdrive hard drive with a storage capacity of a billion bytes of information. The new drive, which is the size of a book of matches, is a milestone in the evolution of magnetic storage, executives said, because it surpasses the same one-gigabyte barrier the company's original refrigerator-sized 3380 hard drive surmounted in 1980's. Shares of I.B.M. rose $6.375, to $120.125. [C5.]</p>
        <p>F.T.C. Clears Pfizer-Warner Deal  The Federal Trade Commission cleared Pfizer's $90.2 billion acquisition of Warner-Lambert after the companies agreed to divest drugs for depression and Alzheimer's disease.

The Dow rose 108.54 points, or 1 percent, to 10,557.84, while the Nasdaq advanced 129.27 points, or 3.4 percent, to 3,989.83. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index also climbed, up 21.54 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,486.00. [C14.]</p>
        <p>Cendant Says Ernst Knew of Fraud  Cendant contended in a court filing that the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young knew of widespread fraud at CUC International, a predecessor to Cendant, by 1997 and chose to help the fraud along rather than expose it. Ernst &amp; Young immediately responded by attributing the fraud in part to Cendant's current chief executive, Henry R. Silverman. [C5.]</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T in $3.3 Billion Wireless Deal  AT&amp;T agreed to pay $3.3 billion in cash for wireless telephone systems in Houston, San Diego and San Francisco to expand its wireless telecommunications business. [C15.]</p>
        <p>A Nasdaq Sibling Opens in Japan  The Japanese offshoot of Nasdaq began trading eight stocks in a technically smooth but low-volume start in the first attempt by a stock exchange to go global. ''It's going to take a bit of time to really unfold in its full form, but it's going to succeed,'' said Frank Zarb, chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the Nasdaq market in the United States.

        <p>State Law on Myanmar Struck Down  Making an excursion into foreign policy, the Supreme Court struck down a Massachusetts law aimed at boycotting companies that do business in Myanmar, formerly Burma. [A23.]</p>
        <p>The ruling was a victory for the oil company Unocal, which has been courting controversy by doing business in Myanmar. [A23.]</p>
        <p>Schedule Set in Microsoft Appeal  A federal appeals court dismissed a government argument that it lacked jurisdiction in the Microsoft antitrust case and set a fast-paced schedule for reviewing Microsoft's request that the judges block a lower-court order restricting its conduct. But if the trial judge asks the Supreme Court to take the case directly, the schedule would be suspended. [C2.]</p>
