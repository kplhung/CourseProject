        <p>Gov. George W. Bush used part of a Western campaign swing today to discuss what modern technology could do for public education. But there was also a lesson in what that technology -- or at least its wealthy purveyors -- could do for Mr. Bush and fellow Republicans.</p>

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush used part of a Western campaign swing today to discuss what modern technology could do for public education. But there was also a lesson in what that technology -- or at least its wealthy purveyors -- could do for Mr. Bush and fellow Republicans.</p>
        <p>At a dinner tonight at the home of John T. Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, Mr. Bush collected what campaign officials estimated to be more than $3.5 million from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Much of it was ''soft money,'' largely unregulated donations to political parties, and all of it was to be divided between the Republican Party in California and the Republican National Committee.</p>
        <p>''I don't relish these big fund-raising events,'' Mr. Bush said beforehand, as his campaign plane flew west from Austin, Tex. But he was set to grin and bear several of them in a campaign week expected to be among his most lucrative.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's schedule included a dinner in Los Angeles on Tuesday expected to raise $2 million for the state and national parties and a gathering in Houston on Wednesday night expected to raise at least $4 million for the national committee.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Bush's other purposes as he traveled to Vancouver, Wash., and then to Palo Alto was to promote some new proposals he said were intended to make sure that technology brought into public schools was truly helping students learn.</p>
        <p>He was also spending time in two states he would like to make more competitive in the election than political analysts had predicted he could.</p>
        <p>Speaking at an elementary school in Vancouver, Mr. Bush said the Clinton administration's efforts to wire classrooms to the Internet -- it is spending about $3 billion annually on the project -- had given local school districts too little flexibility in their use of the funds, creating a system ''hidebound by regulations.''</p>
        <p>He called for loosening those regulations and for another $80 million a year in federal financing so that the Department of Education could study the best ways of using technology in classrooms and make the information available to states and local districts.</p>
        <p>''The goal ought not to be how many classrooms are wired,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The goal is how are we effectively teaching children.''</p>
        <p>Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, countered that in addition to the $3 billion, there was roughly $500 million more now in the federal budget over which states and local districts had ample discretion and could be applied to provide teacher training, software purchases and other steps to make best use of schools' Internet access.</p>
        <p>''It's been very successful,'' Mr. Hattaway said, adding that Mr. Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has set a goal for his administration to assure that every American student was computer-literate by the eighth grade.</p>
        <p>The campaigns' jousting today also touched on Social Security.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has proposed allowing workers to invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market. Mr. Gore, who has called that idea risky, is expected to announce a plan on Tuesday to help lower- and middle-income Americans invest in the market, augmenting their Social Security benefits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush today called this a validation of his own approach. ''My opponent changes a lot,'' he said. ''At first the stock market was 'roulette' and 'risky.' And now that the heat's on, he changes his position.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hattaway said Mr. Bush was missing the point.</p>
        <p>''Gore's plan does not involve Social Security funds,'' Mr. Hattaway said. ''He is proposing a new savings plan separate from Social Security that would protect the guaranteed benefit of Social Security while letting people build up a nest egg.''</p>
        <p>Under the Gore program, the federal government would provide as much as a 3-to-1 match, up to $1,500 a year, for money that lower- and middle-income Americans put into tax-free retirement accounts, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was also reminded repeatedly today about the scheduled execution on Thursday of Gary Graham, a convicted killer in Texas. Scores of death-penalty protesters stood in front of a hotel here where Mr. Bush held a small fund-raiser before the Chambers dinner, and his remarks at the event were interrupted by two protesters who had gained entry to the banquet room.</p>
