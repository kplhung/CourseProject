        <p>Re ''Assad's Son Gets Syrian Party's Blessing'' (news article, June 18): Jews in Syria have been held hostage in the three decades since Hafez al-Assad seized power. Every time there was an Israeli military victory, young Jewish women were killed or raped.</p>
        <p>Syrian Jews are not free to emigrate to Israel or the United States and have already had most of their property expropriated by the Syrian  government. Mr. Assad's reign was one of terror and intimidation and animus toward Israel and his own citizens.</p>

        <p>Re ''Assad's Son Gets Syrian Party's Blessing'' (news article, June 18): Jews in Syria have been held hostage in the three decades since Hafez al-Assad seized power. Every time there was an Israeli military victory, young Jewish women were killed or raped.</p>
        <p>Syrian Jews are not free to emigrate to Israel or the United States and have already had most of their property expropriated by the Syrian  government. Mr. Assad's reign was one of terror and intimidation and animus toward Israel and his own citizens.</p>
        <p>I call on his son, Bashar al-Assad, to release all the Jews in Syria who wish to leave and to return to them the wealth and property that was confiscated because they were Jews. Jews have lived in that area for 2,000 years and are once again being condemned for their religious beliefs.</p>
