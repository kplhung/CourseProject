        <p>Prosecutors in Atlanta dismissed murder charges against Ray Lewis, the Baltimore Ravens' all-pro linebacker. Instead, Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of obstruction of justice -- the result of his misleading statements to the police -- and accepted a sentence of 12 months of probation. Mr. Lewis, 25, had been charged, along with two friends, in the stabbing deaths of two men during a street brawl outside a nightclub on the night of the Super Bowl in Atlanta in January. The trial of the co-defendants is continuing.</p>
