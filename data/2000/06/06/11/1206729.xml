        <p>E-ZPass will not be available on every lane of the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway, as originally planned. Last week the Turnpike Authority, which is in charge of E-ZPass installation in the state, announced that 60 lanes on the turnpike and 40 lanes on the parkway will never get E-Z Pass capability, because of escalating costs. The first phase of the work, which will place E-ZPass on 163 of the parkway's 344 lanes and 160 of the turnpike's lanes, is set to be finished in September, pushed back from this month. The remainder of the lanes -- 141 more on the parkway and 119 more on the turnpike -- are to be operating by June 2001.</p>
