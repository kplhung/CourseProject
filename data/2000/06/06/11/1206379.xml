        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your May 21 article ''Keeping Deadly Gas Out of Home'' has a great deal of useful information regarding the carbon monoxide danger. Great incentives for insulating and sealing residences have tended to aggravate as well as conceal this problem.</p>
        <p>For many years buildings were ventilated through leaky doors and windows. In the zeal for energy conservation, leaks have been carefully closed, creating a perilous situation that is often overlooked.</p>

        <p>Your May 21 article ''Keeping Deadly Gas Out of Home'' has a great deal of useful information regarding the carbon monoxide danger. Great incentives for insulating and sealing residences have tended to aggravate as well as conceal this problem.</p>
        <p>For many years buildings were ventilated through leaky doors and windows. In the zeal for energy conservation, leaks have been carefully closed, creating a perilous situation that is often overlooked.</p>
        <p>Simply leaving an exterior door or window near the furnace or heater unsealed as a secondary form of ventilation will remove much of the problem. In addition, permanently venting the furnace area and the heating appliance to the outside should greatly lessen the possibility of poisonous buildup.</p>
