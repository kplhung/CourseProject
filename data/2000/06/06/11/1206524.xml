        <p>Fearful that a string of 100-degree days this summer might result in selected power failures, the Long Island Power Authority is asking commercial customers Island-wide and residential customers on the East End to let the utility to turn off their air-conditioning during periods of peak usage.</p>
        <p>Bert Cunningham, a LIPA spokesman, said commercial customers signing up for the program would receive a $50 credit on their electric bill. Residential customers agreeing to let LIPA remotely turn off their central air-conditioner would receive a $20 coupon for use toward the purchase of any one of 90 items, like light bulbs and lighting fixtures,  from LIPA's EnergyWise catalog.</p>

        <p>Fearful that a string of 100-degree days this summer might result in selected power failures, the Long Island Power Authority is asking commercial customers Island-wide and residential customers on the East End to let the utility to turn off their air-conditioning during periods of peak usage.</p>
        <p>Bert Cunningham, a LIPA spokesman, said commercial customers signing up for the program would receive a $50 credit on their electric bill. Residential customers agreeing to let LIPA remotely turn off their central air-conditioner would receive a $20 coupon for use toward the purchase of any one of 90 items, like light bulbs and lighting fixtures,  from LIPA's EnergyWise catalog.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cunningham said LIPA hoped to sign up 283 homeowners and 150 commercial units for a projected saving of 2.1 megawatts. He said the offer was confined to East End homeowners initially because energy consumption there rose 25 percent last summer, compared with 4 percent on the rest of the Island.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cunningham said that under the LIPA plan, participants would agree to have their air-conditioning compressor, not the fan, turned off for 15 minutes each hour between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. on no more than five non-holiday weekdays.</p>
        <p>Another project announced two weeks ago would give homeowners a $10 or $20 coupon toward the purchase of items from the LIPA catalog if they buy an energy efficient air-conditioner.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Cunningham said LIPA has expanded a program to provide a cash incentive to commercial customers who promise to reduce their power consumption during critical periods. He said 298 commercial customer accounts (including local governments and companies with their own generators) have signed up for a potential saving of 80.4 megawatts of power, 75 percent more power than last year.</p>
