        <p>Look inside the toolbox carried by a crime-scene detective and you might be surprised by what you find: an ordinary lint remover, for picking up hairs and fibers, a jar or two of silicon powder, for making oily fingerprints visible, and maybe a tube of Super Glue, for lifting more stubborn prints. The tools are not only rudimentary; they also can't even be used without contaminating or destroying some of the evidence at a crime scene. Five years ago, the defense team in the O. J. Simpson murder trial wrote the playbook on how to exploit that fact, and police forensic units have been trying to repair their tattered reputations ever since.</p>
        <p>They may have found a solution in outer space. At the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, a handful of scientists are adapting chemical-analysis devices originally developed to decode the makeup of the asteroid Eros by the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft. A team led by the astrophysicist Jacob Trombka is condensing the various technologies into a pencil-size X-ray generator and a shoebox-size detector that will help cops map out the intricate choreography of crimes. The X-rays make gunpowder residue turn fluorescent; the detector then analyzes the relative levels of it throughout a crime scene, and this data can be used to determine where the gunshot came from. Similar techniques can isolate blood splatter (by zeroing in on its high iron content) or detect semen (by keying on zinc) without cops ever laying a glove on the evidence. Just about every substance at a crime scene could be identified and chemically analyzed, then displayed in a three-dimensional digital map. It would take quite a defense lawyer to go up against this.</p>

        <p>Ten years from now, says David Boyd, deputy director of the National Institute of Justice office that guides the NASA Teleforensics Project, the role of men in blue at crime scenes may be substantially reduced. Once a crime is discovered, the area will be immediately cordoned off, Boyd predicts, and forensic specialists will watch from afar while tiny robots, equipped with NASA-developed tools, do most of the work. The next Sherlock Holmes, in other words, could be a machine.</p>
