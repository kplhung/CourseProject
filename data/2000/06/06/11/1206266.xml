        <p>World of Pies</p>
        <p>By Karen Stolz.</p>
        <p>Hyperion, $18.95.</p>
        <p>''World of Pies'' is sweet, and wears its sweetness un-self-consciously. ''My family believed mightily in sugar as solace,'' the narrator, Roxanne, says midway through, an echo of an earlier confession: ''Our family believed ice cream cured anything.'' Both declarations are unnecessary, since this novel-with-recipes lays a heavy emphasis on better communication through cooking. There may be good reasons to include recipes in fiction, but ''World of Pies'' does not have a strong enough presence to carry it off. The book is more or less a coming-of-age story about Roxanne, who lives in Annette, Tex., a friendly Southern town that's ''small enough to know everybody, big enough to pretend we didn't when needed.'' Roxanne is an archetypal tough cookie, bumping from one obstacle to the next (the discovery of sex, of her parents' imperfections, of the lesbianism of an aunt). The writing is loose and anecdotal; there is an appealing Southern slowness here -- certainly not all family stories need to be unhappy ones -- but a nostalgic gloss floods the narrative and keeps the power of the sadder events (a father's death, a mother's sudden hysterectomy) at bay. In such a rosy setting, the recipes seem excessive, and one, ''Doreen's Frozen Fruit Salad,'' sounds dreadful. These recipes are accompanied by notes like ''good for making up with Daddy,'' further pushing this set of vignettes away from the novel it wants to be and toward the memoir that perhaps it is.</p>
