        <p>Alan Jay Lerner, the lyricist and playwright whose Broadway musicals with the composer Frederick Loewe include ''Brigadoon'' (1947), ''Paint Your Wagon'' (1951), ''My Fair Lady'' (1956), ''Camelot'' (1960) and ''Gigi'' (1973), will be honored, along with the composers with whom he collaborated, in ''Carnegie Hall Celebrates Lerner and Loewe and . . .'' on Wednesday and Thursday.

        <p>In this article, Charles Strouse, who wrote the music for ''Golden Boy,''  ''Annie,''  ''Applause'' and ''Bye, Bye Birdie'' and collaborated with Lerner on the show ''Dance a Little Closer'' (1983), reminisces about his friend, who died in 1986 at the age of 67.</p>
        <p>The tribute to Alan Jay Lerner is more than well deserved and timely. My collaborating with him was something like a marriage, and like any wonderful one, much too short. Here then is no tribute, but a few snapshots:</p>
        <p>I first met Alan on a flight from New York to Los Angeles. I'd left my credit cards and money behind and he lent me $40. A few years later, he told an interviewer he'd lent me $90.</p>
        <p>He wore white cotton gloves while writing, he explained, to keep the ink off his hands.</p>
        <p>Alan told me I was foolish to pay all my taxes, that I should keep my money on the Isle of Wight and send my lawyer there to bring back cash in a suitcase when I needed it.</p>
        <p>He said that the night ''Brigadoon'' opened, half the audience didn't return after intermission and he fled to the Algonquin and turned his phone off for a week.</p>
        <p>And that when ''My Fair Lady'' opened in London, his publisher gave him and Fritz Loewe matching Rolls-Royces.</p>
        <p>Alan told me he very much loved each of his wives, but none more than Liz, his last.</p>
        <p>He said that Fritz Loewe's mother chained him to the piano to make him practice when he was a child, so would I mind if he sat with me while I composed because he had gotten into the habit of watching Fritz to see that he didn't try to escape.</p>
        <p>Alan said that no matter how much money he'd made, he'd never have as much as when he was a child. (His father owned Lerner stores.)</p>
        <p>He said he didn't care about good reviews anymore, only that he shouldn't be humiliated.</p>
        <p>He told me he lost his eye while boxing at Yale. That in England, he was often mistaken for Sammy Davis Jr.</p>
        <p>Alan said, ''It's often good to be interesting, but it's always interesting to be good.''</p>
        <p>He said that he kept a chauffeur in New Jersey to walk his dogs since he couldn't bring them to England.</p>
        <p>That extra-sensory perception was a fact.</p>
        <p>That somewhere, somewhere, was an adjective that could more perfectly enhance a word or phrase he was writing. (He wouldn't sleep for weeks in his search for it.)</p>
        <p>Not noticing that I wore a T-shirt and sneakers most of the time, he would tell me I should keep my measurements on file at Turnbull &amp; Asser in London, so I could order shirts any time I needed them. When he knew he was dying of lung cancer, he ordered a dozen shirts.</p>
        <p>The night he died (I wasn't there), he ordered Champagne for all (''the perfect complement to codeine'') in his hospital room.</p>
        <p>I loved him.</p>
