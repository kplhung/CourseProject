        <p>David Cone wore silver sunglasses on the Yankees' bench and reflections from yesterday's 13-5 wipeout of the Mets darted across his oval lenses, all the hits and the home runs of teammates. Only Cone knows what was happening behind the shades, what he was thinking on the eve of one of the most noteworthy starts of his long career.</p>
        <p>The Mets and Yankees have traded one-sided victories the last two days, and tonight Cone, with a record of 1-6, will pitch the decisive game of the series against the Mets' Mike Hampton at a time when there are mounting questions about why Cone is not winning. Cone, whose only victory came April 28, played for the Mets, plays for the Yankees now, understands the city, the fan-based dynamics of the rivalry between the two teams, and will walk into the maelstrom at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>The Mets hammered Roger Clemens Friday, and yesterday, the Yankees did the same to Bobby J. Jones, who surrendered seven runs in four and two-thirds innings. The Yankees' Paul O'Neill and Derek Jeter each had three hits, including solo home runs, and catcher Jorge Posada snapped a 5-5 tie with a monstrous three-run homer in the fifth inning.</p>
        <p>Cone is poised to take a determining role in this series, but he declined comment when a growing crowd of reporters approached his locker after the game. He seems tired of discussing each possible reason for his struggles and reviewing all the solutions he is considering. ''I'm just anxious to get out there and pitch,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Cone needs the distraction; he admitted he has been bogged down in his travails, falling into a period of self-pity in May when he pitched well and could not win. He is 37 years old, his statistics are terrible and the doubts are inevitable, even within Cone himself, even when his arm feels good. Will he regain his sharp-breaking slider, the pitch he needs to combat right-handed batters?</p>
        <p>Cone said he had determined in the last week to forget about all the numbers, ignore the doubts and move on. Manager Joe Torre said tonight's stage should help Cone, because he can focus on the needs of the Yankees. Cone agreed, saying: ''Maybe this is what I need. That is really where I'm trying to get my mind-set to be. I'm just trying to forget about my numbers and think about how to help this team, what really matters.''</p>
        <p>For a few innings yesterday, it appeared Cone might have to save his team from a disastrous Mets sweep. Andy Pettitte pitched poorly early, just as Clemens did Friday night, the latest evidence of their almost spooky symbiosis.</p>
        <p>Clemens is Pettitte's favorite player. Pettitte lives in Texas, near Clemens. In the off-season, he drives 20 minutes daily to work out at Clemens's house. He follows Clemens in the rotation. He even follows Clemens in performance. They pitched back-to-back for the first time May 12-13, and each allowed 10 hits and 6 runs in four and two-thirds innings. In their next two starts, Clemens allowed 8 runs in 11 innings, Pettitte 9 runs in 11 innings. They pitched complete games on May 28 and May 29, respectively. Clemens allowed 6 runs in 5 innings on June 3, Pettitte 6 runs in 6 innings the next day.</p>
        <p>Their improbable parallel lives continued this weekend. Clemens threw 30 pitches in the first inning Friday, Pettitte labored and threw 33 pitches in the first inning yesterday. Pettitte allowed a home run to Robin Ventura in the third inning and the Mets led, 3-2.</p>
        <p>But the mutuality was broken, for one very simple reason: Whereas Al Leiter stifled the Yankees while the Mets trounced Clemens Friday, the Yankees overcame Pettitte's mistakes by bashing Jones yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Mets' right-hander does not throw hard, does not have a nasty breaking ball, and since his shoulder troubles of a year ago his control has been ordinary. The Yankees' batters were taking monstrous hacks at him right away, as if they were in a home run-hitting contest.</p>
        <p>O'Neill swung hard in the first, and when he realized he had lifted a harmless fly to right he pirouetted to his left, angry, feeling as if he should have hammered the ball. With the Mets leading, 3-2, in the bottom of the third, Jones fell behind O'Neill three balls and no strikes; he tried flipping a fastball over the plate and O'Neill destroyed it, the home run tying the score.</p>
        <p>The Mets scored twice in the fifth, taking a 5-3 lead, and should have had another run when Pettitte appeared to balk blatantly with the bases loaded, raising his hands while on the rubber and then calling time. Umpires did not agree with the protest of Mets Manager Bobby Valentine.</p>
        <p>Down by two runs instead of three, the Yankees finished Jones in the bottom of the sixth. O'Neill, who was serving as the designated hitter and taking batting practice between at-bats, slammed a double to score one run, and scored to tie the game at 5-5 when Bernie Williams singled. Pat Mahomes was warming up in the bullpen, but Jones remained to pitch to Tino Martinez. ''I was hoping he'd make a pitch and get through the fifth,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Martinez lined a soft single off the glove of the shortstop Kurt Abbott. First and second, two out. The Mets' pitching coach, Dave Wallace, emerged from the dugout, and when Jones saw him, the pitcher's body rippled with a curse. Jones walked off, looking over his right shoulder to see who would replace him.</p>
        <p>It was Mahomes, a right-hander who ran the count to 3-2 on Posada, until he relented and threw a fastball. Posada murders most fastballs; he murdered this fastball, driving it about six rows into the upper deck, a homer worth three runs. To Yankees fans among the 55,839 at Yankee Stadium, the natural order of the world had been restored. ''That was a lift for us, no question,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>The rest was just overkill, a Jeter home run in the sixth, four runs in the seventh, fans slowly deserting the park on a muggy afternoon, the day passing before David Cone's eyes as he thought one day ahead.</p>
