        <p>PROUST'S WAY</p>
        <p>A Field Guide to ''In Search of Lost Time.''</p>
        <p>By Roger Shattuck.</p>

        <p>In France, the Gallimard publishing house has now done the seemingly impossible: a one-volume paperback of Marcel Proust's '' la Recherche du Temps Perdu.'' At 2,408 pages and three and a half pounds, it's a bit bulky for the beach, or even the lap. But it's there, summoning us to read this strange book more and more recognized as the undisputed masterpiece of the 20th-century novel. Meanwhile, we are awash in Proustiana: two new biographies in English within the past year, with the ''definitive'' biography by Jean-Yves Tadie (published in France in 1996) due out here in August, and a spectrum of other books, from Malcolm Bowie's masterly ''Proust Among the Stars'' to Alain de Botton's easy-listening version in ''How Proust Can Change Your Life.''</p>
        <p>But is Proust being read, for all this? Has our fascination with his life and with a glamorized version of la belle epoque taken the place of reading his formidable work? Proust himself warned us that ''a book is the product of a different self from the one we display in our habits, in society, in our vices,'' and we may be most of all impressed by the discontinuities between the frivolous aesthete, social snob, then sequestered invalid remembered by Proust's contemporaries and the greatness of the work. As Roger Shattuck puts it, Proust ''as author . . . was the product of his work in progress.'' Shattuck, who wants to bring readers to Proust's novel, summons us to the task. ''Forget the cork-lined room and the dallying aesthete,'' he writes in ''Proust's Way.'' ''Proust lived in this world and wrote about it with fervor.''</p>
        <p>Shattuck is mainly concerned to offer uninitiated readers a way into understanding the shape of ''In Search of Lost Time'' (to use the better title that has now gained favor over the old C. K. Scott Moncrieff ''Remembrance of Things Past''), how to go about making sense of its sinuous movement toward the final recognitions of ''Time Regained.'' At his most helpful, he sets up themes and procedures of the narrative, then brings them to bear in the reading of a key passage. He is generally a patient and illuminating guide, with something of the fervor and hortatory rhetoric of the accomplished schoolmaster.</p>
        <p>Shattuck is very good, for instance, in explaining the nature of the double ''I'' of Proustian narration. Henry James warned novelists against the ''terrible fluidity'' of first-person narration. But when Proust abandoned the third person he used in his unstructured youthful autobiographical narrative ''Jean Santeuil'' and began the ''Search,'' he created a new and unusual ''I'' that is both fissured and fused, moving fluidly and sometimes vertiginously between the present of the narrator and the past of ''Marcel,'' building multiple temporal perspectives into a single sentence. The double ''I'' promotes a dramatic narration, and Shattuck effectively conveys the suspense and excitement of reading the ''Search.'' He demonstrates that the recognitions we are led to don't ultimately promote an ideology of art but rather an illumination of life. Again and again, he directs us to the rich social life of the ''Search,'' to its high comedy and to its ultimate high stakes: understanding. Art is, in Proust's term, a ''translation'' of life. Proust's novel -- like all great fiction -- is ultimately cognitive in its nature and its rewards.</p>
        <p>Much of Shattuck's argument will be familiar to readers of his two earlier books on Proust, ''Proust's Binoculars'' (1963) and ''Marcel Proust'' (1974). Indeed, the lion's share of ''Proust's Way'' recycles them, with some reorganization and with some additional material, part of it published as articles in The New York Review of Books and elsewhere. Like Proust himself, Shattuck seems to have been rewriting the same book for a number of years, seeking to find its best form. Unlike Proust, however, he doesn't find much to change in his initial versions, and in fact for me the freshest and most exciting part of ''Proust's Way'' remains the material on optics and vision adapted from ''Proust's Binoculars.''</p>
        <p>Shattuck offers his readers help on editions and translations. He reissues here his previously published call to boycott the 1987 Pleiade edition, edited by Tadie, which he rightly sees as having succumbed to a continuing French mania for ''genetic criticism'': study of all the drafts and discarded versions that went into the creation of a work. Including this material made the Pleiade ''Recherche'' grow from three volumes, 3,500 pages -- in the 1954 edition -- to four volumes, 7,300 pages, in 1987. This is certainly, as Shattuck says, to ''hypertrophize,'' and to risk dissolving a relatively coherent text to the point that a number of critics now claim there simply is no definitive version of the ''Search.'' One can agree with Shattuck here yet demur at his fierce loyalty to the 1954 Pleiade, which was not able to take account of the latest typescript of one part of the novel and went back to a superseded manuscript copy.</p>
        <p>Shattuck's claim that in Tadie's edition ''the author's decisions are now virtually overruled'' is a bit misleading, since for the latter parts of the novel those decisions are very obscure. Death caught up with Proust before he could review and correct much of the material from ''The Captive'' onward. Publication of the last three of the seven parts of the ''Search'' was posthumous, and all versions of them have necessarily involved difficult editorial decisions.</p>
        <p>Shattuck's desire to ''fix'' Proust's text in its 1954 version may be indicative of a more general wish on his part to shut the door of the interpretive shop. It is striking to me that from 1963 and 1974 to 2000 he has had so few second thoughts about Proust that he very often reproduces his earlier ones verbatim. There has been much study of Proust in the meantime, not all of it simply genetic, or trivial -- actually, some of the very best interpretive work on Proust has appeared over the past 30-odd years. Very little of it makes an impact on Shattuck.</p>
        <p>For one thing, our cultural understandings of homosexuality have evolved, making a renewed engagement with this crucial aspect of the ''Search'' seem imperative. (Here, Edmund White's ''Marcel Proust'' of 1999 is a helpful corrective.) Shattuck scarcely mentions the famous scene of sadomasochistic lesbian eroticism witnessed by the young Marcel through a window at Montjouvain -+a scene that prepares the extraordinary reversals of perspective that will come in a series from ''Sodom and Gomorrah'' onward. Homosexuality -- inversion,'' in Proust's term -+is one of the novel's most important devices of perspective, bringing a radical revision of perceptions and valuations. And sexuality of all sorts -- which, again, Shattuck scarcely attends to -- is obsessively at the center of the novel, not, one detects, for what it tells us about love but because it triggers the quest to know. Jealousy in particular -- and in Proust there is no love without jealousy -- motivates the tortured search to know the hidden recesses of the beloved's life, which, as Swann discovers, can turn even the study of railroad timetables into a poetic and novelistic enterprise.</p>
        <p>''Proust's Way'' is a somewhat old-fashioned book, one that wants to recover the shape and unity of the novel it studies, show it all as a seamless web. And this is of course an essential part of the reader's quest. The ideal of the Proustian metaphor -- what he called the necessary link holding together past and present in a moment out of time -- is unforgettably there as the goal revealed in ''Time Regained.'' But we may also be sensitive to the cornucopia of diversion along the way, in a novel that after its start and finish were composed expanded mightily in its middle. Many critics have come to appreciate the ''Search'' as a text that never can be made whole, that should be valued for its sense of constantly becoming, the plurality of its paths and its meanings. If the book that Marcel resolves to write at the end of the ''Search'' will be the novel of truth revealed, the ''Search'' itself is equally the book of error, of wandering, of false leads and byways, of obsessional search. And that, too, we may prize.</p>
