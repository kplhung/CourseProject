        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To Mr. Ratliff's article, I would like to add a note of rebuttal from a jazz musician who has dedicated 45 years of his life in pursuit of the elusive, ephemeral, ''perfect'' jazz solo. The one-to-one communication between musician and listener, the Zen-like feeling of being at one with your instrument and your audience, the spiritual connection to the great jazz masters, can't happen in group improvisation or ensemble playing no matter how powerful.</p>

        <p>It is cynical to suggest that, because the perceived level of soloing is generally not up to a high enough standard of expression, we should abandon, phase out or lessen the emphasis on this essential part of jazz performance. It's dangerous, I think, to buy into the record company marketer's mantra that straight-ahead, uncompromised jazz is an unmarketable commodity. Solos are boring or uninteresting because record companies insist on recording and supporting very young and attractive but underdeveloped musicians. They are not mature enough to project the essence (let alone what we used to call swing) that most people need to hear and feel in improvised jazz.</p>
