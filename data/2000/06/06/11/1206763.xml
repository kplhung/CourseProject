        <p>Terry Mulholland pitched five shutout innings despite a pulled hamstring, and the Atlanta Braves made it two in a row over the Boston Red Sox with a 6-0 victory last night.</p>
        <p>The host Braves broke open the game with four runs in the fourth, including Andres Galarraga's 17th homer and a two-run triple by Walt Weiss.</p>
        <p>Weiss started instead of the rookie Rafael Furcal, who was arrested early yesterday on charges on drunken driving and underage alcohol consumption.</p>
        <p>Furcal, at 19 the youngest player in the majors, later got into the game after Weiss injured his right thumb on a slide. Furcal scored a run and also committed his team-high 13th error.</p>
        <p>Mulholland (6-5) scored Atlanta's first run, leading off the third with a double and coming around to score on Andruw Jones's two-base hit.</p>
        <p>Mulholland apparently pulled his right hamstring on the way around the bases. In the fourth, after throwing a strike to Nomar Garciaparra, the pitcher kneeled over and seemed to be struggling to catch his breath.</p>
        <p>He threw a couple of warm-up pitches, then remained in the game. Garciaparra singled, but Mulholland got out of the inning when Mike Stanley hit into a double play.</p>
        <p>Mulholland batted again in the fourth and pitched the fifth before leaving, having allowed just three hits. The Braves bullpen shut down the Red Sox on two hits the rest of the way, including two scoreless innings by Kerry Ligtenberg.</p>
        <p>MARINERS 5, GIANTS 2: Paul Abbott pitched seven and two-thirds strong innings and doubled in his first career big league at-bat, and Rickey Henderson homered for Seattle.</p>
        <p>Abbott (3-2) gave up one run and four hits while striking out four and walking one, helping the Mariners win in San Francisco for just the second time in seven games. He also scored on a bases-loaded groundout after getting his first major league hit in the third.</p>
        <p>Henderson connected for his fourth homer since joining the Mariners on May 17 following his release by the Mets. He drove an eighth-inning pitch from reliever John Johnstone into the left-field seats to up Seattle's lead.</p>
        <p>Shawn Estes (5-3) kept missing the strike zone and matched his season-high with six walks. He allowed four runs and eight hits in five and two-thirds innings in taking his first loss at Pacific Bell Park after opening 4-0 with an 0.84 earned run average.</p>
        <p>ANGELS 10, DIAMONDBACKS 3: Jarrod Washburn pitched seven strong innings and also recorded his first major league hit and run batted in, for visiting Anaheim.</p>
        <p>Tim Salmon, Garrett Anderson and Benji Gil homered for the Angels. The Diamondbacks have lost six of their last seven.</p>
        <p>Anaheim's Darin Erstad added a two-run double, giving him a major league-leading 100 hits in 61 games. He is the fastest to reach the 100-hit mark since Heinie Manush had 100 hits in 60 games for the 1934 Washington Senators.</p>
        <p>Washburn (2-1) gave up one run and five hits and struck out six. He blanked Arizona until the seventh, when Luis Gonzalez led off with a drive just inside the right-field foul pole for his 16th home run.</p>
        <p>ROCKIES 12, RANGERS 6: Larry Walker hit a three-run homer for his first home run since coming off the disabled list as Colorado won its seventh straight home game.</p>
        <p>Colorado reliever Gabe White hit his first career home run in his 25th career at-bat as the Rockies (33-25) moved eight games over .500 for the first time since May 12, 1997.</p>
        <p>Ivan Rodriguez homered twice and drove in four runs for Texas, which lost its fourth straight.</p>
        <p>Walker, who came off the disabled list on Friday after a stress fracture in his right elbow sidelined him for 30 days, homered with two on in his first at bat, also had a double and three walks.</p>
        <p>PADRES 13, ASTROS 3: Bret Boone hit a grand slam and tied his career high with six R.B.I., and Ruben Rivera also homered as host San Diego snapped its five-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>A night after beating the Padres by 7-6, the Astros reverted to the form they've shown in dropping to the worst record in the majors (22-39). Starter Scott Elarton allowed nine runs in an inning and a third, the shortest outing of his career, and the Astros issued three bases-loaded walks.</p>
        <p>Things got so bad for Houston that infielder Tim Bogar pitched the eighth inning -- and he was the only Astros pitcher to record a 1-2-3 inning. Bogar, making his first major league pitching appearance, pitched four times in the minors.</p>
        <p>DODGERS 7, ATHLETICS 2: Eric Karros tied the Los Angeles career home run record as the Dodgers beat visiting Oakland.</p>
        <p>Kevin Brown (5-2) recorded his third complete game of the season with a seven-hitter.</p>
        <p>Karros's sixth-inning, solo homer was his 17th of the season and 228th of his career, tying Ron Cey's record for Los Angeles.</p>
