        <p>NAME recognition was never cheap, but this year it has become more expensive than ever.</p>
        <p>Spending at a clip of $300,000 a day, an unknown Wall Street multimillionaire introduced himself this spring to the voters of New Jersey. And last week, after investing a record $35 million (nearly all of it his own money), Jon S. Corzine won the Democratic primary for the seat being vacated by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, another multimillionaire who used his personal fortune as a launching pad to the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's victory over former Gov. Jim Florio is the most recent reminder that in America these days, candidates must spend enormous sums -- either their own, or money they have collected -- if they hope to have even a remote chance to be elected to the Congress or the presidency.</p>
        <p>It is nearly impossible for candidates to win armed only with ideas but little or no money.</p>
        <p>''Americans have two choices,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity. ''We can either elect rich, bored multimillionaires or plastic figures, with perpetual smiles on their faces who are bought and paid for by special interests.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company who is worth an estimated $400 million, shattered all spending records for a Senate primary. He spent $141.50 for each of his 247,351 votes, an amount that experts say is extraordinarily high. Mr. Florio spent a meager (by comparison) $2.5 million, or $13.89 a vote. Mr. Florio repeatedly accused Mr. Corzine of trying to ''buy the election'' by spending ''obscene'' sums. But Mr. Corzine defended his expenditures as necessary for a political novice running against a household name like Mr. Florio's.</p>
        <p>''Make no mistake, I want to invest in America,'' Mr. Corzine shouted to the crowd at his primary victory celebration Tuesday night at a hotel ballroom in East Brunswick, N.J. ''That's what this campaign will be about.''</p>
        <p>A Congressional campaign's largest expense is media commercials. Because New Jersey has no widely watched television stations of its own, candidates are forced to advertise on stations in New York City, the nation's most expensive media market, and Philadelphia, the nation's fourth most expensive market.</p>
        <p>To put Mr. Corzine's $35 million war chest in context, he spent nearly as much in his primary bid as the combined total spent in 1998 by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and his challenger, Charles E. Schumer, in their fight for a Senate seat. At the time, it was the most expensive Senate race in New York history, though the record will most likely be broken this year.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Corzine's jaw-dropping spending spree should not come as much of a surprise in a year when Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has already spent a record $73 million to win the Republican presidential nomination and experts estimate that a record $3 billion will be spent on the 2000 presidential and Congressional elections.</p>
        <p>''It's obvious why the regular person doesn't even bother to run,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21 and former president of Common Cause, who helped shape the post-Watergate laws that govern today's campaigns.</p>
        <p>''The gulf between winning well-financed candidates and their underfinanced opponents just continues to grow,'' Mr. Wertheimer said. ''And that gulf greatly narrows the pool of individuals in this country who are prepared to become candidates. Any potential candidate is faced with the huge costs of campaigns, the big advantage your incumbent opponent starts out with in terms of surplus funds and the fact that the only place you can turn to is personal wealth or donors who want something in return.''</p>
        <p>In 1998, 94 incumbents in the House of Representatives ran unopposed, the highest number in 40 years. An additional 114 incumbents ran against challengers who had raised less than $25,000, a study by Common Cause found. For all practical purposes, nearly half of the House races in 1998 involved incumbents who ran unopposed or with no threat of losing. In Florida, 18 of the 23 House incumbents seeking re-election ran unopposed, including 12 Republicans and six Democrats.</p>
        <p>THIS year, strategists say only three dozen highly contested House races are likely, or for less than 10 percent of the 435 seats. They attribute the few competitive races to the extraordinary advantage that the current campaign finance system gives to incumbents, who can raise money with relative ease.</p>
        <p>That leaves only self-financed candidates with the ability to get in the game. Candidates who spend millions of their own money lose more often than they win. In 1994, Michael Huffington poured nearly $30 million -- almost all of it his own money -- into his unsuccessful bid to defeat Dianne Feinstein for a California Senate seat. And Al Checchi, a California airline executive, set the record for any statewide primary when he spent $38 million of his fortune in his failed gubernatorial bid in 1998.</p>
        <p>Rarely do candidates who are outspent by wide margins win. But in Long Island in 1992, Rick Lazio unseated incumbent Representative Thomas J. Downey, even though Mr. Lazio was outspent by a five-to-one margin. Mr. Downey was hurt by Mr. Downey's overdrafts at the House bank.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to judge if Mr. Corzine's victory was attributable more to his $35 million investment or New Jersey voters' disgust with Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase as governor in 1990.</p>
        <p>In the general election, Mr. Corzine will run against Robert D. Franks, a four-term Republican congressman from Union County. In his victory speech last week, Mr. Franks borrowed a line of Mr. Florio's to begin his campaign against Mr. Corzine: ''Good evening, New Jersey, I'm Bob Franks, the candidate with experience that money can't buy.''</p>
        <p>Meantime, Mr. Corzine will continue to add to his record. ''Well,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, ''when you've broken the record for the most spending ever and there's still five months to go until November, you've left the stratosphere and entered the ionosphere.''</p>
