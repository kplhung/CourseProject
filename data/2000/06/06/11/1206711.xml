        <p>The logo for Newark's minor league team is a bear with a baseball in its mouth. On my first trip to see the Newark Bears at Riverfront Stadium, I hoped to find something a bit more appetizing. Stadium food has come a long way from the old standby, a hot dog and a beer. To a traditionalist, diverse delicacies are as unwelcome as the designated hitter. At no point in ''Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' will you hear, ''Buy me some tofu and fish tacos.'' But as baseball competes for America's entertainment dollar, we see more variety, appealing to the appetites of everyone in your family (unless your cousin is the maitre d'hotel at Le Cirque).</p>

        <p>The logo for Newark's minor league team is a bear with a baseball in its mouth. On my first trip to see the Newark Bears at Riverfront Stadium, I hoped to find something a bit more appetizing. Stadium food has come a long way from the old standby, a hot dog and a beer. To a traditionalist, diverse delicacies are as unwelcome as the designated hitter. At no point in ''Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' will you hear, ''Buy me some tofu and fish tacos.'' But as baseball competes for America's entertainment dollar, we see more variety, appealing to the appetites of everyone in your family (unless your cousin is the maitre d'hotel at Le Cirque).</p>
        <p>Multifaceted menus have made it to the minors, as well. At Riverfront's four concession counters and various food stands, you'll find the classics: hot dogs, soda, beer, ice cream, pretzels, and of course, peanuts and Cracker Jack. But you can also get Italian sausage, Philly cheesesteaks, chicken sandwiches, burgers, pizza, nachos, chips, lemonade, and cotton candy. I ordered a chocolate Bosco and a Jabroni. Fans of wrestler the Rock know the word. In this context, though, a Jabroni is two hot dogs, potatoes, peppers, onions, ketchup and mustard, stuffed into a semicircle pizza bread. It's tasty. No item costs more than $5. Combined with a $6 or $8 ticket, a Bears game is one of the state's great bargains. Newark's roster, featuring the siblings of Barry Bonds and Jose Canseco, may make you long for greater players on greater teams. Even the stadium's name -- Riverfront -- calls to mind the glory days of Cincinnati's Big Red Machine. So too, the food here may spark memories of better meals by better chefs. Relax. It's a ballpark. Eat your Jabroni and watch out for foul balls.</p>
