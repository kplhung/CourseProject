        <p>FOR an artist so influential, Anna Halprin is barely known outside her worlds, of dance and, more recently, ritual healing. Yet those who do know her are drawn to her, as proven by the large and enthusiastic audience at her ''80th Year Retrospective'' -- she doesn't turn 80 until July 13 -- last weekend at the Cowell Theater here.</p>
        <p>Many of them, of us, were bearded and/or mumu-wearing, turquoise-laden, white-haired veterans of the 60's, and hence turned the opening concert on June 2 into a kind of nostalgic reunion. What transformed the evening into something more than nostalgia was the unexpected power and charm of the dancing, much of it by Ms. Halprin herself. She proved that a life devoted to a kind of mystic religion of the body, to social healing and confrontations with the Big Questions of life and death, need hardly preclude communicable artistry. And it was her artistry, to which she has newly rededicated herself, that explains the extent of her influence.</p>

        <p>FOR an artist so influential, Anna Halprin is barely known outside her worlds, of dance and, more recently, ritual healing. Yet those who do know her are drawn to her, as proven by the large and enthusiastic audience at her ''80th Year Retrospective'' -- she doesn't turn 80 until July 13 -- last weekend at the Cowell Theater here.</p>
        <p>Many of them, of us, were bearded and/or mumu-wearing, turquoise-laden, white-haired veterans of the 60's, and hence turned the opening concert on June 2 into a kind of nostalgic reunion. What transformed the evening into something more than nostalgia was the unexpected power and charm of the dancing, much of it by Ms. Halprin herself. She proved that a life devoted to a kind of mystic religion of the body, to social healing and confrontations with the Big Questions of life and death, need hardly preclude communicable artistry. And it was her artistry, to which she has newly rededicated herself, that explains the extent of her influence.</p>
        <p>After an Illinois upbringing and a stint of study and performance in New York, Ms. Halprin and her husband, Lawrence, best known as a landscape architect, moved to San Francisco in 1944. They settled on a hillside in Marin County looking over to Mount Tamalpais, across the Golden Gate Bridge from the city, and by the late 50's Ms. Halprin began to break openly with modern-dance orthodoxies.</p>
        <p>Alternating between a San Francisco studio and a redwood deck attached to her home, she offered workshops, classes, performances and communal events that attracted attention far beyond the Bay Area. Merce Cunningham and John Cage, Luciano Berio and Terry Riley and LaMonte Young, Robert Morris and Richard Brautigan and Michael McClure, Yvonne Rainer and Meredith Monk and Trisha Brown and, later, Eiko and Koma all passed through her doors and took away some of her sensuous physicality, restless imagination and openness to ideas. The Judson Church movement and the whole course of experimental dance in New York over the last four decades would not have evolved as they did without her.</p>
        <p>Her most active period of performance and renown in the greater dance world came in the 1960's, with national and international tours of performance pieces like ''Parades and Changes'' (1965) and ''Ceremony of Us'' (1969). They became notorious, at least in prudish America, for their nudity and overt sensuality, but their imagistic boldness is less clearly remembered.</p>
        <p>Even before a desperate battle with cancer in 1972, Ms. Halprin was moving away from performance in the conventional sense. From the 70's to the mid-90's, she concentrated on ''healing,'' as she called it: communal dances of togetherness, dances for AIDS patients, dances to exorcise demons (in one case, a serial killer near her home, who was caught soon after).</p>
        <p>But in the last five years, she has started dancing and choreographing again, and it was the bridge between past and present, between the 60's and the late 90's and into a new millennium, that made up her retrospective -- along with a lobby display of historical photos and a more recent color series by Eeo Stubblefield of a nude Ms. Halprin caked with mud, strewn with leaves and the like.</p>
        <p>The program began with a half-hour excerpt from ''Parades and Changes,'' the most famous part of this originally eveninglong work, which she had first revived at the American Dance Festival in North Carolina in 1997. Here it consisted of 11 young performers dressed in black slacks and white shirts who first ritualistically dress and undress and dress again in slow motion, in different configurations and poses. But the dance takes life when the dancers, now nude, begin rolling and stretching and twisting among strips of brown wrapping paper. The rustling of the paper becomes an amplified roar (the score is by Morton Subotnick), and the dancers and the paper, sometimes torn and hurled into the air, are lighted from the sides in orange or blue; the orange makes the whole writhing array look like fire. It remains as striking a stage image as I have seen, at one with the best of the Living Theater, the Open Theater and early Robert Wilson.</p>
        <p>The rest was all recent. First was a solo piece with Ms. Halprin, short vignettes of narrated recollection and reflection titled ''Memories From My Closet: Four Dance Stories,'' offering evocations of her dance ambitions from age 5 to age 110: a Venetian courtesan, her grandfather from Odessa and her gratitude for the richness of human life.</p>
        <p>And finally came ''Intensive Care, Reflections on Death and Dying,'' for Ms. Halprin and three other dancers, all to a droning, shimmering score by Miguel Frasconi for electronics, glass harmonica and wordless female voice. This was an artistic refraction of Ms. Halprin's quarter-century of work with healing. The dancers, shrouded as in a morgue, grimaced and screamed with fear and agony, then walked acceptingly toward the audience as the curtain fell.</p>
        <p>Like all her work, and the work of many of the artists with whom she has collaborated, these dances could easily be dismissed as New Age California dippiness. ''I'm accused of being touchy-feely,'' she once said. ''Well, I am.''</p>
        <p>But what made these retrospective performances so moving was her ability, enriched by a lifetime of desire and human drama, to refocus her experience back into art. And the power of her choreography was conveyed by the remarkable agility and expressivity of her movements. Like so many older dancers, and like the Asian artists who have exerted such a spell over California, Ms. Halprin achieved many of her effects through the suppleness of her upper body. But she could be as spry as a goat, too, as in her evocation of joyous Odessa dancing.</p>
        <p>At the end, it was cheers and flowers and emotion, which might have been expected had Ms. Halprin merely been gazing back self-indulgently on her past. But she turned out to be very much of the present, as well. So much so that her aspiration still to be dancing at 110 seemed hardly far-fetched at all.</p>
