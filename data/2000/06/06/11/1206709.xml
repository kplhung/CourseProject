        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Which Man's Army'' (front page, June 7):</p>
        <p>I am a former Army logistics captain who left the service last year after seven years. During my career I served mainly in multiracial divisional units.</p>
        <p>The Army fails itself by not admitting a truth: everyone is prejudiced. We all have beliefs that have been shaped by our experiences, or by what the media feed us. What is critical is that we set aside our preconceived notions and judge each person as an individual.</p>
        <p>I truly believe that serving in an organization that gets a large cross-section of the population made me a better, and more educated, person.</p>
        <p>JOHN B. SMITH  Charlotte, N.C., June 9, 2000</p>
