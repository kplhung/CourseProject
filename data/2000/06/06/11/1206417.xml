        <p>THREE years after the state announced a program to increase racial diversity in Connecticut schools, there has been little progress in achieving one of the key goals -- hiring more minority teachers.</p>
        <p>The objective of hiring more black, Latino and Asian teachers came about as part of the state's response to the landmark Sheff v. O'Neill desegregation case of 1996 in which the State Supreme Court ruled that students in Hartford and suburban schools were racially isolated and were therefore being denied equal educational opportunity.</p>
        <p>But four years after the court decision in the Sheff case, figures show there has been little change in a fact of life about Connecticut schools: white teachers do almost all the teaching. In the 1998-1999 school year, the latest year for which figures were available, 6.9 percent of all teachers in the state are minority, including blacks, Latinos, Asians and American Indians, up from 6.3 percent in the 1992-93 school year, according to the State Department of Education. Meanwhile, the number of minority students statewide has risen to 28.5 percent, up from 26.1 percent in 1992-93.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a very serious problem,'' said State Representative Cameron Staples, a Democrat from New Haven and co-chairman of the Legislature's Education Committee. ''Our supply of minority teachers has still not increased, and a number of us feel it is important to do that.''</p>
        <p>In cities like New Haven and Hartford, the percentage of minority teachers is much higher, 31 and 33 percent, respectively; in Bridgeport, it is 25 percent, based on data from the 1998-99 school year. In suburban school districts, the lack of minority instructors is striking -- in many towns, less than 2 percent of the total certified staff, which includes teachers, administrators and instructors, are minority. In Fairfield, for instance, the certified staff is 1.6 percent minority; in Suffield, outside of Hartford, the certified staff is 2.2 percent minority.</p>
        <p>After the Sheff decision, Legislative leaders and Gov. John G. Rowland agreed on measures to improve the numbers. There would be increased magnet schools, charter schools, more interdistrict services and giving students in urban school districts the choice of going to a school in a suburban district, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>The mandate also said that each district had to make an effort. School systems had to come up with a plan for hiring a more racially diverse work force, and the state said it would pay for regional recruitment services to help.</p>
        <p>Today, school officials on the state and and local level said they are still trying hard to attract more minority teachers, but they insist that the process is difficult in a booming economy when many potential applicants are opting for better-paying jobs in other fields.</p>
        <p>The progress in diversifying the teacher work force is alarming legislators and others, and the Legislature in the past session passed a bill setting up a special commission to study the issue of minority teacher hiring.</p>
        <p>Civil rights leaders are also demanding that the state has to take a more aggressive role in dealing with the problem of minority teacher hiring.</p>
        <p>Officials such as Roger Vann, president of the Connecticut N.A.A.C.P., said the state may have to consider some kind of financial rewards, such as signing bonuses, to recruit more minority applicants.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Vann said he feels that most school officials around the state are making a genuine effort, some are not.</p>
        <p>''There are some districts that have no interest in recruiting minority teachers, and local officials think it is offensive to suggest that there should be more diversity among teachers in the classroom,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vann said there have been complaints in Bridgeport and Waterbury about discrimination in hiring and a lack of support by white administrators for minorities. A parent in Westport -- where there's a handful of minority teachers -- filed a complaint with the State Labor Department this year charging that school officials weren't doing enough to create a more diverse teacher staff.</p>
        <p>Many school districts said they want to hire minority teachers, but have difficulty finding candidates. Ralph Burke, superintendent for personnel at Fairfield Schools, said he's always looking for minority teachers. Fairfield advertises job openings in minority publications, lists jobs on a Web site and takes part in job fairs. But the results have been disappointing, he said. A recent job fair, put on by a number of school districts in the region, few minorities candidates attended.</p>
        <p>''We had about 1,000 applicants show up, and you could count the number of minorities on two hands,'' Mr. Burke said.</p>
        <p>The same goes for the number of minority students graduating with teaching degrees. Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven said of the 135 students who graduated with a bachelor's degree from the School of Education last year, 7 were minorities. Of the 195 students who received a master's degree, 5 were minorities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burke and other education officials said that minority college students, who might think about going into teaching, are sometimes drawn to corporations, which can offer a lot more money.</p>
        <p>''An IBM or a Microsoft may knock at the door of a college student who's strong in math or science and say, 'We know you can start in teaching at $33,000 and have your summer off, but if you come with us, we'll start you at $55,000, you'll get four weeks off, and you'll be in six figures in four years.' I hear that's happening,'' said Tom Murphy, a spokesman for the State Department of Education.</p>
        <p>Rodney A. Lane, dean of the School of Education at Southern Connecticut State, said there is a deeper problem.</p>
        <p>''A lot have gone through urban school systems, so they have in their mind what their schools were like, where a whole lot of people didn't want to come,'' Dr. Lane said. ''We've got to overcome a cultural and socioeconomic gap that is large and growing.''</p>
        <p>Maria Lyons, who until recently was the school personnel director for Bridgeport, said that the stronger economy, combined with a greater willingness of employers to hire people without regard to gender or race, means less women and minorities are going into teaching.</p>
        <p>''When I was in school, women had certain roles,'' said Ms. Lyons, who is Puerto Rican. ''You went into nursing, secretarial work or teaching. But now there's so many more options for young people and other careers that pay more than teaching.''</p>
        <p>Also hurting poorer school districts like Bridgeport sometimes is that they can't pay as well as some of the better-off communities. Bridgeport's starting teacher salary for someone with a bachelor's degree is $32,500, below nearby communities like Fairfield, or Norwalk, which pay $34,000 to start. ''We have lost some  people to other towns like Norwalk,'' said Marilyn Ondrasik, director of the Bridgeport Child Advocacy Coalition, which has worked on a teacher recruitment advisory committee in Bridgeport.</p>
        <p>The percentage of minority teachers in Bridgeport, whose student population is 88 percent black, Latino and Asian, has actually dropped a bit from the early 1990's, from 26 percent to 25 percent.</p>
        <p>Laura Williams, a teacher who is Puerto Rican, said she jumped from Bridgeport to Fairfield for better pay and benefits. Although she wouldn't say how much she is earning, she said she is making several thousand dollars more. She teaches Spanish and Latin American culture to fourth, fifth and sixth graders in Fairfield. She said she likes the job security that teaching offers.</p>
        <p>''It's not very often that a public school is going to fold, but companies fold all the time,'' she said.</p>
        <p>There are some who say that money is not the only issue in Bridgeport's efforts to recruit minority teachers.</p>
        <p>Gregory Bracey, who is black, is suing the Bridgeport Board of Education for discrimination, after he was turned down for a teaching job. Mr. Bracey, who has a master's degree in education from the University of Bridgeport and has taught in New Haven and Stamford schools, got a strong recommendation from a principal in the Bridgeport school where he gave a classroom demonstration as part of the hiring process. But he was not given a job and never given a reason. He said he found out later that it may have been because of his hair, which is in dreadlocks. ''I had all the credentials for the job,'' he said. ''I believe this was racism.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lyons would not comment on the case since the matter is in litigation, but she denied that hairstyle would ever be a criterion for hiring.</p>
        <p>Erik Brown, who is also black, said he got fed up and left Bridgeport for the New Haven school system in 1998 after he said he was harassed by supervisors. Even though he had previously been given high ratings for his teaching work in his first year at Bridgeport, everything changed his second year when he questioned a mixed evaluation given by his supervisor. After that, he said, supervisors came to his classroom every day to observe his work. Eventually, he complained to the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter. Mr. Brown claimed there was an ''old boy network'' of white administrators in Bridgeport who were creating a hostile work environment for black teachers.</p>
        <p>Nancy Geter, the chairwoman of the Bridgeport Board of Education, who is black, said she had seen ''no direct evidence'' of bias in city schools.</p>
        <p>''I knew there were problems there, but I can't say that it was definitely discrimination,'' she said about the Brown case. ''It was a matter probably of professional disagreements.''</p>
        <p>The issue of discrimination has also been brought up in Westport, where Joel Freedman, a parent, complained to the state about Westport's progress in hiring minority teachers. Mr. Freedman said he had urged the hiring of more minority teachers at a town forum last year on racial tolerance. The event was held after racist graffiti was found on school lockers.</p>
        <p>Elliott Landon, the Westport Superintendent of Schools, said there was no basis to Mr. Freedman's charge. While he admitted that the school system had only about a half dozen minority teachers, his office was making an effort at hiring black, Latino and Asian teachers. Mr. Landon agreed with officials in other districts that the pool of minority candidates is limited. He added that even though Westport pays the relatively high amount of $38,000 to start, the steep cost of housing in lower Fairfield County deters many people from moving to the area to teach.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we have anything to be ashamed of here,'' he said. ''If anyone wants to come in and check to see what we've done, they can do so.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Geter said it is critical that schools, especially those with high  populations of black and Latino students, have enough minority teachers. For the minority youngster, she said, ''They serve as role models. They motivate you to succeed. It's very important to have a role model to aspire to.''</p>
        <p>Carolyn Nah, president of the Greater Bridgeport Chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., said said more minority teachers are needed because they bring a cultural sensitivity to the job that white teachers may not have, that allows them to handle students better in the sometimes difficult environment of inner-city schools. She said that while Bridgeport's 25 percent minority teacher profile may look good compared with the figures in the suburbs, it's still less than it should be.</p>
        <p>''More minority teachers are needed to better reflect the racial composition of the students in the schools in Bridgeport,'' Ms. Nah said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Staples of the Legislature's Education Committee said minority teachers were important for the majority, too.</p>
        <p>'''It is vitally important to introduce students to people of different backgrounds,'' he said. ''There is educational value to integrate people of different ethnic and cultural groups as part of a well-rounded educational experience.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vann of the N.A.A.C.P. and others believe the state is going to have to lead the way if Connecticut is to increase teacher diversity. The problem comes at a time when there is a shortage of teachers in general, particularly on the secondary level.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vann would like the new task force set up by the Legislature to look a number of possible solutions. First is to develop a coordinated, statewide plan to deal with the issue.</p>
        <p>''The burden of dealing with this problem is too much for one district,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vann also said he thinks the state may have to consider offering financial incentives for people who want to teach in Connecticut, such as signing bonuses. (California is considering tax breaks for new teachers.) Another would be relaxing some of the stringent certification requirements for veteran teachers from out of state, who want to teach in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Mr. Staples said he agreed that the state has to get more involved financially to recruit teachers. He saidtwo ideas that the task force will look at are providing funding to forgive some student loans and mortgage assistance for minority teachers willing to locate in areas where the shortage of minority teachers is most acute.</p>
        <p>Alma Maya of Bridgeport, who is the executive director of a community organization that offers programs to help Latino youth, added that new bilingual certification requirements and other rules also have to be reconsidered, because they are making it harder to recruit Latino teachers.</p>
        <p>''I'm not against strong standards,'' Mr. Vann said. ''But we have to look at all the additional hoops we have put into the process, and how they may mitigate against getting quality teachers here. We've lost people.''</p>
