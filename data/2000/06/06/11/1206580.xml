        <p>AFTER a long and bitter court fight, a federal judge last week ordered Microsoft broken in two.</p>
        <p>From William H. Gates, the chairman, on down, Microsoft is confident that it will win on appeal and keep its operating system and applications businesses intact. But in the meantime, Mr. Gates's close friend Steven A. Ballmer, who became chief executive earlier this year, must manage the company through a minefield of challenges: a resurgent software industry, increasingly obstacles in recruiting and the creation of a new business offering software and services over the Internet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ballmer was in Europe, meeting with customers, when Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his ruling on Wednesday. In London late Thursday night, he took time to talk by telephone about Microsoft's prospects. Following are excerpts from the conversation.</p>
        <p>Q. How do you characterize what you're hearing in Europe about Judge Jackson's ruling?</p>
        <p>A. A lot of support. I had a customer turn to me tonight and say: ''Did you tell them there are a bunch of U.K. customers that would be very disappointed if it's implemented? That there's a bunch of us who really want your stuff to be integrated?'' I'd say that was the most common sentiment. But people are talking to me, so who knows? The fact is I see the world and hear the world through a filter.</p>
        <p>Q. How do the judge's ruling and the ambiguity surrounding the appeals period affect your planning and strategy?</p>
        <p>A. I actually don't see it as an ambiguous time. Our job will continue to be to build the best software we can, to really listen to the consumer. And in the absence of a clear opinion from the district court and the appellate court, we'd probably follow the opinion of the appellate court -- which seemed to be pretty clear two years ago -- that we have the same right that every other company does to continue to enhance and improve our products. We would not be shy about continuing to move forward to enhancing Windows.</p>
        <p>Q. Will it be hard for Microsoft to make deals now? Either partnerships and strategic alliances or investments?</p>
        <p>A. It's something I've wondered about. But all the feedback I've had up to the ruling and all the feedback I've had since I've been out and about this week leads me to believe that people will ask questions, but they will go forward and do the things that are good for them and good for us. And so I don't anticipate that being a major blocking point.</p>
        <p>Q. Has the rate at which you do deals or investments increased or decreased recently?</p>
        <p>A. The level of deal flow is certainly not decreasing, and I suspect now that the capital markets have dried up some, it could well increase. There was a period when people didn't need our money, but they sort of wanted our endorsement. Now that it's a lot tougher to come by money, they're sort of interested in both.</p>
        <p>Q. Bill Gates said several times on Wednesday that he wished he had been more effective at getting the Microsoft message out. Do you think the appeals period will make getting your message out more difficult?</p>
        <p>A. There are sort of two different messages. The message that Bill was talking about I don't think is any easier to get across now that the trial is over, honestly -- to tell the story of the competition and improvement, low prices and how the model works. We both wish, with 20-20 hindsight perhaps, that we had Bill appear during the trial, since our attempt to put him on and me and others as witnesses during the remedy phase failed to result. The judge denied us that request.</p>
        <p>In terms of getting the company's message across now in general -- what we need to do with Next Generation Windows Services and what the partnering strategy looks like -- I think that with the trial in the appellate phase, you'll see the level of attention die down, and we're going to be able to get the kind of time and attention to really attract the press to our message. Our customers have never really lost the focus; they've never really become as D.O.J.-obsessed as the press speculation has.</p>
        <p>Q. What is Microsoft's biggest challenge in the post-trial world?</p>
        <p>A. The biggest challenge -- both pretrial and post-trial -- is creating a clear, well-articulated strategy for our next-generation work to go execute. I can't say that changes with the decision. Being able to effectively pursue making a leadership contribution and having a leadership vision is probably even more important than before.</p>
        <p>Q. How has the balance of power in the software world changed as a result of the trial? What does it look like to you?</p>
        <p>A. I think the perception of the world has changed some. I don't think the world changed. It is ironic, in a certain sense, that at a time when the press is writing about the fact that we are more vulnerable competitively, there's this ruling that stems from the fact that we are too strong. I think the vulnerability was probably there before the trial. The trial has only served to do a better job of balancing the reality with the hype.</p>
        <p>Life has that kind of characteristic to it. Something gets hyped up. Not that we're not influential; we still are. Or the invulnerability of dot-com business models gets hyped up. There is actually this healthiness to the corrections that occur.</p>
        <p>Q. There was a period when I.B.M. was viewed as invincible, and then there was this period when Microsoft was viewed as the new I.B.M. Was the perception of invincibility a kind of capital that you could use that you've lost now?</p>
        <p>A. Probably to some degree. I think that the guys who were in the know understood we were not as powerful as the world was writing. And the guys who were in the know understand they still have great opportunities to shape the world. It's not like there is a shortage of companies that have an interest in working with us or having us invest in them.</p>
        <p>Q. Several years ago, there was a tremendous amount of whining by Silicon Valley venture capitalists about having opportunities closed off by Microsoft. Has that changed?</p>
        <p>A. I don't know. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. We certainly came down to have a dialogue that would highlight symbiotic relationships of opportunity with the venture community. I don't think any of that ever mattered, in the sense that the V.C.'s have always done a good job of finding companies to fund -- many very good, some maybe not so good from time to time. But I don't think our involvement dramatically drove investment one way or another.</p>
        <p>Q. You have a relatively small management team, and you have chosen, by and large, to bring in few outsiders. Do you have the resources to deal with the challenge?</p>
        <p>A. I think we can always do better. I look at expansion having occurred in a number of ways. We have brought in a few, probably not as many as we should have, from the outside, and we may bring in a few more. We've also stretched people in unbelievable ways. We've called on people to stretch themselves in new and interesting ways. But in considering outsiders, it's an area where we can probably do better.</p>
        <p>Q. Could you give me a progress report on your tenure as chief executive and Mr. Gates's tenure as ''chief software architect''?</p>
        <p>A. I feel pretty good about where we are. I think I could still do better at freeing Bill up, but there were a bunch of commitments he made before I became C.E.O. that he has to honor. And the D.O.J. stuff certainly takes more of his time than mine. He's got really the continuity and the sense of the issues. He's spent really a lot of time on the N.G.W.S. issues and opportunities that we face. We're really making a pretty good transition.</p>
        <p>Q. Is it fair to think of Next Generation Windows Services, the new Internet services strategy that you plan to announce on June 22, as a test case for Microsoft's efforts to build new relationships and tone down the rhetoric in the industry?</p>
        <p>A. It's a very good test case. I don't think we can tone down some of the rhetoric. We've got to be positive and certain and committed -- which we are. But we've got to make it clear that this is really an opportunity for a lot of guys, not just an opportunity for us.</p>
        <p>Q. Have you made any progress in finding a business model for the strategy?</p>
        <p>A. You'll see a business model in the making. Which is my way of saying we've got one, and we reserve the right to evolve it.</p>
