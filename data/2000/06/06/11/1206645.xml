        <p>It was the English who first formalized rules for the sport called ''the beautiful game,'' but the country is less known these days for the gracefulness its athletes show on the soccer field than for the ugliness its rabid supporters cause off it.</p>
        <p>When the country's national team begins its participation Monday in a biennial Europe-wide competition being held this year in Belgium and the Netherlands, a team of crack English police officers will be taking up their positions in front of computer screens at the National Crime Intelligence Service here to monitor the moves of the thousands of English fans who have followed their heroes across the Channel.</p>
        <p>The English soccer players enter the Euro 2000 tournament with the worst record of any of the 16 teams that qualified. The English police start the contest with the best reputation for handling rampaging soccer thugs because they have had so much experience at it.</p>
        <p>As a reflection of what a serious national matter soccer hooliganism has become for England, the responsibility for combating it has been assigned to the top-level intelligence agency that was created in 1992 to combat organized crime, international drug dealing, money laundering, immigration fraud and counterfeiting.</p>
        <p>While English athletic authorities are eager to shed the rioting fan reputation to enhance the country's effort to become the host of the 2006 World Cup, the concern goes far beyond sports.</p>
        <p>''The effect of football hooliganism is to shame the nation every time it happens,'' said Mark Steels, the intelligence service's chief spokesman. ''It does about as much damage to England's image as any other form of international activity. After a while, people abroad start thinking that if English fans are like that, that's what all the English are like.''</p>
        <p>Using the favored slang word for the men who shave their heads, paint their faces in team colors, strip down to their ample waists, drink far too much and beat up opposing fans, foreigners all the better, Mr. Steels said, ''Our reputation has been badly sullied by this bunch of yobs.''</p>
        <p>A glass case in the room where the special intelligence squad works displays the tools of the soccer hooligan trade: retractable blades hidden in belt buckles, lighters and pens, brass knuckles, iron bars, spray cans of immobilizing gas and stubby carpentry knives used for inflicting cheek-length facial slashes. On a bulletin board are a collection of calling cards the thugs leave with people they have bloodied. The Silver Cod Squad's reads, ''Now is a time to convalesce, for you've been done by the S.C.S.''</p>
        <p>Aware that the public shares their desire to rein in the army of soccer toughs, the police have posted ''England needs you'' advertisements asking people to phone a number known as the ''hooligan hot line'' with information about rabble-rousers.</p>
        <p>The outbreaks abroad are happening at a time when at home the soccer match violence of the 1970's and 1980's has subsided. Principal stadiums have been rebuilt with all standing-room terraces removed, family-friendly regulations and drinking restrictions have been put in place, stewards are positioned at entrances and security cameras have been installed to permit visual checks of every seat. Opposing fans sit apart from one another during the game and are steered away from one another as they exit the parks by mounted police officers.</p>
        <p>Belgians in particular know the cost of English fans on a tear.</p>
        <p>In 1985, violence by backers of Liverpool at the Heysel stadium in Brussels caused a crowd stampede that killed 39 supporters of the opposing Italian team and led to a five-year ban on English clubs playing on the Continent.</p>
        <p>Last month English and Turkish fans rioted in the main square of Copenhagen, just weeks after they had convulsed downtown Istanbul where two supporters of Leeds United were stabbed to death. The Dutch police are wary of new vengeful clashes since Turkey plays Italy on Sunday in Arnhem, just 50 miles  from Eindhoven, where England plays Portugal on Monday.</p>
        <p>In a get-tough strategy, the Dutch police say they intend to dispel their  reputation for being Europe's most laid back force, and Belgian officials say their officers will be able to detain people on minimum suspicion. Jeu Springers, president of the Dutch football federation, said, ''I don't know what the English supporters intend to do and we know their reputation, but if they're coming with the intention of destroying our cities, we have a zero tolerance policy.''</p>
        <p>Alain Courtois, a director of the tournament, said at a Brussels press conference, ''We know some people are coming here to cause trouble, but they have to know they can be arrested based on the feeling of the policeman and can be held for 12 hours.''</p>
        <p>Officials in Eindhoven have announced that only half-strength beer will be on sale in areas where fans will be gathering for England's opening match. In Charleroi, the small Belgian town that is the scene for the game next Saturday that law enforcement people fear most -- England vs. Germany -- the garage of a 19th-century gendarmerie near the stadium has been converted into a detention center with steel bars and cellblocks capable of holding a total of 1,000 people.</p>
        <p>German fans rioted in France during the World Cup two years ago and left a policeman permanently maimed, and Berlin has responded by passing a law that has enabled authorities to bar 2,700 identified hooligans from leaving the country. The English police sought a similar law, but the government did not  produce it.</p>
        <p>The English authorities are able to hold back 99 troublemakers who have so-called international travel bans, but it cannot bar travel by 416 others who have only national bans.  Instead the police have furnished the Dutch and Belgian police with photos and information about them and 500 other potential rioters and have sent men called ''football intelligence officers'' from England over to the sites of games.</p>
        <p>The Germans, the Dutch and the Turks all have belligerent fans and histories of melees, but Mr. Steels is impatient with people here who argue that the English are not to blame for much of the violence that occurs when they go abroad. ''Yes, it's always somebody else's fault,'' he said wearily.</p>
        <p>''They'll say the police were too tough or the police were too soft, the stadium was the wrong shape, the Turks provoked us, we found ourselves at the wrong end of the pitch, they don't have a proper lager, they don't speak English in 'them' countries, you can't get a cab at 4 in the morning, nobody told us this was the red-light district, they didn't serve Theakstons bitter.''</p>
        <p>''How are people supposed to react to seeing their wonderful historic cities laid waste?'' he went on. ''People in Germany certainly know about drinking beer, but that doesn't mean they're used to people who start doing it at 12 noon and are still standing up eight hours later, their guts all sunburned, singing patriotic songs after doing nothing but laying about and drinking all day.''</p>
