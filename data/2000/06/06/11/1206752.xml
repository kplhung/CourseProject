        <p>Scarsdale High School decided last week that it would disband its rifle team. Team members objected, saying the team teaches gun safety. ''It gave the student who is not 6-foot-3 and 200 pounds a chance to participate in a competitive sport,'' said Michael V. McGill, the district superintendent. But, he added, officials decided to disband the team after a bomb scare at the school last year and incidents like the Columbine massacre. Still, he said, the decision was less of a security decision than one of policy. ''We're not afraid our kids will do anything like that,'' he said, ''but it's an issue of what kind of stance does the school have against firearms and youth, and is it still appropriate for us, in the current climate, to have a rifle team? We concluded that this is no longer something that should be sponsored by the school.''</p>
