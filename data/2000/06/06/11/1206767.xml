        <p>Shanae Dawkins, a New Rochelle sophomore, won three events yesterday in the New York State high school outdoor championships at Liverpool High near Syracuse.</p>
        <p>Dawkins produced personal bests in all three events -- the 400-meter intermediate hurdles, the 100 hurdles and the triple jump. Last March in the indoor state meet, she won both the 55 hurdles and the triple jump.</p>
        <p>Dawkins, in a duel with Shevon Stoddart of Uniondale, took the 400 hurdles in 60.73 seconds, the fastest time in the state this year; the 100 hurdles in 14.22 seconds, also a state best this season; and the triple jump at 39 feet 3i inches, surpassing her own state-leading distance of 38-8.</p>
        <p>Anthony Ewers, Jason Jabaut, and Neisha Bernard Thomas registered impressive victories. Ewers, of Long Island's Lawrence High, won the boys' 400 in 47.37 seconds; Jabaut, from Seton Catholic in Plattsburgh, won the 1,600 in 4 minutes 9.50 seconds; and Bernard Thomas, of Brooklyn's Tilden, won the girls' 400 in 53.80. All three times were the best in the state this season.</p>
        <p>Paul Ciurlys, the Walt Whitman senior who chased Damion Drummond of Brooklyn's Paul Robeson all indoor season, caught Drummond yesterday in the final 400 meters of the boys' 800 and beat him by three meters. Ciurlys was timed in 1:52.46, a personal best, and Drummond in 1:53.31.</p>
        <p>Sean Lambert of Brooklyn's South Shore took the 200 in 21.52 seconds and his teammate Nimal Bailey was the 400 hurdles victor in 54.14.</p>
