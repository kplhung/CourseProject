        <p>KATHY ROACH practices her best handshake and smile in a simple exercise she and 25 other eager participants act out during an orientation session for the ''Philadelphia Friends,'' a select corps of volunteers who have agreed to be on call 24 hours a day when Republicans converge on Philadelphia next month for its quadrennial national convention.</p>
        <p>Ms. Roach, a longtime Ocean City resident who now lives in Philadelphia and a self-described ''staunch Republican,'' sees the convention and her assignment as destiny.</p>
        <p>''Everything I do, everything in my background has led me to this point,'' said the 41-year-old corporate legal assistant during a break at the Philadelphia Convention Center. ''It gives me goose bumps just to think about it.''</p>
        <p>Clearly, she is not in need of a five-hour intensive Dale Carnegie training course on smiling and being a cheerful ambassador for the region, as many volunteers are.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, across the Benjamin Franklin Bridge -- one of four spans over the Delaware River  connecting the convention city with the Garden State -- a fresh layer of macadam has been laid across a large stretch of land between the New Jersey State Aquarium and the base of the bridge.</p>
        <p>Over the next several weeks trees and flowers will be planted, grandstands and garden tables will be set up, and this expanse of waterfront -- until recently strewn with rubble from demolished RCA manufacturing plants -- will serve as the first official gathering site for the Republican delegates after they have arrived in the Delaware Valley. The welcoming event, a lighted boat parade followed by fireworks and a laser light show, will feature Governor Whitman as host.</p>
        <p>Not every place revels at being a welcome mat. But when the governor started bulldozing liquor stores, strip clubs and hot pillow joints along the Admiral Wilson Boulevard here, that was precisely what she had in mind.</p>
        <p>For months, New Jersey Republicans have been gearing up for their party's biggest event, being held in close proximity for the first time since 1948, when the Republicans -- as well as the Democrats -- came to Philadelphia. Then there was the Democratic  Convention in 1964 in a badly deteriorated Atlantic City, which that city is still trying to live down.</p>
        <p>From the governor to vice presidential hopefuls (which in this case, may be one and the same person) to future gubernatorial or Senate candidates, to Republican party leaders to local Republican clubs to South Jersey Girl Scouts, having the convention across the river is rich in potential.</p>
        <p>Landing the convention's opening event was a major coup for the state, even if it was partly by default -- construction work along the Philadelphia waterfront is planned for this summer -- and largely designed to shine the spotlight back onto the City of Brotherly Love, since the waterfront here offers one of the best views of the city's skyline.</p>
        <p>Still, New Jersey officials see it as a great chance to give the delegates an early glimpse at their state as well as provide an excellent platform for Governor Whitman, who remains among the handful of names being discussed for the vice presidential slot.</p>
        <p>''The governor wants to be very active at the convention,'' said Rick Mroz, who recently stepped down as the governor's chief counsel and is her designee to the convention host committee. ''If she's asked to give a speech, she'd be happy to. She has always believed very strongly in supporting the party, so no matter what the candidate asks of her, she'll be there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mroz added that while his boss had not engaged in the speculation about herself as Gov. George W. Bush's running mate, ''she has said if she is asked, she would love to do it.'' It would not be the first time Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Bush shared the stage at a Republican National Convention; at the 1996 gathering in San Diego, they were co-chairman and chairwoman.</p>
        <p>In addition to the July 30 boat parade, Mrs. Whitman plans to conduct tours showcasing such economic development sites as state-financed housing projects in Atlantic City or the faith-based housing projects in Camden where New Jersey has gotten them grant money as well as play host of one other large event during convention week, Mr. Mroz said. She has had her eye on the Philadelphia Zoo, but this being one of the most popular venues, she might have to get in line.</p>
        <p>Just behind Governor Whitman are other party leaders, many of whom have had their presence at the convention assured by virtue of their ''at-large'' delegate status. While each of New Jersey's 13 congressional districts elect 3 delegates and 3 alternates, another 15 at-large delegates (and their alternates) are chosen, the ranks of which are filled with names like State Senate President Don DiFrancesco, Assembly Speaker Jack Collins and former Gov. Tom Kean.</p>
        <p>Of course Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Collins, both of whom are expected to seek the office Mrs. Whitman will be vacating next year, will be looking at the convention as a place to raise their political profile.</p>
        <p>Then there is the state Republican Party chairman, Chuck Haytaian of Hackettstown, who has his work cut out for him, not only trying to organize events where New Jersey party leaders can shine, but also making arrangements for the state's delegation.</p>
        <p>Although the official delegation consists of 54 delegates and 54 alternates, Mr. Haytaian has requested 385 hotel rooms -- an increase of 100 rooms since the last convention in San Diego, when New Jersey showed up with the second-largest delegation. He said they needed that many rooms because of the large number of ''honorary delegates'' -- those who want to attend the convention but were not elected -- and requests from the media.</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Haytaian may be able to arrange accommodations, getting everyone into the convention itself is another story.  The 20,000-square-foot floor of Comcast-Spectacor's First Union Center will be largely dedicated to the convention's 2,066 delegates. Much of the remaining space in the sports arena, which holds 21,000 people for sporting events, will be taken up by the 2,066 alternates and 15,000 members of the media who have requested credentials. Each delegate and alternate gets one guest pass each day, which, by the time of the convention, will be the most sought-after tickets in town.</p>
        <p>''People just want to go down there and get on the floor,'' said the harried state chairman. ''That's great you want to do that, but it's not possible. We'll try to get as many people as possible in. It's very limited, and not easy, but since I'm on the badges and credentials committee, maybe we'll have a little easier time doing that this year.''</p>
        <p>Then there are the volunteers, who have almost no chance of getting on the convention floor but are signing up in droves nonetheless. Allison Grove, director of community outreach for Philadelphia 2000, has already lined up close to 12,000 volunteers, whose jobs will range from checking credentials to greeting people at the airport to manning booths at PoliticalFest, a public fair with politically themed exhibitions that will run during the convention.</p>
        <p>Ms. Grove estimates 20 percent of those volunteers are from New Jersey, making it the second-largest feeder state after Pennsylvania. She cited two South Jersey Republicans clubs as among the earliest and most enthusiastic about getting involved.</p>
        <p>After having Ms. Grove as a luncheon guest with club members last December, the Burlington County Republican Women's Club has processed 500 volunteer applications, said the club's president, Rosemary Nichols.</p>
        <p>And the Cinnaminson Republican Club had so many people eager sign up that the Republican municipal chairman, Richard Stroebel, decided to register the club as a corporate team, giving club members shuttle transportation to various volunteer posts, plus on-site training. Dale Carnegie is providing training for all volunteers, focusing on customer service skills and team building, as well as providing a crash course on Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware.</p>
        <p>''We want to make sure people are confident in their ability to act as ambassadors of the region, said Angela Brown of Erial, a spokeswoman for Philadelphia 2000. ''They'll be told things like, never say 'I don't know' when asked a question and always smile -- things like that.''</p>
        <p>In addition to organizing his own club's participation, Mr. Stroebel has signed on to be one of the estimated 100 ''Philadelphia Friends.'' He is taking two weeks off from his law practice to serve as tour guide, advisor and Philadelphia ambassador to the members of whichever state delegation he is assigned.</p>
        <p>''It's so close, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' said the 36-year-old lawyer, who got his start in politics as the head of the college Republicans at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia. ''I was born and raised here. I know a lot about the area and I can help make us look real good. I can help the party this year too.''</p>
        <p>Although he has worked as an assistant counsel to Governor Kean and chief counsel for the Burlington County Board of Social Services, Mr. Stroebel is realistic enough to know he and he fellow club members may not be connected enough to get on the convention floor.</p>
        <p>''From the beginning I was told that the reason for getting involved is to have a lot of fun,'' he said. ''I tell everyone who asks about volunteering that no matter what they're assigned, they'll get a good taste of what a convention is all about.''</p>
        <p>About 60 cadette and senior Girl Scouts from Camden County will join Philadelphia girls later this month to begin cleaning up parks and helping make Philadelphia shine. During the week of the convention, they will also be on hand to greet visitors coming to Philadelphia. For their efforts, they will receive an ''election connection'' patch to add to their sashes, and a sense of being part of history.</p>
        <p>''As Girl Scouts, we wouldn't ever endorse one political party over another,'' said Rona Whitehead, membership director for the Girl Scouts of Camden County. ''This way we can get involved, and support Philadelphia and the election process without getting too political about it. How often are we ever going to have a convention in a neighboring city? It's a great learning experience.''</p>
