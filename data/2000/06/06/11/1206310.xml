        <p>In 1998, Michael Borer developed the LoveGety to help Japanese teenagers find romance. Using omnidirectional radio waves, the LoveGety senses anyone within a 50-foot range who is also carrying the device, then receives and displays data on how far that person might want to get involved. (The five modes are chat, dinner, dance, kiss and love.) Two million were sold in Japan in the first year.</p>
        <p>Borer is now developing an updated model for sale in America. The Electronic Cupid will store an encrypted profile of its owner -- based on questions about background, hobbies and morals -- and when two carriers come within range, their devices will automatically swap profiles and evaluate compatibility.</p>

        <p>Borer is now developing an updated model for sale in America. The Electronic Cupid will store an encrypted profile of its owner -- based on questions about background, hobbies and morals -- and when two carriers come within range, their devices will automatically swap profiles and evaluate compatibility.</p>
        <p>These gadgets, however, may be outdated soon after they hit the market. Online dating services will soon be able to stream personal data to personal digital assistants, beepers and cellular phones. And since the data will be stored on servers rather than in the hardware itself, it can include the sort of exhaustive information, gleaned from lengthy questionnaires and personal essays, that traditional dating services pride themselves on. Anyone belonging to a service will be electronically notified when another member is in the vicinity, and in the amount of time it takes to call up a file, can download detailed information on that person and make some quick decisions about whether love is in the air.</p>
        <p>Ted Selker of the M.I.T. Media Lab says that this is just the beginning of a new kind of mating ritual. Selker is currently creating devices that monitor what he calls our ''implicit'' modes of communication, the ''tells'' in our computer-using patterns. One of Selker's text-based programs scans a person's e-mail, searching for common and quirky words, then makes conclusions about what that language says about personality. Another project, the ''interest tracker,'' is capable of scanning the eye movements of someone browsing the Web to determine what kind of information he is drawn to, down to the millisecond. It then uses that growing cache of data to constantly update one's personality profile. These profiles, which Selker says are infinitely more sophisticated -- and accurate -- than the paper-and-pencil profiles used by dating services, can then be cross-referenced with those stored and broadcast by other's machines, assessing much more than whether two people might hit it off for dinner and a movie.</p>
        <p>When asked if this doesn't take some of the mystery out of courtship, Selker's response is purely pragmatic. ''You have to realize that a lifelong partner isn't just about combustible,'' he says. ''Computers will help us understand who we really are as opposed to who we think we are.''</p>
