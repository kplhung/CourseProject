        <p>ORDINARY RESURRECTIONS</p>
        <p>Children in the Years of Hope.</p>
        <p>By Jonathan Kozol.</p>
        <p>388 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Crown Publishers. $25.</p>
        <p>IN the mid-1960's, when Jonathan Kozol, an idealistic Harvard graduate, taught fourth grade in Boston's inner city, and emerged with a devastating tale of social neglect, he helped define an era. Like its title, the book, ''Death at an Early Age,'' had the unadorned brilliance of a well-conceived slogan (''Give peace a chance''). Kozol was rightly seen as a young man of courage, a symbol of his generation.</p>
        <p>Since that time and that book, much -- and not much -- has changed. School busing has come and largely gone, civil rights has turned into affirmative action, which has come under widespread attack. Roxbury and similar neighborhoods and the schools that serve them remain beacons of despair. Concern over continuing school segregation has waned. Now the talk is of uniforms, standards and high-stakes tests.</p>
        <p>And while other activists of his day have shifted focus or sought different challenges, Kozol has spent the past few decades producing books, articles and lectures with the same lament, the same outrage. Most recently, in 1995, he wrote ''Amazing Grace: The Lives of Children and the Conscience of a Nation,'' a depiction of Mott Haven in the South Bronx. Such works have seemed to some critics like yet more renditions of ''The Times They Are a-Changin', ''without the freshness and immediacy of the first version. In other words, Kozol, while a hero to some, was viewed by others as something of a pious, repetitive scold.</p>
        <p>The title of his new book, ''Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope,'' has the same evocation of faith as ''Amazing Grace'' and the same narrative focus, Mott Haven, an area whose concentrations of pediatric and maternal AIDS are among the nation's highest. And the book has some familiarly irritating qualities. It can be pious (''The life of a child, after all, is made up not of social 'constructs' or developmental 'trends,' but of much smaller things like stomachaches or hurtful words or red Crayola crayons'') and mundane (''Even with caution, I think it is accurate to say that many of the older people in Mott Haven who have talked with me at length feel contradictory emotions -- and, at times, a roller coaster of emotions -- in regard to the conditions of their lives and prospects for their neighborhood'').</p>
        <p>Yet over all the book is affecting, in places deeply moving. This is the most personal of Kozol's efforts and the humblest. It preaches only rarely. Mostly, it observes the lives and explores the feelings of a group of black and Hispanic youngsters -- and a few adults -- he has gotten to know at a local after-school program in an Episcopal church and two nearby elementary schools.</p>
        <p>Kozol has been visiting and watching these children since the early 1990's but, as he says, he had not before taken the time to get to know them as individuals. They were objects of inquiry, tools in a policy argument. As he started to age -- he is now 63 -- and watch his own parents approach death, he says he began to look at his life and work in a new light. The result is a book of small insights into the lives of inner-city schoolchildren.</p>
        <p>This is a meaningful accomplishment. For all the scores of books on children and education published each year, most everything about learning is still remarkably mysterious. We are confused not only about how students translate squiggles on paper into systems of language and quantitative analysis but also why certain approaches work for some and not others and how to understand the nature of the link between education and economic success.</p>
        <p>These questions are not answered in ''Ordinary Resurrections,'' whose title is taken from the label an Episcopal priest once offered Kozol for ''the commonplace and frequently unnoticed ways that people rise above their loneliness and fear.'' But in an unpretentious manner, the difficulties these youngsters face are made real: the fathers who are ''upstate'' (in prison), the drugs on the streets, the unconscionably overcrowded classrooms, the lack of art and music in the curriculum, the endless churn of uncertified teachers and new pupils whose families move from shelter to tenement. Sometimes Kozol tells a story with a simple number or two: of the 1,900 students enrolled each year at Morris High School, 1,200 are in ninth grade; about 65 make it through 12th grade.</p>
        <p>Kozol takes us into the classrooms and homes of the South Bronx. He notes the syntax of the grandmothers (''I'm tryin' to sustain'') and the language of the children (''I have the beauty of my mother and the braveness of my father''). A girl explains how she makes pancakes for her mother's boyfriend (''You pour it on the pan and then it's cooking on the pan and then you look at it until it gets a little brown and then you start to see the little bubbles''). Kozol says that in the past he would skip such digressions, but ''now it seems to be the moments of digression I remember with most interest later on.''</p>
        <p>Living alone with his dog in Massachusetts, having no children of his own and with his parents ailing, Kozol began to look upon the Mott Haven community as a surprising source of human contact and comfort. He looks at the underserved youngsters and thinks of his own father, a Jew who grew up poor in South Boston and Roxbury but got into Harvard College and medical school and became a renowned expert on seizures.</p>
        <p>What plagues Kozol, and what, in effect, plagues American education, is why the wonderful kids he comes to love in Mott Haven, kids named Elio and Pineapple and Katrice, can't walk in his father's footsteps. His father, he said, was ''educated to inherit treasures'' and then adds, ''Why shouldn't Ariel and Pineapple inherit treasures too? My father's mother was ambitious for her sons. Their mothers are ambitious for their children. . . . What will actually happen to these children that we know?'' Unlike Kozol's earlier books, ''Ordinary Resurrections'' does not imply that his eloquent outrage is itself an answer. Rather, with humility and grace, it helps us more thoughtfully ponder the question.</p>
