        <p>Laquan Crawford usually spends his summers in his mother's apartment in central Harlem and the sometimes unpredictable areas nearby. Laquan, a soft-spoken 8-year-old, does a good job of avoiding trouble. But last summer, while tucked away in the tranquil hills of Vermont, he had a run-in of sorts -- with a goat named May.</p>
        <p>''It tried to eat my clothes,'' he said. ''I kept moving backwards.'' The incident ended when Laquan stepped back and the goat lost interest.</p>
        <p>But hungry goat and all, Laquan was grateful for his respite from the city, he said one recent afternoon, as he and a half-dozen other 8- and 9-year old boys and girls sat in a community center in central Harlem, carefully preparing letters in newly learned cursive writing for their host families of last summer.</p>
        <p>All the boys and girls had shared an experience: they had all been given the scarce opportunity to enter a new world, courtesy of The Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that began treating needy children from New York City to free summer vacations in 1877, when the Rev. Willard Parsons asked members of his parish in rural Sherman, Pa., if they would take in children from Lower East Side tenements for a summer.</p>
        <p>The children from Harlem recalled learning to swim and seeing a wide variety of animals up close, and they reminisced about hikes in the woods. They made new friends who had never heard the words ''housing project,'' and who were more familiar with the way earthworms work their way out of the ground in the rain than the way a wad of chewing gum hardens on a concrete sidewalk.</p>
        <p>Laquan, who stayed with a family of four in Walcott, Vt., and plans to see them again this summer, is a second-generation Fresh Air Fund recipient.</p>
        <p>His mother, Bess, went on a Fresh Air summer vacation when she was 7. She said that while Laquan was away, she spoke often with him and his hosts, Lorraine and David Vissering, who had taken Laquan into their home and made him feel like another of their children.</p>
        <p>''They said he was so excited, he jumped in the water with his shoes and socks still on,'' she said of a swimming trip Laquan took with the family to a lake near their home.</p>
        <p>The Harlem community center, on West 133rd Street, is run by St. Philip's Episcopal Church. The church, one of the several community groups that work with the fund, helps fill 736 spots in The Fresh Air Fund's two retreat programs: five camps in upstate New York and a coordination effort called the Friendly Town Program, which pairs children from the city with families or individuals from rural and suburban areas who volunteer to act as their hosts.</p>
        <p>The church's chief registrar for the program, Gladys A. Clark, said that their allotted spaces for the camps were already filled and that she expected that, as usual, she would not be able to accommodate all the children who wanted to enroll. ''We have to wait for Fresh Air Fund to give us additional spots, if there are any,'' she said. ''We have children on the waiting list; if I find a spot, I call them up.''</p>
        <p>While the available spaces are limited by the size of the camps, the more people who volunteer to be hosts, the more children who will be able to enjoy the vacations.</p>
        <p>Although many of the children who participate are nervous because they are leaving home for the first time, 65 percent of those who get a spot in the Friendly Town program return for a second summer, often at the same host family's invitation.</p>
        <p>While The Fresh Air Fund always accepts donations, the Friendly Town program would not be possible were it not for the generosity of suburban and rural families who open their homes to the New York City children.</p>
        <p>''I just wish more people would be involved in inviting these children to their homes for two weeks,'' Ms. Clark, the registrar, said. ''They become almost an extended family. Once they get to learn about a child, to love a child, they want to help them succeed.''</p>
        <p>Families who are interested in having a child stay with them or who wish to inquire about registering their children for a Fresh Air summer vacation may call (800) 367-0003 or visit the agency's Web site, www.freshair.org. Tax-deductible contributions to the agency may be made by sending a check to The Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.</p>
