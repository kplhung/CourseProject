        <p>FOR every student who has ever sat in school and thought, ''Someday, when I run the place . . . '' Dr. Eve Rice's recent election to the Byram Hills school board may offer hope.</p>

        <p>FOR every student who has ever sat in school and thought, ''Someday, when I run the place . . . '' Dr. Eve Rice's recent election to the Byram Hills school board may offer hope.</p>
        <p>As a member of the 1969 graduating class from Byram Hills High School in Armonk, Dr. Rice is an example of the benefits of a Byram Hills education. She was a member of Yale's first co-educational class, received a medical degree from Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan, and earned her psychiatry credentials from Cornell.</p>
        <p>Oh, yes, and somewhere between Yale and medical school, Dr. Rice spent more than a decade as a children's book writer and illustrator, with more than 18 books to her credit, including favorites like ''Sam Who Never Forgets'' and ''Benny Bakes a Cake.'' A senior seminar at Yale with Maurice Sendak, the children's author and illustrator, helped launch her writing career.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes not knowing a lot is an advantage,'' she said. ''I went ahead with great confidence. If I had known how high the hurdles were, I might not have pursued it.''</p>
        <p>Although she was successful as a writer, Dr. Rice felt the tug of a medical career.</p>
        <p>''From the outside looking in, it looks like a radical shift,'' she said of her decision to return to school in her early 30's to study medicine. ''From the inside, it was much more of a continuum. I was interested in psychology and psychiatry for a number of years, even while I was writing children's books. I'm fascinated with the way the mind works. You're feeling around the edges of that when you're doing books. Writing about characters, you imagine the way they think and try to understand why they think the way they do, and obviously psychiatry is another way of trying to get into someone's head and understand what motivates them.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Rice, who is married to a doctor, admitted that in switching from a purely creative endeavor to the more rigorous world of medicine and science she was responding to a personal need to expand her own horizons.</p>
        <p>''I felt that my logical, deductive side was underutilized,'' she said. ''I was kind of hungering for that kind of discipline and knowledge. And psychiatry appealed because there's a lot more play and art than in other aspects of medicine.''</p>
        <p>Changes in the way hospital-based psychiatry is practiced led Dr. Rice to another turning point, and her current role on the Byram Hills school board.</p>
        <p>''Hospital-based psychiatry had become more frustrating, in having to attend to the needs of the managed-care company and nonpatient work,'' she said. ''As a long-time student of human development, the whole issue of what makes for a good education, and the ways in which children can be educated, came to be a fascinating problem.''</p>
        <p>While she has left children's books for the time being, Dr. Rice said that she intends to keep writing nonfiction.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rice took care to point out that she had been delighted with her education at Byram Hills, adding that she wants to maintain the district's educational quality.</p>
        <p>''I believe very, very strongly in education and excellence in education,'' said Dr. Rice, whose three children attend the Byram Hills public schools. ''Kids spend six hours a day in school, and you need to make it good and productive for all the students.''</p>
        <p>Her experiences as a parent also encouraged Dr. Rice's involvement with the local schools.</p>
        <p>''In being on the school board, I'm moving from a position as a parent to  a position where I can effectively provide for all the kids in the district,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Even so, Dr. Rice conceded that her children would prefer that she ''drop everything else and write children's books.''</p>
        <p>She explained: ''It's hard for them to say, 'Oh, my mom goes to meetings at nights.' It's easier to say, 'My mom writes those books you're reading.' That has meaning in their world.''</p>
