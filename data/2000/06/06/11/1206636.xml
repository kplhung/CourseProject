        <p>Judit Polgar of Hungary surpassed a former world champion, Anatoly Karpov, and the current International Chess Federation champion, Aleksandr Khalifman, both of Russia, in winning the Japfa Classic International Tournament in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia, recently.</p>
        <p>In this 10-player invitational event, held April 22 to May 2 at the Bali Beach Hotel, the 23-year-old grandmaster scored 6 1/2-1 1/2 and picked up a $20,000 prize.</p>
        <p>As the last round got under way, four players -- Polgar, Karpov, Khalifman and the Brazilian grandmaster Gilberto Milos -- were tied at 5 1/2 each. Polgar defeated Milos to take undisputed first place as Karpov and Khalifman played to a draw and tied for second.</p>
        <p>Control and precision were Polgar's weapons in her victory over Milos.</p>
        <p>The attack with 6 Bc4 against the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian was considered ridiculous half a century ago. Black simply plays 6 . . . e6, as in this game, and continues with an early . . . d5. This was thought to spoil  the opponent's plan.</p>
        <p>Actually, this line leaves Black with an isolated d pawn after ed ed, and there is no joy in that. Bobby Fischer brought 6 Bc4 to life in the 1960's.</p>
        <p>An alternative to 7 . . . b5, namely 7 . . . Nbd7 8 f4 Nc5, worked out well for Black after 9 e5 Nfd7 10 ed Nf6 11 Be3 Bd6 12 Qf3 Qc7 13 O-O-O Bd7 in a Lanc-K. Hertel correspondence game, 1997-99. But Polgar wants something more adventurous.</p>
        <p>After 10 . . . Qb7, the black defense has taken shape. The black queen and king knight bear down on the e4 pawn, while the queen bishop guards against a possible sacrifice on e6. This was introduced by Lubomir Kavalek against Yevgeny Vasyukov in a Moscow-Prague match in 1966.</p>
        <p>After 11 . . . Nbd7, Milos abstained from 12 Qg7?! because 12 . . . Rg8 13 Qh6 Ne4 14 Qh7 Ndf6 15 Qh3 Nc3 16 bc e5 costs him his queen.</p>
        <p>On 17 . . . bc, Milos could have kept material even by recapturing with 18 bc, although after 18 . . . Nb3 19 Rab1 e5 20 Nc2 f5! 21 Rb3 Qc6 22 ef Bf5, Polgar would have the advantage of the two bishops.</p>
        <p>Instead, he chose a line that played directly into Polgar's 22 . . . Qb3, winning a pawn.</p>
        <p>After Polgar's 35 . . . Bc4!, there was nothing for Milos to do but go into 36 Nd6 Nd6 37 Rd6 Qd6 38 Qd6 Rd6 39 Rd6, when her 39 . . . a3! set up a winning endgame.</p>
        <p>He could not play 40 Rd1 because 40 . . . ab 41 Rb1 Rb3! 42 Bb2 Bd3! 43 Rd1 Rb2 44 Rd3 ends in 44 . . . Rb1.</p>
        <p>After 44 . . . Rc2, Milos had to lose heavy material. For example, 45 Be1 Bc4, and there is no coping with the looming 46 . . . Rc1. He gave up at once.</p>
