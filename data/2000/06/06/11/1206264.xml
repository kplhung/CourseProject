        <p>Ultima Thule</p>
        <p>By Davis McCombs.</p>
        <p>Yale University, cloth, $19; paper, $11.</p>
        <p>Named for the most remote cavern in Mammoth Cave National Park, ''Ultima Thule,'' chosen by W. S. Merwin as the winner of this year's Yale Series of Younger Poets competition, lucidly mines Kentucky's cave country as its subject matter. Divided into three sections, the poems here compose a varied triptych depicting Davis McCombs's experiences as a park ranger in Mammoth, as well as the imagined experiences of a fascinating predecessor -- Stephen Bishop, a 19th-century slave who worked as a guide at the caves and was the first to explore hundreds of its caverns. To evoke Bishop's perspective in the opening section's poems, McCombs employs the rigid structure of the sonnet -- though he loosens it up by avoiding rhyme schemes and ironclad meter. Throughout, Mammoth's fantastical underworld -- a place of ''eyeless fish,'' dripstone nodules that ''live and grow, and when struck, produce / melodious tones, liquid and wavering,'' boat rides on subterranean rivers reminiscent of ''Styx, Lethe'' -- is calmly revealed through McCombs's translucent, musical language. But while Bishop's perspective always seems slightly more echo than fully imagined voice, McCombs plumbs deeper in a grouping of free-verse poems and another sequence of sonnets that speak from the perspective of an autobiographical ''I.'' In these, the rough geology of the landscape (''Tonight the river is at work dissolving, solving / over and over the riddle of its loosening'') and the discovery of its shape (''what artifact will tell the future / of a longing wild and inarticulate, / of a dark place loved and gotten in the blood?'') become urgent images that strikingly illuminate darkened interior spaces.</p>
