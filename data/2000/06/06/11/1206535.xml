        <p>At 4:30 a.m. on May 26, Carl Weston and William Green were in their Metropolitan Avenue apartment duplicating a 45-minute videotape of New York City graffiti writers in action. As they slipped copies of the tape, called Videograf 2000, into cardboard covers, a knock sounded at the door.</p>
        <p>The late-night visitors were members of the Police Department's Bronx Vandal Squad. They had a warrant. For the next four hours, the officers searched the four-room apartment, finally leaving, Mr. Weston said, with several hundred videotapes and about $20,000 worth of computers, videocameras and editing equipment.</p>

        <p>At 4:30 a.m. on May 26, Carl Weston and William Green were in their Metropolitan Avenue apartment duplicating a 45-minute videotape of New York City graffiti writers in action. As they slipped copies of the tape, called Videograf 2000, into cardboard covers, a knock sounded at the door.</p>
        <p>The late-night visitors were members of the Police Department's Bronx Vandal Squad. They had a warrant. For the next four hours, the officers searched the four-room apartment, finally leaving, Mr. Weston said, with several hundred videotapes and about $20,000 worth of computers, videocameras and editing equipment.</p>
        <p>During the last 10 years, Mr. Weston has produced a dozen videotapes showing graffiti writers ''bombing'' trains and ''tagging'' walls. Although he films some scenes himself, Mr. Weston said, most of the footage is sent to him by graffiti writers who record their own actions.</p>
        <p>Five days after the raid, Mr. Weston, 32, a freelance graphic designer,  sat in his ground-floor apartment, where clothes and papers were still strewn across the floor.</p>
        <p>''They cannot stand the graffiti underground,'' Mr. Weston said of the police. ''And now they are trying to shut down a form of artistic expression because it's connected to something they don't like.''</p>
        <p>A police spokesman, Detective Walter Burns, said the warrant had been issued as part of an investigation into vandalism. The police got information that Mr. Weston had videotapes showing acts of vandalism, including graffiti, throughout the city, the detective said.</p>
        <p>''No one is being charged right now,'' Detective Burns said. ''But the investigation will go on.''</p>
        <p>In a similar case in December, police officers with a warrant searched the SoHo apartment of Stephen J. Powers, a graffiti writer and the author of a book on graffiti. The officers, from the Transit Authority Vandal Squad, seized art supplies, photographs and videotapes.</p>
        <p>The police said that raid, too, was part of a vandalism investigation. But Mr. Powers said then that he was being harassed because of an anti-Giuliani protest he was planning for Washington Square that week. The protesters hurled simulated elephant dung at a portrait he had made of Mayor Giuliani. The portrait was based on ''Holy Virgin Mary,'' the painting in the ''Sensation'' exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum that the mayor found offensive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weston said that the loss of his equipment was an impediment, but said that his filmmaking would continue. He added that he would soon start work on a fictional film about the graffiti world. The Vandal Squad, he said, will be written into the script.</p>
