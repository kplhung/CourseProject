        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>We recently received a postcard telling us that was time to renew our dog license, and it reminded me of an incident a few years ago when my wife brought one of our male dogs to the Ridgewood Village Hall to have his license renewed.</p>
        <p>The fee for neutered animals was significantly less, so we applied for that one. When the official asked my wife if she had proof that our dog was neutered, she offered to set the dog  down on the counter for an examination.</p>
        <p>''That won't be necessary,'' the official responded, and promptly stamped the application.</p>
        <p>BOYD A. LOVING</p>
        <p>An acquaintance and I boarded the Midtown Direct for Manhattan one recent morning and ended up sitting across the aisle from a woman -- dressed in the obligatory all-black outfit with bracelets dripping from her wrists -- not just talking on her cell phone but literally shouting.</p>
        <p>Though trying to read my newspaper, I couldn't help but hear her discussing a coif -- presumably hers -- and telling the person on the other end of the ether that it was a ''fashionable cut.''</p>
        <p>At that point she ratcheted up the volume, approaching the threshold of pain, and shouted: ''I'm losing you. I'll call you from work.''</p>
        <p>No sooner had she hung up (what's the appropriate idiom for ending a cell phone conversation?) than the passengers on that end of the train broke into applause.</p>
        <p>Unaware that she had made a fool of herself, she looked up and asked, ''What were they clapping about?''</p>
        <p>As my children would say: ''Duh.''</p>
        <p>MITCHELL BLUMENTHAL</p>
        <p>PLEASE?!</p>
        <p>Deafened by the chat-and-chatter  All my toleration melts.  If those cell phones really matter  Can't they cell them somewhere else.</p>
        <p>MAUREEN CANNON</p>
        <p>Wearing one of my flamboyant golf outfits -- peppermint-striped shorts with matching knee socks, rainbow shirt and Panama hat -- I walked into my grandchildren's house.</p>
        <p>Kyleigh, 4 years old, glanced at me, then returned to her coloring book.</p>
        <p>''Who's that?'' called my daughter-in-law, Nayna, from another room.</p>
        <p>''It's only Pop-Pop,'' she replied dryly, ''in one of his clown suits.''</p>
        <p>JAMES CARNEY</p>
        <p>No sooner had I stopped for a red light on Route 46 in Parsippany than a truck driver in the next lane rolls down his window and waves. I don't think I know him. Still, I do the courteous thing and wave back.</p>
        <p>Well, he waves harder.</p>
        <p>I wave harder.</p>
        <p>A bee flies out his window. The light changes. He rolls up his window and drives off.</p>
        <p>AUDREY CORN</p>
        <p>With the end of the school year fast approaching and final exam time here, I'm reminded of an incident that occurred when I was teaching in a New Jersey high school.</p>
        <p>While grading the exam of a rather below-average student, I was amazed at the accuracy of his answers. Though suspicious that he had somehow gained access to my answer key, I was hesitant to accuse him of cheating without any proof.</p>
        <p>Then the smoking gun appeared.</p>
        <p>When I reached the last question, I saw the student had written, ''Answers will vary.''</p>

        <p>Didn't fall for the Florio line,</p>
        <p>Preferring big spender Corzine</p>
        <p>(Who has blown scads and scads</p>
        <p>Of his money on ads)</p>
        <p>To the guy who preferred spending mine.</p>
