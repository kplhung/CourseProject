        <p>Just three days ago, this season's Stanley Cup finals seemed likely to be remembered as another ho-hum series that failed to live up to the hype.</p>
        <p>What a difference sudden death can make.</p>
        <p>The Dallas Stars played parts of the last three days a goal away from extinction. But tonight, after 28 minutes 20 seconds of tension-filled overtime, the Devils, on Jason Arnott's series-clinching goal, won their second Stanley Cup.</p>
        <p>Starting with Game 5 on Thursday night, the last two games have transformed the series from a one-sided affair into an battle of epic proportions, one that spanned three consecutive days.</p>
        <p>Tonight marked the first time consecutive games in the final had gone into overtime since 1951, when Toronto defeated Montreal, four games to one, and all five games went into overtime.</p>
        <p>The teams played Thursday night into Friday morning in New Jersey. They returned here for Game 5, which began Saturday night and nearly crept into Sunday morning here.</p>
        <p>Mike Modano saved the series for Dallas at 46 minutes 21 seconds of overtime in Game 5. But Arnott ended things 8:20 into the second overtime in Game 6 tonight.</p>
        <p>And so a series that opened with a 7-3 New Jersey rout in Game 1 is now destined to be remembered for the electricity of sudden-death overtime. Make that all of its overtimes.</p>
        <p>There have been five overtimes in all over the last three days. The final scores -- a 1-0 Dallas victory in three overtimes on Thursday; a 2-1 Devils' victory in two overtimes tonight -- would seem to suggest tight-checking defensive struggles with few offensive chances.</p>
        <p>They were anything but.</p>
        <p>In Game 5, the series turned into a battle of wills. On one side were the defending Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars, trying to climb out of a desperate position, trailing three games to one.</p>
        <p>On the other side were the upstart Devils, trying desperately not to squander their advantage, a deficit that they themselves had somehow come back from in the conference finals against the Philadelphia Flyers to advance to the championship round.</p>
        <p>And on both sides there was brilliant goaltending, from Ed Belfour of Dallas and Martin Brodeur of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Without Belfour's heroics in Game 5, when he made 48 sparkling saves, the Stars would have relinquished the cup in New Jersey. Brodeur, who made 40 saves until Modano redirected a Brett Hull pass through his legs at 1:11 a.m. Friday in New Jersey was nearly as good.</p>
        <p>But overtime had rarely been kind to Brodeur in the playoffs. In his career, Brodeur was 3-11 in playoff overtime before tonight's game.</p>
        <p>In 1994, he was on the wrong end of two unforgettable games. He was in the goal for a 1-0 loss to Dominik Hasek and the Sabres in four overtimes in Buffalo in the first round of the playoffs that extended the series to seven games. And then, that same year, he played in a devastating 2-1 loss in double overtime at Madison Square Garden in the seventh game of the Eastern Conference finals; that game will be remembered for the Ranger radio announcer Howie Rose's call of ''Matteau! Matteau! Matteau!''</p>
        <p>This series will be remembered for something different: two incredibly exhausting nights of overtime that finally ended with Arnott's goal.</p>
