        <p>When most people think of sports here, rowing does not spring to mind. Think again.</p>
        <p>The straight and calm Cooper River -- which flows through Collingswood, Pennsauken and Cherry Hill as well as Camden -- is a mecca of rowing in the United States. And for the last three weeks, the course has been the home for the women's and men's intercollegiate championships and, ending today, the 2000 USRowing Olympic team trials.</p>
        <p>''It's a wonderful place,'' said Jody Pope, the events manager for USRowing, the official governing body of the sport. ''There is little that can match the Cooper River.''</p>
        <p>Rowing has a long history in neighboring Philadelphia, home of such Olympic rowers as John B. Kelly, father of the late Princess Grace of Monaco, and her brother John Jr., and clubs with names like Vesper and Undine and their ornate Victorian boathouses along the Schuylkill.</p>
        <p>But while the Schuylkill hosts some nice weekend events, the workmanlike Cooper is doing the biggies.</p>
        <p>Over Memorial Day weekend, the women's National Collegiate Athletic Association collegiate championships were on the river. Last weekend, it was the Intercollegiate Rowing Association championships -- the N.C.A.A. does not sanction men's rowing, so the winners of the intercollegiate event are essentially the national collegiate championships. The past several days -- including today -- rowers have been qualifying for 9 of the 14 Olympic events (the remainder will be held on Lake Carnegie in Princeton on Aug. 9 through 14).</p>
        <p>How has the otherwise undistinguished Cooper become the river of choice for the country's rowing community.</p>
        <p>''It is what is called a fair course,'' said Brett Johnson, a USRowing spokesman. ''It is a good course in terms of having relatively flat water.  There is no current, so it is fair for everyone. And Philadelphia is obviously a strong rowing community, so it's a nice place to have an event.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson explained that it was important to race on a course where there could be six lanes across with equal conditions. Because normal weather conditions and the tree-lined topography of the banks of the Cooper along the 2,000-meter course create little wind, no one in any of the six lanes gains an advantage.</p>
        <p>''There's a beautiful course in Syracuse, for instance,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''But it's on a lake and there is often a good wind, so it's not a fair course. The Schuylkill and the Charles, in Boston, tend to bend, so they don't really have a good 2,000-meter straightaway.</p>
        <p>''Lake Carnegie in Princeton tends not to be good for six-lane racing,'' he continued. ''The Cooper is one of only a few places that fills all the bills.''</p>
        <p>Al Wachlin, a member of the Cooper River Rowing Association, is the volunteer caretaker of the course, making sure the lane markers and buoys are in the right places and that the competitors enjoy themselves.</p>
        <p>''The I.R.A.'s discovered the secret of the Cooper River about eight or nine years ago when the lake in Syracuse was flooded,'' he said, noting that the intercollegiate championships are now held in Camden every year. ''It's just a great course. And it's one of the few in the East where you can watch the entire race from the banks.''</p>
        <p>For the last few weeks, collegians from around the country filled the waters -- and the hotels -- in South Jersey. The University of Washington, Stanford University, University of California at Berkeley, Ohio State University and many other big schools set up tents, sold souvenirs  and brought family and friends to cheer along the banks of the Cooper.</p>
        <p>''It's a nice thing for us,'' said Bob White, the general manager of the Cherry Hill Hilton, which is only a few hundred yards from the rowing finish line.</p>
        <p>But many of the competitors for Olympic spots drove only about 40 miles because Princeton is one of three rowing training centers around the country (the others are in Gainesville, Ga., and San Diego). Many of the competitors in the ''sweep'' events -- in which the rower has two hands on one oar, as opposed to rowing with two oars, which is called sculling -- train with a former Princeton University coach, Mike Teti.</p>
        <p>''Part of the reason it's there, besides Coach Teti, is because it is a good place to find jobs,'' said Ms. Pope of USRowing, which has its headquarters in Indianapolis along with several other amateur sports organizations. ''You're not going to make money rowing, so you'd better be working while you are training. We like coming to the Cooper, though. Any time you find a fair course, rowers love it.''</p>
