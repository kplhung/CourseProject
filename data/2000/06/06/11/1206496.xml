        <p>WITH crime down, the streets of New York are safer than they have been in years. And to the casual eye, it may seem as if the city's fraud artists, who traditionally choose the warmer months in which to ply their trade, have all but disappeared from the streets.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration's crackdown on low-level quality of life offenders seems to have had a chilling effect on the more traditional street swindlers. Although they still exist, their numbers have decreased substantially, especially in Midtown.</p>
        <p>''The old con games seem to have dried up,'' said Tom Cusick, president of the Fifth Avenue Association. Gone, he said, are the fraudulent card players, the phony ''going out of business'' sales and the glaziers who offered their business cards to store owners by day after breaking their windows by night. Gone, too, are the ''ketchup brigades,'' thieves who spilled substances on unsuspecting tourists, distracting them while confederates picked their pockets.</p>
        <p>But although there appear to be fewer con artists around, they are far from extinct.  While it may be more of a challenge to find three-card monte players on the street corners of Midtown Manhattan, thieves are as resilient as the crocuses that sprout in junk-filled lots. With the city's large number of tourists, there are an increasing number of tempting targets.</p>
        <p>And because swindlers are quick to pick up on the latest trends, technological and otherwise, there seem to be an unending supply of new and devious ways to take advantage of trusting people.</p>
        <p>One of the newest tricks, and one of the more imaginative, in that it lets thieves take advantage of a once-in-a-decade opportunity, involves the United States Census. Jane S. Hoffman, the commissioner of the city's Department of Consumer Affairs, said her office recently uncovered a scheme in which self-proclaimed census workers telephoned unsuspecting victims and requested a whole range of personal information, including Social Security numbers.</p>
        <p>The callers try to encourage their victims to talk by saying they merely want to confirm data the government has already received in writing. If the victim complies, the caller politely says goodbye. But if the prospective victim demurs, he or she is transferred to a ''supervisor,'' an accomplice who repeats the pitch in a second effort to obtain the information.</p>
        <p>What do the thieves do with the information?</p>
        <p>Plenty, according to Ms. Hoffman. They are perpetrators of so-called identity theft, who obtain personal information and use it to get credit cards or to make fraudulent purchases, often on the Internet.</p>
        <p>''We know of at least 10 such incidents,'' Ms. Hoffman said, ''all of them in the city.''</p>
        <p>Her agency learned of the fraudulent calls  when people hung up on the fake census workers and called her office to complain.  But as for others who fell for the ruse, it will take weeks for her office to learn about them, since victims will call only after discovering that fraudulent purchases have been charged to their accounts.</p>
        <p>THE census fraud primarily involves the elderly, who are targets because they are more likely to divulge personal information in response to an insistent voice. Pat Cohen of the city's Consumer Affairs Department said the thieves get the phone numbers from telemarketers  who have subscription lists for magazines  and mail-order lists for medical products for the elderly.</p>
        <p>Another new fraud was inspired by the technology that allows subway riders to buy MetroCards in vending machines.</p>
        <p>One recent victim, Laura Leston of Manhattan, a marketing consultant from TriBeCa, learned how this trick worked after her wallet was stolen from her pocketbook when she was heading downtown on the Seventh Avenue express. Her bank cards and credit cards were quickly taken to a MetroCard vending machine in the station at 14th Street and Seventh Avenue, where they were used to buy several $63 MetroCards, each good for one month's unlimited travel.</p>
        <p>Ms. Leston discovered what had happened when she reported the theft at her bank. She also learned something else that she had never known about the shiny new MetroCard vending machines, which started appearing in subway stations 18 months ago: customers do not have to put in personal identification numbers for transactions using credit cards, bank debit cards or cash cards with the MasterCard or Visa logo. A customer -- or a thief -- can instruct the machines to treat these cards as if they were ordinary credit cards.</p>
        <p>Officials of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority admitted that fraudulent card use has occurred at some MetroCard machines, but they would not provide details about the number or location of incidents. There are 675 vending machines at present, and all the city's 468 subway stations are supposed to get the machines within the next few years.</p>
        <p>''There are millions of transactions daily,'' said Tom Kelly, an M.T.A. spokesman. ''As far as I know, it's not a major problem,  but a concern.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly declined to speculate about how the ill-gotten MetroCards might have been used. But Ms. Leston said a police officer investigating her case told her that the culprits hawk the cards at a discount outside subway stations.</p>
        <p>Another swindle has an ''only in New York'' quality, perhaps because New York is one place where residents will happily sit still for overpriced takeout food. In this one,  a person carrying a salad bar container will stroll through a subway station or other crowded place. Intentionally bumping into a passer-by, the cheat will drop the container and the contents will spill out. He or she will claim the victim caused the mishap and demand reimbursement for the lost meal.</p>
        <p>The container, possibly fished out of a trash can, may have housed no more than a few tired pieces of lettuce. But there will often be a sticker price on it of several dollars, the amount the trickster wants the mark to fork over.</p>
