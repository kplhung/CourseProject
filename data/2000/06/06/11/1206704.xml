        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Black immigrants from Cuba may be learning painful lessons from their experiences in the United States, but they are also teaching us a great deal (front page, June 5).</p>
        <p>People from a wide range of countries -- Iraq, Peru, Lebanon, Brazil, Syria and Colombia, to name just a few -- are startled to find that in this country their physical attributes may cause them to be mistaken for African-American. We learn from these immigrants that people from all over the world resemble people we have been taught to think of as ''black.'' They learn quickly to distinguish themselves from African-Americans in order to get ahead.</p>
