        <p>MORELS epitomize spring fever. People who love these mushrooms, with their earthy, woodsy taste, will happily pay $40 a pound or more for them.

        <p>MORELS epitomize spring fever. People who love these mushrooms, with their earthy, woodsy taste, will happily pay $40 a pound or more for them. They are best sauteed in butter until crispy and eaten on their own, says one friend whose eyes light up at the mere thought of them. True, but at the price morels go for these days, it's worth it to stretch a small amount by combining them with potatoes or pasta, which will carry their flavor without competing with it.</p>
        <p>In the United States there are five different species of morels, and most of them are grown in California, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin. They vary in flavor according to where they come from or where they have been grown, but the crop is never a sure one and no one knows exactly what affects their quality.</p>
        <p>The mushrooms may be dark brown, yellow or ivory colored, and they have pitted caps.</p>
        <p>They can be gritty and should be washed quickly under cold running water, which will evaporate during cooking.</p>
        <p>Morels go with spring vegetables like asparagus, new potatoes and young garlic, and with delicate meats like chicken and veal. They may be expensive, but they are one of the few truly seasonal foods left -- and all the more desired for it.</p>
        <p>Chicken Cutlets With Asparagus and Morels  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>2 chicken cutlets (1 whole boneless chicken breast pounded flat)  1 lemon  Freshly ground pepper to taste  2 tablespoons fresh tarragon  4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <p>3/4 pound Yukon gold potatoes  8 asparagus spears, cut in 1-inch pieces on the bias  4 ounces morels  1 tablespoon unsalted butter  2 shallots, finely chopped  1 clove garlic, minced  Coarse sea salt to taste  Sprigs of tarragon to garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Pat the chicken cutlets dry with a paper towel. Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice of one half onto both sides of the cutlets. Season them with pepper and sprinkle with tarragon and a tablespoon of olive oil. Set them aside.</p>
        <p>2. Cut the potatoes into large cubes and steam them until barely tender.</p>
        <p>3. Heat two tablespoons of olive oil in a large frying pan (preferably cast iron). Season the potatoes with salt and pepper and saute them on all sides until golden brown.</p>
        <p>4. Meanwhile, steam the asparagus until tender. Rinse the morels and cut them in half if they are small, or in thick slices if they are large.  Heat the butter and a tablespoon of olive oil in a separate pan and add the shallots, garlic and morels. Season them with salt and pepper and saute them until they have exuded their juice and become crisp. Add the potatoes and asparagus to the pan and keep it warm over a low flame while you cook the chicken.</p>
        <p>5. Wipe out the frying pan used for the potatoes with a paper towel. Replace over the heat and, when it is hot, add the chicken breasts. Saute them for three to four minutes on each side, until golden brown and no longer pink in the middle. Divide them among two heated plates, add the potato-morel mixture and garnish with remaining lemon half, cut into quarters, and sprigs of tarragon.  Yield: 2 servings.</p>
        <p>Morels With New Potatoes And Bacon  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>1 pound small new, fingerling or Yukon Gold potatoes  2 ounces slab bacon, cut into lardons  1 small onion  3 tablespoons olive oil  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  6 ounces morels  1 tablespoon unsalted butter  2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley.</p>
        <p>1. Cut the potatoes into large chunks and steam them until barely tender. Drain. Put the bacon in a small frying pan and cook until the lardons are browned and crisp. Keep them warm over a low flame.</p>
        <p>2. Slice the onion. Heat two tablespoons olive oil in a large frying pan (preferably cast iron). Season the potatoes with salt and pepper. When they are starting to brown, add the onion and continue cooking until the onion starts to caramelize.</p>
        <p>3. Meanwhile, rinse the morels and cut them in half if they are large; leave whole if small. Heat the butter and remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a separate pan and add the morels. Season them with salt and pepper and saute them until they have exuded their juice and become crisp. Add them to the potatoes with the lardons. Mix together, correct seasoning and sprinkle with parsley.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Creamed Morels With Linguine  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>1 pound linguine</p>
        <p>1/2 pound morels  2 tablespoons butter  1 tablespoon olive oil  2 shallots, sliced  1 clove garlic, minced  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1/4 cup heavy cream or creme fraiche  2 tablespoons fresh tarragon.</p>
        <p>1. Bring six quarts salted water to boil for the linguine.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, rinse the morels and cut them in half if they are small or in thick slices if they are large. Heat the butter and a tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan and add the shallots, garlic and morels. Season them with salt and pepper and saute them until the morels have exuded their juice and become crisp. Meanwhile, cook the linguine until al dente.</p>
        <p>5. Add the heavy cream and tarragon to the morels. Bring to boil. Drain the linguine and put it in a heated bowl. Add the morel mixture and toss. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
