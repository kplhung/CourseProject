        <p>Nobody in the Mets' clubhouse -- not the manager, the general manager, the pitching coach or the pitcher himself -- will say he is too concerned about Bobby J. Jones.</p>
        <p>The right-hander gave up seven runs on nine hits in four and two-thirds innings yesterday in a 13-5 loss to the Yankees, who were expected to hit him hard and did. He is 1-3 with a 10.19 earned run average in eight starts, and he has allowed at least as many hits as innings pitched every time out.</p>
        <p>Because of off days, the Mets can go with a four-man rotation for their next 10 games, with all of their starters getting at least the usual four days' rest. Even so, Manager Bobby Valentine said Jones was likely to make his next start on Saturday in Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>''It seems like that's the case, yeah,'' Valentine said. ''He's pitched well in the past, and we're waiting to see that spark here this year. We haven't seen it yet. I try and stay as confident as I can in all my players.''</p>
        <p>Jones, too, says he is remaining confident. When he takes the mound, he believes he is every bit the pitcher who struck out Ken Griffey Jr. and Mark McGwire in the 1997 All-Star Game.</p>
        <p>''I don't show emotion on the mound, but I have that burning desire inside of me that's telling me that I'm the best out there, and my stuff's going to get people out,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>Jones said he was happy with his pitches yesterday and that he had good life on his fastball, one of his best changeups of the season and a curveball that was drastically improved from his last start. But through the first three innings, the Yankees swung and missed at only 2 of his 47 pitches.</p>
        <p>If the pitches were good, the results were not.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the stats truly dictate what happened,'' the pitching coach Dave Wallace said. ''There was progress.''</p>
        <p>With two outs in the first inning, Bernie Williams sliced a breaking ball down the left-field line for a run-scoring double. Tino Martinez then hit a slow curve.</p>
        <p>Right fielder Derek Bell, who was playing Martinez to pull and also said he may have lost the ball in the white T-shirts in the stands, let the ball fall in for a double.</p>
        <p>General Manager Steve Phillips pointed to those hits when he said he was not disappointed in Jones's outing. ''It would have been better if he had gotten through five,'' Phillips said. ''That doesn't mean next time he won't be able to go deeper in the game.''</p>
        <p>Jones has not lasted more than six innings all season, but Phillips said he did not expect any changes in the starting rotation based on yesterday's game, and Valentine, in a way,  supported that view.</p>
        <p>''Before you even think about any moves, the alternatives would have to be presented,'' Valentine said. ''I haven't had any alternatives presented.''</p>
        <p>Jones, who missed most of last year with bursitis in his shoulder, could be skipped until June 24, working out of the bullpen and getting a chance to concentrate on his problems. But he has already been given that chance; Jones made two rehab starts while coming back from a calf strain in mid-April that put him on the disabled list.</p>
        <p>The Class AAA right-hander Grant Roberts is a pivotal figure as the Mets determine their next move. The Mets had hoped Roberts could be this year's Octavio Dotel, who was summoned midway through last season and went 8-3. Roberts has pitched well -- he is 4-3 with a 4.31 earned run average -- but he has not shown the poise the Mets would like.</p>
        <p>After Roberts, the next pitcher in line, is the left-handed Bobby M. Jones, who was acquired in a trade for Masato Yoshii. He has pitched well lately and has major league experience.</p>
        <p>Roberts -- or the left-handed Jones -- could be used to obtain a veteran starter, and the Mets are keeping tabs on the pitchers who may become available..</p>
        <p>Philadelphia is still trying to sign Andy Ashby, and Minnesota wants to do the same with Brad Radke, two potential free agents who interest the Mets. The Mets have also inquired about Seattle's John Halama and Brett Tomko.</p>
        <p>Jones is not paying attention to the speculation about the rotation. Only Valentine's opinion matters, he said.</p>
        <p>In the course of preparing for his next start, Jones will ask himself what went wrong yesterday -- what has gone wrong all year -- and the answers might not be there.</p>
        <p>''I ain't going to lie to you, it's frustrating,'' Jones said. ''It's not fun going out there and having your good stuff and having those big innings on you. But I can't do nothing about it now.''  BASEBALL</p>
