        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Peter Applebome's ''Memphis-on-Hudson?'' [County Lines, June 4] is right on target. However, aside from Manhattan, Brooklyn and Bronx emigres, he overlooks one group that has invaded northern Westchester en masse: Long Islanders. In my community, I've lost track of the number of families who are (1) from Long Island and (2) have at least one spouse who's a lawyer. (I honestly believe there's a huge factory, somewhere beyond Syosset, which does nothing but churn out these families.) When I've queried members of this group as to why they did not remain on Long Island, I always receive the same response: ''too much traffic.''</p>
