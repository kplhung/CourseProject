        <p>THREE small shows at the Yale Art Gallery in New Haven have a larger import than their compactness would indicate. They make their points concisely, but precisely and suggestively, and thereby stimulate big thoughts.</p>
        <p>''Dance of the Dragon: Fabulous Beasts in Asian Art'' is another in a series of theme exhibitions that highlight relationships among objects in Yale's collection of Eastern art. The dragon is the creature that comes most quickly to mind in the pantheon of fabulous animals, the subject of the show.</p>
        <p>But what captivates viewers immediately are several Chinese earthenware horses dating from the Tang dynasty (A.D. 618-907).</p>
        <p>Some explanation is needed for the horse's presence in the show, because the horse, an actual animal, would not seem to have much of the fabulous about it. Printed information informs us that the horse was believed to be a relative of the dragon and ''akin to the mysterious powers of water.'' The animals in the show, though seemingly viral, all have streamlined contours and such stylization might indicate qualities above the mundane.</p>
        <p>As might be expected, tomb guardian creatures are meant to straddle both the earthly and spiritual realms. They are often frightening, as they would have to be to do their job. A couple of them are truly monstrous, with spiky protrusions and wide-open mouths that would emit a paralyzing roar. What is especially surprising is that other tomb guardians had opposite characteristics; soft, benevolent faces are powerfully attractive and evil might melt in the face of such spirits.</p>
        <p>The show's drawing card, the dragons, are for the most part less imposing than the horses or the guardians.</p>
        <p>One reason is that the dragon is a benevolent force in Chinese culture, and its curves and coils lend themselves to stylized decoration. Dragons don't dominate their settings -- which are two-dimensional for the most part -- as much they harmoniously inform them. When dragons appear on an elaborate robe, for instance, it is the whole garment that dazzles. The lore associated with them dictates the decorative schemes of the robes and other objects, but by spreading themselves so widely the dragons become less palpable beasts than static, artful symbols.</p>
        <p>''Imaging African Art'' considers how African art has stimulated American artists. Photography dominates the show but in different ways. Objects from African culture are presented in straight photographs, but they also appear in conceptual work rooted in photography. Walker Evans, who is best known for photographing the American scene during the Depression, makes an absorbing complement to Charles Sheeler, a major exponent of Precisionism, the painting style that emphasized clean lines. Each man is represented by groupings of pictures of what are African sculpture and other objects.</p>
        <p>Superficially, the approach taken by the two artists seems similar, Sheeler's work dates from 1916-18, while Evans made his photographs in the mid-1930's. True to his penchant for emphatic line, largely inspired by the crisp, sharp look of the growing industrial landscape, Sheeler photographed masks and other objects that are distinguished by precise contours. On the other hand, Evans favored items that seem more animated, such as masks with raffia or broom-like fly whisks.</p>
        <p>These vintage photographs are quiescent when compared to more recent art deliberately made to discomfit its audience. Lorna Simpson's ''Wigs'' is a grid of images of hairstyles printed on felt. Many of the styles are African in origin. The work is blurry on purpose; its message is that hair is a surrogate for personal identity, but it's an imperfect and misleading indicator.</p>
        <p>This work seems labored, however, in company with the precise intentions of Carrie Mae Weems who photographed structures that are still extant on what is known as the Slave Coast of West Africa. Several insistent dark and narrow confines themselves are horrific.</p>
        <p>A related triptych at the show's entrance is composed of a black-and-white photograph of a close grouping of African sculptures flanked by hypnotic images of bright blue water. The viewer can't escape completing the frightful narrative.</p>
        <p>Other artists in the exhibition are more sparsely presented. They include historical figures like Romare Bearden, Wilmer Angier Jennings, Lois Mailou Jones and Hale Woodruff along with the contemporary artists Joy Gregory, Barry Le Va, Albert Chong and Moira Pernambuco.</p>
        <p>Philip Guston's example dominated the final decades of 20th-century painting and it continues to inspire young artists. Guston began his career as an earnest social realist painter in the 1930's, and later became an Abstract Expressionist. In 1968 he began a controversial return to figuration, albeit with a riveting cartoony look. Few careers have had such a neat a-b-a rhythm.</p>
        <p>A couple of his large Abstract Expressionist canvases are included in the show ''Philip Guston: A New Alphabet.'' They are unusual combinations of gray, black and pink and painted with sweeping gestures. They seem incomplete, as if they were waiting for something. That something is presented in nuggets, 27 small paintings dating from 1969 and 1970, stacked in three rows. They're the alphabet of the show's title, and each bears a representative image from Guston's large vocabulary of symbols that are also things.</p>
        <p>The soles of a pair of shoes with each nail articulated, a cup of especially black coffee and the back of a young man's head are among objects from daily life, but two pyramid shapes with eyes represent what became a central, disturbing motif for Guston, the Ku Klux Klan. Guston had painted Klansmen in the 1930's as frightening specters. In the reincarnation they are ludicrous but nevertheless dangerous.</p>
        <p>In an accompanying large painting, ''Riding Around,'' their robes are blood-spattered. Other large works round out the show; they are about life on the street, and life in the studio, Guston's compelling blend of public and private.</p>
        <p>The three exhibitions are at the Yale University Art Gallery through July 30.</p>
