        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio's ''Mainstream Express'' did not exactly roar into Westchester. It was more like a crawl, as the Senate candidate got a look at the county's traffic problems. His bus got caught in a jam on the Tappan Zee Bridge, and then crept along Interstate 287, delaying Mr. Lazio's arrival at a Harbor Island Park rally. Then, in Mamaroneck, the bus was too tall to clear a bridge so staffers packed him and some reporters into vans and headed for the rally. A spokesman, Dan McLagan, said that while Mr. Lazio may suffer from traffic problems, he does not cause them like his rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has caused slowdowns during visits to Manhattan and Chappaqua.</p>
