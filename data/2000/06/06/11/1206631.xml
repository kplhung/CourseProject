        <p>Wall Street's sidelines are becoming more crowded these days as investors grow reluctant to make major decisions because of concerns about the direction of interest rates and the economy.</p>
        <p>''Trading volume is very low,'' noted Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons. ''And there's a lot of cash on the sidelines.''</p>
        <p>Some investors worry that the steady increase in rates by the Federal Reserve will cause an economic slowdown, which could hurt the profits of many companies. Especially vulnerable are retailers, and shares of several companies declined last week, including the stock of Wal-Mart Stores. Also falling was Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products giant. It said fiscal fourth-quarter earnings would be flat, and its chief executive resigned.</p>
        <p>The technology sector fared better despite the ruling by a federal judge to split up Microsoft. Among the winners was I.B.M., which rose after analysts predicted that the company would have a good year</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 10,614.06, down 180.70, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 61.46, to 3,874.84.</p>
