        <p>Walter Kirn comment on downside of new technology like holographic video conferencing, which would allow him to meet with his agent in New York, but also give his agent a close look at laundry day at Kirn farm in Montana; regrets that regional distinctions will also disappear as technology triumphs over geography (M)</p>

        <p>Somehow the future always disappoints me. Though it consistently brings such helpful novelties as wireless e-mail and canned flat-tire sealant, it never delivers the fundamental breakthroughs I pined for as a boy: time travel, X-ray vision and personal antigravity units. Yes, it's nice to able to trade stocks at any hour from a moving vehicle, but it's not the stuff of childhood wishes. There's one fantasy from my youth, however, that may be realized before the decade ends: the ability to be two places at once, to travel almost instantly through space.</p>
        <p>''The dream,'' says Prof. Stephen Benton, head of the Spatial Imaging Group at M.I.T.'s Media Laboratory, ''is that you'd have a wall of your office that would disappear and you'd see another office behind it. You'd see people at a table, and you'd be at the table.'' The technology in question, called holographic video conferencing, would resemble, says Benton, ''HDTV plus depth'' and allow for ''the communication of presence.'' Benton has a working prototype up and running in his laboratory, and within the next 10 to 20 years, he believes it will be possible for a family whose members are scattered across the country to share a virtual Thanksgiving, say, clinking ethereal wineglasses through the void.</p>

        <p>Somehow the future always disappoints me. Though it consistently brings such helpful novelties as wireless e-mail and canned flat-tire sealant, it never delivers the fundamental breakthroughs I pined for as a boy: time travel, X-ray vision and personal antigravity units. Yes, it's nice to able to trade stocks at any hour from a moving vehicle, but it's not the stuff of childhood wishes. There's one fantasy from my youth, however, that may be realized before the decade ends: the ability to be two places at once, to travel almost instantly through space.</p>
        <p>''The dream,'' says Prof. Stephen Benton, head of the Spatial Imaging Group at M.I.T.'s Media Laboratory, ''is that you'd have a wall of your office that would disappear and you'd see another office behind it. You'd see people at a table, and you'd be at the table.'' The technology in question, called holographic video conferencing, would resemble, says Benton, ''HDTV plus depth'' and allow for ''the communication of presence.'' Benton has a working prototype up and running in his laboratory, and within the next 10 to 20 years, he believes it will be possible for a family whose members are scattered across the country to share a virtual Thanksgiving, say, clinking ethereal wineglasses through the void.</p>
        <p>With all of the tension and bickering but none of the good smells, holographic holiday feasts may or may not catch on. Still, the basic technology appeals to me. As a writer who lives in Montana but does most of his business in New York, I'd love to be able to meet with my agent and show my face around the hot spots without having to fly five hours each way. I picture my shimmering holographic image, sitting across from editors in chief, pitching stories and demanding raises. I picture it manifesting unannounced, rather like the Ghost of Christmas Past, in the hotel rooms of female movie stars whose unlisted holographic ''addresses'' I've managed to look up on the Internet.</p>
        <p>What I don't like to picture is this whole process working in reverse. It's laundry day at the Kirn farm. Washed and unwashed novelty boxer shorts hang on chair backs and lie heaped on tables. I am wearing my only clean clothes: a crotch-hugging nylon swimsuit and a Judas Priest T-shirt from my high school days. Suddenly, a bell rings, and without thinking, I flip the answer switch. Then I freeze. There stands my boss, as large as life. Her virtual gaze takes in my home, my wardrobe. . . .</p>
        <p>That's the problem with brilliant innovations -- the freedom they offer rapidly diminishes as other people besides you adopt them. Being the only person with a car would be utter bliss; being one of 300 million is a drag. The same goes for holographic video conferencing. Although it's unclear whether people's holograms would really be able to drop in on one another, my fantasy of relaxing in Montana while cutting a swath through Gotham would have a price: millions of disembodied Gothamites cutting a swath through Montana. My adopted state would be a hideout no more, my distance from the major population centers no longer a form of psychic insulation.</p>
        <p>And consider the broader, long-term ramifications of this coming triumph over geography. Regional differences will erode, or vanish. Shocking performance-art pieces from SoHo will be available, live, in rural Wyoming, while back in SoHo audiences will thrill to majestic eruptions of Old Faithful. This loss of regional distinctions will trouble travel writers and anthropology students, but it will delight, for the most part, the residents of the regions themselves. In Montana, which lacks a single Banana Republic store and where ''art'' is still synonymous with mantel-size paintings of battling bull elk, people can't wait to live like everyone else.</p>
        <p>Except for me, that is. I treasure my geographical isolation; it gives me peace to work and dream and fish. (Come to think of it, just two activities will remain forever out of range of high-definition holography: catching trout and eating from buffets.) That's just my tough luck, though, I guess. As a boy, I longed to be everywhere at once, not understanding that this would be the same as being nowhere in particular.</p>
