        <p>Travis Fryman's second homer of the game triggered Cleveland's three-homer barrage in the sixth inning yesterday, sending the Indians to a 6-5 victory over the visiting Cincinnati Reds, who dropped their fifth straight.</p>
        <p>Fryman's leadoff homer in the sixth against Steve Parris (2-9) was followed by one from Russell Branyan as the Indians tied the game at 5-5. Kenny Lofton homered with two outs as Cleveland won for the seventh time in eight games.</p>
        <p>Dave Burba (7-1) won his sixth straight decision, allowing five runs and six hits in six innings. He hasn't lost in his last 10 starts.</p>
        <p>Ken Griffey Jr. and Michael Tucker each hit two-run homers for the slumping Reds, who have dropped 9 of 13.</p>
        <p>The Indians made several sparkling defensive plays, none bigger than David Justice throwing out Griffey trying to stretch a single in the seventh for the second out.</p>
        <p>With the tying run at first, Griffey hit a ball into the right-field corner but didn't accelerate until rounding first. The Reds ended up stranding the tying run at third.</p>
        <p>Griffey put the Reds up, 2-0, with his 17th homer, a towering two-run shot into the right-field stands. It was Griffey's 415th career homer, putting him into 27th place on the all-time list.</p>
        <p>WHITE SOX 4, CUBS 3: Kerry Wood walked seven and gave up four runs as the host White Sox, helped by a timely pickoff, beat the Cubs for their sixth straight victory.</p>
        <p>Magglio Ordonez hit a two-run homer, and Carlos Lee and Herbert Perry drove in the other runs for the White Sox.</p>
        <p>The Cubs closed to 4-3 in the eighth when Augie Ojeda scored on Mark Grace's force-play grounder. But with Sammy Sosa at the plate and runners at the corners, Grace was picked off first by the reliever Sean Lowe to end the inning.</p>
        <p>Grace hit a solo homer in the sixth, his first since returning from the disabled list June 1.</p>
        <p>Mike Sirotka (5-5) gave up three runs and six hits in seven-plus innings. Keith Foulke pitched a perfect ninth for his 14th save in 16 chances.</p>
        <p>The White Sox are one victory away from a second sweep in as many years of their crosstown rivals. The White Sox took all three games at Wrigley Field last year.</p>
        <p>The White Sox lead the American League with a 37-23 record, the second-best mark in the majors behind Atlanta.</p>
        <p>EXPOS 11, BLUE JAYS 2: The rookie Tony Armas Jr. allowed four hits in seven innings and Vladimir Guerrero homered as Montreal won in Toronto to end a three-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>Armas, traded from Boston along with Carl Pavano in the deal for Pedro Martinez in 1997, won his second straight start.</p>
        <p>Armas (2-3) has a 2.29 earned run average since being promoted from Class AAA on May 13. The 22-year-old son of the former major league outfielder Tony Armas, allowed just one run. He struck out three and walked two.</p>
        <p>Carlos Delgado hit a run-scoring double for Toronto in the fourth. Armas escaped a bases-loaded jam in the seventh by getting Alex Gonzalez to line out sharply to second baseman Jose Vidro.</p>
        <p>Kelvim Escobar (5-7) walked Wilton Guerrero to start the game, Vidro followed with a run-scoring double, Rondell White singled home a run and Vladimir Guerrero hit a two-run homer.</p>
        <p>MARLINS 5, DEVIL RAYS 1: Reid Cornelius took a no-hit bid into the seventh inning and Mike Lowell and Luis Castillo homered as Florida won in St. Petersburg.</p>
        <p>Greg Vaughn broke up Cornelius's try, lining an 0-1 pitch to left field for a single leading off the seventh.</p>
        <p>Cornelius (1-1) lost his shutout in the eighth when Felix Martinez tripled with one out and scored when Gerald Williams grounded out. The Marlins right-hander allowed three hits, walked three and threw three wild pitches in eight innings.</p>
        <p>Lowell hit a two-run homer off Esteban Yan (3-4) in the fifth and Castillo hit his first homer since Aug. 9, 1998, in the sixth off the reliever Doug Creek.</p>
        <p>TIGERS 10, CARDINALS 1: Damion Easley, Brad Ausmus and Dean Palmer homered to back Brian Moehler, as Detroit won at home over St. Louis.</p>
        <p>Mark McGwire, who has one homer since May 24, went 2 for 4 and stole his first base in nearly two years in the fourth inning. J.D. Drew homered for the Cardinals.</p>
        <p>Moehler (3-3) gave up one run and five hits with one walk and four strikeouts in seven innings.</p>
        <p>Rick Ankiel (5-3), coming off an 11-strikeout, no-walk performance in five innings against Cleveland in his previous start, wasn't as sharp against the Tigers. He gave up four runs -- two earned -- and seven hits with four walks and three strikeouts in six innings.</p>
        <p>ORIOLES 11, PHILLIES 4: Albert Belle homered and drove in four runs and Sidney Ponson pitched eight strong innings as host Baltimore beat Curt Schilling.</p>
        <p>Cal Ripken homered and drove in three runs for the Orioles, who won for only the second time in 10 games. Ripken went 3 for 4 to boost his batting average to .261, his highest since April 26.</p>
        <p>Paced by Ripken, Baltimore led, 7-1, after five innings and chased Schilling in the sixth. Belle had three hits in extending his season-high hitting streak to 12 games.</p>
        <p>Ponson (4-3) allowed five hits, two walks and four runs. He took a two-hitter into the sixth and overcame a three-run homer by Bobby Abreu to win for only the second time in nine starts.</p>
        <p>Schilling (1-4) continued to struggle as he strives to rebound from offseason surgery on his right shoulder. The right-hander allowed seven runs and 10 hits in five-plus innings.</p>
        <p>BREWERS 5, TWINS 3: Jimmy Haynes won his fourth straight road start and Marquis Grissom homered as visiting Milwaukee beat Minnesota to snap a five-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>Matthew LeCroy and Cristian Guzman homered for the Twins, who had won three straight games.</p>
        <p>Haynes (7-4) allowed two runs and six hits in seven innings to improve to 5-1 on the road. He struck out one and did not walk a batter as Milwaukee won for the first time in five interleague games. Bob Wickman pitched the ninth for his sixth save in seven opportunities.</p>
        <p>Mark Redman (4-1) lost for the first time in 20 career appearances, including eight starts. He allowed three runs and eight hits in seven innings, while striking out eight and walking two.</p>
        <p>ROYALS 2, PIRATES 1: Mac Suzuki came within one out of his first career shutout before Mike Sweeney won it for host Kansas City with a run-scoring single in the 12th.</p>
        <p>Damon hit an infield single off Jose Silva (4-2) to lead off the 12th for Kansas City. After a sacrifice bunt by Luis Ordaz, Sweeney singled to center to give Kansas City its 10th walk-off victory.</p>
        <p>Ricky Bottalico (5-1) pitched two scoreless innings to get the victory.</p>
        <p>Suzuki, making his ninth career start, allowed one run and nine hits in eight and two-third innings. He retired the first two men in the ninth before Kevin Young singled, stole second and scored on Adrian Brown's single to center.</p>
        <p>Warren Morris had a career high five hits for Pittsburgh, which stranded 13 runners. Kansas City left 12 on base.</p>
