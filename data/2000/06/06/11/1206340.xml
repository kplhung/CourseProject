        <p>THE safety of distance is one reason that would-be Broadway musicals -- the holy grail of theater -- sometimes try out 3,000 miles from their ultimate goal. Southern California is the ideal hideaway. As one New York commercial producer put it: ''Farther is better. You feel that you have more privacy. The farther away a show is, the fewer people tend to get on planes and see it and gossip about how bad it is.''</p>
        <p>These days, this area seems to be making a concerted pitch to be taken seriously as a generator of new musicals. The strip from Los Angeles to San Diego is percolating with an unusual number of musical shows, but though some preliminary reviews are in, the larger jury is still out about how well these musicals might do on Broadway, once their problems are solved. The difficulties of creating a Broadway musical hit are notorious and, with a few notable exceptions, most of those involved in the quest here do not have a track record in the field.</p>
        <p>Fifteen years ago, ''Big River'' was a hit on Broadway and its director, Des McAnuff, who had nursed it at the La Jolla Playhouse, would subsequently repeat the trick with ''The Who's Tommy'' and the revival of ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying'' starring Matthew Broderick.</p>
        <p>But the casualties have been almost as well known and include ''Elmer Gantry'' (1991) at La Jolla; ''Time and Again'' (1995) at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego; ''Buddy . . . the Buddy Holly Story'' (1997) at the San Diego Repertory Company; ''Harmony'' (1997), composed by Barry Manilow, at La Jolla, and ''What the World Needs Now'' (1998), with the music of Burt Bacharach and Hal David, at the Old Globe.</p>
        <p>This time around, the most eagerly anticipated mainstream show here is probably ''The Full Monty'' at the Old Globe, a musical stage version of the highly successful 1997 movie. The six unemployed steel mill workers who decide to become male strippers are Americans in Buffalo now, not British laborers in Sheffield, England. Yet with the exception of a handful of new characters, as well as songs and dances, the show has been designed by its American creators to adhere to the poignantly funny path of those desperate men who find friendship and strength by taking off their clothes to earn money.</p>
        <p>''When I got the call two years ago and was asked, 'What do you think about the idea of ''The Full Monty'' as a musical?' I thought, 'Oh, man, what a great idea,' '' said Jack O'Brien, the artistic director of the Old Globe, who is staging the show. The book is by the playwright Terrence McNally, who also wrote the books for the musicals ''Ragtime'' and ''Kiss of the Spider Woman''; the music and lyrics are by David Yazbek, a relative unknown.</p>
        <p>''The Full Monty'' officially opened here on June 1 and critics have called it highly commercial but flawed. ''The show's an energetic, if forgettable, crowd-pleaser,'' said Variety, with ''a strong shot at an extended Broadway run and life beyond that.'' While ''The Full Monty'' is widely expected to go to Broadway in the fall, the other shows are more offbeat and commercially risky. But depending on local reaction and that of commercial producers, they could wind up in New York someday.</p>
        <p>The productions include ''Celebration of the Lizard,'' a futuristic rock musical built around the songs of the Doors, which opened on May 28 at the San Diego Rep. The Los Angeles Times called the show a ''silly, derivative and rather sweet nostalgia trip,'' while The San Diego Union-Tribune found it ''a flat, retro show.''</p>
        <p>The third musical that recently opened, ''The Education of Randy Newman'' on June 2 at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, was more favorably received. In this show, conceived by Mr. Newman, Michael Roth and Jerry Patch, the composer-performer chronicles his life, from his boyhood in New Orleans -- where he never quite fit in -- to his career, marriage, divorce and remarriage in Los Angeles. The Hollywood Reporter found it ''a deft musical catalog that is touching, hilarious, satirical and always unmistakably Newman.'' And Variety called it an ''intelligently staged, powerfully sung revue-that's-almost-more.''</p>
        <p>A new show based on the 1967 movie musical ''Thoroughly Modern Millie,'' and using the same title, is to open this fall at the La Jolla Playhouse. With a book by Richard Morris, the author of ''The Unsinkable Molly Brown,'' and Dick Scanlon, based on Mr. Morris's original screenplay, it will have additional music by Jeanine Tesori, the composer of the Off Broadway musical ''Violet.'' The director is Michael Mayer, who recently did the revival of the musical ''You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' on Broadway.</p>
        <p>Next spring in Los Angeles, the nonprofit Center Theater Group will present a full-scale revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Flower Drum Song'' at the Ahmanson Theater, with a revised book by David Henry Hwang, the author of ''M. Butterfly'' and the recent ''Golden Child,'' both on Broadway. It will be directed and choreographed by Robert Longbottom, who directed the Broadway musicals ''Side Show'' and the revised ''Scarlet Pimpernel.''</p>
        <p>The number of shows in various states of progress is a sign not only of the built-in audiences here for musical theater but also of the continued blurring of the line between nonprofit regional houses and commercial Broadway interests. A national three-day conference on the current and future relationship between nonprofit and commercial theater in America begins on Friday at Harvard University. Critics of commercial producers who use nonprofit stages to develop work bound for Broadway argue that commercial pressures for wide audience appeal can stifle experimentation.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Brien, who has been the artistic director at the Old Globe for 19 years, is optimistic. ''San Diego was a perfect place to start this project,'' he said about ''The Full Monty.''  ''We're far enough from New York to work in a protected environment.''</p>
        <p>Certainly San Diego has been used for years as a tryout town for New York. And the Old Globe itself has nourished such Broadway-bound shows as the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical ''Into the Woods,'' the revival of ''Damn Yankees'' with Bebe Neuwirth, and Neil Simon's ''Rumors'' and ''Jake's Women.''</p>
        <p>T HE FULL MONTY'' will remain at the 600-seat Old Globe, nestled in Balboa Park, until July 9. It is expected to open in the fall on Broadway at a Jujamcyn theater at a cost of nearly $7 million, financed by Fox Searchlight, the division of 20th Century Fox that released the movie. The San Diego production cost about $2.2 million, 75 percent of that provided by the Old Globe, the rest by Fox Searchlight.</p>
        <p>''Audiences at a lot of these theaters are excited about being part of the birthing process of new plays and musicals -- they know their reaction can alter a piece,'' said Neel Keller, associate artistic director at La Jolla, where ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'' is  to open in October.</p>
        <p>Mr. Keller, who was trained on New York and Chicago stages, said that local audiences seemed committed to eclectic theater. ''Sure, they enjoy their day at the beach -- who doesn't?'' he said. ''But the sun goes down and people love that outlet of the theater.''</p>
        <p>Seated in his office at the Old Globe, Mr. O'Brien put it more bluntly: ''Twenty or 25 years ago this was a Navy town. It was a bastion of conservatism and military correctness, and it was quite sleepy. But it's not sleepy any longer. To be candid, a large number of the people now in Southern California have come from other areas and brought their own tastes, sophistication and expectations with them. We've seen an influx of technology companies like Qualcomm and Gateway. It's far more sophisticated, far more discerning. And people really enjoy theater.''</p>
        <p>TOM HALL, the producing director of the Old Globe, said the commercial enhancement money that nonprofit theaters can receive for a Broadway-bound production allows them to stage musicals they ordinarily could not afford. At the same time, the local theater has a chance to share in the profits if a show reaches Broadway and does well.</p>
        <p>A few miles from ''The Full Monty'' is the San Diego Rep's ''Celebration of the Lizard.'' This fable, set in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, is based on the music and lyrics of the rock 'n' roll icons Jim Morrison and the Doors. (The 33 songs include, of course, ''Light My Fire.'') The show, costing $750,000, the most expensive so far at the 24-year-old theater, has aroused interest among New York producers. But the price of a move to Broadway would probably be three times as much as opening the show in San Diego.</p>
        <p>''We have high hopes it will have an afterlife,'' said Sam Woodhouse, the theater's artistic director, who is staging the production.</p>
        <p>The show was conceived and adapted by Joel Lipman, 42, a television producer who said that his head has been spinning since he heard ''Light My Fire'' on a transistor radio one summer night when he was 10. A meeting in 1989 with Ray Manzarek, one of the Doors, led Mr. Lipman to return to the poetry and writings of Jim Morrison, who died in 1971. Mr. Lipman helped create the musical from a Morrison poem, ''Celebration of the Lizard,'' recorded in the late 1960's.</p>
        <p>What appealed to Mr. Lipman -- and what may give the show a life despite the reviews -- is the consistent appeal of the music of the Doors to audiences who weren't even born when the group flourished. ''There has been a steady increase in sales of their music for the last 30 years,'' Mr. Lipman said. ''Many musicians popular today -- from R.E.M. to U2 to Jon Bon Jovi -- cite the influence of the Doors. One of our hopes is that younger audiences will find a new excitement in the theater with this musical.''</p>
        <p>At South Coast Rep, Mr. Newman has used the classic autobiography ''The Education of Henry Adams'' as a model for his show, which is directed and choreographed by Myron Johnson. The composer's songs, presented by seven male and female singers, are intended to depict his personal voyage. ''It's a compilation of about 40 songs,'' Mr. Newman said. ''It's a sort of fantasy based on my life.''</p>
        <p>He added with a laugh that the public revelations of his personal life hardly bothered him. ''I would use anything I had for a song, I would make an entertainment of my life even if it were enormously lurid,'' he said. ''If I had anything to confess and get a song out of it, I'd do it. I can't keep my mouth shut.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Newman's production of ''Faust'' (he wrote the book, music and lyrics) at La Jolla in 1995 moved to the Goodman Theater in Chicago but never reached Broadway. The composer spoke happily about his theatrical experiences at La Jolla and now at South Coast Rep. ''The people are so well-trained,'' he said. ''They're terrific actors, they sing harmony, they sight-read better than I can. And they get paid practically nothing. It's ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>It was to La Jolla that the commercial Broadway producer Rocco Landesman and the set designer Heidi Ettinger, who was then his wife, brought ''Big River'' after originally working on it at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. They would also become involved with ''Into the Woods'' at the Old Globe. ''It was the first time that musicals were put into development through regional theaters,'' Mr. Landesman said recently from his office at Jujamcyn Theaters in New York, where he is the president. ''You had transfers before, but this was commercial producers coming to the theater and saying, 'We'd like to develop a musical with you.' ''</p>
        <p>''In terms of being able to see your whole production in front of an audience, it's a lot cheaper,'' he continued. ''And something which is so critical: you have the luxury of time. You can close the show and then work on it. But if you're in Boston, you have a week and then you have to be in New York. Time is the biggest luxury in developing a musical and a regional theater gives you that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Landesman was also one of the commercial producers on the musical ''Time and Again,'' based on the novel by Jack Finney, with Mr. O'Brien at the Old Globe. Despite the show's failure, Mr. Landesman said, ''I think there's a good chance that that show has a viable future.'' His long-running revue ''Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' which recently closed on Broadway, played at the Doolittle Theater in Los Angeles (part of the Center Theater Group) on its way to New York.</p>
        <p>Interest in a musical stage version of ''The Full Monty'' began almost as soon as the film was released, according to Lindsay Law, the former president of Fox Searchlight, who said he had fielded calls from theatrical producers in Europe and the United States. ''I told Fox, 'It's a valuable project, you don't want someone to make a bad musical that would tarnish the name,' '' recalled Mr. Law, who is now a producer of the show.</p>
        <p>He took the idea to Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Hall at the Old Globe -- two longtime friends. They decided to seek out Mr. McNally. ''When I called Terrence,'' Mr. O'Brien remembered, ''and told him about this project, he said, 'I would have killed you if you hadn't asked me to do it.' ''</p>
        <p>The team's major task was finding a composer. Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Law said they wanted songs that would, in the words of Mr. Law, ''not be the same ones you hear on the Broadway stage -- we wanted to bring a different sound to Broadway than what you traditionally hear.''</p>
        <p>THEY offered the job to Adam Guettel, the composer of the Off Broadway musical ''Floyd Collins.'' Mr. Guettel was intrigued but committed to several other projects. He suggested a composer-lyricist friend, Mr. Yazbek, 38, who was once a writer on the CBS show ''Late Night With David Letterman.'' Mr. Yazbek, who lives in Manhattan, has recorded two albums of his own songs, scored television shows and written songs and scripts for children's television.</p>
        <p>The producing team listened to CD's of his songs, and asked him to try out by writing several more for ''The Full Monty.'' Mr. Yazbek said he wrote three songs, two of which are still in the show.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Brien said, ''The music was energetic and edgy, male, witty and literate.''</p>
        <p>Patrick Wilson, 26, who recently appeared in the ''Encores!'' concert version of the musical ''Tenderloin'' in New York, has the main role created by Robert Carlyle in the movie. A 1995 graduate of Carnegie Mellon, Mr. Wilson also performed in ''Bright Lights Big City,'' the Paul Scott Goodman musical Off Broadway.</p>
        <p>Seated outside the Old Globe on a recent morning, awaiting the start of rehearsals, Mr. Wilson, in baggy pants and a sweatshirt, said he grew up singing in St. Petersburg, Fla., where his mother is a choir director and voice teacher and his father and brother are local television anchors. Sipping a soft drink, he said with a grin that he and the other performers were uneasy about the show's finale in which, like the film, the men remove all their clothes.</p>
        <p>''It's lit so you can't really see too much,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''I keep talking myself into it, saying, 'It's going to be fine, it's totally tasteful.' But you know as well as I do that someone in the audience is going to have a camera. And the next thing that happens is it's going to be on the Internet. And that weirds me out.''</p>
