        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Joan Ogden (Letters, May 14) challenges the statement, in a review of Thomas Cahill's ''Desire of the Everlasting Hills,'' that ''there is not a shred of historical evidence outside the Bible itself to support the existence of Jesus.'' She cites passages in Josephus, Tacitus and Lucian of Samosata. And in fact there are perhaps half a dozen other such snippets that she does not mention.</p>
        <p>Ogden should have left well enough alone: the statement she challenges is the simple truth.</p>
        <p>Lucian -- a satirist, as Ogden notes, not a historian -- wrote in the middle of the second century. His statement that the basis for the Christian sect was a man crucified in Palestine does not go beyond what second-century Christians believed. To accept him as an authority would be like accepting me as an authority for the authenticity of Ellen G. White's visions, on the basis of allusions drawn from Seventh-day Adventist literature.</p>
        <p>The passage in Tacitus'</p>
        <p>''Annals'' was written sometime after A.D. 117. It mentions followers of a religious leader named Christus, in connection with Nero's decision to use them as scapegoats for the conflagration of Rome that he himself was responsible for. Tacitus speaks of the ''great crowd'' of Christians who were thus arrested and convicted. The first trouble with this is that no modern historians think that Nero was responsible for the fire or needed scapegoats; there was hardly a ''great crowd'' of Christians in Rome in A.D. 64 anyway; and there is no independent record that Nero persecuted Christians (though Tacitus gives a most unflattering portrait of what he characterizes as the filth and criminality of Christians).</p>
        <p>The passage in Josephus is the bedrock of Christian claims for extrabiblical affirmation, but it is questionable in the extreme. Even the 11th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica remarks that the passage is either wholly or in part a fabrication. (Josephus, a Pharisee, would hardly have casually called the historical Jesus ''the anointed,'' i.e., the Messiah.) And there are other troublesome and anachronistic details. Besides -- a sort of hallmark of interpolation -- the whole passage in which the brief paragraph occurs gains in coherence if the paragraph is removed.</p>
