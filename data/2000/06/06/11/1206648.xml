        <p>Mayor Anthony Russo of Hoboken NJ, like his counterpart in New York City, is get-things-done Italian-American mayor who brooks little dissent and has weakness for mob movies, and who is battling cancer; Russo's battles with opponents on City Council are so heated that he has accused some officials who sent him get-well cards of doing so out of guilt rather than concern; Russo contends that he is energized by fights during Council meetings; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Most people here will tell you that not much is different since the mayor got cancer.</p>
        <p>The mayor, Anthony Russo, a feisty 53-year-old former schoolteacher who has ruled this bustling city of 35,000 across the river from Manhattan since 1993, may be bald. (In typically aggressive style, he shaved his head before his hair could fall out.) But he has not slowed down appreciably.</p>

        <p>Most people here will tell you that not much is different since the mayor got cancer.</p>
        <p>The mayor, Anthony Russo, a feisty 53-year-old former schoolteacher who has ruled this bustling city of 35,000 across the river from Manhattan since 1993, may be bald. (In typically aggressive style, he shaved his head before his hair could fall out.) But he has not slowed down appreciably.</p>
        <p>He signs orders, yells at his opponents on the City Council and continues negotiations to fix up the once-crumbling waterfront, which has sprouted two lovely parks and an apartment complex during his tenure. He accused some officials who sent him get-well cards of doing so out of guilt rather than concern.</p>
        <p>But to the extent that the civic climate has changed at all since late March, when Mr. Russo announced that he had just had surgery to remove a brain tumor the size of a golf ball, there is considerable disagreement about what, exactly, has happened. This is not surprising. Beneath Hoboken's ceaseless waves of gentrification lurks an old world where political grudges are nursed like kittens and shifting allegiances are monitored more closely than the Nasdaq.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russo's most devoted adversary on the City Council, Tony Soares, said the mayor had mellowed a little. ''I think he's a little more approachable now,'' Mr. Soares said recently. ''As much of a tyrant as he's been all these years, you can't help but be sympathetic.''</p>
        <p>Seconds later, though, he reversed himself. ''As much as you want to be respectful to him,'' Mr. Soares said, ''he forces you into confrontations.''</p>
        <p>Margie O'Brien, a crossing guard in the city for more than 30 years and the author of several books on Hoboken history, said that Mr. Russo's enemies had grown more vicious.</p>
        <p>''It's like the animal world,'' Ms. O'Brien, 56, said today as she waved a flock of children across 11th Street. ''If one goldfish is weak, the other goldfish go after him.''</p>
        <p>Like other events in Hoboken's fractious public life, the mayor's handling of his health problem is viewed in some quarters as part of a vast conspiracy. The mayor, some say, fabricated his entire illness to help his wife, Michele, win a seat on the school board in April. Similarly, cynics contend, the mayor, a two-pack-a-day smoker for 40 years, started giving tearful antitobacco lectures in the public schools shortly before the election to garner votes for Mrs. Russo. The mayor scoffs at such notions.</p>
        <p>Many have pointed out that while Mr. Russo has held a series of news conferences to update Hobokenites on his cancer, Ruben Ramos, 26, an opponent of Mr. Russo's on the Council who has Hodgkin's disease, has sought little publicity for his plight.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Russo, of course, life has changed utterly. Like his counterpart across the Hudson, another get-things-done Italian-American mayor who brooks little dissent and has a weakness for mob movies (Mr. Russo played a Mafioso's bodyguard in ''Analyze This''), Mr. Russo says that cancer has rearranged his priorities.</p>
        <p>''I've become more pensive, more God-fearing, more God-loving,'' Mr. Russo said in his office on the second floor of City Hall the other day. ''Maybe before I was looking for the glitz and the glitter. I would go out after government events and I would have a few drinks and flirt. And maybe this made me realize how important family is to me. My personal future and my family's future, not my political future, are what's important.''</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the mayor was tired. He had gone in for some tests the day before and he had not received the results as he had expected.</p>
        <p>''I sit and think,'' he said. ''It's constantly on my mind.''</p>
        <p>He didn't come in to work until 4 in the afternoon, and he made his entrance at the 7 p.m. Council meeting 15 minutes late. His dark blue blazer made the folds of his naked head look pale. He took his usual spot, leaning on the railing that separates the audience from the Council, and scowled.</p>
        <p>Then, just after it was announced that Mr. Russo had appointed a commissioner, Jean Rodriguez, to the city's public housing authority, chaos erupted. Mr. Ramos said that the mayor had said in April that his administration would consult with tenants of public housing before making any new appointments.</p>
        <p>''I did not say that,'' Mr. Russo said.</p>
        <p>''You said you would meet with the residents,'' Mr. Ramos repeated. ''That's what you said, yes.''</p>
        <p>''No, it is not.''</p>
        <p>''Yes, it is.''</p>
        <p>Several others joined the fray. Mr. Russo accused Mr. Ramos, whose ward contains most of the city's public housing, of being lax in his duties. Mr. Ramos, who took several months off to fight Hodgkin's, took offense. The Council president, Nellie Moyeno, banged her gavel until the room echoed like a construction site.</p>
        <p>Eventually things calmed down. Ms. Rodriguez, beaming, was sworn in and accepted hugs or kisses from all nine Council members, including Mr. Ramos.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, though, Mr. Russo got into a shouting match with the head of the public housing tenants' association, Linda Walker, who was also upset at not being consulted on Ms. Rodriguez's appointment.</p>
        <p>''This is ab-so-lute-ly pos-i-tive-ly wrong!'' Ms. Walker boomed. For the mayor to hold a meeting on the eve of the school board election and make promises to the residents of public housing just to get their votes to put Mr. Russo's wife in office, she said, then to just disregard that promise ----</p>
        <p>''Every promise I ever made in the seven years that I've been mayor has been kept, Linda!'' Mr. Russo yelled, nearly drowning her out even though she had the microphone.</p>
        <p>For good measure, he accused Ms. Walker of being on the payroll of one of his archrivals.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Ms. Walker opined that cancer had indeed changed Mr. Russo.</p>
        <p>''He's gone straight to the devil,'' she said. ''As far as making amends and trying to make sure he doesn't land on a pitchfork when he goes, forget it. He's worse.''</p>
        <p>Up in his office, Mr. Russo basked in the afterglow of his outbursts.</p>
        <p>''It was like a reprieve for me,'' he said. ''There was a little action. It got my mind off things.''</p>
        <p>Today, the test results came in. There was no active cancer anywhere. Even the nodules in his lungs, where doctors believed the cancer started, were benign, though Mr. Russo has been directed to have one-third of his right lung removed just to be safe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russo was ecstatic and grateful.</p>
        <p>The news was greeted in the true Hoboken spirit.</p>
        <p>''Have you seen the tests?'' asked a skeptical member of the opposing camp. ''Some people believe that he's just announcing this to keep his troops from starting to rally against him.</p>
        <p>''And another thing. If these things in his lungs are dormant, why are they being removed?''</p>
