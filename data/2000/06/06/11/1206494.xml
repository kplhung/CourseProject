        <p>LIKE ''cabriolet'' and ''sedan,'' the word ''limousine'' was passed on from carriage makers. Once a carriage with a roof projecting over the chauffeur's seat, it came to mean a long car carrying a V.I.P.</p>
        <p>Many of Europe's finest coachbuilders, like Vanden Plas, Nutting and Le Baron, made the transition to building bodies for luxury motorcars. By the 1930's, companies like Horsch, Maybach, Hispano-Suiza, Bugatti and America's own Duesenburg were creating staggering, chauffeur-driven giants whose aristocratic owners rode in the back in splendid isolation.</p>

        <p>LIKE ''cabriolet'' and ''sedan,'' the word ''limousine'' was passed on from carriage makers. Once a carriage with a roof projecting over the chauffeur's seat, it came to mean a long car carrying a V.I.P.</p>
        <p>Many of Europe's finest coachbuilders, like Vanden Plas, Nutting and Le Baron, made the transition to building bodies for luxury motorcars. By the 1930's, companies like Horsch, Maybach, Hispano-Suiza, Bugatti and America's own Duesenburg were creating staggering, chauffeur-driven giants whose aristocratic owners rode in the back in splendid isolation.</p>
        <p>After World War II, steep luxury taxes prevented a revival of custom coaches. In America, Cadillac and Lincoln eventually consolidated the limousine business around a couple basic models. And that is how Vini Bergeman found things when he arrived on the scene 28 years ago and whipped out his saw.</p>
        <p>''I started the whole thing -- me, I changed the business,'' said Mr. Bergeman, 48, owner of Ultra Limousine of Corona, Calif. ''I built the first stretch limo. I still build the most biggest and most amazing limos on the planet.''</p>
        <p>Few would argue. Among the cars built by Mr. Bergeman, who says he learned about cars by stealing them in the Bronx, where he grew up, is the current Guinness record-holder. That 105-foot-long tyrannosaurus stretch has such amenities as a helicopter pad, putting green, Jacuzzi and wine cellar. He also built a 50-foot, 10-wheel Cadillac that has a swimming pool, two sunroofs, two wet bars, three TV's and two double beds.</p>
        <p>He also played with fire. ''I built one stretch limo with a fireplace,'' he said. ''Then I sold five more just like that.'' He is planning a limo with a bowling alley.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bergeman routinely stretches Rolls-Royces, Bentleys and Jaguars, sawing them in half and fabricating 10-foot sections to splice in the middle. Ultra has also taken the saw to Ferrari Testarossas and Lamborghini Diablos -- a procedure that most car enthusiasts would prefer not to watch.</p>
        <p>Ultra stretched a Mercedes-Benz for Sylvester Stallone to be used as a prop in ''Rocky IV.'' It had hot and cold running water, refrigerator, wet bar and ''Italian Stallion'' emblems in the rugs. He says his other Hollywood clients have included Frank Sinatra, John Travolta, Muhammad Ali, Tommy Lasorda -- ''all the heavyweights.'' Even Yanni: the king of the mystic-music peace vibe ordered a stretch Hummer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bergeman also built The Sheik. At 14,000 pounds and a length of 66.5 feet (a city bus is about 40), it is the largest car-based limousine ever made. Built for $1.8 million for an Arab sheik, the white Lincoln Town Car has a trailer-type hinge in the middle to help it get around corners.</p>
        <p>The Sheik, ordered off the road in California in 1996 because of its extreme length, is now owned by Bob Strauser of Star Limo in Chicago. ''When I saw The Sheik,'' Mr. Strauser says, ''I was mesmerized. I just had to have it.''</p>
        <p>Star Limo claims the world's largest collection of mega-stretches. Its parking lot is crowded with 30-  and 40-foot limos -- all in wedding-cake white -- with nearly every amenity a roving bachelor party might require: TV's, VCR's, bars, video games, rumble seats, hot tubs, fiber-optic disco lights.</p>
        <p>Another of Mr. Bergeman's clients is Mario DaRocha of White Star Limousine in Yonkers. Mr. DaRocha's garage includes a pristine 1942 Packard One-Eighty limo, as well as stretched versions of the Lexus LS 400, BMW 740iL and Ferrari 4000i.</p>
        <p>Among White Star's most popular offerings are stretch Hummers and Lincoln Navigators. ''S.U.V.'s are perfect for conversion to limos,'' Mr. DaRocha said. ''As cars have gotten smaller, S.U.V.'s have gotten bigger. They've got plenty of room.'' It takes eight paces to walk from one end to the other of his 40-foot Navigators.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bergeman's notoriety has spawned a host of imitators who are creating a multitude of unlikely limos -- newlyweds can be whisked from the church in anything from a stretched Chrysler PT Cruiser to a 40-foot Cadillac Escalade with a aquarium.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bergeman also has his antagonists. The limousine industry is, as a whole, trying to dignify its image. ''I'm sure exotics have their place,'' said Mr. Lefkowitz, a lobbyist for National Limousine Association. ''But our association working hard to show that limo operators are professionals.''</p>
        <p>Safety is also an issue. Mr. Lefkowitz said several states were considering length restrictions modeled on a New Jersey law limiting stretches to no more than five passengers beyond the original capacity. Superstretches are classified as omnibus vehicles subject to more rigorous inspections.</p>
