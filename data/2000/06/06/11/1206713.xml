        <p>Why should President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore suddenly take interest in a special election in an obscure state legislative district in Pennsylvania?</p>
        <p>Starting tomorrow, Mr. Clinton will be heard on radio spots and in phone-bank messages urging voters in the Scranton-area district to support the Democratic candidate, Jim Wansacz. Then on Tuesday, Mr. Gore is scheduled to campaign for Mr. Wansacz.</p>

        <p>Why should President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore suddenly take interest in a special election in an obscure state legislative district in Pennsylvania?</p>
        <p>Starting tomorrow, Mr. Clinton will be heard on radio spots and in phone-bank messages urging voters in the Scranton-area district to support the Democratic candidate, Jim Wansacz. Then on Tuesday, Mr. Gore is scheduled to campaign for Mr. Wansacz.</p>
        <p>Not to be politically skunked, the Republican candidate, Tom Parry, has called on the state's popular governor, Tom Ridge, for help. Mr. Ridge will also campaign in the Scranton area on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The reason for all this sudden high-level attention on state House District 114 -- and the attention won't end with the race in the 114th -- is redistricting, a sleeper issue in Election 2000.</p>
        <p>As soon as the 2000 Census is completed, legislatures around the country, including the Pennsylvania Legislature, will begin using the new numbers to redraw state and federal legislative districts. A rough rule holds that the political party that controls both the governor's office and the legislature in a state can redraw district lines so that one of every five districts tilts in its favor.</p>
        <p>Republicans control both the governor's office and the Legislature in Pennsylvania. But their hold on the 203-member Pennsylvania House is wispy thin -- 102 Republicans, 100 Democrats -- and the seat in the 114th is up for grabs on June 20 because the incumbent, a Republican, resigned after being convicted of perjury.</p>
        <p>In recent years, $250,000 would finance a good run for a seat in the Pennsylvania House. This year, Mr. Wansacz and Mr. Parry each expect to spend double that.</p>
