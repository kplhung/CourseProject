        <p>STEPPING inside Ocean Drive in South Norwalk is like being dropped into South Beach in Miami. A sense of here's-where-it's-happening excitement permeates the new restaurant (a sibling of Habana, two blocks away). A gigantic orange and teal hand-blown glass ceiling sculpture by Dale Chihuly adds even more pizazz.</p>
        <p>Ocean Drive would be all splash, no substance, if it weren't for the food. You don't have to love seafood to eat here, but it helps. There are just four non-seafood items on the extensive menu.</p>

        <p>STEPPING inside Ocean Drive in South Norwalk is like being dropped into South Beach in Miami. A sense of here's-where-it's-happening excitement permeates the new restaurant (a sibling of Habana, two blocks away). A gigantic orange and teal hand-blown glass ceiling sculpture by Dale Chihuly adds even more pizazz.</p>
        <p>Ocean Drive would be all splash, no substance, if it weren't for the food. You don't have to love seafood to eat here, but it helps. There are just four non-seafood items on the extensive menu.</p>
        <p>What attracts us are the many fish and shellfish dishes with an extra kick. Seafood straight -- broiled, fried, poached or baked -- can be boring, though Ocean Drive does offer seven popular fish (among them salmon, yellowfin tuna, swordfish, red snapper and Chilean sea bass) available charcoal grilled or pan-roasted.</p>
        <p>The char-grilled Pacific mahi mahi was moist but blah. But who could resist Thai red curry mussels and Manila clams? Not us! Not ever! Spiked with lemongrass, the red-hot curry broth tweaked the mussels and tiny clams mischievously.</p>
        <p>Thai fieryness also buoyed up a spicy bouillabaisse, bathing a welcome mixture of tiny mahogany clams, swordfish, calamari, rock shrimp and udon noodles in a lemongrass-chili broth.</p>
        <p>A fennel-avocado salsa inspired an appetizer of salt-crusted shrimp, but in the chili pepper-steamed dancing shrimp, another starter, the large prawn-size shrimp were virtually asphyxiated by a heavy-handed rubdown of hot pepper.</p>
        <p>We fell for the mahogany sea bass, served with a miso glaze, bok choy and inspired wasabi-mashed potatoes (with real horseradish zing). Sesame-crusted tuna sashimi combined raw tuna slabs with mixed Asian greens in a perky ponzu (soy and rice vinegar) dressing.</p>
        <p>Delicate rice-crusted halibut with mahogany clams made another appealing entree, as did the pan-fried Maine crab cakes, loose textured and full of fresh crabmeat.</p>
        <p>Fried oysters came with a terrific twist. Ever so slightly battered and fried, each oyster perched lightly on a dab of lemon tartar sauce in half an oyster shell, making a pretty and practical dish.</p>
        <p>Fried calamari, with yogurt-based taziki dip, were crisp and tasty, but, curiously, the similarly treated squid in a fried calamari salad were tough, tepid and only partially redeemed by greens and a balsamic soy vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>The kitchen's reach sometimes exceeds its grasp. Roasted salmon chermoula with a ''Moroccan spice rub and kalamata couscous'' sparked our interest, but the sauce overwhelmed the fish and the gummy couscous stuck together.</p>
        <p>We were even less enchanted with the pan-roasted skate wing (too much corn crusting took all the juiciness out of the fish) and the grilled leeks were dried out. We did enjoy the delicious clams casino mashers (mashed potatoes with bacon and onions) that accompanied the fish.</p>
        <p>Pasta jambalaya was a zesty dish but we would have relished more shrimp, Lousiana crawfish and chorizo and less corkscrew pasta. Pasta overwhelmed linguine and clams as well, though we savored the four clam varieties and plethora of roasted garlic cloves.</p>
        <p>Flourless chocolate cake and vanilla creme brulee (with an extraneous chocolate-dipped half banana) were stars among a handful of desserts.</p>
        <p>We spent $70 for dinner for two, before tax, tip or drinks. The small wine list features interesting vintages from France, Australia, Italy and the West Coast, priced from $26. There is also a short, well-selected beer list.</p>
        <p>While the bar action focuses on the under-30 crowd, the restaurant attracts various ages and a friendly staff makes everyone comfortable. New as it is, Ocean Drive reminds us how much fun dining out can be, without costing a fortune.</p>
