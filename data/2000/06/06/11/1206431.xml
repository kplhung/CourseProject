        <p>HAD there not been an enlightened teacher education program at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, Daniel Mendoza Connor might have been lost in the shuffle.</p>
        <p>Daniel, a fourth grader at F. E. Bellows School in Rye Neck, was failing academically.</p>
        <p>Several months ago, though, his teacher, William McKeon, an alumnus of Sarah Lawrence's Art of Teaching graduate program, learned of Daniel's fascination with filmmaking and used that insight to draw the boy out.</p>
        <p>Today, Daniel's movie projects grace the walls of Bellows -- his colorful timeline on the history of movies, reports on cinema-related books and chronicles of the process of animation.</p>
        <p>''He was not a traditional learner in any sense,'' Mr. McKeon said. ''I didn't know what to expect from him. But when I saw his projects, I said, 'Daniel, this is wonderful.' It's about allowing children to investigate and construct their own kind of knowledge, based on passions, based on life experiences.''</p>
        <p>This attention to the individual is one of three elements that distinguish the Art of Teaching from more conventional fare.</p>
        <p>A second element is the priority accorded lifelong learning for teachers -- graduates are encouraged to keep in touch with their instructors. The third element is a resolve to aim higher than teaching to standardized tests.</p>
        <p>Sara Wilford, who founded the Art of Teaching in 1985, elaborated on the last principle.</p>
        <p>''You obviously want to help a child to understand the concepts that are going to appear on the test,'' she said. ''And you want to give them the skills of test taking -- how to fill in the bubbles, listen to directions, and so forth. But if you're teaching a rich curriculum, that should mean you don't have to spend a lot of time teaching specifically to a test.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wilford earned her B.A. from Sarah Lawrence and her advanced degree from the Bank Street College of Education in Manhattan. She is the director of the Art of Teaching program and of the Early Child Center/ Psychology program, also at Sarah Lawrence.</p>
        <p>''Designing a cohesive program was at first daunting, but it became exciting to me,'' she recalled. ''Calling it the 'Art' of Teaching was a very considered choice of the word. That doesn't mean you don't have knowledge.</p>
        <p>''It means, to me at least, that you need to be an intuitive interpreter of knowledge when you're dealing with other people. And there's no more intensive work in terms of human relations than teaching.''</p>
        <p>Graduate students can complete the program full time in two years or part time in three.</p>
        <p>Art of Teaching graduates carry on the program's philosophy around Westchester -- in Rye Neck, Larchmont, Bronxville, Greenburgh, and Mamaroneck.</p>
        <p>Joyce Halpert was a member of Art of Teaching's first graduating classes. She now teaches kindergarten at the Murray Avenue School in Larchmont.</p>
        <p>Her classroom is alive with inducements to the senses, beckonings to the imagination: outspoken parakeets, microscopes, materials to grow marigolds from seed, kingdoms of blocks, books here, there and everywhere and simple circuits (''It's 'circuits,' not circus,'' Ms. Halpert gently corrected one enthusiast.)</p>
        <p>For Ms. Halpert, Sally Kitchen, a little girl bedecked in blond French braids one morning, personifies the awakening that can signify learning.</p>
        <p>''She did all this scribble-scrabble on a paper because she wanted so much to do cursive writing and not print,'' Ms. Halpert said. ''Not long ago, she said to me, 'How do you spell 'book'? I know it's 'bok' but there's something missing.' Well, if you're an observant teacher, you know that this child is now tuning in to text.''</p>
        <p>Teacher and students reach a compact of sorts, Ms. Halpert explained. ''Trust is an important part of the Sarah Lawrence style,'' she said. ''My students know I wouldn't ask this if I didn't think they could do it. They trust me, and I trust that they can learn.''</p>
        <p>She stays in constant contact with her Art of Teaching colleagues, most frequently with Mary Hebron, director of elementary education.</p>
        <p>At the Murray Avenue School in Larchmont, two boys and a girl, members of Sheila Johnson's fourth grade class, were literally up to their elbows in chocolate chip cookie dough.</p>
        <p>Of the three students, Genna Sperling said she wants to become a mathematician or a historian someday. ''When you're cooking, you learn math because you're measuring and stuff. The boys are as good as the girls at cooking. We all learn a lot from it. Men have to cook a couple of times in their lives, you know?''</p>
        <p>One of the boys, Matthew Riemer, said: ''The batch turned out really well. We learned fractions, and we learned a lot about working together better.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson, another Art of Teaching graduate, said the activity has multiple advantages. ''I think it's one way that children make sense of their own lives.''</p>
        <p>As for the question of teaching or not teaching to the tests, Ms. Johnson said: ''I allow children much choice to get them where they need to go. I really believe that if we do this right, the standards are a minimum. Because they can attain so much more than what they're asked to do, we can expect them to be not only proficient, but to excel.''</p>
