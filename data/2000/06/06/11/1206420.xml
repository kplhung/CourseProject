        <p>SAYING that their ''world class'' brand of history and art has long been overlooked, seven Westchester cultural institutions have come up with a joint advertising campaign they hope will lure tourists to the county and spur the kind of corporate donations they need to pay for future promotions.</p>
        <p>Calling its campaign the ''Seven Wonders of Westchester,'' the group has booked more than a month's worth of television spots and newspaper ads urging visitors to see, hear, explore, imagine and enjoy places like Sleepy Hollow, the Neuberger Museum of Art and Kykuit, the former Rockefeller estate.</p>

        <p>SAYING that their ''world class'' brand of history and art has long been overlooked, seven Westchester cultural institutions have come up with a joint advertising campaign they hope will lure tourists to the county and spur the kind of corporate donations they need to pay for future promotions.</p>
        <p>Calling its campaign the ''Seven Wonders of Westchester,'' the group has booked more than a month's worth of television spots and newspaper ads urging visitors to see, hear, explore, imagine and enjoy places like Sleepy Hollow, the Neuberger Museum of Art and Kykuit, the former Rockefeller estate.</p>
        <p>The campaign is being financed by a $100,000 contribution from AT&amp;T and features a 30-second TV commercial, which will be broadcast locally on A&amp;E, CNN, MSG and News 12. Leaders of the institutions said the effort will fill a void by marketing their sites as tourist destinations rather than just artsy amenities that improve the quality of life in Westchester, like good schools or parks.</p>
        <p>''We were very much pitched as the reason to move your company headquarters to Westchester, and a lot of dollars went to that,'' said Burns Patterson, a spokesman for Historic Hudson Valley in Tarrytown, which operates six historic sites. ''Yet, that is leaving out a whole other side of what we do, which has an even stronger direct economic impact, which is bringing tourism in.''</p>
        <p>For years, the Westchester Convention and Visitors Bureau focused solely on attracting conventions, promoting the county's hotels and restaurants without recognizing how the arts could bring in money, Mr. Patterson and his colleagues said. More recently, things turned chaotic as the bureau's former chief executive, Robert Elliott, resigned to pursue a campaign for Congress and 4 of 15 board members abruptly left amid disagreements over the direction the bureau should take.</p>
        <p>The seven cultural institutions -- the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts, the Katonah Museum of Art, Lyndhurst, the Hudson River Museum, the Performing Arts Center and the Neuberger Museum of Art, both at Purchase College, and Historic Hudson Valley -- were left feeling disturbed that the turmoil at the bureau was preventing any active marketing of the arts.</p>
        <p>''There was, on one level, no one to talk to,'' Mr. Patterson said.</p>
        <p>With nearly one million visitors collectively, the seven groups, which go by the name Westchester Arts Network, set aside any feelings of competitiveness to develop a joint advertising campaign.</p>
        <p>Alan Steel, a former bureau board member, said he resigned in April partly because the board would not act on the recommendations in a consultant's report that it do more to promote tourism.</p>
        <p>As one of its other themes, the report called for more involvement by the private sector in managing the bureau. But Mr. Steel said the issue was never debated because board members became sidetracked on another issue: whether the bureau should be more independent from the county Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>Currently, the bureau is a public-private entity that receives a share of the county hotel tax as revenue in its $645,525 budget but is run in partnership with the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>Decisions on reorganizing the bureau are ''still in the works,'' said Harold E. Vogt, the bureau chairman and the president and chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>Larry S. Schwartz, chief adviser to County Executive Andrew J. Spano, said the county wants to market tourism but is still studying the issue. He said Mr. Spano supports the ''Seven Wonders of Westchester'' campaign. The leaders of the campaign are encouraged by Mr. Spano's support and by what happened 10 days ago when Eugene A. Magnetti, a Mamaroneck resident and a marketing manager, was tapped as the new president and chief executive at the bureau.</p>
        <p>Mr. Magnetti said he would like to use the Internet as a vehicle to unify the county and make everyone aware of what Westchester has to offer.</p>
        <p>''I am in the information-gathering stage right now,'' Mr. Magnetti said.</p>
        <p>Asked about the bureau's recent turmoil and about the notion that marketing for the arts was long overlooked, Mr. Magnetti said, ''I can't comment on what went on up until this point.'' He said that he hopes to be a fresh face, ''without the baggage.''</p>
