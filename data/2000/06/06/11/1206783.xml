He was truly a renaissance man. He was a highly acclaimed square dance caller, professional singer and band leader. Hank was also a published poet, artist and sculptor, whose works were displayed for years in well known art galleries. He was an outstanding athlete, excelling at basketball, baseball and tennis and rode a unique ''Side By Side'' bicycle with his wife Charlotte throughout Europe. Most recently, Hank achieved success as a professional magician performing on such prestigious cruise lines as the QEII. Hank is survived by Charlotte, his wife of 58 years, and two sons, Gregory Greene and Dr. Richard Greene.
