        <p>As movies like ''The Sixth Sense,'' ''The Blair Witch Project'' and ''Gladiator'' have proven, the path to blockbusterdom is not as complicated as a quadratic equation: it's simply a matter of being creative, original, employing actual actors instead of pretty-faced movie stars, and not actively insulting the intended audience.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As movies like ''The Sixth Sense,'' ''The Blair Witch Project'' and ''Gladiator'' have proven, the path to blockbusterdom is not as complicated as a quadratic equation: it's simply a matter of being creative, original, employing actual actors instead of pretty-faced movie stars, and not actively insulting the intended audience.</p>
        <p>Of course, turning out an intelligent, uncliched film isn't an easy thing to do. Here's a suggestion: instead of putting all your blockbuster eggs in one basket with yet another poorly written testosterone-fest or inane romantic comedy serving as a vanity project for a star with a $20 million paycheck, take that film's $100 million budget and give the money to 10 unknown writer-directors with fresh stories to tell and the hunger to tell them cheaply. If only one of the resulting films spawns a hot new writer, director or actor, the investment will pay off. And if more than one of those films is a hit, then you're ahead of the game.</p>
