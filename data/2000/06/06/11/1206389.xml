        <p>WITH millions and possibly billions of dollars in financing in the balance, a plan to create a reserve for Long Island Sound is being advanced in Connecticut and New York, which are bound together by the 110-mile-long estuary.</p>
        <p>The reserve would protect shoreline and underwater lands, restore habitats and increase public access to the Sound, which is severely limited for the 25 million people who live or work nearby.

        <p>WITH millions and possibly billions of dollars in financing in the balance, a plan to create a reserve for Long Island Sound is being advanced in Connecticut and New York, which are bound together by the 110-mile-long estuary.</p>
        <p>The reserve would protect shoreline and underwater lands, restore habitats and increase public access to the Sound, which is severely limited for the 25 million people who live or work nearby. Though the Sound lies in the most densely populated region of the country, it has attracted less federal support than other estuaries, like Chesapeake Bay.</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, and others said the designation would improve the chances of federal financing by providing a conduit through which money could flow to the states, municipalities and groups involved in carrying out reserve programs.</p>
        <p>''The Congressional climate seems positive for an increase in conservation funding,'' Senator Lieberman said. ''Creating a reserve system might help the Long Island Sound region receive some of that money.''</p>
        <p>Potential federal funds include a share of $900 million in fees from offshore oil drilling. In addition, a bill passed in the House in May would provide $80 million annually for four years to clean up the Sound; the Senate version would provide $10 million a year for five years.</p>
        <p>The reserve would begin a second phase in efforts begun by the two states and the federal government in 1985 to reverse a decline of water quality in the Sound.</p>
        <p>A 1994 agreement between the states and the federal Environmental Protection Agency cited low levels of dissolved oxygen, a condition known as hypoxia, as the leading threat. It set goals for a reduction in nitrogen, which is generated by sewage-treatment plants and causes the overgrowth of algae that consume oxygen, causing hypoxia and killing marine life.</p>
        <p>The nitrogen-reduction programs, paid for principally by state and local governments, have had some success in limiting the spread of hypoxia. But an assessment by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection last August estimated that an area more than five times the size of Manhattan was still hypoxic, mostly in the western Sound.</p>
        <p>New York City, whose four sewage plants account for nearly 40 percent of the treated sewage discharged into the Sound, is being sued by the state and by a private group, the Soundkeeper, for exceeding agreed nitrogen levels.</p>
        <p>Most of the $200 million earmarked for the Sound under New York State's Clean Air and Clean Water Bond Act, and the more than $200 million budgeted by Connecticut for the Sound, is intended to lower nitrogen levels by upgrading treatment plants.</p>
        <p>To date, federal involvement has been limited to annual allocations to the Long Island Sound Office, which administers the 1994 plan. Mark Tedesco, the director, said the program had received about $18.5 million in federal money since 1985. He estimated that fulfilling the 1994 agreement would cost $2 billion over 15 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tedesco said that while hypoxia had been contained, there was no decisive evidence that it had declined as a result of sewage-plant upgrades, even though they had reduced nitrogen discharges by 25 percent since 1994. ''I'm hesitant to say we have significantly reduced the problem,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he added that there could be a lag before a cut in nitrogen resulted in higher levels of dissolved oxygen.</p>
        <p>Proponents of the reserve said it would move beyond upgrades of treatment plants to address acquisition of shoreline properties, measures to restore wetlands and related programs.</p>
        <p>To involve greater numbers of people, increasing access would also be a high priority.</p>
        <p>''We're spending billions of dollars cleaning up the Sound, and most of the people living around it can't get there,'' said Robert D. Yaro, the executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a private planning group. ''It's probably the least accessible piece of coastline in the United States.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yaro said shoreline acquisitions could also limit development, a kind of ''insurance policy for water quality.''</p>
        <p>Save the Sound, which represents environmental and civic groups in the Long Island Sound Watershed Alliance, has identified 450 sites, private and public, that could be preserved or restored. William P. Shadel, a habitat ecologist for the group, said the group's goal was to preserve 2,000 acres of shoreline and strengthen protection along 1,000 miles of riverfront in Connecticut by 2007.</p>
        <p>John Atkin, president of Save the Sound, agreed that land acquisition would ''potentially have a very high price tag,'' but he and others said the cost of degradation from overdevelopment would be more costly.</p>
        <p>The Long Island Sound Office has estimated the annual contribution that the Sound makes to the regional economy at more than $5 billion, with boating and recreation in the lead, despite limits on access.</p>
        <p>David Sutherland, director of government relations for the Connecticut chapter of the Nature Conservancy, said development pressures would make land acquisitions challenging. But though ''the prices may seem high,'' he added, ''in the end it will be a bargain.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Atkin, of Save the Sound, said a reserve could also set aside surface and underwater areas for research into restoring marine habitats and understanding how contaminants affect marine life.</p>
        <p>Proponents of the reserve cited the extensive lobster die-off last fall as a dramatic example of the need to learn more. Researchers said the lobsters might have been attacked by a parasite, but uncertainty remained.</p>
        <p>Some lobster and fishing groups fear that pesticides used in mosquito spraying were washed into the Sound and killed the lobsters.</p>
        <p>William N. Smith, the executive director of Fish Unlimited of Shelter Island, said dumping in the Sound of material dredged from Mamaroneck Harbor could also have played a part. Mr. Smith said the dredged material contained pesticide residues and other contaminants.</p>
        <p>There are four dumping sites in the Sound. The E.P.A. and the Army Corps of Engineers are conducting an environmental study to assess the suitability of the sites.</p>
        <p>David J. Miller, the executive director of the National Audubon Society of New York, said hearings in 1990 helped define issues addressed in the 1994 management plan. ''We want to turn the corner and get the people behind this new initiative,'' he said. ''Now let's look at the natural coast and how to connect people to that natural coast.''</p>
