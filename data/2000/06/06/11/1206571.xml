        <p>IF you called Central Casting looking for some dot-com-founder types, they wouldn't send you these people: the head of a quasi-governmental agency, a college professor who founded a nonprofit group, an industrial quality maven -- all past 40 and  well established on traditional career paths.</p>
        <p>Yet each of them has taken a sharp turn into territory that the popular imagination reserves for 20-something nerds in sneakers and pizza-stained shirts.</p>
        <p>Or maybe it's not so sharp a turn. What Sergio Mazza, Mary Furlong and James Harrington have in common are a knack for synthesis and an open mind about packaging their knowledge and experience in new ways -- characteristics that may matter more as prerequisites for new-economy success than technical wizardry or tolerance of 100-hour workweeks. Each started a Web-based business that extends and amplifies what he or she had been doing before.</p>
        <p>They also have in common an entrepreneurial itch, of course, and they share hopes of big profits online. But world-conquering riches do not seem to be the main point.</p>
        <p>''I'm more of an entrepreneur at heart,'' said Mr. Mazza, 41. ''I like to make things happen.'' His previous incarnation was as chief executive of one of the most nuts-and-bolts organizations in the old economy, the American National Standards Institute, which represents the United States in world forums that set technical standards for a wide array of products and processes.</p>
        <p>Impatient with the glacial pace of the regulatory arena, he left the institute last winter to invest in and advise two Internet start-ups: Revbox.com, which offers consumers service contracts on big-ticket Internet purchases and helps keep track of warranties and arrange service, and WorldWideTesting.com, an industrial marketplace that matches business customers with testing and certification laboratories. Both ideas grew out of his time at the institute, which highlighted the importance of assuring product quality in a global marketplace.</p>
        <p>''I've returned to the for-profit world because I wanted growth and opportunity,'' said Mr. Mazza, who was president of the computer supplies division at Memorex before joining the institute.</p>
        <p>He said he did not choose Internet commerce for its own sake. ''I'm interested in changing the way commerce takes place, particularly changing the speed, breadth and accuracy of information that is delivered,'' he said, adding that the Web is just ''a convenient tool.''</p>
        <p>RAISING start-up capital was a struggle for Mr. Mazza, but he also found he had to wrestle with a bit of a generation gap. Being ''born old,'' as he described himself, sometimes made it difficult for him to work with fresh-faced youngsters in the dot-com world ''who don't have a clue about running a business.'' The challenge, he said, is to help the two start-ups make the most of his experience while ''working on not being condescending.''</p>
        <p>For his own part, he often reminds himself, however swept up he may be in entrepreneurial fervor, to pass up ''good business ideas that involve bad people.''</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Mazza said, he is content with his current partners and keeps his focus on nurturing the two fledgling companies ''until I'm certain they're successful.''</p>
        <p>''Maybe at 51 I won't like it so much,'' he said, ''but I'm happy where I am right now.''</p>
        <p>MRS. FURLONG, the professor, gravitated to the Web as a kind of global classroom -- ''a place to be empowered, and to learn and create as we get older.''</p>
        <p>Throughout her career she has made a habit of spinning off her three decades of academic experience into new ventures. In the mid-1980's she took a leave as an education professor at the University of San Francisco, where she taught teachers how to cope with new technology, and started a nonprofit organization called SeniorNet to do the same thing for elderly people.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, watching the evolution of the Internet and ''realizing the boomer generation would be quite different'' from the seniors she had been working with, she founded ThirdAge Media, whose Web site, www.thirdage.com, aspires to be an online community and shopping site for first-wave baby boomers like her.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Furlong, 51, says her teaching experience is central to her business. ''I've learned to take in the hearts, minds and souls of my customers and make a plan for them to grow, just as I did for my students,'' she explained. Still, she said, she had to swallow hard and summon her tenacity and courage to make the leap from the security of academia to the risks of a new company. ''I had to let my hair down,'' she said. ''I had to learn new skills and make changes. Most of all, I couldn't fail.</p>
        <p>''My father was an entrepreneur, so I've always been interested in taking an idea and bringing it to an international level,'' she said. ''I want the business to be successful, to get a return for our team and shareholders, but I also want to make a difference in the world.''</p>
        <p>NOW in his mid-60's, Mr. Harrington is further still from the prototypical dot-com demographic, and he occasionally feels the tug to go fishing with his many retired friends. But he finds that tackling new challenges and learning new skills keeps him young. ''There's always something interesting that I want to do that I haven't done yet,'' he said. ''There's a continuous need to accomplish.''</p>
        <p>He spent most of a long career in quality management at I.B.M., where he worked for 30 years. He had the makings of a Big Blue lifer: as a boy of 12, his first job was setting pins at the company bowling alley.</p>
        <p>But two years as the volunteer chairman and president of a professional group, the American Society for Quality, showed him wider possibilities. He left I.B.M. and remade himself as a consultant on quality management and business processes. As a consulting principal at Ernst &amp; Young, he developed software related to his work, and software took him to the Web.</p>
        <p>''Technology is changing so fast, it's opening a whole new world of business,'' Mr. Harrington said. ''The excitement of being tapped into this new world is invigorating.'' Today he is tapped into three technology companies: he is chief operating officer of Systemcorp, which makes business process software; chairman of TQnet, an online quality-services provider; and chairman of Performance Improvement Network, a global group of consultants and information-technology service providers. The only link among the three companies is Mr. Harrington and his drive and energy.</p>
        <p>This latest career turn required ''some reassessment of my priorities and beliefs,'' he said, ''For years I found myself in the teacher's role, but in dot-coms there are no teachers; we are all learners.''</p>
        <p>He is not complaining. ''Putting it on the line, win or lose -- that brings me to life,'' Mr. Harrington said. ''I see guys struggling around Pebble Beach -- they get older every day. I get younger.''</p>
