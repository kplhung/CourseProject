        <p>Anyone who wants to find out what a sitooterie is should head for Belsay Hall in northeast England this summer. Scattered around the 30-acre landscaped garden of this grand house built in Greek revival style by Sir Charles Monck in 1817 are 12 sitooteries, the Scottish colloquialism for a structure to sit ''oot'' in. Twelve leading architects, including Sir Norman Foster, Claudio Silverstrin and Julian Opie, have designed contemporary interpretations of the traditional summer house and pavilion, which will be exhibited through Sept. 30 at Belsay Hall in Northumberland.</p>
        <p>Nick Crosbie, of Inflate, has reinvented the bandstand, with a movable molded plastic canopy, and his entry, positioned near the front hall, is the first image visitors will see. FAT (Fashion, Architecture, Taste) has designed a miniature Romanesque church along the woodland walk; Julian Opie's sitooterie is open to interpretation: it could be a garage, a customs barrier or a Greek temple. Perched on an arched ha-ha, Thomas Heatherwick Studio's sitooterie has more than 5,000 protruding ash batons.</p>

        <p>The sitooteries are part of English Heritage's Year of Public Sculpture, a countrywide program of exhibitions, festivals and workshops devoted to sculpture. A free leaflet is available from English Heritage, (44-207) 973-3434, as is ''A User's Guide to Public Sculpture,'' a guide to the public monuments and sculptures, which highlights nine sculpture walks in regional cities ($12 plus postage).</p>
        <p>The sitooteries exhibition is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is $5.70, children $2.85. Belsay Hall is 10 miles from Morpeth station in Northumberland, 285 miles from London; telephone (44-1661) 881636.</p>
