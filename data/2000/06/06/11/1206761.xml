        <p>HOW is the Internet affecting television?

This time around, the station has added a dozen productions that its television audience may never see. They will be shown only on the station's Web site (www.thirteen.org/reelnewyork).</p>
        <p>While viewers can tune in ''Reel New York,'' the television series, at 10 p.m. on Fridays (with repeated episodes at midnight on Sundays), the point-and-click crowd can look in on ''Reel New York Web,'' a round-the-clock interactive showcase.

        <p>HOW is the Internet affecting television? Consider this: WNET has decided that it is no longer enough to broadcast an eight-week series of short films and documentaries, as it has done every spring since 1995. This time around, the station has added a dozen productions that its television audience may never see. They will be shown only on the station's Web site (www.thirteen.org/reelnewyork).</p>
        <p>While viewers can tune in ''Reel New York,'' the television series, at 10 p.m. on Fridays (with repeated episodes at midnight on Sundays), the point-and-click crowd can look in on ''Reel New York Web,'' a round-the-clock interactive showcase. Appropriately enough, one Internet offering -- it is hard to use the word ''film'' in this context -- is ''Empire 24/7,'' which pays homage to Andy Warhol's conceptual artwork by aiming a live Webcam at the Empire State Building.</p>
        <p>''The Web stuff has gone in a direction I myself would not have imagined,'' said Garrison Botts, the producer of ''Reel New York.'' ''It's technically just so different from what I'm accustomed to in film and video. It's not just moving images and audio; It's actually interactive.''</p>
        <p>The television series began last Friday with two works made the old-fashioned way, on 35-millimeter film (both are being shown again tonight). The first is ''Tree Shade,'' which won the gold medal for best alternative film at the Student Academy Awards last year. The other is ''Time Expired,'' the grand prize winner in the 1992 Aspen Shorts Film Festival. It features performances by John Leguizamo before he graduated to feature films like Spike Lee's ''Summer of Sam'' and Edie Falco before she graduated to ''The Sopranos.'' This Friday's episode, ''Culture Crossings,'' pairs two 1998 shorts: Camille Billops's ''Take Your Bags,'' about the stolen memories of African slaves, and Stefan Randstrom's ''Finn in Harlem.''</p>
        <p>''These filmmakers wouldn't have their work shown for the most part unless they were in some kind of a film festival venue,'' Mr. Botts said. ''One airing of the show on Channel 13 and they're reaching more people than they could imagine in a film festival situation.'' How many more? The average number of viewers each week is 75,000, he said.</p>
        <p>Over the years, ''Reel New York'' has given some filmmakers' careers a boost. Miramax called in 1998, asking how to find Abraham Lim after his short film ''Fly'' was shown. Mr. Lim has since edited Robert Altman's ''Cookie's Fortune'' and is working on a feature film, ''Roads and Bridges.'' Another alumnus of ''Reel New York'' is Malcolm Lee, whose ''Morningside Prep'' was shown in 1997. He went on to write and direct the 1999 feature film ''The Best Man.''</p>
        <p>''Reel New York'' began as a showcase for recent works by New York-based artists, but this year Mr. Botts has scheduled several that were not made yesterday -- or even last year. On July 14, ''Reel New York'' will feature the 1959 Beat classic ''Pull My Daisy,'' written and narrated by Jack Kerouac, directed by Alfred Leslie and starring Allen Ginsberg, and ''The Existentialist,'' a 1966 film produced and directed by Leon Prochnik. They will join three recent films -- including ''All Day Ice Cream,'' a 1999 short by Joe Maller -- in the sixth episode of the series: ''The Beat Goes On.'' Mr. Botts said he had not realized it at first, but all three films are related: Mr. Prochnik was the editor on ''Pull My Daisy,'' and Mr. Maller has been working with Mr. Leslie.</p>
        <p>''Immigration Celebration,'' on June 30, includes another not-so-new film: Meredith Monk's ''Ellis Island'' (1982). Ms. Monk, a composer and performer as well as a sometime filmmaker, has memories of making the film -- long memories: the eeriness of the place before ''it was all gussied up and turned into a museum,'' the close-ups she shot of calendars that the Coast Guard had left behind when it vacated offices on Ellis Island in the 1950's, the difficulty of using color and black-and-white shots in the same film. But when Mr. Botts invited her to introduce ''Ellis Island'' on the fourth episode of ''Reel New York,'' she had to compress the memories.</p>
        <p>''I think they wanted 28 seconds,'' she said. ''The first was 32. On take No. 94, I somehow got it down to the length they wanted.''</p>
