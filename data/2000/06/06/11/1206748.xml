        <p>In an unusually widespread eruption of street violence, 28 people were shot or stabbed in 20 apparently unrelated attacks between Friday night and last night, the police said. The victims included six people shot on a street corner in Brooklyn, three people who were killed and a 12-year-old boy who was shot in the face on a basketball court in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The shootings and stabbings, which left at least four people critically wounded, come at a time when most major crimes are at a record low and continuing to decline, according to police statistics.</p>
        <p>But police officials have been vexed by an increase in the murder rate and in the number of shootings, despite a police crackdown on street violence that focuses on drug crimes.</p>
        <p>Police officials declined to comment on the 25 hours of violence, but one official said the fact that there were three killings underscores the gains made since 1990, when the murder rate peaked at 2,245 slayings -- an average of six a day.</p>
        <p>One of the latest incidents took place about 6:40 p.m. yesterday, when six people were wounded in a shooting in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, the police said.</p>
        <p>A gunman standing outside a row house at 598 Marcy Avenue, near Vernon Avenue, opened fire at a group of people outside the building, the police said, adding that the gunman was a drug dealer retaliating at several people in the crowd who had tried to swindle him. The gunman fled toward a Honda that was waiting on Vernon Avenue, officials said.</p>
        <p>''It was like a storm,'' said an attendant at a nearby gas station who witnessed the shooting. ''Bullets came one after the other.''</p>
        <p>Three police officers sitting in an unmarked police car also saw the shooting and drove after the gunman, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman. When the man, armed with a Tech-9 machine pistol, turned toward the police to get into the Honda, the officers opened fire through their own windshield, the police said, but did not hit him.</p>
        <p>The gunman leaped out of the Honda when it got stuck on a one-way street, Detective Pentangelo said. The police arrested the driver and recovered the gun. The gunman is still at large.</p>
        <p>Of the six people injured in that shooting, five were in stable condition last night and one was in serious condition, the authorities said. They were taken to hospitals in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn. One man who ran to escape the shooting broke both his legs, the police said.</p>
        <p>In another shooting last night, Thomas Tabrera, 18, was killed around 6 p.m. on Tinton Avenue, near East 163rd Street, in the Bronx, the police said. Mr. Tabrera, shot four times, was found lying face down in the street, the police said. The gunman was still at large last night.</p>
        <p>The string of violence began about 9 p.m. on a hot and humid Friday with the shooting of the 12-year-old boy and a 22-year-old man in the Melrose Houses at East 155th Street and Courtlandt Avenue in the South Bronx, the police said. The incidents continued steadily in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens until 10 last night, with 19 people wounded in 11 shootings and nine people stabbed in nine attacks, the police said.</p>
        <p>The motivations behind most of the violence were unclear, although the police said that a slashing on a northbound A train at the Nostrand Avenue subway station in Brooklyn stemmed from a robbery and that one of the killings took place during an argument over money.</p>
        <p>In that case, the police said, Waskar Tejeda, 27, stabbed Juan Reyes, 23, in the stomach about 2:30 a.m. yesterday inside 1975 Bathgate Avenue in the Tremont section of the Bronx. Mr. Tejeda, of the Bronx, was charged with second-degree murder.</p>
        <p>Another shooting in Bedford-Stuyvesant left Darryl Baum, 34, fatally wounded. A gunman walked up to Mr. Baum at the corner of Quincy Street and Marcy Avenue about 1:40 a.m. yesterday and fired a single shot into his head, the police said.</p>
        <p>In the basketball court shooting, the 12-year-old victim was Edwin Sanderson, according to a boy who was playing basketball with him. The youth was shot in the chin, the police said. The older victim, identified by the police as Peter Brooks, 22, was shot in the back. They were listed in critical condition yesterday at Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>About 2:40 a.m. yesterday, a masked gunman walked up to a man and two women in front of 434 East 22nd Street in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn and began firing a pistol, the police said, hitting the man, who is 25, several times in the head and chest. One woman, 23, was shot in the leg and the second woman, a 21-year-old, was hit in the stomach, the police said. They were taken to Kings County Hospital, where the man was in critical condition and the two women were in stable condition, the authorities said.</p>
