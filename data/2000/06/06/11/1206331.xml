        <p>IN his 3,000-page monument to lost time, Marcel Proust barely mentions the cinema. Writing in the decades immediately following film's invention, he appears to have been largely uninterested by the medium in which so many memories of the 20th century would be stored.</p>
        <p>''I think he saw very few films,'' said Jean-Yves Tadie, a professor at the Sorbonne, over tea recently at his home here in a graceful fin-de-siecle apartment building. The English translation of Mr. Tadie's biography, ''Marcel Proust: A Life,'' will be released by Viking in August. ''Perhaps a few newsreels, or some light Gaumont comedies. He went out very little toward the end of his life, fearing attacks of asthma. He died before Abel Gance's 'Napoleon,' and probably never knew the films of Chaplin. And so he must not have understood that film was an art.''</p>

        <p>IN his 3,000-page monument to lost time, Marcel Proust barely mentions the cinema. Writing in the decades immediately following film's invention, he appears to have been largely uninterested by the medium in which so many memories of the 20th century would be stored.</p>
        <p>''I think he saw very few films,'' said Jean-Yves Tadie, a professor at the Sorbonne, over tea recently at his home here in a graceful fin-de-siecle apartment building. The English translation of Mr. Tadie's biography, ''Marcel Proust: A Life,'' will be released by Viking in August. ''Perhaps a few newsreels, or some light Gaumont comedies. He went out very little toward the end of his life, fearing attacks of asthma. He died before Abel Gance's 'Napoleon,' and probably never knew the films of Chaplin. And so he must not have understood that film was an art.''</p>
        <p>Still, in ''Remembrance of Things Past,'' the narrator's memories of childhood in the village of Combray -- with its black-steepled church and all its inhabitants -- which unfold like a Chinese paper flower from the fragrant cup of tea in which he's dunked a madeleine,  seem an apt metaphor for film's remarkable power to revive the past and make the dead live again.</p>
        <p>''Film is a very Proustian medium,'' said Raul Ruiz, the director of ''Time Regained,'' during an interview after the film's premiere at the Cannes International Film Festival last year. This remarkable adaptation of the final volume of ''Remembrance of Things Past'' opens in New York on Friday. ''At any given moment, you can be kidnapped by the past.''</p>
        <p>But ''Remembrance of Things Past'' does not lend itself easily to film adaptation. Filmmakers must cope with the novel's extraordinary length, and its strangely porous nature.</p>
        <p>''In most novels, you have action, dialogue and commentary,'' Mr. Tadie said. ''But in Proust, the commentary takes up so much space. A few lines of dialogue are followed by five pages of the narrator's observations. And if you reduce things to action, there just isn't much of it. He's no Sir Walter Scott.''</p>
        <p>Then there is the question of finding a cinematic equivalent for those interminable sentences, which seem to explore every shading of erotic ambivalence or gilt Sevres porcelain, and in which one can almost hear the asthmatic author gasping for breath.</p>
        <p>And finally, there is the problem common to all literary adaptations, but extreme in Proust's case, of reconciling cinematic time with the experience of reading. Film's gratifications are relatively speedy and immediate, while Proust's novel preaches the infinite pleasures of deferral. Months or even years may separate the reading of the first volume from the seventh and last. How can all those intimate, solitary hours of enchantment be translated into a marketable 120 minutes on screen ?</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruiz explained his working method. ''For a long while, Einstein thought that, if time were a dimension, it should be visible,'' he said. ''In making this film, I wondered how I might play with that idea. I approached it in the most naive manner possible.'' Using flashbacks, repetitions and visual refrains, he created a film as intricately structured as a symphony, where each part refers back to another in an infinite play of mirrors. He cast a mother and daughter (Catherine Deneuve and Chiara Mastroianni) as Odette and Albertine, figures who are unrelated in the novel but whose roles as loved women echo each other across generations. Within the continuous flow of his film's two-and-one-half hours, time seems to expand exponentially.</p>
        <p>EARLY on in Proust's novel, the narrator describes the long afternoons he spent in his room at Combray, amusing himself with a magic lantern, a pre-cinematic device something like a slide projector, whose glass negatives could be changed to create the illusion of motion. The luminous images swallowed whole the forms of the doorknobs and curtains onto which they were projected, and took on extraordinary life for him. So every director who has adapted Proust's work for film finds his own vision of cinema reflected in that impossible project.</p>
        <p>Late in life, Luchino Visconti, the poet of smoldering, suppressed passion among Italian aristocracy, planned a screen version of Proust's middle volume, ''Sodom and Gommorah,'' but the work was never realized. Near the end of his career, Joseph Losey commissioned a screenplay called ''Proust Scenario,'' based on the novel and written by the playwright Harold Pinter, but no film emerged from it.</p>
        <p>Percy Adlon's ''Celeste'' (1981) was inspired by the memoirs of Celeste Albaret, who worked as Proust's maid during the last eight years of the author's life. Proust, a notoriously big tipper in restaurants, was also known for his extravagant kindness toward servants. Mr. Adlon's film, a strange combination of reticence and caricature, follows a woman living in the antechamber of greatness, rising at 3 p.m. each day to bring Monsieur his ''morning'' coffee, and remaining on call for most of the night -- a portrait of the intimate bond between the invalid artist and his servant.</p>
        <p>Still, one had to wait until 1984 before a filmmaker tackled the novel directly. For ''Swann in Love,'' Volker Schlondorff cast Jeremy Irons as the cultivated Jewish art collector Charles Swann and a remarkably fluffy Ornella Muti as Odette, the courtesan he eventually marries. There's lots of lingerie, with heavy emphasis on a pulchritudinous orchid tucked into Odette's swelling breast. But by eliminating the crucial position of narrator, Mr. Schlondorff sacrificed the novel's philosophical dimension, which transforms Proust's account of aristocratic decadence and erotic despair into a highly evolved work of art.</p>
        <p>Last month, Chantal Akerman's ''Captive'' had its premiere in the Director's Fortnight at Cannes. Ms. Akerman's Proust draws upon passages from ''La Prisonniere,'' the novel's darkly minimalist fifth volume, which describe the relation between the narrator and his lover, Albertine -- a complex and ever-changing equation whose key elements are jealousy, domination, sequestration and flight. To render this bond, Ms. Akerman returned to the claustrophobic style of ''Jeanne Dielmann, 23 Quai de Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles,'' the monumental film she made in 1975 when she was just 24 years old, about three days in the life of a Belgian housewife, mother and prostitute.</p>
        <p>''For 'La Captive,' I worked a lot in interior spaces,'' Ms. Akerman said in a cafe on the Place des Vosges. ''The town houses, the cars. Through them, the viewer is projected into a mental universe. At the same time, you escape all psychological explanation. You're just caught in a machine that moves forward.'' Ms. Akerman's signature style is the long traveling shot. In ''La Captive,'' it tracks the movements through Paris of a young woman in a floral print dress, and evokes the narrator's libidinal fixations.</p>
        <p>Proust's iconic stature in French culture may explain why to date there have been no French film interpretations. Mr. Adlon and Mr. Schlondorff are German; Ms. Akerman is Belgian, though she has lived in France for decades.</p>
        <p>OVER the course of some 60 films, Mr. Ruiz (a Chilean who moved to Paris in the 1970's) has cultivated a surrealist sensibility far removed from the conventions of period drama and the salons of the Belle Epoque. But ''Time Regained'' is a summation of themes that have preoccupied him throughout his career, from the theoretical rigors of ''Hypothesis of a Stolen Painting'' (1978) to more recent thrillers like ''Genealogies of a Crime'' (1996): a fascination with doubles and the uncanny, memory and childhood, the visual arts and philosophy.</p>
        <p>His Proust is imbued with a narrative self-consciousness that owes much to the author Jorge Luis Borges. But Mr. Ruiz also is able to train an almost ethnographic eye on Parisian habits and manners. Among his reference points for ''Time Regained'' were Edward Curtis's sepia-toned, early-20th-century portraits of Native Americans, in which grandeur combines with the threat of extinction.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to explore what it's like to be a member of a tribe,'' he explained. ''These French aristocrats, with their boredom and their rituals. I tried to describe the behavior of that tiny part of society.''</p>
        <p>''Time Regained'' opens in 1922 as Proust (played by Marcello Mazzarella, an Italian actor who bears a striking resemblance to the writer) lies on his deathbed, attended by the faithful Celeste. He regards a series of photographs of figures in his life through a magnifying glass.</p>
        <p>Subtly, the furniture in his room starts moving, and we are carried back in time to Parisian soirees during World War I, where, far from the front lines where men were dying, the upper classes drank Champagne and listened to Beethoven. The infidelities of Robert de Saint-Loup (Pascal Greggory), who betrays his wife Gilberte (Emmanuelle Beart) with both the actress Rachel (Elsa Zylberstein) and the arriviste violinist Morel (Vincent Perez); the ghosts of the narrator's childhood love for Gilberte and his adult passion for Albertine; the social ambitions and artistic pretensions of Mme. Verdurin (Marie-France Pisier); the lingering vanity of Odette; the strange sexual proclivities of the Baron de Charlus (John Malkovich); and the stench of death which hangs equally over soldiers on leave from the trenches and le tout Paris arrayed for an elegant matinee concert; all these memories swarm around the narrator. The effect is like a piece of music, a gradual building of a sense of loss and time's passing, combined with a fanatical devotion to detail and a gently ironic regard for human frailty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruiz reflected upon the author's perennial fascination. ''There are Proustians who have nothing to do with the world of Proust,'' Mr. Ruiz said. ''Myself, for example. But also, Taiwanese dentists, African economists, rock stars, and others. One of the characters in Jack Kerouac's 'On the Road,' either Sal Paradise or Dean Moriarty, is continually reading Proust while he's working in a parking lot. You can apply a Proustian vision to almost any context. My explanation is that Proust teaches you a way to look at your own life, and that the life of any human being is incredibly rich.''</p>
