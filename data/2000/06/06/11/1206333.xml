        <p>PERHAPS the trend began years ago with Mutual of Omaha's ''Wild Kingdom,'' which each week gave viewers a fly-in-the-Sahara view of such animal behavior as lions ripping gazelles to shreds.</p>
        <p>The show, and others that came after it, had a very specific appeal. There was the promise of something violent and slightly gory to provide an evening's worth of entertainment. Even better, the carnage was happening to an animal living in some faraway land, so viewers at home didn't have to worry about getting personally involved.</p>
        <p>As with most other vicarious thrill-seeking, however, things have escalated. It's no longer exciting just to see gory video of jungle animals in peril. We've moved on to humans, with the arrival of a spate of medical reality series that take people so far inside the lives of others that you can see their gall bladders. Welcome to the world of Must-Bleed TV.</p>
        <p>Recent months have brought viewers Katie Couric's colonoscopy on the ''Today'' show and Carnie Wilson's liposuction live on the Internet. On the Discovery Health Channel's ''Operation'' or the Health Network's ''O.R.: Behind the Mask,'' you get an up-too-close-and-personal view of everything from breast augmentation to rotator-cuff surgery. On the Learning Channel's ''Maternity Ward'' and ''A Baby Story,'' the miracle of birth is broadcast on a weekly basis. TLC also features the weekly show ''Trauma: Life in the E.R.,'' which follows real emergency room doctors as they repair everyone from a child with a split lip to a man with a bullet in his brain.</p>
        <p>This is not television to eat dinner by. While the programs offer varying degrees of gore, the most benign procedures can still trouble even the slightly squeamish. It's hard to imagine any woman wanting breast implants after watching a doctor use a metal poker to jab a jiggling plastic bag into the gaping wound on a patient's chest. Instead of shying away from a brain-revealing gash in the back of a construction worker's head (''Trauma'') or an exposed, pumping heart during surgery (''The Operation''), the camera zeroes in the same way it might follow a foul ball into the crowd during a baseball game.</p>
        <p>These shows appeal to audiences in two very different ways. On one hand, they cater to the sort of people who couldn't wait to dissect that frog back in high school science class. They legitimize watching something gross by putting it all in a medical context. At the same time, though, they also satisfy the audience's craving for heroes. Physicians apparently appreciate these series because they make the medical profession look good.</p>
        <p>Picture an episode of ''E.R.'' or ''Marcus Welby, M.D.,'' but eliminate all the romantic subplots and add shots of a woman's stomach being pulled by hand from her chest, where it has lodged after a severe car accident, and you get the idea. Some shows, like ''Behind the Mask'' and ''Operation,'' can be dry and clinical as doctors ramble on about the medical specifics of what they are doing. Others, like ''Trauma'' or ''Paramedics'' on TLC, feature a nonstop parade of tragedies while also taking time out to get to know some of the medical personnel.</p>
        <p>In either case, these new medical reality shows offer graphic glimpses of humans at their most vulnerable moments. And audiences apparently can't get enough. ''Trauma'' now averages about 5 million viewers a week, and the programming block that includes it and ''Paramedics'' has doubled its viewers since last year. The Health Network, which reaches 17.5 million homes, is in negotiations with major cable systems nationwide and officials expect it to be more widely available.</p>
        <p>''The best way to explain the appeal of these shows is to picture yourself driving down the street, and then you see a car accident that's just happened,'' says Jay Bailey, a Worcester, Mass., radio disc jockey who started a fan club after mentioning ''Trauma'' on his show and being deluged by calls from other devotees. ''Nobody wants to admit it, but we all slow down to take a look. We never say, 'I hope that person is O.K.' We ask ourselves, 'What am I going to see?' I realize that's not a pleasant thing, but we do it.''</p>
        <p>This response isn't a surprise to those who broadcast the shows. After all, says Marc Krigsman, senior vice president for programming, production and content at the Health Network, ''There is an element of voyeurism to this programming, but it extends throughout all of television. Television, by its very nature, is all about looking into other people's lives.''</p>
        <p>There is an initial ''there but for the grace of God go I'' appeal to watching from the relative safety of your living room as total strangers endure a cornea transplant or have a knife wound stitched up. But this is only temporary, say both Mr. Krigsman and Jana Bennett, executive vice president and general manager of TLC: it is almost always followed by something deeper.</p>
        <p>''I think the primary feeling viewers experience is empathy,'' Ms. Bennett says. ''People may be curious about blood and guts, but that isn't what keeps them watching. They realize what is happening to the people on the shows could happen to them as well. The programs get to the most essential notion of being human.''</p>
        <p>It serves as a reminder to enjoy your good health now because you never know what can happen tomorrow. Meanwhile, the patients being opened up in front of millions of strangers seem pretty comfortable providing this service.</p>
        <p>Regina Lynch, a 31-year-old San Diego woman, was featured on ''Trauma'' when she was hospitalized after a near-fatal car accident. ''What happened to me is reality,'' she says now. ''That's life. What happened to me could have happened to anyone else. A lot of people realize that and will tell me they found courage in my story. If there is any ray of sunshine in this massive black cloud hanging over me, I'm glad to help.''</p>
        <p>Patti Derman allowed her double-mastectomy last year to be first broadcast over the Internet and then rerun as an award-winning special on the Health Network. Although Ms. Derman, a 47-year-old emergency room nurse, was initially supposed to remain anonymous, she opted to go public with her surgery because, she said, ''I've always wanted to do something significant with my life.''</p>
        <p>Becoming a minor celebrity in her suburban Philadelphia community, and putting up with cameras filming her every visit to the doctor along with her entire surgery, seemed to her a small price to pay for such a public service.</p>
        <p>''Since the surgery, I have received cards and letters from women I don't know thanking me for what I did,'' Ms. Derman says. ''They are women who had the surgery and had a tough time coping. Just yesterday in the E.R. where I work, a woman came in and I just knew she was a chemo patient. I talked to her about her surgery and she said to me: 'I can't believe I met you. You're a celebrity! I can't wait to tell my support group about this.' I know that on this small level, maybe I did help people and make a difference.''</p>
        <p>That difference is information. Medical reality shows are dense with terminology and explanations about surgical procedures. More knowledge, says Ms. Derman's doctor, Beth DuPree, means less fear if a patient is eventually confronted with the reality of breast cancer or any other health problem.</p>
        <p>''Since we did Patti's surgery, I've seen patients who did self-examinations they might not otherwise have done if they hadn't seen her broadcast,'' Dr. DuPree says. ''These sort of programs inspire patients to ask questions of their doctors, and that's great, because the one thing that scares me is when patients don't have knowledge enough to do that.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard Corlin, a senior official of the American Medical Association, adds: ''In general, I think these shows are quite helpful. They're educational and informative. They let the public know what's happening in the world of medicine. I think I'd rather have somebody see one of these shows with a little blood or gore from surgery than something where 17 people get killed.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, medical reality shows are the best publicity doctors could get. Particularly in these days of malpractice suits and H.M.O. horror stories, physicians don't have the best reputations. No matter how caring George Clooney might have seemed on ''E.R.,'' viewers know that characters in fictional series are exaggerated visions of what we'd like our doctors to be.</p>
        <p>But with a reality series, what you see is what you get. Dr. Tim Buchman, director of the trauma center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, who was featured in a ''Trauma'' episode, says: ''The pleasure in seeing a fictional medical show is kind of like the pleasure in watching a James Bond movie. You get to suspend reality for a while. With these shows, it's just the opposite. You see real people doing real jobs. You see people caring for those who are down on their physical luck.''</p>
        <p>THE fact is, few professions are shrouded in as much mystery as medicine. ''There used to be this feeling that doctors are like the Almighty Oz,'' Dr. DuPree says. ''These shows on the air now take down the curtain to show that, in a way, doctors aren't that special. We are people. And we're not treating an illness. We're treating a patient with an illness. And I think everyone benefits from that.''</p>
        <p>This may help explain why hospitals are increasingly willing to say yes when producers for these shows seek permission to film. Still, what about the patients? Is there anything so personal that it won't eventually wind up on television? Dr. Corlin of the A.M.A. is convinced ''this is just a phase that we'll go through and then see diminish.'' The Health Network's Mr. Krigsman insists that the shows should not broadcast anything ''that would hurt those of us who are trying to do legitimate medical series.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Dr. Stanley Biber in Trinidad, Colo., has been getting calls recently from a few outlets whose names he can't recall, checking to see whether he'd be willing to allow camera crews in his operating room. And what is Dr. Biber's surgical specialty? Sex changes.</p>
