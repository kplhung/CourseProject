        <p>BECCO  ++  (212) 397-7597; 355 West 46th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues; $$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Becco's dependable Italian food is served in two ways. You choose a caesar salad or antipasto plate and then either unlimited servings of the three pastas of the day, or any of a dozen enticing main courses. Some of these main courses include grilled salmon over braised fennel, black olives, arugula and warm citrus vinaigrette; pan-fried breaded chicken breast with tomato salad; grilled swordfish served with spring potatoes and a puttanesca sauce; braised veal shank with barley risotto, fava beans and green peas; and grilled black angus rib eye, dry rubbed with porcini mushrooms, served with garlic mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables.

        <p>BRASSERIEBIT  ++  (212) 869-4440; 258 West 44th Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues; $$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This restaurant takes its name from Bitburger, a venerable German beer that is the brasserie's signature brew. Appetizers include jumbo lump crab cakes with spicy remoulade; duck and foie gras terrine with lentil salad; and grilled lobster pizza with melted leeks and oven roasted tomato. Entrees include grilled prawns and sweet pea and morel risotto, with pea leaves and chervil butter; garlic roasted pork shank with a tangle of greens and creamy polenta; and porcini roasted farm chicken, caramelized root vegetables and potato shallot puree. (Article: 5/12/99)</p>
        <p>ESCA  ++  (212) 564-7272; 402 West 43rd Street, at Ninth Avenue; $$$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>In a city that has seen seafood in every possible form, it takes a little ingenuity to make the idea of fish seem fresh. This latest production from Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich (the team behind Babbo, Becco, Lupa and Po) pulls off the trick by giving the food a regional Italian focus. Starters include diver scallops  with tangerine oil; wild king salmon, seared with tarragon and black pepper; and mahi-mahi marinated with key lime and blood oranges. Entrees include risotto with crab and scallions; shrimp and sorrel ravioli with nettle butter; whole roasted black bass with olives and caperberries; and poached halibut with Maine rope mussels and roasted spring onions. (Diner's Journal: 5/19/00)</p>
        <p>LOCAL  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 921-2005; 224 West 47th Street, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue; $$$; www.localnyc.com; smoking at the lounge; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Local bills itself as a casual hangout, the late-20th-century equivalent of a corner cafe. Some cafe. The cooking is generally American style with international touches. Appetizers include crawfish raviolette with toasted almonds; Vidalia onion and black olive tart; and ahi tuna tartare and hamachi sashimi. Entrees include pan-roasted sea scallops with crab cakes and sweet corn chowder; pan-roasted Maine lobster, served with crispy grits cake and sweet corn succotash; and honey-miso lacquered Chatham cod with pickled shallots, bamboo shoots and flageolet. (Review: 10/6/99)</p>
        <p>PALLADIN  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 320-2929; 224 West 49th Street, at Broadway; $$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Palladin is a techno-bistro with a lot of sass and style. Appetizers include ahi and hamachi carpaccio with micro greens and Asian cucumber salad; Florida conch tempura with green mango and red ginger coulis; and duck ravioli with meat jus. Main dishes include Florida swordfish, served with red beet julienne, citrus coulis, mire poix of lemon and orange confit; venison loin with grapes, verjus sauce and roasted kobacha squash; and oxtail crepinette with bone marrow, red wine sauce and chestnut puree. (Review: 6/23/99)</p>
        <p>YA BOWL  +  (212) 764-3017; 125 West 45th Street, between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenues; $$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This sweet little Japanese restaurant on the fringe of Times Square could almost be mistaken for a New York living room. The raison d'etre of Ya Bowl is the bowl meals, one-pot meals in which hot food is served over rice in a bowl, a delicious and economical method. Appetizers include golden fried soy bean curd tossed in kochujan oyster sauce and served on a bed of organic mixed greens; green asparagus rolled in thin sliced marinated tender beef and seared; and diced Chinese eggplant fried to tender and seasoned with slightly spicy soy vinaigrette.  Entrees include broiled chicken breast served with teriyaki glaze and seasonal vegetables; assorted fresh seafood simmered in the chef's special brown curry sauce, served with seasonal vegetables; and seafood tossed with linguine and your choice of marinara sauce or spicy cod roe butter.
