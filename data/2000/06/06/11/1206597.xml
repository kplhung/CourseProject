      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial criticizes House's 279-136 vote to repeal federal estate tax, ostensibly to aid families that might be forced to sell the family farm or business to pay 'death tax'; contends it would be better to simply raise the exclusion for such families to $4 million</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Seldom have so many voted for a gargantuan tax cut for so few. The House voted overwhelmingly Friday, 279 to 136, to repeal the federal estate tax -- a tax so focused on the rich that it hits only about 2 percent of all estates. Sponsors claimed to be acting on behalf of families who inherit a family farm or business only to find that they are forced to sell the property to pay the ''death tax.'' But among the estates that are now subject to taxation, only about 3 percent are farms or family businesses, and there are better ways to get relief to them.</p>
        <p>Estate taxes are not imposed on inheritances under $675,000, and that exemption will rise to $1 million by 2006, or $2 million for couples with some planning. The very rich pay almost all of the tax. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, about half of the tax is paid by the weathiest one-thousandth of the people who die. The code already provides a variety of special allowances for family farms and businesses, including an exemption of $1.3 million.</p>

        <p>Seldom have so many voted for a gargantuan tax cut for so few. The House voted overwhelmingly Friday, 279 to 136, to repeal the federal estate tax -- a tax so focused on the rich that it hits only about 2 percent of all estates. Sponsors claimed to be acting on behalf of families who inherit a family farm or business only to find that they are forced to sell the property to pay the ''death tax.'' But among the estates that are now subject to taxation, only about 3 percent are farms or family businesses, and there are better ways to get relief to them.</p>
        <p>Estate taxes are not imposed on inheritances under $675,000, and that exemption will rise to $1 million by 2006, or $2 million for couples with some planning. The very rich pay almost all of the tax. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, about half of the tax is paid by the weathiest one-thousandth of the people who die. The code already provides a variety of special allowances for family farms and businesses, including an exemption of $1.3 million.</p>
        <p>Abolishing the estate tax would have severe consequences. When fully phased in, the bill would cost about $50 billion a year. Repeal would also threaten the nation's finest universities and museums. Wealthy families no longer facing estate taxes might well decide to leave more money to their families, and less to charity.</p>
        <p>The Democrats offered a more-than-reasonable alternative. Their plan would cut the estate tax rates by 20 percent, a gesture to the political pressures, and raise the exclusion for couples owning family farms and businesses to $4 million to better help the supposed targets of this legislation. Yet the House swatted the alternative aside, demonstrating that a large majority of members were less concerned with rescuing family farms and businesses than with enriching their wealthiest supporters.</p>
