        <p>Union leaders representing 300,000 New York City municipal workers say their members are growing increasingly angry about the lack of progress in labor negotiations that could be one of the last big tests of Rudolph W. Giuliani's mayoralty.</p>
        <p>The contracts of half the city's work force have already expired, and the leaders say their unions may hold large demonstrations outside City Hall if the negotiations do not show significant progress soon.</p>
        <p>The municipal unions have taken the position that Mr. Giuliani should be especially generous in this round of negotiations because the city has projected a $3.2 billion budget surplus and because city workers had accepted a two-year wage freeze in their previous contract.</p>
        <p>''Clearly there is economic prosperity in the city,'' said Lee Saunders, the trustee running District Council 37, the umbrella union representing 125,000 municipal workers. ''Our members sacrificed in the past when the city was experiencing financial difficulties. Our members made sacrifices in their wages and pension funds, and now that the city is in strong financial shape, we should be rewarded with increased wages and benefits.''</p>
        <p>In interviews, the leaders of the city's largest municipal unions said they saw one major obstacle to progress in the talks: Mr. Giuliani's demand that there be no across-the-board wage increase, but instead individualized merit increases in which some workers would receive no raise while others might receive up to 6 percent a year. Several union leaders denounced the mayor's proposal, saying it would leave many workers without raises and would create tensions between union members who receive merit raises and those who do not.</p>
        <p>''It's not realistic to ask our members to accept a system of individualized merit pay,'' said Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. ''Every police officer should get a merit pay increase because every police officer did work that helped bring about a substantial reduction in crime.''</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, also criticized the mayor's proposal, saying: ''There's not one union in the City of New York that will accept a contract without a pay increase for all of its members. Ultimately, if the mayor stays on this course of individualized merit pay or nothing, then nobody's going to do a contract with him, and then it's clear to me that he's just not serious about bargaining.''</p>
        <p>But Deputy Mayor Robert M. Harding insisted that Mr. Giuliani was indeed serious about bargaining. ''He's already shown his ability to negotiate with the unions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harding said that in the last round of citywide bargaining, Mr. Giuliani and the city's unions successfully negotiated a five-year contract that included a no-layoff clause, a two-year wage freeze and a 12 percent increase over the last three years. He also noted that the city reached a pension agreement with the unions just two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>That agreement, which would require state legislation to take effect, would reduce the percentage of annual salary that city workers contribute to their pensions each year by about 3 percent. In return, the unions approved a plan to let the city use $808 million from unexpectedly high investment profits from union pension funds. The one-time windfall would be used in the city's operating budget.</p>
        <p>Some labor experts say that some of that money may be used to finance a labor contract (each 1 percent wage increase in the city's payroll costs about $160 million). Several experts said they expected that Mr. Giuliani would eventually make a fallback proposal that included a modest wage increase for all employees and individual merit increases on top of that. In the handful of negotiating sessions held so far, the unions have demanded a substantial wage increase without specifying a percentage.</p>
        <p>James F. Hanley, the city's labor commissioner, said the recently negotiated pension agreement created a spirit of cooperation that could give some momentum to the collective bargaining. He added that the unions would feel some pressure to reach an agreement because their members would not see reductions in their pension contributions until an overall labor agreement was reached.</p>
        <p>But he would not predict when an agreement might be reached.</p>
        <p>''We're still in the early stages,'' Mr. Hanley said.</p>
        <p>Some union leaders said Mr. Giuliani's decision not to run for the United States Senate would make it easier to reach an agreement, suggesting that Mr. Giuliani had taken his hard-line approach to bargaining as a campaign strategy to please upstate Republicans and conservative donors from outside New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's aides said, however, that the mayor had adopted his merit pay proposal because he considered it the best way to make the city's work force more productive. Good workers, these aides said, would be rewarded while unproductive workers might be persuaded to shape up or leave the city's work force.</p>
        <p>Norman Adler, a political consultant, said the mayor's withdrawal from the Senate race could make it harder to reach a labor agreement. He said that as a candidate, the mayor might have pushed for contracts to win the backing of several unions, most likely the firefighter and police unions, or to neutralize them.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he wanted to have any union job actions to take place while he was a candidate,'' Mr. Adler said. ''You want to keep the seas as smooth as possible while you're sailing toward Election Day. Now that he's not running, he can play this game any way he wants. There are no electoral consequences.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Weingarten, who is chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Coalition, which coordinates bargaining for all the city's unions, said the unions had a plan calling for them to step up pressure on the city if there was no agreement soon. Her union, which represents more than 80,000 teachers and guidance counselors, is planning to picket at city schools on June 21 and has started a $3 million advertising campaign about the need for higher teacher pay.</p>
        <p>''They have a $3.2 billion surplus,'' she said. ''They have money for labor negotiations this year. They should just do a contract. If not, the unions will continue to escalate their public campaign to win a good contract.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harding gave City Hall's response to such a pressure campaign. ''That's a threat,'' he said. ''We don't respond to threats.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harding took sharp issue with statements that much of the surplus should be devoted to large wage increases. ''If you took the city's surpluses and you spent it on any one thing,'' he said, ''you would have such large deficits in future years that you wouldn't be able to keep the budgetary commitments that we made this year.''</p>
        <p>Carroll Haynes, president of Teamsters Local 237, which represents 20,000 Housing Authority workers and other city employees, insisted that municipal workers should benefit from the surplus after having endured a wage freeze, pension givebacks and layoffs to help restore the city's financial health.</p>
        <p>''Our motto right now is, 'We shared in the pain over a five-year period, now we wish to share in the gains of a $3 billion surplus,' '' Mr. Haynes said.</p>
        <p>One of Local 237's contracts with the city expired on Dec. 31 and the other on March 31. District Council 37's contract expired March 31. The contract of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association expires July 31, while the teachers' contract expires Oct. 31.</p>
        <p>State law bars teachers and other government employees from striking.</p>
