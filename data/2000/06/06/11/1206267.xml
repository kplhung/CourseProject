        <p>The characters in Joan Silber's first collection of short stories, IN MY OTHER LIFE (Sarabande, cloth, $21.95; paper, $13.95), are almost all New Yorkers, but not the self-absorbed, ambitious, cell-phone-toting kind. These are plain-spoken middle-aged people, just trying to get by, who imagine themselves better off in another life. In this life, they are drug counselors, bartenders, video store managers and real estate agents; never married, working on second marriages, trying to raise children. They don't consider themselves failures, but realize they might be seen that way. In ''Bobby Jackson,'' the 40-ish narrator looks back on his youth as a bartender, when he experimented with heroin and felt ''drowned in love'' with a waitress named Nancy. That he survived those reckless years is not alarming, just true. ''I was not afraid to die,'' he says plainly. ''I had the dreamy curiosity about death that small children have.'' Now, in the calm of middle age, he is someone ''who takes great private pleasure in things around me. On some days my own apartment seems like a vale of peace and light.'' There's a lot to be said for holding on to what you've got, Silber tells us. In ''Lake Natasink,'' an unconventional relationship is portrayed with quiet honesty and humor. Patty and her lover Charlotte are moving upstate with their newly adopted baby, and tension arises over the transition. Tired of arguing, ''They sit down quietly. They watch the news.'' Silber, the author of two previous novels, treats dysfunction a bit more gently than Lorrie Moore, with whom she shares a marvelous, perspicacious wit. Her characters struggle to keep going, however slowly, without losing their dignity. If they lack fulfillment, memories of old longings seem to suffice. These elegant and wise stories pay tribute to ordinary urban heroes -- people who have lived long enough to know that when misfortune shows up, there's no need to make a fuss.</p>
