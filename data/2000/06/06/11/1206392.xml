        <p>SURE, I've thrown a Frisbee before, but not like this. Thick rows of trees jutted out to either side of me, their leafy tendrils growing longer by the minute. In disk-golf parlance, I faced a dogleg right to a Pole Hole nearly 180 feet away and to the left, tucked behind a distant copse.</p>
        <p>I stood on the ''amateur tee,'' a patch of brown dirt. Seventy feet behind me, my partners had already teed off. For Sunil Mehta, a top Connecticut amateur, and L. Kraig Steffen, a chemistry professor who plays disk golf professionally, throwing a disk 250 yards is a given. The challenge is making the disk curve as it comes down so it lands near the target.</p>

        <p>SURE, I've thrown a Frisbee before, but not like this. Thick rows of trees jutted out to either side of me, their leafy tendrils growing longer by the minute. In disk-golf parlance, I faced a dogleg right to a Pole Hole nearly 180 feet away and to the left, tucked behind a distant copse.</p>
        <p>I stood on the ''amateur tee,'' a patch of brown dirt. Seventy feet behind me, my partners had already teed off. For Sunil Mehta, a top Connecticut amateur, and L. Kraig Steffen, a chemistry professor who plays disk golf professionally, throwing a disk 250 yards is a given. The challenge is making the disk curve as it comes down so it lands near the target.</p>
        <p>Dr. Steffen's disk arced past a hanging bough, dropping within easy birdie range. Mr. Mehta's drive found the trees. Now it was my turn.</p>
        <p>Taking a breath, I let it rip. It had been a while. The disk flew straight but low, nosing itself into the ground 50 yards away.</p>
        <p>''That was good, keeping it low like that,'' Mr. Steffen said, as if I actually planned that. Dr. Steffen has a reputation for being a disk-golf evangelist, and with his constant encouragement during an often-desultory round, it was easy to see why.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehta started his day packing a vinyl carry-on case with disks, 14 in all. ''I really only need 13, but that's bad luck,'' Mr. Mehta said.</p>
        <p>Some disks, thin with sharp edges, are ''drivers,'' designed to sail long distances. Approach disks are rounder and allow for more control. There are many variations of these. Finally, there are ''putters,'' softer and smaller than the others, designed to flutter gently into the basket.</p>
        <p>Carrying so many disks comes in handy when you begin losing them. I lost two of Mr. Mehta's, one a putter, the other a tiny disk used as a marker for between shots.</p>
        <p>Losing someone's putter is a definite faux pas in real golf, but Mr. Mehta shrugged it off. ''I lose disks all the time,'' he shrugged. ''When people find them, it's like you're passing on the game.''</p>
        <p>There are many similarities between the two games. Both embrace a ''play-it-where-it-lays'' philosophy. One shot left me standing in the middle of a brier patch, another next to a clump of poison ivy.</p>
        <p>''Disk golf is easier to learn than ball golf,'' Dr. Steffen said. ''The learning curve isn't as steep. But when it comes to mastering the game, disk golf is every bit as hard.''</p>
        <p>My play improved after the front nine. There's a trick to letting the disk come off the hand in such a way that it produces a straight flight, a pivoting motion of shoulder and wrist very similar to what ball golfers learn when trying to keep the blade of their club straight during the downswing. I also concentrated on getting the disk close to the basket rather than inside it.</p>
        <p>Finally, at No. 17, a hard dogleg left, I managed to launch a drive that soared far and true. Watching it land 15 feet from the pin was to understand a little of the elation Dr. Steffen and Mr. Mehta spoke of.</p>
        <p>I was left with a short pitch for birdie. I threw a delicate beauty that caught the rays of the noonday sun as it hovered an instant just over the basket's mouth. Then it fell, ricocheted off the head of the pole, and landed behind some mulberry bushes 20 feet away.</p>
        <p>I settled for double bogey. Disk golf and ball golf have something else in common: They can be cruel.</p>
