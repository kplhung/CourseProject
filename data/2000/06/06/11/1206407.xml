        <p>How interesting it was to read about the new young German playwrights [''In Germany, Youth Takes the Stage'' by Brendan Greeley, May 28].

When writers from a country with one of the most tumultuous and complex histories of the 20th century say, ''I'm not interested in realistically depicting the ills of society,'' and, ''I think the most interesting thing about people is that they're irrational,'' we can't fail to see that something is very, very wrong in their lack of ambivalence.</p>

        <p>How interesting it was to read about the new young German playwrights [''In Germany, Youth Takes the Stage'' by Brendan Greeley, May 28]. Most notable, and devastating, was the pride the writers took in their ahistorical perspective. When writers from a country with one of the most tumultuous and complex histories of the 20th century say, ''I'm not interested in realistically depicting the ills of society,'' and, ''I think the most interesting thing about people is that they're irrational,'' we can't fail to see that something is very, very wrong in their lack of ambivalence.</p>
        <p>Though Brecht and Kroetz were mentioned, not one of the writers or directors interviewed mentioned the great German playwright Heiner Muller. If today's new German playwrights aren't interested in his ambitious, political plays, it reveals their supposed theatrical revolution for what it is: an inability to confront a daunting historical legacy. A theater without a past is a theater without a future.</p>

        <p>The writer's play ''Other People'' was presented by the Royal Court Theater in London this spring.</p>
