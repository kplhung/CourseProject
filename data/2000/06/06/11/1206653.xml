        <p>At the 1-mile mark of the New York Mini Marathon yesterday, the official race truck ordered the police motorcycle escort and the vehicle carrying the news media to speed it up.</p>
        <p>''They're catching up,'' the driver barked over the microphone.</p>
        <p>He should have said she's catching up.</p>
        <p>Tegla Loroupe, the Kenyan waif, was about 100 yards ahead of a pack and gaining on the truck of the New York Road Runners Club, the race's sponsor. Fading behind was an elite group: fellow Kenyan, Catherine Ndereba, winner of the 2000 Boston Marathon; Adriana Fernandez, the reigning New York Marathon champion; and Ethiopia's Fatuma Roba, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist in the marathon.</p>
        <p>It was a one-woman race with Loroupe setting a record pace of 4 minutes 58 seconds through the first mile and running the second fastest 5-mile pace on the 6.2 mile course in Central Park to win her fifth Mini Marathon title in a time of 31:37. It was the fifth-fastest time in the 29-year history of the women's-only race.</p>
        <p>No one in the Olympic-caliber field was ready, willing or able to match Loroupe's quick, easy stride. Ndereba finished second in of 32:22 -- 45 seconds behind -- and Roba crossed the finish line in 32:25 for third place.</p>
        <p>''I know Tegla has good speed and likes her own place, so I was looking to go as fast as she was going and that's why I became No. 2,'' Ndereba said. ''I tried to beat myself and stay close to Tegla.''</p>
        <p>And to think Loroupe, who was running with a headache brought on by the 78-degree temperature at the 9 a.m. start of the race, said she actually tried to slow the pace because she didn't want to ''take advantage'' of the field.</p>
        <p>''I was trying to run because I knew the weather was going to be a factor and I had a headache,'' Loroupe said. ''I was feeling good, however. When I'm feeling good I don't want to take advantage of my colleagues. So when you're in a good field, I always try to support one another and not run against.''</p>
        <p>Once she took the lead, Loroupe said she knew the race was hers to win after 3 kilometers because the crowd lining the route was shouting that she was about 20 meters ahead.</p>
        <p>''My fans were shouting all the way, so I had a little strength,'' said Loroupe, who was joined by her younger sister, Emily, who finished 20th. Another sister, Gladys, 18, was watching from the stands.</p>
        <p>Anne-Marie Lauck of Milton, N.J., a 1994 winner of the Mini Marathon, finished ninth in 34:11. Lauck said she ran a bad race and was frustrated by her results.</p>
        <p>''I'm really miffed,'' said Lauck, who plans to the compete in the 10,000-meter Olympic trials next month. ''I felt very fatigued and had problems breathing. I have to go back to the drawing board.''</p>
        <p>But others in the field, considered one of the fastest ever assembled, were encouraged by their performances. Ndereba said her finish bodes well for her chances of making the Kenyan Olympic team in the 10,000 meters. The trials will be held next month. Roba, already a member of the Ethiopian women's Olympic marathon team, said the race showed she has ''good speed for the marathon.''</p>
        <p>Fernandez appeared to labor on the hilly stretches of the course, but still managed to cross the finish line in fifth place in 32:44.</p>
        <p>More than 3,000 runners competed in the event. The race offered $30,000 in prize money, with a first place of $8,000 going to Loroupe.</p>
