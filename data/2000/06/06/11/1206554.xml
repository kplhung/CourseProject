      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article last Sunday about a line of shirts and ties bearing the name of Regis Philbin, the television personality, misstated the date of an appearance he is scheduled to make at Macy's Herald Square to promote the collection. It is tomorrow; it was not June 5.</p>
        <p>The article also misidentified the owner of the Botany 500 clothing label, which was marketed using television personalities of the 1960's. It is McGregor II LLC; Men's Wearhouse makes men's wear with the Botany 500 label under license.</p>
