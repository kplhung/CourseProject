        <p>Two renovations have brought a bold postmodern twist to New Orleans's upscale hotel scene, where furnishings tend to be antique, real or fake, fabrics are often flowery, and charm has long been mandatory.</p>
        <p>The more visible of the hotels is the W New Orleans in the Central Business District, formerly a Sheraton Four Points and a neighbor of Harrah's new casino. Nearby, the W New Orleans-French Quarter is a dramatic remake of the Hotel de la Poste.</p>
        <p>But neither of the hotels, both of which opened officially on May 11, is without a trace of Louisiana culture. Beyond the striking red and gold velvets, black leather and oversize chrome tick-tack-toe games in the small reception area of the W in the French Quarter, there are voodoo dolls for sale in the guest rooms' snack bars, for $7 each. The same is true of the W in the Central Business District, where there is a marble-and-glass staircase and a backgammon set made of cloth, and chaises longues sit legless in the playfully decorated lobby.</p>
        <p>As in other W properties, both the 98-unit French Quarter hotel and its sibling, which has 400 guest rooms and 23 suites, are furnished with beds outfitted with pillow-topped mattresses and down comforters. The rooms' 27-inch television sets are equipped with wireless keyboards offering fast Internet access.</p>
        <p>At the downtown W, the signature restaurant is Zoe Bistrot, where the cuisine is French. In a room off the lobby, Whiskey Blue is a relative of cocktail lounges in Manhattan and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>At the French Quarter W, an Italian-style restaurant, Bacco, run by the Brennan family, who run Commander's Palace, is a holdover from the Hotel de la Poste.</p>
        <p>Rates at the W New Orleans-French Quarter, 316 Chartres Street, (504) 581-1200, fax (504) 522-3208, start at $139; in high season (roughly fall, winter and early spring), $199 to $339.</p>
        <p>At the W New Orleans, 333 Poydras Street, (504) 525-9444, fax (504) 581-7179, rates start at $129; in high season, $179 to $339. Both hotels have pools; the W New Orleans has a fitness center.</p>
