        <p>THE films that I want to do are perceived as a little bit risky and dark,'' the director Alison Maclean says. Now that is an understatement.</p>
        <p>Ms. Maclean languished in director hell after her debut feature, the defiantly noirish psychological thriller ''Crush,'' which she shot in New Zealand in 1992, piqued the interest of a number of American critics and producers. ''I moved to New York right after 'Crush' and have spent most of the last eight years writing three feature scripts,'' she says. ''Two seemed like they were almost fully financed, then fell apart. It's definitely been a frustrating time. Then this came at me from left field.''</p>
        <p>''This'' is ''Jesus' Son,'' an adaptation of Denis Johnson's collection of interwoven short stories about alienation, ennui and drugs in the American heartland in the 70's, which Ms. Maclean shot early last year in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Arizona. It has proved to be a godsend, pardon the expression. Not only did it offer her the chance to get back behind the camera for a feature film, it successfully transcended its $2.5 million budget. It has received excellent reviews at the Venice and Toronto Film Festivals and at the recent New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art. (Lions Gate will open the film on Friday.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Maclean, a tall, lean, slightly androgynous woman who looks a lot younger than her 41 years, is sitting in the living room of her unpretentious West Village apartment, which is ultraminimalist save for a bit of furniture and several sculptures she made as an art student in New Zealand. She says she was approached by the co-producers and screenwriters of ''Jesus' Son,'' Elizabeth Cuthrell and David Urrutia, who had just optioned the book. They had seen ''Crush'' and Ms. Maclean's 1989 short, ''Kitchen Sink,'' and considered her a perfect match for the material.</p>
        <p>''We wanted someone who could create a strong sense of tension that could link Denis's fragmented stories,'' Ms. Cuthrell says. ''We called Alison. She called back in 10 minutes and said: 'You don't understand. This is a book I dearly love.' We met the next day, and that was that.''</p>
        <p>The finished film is fragmented, though accessibly so. Its structure mimics the mind-set of its protagonist (Billy Crudup), a heroin user/drinker/petty thief /voyeur/layabout with an unprintable nickname -- its initials are F. H. -- while he makes his way across the United States trying to find himself. Essentially an innocent, F. H. is also a spiritual seeker. (The film's title comes from Lou Reed's lyrics to the Velvet Underground song ''Heroin.'') He encounters a motley assortment of wacky, amoral guys, like Georgie (Jack Black), a hilariously incompetent emergency room orderly with whom F. H. works as they pop uppers and downers simultaneously.</p>
        <p>F. H. falls in love with Michelle (Samantha Morton), a tragic young woman who also shoots up regularly and is the character closest to those in Ms. Maclean's own scripts. F. H. hallucinates all sorts of things, often objects with religious associations. His fantasies are not surreal or heavily exaggerated in the style of Terry Gilliam's ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' or the psychedelic films of the 60's. They are more akin to what Ms. Maclean calls ''a slightly heightened reality, part of the fabric of daily life.'' On a snowy night, F. H. walks through a drive-in movie theater dotted with car-speaker stands and experiences it as a cemetery with gravestone crosses. In the film's central scene, he imagines a sacred heart emerging from the chest of a thin, scruffy man whom he's followed from the Chicago El into a laundromat.</p>
        <p>Ms. Maclean says that the religious iconography of the book and the script was one of the project's main attractions. She is interested in Buddhism. Her mother, Mary Forrest, a potter, lives the spiritual life in a New Age sort of way, to the point where, according to one of Ms. Maclean's old friends, she dangles crystals over her food before eating. (Ms. Maclean's parents divorced when she was a teenager.) Her maternal grandfather, on the other hand, was a Christadelphian, a strict fundamentalist who taught his family to deny themselves pleasure (including movies) and placed Christ-affirming banners on his front lawn. Those probably would have caught F. H.'s eye.</p>
        <p>''Another thing I liked about the project is that there is a lot of comedy in it, and a lot of optimism as well,'' says Ms. Maclean, who, for someone with such a somber oeuvre and reserved demeanor, has a deep, endearing laugh. The humor in ''Jesus' Son'' is very black, but the film is far less disturbing than her earlier work (in addition to ''Crush'' and ''Kitchen Sink,'' she wrote and directed four shorts in New Zealand), and those screenplays over which she has been laboring in New York.</p>
        <p>She is willing to go for lighter fare -- she directed the first two episodes of ''Sex and the City'' for HBO -- but her own sensibilities lead her on precarious journeys into the unconscious. ''I do choose the difficult path,'' she says. ''I'm not sure why.''</p>
        <p>Some clues are provided by Bridget Ikin, a New Zealander who lives in Sydney, Australia, and a close friend; she produced ''Crush'' and three of Ms. Maclean's shorts. ''For me, the journey that Alison's taken to New York, living as a single woman, hacking it out for eight years now, has been beyond,'' Ms. Ikin says. ''We could have happily continued to make films together, but Alison always goes for the hard option. I don't think it's any coincidence that one of the projects that took her to the States was a film from her own script of 'Moby-Dick.' '' (Ms. Maclean's version, which she says she ''hijacked,'' has a female Ishmael.)</p>
        <p>A LISON is a troubled person, embattled with demons that she's dealing with,'' Ms. Ikin adds. Like several other longtime associates of Ms. Maclean, Ms. Ikin feels that she suffers for her art. ''What interested me about the work I produced for her was her use of personal material,'' she says. ''The scripting for 'Crush' was a completely torturous process.</p>
        <p>'' 'Crush' was about an anxious moment in her relationship with New Zealand, about her sense of alienation from that culture, about female sexuality and desire, about shifting sexuality and about shifting power relationships.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Maclean says: ''There's something ominous in me somewhere. I love the warts-and-all people.'' The two main characters in ''Crush,'' both women, are a New Zealand journalist, Christina (Donogh Rees), and an American opportunist, Lane (Marcia Gay Harden), who just might be lovers. Lane is responsible for Christina's becoming paralyzed in a car accident; she then abandons Christina and assumes her identity to gain access to -- and ultimately have a love affair with -- a noted author, Colin (William Zappa), who lives with his teenage daughter, Angela (Caitlin Bossley). Angela becomes lovingly obsessed with Lane, then does a flip and begins to intensely hate her. At film's end, the severely damaged Christina musters the energy to climb out of her wheelchair and, just when you think she's going to hug and forgive Lane, she shoves her off a cliff, an incident witnessed by the horrified Angela.</p>
        <p>According to Ms. Ikin: ''Alison is the young girl, Angela, desiring the powerful American woman. America is this metaphor of power and desire, the longing to be in the other, more exotic, unreachable place. In fact, Alison's never felt at home in any country.''</p>
        <p>''Jesus' Son'' reflects its director's outsider status. ''I think the film has a European sensibility,'' says Ms. Maclean, who lived in Canada, New Zealand and Australia before moving to New York. ''It's in the framing, in the way there is a certain distance or detachment, a certain remove, which is really my temperament.''</p>
        <p>On the commercial front, her feelings of estrangement have resulted in collisions with some powerful people. She came to the United States at the behest of Disney's Touchstone Pictures, with the idea of developing projects. The one that most appealed to her was ''Up Close and Personal'' (eventually directed by Jon Avnet, starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert Redford). ''I read Alanna Nash's 'Golden Girl,' '' Ms. Maclean says. ''It was about the TV anchorwoman Jessica Savitch, who had a bad cocaine habit and died young in this freak car accident with her boyfriend. It was dark and tragic. I was interested in the real story. But Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne, who at that point had written a few drafts of the screenplay, were interested in 'The Star Is Born' element for the film. They turned Savitch into an ingenue.'' (Mr. Dunne's 1997 book ''Monster'' lays at least some of the blame on Touchstone executives.)</p>
        <p>''Touchstone and I agreed that we disagreed,'' she continues. ''It was a perfectly amicable parting of the ways.''</p>
        <p>Not so with ''Bedlam.'' Ms. Maclean was hired by the producer Ruth Charney to rewrite a John Sayles script based on an atmospheric 1946 thriller produced by the legendary Val Lewton, and then direct the film. ''Bedlam'' was to be a vehicle for the actress Illeana Douglas, then the girlfriend of Martin Scorsese, who was the executive producer. Set in the 18th century, it is the tale of a Quaker who tries to expose the conditions inside an insane asylum and who himself becomes an inmate. Ms. Douglas was to play his love interest. ''Alison was attracted to all aspects of it,'' Ms. Charney says. ''It had a lot of morality lessons.'' After much tinkering, Ms. Maclean finally gave up trying to tailor the screenplay to suit Ms. Douglas.</p>
        <p>''Alison didn't see Illeana in the role, and that is where it all broke down,'' Ms. Charney says. ''Alison is a very moral person, so she told Marty herself. She was willing to risk her career to do that. She's incredibly pure that way.'' According to several people who were involved, Mr. Scorsese hit the roof. (Both he and Ms. Maclean have declined to elaborate.)</p>
        <p>NOW that the reception for ''Jesus' Son'' has changed her luck, Ms. Maclean has been able to begin her next project, ''Iris,'' the third of the scripts gathering dust at home. To be financed by New York's Good Machine and Britain's FilmFour, and produced by Good Machine's Ted Hope, the film could go into production as early as the end of the year.</p>
        <p>''Iris'' is a contemporary, supernatural, psychological tale ''about a woman who starts remembering things from her childhood that didn't happen,'' Ms. Maclean says. ''One of the things it deals with is sexual abuse of a child as a metaphor. The deep dark secret of the family turns out to be that there is not a dark secret.'' But the film is dark nonetheless, and that sounds like Alison Maclean at her most deliciously unadulterated.</p>
