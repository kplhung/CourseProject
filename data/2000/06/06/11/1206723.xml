        <p>In the first move made since the state took over the financial operations of Camden last month, Municipal Prosecutor Patricia Bowen Atkins was fired last week after the discovery in her office of uncashed checks and unfilled requests for trial information dating from late 1998, as well as three months of unopened mail. On May 10 the state took over the financial operation of the city because of gross fiscal mismanagement. The situation in Ms. Atkins's office was uncovered after a city police officer refused a request to shred documents from the office, according to Lee Solomon, Camden County prosecutor.</p>
