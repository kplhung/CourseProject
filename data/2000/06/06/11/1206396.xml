        <p>TO Fred Silverman, what has happened to the network television documentary is scandalous.</p>
        <p>''It's really sad that no major networks or cable companies are making public affairs programs,'' he said. ''We've lost a piece of our humanity, and a small measure of this is that these types of shows aren't out there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverman, a Bedford Hills resident, has been producing and directing documentary films since 1978, and his latest, ''Health Care Crisis: Who's at Risk,'' will be shown on PBS on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>A self-described product of the 60's, Mr. Silverman has always been interested in social activism. After a brief career as a teacher of broadcast and media studies, he joined CBS and in 1979 began work on his first production, ''Sunrise Semester,'' a daily educational series, which went on the air without commercials.</p>
        <p>''At CBS they believed that TV was more than just a delivery system for entertainment,'' Mr. Silverman said. ''We wanted to serve the public interest.''</p>
        <p>In 1985, Mr. Silverman -- who is not related to the Fred Silverman who was president of NBC -- founded Silverman Communications, an independent production company, and continued to produce films and television programs on social issues.</p>
        <p>While making his last production for PBS, ''Living With Cancer: A Message of Hope,'' which was broadcast in the fall of 1998, Mr. Silverman said that ''so many ethical issues were raised, so I really wanted to do a show'' about the health care system, with particular attention to the 44 million Americans without insurance.</p>
        <p>''What we wanted to do with this latest film,'' he said, ''was to take the health care crisis and explain to the American people where we came from, where we are and where we're going.''</p>
        <p>The average one-hour documentary, he said, costs $300,000 to $500,000 to produce, and it is hard to obtain financing. ''It's all about money,'' Mr. Silverman said, ''No corporations would help us with funding, not in an election year.''</p>
        <p>To attract more foundation money, Mr. Silverman formed a nonprofit organization, Issues TV, which develops programs focusing on social issues.</p>
        <p>The new film is the organization's first project. Financing for the film came from the Greenwall Foundation in New York and the Health Care Foundation of New Jersey.</p>
