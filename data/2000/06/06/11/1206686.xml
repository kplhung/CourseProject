        <p>For the Clinton administration, the death of President Hafez al-Assad of Syria makes the possibility of brokering a peace between the Israelis and  Syrians even more remote and the desire to help forge a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians even more intense.</p>
        <p>Since the Syrian leader and President Clinton failed to come to terms at a meeting in Geneva last March,  the administration has underscored  the urgency of making peace between Israelis and Palestinians. In Cairo on Wednesday, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright told Syrian and Egyptian officials that while the administration was willing to make a final push for an Israeli-Syrian peace, there was ''no higher foreign policy priority'' for it than the peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Those talks were to resume in the Washington area on Tuesday and the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, Yasir Arafat, had been scheduled to meet with Mr. Clinton at the White House on Wednesday. But it was not clear whether those meetings might be delayed because of Mr. Assad's funeral, which is also scheduled for Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton will not go to Syria for the funeral, his spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said. Although attending  the funeral would present the president with a chance to greet Mr. Assad's son as he assumes power, the United States will instead be represented by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said that they have compiled a thick dossier on Bashar Assad but maintained only limited contacts with him through the embassy in Damascus. A senior White House official said that nothing Bashar Assad had said or done in recent months had caused the United States to believe that he would radically alter Syria's course internally or in regional relations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton learned of Mr. Assad's death before he took the stage for a commencement address at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn. During the ceremony, an aide slipped the president a note saying that Syrian television had reported the death. Mr. Clinton visibly sighed and shook his head as he read the note.</p>
        <p>Afterwards he told reporters that this was a time for condolences to the Assad family and the people of Syria, not for make predictions about the future of a Middle East peace.</p>
        <p>''While we had our disagreements,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''I always respected him because I felt that he was open and straightforward with me, and because I felt he meant it when he said he had made a strategic choice for peace.''</p>
        <p>''I regret that that peace was not achieved in his lifetime,'' the president added, ''and I hope that it can still be achieved, in no small measure because of the commitment he made.''</p>
        <p>In response to questions, Mr. Clinton said it was ''premature to say''  whether Mr. Assad's death would delay progress toward peace.</p>
        <p>''There will be a period of mourning in Syria,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''there will be a period of sorting out, and the Syrian people will make some decisions, and then we'll see what happens.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's view reflected the one that is prevalent among Middle East experts in his administration: that Mr. Assad's death changes the political landscape not only in Syria but also in the region in ways that will become apparent only over time.</p>
        <p>Even before Mr. Assad's death, the momentum for the Clinton administration to help close the gaps between Israel and Syria had been lost. That message came through loud and clear during President Clinton's failed meeting with Mr. Assad in Geneva in March, when the ailing Syrian leader lectured Mr. Clinton on the history of the border between Israel and Syria and demanded that Israel surrender not only the Golan Heights but also the northeastern shore and the northeastern portion of the Sea of Galilee that had been Syria's before the 1967 war.</p>
        <p>After the meeting, Mr. Clinton washed his hands of the matter, stating bluntly: ''The ball's in his court now.''</p>
        <p>But Syria's domestic politics and decision-making process is a blind spot for the United States. In addition, Syria has long been a frustrating negotiating partner and despite the official pronouncements is still considered a significant obstacle to a comprehensive Middle East peace arrangement.</p>
        <p>The succession will require time, the one thing Mr. Clinton doesn't have left. And there are other uncertainties, officials said: whether radical factions may use the transition to incite violence inside Syria or whether the combination of a change in the leadership in Syria combined with the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon last month could spark new violence.</p>
        <p>Still, administration officials said they believe that Mr. Assad's death gives the Syrian government an even greater incentive to preserve calm and stability on the Israeli-Lebanese border and to discourage attacks on Israel through proxies as a pressure tactic designed to extract concessions from Israel.</p>
        <p>Ms. Albright issued a statement today that Mr. Assad ''made a strategic choice for peace at Madrid in 1991,'' when Syria first agreed to talk directly with Israel. ''In all of our talks, he remained committed to that choice,'' she said. ''We strongly believe that was the right choice and expect that Syria will continue on the path to peace.''</p>
        <p>Other Clinton administration officials noted Mr. Assad autocratically ruled Syria for nearly 30 years and was unwilling or unable to take the steps necessary for peace; his son might take years to gain such strength. Even if Bashar Assad wanted to sit at the peace table with the Israelis, it is unclear they would trust a new and untried leader from the minority Alawite sect.</p>
        <p>A diplomat from the region in Washington said that the apparently seamless transition from Mr. Assad to his son suggests that the death was not unexpected or violent, but answers few other questions.</p>
        <p>''Assad was not loved, but he was a known quantity and very much in charge,'' he said. ''We all will be waiting to see if his son has full control. Assad was very much a one-man regime. Will all the forces who supported the father support the son? The current reality in the Middle East is based on assumptions that are no longer necessarily true.''</p>
