        <p>THE RASPUTIN FILE</p>
        <p>By Edvard Radzinsky.</p>
        <p>Translated by Judson Rosengrant.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 524 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $29.95.</p>
        <p>Grigory Rasputin, the power behind the throne of Czar Nicholas II, has once again become a magnet of attraction and repulsion in Russia. Under Boris Yeltsin, speculation arose that a modern-day Rasputin was pulling the strings from behind the scenes -- the financial tycoon and Kremlin insider Boris Berezovsky, perhaps, or the privatization chief, Anatoly Chubais. Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana Dyachenko, then, played the part of Czarina Alexandra to transmit these nefarious influences to the new autocrat. At the same time, Edvard Radzinsky writes, ''a new myth has emerged about the czar and the peasant Rasputin as the preservers of the immemorial Russian ideas of Orthodoxy and autocracy'' -- ideas now being appropriated by Yeltsin's successor, Vladimir Putin.</p>
        <p>This interest by itself would hardly justify another retelling of the familiar Rasputin story, nearly a century after his reign of occult influence on the Russian imperial family. But ''The Rasputin File'' has already attracted the attention of the news media, thanks to Radzinsky's reconstruction of Rasputin's assassination. The episode is an exciting climax to this account of the ''holy devil,'' as Radzinsky combines Sherlock Holmes and ''Rashomon'' to peel away the recollections of the various conspirators and reveal what actually happened in Prince Feliks Yusupov's Petrograd mansion on that December night in 1916. The reader will be fascinated by the answer.</p>
        <p>What makes ''The Rasputin File'' really fresh are the long-lost or suppressed documents that Radzinsky has managed to bring to light. The core of this material derives from the investigation of the Romanov court set in motion in 1917 by the Russian provisional government during the brief interval between the fall of the czar in March and the Bolshevik Revolution in November. The ''Extraordinary Commission of Inquiry for the Investigation of Illegal Acts by Ministers and Other Responsible Persons of the Czarist Regime'' interrogated all the leading figures of the old government, and 12 sections of proceedings (initially edited by the poet Aleksandr Blok) were eventually published by the Soviet authorities in 1926 and 1927 in seven hefty volumes (not ''seven little . . . pitiful volumes,'' as Radzinsky oddly describes them). However, a ''13th section'' of the inquiry, devoted to uncovering the ''dark forces'' behind the czar by interviewing the lesser lights around Rasputin and the court, was not revealed until 1964, when the chief investigator's summary report was finally published in a Soviet journal. Radzinsky got into the archives of the commission in the 1980's, but to his surprise he found the transcripts of the 13th section interrogations missing.</p>
        <p>Then, in 1995, the documents mysteriously turned up at a Sotheby's auction in London. They were bought, sight unseen, by the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who turned them over to Radzinsky. Sotheby's confirms the transaction, but cannot reveal the provenance of the material.</p>
        <p>Radzinsky is a Russian playwright and television personality, as well as the author of books on Nicholas II and Stalin, and he likes to seek out the sensational. The question naturally arises as to the authenticity, accuracy or completeness of the Sotheby's documents and of Radzinsky's use of them. He does not mention any plans to publish the whole file, and in the present work he only quotes extracts to advance his story. To be sure, where these excerpts occasionally overlap with the published interrogations, they track closely. Judson Rosengrant's translation from the Russian is fluent and fast-paced, and there is no reason to question its reliability.</p>
        <p>This work is a gripping tale of Rasputin's ascent to power, a story almost Tolstoyan in its complexities and ironies, as royal relatives and hangers-on enter and exit the stage. Sometimes the trees of intrigue overshadow the forest of a nation's fate, but the reader's concentration is fortunately aided by a prefatory guide to all the main characters and a genealogical table of the Romanovs. Radzinsky does not flinch from scandal about the marital breakups, the drunken orgies and the liaisons of all sorts that crisscrossed the Russian court. He wrings out a grim parallel between the murders of Rasputin and of Nicholas and Alexandra (shot in a basement, bodies burned).</p>
        <p>Radzinsky suggests that Rasputin was not as odious as posterity has been led to believe, that his religiosity was sincere even if perverse; but the weight of this account belies such charity. Graphically evoking the madness and corruption surrounding the Russian court, Radzinsky leaves little doubt that a revolution had to happen. After us the deluge -- Rasputin was only a lightning rod for the gathering clouds of doom, while the scramble for advantage still swirled around him: ''The czar . . . had ceded the disposition of power to the czarina, the czarina had entrusted it to the crafty peasant, and the peasant had entrusted it to crafty rascals. And the semifeudal country's crafty financiers bought the power from the rascals. . . . They all practiced to perfection the art of mutual extermination, although without realizing that it was rocking the common boat . . . which even so was just barely afloat.'' To which Radzinsky adds, disturbingly: ''As is clear today in Russia at the beginning of a new millennium. Only then it all ended in catastrophe.''</p>
