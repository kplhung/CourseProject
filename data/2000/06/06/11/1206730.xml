        <p>It is the most celebrated new arena in the National Basketball Association, a tribute to a time when players took set shots and wore canvas sneakers. It is part museum, part coliseum and a lot of magic for the Indiana Pacers.</p>
        <p>All season, the Pacers have been transformed at Conseco Fieldhouse, where they are a little bit faster, a little bit stronger and a little bit more accurate with their jumpers. They won 36 of 41 regular-season games at their retro home, including one over the Los Angeles Lakers, while going 20-21 on the road.</p>
        <p>Down by two games to none to the Lakers after rough Shaq-studded nights out West, the Pacers are looking at their home record as inspiration heading into Sunday night's Game 3 of the four-of-seven-game N.B.A. finals.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, we're 35-6 at home, so it makes a big difference,'' Indiana point guard Mark Jackson said, shortchanging the Pacers' home dominance by a game. ''We wasn't 35-6 on the road, so we're glad to be back here and we look forward to three games.''</p>
        <p>With the next three games scheduled for Conseco, the Pacers believe they have an excellent chance to make this series interesting before it heads back to Los Angeles, if necessary. No team has ever won the three straight home games in this 2-3-2 championship format, but the Pacers, who are making their first appearance in the finals, do not believe they are bound by precedent.</p>
        <p>''Ideally, we like having three games in a row on our home court, being down two to nothing,'' Jackson said. ''We're in good position if we take care of business. We're a veteran basketball team. We're a good basketball team, and we understand that all the Lakers did was take care of their business -- they won the two games at home. We have to come and take care of ours and put ourselves in a position to go back to L.A. and win this series.''</p>
        <p>The Pacers, who lost by 111-104 on Friday, have another reason to be optimistic. Kobe Bryant, who sprained his left ankle nine minutes into Game 2 and did not return, is questionable for Sunday. While it was meant somewhat as a joke, Pacers officials had to find the sight of Shaquille O'Neal carrying Bryant off the team bus and into Conseco for today's practice encouraging.</p>
        <p>''They didn't have a cart or nothing like that,'' said Bryant, who rode on O'Neal's back. ''And he didn't want me walking in here without any crutches. So I hopped on his back and got a little piggyback ride.''</p>
        <p>So far, O'Neal has carried the Lakers much like he did Bryant this afternoon. Averaging 41.5 points and 21.5 rebounds over the first two games, O'Neal is well on his way toward making history against Indiana. So concerned are the Pacers about O'Neal's dominance that Jalen Rose, whose job would seem to get considerably easier if Bryant is sidelined, said Bryant's presence or absence was largely inconsequential.</p>
        <p>''As long as Shaq is playing it don't matter,'' Rose said. ''I'm not saying that he's unstoppable. He can be stopped. He's shown that he can be stopped. If he's a human and he's a mere mortal, he can be stopped. But we just have to go out there and do it.''</p>
        <p>The Pacers have tried nearly everything short of sending all five players at O'Neal after he catches the ball. They have abandoned their abhorrence of the double-team, charging one and two players at O'Neal, but to no avail. And in the final minutes on Friday, they went to the desperate fouling of O'Neal.</p>
        <p>Lakers Coach Phil Jackson, always one to play psychological games with an opponent, took a veiled shot at the Pacers' maneuver. ''It's part of a philosophy, although profiting by fouling is supposed to be against the grain of the game, so to speak,'' Jackson said today. ''When Dr. James Naismith invented the game, if you fouled you had to leave the game. You had to go sit out for a while, and I still think that's a pretty good idea.''</p>
        <p>Almost conceding monumental outings by O'Neal, some of the Pacers said they could win with him scoring 40. But to do so, they must limit his supporting cast, especially Glen Rice and the suddenly spry Ron Harper. And on the other end, the Pacers have to display some touch.</p>
        <p>The league's best shooting team during the regular season, the Pacers have hit 39.6 percent of their shots against the Lakers. Indiana shot a league-high 39.2 percent from 3-point range during the season but has made a paltry 10 of 34 3-pointers (29.4 percent) in this series.</p>
        <p>One reason the Pacers failed to capitalize on Bryant's absence -- a happenstance that Reggie Miller termed ''a golden opportunity'' -- was their 37.5 percent shooting.</p>
        <p>''Although we have had struggles in the first two games, we did some things pretty well,'' the reserve forward Austin Croshere said. ''We just missed shots. Our field goal percentage was terrible for the first two games. And if we can come in with a little more familiarity at home, I think we'll shoot the ball better.''</p>
