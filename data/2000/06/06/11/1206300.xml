        <p>AIRLINE  Antiques Aloft</p>
        <p>It's called ''Antiques Roadshow,'' but starting this month, it has become an air show, too, as Delta Air Lines has begun showing tapes of the PBS show in flight. The popular weekly show features antiques dealers and auction-house experts from around the country giving free appraisals of various treasures, heirlooms and trash that people bring them. The show is patterned after a British series, episodes of which are shown on Delta's international flights. No appraisals aboard Delta flights, though.</p>

        <p>EXHIBITION  'Peanuts' and Cracker Jack</p>
        <p>Charlie Brown may well have been the least successful pitcher of all time, but that hasn't prevented the star of the ''Peanuts'' comic strip from getting into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y. Through the end of the year, ''You're in the Hall of Fame, Charlie Brown'' includes eight original strips by Charles M. Schulz and reproductions of more than 100 others, all with baseball as the subject. Peanuts memorabilia and collectibles are also part of the exhibit. Tickets are $9.50, age 65 or older $8, and ages 7 to 12 $4. Call (888) 425-5633.</p>
        <p>HOTEL  Pokemon, the Giveaway</p>
        <p>To appease kids who cannot wait until the new ''Pokemon the Movie 2000'' comes out, Comfort Inns and Comfort Suites are offering a free 52-page activity book for young guests. The booklets will be available starting Thursday until Aug. 31 at 1,500 hotels nationwide. Activities include crosswords, mazes and picture puzzles. The movie will be released July 21.</p>
