        <p>Oh, by the way, the Devils won the Stanley Cup tonight. If you went to bed before it ended, you might have been awakened by the sound waves of celebration reverberating from Texas to the Jersey Shore before they splashed across the National Hockey League.</p>
        <p>Overlooked by many fans and news media in their own metropolitan area, respected but rarely revered even in their own profession, the New Jersey players won the trophy with a 2-1 victory in double overtime over the Dallas Stars in Reunion Arena to clinch the championship series by four games to two.</p>
        <p>Jason Arnott scored the game-winner at 8 minutes 21 seconds of the fifth period by beating Ed Belfour with a wrist shot after taking a back-handed pass across the slot from Patrik Elias.</p>
        <p>It ended another brilliant goaltending duel between Martin Brodeur of the Devils, who stopped 30 of 31 shots and Belfour of the Stars, who stopped 43 of 45. Also assisting on the goal was Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain and defenseman, who won the Conn Smythe trophy as the most valuable player in the tournament.</p>
        <p>''This is unbelievable,'' Stevens said. ''It's a dream come true for our team.''</p>
        <p>In all, the two teams played five overtime periods in Games 5 and 6 in what turned out to be one long, almost uninterrupted, battle of wills. Dallas won Game 5, 1-0, in triple overtime; this time, New Jersey prevailed, sparing these two exhausted teams from having to summon the strength to play Game 7 on Monday night.</p>
        <p>After the game, Devils Coach Larry Robinson said, ''We didn't set the world on fire the last few weeks of the season, but we glued together as the playoffs progressed and the guys believed in themselves.''</p>
        <p>The game was marred by an injury to Petr Sykora of the Devils, who left the ice on a stretcher after being checked to the ice by Dallas defenseman Derian Hatcher in the first period.</p>
        <p>Sykora was held overnight in a hospital for observation. In the celebration on the ice, Elias and his teammates took turns wrapping themselves in Sykora's No. 17 jersey while they skated around the ice.</p>
        <p>In the third period and the first overtime, the game built with excruciating tension, much like Thursday's overtime battle.</p>
        <p>Many of the fans in the jammed arena remained on their feet and the air was filled with shrieks and gasps as both teams got great scoring chances and great goaltending.</p>
        <p>In the third period, the Stars had a 13-7 shooting edge, rare for them in any period in this series. At the 18:43 mark of the first overtime, Arnott was penalized for cross-checking Blake Sloan while they grappled on the ice. As the clock passed midnight in the East, the Stars, with a series of patient passes, proceeded to work the puck to Brett Hull, for an open shot. But the puck thudded off the boards behind Brodeur as the fans groaned. Shortly after, the first overtime ended.</p>
        <p>As the fourth intermission began, and the game entered its fifth hour, the Stars still had 42 seconds left on its power play, but again they didn't score.</p>
        <p>The Devils' victory was the first for an Eastern Conference team since the Devils swept Detroit in 1995. With two tournament championships to go with three Eastern Conference titles in the regular season, the Devils can claim to be one of the most successful hockey franchises of this era. It is also an unusual team in terms of its fan support and visibility.</p>
        <p>Despite being one of the best teams in the N.H.L. all season, the Devils sold out only 2 of 41 home games. Some tickets were unsold for some of their playoff games. Although the team is less than 10 miles from the league's New York headquarters and the news media capital of the world, most of the championship round drew modest interest in the mainstream sports world.</p>
        <p>Television ratings were down until Thursday night, when Mike Modano's goal gave Dallas the victory in triple overtime. None of this mattered in the here and now of the postgame festivities.</p>
        <p>The title ended a tournament that lasted almost two months and ended an era for the franchise. Before meeting and beating the defending champion Stars, the Devils eliminated Florida in four games, Toronto in six and Philadelphia in seven.</p>
        <p>Their new era begins almost immediately as John McMullen, who bought the team and moved it from Colorado in 1982, will turn over control to new ownership, the YankeeNets combine, this summer.</p>
        <p>In tonight's game, the first period saw two serious injuries and the second period saw two goals. The third began with tension and an edge of malice. Play was rugged and the two referees allowed much contact without penalty.</p>
        <p>The first injury was to Darryl Sydor, the Dallas defenseman, who hurt his leg and left the game when he fell awkwardly after trying to check Scott Gomez. While play continued, Sydor crawled from the boards toward the Dallas net, forcing the officials to stop play.</p>
        <p>The second injury, with 7:52 remaining in the period, came when Hatcher, the big Dallas captain, checked Sykora, whose 17 points were third best on the Devils in this tournament. The collision left Sykora flat on his back for at least five minutes and he was taken out of the arena on a stretcher.</p>
        <p>Video replays were inconclusive as to the point of impact or the type of injury. As Sykora came across the blue line, Hatcher moved across the zone laterally and made contact with either his shoulder, his elbow or his forearm or some combination of the three. Officials immediately signaled for medical attention. No penalty was called.</p>
        <p>The check was similar to the one by Devils captain Scott Stevens against Philadelphia's Eric Lindros in the final game of the previous series. That hit left Lindros with the sixth concussion of his career.</p>
        <p>The Devils scored at 5:18 of the second period, a short-handed goal by Scott Niedermayer, who beat Ed Belfour with a wrist shot from short range after a three-on-one rush ignited at the other end by the checking of Claude Lemieux. The Stars got it back 69 seconds later when Mike Keane finished a play by beating Martin Brodeur with a high wrist shot. The play was created by Modano's rush up the left-wing boards.</p>
        <p>The Devils seemed to have fresher legs than the Stars and led in shots by 24-16. They hit two goal posts in the second period, the first by John Madden, the second, a cross bar, by Elias. But the Stars were opportunistic, picking their spots. Hull tested Brodeur and so did Modano. Late in the period, as play grew vicious, the referees, Terry Gregson and Bill McCreary, began to send players off in pairs. The two captains, Stevens and Hatcher, went off for roughing.</p>
        <p>On went the game, into a third period, and then two overtimes. And then finally, an exhausted New Jersey could hoist the cup over its head.</p>
