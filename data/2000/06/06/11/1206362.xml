        <p>NOTHING brightens up a driver's day like somebody else's road rage. We don't see enough of it here on Long Island. Traffic moves at such a stately pace that angry drivers must either just calm down or suffer an apoplectic fit, right under the sign that says ''Long Delays Ahead.''</p>
        <p>But it is stimulating, from time to time, to observe a driver who has totally lost his cool and goes roaring down the expressway median, or the sidewalk, screaming and waving his fist and foaming at the mouth. It makes the rest of us feel so mature.</p>

        <p>NOTHING brightens up a driver's day like somebody else's road rage. We don't see enough of it here on Long Island. Traffic moves at such a stately pace that angry drivers must either just calm down or suffer an apoplectic fit, right under the sign that says ''Long Delays Ahead.''</p>
        <p>But it is stimulating, from time to time, to observe a driver who has totally lost his cool and goes roaring down the expressway median, or the sidewalk, screaming and waving his fist and foaming at the mouth. It makes the rest of us feel so mature.</p>
        <p>No doubt in a year or two, we shall see a government-financed Road Rage Research Institute in Washington, endowed chairs in road rage at major universities, the first Ph.D. in road rage, road rage therapies, road rage pills, bumper stickers, T-shirts and advice books. The road rage television specials and movies are already in the works.</p>
        <p>A whole industry is growing up around road rage and its associated syndromes like Supermarket Parking Lot Rage (the battle for the parking slot closest to the entrance) and the very dangerous condition called Garage Sale Rage. This last is at its worst on summer weekends, when the victim gets stuck behind a very wide, very slow automobile occupied by an elderly couple, who stop for five minutes at every intersection while they study tiny cardboard signs stapled to the nearest utility pole. Garage Sale Rage is aggravated by sudden stops and suicidal U-turns, and has been known to lead to outbreaks of verbal violence in the subdivisions.</p>
        <p>Road rage has been identified as a social problem requiring a legal solution: Road rage must be made a punishable offense. This opens up an exciting vista for legislation. We are positively awash with undesirable emotions that are uncomfortable and even offensive to our fellow citizens: lust, greed, prejudice and ambition, to name only four. If all such feelings were made felonies, the world would quickly become a kinder, gentler place.</p>
        <p>The truth is, of course, that politicians might as well legislate against bad weather. Road rage is as American as apple pie, and no more likely to disappear. Now it has become a pathology, and we have to search for a cure.</p>
        <p>One answer is defensive driving. In its simplest and most direct form, defensive driving means simply buying a very large S.U.V. -- or better still, a full-size truck or a military surplus armored vehicle with weapons still attached -- and daring anyone to argue.</p>
        <p>If you don't believe that the best form of defense is attack, you can enroll in one of the many state-sponsored defensive-driving courses organized by safety councils in churches, colleges and community centers around the Island.</p>
        <p>One attraction of these courses is that you get a 10 percent reduction in your insurance premium. If you have so many points on your licence that you are in imminent danger of going by bus, a defensive-driving course will earn you a reduction of up to four  points.</p>
        <p>By some miracle, I don't yet have any points on my licence. But I thought it might be a good idea to take a course, or perhaps several of them, to build up credit points against future episodes of vehicular mayhem.</p>
        <p>So I consulted Bob Owens, of Safety Education in St. James, who teaches defensive driving all over the Island. He quickly disillusioned me: there is no credit system. But he was a font of information about survival techniques for Long Island drivers.</p>
        <p>The main thing is to avoid driving while intoxicated. The participants in a defensive-driving course are exposed to the full horror of drunken driving, including a film illustrating the effects of alcohol on coordination (not good), and the traumatic arrest process (even worse).</p>
        <p>Students learn the intimidating language of legal penalties -- revocation, suspension, incarceration, deportation -- until they are almost too scared to drive home. They are taught not to follow other vehicles too closely (though nobody has yet discovered how to leave more than one car's length ahead without another car sliding into it). They are reminded about the uses of seat belts and air bags, mirrors, the dreaded blind spot in which whole 16-wheelers can hide, and how important it is to wear their own glasses rather than the first ones they picked up that morning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Owens defined road rage as: ''When aggressive driving comes up to the level of assault.'' This is what must be avoided at all costs. Drivers should not upset other drivers with rude gestures, or by creating gridlock, or using automatic weapons, or driving on the wrong side of the road, or displaying bumber stickers with messages like ''Don't like my driving? Dial 1-800- . . .'' But this is a family newspaper.</p>
        <p>I am much calmer after having talked to Mr. Owens about defensive driving. In fact, I no longer feel the need to watch old tapes of ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' before getting on the road in the mornings. I ease the big S.U.V. out of the driveway, visualize positively, gun the motor just a little and relax into my defensive mode. Just stay out of my way and nothing bad will happen.</p>
