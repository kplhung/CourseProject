        <p>TWO old men chatting on a street outside the Larchmont Post Office could occupy the same turf in Garden City. The sweet aroma of cafe con leche drifting out of a Mexican restaurant in Port Chester could be coming through the entrance of a Salvadoran eatery in Hempstead. A diner in Hastings-on-Hudson could be a diner in Oyster Bay, the same hungry eaters with their sport utility vehicles nosed to the curbs outside.</p>
        <p>The weekend tag sales that proliferate each spring could be in Levittown or Tarrytown, Roslyn or Rye, any of the scores of bedroom communities that make up Nassau and Westchester Counties.</p>
        <p>To casual observers, the two counties are nearly indistinguishable. Westchester is larger in land area, Nassau larger in population. Westchester was recently ranked the seventh wealthiest county in America; Nassau placed 17th. They share Long Island Sound and a state government. Both have fabulous mansions and pockets of poverty, Lyme ticks and West Nile mosquitoes and a border with New York City.</p>
        <p>Yet one glaring difference sets them apart. While Westchester's government is the picture of economic health, awash in a sea of surplus and with a credit rating that is among the best in the country, Nassau is in a budget crisis that will probably require every New York State taxpayer's help, and with a deficit that has pushed its bond rating nearly to junk status.</p>
        <p>How such similar counties evolved financially -- ''like night and day'' in the words of an aide to the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall -- is a tale of philosophically opposite methods of budgeting and taxing set against wildly varying political landscapes.</p>
        <p>In Nassau, one-party politics prompted Republican leaders into disastrous financial decisions. For years, county officials forged a steady record of underestimating costs and overestimating revenues. They held the line on property taxes but paid employees handsomely, while selling off county property or borrowing mountains of cash to keep government chugging along.</p>
        <p>But their luck ran out last year as the deficit reached $300 million. An apathetic electorate was energized, humbling a legendary G.O.P. machine and creating a Democratic legislative majority for the first time in nearly a century. At the heart of the election was the budget mess.</p>
        <p>In Westchester, more conservative budgeting grew out of years of competition between Democratic and Republican elected officials, who held one another in check.  Westchester voters saw their legislative branch overhauled 26 years ahead of Nassau's, a move that gave lawmakers more responsibility and provided needed checks and balances in government, officials on both sides agree.</p>
        <p>Westchester leaders never got into Nassau's habit of using one-time revenues, like money from the sale of a hospital, for example, to pay continuing costs. They did little borrowing. And, unpopular as it was, they increased property taxes a bit each year to cover spending increases.</p>
        <p>''The problems in Nassau have been a reflection of politics and history,'' said Bruce Nyman, a former Democratic member of the Nassau County Legislature, which replaced the old Board of Supervisors in 1996. ''One-party government controlled a part-time legislature that was able to rubber-stamp the executive branch of government. When you put the politics and history together, it was a recipe for disaster.''</p>
        <p>A comparison of the counties found the following:</p>
        <p>*In Nassau, each resident's share of the county's debt is $2,065. That is more than twice as much as any other county in New York and more than six times the state average. By contrast, Westchester's debt is $627 per resident.</p>
        <p>*Nassau spends $520 million -- nearly a quarter of its $2.2 billion budget -- on a police department whose rank-and-file officers are paid $90,000 a year. Officers eat up half the county payroll but comprise just 29 percent of the work force. Westchester has a much smaller police force, representing a mere 1.8 percent of the county's $1.17 billion budget. The average officer is paid $63,500 a year.</p>
        <p>*When Nassau sold its hospital last year for $82 million, it used the windfall to help plug the deficit. When Westchester transferred its hospital to a public benefit corporation in 1997, it did it for $1, not seeking to make money off the deal. Similarly, Nassau used $170 million in tobacco settlement money to pay for ongoing costs and to help balance its books. Westchester used $63.4 million of its tobacco money to erase hospital debts through 2005.</p>
        <p>*The biggest share of Nassau's debt -- $100 million a year -- goes to repay homeowners and merchants who successfully challenge their property tax assessments. Westchester paid $9 million in such refunds last year. And unlike Nassau, which borrows to pay, Westchester pays with money budgeted for that purpose.</p>
        <p>*In Nassau, property taxes are collected by towns and cities, which first take their share and forward the remainder to the county. If there is a shortfall, it's the county's responsibility to collect. In Westchester, the towns and cities collect the money and pay the county first.</p>
        <p>Taken together, the effect of such procedural differences is staggering, experts say. Today, Westchester has the highest credit rating given by Standard &amp; Poor's, while Nassau's rating is hovering just above junk status, with a downgrade threatened for month's end.</p>
        <p>''I would say that if Nassau had used Westchester as an example of how to run a county over the past 10 years, Nassau's taxpayers would be in much better shape today,'' Comptroller McCall said.</p>
        <p>But the tale of the two counties is also a story of residents whose lives are playing out differently. While Westchester's roughly 900,000 residents are gliding along on one of the nation's longest economic expansions, there's a recession mentality among Nassau's 1.3 million people, who are nagged by a daily sense of fiscal chaos, by the prospect of tax increases and layoffs of county police officers and by cutbacks in services that are punctuated by protest marches through the county seat in Garden City.</p>
        <p>Still, both counties have hordes of retail stores filled with shoppers with ready cash. Both have high per-capita income and low unemployment.</p>
        <p>''The fact that Westchester didn't have Nassau's problems doesn't mean it's more affluent than Nassau,'' said Anthony A. Cupaiuolo, a professor of public administration at Pace University in White Plains. ''It was just managed better than Nassau and didn't get involved in all the political games.''</p>
        <p>In Nassau, the problem comes down to one simple truth: there is not enough money flowing in to cover the amount streaming out, as County Comptroller Frederick E. Parola, a Republican, has been saying since June 1996.</p>
        <p>In Westchester, because the math adds up, deficits are unheard of and the cost of governing is balanced, said Kathleen M. Carrano, Westchester's budget director, who grew up in Nassau County and once worked as the controller in Glen Cove.</p>
        <p>Nassau's fiscal tailspin started long before its deficit hit $300 million last summer. The county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, took office in 1987. While he oversaw spending increases for things like keeping the county parks pristine and ensuring that salaries for county employees outpaced inflation, he held the line on property taxes. Feeling no pain, the voters for years rewarded him at the polls.</p>
        <p>In Westchester, tax increases came in frequent small steps. It was enough so that County Executive Andrew J. Spano, a Democrat, could cut taxes by 3 percent this year.</p>
        <p>''I think the reluctance to raise property taxes incrementally is a major cause of where Nassau stands fiscally today,'' said Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, Long Island's largest business group.</p>
        <p>One beneficiary of Nassau's lavish spending has been the county police department, where costs have shot up 64 percent in the past decade, and where lucrative provisions in a series of police contracts -- one negotiated, in 1992, and the most recent one decided by an arbitrator -- have seen payouts for retiring officers reach the six-figure mark, with the average supervisor taking home $207,000 upon retirement last year.</p>
        <p>Westchester's spending on its police force is much lower, just $19.6 million.</p>
        <p>The Westchester Department of Public Safety was created by voter referendum in the early 1980's, and it merged a former Sheriff's Department with what used to be called the office of Parkway Police. Today, there are 273 positions budgeted for the department, including 222 uniformed officers. That compares with 4,100 positions, including 3,100 officers, in Nassau.</p>
        <p>To Todd A. Whitestone, managing director of public finance ratings at Standard &amp; Poor's, it is not the cost of such things as police services that is alarming in Nassau as much as it is Nassau's inability to pay.</p>
        <p>Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader of the County Legislature, said Nassau must rethink what it can afford.</p>
        <p>''Nassau has always had the Cadillac of programs, and everyone else has had Chevys and Fords, and we have to get to that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Now, he added, politicians in Nassau need the political will to cut costs.</p>
        <p>Of course, cutting jobs or salaries in Nassau has always been politically unpalatable because appointed commissioners, deputy commissioners, secretaries and others have been the lifeblood of a strong Republican machine.</p>
        <p>Democrats in Nassau, hampered by internal squabbling for more than a decade, were often left on the sidelines by an electorate that ''tolerated wasteful spending and governmental mismanagement,'' said Neal Lewis, executive director of the Long Island Neighborhood Network, an advocacy group.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cupaiuolo, of Pace, said: ''In Westchester, for quite a few years, both parties held active roles. Both parties have been healthier, and that is healthier when you have two parties that are competitive. The impression I get is that Nassau is just riddled with patronage, and outrageously so, and the political culture was, 'Let's keep bringing people on, giving them good salaries and this way we can stay in office as long as we want.' It certainly exists in Westchester, but I don't believe to that extent.''</p>
        <p>Nassau's problems are aggravated by its debt.</p>
        <p>In addition to loans for roads and buildings, Nassau borrows just to keep government going. To cover operating costs, Nassau's projected cash flow borrowing this year is $485 million, compared with $75 million for that purpose last year in Westchester, municipal analysts said. Westchester has scheduled no short-term borrowing in 2000.</p>
        <p>''That is a big difference with Westchester's triple A and Nassau's triple B,'' Diane P. Brosen, director at Standard &amp; Poor's, said of the credit ratings. ''One big warning sign of fiscal problems is an escalation of debt and cash-flow borrowing.''</p>
        <p>Overall, Westchester has been closer to the mark in estimating cash flow, for items like sales tax receipts, and its expenses, for things like employee overtime. Only once in recent history, in 1998, has Westchester overestimated its sales tax revenue, Ms. Carrano said.</p>
        <p>Nassau, on the other hand, has consistently underestimated overtime costs and, at least since 1995, it has overestimated sales tax receipts. Last year, receipts were $9 million short, and the year before they were $33 million short, according to Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
        <p>When shortfalls or apparent overruns do occur, Nassau is slow to pick up on them and make budget adjustments at midyear or at quarterly marks in the fiscal year, Ms. Brosen said. ''They just wait and say, 'Whoop, you know, there is a big gap here,' '' she said. But in Westchester, there is ''ongoing budget monitoring, both expenditures and revenues,'' said Robin Prunty, the Standard &amp; Poors analyst who monitors Westchester.</p>
        <p>Michael P. Jacobson, a former budget official in New York City who helped the  Nassau Legislature prepare a fiscal plan last fall, said he was left feeling that Nassau's financial management system was completely nonexistent. A key problem, he said, was that Nassau's budget office was understaffed, though adding people was a ''heavy lift politically, if you are in financial straits.''</p>
        <p>He continued: ''There was not a centralized, powerful budget office that was able to know immediately, on a real-time basis, early on, what problems were coming down the pike, what to do about them, how to avert problems; there was absolutely no multiyear budgeting. My sense is Westchester probably has a better management system. They keep closer track.''</p>
        <p>Stopping the kind of actions that lead to budget problems in Nassau will take political will, most financial experts agree. It is an ingredient many say was missing in Nassau for years, especially considering that budgets must be passed a few days before Election Day, making tax increases that much more difficult, politically.</p>
        <p>Arthur J. Kremer, a former Democratic state assemblyman who is now a lawyer at Rivkin Radler &amp; Kremer, one of Long Island's largest law firms, said that in Nassau ''the government was sound asleep and failed to follow any of the warning signs'' of a fiscal wreck coming down the road.</p>
        <p>But unlike New York City in 1975, or Troy, which nearly went bankrupt in 1994, or Orange County, Calif., which lost $2 billion in a risky investment scheme, Nassau threatens to crumble in the midst of a soaring national economy. To Edward Glaeser, professor of economics at Harvard University, the case for a state government bailout of Nassau is hard to make, even though the first steps are in place with a plan by Gov. George E. Pataki to combine $100 million in grants to Nassau with a fiscal control board that would monitor Nassau's efforts to get its act together, and impose its own plan if it cannot.</p>
        <p>''This is not a city like Detroit that is mired in poverty; it is a healthy place that, if it were run with any sense of fiscal responsibility, should be very healthy,'' Mr. Glaeser said of Nassau. But, he said, the comparison to Westchester is even more startling, given the two counties' many similarities. ''In one area, fiscal responsibility reigns, and in the other place they are playing games.''</p>
        <p>The Difference a Legislature Makes</p>
        <p>IF you ask Arthur J. Kremer the No. 1 reason why ''the structure crumbled'' in Nassau County, the former state assemblyman will tell you it is because Nassau did not have a legislature until four years ago.</p>
        <p>In Westchester County, those who know the system said, the creation of such a body in 1970 is a big reason why government is now in good financial shape.</p>
        <p>''No doubt, the closer you get to one person one vote, the more effective you can govern,'' said Stephen P. Tenore, a Republican lawmaker for 11 years in Westchester and the former chairman of the county's Board of Legislators.</p>
        <p>Under Nassau's old Board of Supervisors system, one representative each came from the cities of Long Beach and Glen Cove and from the towns of Oyster Bay and North Hempstead. Two more came from the more populous town of Hempstead.</p>
        <p>''The board was made up of town supervisors who really didn't care much about county government except to make sure they got their share of the pie,'' said Mr. Kremer, a Democrat, who said that even when the new 19-member Legislature took over in 1996, it ''needed two to three years to find out what was going on, and they were in no position to find out the depth of the problems until recently.''</p>
        <p>Westchester abandoned its Board of Supervisors for a legislature 26 years earlier than Nassau because its board wasn't working well. The legislature ''never let the budget go out of shape'' over the years, said Herman D. Geist, a Republican and the legislature's first chairman.</p>
        <p>While a strong legislative body in Westchester kept a check on the executive branch, Nassau suffered ''from a lack of a strong county government in terms of planning, environmental protection, industrial development,'' said Bruce Nyman, a former Democratic member of Nassau's Board of Supervisors and Legislature.</p>
        <p>David Liebschutz, an adjunct professor at Rockefeller College of SUNY Albany, said that even now politics has kept an inexperienced legislature in Nassau from forming a consensus with the executive branch on how to pull the county out of its mess. The alternative may yet be a fiscal oversight board to shoulder the tough decisions -- and share in any potential political blame.</p>
