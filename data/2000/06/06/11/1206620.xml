        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article ''Our Trip's Long Enough as It Is, Commuters Tell M.T.A.'' (May 28), regarding plans to modify Bronx train service, did not treat the argument from the point of view of all commuters.</p>
        <p>The No. 5 train runs on two lines during rush hours, Dyre Avenue and White Plains Road, and both run express between 180th Street and 149th Street. However, No. 2 (White Plains Road) trains have always run local at these times, giving West Side commuters a longer, less reliable commute.</p>

        <p>Your article ''Our Trip's Long Enough as It Is, Commuters Tell M.T.A.'' (May 28), regarding plans to modify Bronx train service, did not treat the argument from the point of view of all commuters.</p>
        <p>The No. 5 train runs on two lines during rush hours, Dyre Avenue and White Plains Road, and both run express between 180th Street and 149th Street. However, No. 2 (White Plains Road) trains have always run local at these times, giving West Side commuters a longer, less reliable commute.</p>
        <p>As a regular No. 2 commuter, I was thrilled to hear that the M.T.A. had finally planned to divide rush-hour express service equitably between the No. 2 and No. 5 lines. It is with shock and dismay that I and all other No. 2 riders learn that this plan has been delayed. The route on the No. 2 line is much longer than that on the No. 5 Dyre Ave. line, so it would seem appropriate that the No. 2 line deserves express service as planned.</p>
