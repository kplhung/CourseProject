      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>With her signature spiky haircut and fiddle at the ready, the performance artist Laurie Anderson has been a darling of the downtown art scene for three decades. The art critic RoseLee Goldberg has written a thoughtful, if at times too adulatory, overview of Anderson's multimedia career. This handsomely produced LAURIE ANDERSON (Abrams, $39.95) covers her early sculptures and sketches, art-rock records like her pop hit ''O Superman,'' quirky inventions and grandly scaled electronic operas like ''Home of the Brave'' and her latest, ''Songs and Stories From Moby-Dick.'' Anderson trained as a classical violinist with the Chicago Youth Symphony, studied art at Columbia University and actually did walk away from an airplane crash, as recounted in her song ''The Language of the Future.'' Her experimental work has been influenced by the Fluxus performance artists, as well as by John Cage, Philip Glass and William S. Burroughs, but Goldberg presumptuously links her to Whitman, Melville and the prophet Isaiah. Although Goldberg assumes the reader is familiar with performance art, her descriptions of Anderson's pieces are vivid and illuminating, and she shows the seamless continuity of Anderson's daily life, dreams and work.</p>
