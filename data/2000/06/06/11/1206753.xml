        <p>The Metro-North Railroad is adding 18 weekday trains, more service in the Bronx and two new stations, Wassaic and Tenmile River, beginning July 9. On the Hudson line, two new morning departures from Tarrytown, at 6:54 a.m. and 7:12 a.m., have been scheduled. In Cortlandt, the 7:46 a.m. express from the Croton-Harmon train station will originate at Cortlandt at 7:37 a.m. And to meet rider requests for more express service to and from Irvington, Ardsley, Dobbs Ferry and Hastings-on-Hudson, new peak time expresses are being introduced. On the New Haven line, there is new, off-peak weekday inbound service from Harrison and a summer Friday-only express to New Haven.</p>
