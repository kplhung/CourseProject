        <p>''IT was not an instantaneous decision,'' said Sarah Stranahan, the chairwoman of her family foundation, the Needmor Fund, about its choice to invest its $32 million endowment with an eye to community organizing.</p>
        <p>Started in Toledo, Ohio, in 1956 by descendants of the founder of the Champion Spark Plug Company, the foundation has given money to a wide array of causes, including the Arkansas Institute for Social Justice, the Farm Labor Research Project and the Minnesota Alliance for Progressive Action.</p>
        <p>And over the last 15 years, the Needmor Fund, now based in Boulder, Colo., has gone from dabbling in socially responsible investing -- screening its portfolio for stocks in companies whose actions conflict with its mission, or using its shareholdings to push for change -- to committing its entire endowment to the philosophy.</p>
        <p>''It began with a very emotional issue that was very close to home,''  Ms. Stranahan recalled. In 1985, the fund's board began discussing its significant holdings in Champion, which faced a shareholder resolution concerning its operations in South Africa. The debate over how the fund should vote its shares, she said, awakened the board to the possibility that it had other holdings where voting proxies or taking other action might be consistent with its mission.</p>
        <p>The question, Ms. Stranahan said, was: ''If we really wanted to be responsible in investments, why single out one stock?''</p>
        <p>By 1987, there was heated discussion over whether to engage in issue-minded investing. The next year, the directors invited Amy L. Domini, one of the best-known proponents of that approach, to speak with them. In 1989, Needmor decided to invest part of its portfolio with Franklin Research and Development, the oldest investment firm dedicated to socially-screened investing. (Franklin changed its name last year to Trillium Asset Management, but keeps the same focus. Needmor has since switched to other managers.)</p>
        <p>From the outset, board members were very concerned that the foundation -- representing the charitable efforts of three generations of family members -- would have to sacrifice investment returns, according to Ms. Stranahan. ''The feeling was always that if we do this, we'll lose a lot of money,'' she said. The reality, she said, is that the fund's investment managers have generally outperformed the stock market.</p>
        <p>In trying to invest with its social goals in mind, Needmor also made the discovery that one of its traditional managers, Neuberger &amp; Berman, was only too eager to invest under social guidelines.</p>
        <p>But it took years before the board decided to increase its commitment.  ''There was an evolution that was respectful of old relationships,'' Ms. Stranahan explained. By 1993, the board decided that, as it diversified its portfolio, any new money managers would have to use social screens.  Finally, last year, the fund shifted its entire portfolio to that approach.</p>
        <p>While Needmor was active in lobbying the Intel Corporation in 1995 to work more closely with environmentalists, the fund is carefully considering what, if any, future shareholder actions it might attempt or how else to use its endowment to further its goals.</p>
        <p>''We can't be on the right side of every shareholder resolution,'' Ms. Stranahan acknowledged. ''That would be exhausting.'' The board has asked Stephen Viederman, the former president of the Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation and an outspoken advocate of socially responsible investing, to advise its finance committee on possibilities.</p>
        <p>''None of these decisions came easily for the board,'' Ms. Stranahan said. But she is convinced that her family's foundation made the right choice. ''When you run into a clash between two objectives,'' she said, ''it's your job to solve it.''</p>
