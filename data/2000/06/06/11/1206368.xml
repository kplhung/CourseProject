        <p>The voluptuous 1997 Wolffer merlot is bottled pornography. If it went to confession, the parish would need a backup, and have to pay both men time and a half.</p>
        <p>Its bouquet is so seductively full of jammy, sweet promise that a man in midlife crisis might leave his wife for this wine. Don't be surprised if Howard Stern interviews the bottle. And if you take X-rating seriously, don't serve it around children.</p>
        <p>It's the kind of California-style merlot (Beverly Hills, not Napa) that the wine critic Robert B. Parker Jr., who is famously bewitched by luscious confectionery aromas and flavors, would award 102 on a scale of 100.</p>
        <p>In a technical analysis, Roman Roth, the winemaker and general manager at the Wolffer Estate (Sagpond Vineyards), says the $30 wine, made from estate-grown grapes, is ''unfiltered and unfined'' -- meaning he left it alone. He might have left it undressed.</p>
        <p>Not only are the fruity flavor and finish boundless, the texture is velvety and unctuous. Only 230 cases are left. To protect public morals, the winery, at Sagaponack on the South Fork, should impose a one-bottle limit per customer.</p>
        <p>Actually, in also releasing a $14 merlot on a second label, La Ferme Martin, for everyday use, the Wolffer Estate has shown a balancing, conservative streak. (The label translates as ''Martin's Farm''; the owner, Christian Wolffer, named it for his father.)</p>
        <p>Unlike the '97 companion, a slurper that you take out to Saturday dinner, the '98 La Ferme Martin is a sipper that you bring home for a Monday steak dinner.</p>
        <p>It, too, is grapey, but was made largely from purchased North Fork grapes,as against home-grown ones, a significant quality-control difference; it is woodier than its companion, and it has an outsize herbal character, a flaw. Yet, though prim at first, after an hour's aeration it begins to let its hair down.</p>
        <p>I better call the police.</p>
