        <p>STELIOS HAJI-IOANNOU is the first to admit that he likes the finer things in life. ''My ideal hangout would be a gentleman's club,'' he said, laughing, during a $70 breakfast for two here at the One Aldwych Hotel, where he stays when he is not home in his Monaco penthouse. ''I'm not the typical person like my customers. I come from a wealthy family.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Haji-Ioannou (pronounced HA-ji-oh-AHN-oo) is very rich. But he also happens to be the founder of the EasyGroup, a feisty London company that has spawned a bevy of brands here  representing all things on the cheap.</p>
        <p>There is EasyJet, his first creation, which in Europe mimics Southwest Airlines, the rollicking  low-cost carrier in the United States. Then there is EasyEverything, a chain of huge Internet cafes, most in Britain but spreading across Europe, that each boast upward of 500 computer terminals offering cheap Internet access. He has just announced that he will take the concept stateside, to Times Square, this fall. And then there is his latest idea, EasyRentacar, taking the low-cost concept to car rental in Europe. A Web site called easy.com, intended to be a discount portal for his own and other companies, is also in the works.</p>
        <p>The son of a Greek shipping tycoon, Mr. Haji-Ioannou, 33 and single (''I never have time. I'm always working.''), did not exactly have it difficult. So how does such a loaded man relate to his budget-conscious customers? ''It's difficult when you have so much money,'' he lamented.</p>
        <p>IN fact, he comes across less as a pampered heir than as an ambitious but irreverent man on the move. Mr. Haji-Ioannou has steadily evolved into a Greek version of Sir Richard Branson, the Virgin Group founder, championing consumer rights as an underdog fighting the establishment. Both have the same favorite corporate pinata: British Airways.</p>
        <p>When British Airways started its own low-cost carrier, Go Airlines, two years ago, Mr. Haji-Ioannou went to court seeking, without success, to ground it. He contended that British Airways was unfairly using market dominance to pressure airlines like his.</p>
        <p>Like Sir Richard, who painted ''No Way B.A./A.A.'' on the tail fins of his planes to protest  British Airways' proposed alliance with American Airlines, Mr. Haji-Ioannou has found offbeat ways to needle his rival. On the home page of EasyJet's Web site, he challenges customers to ''guess how much money B.A.'s low-cost clone has lost this year and win a pair of free flights!''</p>
        <p>Also like Sir Richard, Mr. Haji-Ioannou has become a celebrity of sorts here, appearing regularly on television and staging elaborate publicity stunts. On the day Go started flying, for example, Mr. Haji-Ioannou and his colleagues booked tickets on the inaugural flight, wearing EasyJet shirts in the company's customary bright orange, and handed out free plane tickets for his airline to other passengers.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Haji-Ioannou may not need to count pennies -- or even have his businesses turn a profit -- he says EasyJet is profitable; he is  planning an initial public offering in London this July. In his latest published financial statements, for the year ended September 1998, EasyJet flew 1.7 million passengers and earned $3.5 million. The airline has recently added 15 planes to its fleet, for a total of 33.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haji-Ioannou confirmed that his other businesses have yet to show that they can become profitable, saying that for now he was spending heavily to expand them. But his management style is clearly not about the dowdy details, like making money.</p>
        <p>''You don't need to be hands-on,'' he said. The reason he expanded his empire, he added, is that, in the airline business, ''I was delegating myself out of a job.'' ''I was more interested in starting companies and the concept than being hands-on,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haji-Ioannou wasn't always on the maverick entrepreneur path.  ''I was meant to be a successor to my father,'' he said, explaining that he became interested in business as a child, ''as soon as I stopped believing I could be a footballer'' -- or soccer player, in British terms.</p>
        <p>After graduating from the London School of Economics in 1987, he returned to Athens to work for his father's company, Troodos Shipping. Unfortunately, his father's business was, as he put it, ''a one-man show,'' and he was not that man. So he persuaded his father to let him start his own shipping company in 1992. ''This was considered major rebellion,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That company, Stelmar Tankers of Athens, which is still in business, soon became successful, and he began looking for other investment opportunities.</p>
        <p>During a visit to the United States in 1994, he took a flight on Southwest Airlines and became hooked. ''I used to always travel business class,'' he said. ''But I contracted the aviation bug. It was totally irrational.''</p>
        <p>His father lent him the $7.5 million he needed to start EasyJet in 1995; his older brother, Polys, and his younger sister, Clelia, also have stakes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haji-Ioannou almost single-handedly created the budget airline niche within Britain by resorting to out-of-the-way airports like Luton, outside London, and offering fewer amenities than even Southwest. Now he has set his sights on the Internet, where he got a taste of its potency by selling EasyJet tickets.</p>
        <p>ORIGINALLY, he wanted to create a pure dot-com but concluded, ''I couldn't get myself around a completely virtual business.'' So he resorted to building a gigantic new breed of Internet cafe. With EasyEverything set to cross the Atlantic this fall, Mr. Haji-Ioannou  and New York will get their first real tastes of each other. But then he has been traveling there for decades, business class -- though no longer on British Airways.</p>
