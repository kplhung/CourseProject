        <p>MOULTON-William G. Renowned Professor and Linguistics Scholar. William G. Moulton of Exeter, NH and Quonochontaug, RI died on Friday, June 2 after a long illness. He was 86. Prof. Moulton was an internationally known linguistics scholar, specializing in Germanic languages. Born in Providence, RI, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Princeton in 1935. After teaching at Yale, where he received his Ph.D in 1941, he went to Cornell from 1947 to 1960, and returned to Princeton to teach until he retired in 1979. Middlebury College and the University of Munich awarded him honorary degrees.Prof. Moulton was awarded a Fulbright and two Guggenheim Fellowships. Author of several books and multiple articles, active in the Linguistics Society of America and the Center for Applied Linguistics, he was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. During WWII as a captain in the army he wrote the army language series SPOKEN GERMAN with his wife Jenni, to teach German to American servicemen. As an American, his structural understanding of Germanic languages, from Old and Middle High German to modern day Swiss German, made him unique. His linguistic gift was to make complicated work simple and bring a light touch to serious studies. Prof. Moulton is survived by his wife of 62 years, Jenni Moulton, their daughters Elizabeth Farnham of Exeter, NH, Susan Moultan of Winchester, MA, four grandchildren and his brother David. A memorial service will be held June 16 at Riverwoods in Exeter, NH.</p>
