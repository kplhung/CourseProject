        <p>STERN MEN, by Elizabeth Gilbert. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) Gilbert's first novel concerns Maine fishermen on a pair of islands that are virtually at war; her protagonist, a smart, observant woman, teaches the uses of cooperation.</p>
        <p>THE WATER IN BETWEEN: A Journey at Sea, by Kevin Patterson. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $23.95.) A bored Canadian doctor, 29, conceives the idea of sailing to Tahiti in a small boat. He does so, and lives. He writes this book. It is really quite charming and instructive. Lucky guy!</p>
