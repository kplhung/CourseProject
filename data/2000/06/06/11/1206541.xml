        <p>Carrie Elizabeth Byrne and Alexander Nicholas Putelo were married yesterday morning by the Rev. John Richard Nelson, a Roman Catholic priest, at Tappan Hill in Tarrytown, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The bride, 28, is a manager in advertising sales at Bon Appetit magazine in New York. She graduated from Rutgers University. Her parents, Carol and James H. Byrne, live in Tenafly, N.J., where her mother is the borough tax assessor. The bride's father is the director of marketing communications at CBS Television in New York.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 27, is a projects analyst at Temco Service Industries, a buildings maintenance company in New York. He graduated from Hofstra University. His parents, Helen and Michael C. Putelo, live in Malverne, N.Y. His mother is an accounts receivable supervisor in Garden City, N.Y., for MCI Wireless. His father retired as a territory sales manager from the Whirlpool Corporation.</p>
        <p>The couple met in New York during a torrential April downpour one Friday evening in 1998. Mr. Putelo was walking down Eighth Avenue and ran for cover into Scuffy Duffy's, a bar near 46th Street. Ms. Byrne was already inside, having a drink with friends and outlining her definition of a perfect guy (someone handsome, tall and kind-looking). When she saw Mr. Putelo, she said to her friends, ''Someone like him!''</p>
        <p>Moments later, as he was wringing out his raincoat, she walked up to him and introduced herself. ''I've never had any problems approaching anybody,'' she said. ''Being in sales helps you handle rejection.''</p>
        <p>They talked for a while and as it turned out, he was very interested in her, although Ms. Byrne wasn't aware of that. ''I thought he was the most gorgeous man I'd ever seen,'' she said. ''We kissed that night, but I was convinced he wasn't going to call me.''</p>
        <p>The following Monday evening, while she was at home, watching ''Melrose Place,'' he called. ''When he said, 'Hi, it's Alex,' I almost dropped the phone,'' she remembered. Soon, they were dating seriously.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putelo's marriage proposal last Christmas inspired several reactions in Ms. Byrne. As she screamed ''Yes!'' and put on the engagement ring, her hand began to swell and turn red.</p>
        <p>''My entire left hand broke out in hives,'' she said. ''It was horrible. I thought, 'Oh my God! I'm allergic to platinum!' I actually took off the ring that night, and I put Benadryl all over my hand.''</p>
        <p>In the end, she learned she wasn't allergic to platinum, just exceptionally sensitive to the idea of getting married.</p>
        <p>''For two weeks, every time I would tell the story of our engagement, my whole left hand would break out again,'' she said.</p>
