        <p>By the time Claudia Kirschhoch set foot in Jamaica, she had lived in France for a year and had taken a handful of language courses. She worked as an editor for the Frommer's travel guide series and pored over maps with an intense curiosity.</p>
        <p>Her sister called her ''a very savvy traveler,'' and a fellow travel writer said she was ''bright and intelligent.''</p>
        <p>Those are just a few of the reasons that the disappearance of Ms. Kirschhoch, 29, more than a week ago from a beachside hotel on the Caribbean island of Jamaica has confounded her parents, friends and Jamaican police officials.</p>
        <p>Since June 1, the day Ms. Kirschhoch, a resident of Astoria, Queens, failed to fly back to New York as scheduled, Jamaican police officers have plastered their country with her photograph. Island newspapers have carried the story of her disappearance on their front pages. And her parents have flown to Jamaica and offered the equivalent of about $6,200 for information leading to her whereabouts.</p>
        <p>Still, the search has dragged on, from beaches to nightclubs, from posh hotel lobbies to street markets.</p>
        <p>''It's just a terrible feeling because you're helpless even though you know every effort is being made,'' said Deborah Martin, 34, Ms. Kirschhoch's sister. ''But we're very hopeful and confident we'll find her.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kirschhoch disappeared from the small resort town of Negril, on the lush western tip of Jamaica, while on a working trip sponsored by the Sandals resort chain, which has 10 luxury hotels throughout the Caribbean. Ms. Kirschhoch accompanied a freelance travel writer to Negril on May 25 after a Sandals-sponsored trip to Cuba was canceled during a stopover in Jamaica because of visa complications.</p>
        <p>The other writer, Tania Grossinger, said she returned to New York on May 27 after having a final buffet breakfast with Ms. Kirschhoch in the Beaches Negril hotel, where the two were staying.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kirschhoch was last seen by a lobby receptionist on either May 29 or May 30, police officials said. The two exchanged greetings. Nothing seemed amiss. But by June 1, Ms. Kirschhoch still had not checked out, prompting hotel workers to enter her room.</p>
        <p>There, they found her clothes, her passport, even her wallet, with cash and credit cards still inside. But there was no sign of her.</p>
        <p>Jamaica has long been popular with tourists, but recent years have seen a surge in street violence because of turf wars between rival drug gangs. Last year the number of visitors declined.</p>
        <p>Baffled police officials said they were keeping all possibilities open in their investigation into Ms. Kirschhoch's disappearance.</p>
        <p>''She tended to be interested in seeking out local color as opposed to doing organized hotel-type activities,'' Ms. Martin said. ''She's a very open and trusting person, completely without prejudice.''</p>
        <p>But by all accounts, Ms. Kirschhoch was not one to travel irresponsibly. Although she grew up in a modest two-story stucco home in the quiet suburb of Morristown, N.J., her family often took summer vacations, driving up the coast to Cape Cod or Maine. Her parents, Frederick and Maryann Kirschhoch, encouraged their children to travel, Ms. Martin said.</p>
        <p>Claudia Kirschhoch became an avid bird watcher and grew close to nature, the kind of person who often combed a beach for seashells, her sister said. In high school, she studied French. And after graduating from Washington &amp; Lee University with a degree in journalism, she lived for a year in Paris.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kirschhoch also dabbled in other languages, Ms. Martin said, and took frequent trips to places like Italy and the Canary Islands. She had played the violin since she was a toddler, and she loved reading poetry, newspapers and novels. In particular, she admired the writing of Paul Bowles. In Mr. Bowles's most famous novel, ''The Sheltering Sky,'' a woman vanishes into the Sahara while her lover desperately searches for her.</p>
        <p>After returning from France, Ms. Kirschhoch lived for several years in Morristown with her parents while working as an editor at small book publishers. Then last year, she landed an editing job with Frommer's, a position her sister called ''a perfect fit'' for her. She also moved into a one-bedroom apartment in Queens to be closer to Manhattan's cultural events.</p>
        <p>In recent months, the Frommer's job took Ms. Kirschhoch on a trip to Seattle and on a junket sponsored by the Walt Disney Company, Ms. Martin said. Then along came Sandals and the offer of a trip to Cuba. Ms. Martin said she last saw her sister at a family cookout on Mother's Day, May 14. The two chatted by telephone a couple of weeks before the Cuba trip, just catching up on each other's lives.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kirschhoch was offered the Sandals trip only after two of the four travel writers originally assigned to the journey canceled at the last minute, Ms. Grossinger said. On May 24, Sandals flew Ms. Kirschhoch, Ms. Grossinger and a couple from Chicago into Montego Bay, a tourist resort on the northwestern coast of Jamaica. There, the group was told that they would not be able to continue to Cuba because of visa problems.</p>
        <p>But Sandals offered the writers the option of staying at its Jamaican resorts, Ms. Grossinger said. The Chicago couple stayed in Montego Bay, while Ms. Kirschhoch and Ms. Grossinger caught a hotel van the next morning for the two-hour drive to Negril, a town with a seven-mile stretch of white-sand beach and a population of about 3,000.</p>
        <p>Ms. Grossinger and Ms. Kirschhoch checked into separate rooms in low-slung wooden buildings surrounded by lush tropical plants. They had balconies overlooking the ocean, Ms. Grossinger said, and king-size beds and terry-cloth bathrobes in their rooms. Rainstorms kept them off the beach most of the time, and Ms. Kirschhoch spent hours reading a book on Asian metaphysics. But the two writers shared meals together, eating jerk chicken during the day and having dinners at the hotel's Japanese and Italian restaurants.</p>
        <p>On May 27, they ate their last breakfast together, right before Ms. Grossinger flew back to New York. She said Ms. Kirschhoch mentioned that she wanted to see more of the island, including the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston.</p>
        <p>''We said that when we get into the city, we'll call each other and get together for lunch,'' Ms. Grossinger said. ''She was a bright and intelligent young lady with whom I would have been happy to continue contact.''</p>
        <p>But for more than a week, police officers have been asking people all over Jamaica whether they have seen a slim white woman, 5 feet 2 inches tall, with long brown hair. Last week, Michael Spring, the publisher of Frommer's, flew to Jamaica with Ms. Kirschhoch's parents to help in the search. The United States Consulate there has supported them at every turn by issuing press releases and holding news conferences, as well as by helping the police.</p>
        <p>But so far, all the efforts have yielded only frustration.</p>
        <p>''We have nothing whatsoever,'' said Superintendent Linette Williams of the Negril police. ''She likes to explore, she likes to go places on her own. As much as you want to be adventurous, how long would you go without checking in? But we still have hope.''</p>
