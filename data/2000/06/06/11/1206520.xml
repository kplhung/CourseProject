        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was very happy to read the review of the restaurant Rat's in Hamilton Township, in your May 2 section, because I was scheduled to eat lunch there a few days later with a group of friends. Boy. was your reviewer wrong.</p>
        <p>The first indication came when one of our group found she had a dirty knife. That was replaced, but then she was served coffee she didn't order. After waiting at least 45 minutes, we received our meals.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was very happy to read the review of the restaurant Rat's in Hamilton Township, in your May 2 section, because I was scheduled to eat lunch there a few days later with a group of friends. Boy. was your reviewer wrong.</p>
        <p>The first indication came when one of our group found she had a dirty knife. That was replaced, but then she was served coffee she didn't order. After waiting at least 45 minutes, we received our meals.</p>
        <p>When one of us asked for a roll or some bread, she was told that the bread was all in the freezer for the dinner crowd. After some convincing, the waitress found one roll for the whole table of five. Butter? In the freezer. Some did arrive just as the shared roll was finished. One person ordered the salmon ($18 at lunch) and received five cucumber-thin slices, nothing else.</p>
        <p>My food was fair, at best. The service all through the meal was  pretentious but amateur.</p>
        <p>A restaurant that charges the  prices that Rats does should provide skilled service, better timing of  courses, better food and bread. Oh, yes, the building is beautiful.</p>
        <p>This was, in a sense, the most expensive meal I have ever eaten, because it provided so little satisfaction. You might want to send your reviewer to check it out again. Oh, and don't ask for the manager. When I approached him after the meal, the best he had to offer was, ''You should have called me earlier.''</p>
