        <p>For years pundits have prophesied the paperless office. Yet there's more paper than ever these days. Why? Because it works. Paper boots instantly. It offers better resolution and higher contrast than a computer screen under all but the worst lighting conditions. Paper doesn't require a power source. It's incredibly cheap. You can take it to the beach. And you don't feel so bad if you lose it. As Neil Gershenfeld, director of the M.I.T. Media Lab's Things That Think consortium, likes to say, ''If the book had been invented after the laptop, it would have been hailed as a great breakthrough.''</p>
        <p>So what exactly are the marketers of today's e-books so proud of? Does anybody really want to read Danielle Steel, or a car-repair manual, or all 3,312 pages of Proust on a tiny, poorly lighted $300 computer screen? Joe Jacobson, a physicist at the Media Lab, has a better idea: it's called a book, the kind with paper. Like its feeble competitors, however, Jacobson's book is infinitely changeable. Press a button on the binding, and the ink inside instantly, cleanly rewrites itself: ''Moby-Dick'' becomes, say, ''War and Peace.'' Same paper -- tactile, portable, easy to read -- just new words. When you've read one book, you can call up another from the voluminous library stored in the cybermemory. Jacobson calls it ''the Last Book'' because, when he brings it into being a few years from now, it could be the last one you'll ever need.</p>

        <p>For years pundits have prophesied the paperless office. Yet there's more paper than ever these days. Why? Because it works. Paper boots instantly.

        <p>So what exactly are the marketers of today's e-books so proud of? Does anybody really want to read Danielle Steel, or a car-repair manual, or all 3,312 pages of Proust on a tiny, poorly lighted $300 computer screen? Joe Jacobson, a physicist at the Media Lab, has a better idea: it's called a book, the kind with paper. Like its feeble competitors, however, Jacobson's book is infinitely changeable. Press a button on the binding, and the ink inside instantly, cleanly rewrites itself: ''Moby-Dick'' becomes, say, ''War and Peace.'' Same paper -- tactile, portable, easy to read -- just new words. When you've read one book, you can call up another from the voluminous library stored in the cybermemory. Jacobson calls it ''the Last Book'' because, when he brings it into being a few years from now, it could be the last one you'll ever need.</p>
        <p>The key is electronic ink -- which Jacobson has already invented. His ''e-ink'' is composed of millions of microscopic capsules, each of which contains a soup of blue dye and tiny flecks of white pigment. When the capsules are exposed to an electrical charge, the white particles inside move around. A negative charge draws the particles to the top, turning the capsule white; a positive charge pushes them to the bottom, under the dye, so the capsule appears dark. Under a microscope, a sheet of e-ink looks like a bed of sea anemones winking open and shut. Viewed en masse, the capsules -- some black, some white -- give rise to letters and images, like placard-bearing fans in a football stadium.</p>
        <p>Coated with e-ink, an ordinary sheet of paper becomes reusable. Picture a special ''printer'' (Jacobson's team has already built it) that contains electrodes. A page of e-ink text goes in, the electrodes zap the e-ink -- switching some microcapsules from black to white or white to black, leaving others as they were -- and a page of new text comes out. Lately, Jacobson has dispensed with the printer altogether and has moved the electrodes onto the paper itself. He has created signs that consist of a sheet of e-ink sandwiched between two plastic sheets, one of which is essentially a transparent electrode. The sign's display can be updated by pager: from a remote computer, to a satellite, to an antenna, which sends radio signals to the sign's circuit board, which sends electrical signals to the e-ink. The power required to update the text is minuscule, a 10th of a watt.</p>
        <p>In 1997, this ink became the foundation for a start-up company, E Ink. Last June, E Ink's first commercial product -- updatable signs, based on the electrode-sandwich design -- began appearing in Eckerd drugstores. So far, however, the signs' circuitry is capable of producing changeable letters no smaller than two inches tall -- not exactly a portable ''Moby-Dick.'' So Jacobson is working on making everything smaller, designing circuits so tiny and cheap that a printer could spray them onto paper, alongside the e-ink. The electronics, in effect, would be disposable. Jacobson's ultimate goal is what he calls ''radio paper'': electronic paper, coated with e-ink, with tiny transistors embedded in it to act as electrodes, solar cells and radio receivers. So equipped, the average sheet of paper would be able to upload pretty much anything, even video, using no more energy than it draws from ambient light.</p>
        <p>''I fundamentally think five years is the right time scale for static paper to be phased out and replaced by radio paper,'' Jacobson says. His investors evidently agree. So far, E Ink has attracted more than $50 million in venture capital, much of it from book and newspaper publishers like the Hearst Corporation. Jacobson's primary competitor is Nick Sheridon at Xerox PARC, who has been thinking about electronic ink for the past nine years. Sheridon has developed an ink similar to Jacobson's: called Gyricon, it is composed of tiny spheres -- white on one side, colored on the other -- that rotate in response to an electric charge. With backing from 3M, Sheridon aims to enter the sign business soon (''We should have a product next year''), then proceed on, like Jacobson, to reusable paper, books and newsprint.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, your newspaper, when printed in electronic ink, would be utterly transformed. Which is to say, it would stay much the same, at least outwardly. The same oversize sheets of paper, the same soothing rustle. Go ahead, leave it splayed across the breakfast table: tomorrow -- or in an hour, or however often you like -- the contents will be updated by radio signal. Subway riders, desist in your origami antics: you can download your newspaper into a more manageable format -say, a book. Even your book could be smaller. The book's contents could be stored in microelectronics in the binding and called onto the page as you need them, even as you read. So unless you really need all 3,312 pages at once, your ''Remembrance of Things Past'' could simply fit in a pamphlet.</p>
