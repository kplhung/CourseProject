        <p>Some men are haunted by whisky till the day they die. Then there are the few who crave it long after they're dead. So it is said about Mr. Dare, the poltergeist who wanders the halls of an old saloon in central Queens.</p>
        <p>The Woods Inn sits on the dead end of 73rd Street near some lonesome railroad tracks in Glendale and is flanked on the east by the Lutheran All Saints Cemetery. It is a barnlike building with the windows permanently shuttered. The moonlight stops at the front door as if denied permission to enter.</p>
        <p>When the evenings turn gloomy and dank, the door is propped open a bit and a dull red light washes over the porch. Inside, the place is wood -- wall-to-wall wood -- and mixed with the light you feel as though you're floating in a wine casket. The washroom bulb quivers like a blinking eye.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Dare arrives the door will blow open or a whisky bottle will fall from the bar or a wallet may go missing. But he comes irregularly, and most evenings the place is inhabited by the undead of the district: the Goliath, the carbuncle-faced man, the baying barroom banshee and the city councilman. Mr. Dare never bothers them.</p>
        <p>''He don't hurt anyone,'' says Jimmy Soran, 23, who has a habit of stroking his goatee in a catlike way. ''He looks like a cross between a smoky shadow and a cloaked man. Things thump and move, but he don't hurt anyone.''</p>
        <p>Who exactly Mr. Dare was or how he died is a matter of speculation and lore. Some locals swear he passed away upstairs while in the romantic embrace of a woman of ill repute. Others says he was a grizzled old rummy who died of consumption in a rented room. One man believes he drank himself to death here. And still others believe he is a homeless soul whose grave nearby was violated to make room for a fresh body.</p>
        <p>''He don't smell and he's not cold either,'' says Mr. Soran, who gleaned his knowledge of such things from horror films. ''That would mean the place is possessed. It's not.  It's just haunted.''</p>
        <p>The Woods Inn is one of the oldest saloons in Queens. The bar is a hand-carved mahogany masterpiece from the German Black Forest and was installed in its current home in 1854. It is decorated with a lion's head and gargoyles. It has five mirrors and five supporting polls that are lathed in a counterclockwise swirl,  except for the middle, which goes clockwise. This is the signature of the artisan who carved it.</p>
        <p>The Woods Inn has in its time been a hotel, a cathouse and a blind pig. Its heyday began in 1868 when the rails came through and ironworkers would arrive on the Montauk line of the Long Island Rail Road. Dusty farmers arrived on horseback and tethered up outside. The hitching posts were stolen 15 years ago and the line was phased out two years ago because of a lack of customers.</p>
        <p>The same names have been patrons for generations, says Debbie McBride, the manager of the Woods. ''The regulars, their parents and their parents. And Mr. Dare of course,'' she says. ''Glendale never changes, and strangers don't wander through here too often anymore.''</p>
