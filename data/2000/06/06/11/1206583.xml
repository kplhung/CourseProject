        <p>THE new economy is here, and its emblems have become the commonplaces of a wired world. It is as if history itself has been compressed in the rush to enhance efficiency and wealth.</p>
        <p>Only a decade after the decline of the Filofax -- remember it? -- there is no longer any surprise that hand-held computers and cellular telephones offer e-mail and Internet access, even from sidewalk cafes. Devised for scientific research, the Internet has enfolded much of the industrialized world, supplanting the human interface.</p>
        <p>A younger breed may embrace the networked society. But amid the scramble for riches that accompanies economic upheavals -- from the Industrial Revolution to the stirrings of a technological revolution based on electric power more than a century ago -- there are always those who say that humanity will pay a high price for its inventiveness.</p>
        <p>If Jeremy Rifkin's ''Age of Access'' (Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam, $24.95) is anything to go by, then that price will outweigh the benefits for most people.</p>
        <p>For the entrepreneur, the new economy, with its stress on marketing and electronic access, yields capitalism's final victory over the basic Marxist notion that ownership of the means of production is the font of all power. But Mr. Rifkin argues that for Western consumers, it is the ultimate defeat, transforming them into ciphers of ''lifetime value'' whose every act, 24 hours a day, will be based on a commercial transaction.</p>
        <p>Books like ''The End of Work'' (Putnam, 1995) and ''The Biotech Century'' (Putnam, 1998) have established Mr. Rifkin, a fellow at the Wharton School's Executive Education Program, as a leading techno-pessimist. His latest book is no exception. For today's wired generation, he argues, the results represent nothing less than the victory of materialism over traditional society.</p>
        <p>''Imagine a world,'' he says, ''where virtually every activity outside the confines of family relations is a paid-for experience, a world in which traditional reciprocal obligations and expectations -- mediated by feelings of faith, empathy and solidarity -- are replaced by contractual relations in the form of paid memberships, subscriptions, admission charges, retainers and fees.'' He calls it ''the crisis of postmodernity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rifkin's starting point is that  the central principle underpinning a market economy -- ownership of property exchangeable in the marketplace -- is giving way to the idea of access to that same property for short-term, paid use.</p>
        <p>Put bluntly, it is the basic mechanism of car-leasing invented many years ago: rather than owning an automobile, the motorist leases it for a while, gaining access, Mr. Rifkin says, to what is increasingly depicted as ''the driving experience.''</p>
        <p>Within a networked economy, where outsourcing of work has come to replace full-time staff and where factories and physical capital may be accessed more easily than owned, the old, industrial principle ''becomes increasingly marginal to the economic process.''</p>
        <p>But the transformation goes deeper. ''While the industrial era was characterized by the commodification of work, the Age of Access is about, above all else, the commodification of play -- namely the marketing of cultural resources including rituals, the arts, festivals, social movements, spiritual and fraternal activity and civic engagement in the form of paid-for personal entertainment.''</p>
        <p>The nightmare, especially for an older generation, is that the individual becomes no more than a ''lifetime value,'' defined as ''the theoretical measure of how much a human being is worth if every moment of his or her life were to be commodified in one form or another in the commercial sphere.''</p>
        <p>It could be argued that it has always been this way. People in the developed world have long been ensnared in financial transactions, their every move from hospital delivery room to funeral parlor followed by large bills.</p>
        <p>But the parallel drawn by Mr. Rifkin is the impact of industrial change on American homes when the wage economy transferred basic activities -- the baking of bread, for instance -- from the home to the marketplace. In the cyberspace revolution, he contends, the social impact will be greater, transferring much broader segments of human existence into a commercial arena far more pervasive than the corner bakery.</p>
        <p>''What happens to the essential nature of human existence when it is sucked into an all-encompassing web of commercial relationships?'' he asks.</p>
        <p>THIS is a luxurious quandary, however, reserved for those with the wealth of the developed world. In one of the most stunning nuggets of information in the  book, he points out that ''more than half of the human race has never made a phone call.'' That is to say that technology has widened the gap between the haves and have-nots -- increasingly synonymous with the wired and the unwired.</p>
        <p>The broader implication of Mr. Rifkin's book is that the ultimate losers are the individual and the open society. The winners are what he calls the gatekeepers who control access to ''the popular culture and the geographic and cyberspace networks that expropriate, repackage and commodify the culture in the form of paid-for personal entertainment.''</p>
        <p>In this world, the survivors are ''the new men and women'' who have adjusted to the headlong pace of a wired society. For them, ''being disconnected is death,'' he says. And the winners -- the new moguls replacing the oil and steel and railroad barons of a bygone era -- will be a handful of global media companies.</p>
        <p>As a token of how rapidly his prophecies are being fulfilled, the Time Warner-America Online merger was announced as his book was awaiting publication, an event apparently too late for inclusion.</p>
        <p>If there is a leap of faith, or rather pessimism, in Mr. Rifkin's study, it is in the conclusion that, while humanity has more or less coped with previous economic revolutions, from the Middle Ages onward, this time the challenge from cyberspace, from the wired world, will be too great.</p>
        <p>Certainly, any regular Internet user is more than aware of the way that cyberspace has undermined traditional ideas of geography and supplanted judgments linked to physical space: an e-mail address is a far more nebulous concept than a street address with all its material and social implications.</p>
        <p>But in a way, some people would argue, cyberspace also adds a dimension, broadening rather than narrowing the human experience in the quest for knowledge, information and connectedness with fellow humans.</p>
        <p>Far more hazardous is the enormous commercial pressure that builds with the idea of an individual's lifetime value. One basic economic rule, as Mr. Rifkin points out, has not changed since Roman times: caveat emptor. In the brave new wired world, it will be ever more difficult for the buyer to beware of technology speeding forward in nanoseconds, controlled by global giants.</p>
