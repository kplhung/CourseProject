        <p>FOR the last 18 years, Argos Art Foundry in Brewster has been casting fine-art sculpture. Of the thousands of pieces cast at the foundry each year, the bulk of it goes to galleries or commercial installations around the world, but about 20 percent goes directly into private homes.</p>
        <p>While about 90 percent is bronze work, Argos also uses stainless steel, aluminum and silver. ''We cast all kinds of art,'' Roger Ericksen, a founder of Argos, said. ''But bronze is a classical medium, so most is classical, traditional figurative work, even in this day and age.''</p>

        <p>FOR the last 18 years, Argos Art Foundry in Brewster has been casting fine-art sculpture. Of the thousands of pieces cast at the foundry each year, the bulk of it goes to galleries or commercial installations around the world, but about 20 percent goes directly into private homes.</p>
        <p>While about 90 percent is bronze work, Argos also uses stainless steel, aluminum and silver. ''We cast all kinds of art,'' Roger Ericksen, a founder of Argos, said. ''But bronze is a classical medium, so most is classical, traditional figurative work, even in this day and age.''</p>
        <p>Though a lot of the residential work is done on commission, sometimes people decide they want to own a piece of sculpture after visiting the foundry. The Argos partners -- Mr.  Ericksen, Dennis Klubnick and Steven Roy -- introduce potential buyers to artists regularly. Mr. Ericksen said: ''There's always something being worked on here. The back room is aglow with molten metal. Someone is finishing bronzes up front. Others are working on wax molds. Artists are checking their work. People come here and get excited and want to own a piece of art themselves.''</p>
        <p>It takes a village to cast a piece of art, Mr. Ericksen said. ''The foundry is like a collection of separate small businesses under one roof, coordinated by myself and my partners,'' he said, describing the process that turns an artist's clay model into a finished piece of art. The first step is making an original mold from rubber (to pick up the details from the clay model) coated with plaster (to stiffen the rubber). Next, the rubber mold is used to make a wax image of the original. ''Everything that's wax will become bronze,'' Anne Huibregtse, a sculptor, said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ericksen said: ''The artists interact a lot at this stage. It's their last chance to put their touch on the piece. They check the details, and they sign it.''</p>
        <p>Next, a plumbing system that will feed molten metal to the right place, called gating, is attached to the wax. During the next step, investment, a heavy ceramic shell is built up over the wax. ''We dip the wax into heavy mud, a few layers each day,'' Mr. Ericksen said. ''This takes about a week.'' After the final layer is applied, the coating is allowed to dry for about 48 hours. Then it goes into the kiln, where the high temperature -- up to 1,700 degrees -- burns out all of the wax.</p>
        <p>The sculpture takes shape when molten bronze, heated to more than 1,900 degrees, is poured into the ceramic shell. ''The pours happen at the end of the day,'' Mr. Ericksen said. ''It sits overnight to cool. The solidification of the metal cracks the ceramic. Later, we hammer on the shell to knock away the ceramic without hurting the piece.'' The gating system is removed, and any ceramic residue is cleaned from the bronze with a high-pressure blast of glass beads. The piece is cleaned and smoothed; minor repairs are made, if necessary, and the bronze is ready to show to the artist.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes details have to be touched up,'' Mr. Ericksen said. ''Then the artist works with the patina person. They heat the piece and apply different chemicals to bring out different colors in the metal.''  Waxing, mounting and delivery complete the process.</p>
        <p>The village metaphor doesn't ring entirely true for Ms. Huibregtse. ''I feel tied to the place; it feels like family,'' she said. She started working for Argos six months after it opened; she was the second employee, and she stayed for 15 years before she quit to focus on art full time. Argos casts her pieces, and her tenure there continues to influence her work. For example, she works in wax, instead of clay, to bypass the initial molding process.</p>
        <p>Argos has about two dozen workers, some of whom are artists themselves. When interviewing potential employees, Mr. Ericksen said he tells them: ''You can't get creative with this work. You have to deliver to the artists what their intent is. Can you give up your own vision of art to work for someone else?''</p>
        <p>Besides artists, many of the Argos employees are former kitchen workers (''They're used to high heat, high pressure and getting stuff out on time,'' Mr. Ericksen said).</p>
        <p>Insure It, Ground It and Bolt It Down</p>
        <p>ADORNING the yard with original art might be a dream come true for some homeowners, but fulfilling dreams often means taking on responsibilities. Here are a few things to consider before any sculpture is installed.</p>
        <p>Tony Magnotta, co-enforcement officer of the White Plains Building Department, advises checking with local agencies to make sure installation plans comply with preservation and zoning requirements and the building code. For example, that ideal location might turn out to be in the midst of a grove of endangered copper beech trees. A building permit is required if the sculpture sits on a platform or is bolted down.</p>
        <p>''A huge piece of metal sculpture could act as a lightning conductor, and must be grounded,'' he said. Also, be sure the work doesn't protrude into an easement or right of way.</p>
        <p>Another issue:  Neighbors might object that a subject was offensive, or commercial. ''If a real estate appraiser says a house nearby will sell for less because of your sculpture, that could be a problem,'' Mr. Magnotta said. ''These rules are on the books. Can they be enforced? Maybe not, but they can cause trouble.''</p>
        <p>You must have insurance. Roger Ericksen of Argos Art in Brewster, said theft can be an issue -- regardless of the sculpture's size and weight, but vandalism is a more likely issue.</p>
        <p>Once the sculpture has been installed, it requires a little upkeep. ''Take care of bronze like you take care of your car,'' Mr. Ericksen advised. ''Wash it with a mild detergent, let it dry in the sun, gently wax it with something like butcher's wax, bee's wax or carnuba wax, then buff it off.''</p>
