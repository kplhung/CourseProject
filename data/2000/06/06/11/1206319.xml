        <p>CURATORS, collectors and dealers of tribal art converged last month on Sotheby's in New York to view, gossip about and bid small fortunes for two 19th-century Polynesian rarities: a brilliantly colored Hawaiian feather cape and a curious Austral Islands necklace of whalebone, ivory and human hair. Their obscure histories (they were unknown to scholars until the sale was announced in January) and their freshly restored condition made them hot topics of discussion in tribal art, a field considered one of the most rumor-ridden in today's art market. Such concerns notwithstanding, the objects brought record prices for Polynesian art.</p>
        <p>Long the battle garb of kings and warriors, feather capes and cloaks are the most glorious of all Hawaiian objects. Even after contact with Europeans 300 years ago, each garment, patterned as graphically as paintings by Calder or Miro, was unique, a status symbol at court or the most sumptuous royal gift to foreign visitors. The necklace was also worn by champion warriors in the Austral Islands, part of the Cook group, who, it was said, were allowed to possess any woman while wearing it.</p>
        <p>The cape sold at Sotheby's is made of vivid yellow feathers and emblazoned, shoulder to shoulder on the back, with a double crescent image of black feathers above, red below, that looked like a joyous smile. The necklace is an exotic assemblage of plaques and spheres carved from whalebone and whale ivory, strung on a cord wrapped in human hair. While admirers praised it as more complete than the 14 other known examples, critics said it had been overly restored and looked bleached.</p>
        <p>The artifacts had been exhibited for more than a century at the Niagara Falls Museum, a private showcase for natural history specimens that was popular with tourists but unknown in the art world. No one knows when or how the the museum acquired these two treasures. ''The museum's acquisition records on these two pieces do not survive,'' said William Jamieson, a Toronto building contractor turned dealer who, with a friend, bought the museum's name and most of its contents last year and is now selling the collection.</p>
        <p>It is hardly surprising that the records were lost. The museum has had a succession of owners since it was founded in 1827 on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls by Thomas Barnett, a British-born taxidermist. It remained in the hands of Barnett and his son, Sydney, until financial reversals forced them to sell it at auction in 1878. An archrival, Saul Davis, bought the museum and in 1888 moved it to the United States side, where he expanded it in the 1890's, adding the Woods Museum Collection of Chicago. Three owners later, in 1958, the museum was moved back to Canada, where it remained until Mr. Jamieson bought it.</p>
        <p>Confusion over when the museum acquired the pieces was further compounded by conflicting statements made about them in Sotheby's catalog. Both, it states, were acquired ''in the 19th century by Thomas Barnett, for the Niagara Falls Museum.'' Elsewhere, under an entry detailing the history of the museum, the catalog states, ''These items apparently originated from the Woods Collection.''</p>
        <p>When asked about the discrepancy, Jean G. Fritts, Sotheby's chief specialist in tribal art, said: ''It's not possible to pin down the exact date that the cape and necklace entered the museum collection. We should have said, 'Possibly acquired by Thomas Barnett.' ''</p>
        <p>Before sending the cape and necklace to New York, Mr. Jamieson had the pieces cleaned by conservators in Canada. ''The feather cape was filthy dirty,'' said Tom Govier, director of conservation at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Hull, Quebec. ''It was with us a couple of months. We used a small brush to remove the surface dirt, a vacuum with a nozzle smaller than a dime to remove the dust, and pure products, not commercially produced detergents, to wash the feathers. We found no paint on the feathers. Usually one sees a lot of moth damage on feather capes. There was some evidence of larva on this one, but very little.''</p>
        <p>He said the absence of serious moth damage might indicate that arsenic, a preservative favored by taxidermists in the 19th century, was present on other objects when the cape was displayed at the museum and left some traces on it.</p>
        <p>That the cape and necklace had been restored was known to many at Sotheby's sale on May 19, but it seemed not to discourage the bidding. The cape, estimated to sell for $250,000 to $350,000, was sold for $335,750; the necklace, expected to bring $175,000 to $250,000, was sold for $313,750. The previous auction record for Polynesian art was the $240,800 paid in 1977 at Christie's in London for a larger, more sumptuous feather cloak from the James T. Hooper collection. That relic was eventually bought by the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter and Adelaide de Menil, a collector who later became his wife. They gave the cape to the Menil Collection, her family's museum in Houston.</p>
        <p>''I was told that the feather cape had been damaged in a fire, that the feathers had been painted on and that there was wax on the back,'' said David Lindal, a decorator from Honolulu, who bought the cape with James Granzow, his partner in David James Interiors. ''I figured that the dirt and wax, if there was any, probably protected the feathers. Anyway, we never before had a chance to buy any tribal Hawaiian item as spectacular as this. And we had no intention of letting the cape go anywhere else.''</p>
