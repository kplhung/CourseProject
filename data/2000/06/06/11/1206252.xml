        <p>THE WHITE SHARKS</p>
        <p>OF WALL STREET</p>
        <p>Thomas Mellon Evans and</p>
        <p>the Original Corporate Raiders.</p>
        <p>By Diana B. Henriques.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 368 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>A Lisa Drew Book/Scribner. $27.50.</p>
        <p>There are surely few phenomena more remarkable in American business than the periodic ability of cash-poor but swashbuckling newcomers, using little or none of their own money, to seize control of some of the country's most valuable corporations. In its most recent, frenzied incarnation, dot-com entrepreneurs have exchanged stock in companies with few tangible assets and even fewer profits for control of established, profitable companies. Fifteen years ago, the currency was junk bonds rather than inflated stock. And before that, it was bank loans using a target's assets as collateral.</p>
        <p>Wall Street greets each wave of takeovers as the dawning of a new era. But the proposition that nothing has fundamentally changed is convincingly set forth in ''The White Sharks of Wall Street,'' an engaging and thorough history of early corporate takeovers by Diana B. Henriques, a financial reporter for The New York Times. Her central character is Thomas Mellon Evans, who surfaces in what seems like nearly every trendsetting corporate battle from 1945 until his retirement in 1984, and whose tactics remain essential to practitioners of corporate warfare. Junk bonds? Greenmail? Scorched earth? Evans had been there long before investment bankers coined a catchy vocabulary to describe the maneuvers of people like T. Boone Pickens, Carl Icahn and Saul Steinberg.</p>
        <p>Though Evans seems to have escaped the widespread public resentment and envy the others generated, and Henriques's portrait is carefully nonjudgmental, it is difficult for a reader to work up much sympathy for him. He was ruthless, bad-tempered, usually indifferent to workers and communities. He repeatedly displayed what appears to be a criminal disregard for the antitrust laws (though he was never prosecuted). He divorced two wives (the second later committed suicide), and both times a replacement was conspicuously at hand long before any legal proceedings had begun. He betrayed two of his own sons in his quest for corporate dominance and wealth.</p>
        <p>Orphaned at the age of 11 in Pittsburgh, later taken under the wing of his prominent but distant relatives the Mellons, Evans was poor but grew up in a milieu of inherited wealth and privilege to which he evidently aspired. In later life he mingled prominently in old-line society, and took up art collecting and horse breeding. True to his class and era, Evans was frustratingly taciturn throughout his life, betraying little emotion. It is hard to tell whether any of his achievements, wives or riches brought him much satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Yet as a deal maker Evans displayed a natural audacity and genius. In 1935, 24 years old and lacking any money to speak of, he decided he wanted to gain control of Pittsburgh's struggling H. K. Porter Company, a manufacturer of steam locomotives. Inspired by a Fortune magazine account of Floyd Odlum, who became rich by using borrowed securities as collateral for loans to buy undervalued stock, Evans borrowed shares from a Mellon mentor, took out a loan and invested in Gulf Oil stock, then a Mellon enterprise. When Gulf's stock rose handsomely as the nation emerged from the Depression, Evans used his profits to buy Porter bonds, then selling for a small fraction of their face value. When Porter finally had to declare bankruptcy and was reorganized, Evans, as the largest creditor, traded his bonds for equity and became the largest shareholder. Porter, essentially acquired for junk bonds, would be Evans's vehicle for most of his life.</p>
        <p>Like many who followed in his footsteps, Evans was not much of an operations man. He shrewdly hired experienced managers while he pursued his real interests, which were balance sheets and deals. He turned his attentions to the Mount Vernon Car Manufacturing Company, a rail car manufacturer that was the economic mainstay of tiny Mount Vernon, Ill. The company was on the block for $2.7 million, even though it had over $3 million in cash. Such was the nation's aversion to debt and its paucity of capital in 1944 that no one but Evans seemed attracted to such an obvious bargain. Nor would any commercial bank lend Evans the $2.7 million until he hit on the idea of selling Mount Vernon's rail car division and using the expected proceeds as collateral for the loan -- in other words, using as collateral something he did not yet own. Pittsburgh bankers balked at the unorthodox proposal. But Evans found financing in New York and completed the purchase. In 1946, showing scant interest in the town of Mount Vernon or the company's employees, he sold off the company's core assets. Mount Vernon proved to be another model that was widely copied: buy an undervalued, underperforming company using its own assets as collateral for borrowed money; ruthlessly slash operating costs and improve profitability; then break it up and sell the pieces at a profit -- the forerunner of the leveraged buyout perfected by Henry Kravis.</p>
        <p>Though he was a wealthy man by the mid-1950's, Evans never lost his zeal for corporate battles, even as other players came on the stage (several of whose stories are told here in less satisfying detail), the stakes rose and the tactics became tougher. Henriques painstakingly recounts Evans's numerous forays: his discovery that even unsuccessful attacks can yield handsome profits; that price fixing boosts profit even if it is eventually detected; and, in a flurry of mid-70's takeover fights, that Establishment credentials are a poor defense to a well-mounted hostile bid. Throughout, Evans displayed the cool, even heartless detachment that brought opprobrium to more recent corporate raiders.</p>
        <p>In the book's most dramatic narrative, Henriques recounts Evans's willingness to betray his son Sheldon, who was both a board member and executive vice president of the venerable Crane Company, the Chicago plumbing-fixture manufacturer Evans had conquered in a hostile 1960 maneuver. Without informing his son, Evans secretly negotiated in 1984 to sell the company at a price that seemed unfair to shareholders -- a deal that would have cost Sheldon his job. He rallied Crane's independent directors, who canceled the sale and accepted Thomas Evans's abrupt resignation -- a matter father and son never spoke of again.</p>
        <p>Still, surely Evans would have admired his son's fortitude, and at Evans's funeral 13 years later, it was Sheldon who delivered the eulogy. ''It is not always easy to be the son of a great man,'' he said. ''And he was a great man. His business career was legendary, innovative and ahead of its time. . . . He loved the 'hurly-burly' of the marketplace.''</p>
