        <p>In the most physical game yet of the Stanley Cup finals, Devils forward Petr Sykora was flattened by the Dallas Stars' Derian Hatcher in the first period tonight, a blow that sent Sykora to the hospital.</p>
        <p>The tone of the game -- ultimately won by the Devils in double overtime -- was set before it was four minutes old when Darryl Sydor injured his left knee while spinning off a check by the Devils' Scott Gomez.</p>
        <p>Eight minutes later, Sykora was skating into the Dallas zone with the puck on his stick on the right side at the point, with Dallas defenseman Sylvain Cote in front of him. Sykora tried to elude Cote with a move from right to left and Cote whacked Sykora in the midsection with his stick.</p>
        <p>An instant later, Hatcher, the captain of the Stars, came flying across and knocked Sykora on his back while Sykora was not looking. No penalty was called.</p>
        <p>Sykora stayed motionless on the ice for several minutes. His head was immobilized, and he was strapped onto a stretcher before being taken to nearby Baylor Medical Center for evaluation. The results of a CAT scan were normal, and Sykora was going to stay in the hospital overnight.</p>
        <p>Hatcher said in a television interview during the first intermission that Sykora was moving and talking afterward.</p>
        <p>Hatcher also whacked the Devils' Jason Arnott -- who scored the goal tonight that gave the Devils the cup -- in the face in Game 4, an incident that cost Arnott six teeth. No penalty was called on that play, either.</p>
        <p>Asked about his hit on Sykora, Hatcher said: ''He was coming down across the blue line with his head down. Just stepped into him. I'm not sure what happened, but they said he was moving and talking.''</p>
        <p>With Claude Lemieux leading the way, the Devils tried to go after Hatcher at the end of the first intermission because he had also tried to get Gomez and Jay Pandolfo before the Sykora incident.</p>
        <p>Hatcher went after Gomez because he thought that Gomez had hurt Sydor in the first incident of the night. The television replay indicated that Sydor actually hurt himself as he fell backwards against the boards. Sydor left for the dressing room and did not return.</p>
        <p>Scott Stevens, the captain of the Devils who is known for big hits of his own, intervened when Hatcher went after Gomez. Stevens flattened Eric Lindros of the Philadelphia Flyers in the Eastern Conference finals, and Lindros suffered a concussion.</p>
        <p>Dallas Coach Ken Hitchcock said before this series began that the Stars would never allow a man to take out any of their players in the Stanley Cup finals.</p>
        <p>''Look, they've got a guy that takes people out,'' Hitchcock said, referring to Stevens. ''And we are not allowing that. He takes one of ours, we've got to take two of his.''</p>
        <p>Stevens and Hatcher were in the middle of a melee with 6 minutes 12 seconds left in the second period and were both penalized for roughing. They growled at each other as they took their places in the penalty box.</p>
        <p>There were 104 hits in the first two periods tonight -- 57 by the Stars, including 8 by Hatcher. In the triple-overtime game on Thursday night, there were 88.</p>
        <p>Fans in Reunion Arena initially cheered Hatcher's hit, perhaps because two members of the Stars -- Sydor and center Joe Nieuwendyk -- were injured earlier in the period.</p>
        <p>Sydor was hurt after he got tangled with Gomez at 16:40. With the puck in the opposite corner of the Dallas zone, Sydor tried getting up to chase the play, but he could not put any weight on the leg. He dropped to all fours. Play was stopped once he had scooted near the Dallas goal. He kept his left ankle off the ice as he was helped to the locker room.</p>
        <p>Just 28 seconds later, Nieuwendyk wound up sprawled on the ice on his back, barely moving. He remained that way for several seconds.</p>
        <p>Nieuwendyk, who was the Conn Smythe trophy winner in last season's playoffs, was flipped onto his head by Arnott after they met in a face-off. Arnott caught his stick under Nieuwendyk's left thigh and jerked Nieuwendyk into the air. No penalty was called. He walked off on his own power and was back without missing a shift.</p>
