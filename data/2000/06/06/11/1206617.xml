        <p>Moet &amp; Chandon's Matrimonial Matrix, which measures cost of 12 key elements of luxury wedding, has risen just 2.3 percent over last year, while five-year annual average is 3.6 percent; numbers of weddings in US is expected to be higher than annual average of 2.4 million, perhaps because it is year 2000 (M)</p>

        <p>It turns out, for better or for worse, that ''I do's'' are expected to reverberate more than usual this year. While there are about 2.4 million weddings, on average, in the United States annually, the number is expected to be far greater this year, perhaps because of the cachet of a new-millennium wedding date.</p>
        <p>And wedding suppliers, for the most part, are not raising their prices, according to Moet &amp; Chandon, the Champagne maker, whose Matrimonial Matrix annually tracks the cost of 12 key elements of a luxury wedding in New York. The index has risen just 2.3 percent over last year; the five-year annual average is 3.6 percent.</p>
