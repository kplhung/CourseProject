        <p>SURVIVORS and newcomers to Connecticut's once-prominent textile industry have specialized, diversified and pumped large investments into high-tech, computer-driven operations.</p>
        <p>''The textile industry in Connecticut peaked in the middle of the 20th century and, to survive, the companies remaining have had to make significant changes in their operations,'' said Peter Gioia, an economist with the Connecticut Business and Industry Association in Hartford.</p>
        <p>''None of the companies could have survived without a lot of innovation,'' Mr. Gioia said. ''Companies that are still viable have had to make significant changes and run streamlined and equipment-intensive operations.''</p>
        <p>According to the association's membership, the state's textile industry consists of manufacturers in 13 categories. Most of the companies, Mr. Gioia said, produce specialty products ranging from sailcloth to armored vests.</p>
        <p>The textile specialty of one manufacturer, Warren of Stafford, originates with the Kel goat in China. The goat's silky cashmere fleece makes the long journey in bales to Stafford Springs, where it is woven into high-priced fabrics worn by the well to do.  More than a dozen framed, commissioned photographs of the pampered goat, which is native to Kashmir, give an artsy, sleek decor to Warren of Stafford's headquarters in the center of town.</p>
        <p>It's a dramatically different atmosphere from the one engendered by the century-old mill's former life in the rural, eastern Connecticut town, where Italian, German, Polish and other immigrants first ran the looms, and where the company's original specialty was camel's hair cloth.</p>
        <p>Warren of Stafford, whose origins parallel the birth of the textile industry in New England, has been reborn as the only United States affiliate of the Loro Piana company. Loro Piana, a family-owned textile empire, is headquartered in northeastern Italy, near Biella, which is considered the high-end textile center of Italy. After buying Warren of Stafford in 1988, Loro Piana retained the mill's name in appreciation of local history. The site works well because of its closeness to New York City, the heart of the fashion industry and the site of one of Loro Piana's marketing offices. By the time Loro Piana arrived, however, Warren of Stafford's operations, like those of many textile mills in the Northeast, had shrunk.</p>
        <p>According to the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, in Washington, D.C., the industry remains dominant in the southeastern United States, where eight states produce some 75 percent of the United States gross domestic product in textiles.</p>
        <p>Like the Connecticut mills, the entire United States textile industry went through peaks and valleys during the 20th century as a result of wars, economic booms and downturns, trade agreements and foreign competition. ''The last gasp in Connecticut was really the 1980's, when the last of the big mills gave up the ghost,'' said Bruce Clouette, a lecturer in history at the University of Connecticut in Mansfield who compiled the list of historic textile sites published in the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
        <p>The United States textile industry today is a $69-billion-a-year operation, representing 8 percent of all manufacturing jobs, and employs 600,000 people in 26,000 companies in virtually every state. In Connecticut, which is still considered a manufacturing-intensive state with some 270,000 manufacturing workers, the textile industry has a tiny percentage, with 2,400 employees. Warren of Stafford represents 10 percent of that textile work force.</p>
        <p>The company's fine quality woolen and worsted fabric is turned into expensive apparel -- suits, jackets and coats -- for clothiers like Hickey-Freeman, Joseph Banks and Brooks Brothers. Ninety percent of Warren of Stafford's business is directed to United States markets, and a high percentage of that is in men's wear.</p>
        <p>''Our custom division sells to the tailor industry in the United States, and their customers include many wealthy businessmen and sports figures,'' said Roberto Modica, the company's 37-year-old vice president of operations. ''Often sports figures have a difficult time finding suits in a retail store, and some of the tailors we sell to make suits for basketball players.''</p>
        <p>Loro Piana has invested $40 million in modernization of its Warren of Stafford affiliate, most in computerized machinery.</p>
        <p>''The investment was necessary, so we can better compete with the textile mills in Europe and Asia,'' Mr. Modica said. ''Our annual sales are $30 million, but we have the capacity and potential today to double that figure.'' For Bill Horowitz, 47, president and chief executive officer of Amerbelle Corporation, a specialty textile manufacturer and local landmark in Vernon, serving the customer, especially the international customer, is a high priority.</p>
        <p>''We're seeking to grow partnerships in Europe, South America and Asia,'' Mr. Horowitz said. ''It's important to these different cultures to know and feel comfortable with their business partners.</p>
        <p>''Many U.S. business people are growing up with e-mail as the culture of communications,'' he continued. ''It's important to understand that other cultures, such as the European, seek to break bread to develop personal relationships and gain trust. This requires the personal contact and rapport that so many Americans have lost the skills to develop.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Horowitz, whose grandfather was the senior founding partner of Amerbelle in 1936, has seen a dramatic change in the company's product line over the last six decades. Historically, the company dyed fabrics used primarily as linings for apparel like women's dresses and skirts, hats and men's outerwear. In the 1960's and 1970's, as those products became more sensitive to import competition, the company shifted to industrial fabrics for products like backpacks, bulletproof vests and parachutes.</p>
        <p>''The company has once again reinvented its product line,'' Mr. Horowitz said. ''Today, we service companies that need specialized colors, finishes and coatings for high-end fashion uses.''</p>
        <p>Those uses range from high-performance outdoor apparel for sports like skiing, mountain climbing and kayaking, to sailing gear and soft luggage.</p>
        <p>Throughout the 1990's, Mr. Horowitz said, the company made significant capital investments in computerized dyeing equipment. ''When many New England textile companies closed or chose to relocate in the South, we remained committed to the people in our local community,'' Mr. Horowitz said.''The textile heritage of New England is still alive here.''</p>
