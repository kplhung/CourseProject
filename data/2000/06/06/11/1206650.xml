        <p>The stock market may be climbing but President Clinton told graduates of Carleton College today that the degrees they were clutching would prove to be a better investment than anything Wall Street could offer.</p>
        <p>''Over the course of a career, a person with a bachelor's degree will earn, on average, $600,000 more than a person who has a high school diploma,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''The return on a college investment is now nearly double the stock market's historical rate of return.''</p>

        <p>The stock market may be climbing but President Clinton told graduates of Carleton College today that the degrees they were clutching would prove to be a better investment than anything Wall Street could offer.</p>
        <p>''Over the course of a career, a person with a bachelor's degree will earn, on average, $600,000 more than a person who has a high school diploma,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''The return on a college investment is now nearly double the stock market's historical rate of return.''</p>
        <p>In the final commencement address of his presidency, Mr. Clinton touted the increased importance of education today, and recounted the initiatives his administration has pushed to open up college to more students.</p>
        <p>''Today, opportunity requires the constant ability to learn and relearn, to master new tools and new technologies, to think broadly, to adjust quickly, to put things in context,'' the president told the 423 graduates in a 27-minute speech. ''It means every American needs more than a high school education. It means a college education is not a luxury.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton pointed out that he was the first in his family to go to college thanks to financial aid. ''I am well aware if it hadn't been for that chance that I had so long ago now to go to school, I wouldn't be standing here today,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton lamented that his education initiatives, including a proposal to make college tuition tax deductible, remained tied up in Congress. Republicans want education funds to be distributed to the states in block grants, that the state could use for any programs, including private school vouchers. The White House prefers to direct the money to programs that would help repair schools, reduce class sizes and provide mentors for teachers.</p>
        <p>''Think about this,'' Mr. Clinton said after urging leaders in Congress to adopt his agenda. ''A hundred years from now, the Carleton Class of 2100 will be sitting where you are. They'll look up at this podium, and perhaps they'll see a president reflecting on the 21st century, the good old days. I hope that he or she can say that we began this century the right way.''</p>
