        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The problems caused by the transition to managed care are enormous, but ''New H.M.O. Fight: Medical Discipline'' (May 28) missed an important aspect of the debate.</p>
        <p>The common perception among health care consumers (formerly known as patients) is that coverage by a health maintenance organization provides all the care options needed to ensure health. In fact, it means coverage for what an employer has chosen to pay. The same insurer may deny coverage under one policy and approve it under another.</p>
        <p>Managed-care plans are notorious for saying to doctors, ''We don't tell you how to practice medicine, only what we will pay for.'' Scapegoating the person who has to enforce decisions of employers and benefits managers misses what has happened in the new market-based economics of health care. The employer has become the buyer, the managed-care organization has become the seller, and the patient is not a party to the transaction.</p>
        <p>Care plans are not created equal. Some exclude home health care, drug rehabilitation, even pregnancy. It is imperative that patients get complete information about what is and is not covered, and that they put unrelenting pressure on benefits departments for comprehensive policies.</p>
