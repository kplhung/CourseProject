        <p>Five years after a watershed conference held in Beijing articulated and affirmed what more than 180 nations could agree were the universal rights of women, a weeklong follow-up meeting ended yesterday at the United Nations with no significant victories for opponents who have tried to reverse those gains.</p>
        <p>An all-night session Friday into yesterday, capping a week of heated arguments, preserved a range of women's rights including the most contentious, that ''women have the right to decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality'' and can do so without ''coercion, discrimination and violence.''</p>
        <p>Around the world, this can mean something as basic as choosing a spouse or avoiding genital mutilation in the name of tradition.</p>
        <p>''I'm very happy that the dire predictions that there would be a rollback have proved false,'' said Angela King, the United Nations official in charge of women's advancement.</p>
        <p>''We were determined to get a strong document that did not in any way diminish the gains women had achieved in Beijing,'' she said. ''We were also determined to go beyond Beijing, and we did, despite the efforts of countries that made the process such an arduous one.''</p>
        <p>Although some Western and international women's groups failed to expand definitions in the Beijing document to include more explicit homosexual rights, broad definitions of ''family'' and more clearly stated support for safe and readily available abortions, other issues did make advances.</p>
        <p>Delegations from 180 nations, urged on from the sidelines by representatives of about 1,200 nongovernmental organizations, took strong stands on the trafficking of women and girls, who are sold or lured across borders by the sex trade or for domestic or industrial work that often amounts to wage slavery.</p>
        <p>Delegates also agreed on strong planks that call for punishment of domestic violence, including marital rape, which some delegations had argued was essentially a private matter not recognized as a crime in many nations. There were also calls to outlaw the killings of women whose families claim have shamed them, so-called ''honor'' crimes that have drawn attention to countries like Jordan and Pakistan.</p>
        <p>United Nations officials and women's rights campaigners say that this is the first time an international document has specified these activities as crimes. Although the final agreement of the conference does not have the force of law, it can be used by women as a statement of international norms when trying to change the laws of nations.</p>
        <p>The meeting's final declaration also demanded more attention to the H.I.V.-AIDS epidemic, which in the five years since the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing has begun to victimize many more women, especially in Africa. There, women's organizations say, the sexual rights of women are a matter of life and death, when traditions within extended families or clans may force girls and women into sexual arrangements they cannot avoid with men whom they may know to be infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.</p>
        <p>As is almost inevitably the case when sensitive social issues are exposed to international debate, battle lines were drawn between conservative countries, largely Islamic or Roman Catholic, and more secular nations, though there was no fixed geographical pattern. Poland and Nicaragua, for example, have often been reticent on certain women's rights, while Europe and Latin America in general take a much more liberal stand, even on contraception and abortion.</p>
        <p>Among Islamic nations, delegates said, Algeria, Iran, Libya, Pakistan and Sudan were most reluctant to advance women's rights. The opposition lobby got strong support from the Vatican, which attends such conferences based on its territorial possessions in Rome.</p>
        <p>Among the organizations that expressed disappointment yesterday  were the Center for Women's Global Leadership at Rutgers University, and the Women's Environment and Development Organization in New York. They issued a statement regretting the failure to agree to a stronger document.</p>
        <p>Anna Diamantopoulou, a Greek politician who is now the European Union's commissioner for employment and social affairs, was not concerned that the conference did not push too hard on the limits of what the majority of national governments or societies could accept. She warned of the danger of provoking a backlash against women's groups in many countries if they returned with a declaration that could be interpreted as a call to upset the social order.  ''When they go home, they want to be waving the document, not apologizing for it,'' she said.</p>
