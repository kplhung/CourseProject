        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for highlighting Queens on your cover (''The Queens Diaspora,'' May 21). As a lifelong resident of Queens (born in Astoria and now living in North Flushing), I'm constantly astounded by the number of Queens expats I run into around the country. Nearly every business trip I take results in at least one encounter with an ex-Queens resident. Most recently, while out in San Francisco picking up a rental car, the woman behind the counter revealed that she'd grown up in Flushing and still had family here.</p>

        <p>Thank you for highlighting Queens on your cover (''The Queens Diaspora,'' May 21). As a lifelong resident of Queens (born in Astoria and now living in North Flushing), I'm constantly astounded by the number of Queens expats I run into around the country. Nearly every business trip I take results in at least one encounter with an ex-Queens resident. Most recently, while out in San Francisco picking up a rental car, the woman behind the counter revealed that she'd grown up in Flushing and still had family here.</p>
        <p>People living in Queens do, as you noted, consider themselves residents of Flushing, Astoria and the like rather than Queens proper. For this reason, I registered a number of internet domains (i.e. Flushing NY.com, FreshMeadowsNY.com, LICNY.com, etc). The goal is to eventually build community-based Web sites providing local news, discussions, government services and more, as the majority of Web sites claiming to be New York City search sites operate under the notion that Manhattan alone qualifies as New York City.</p>
