        <p>The problem with the Concorde is that its pilots need a window to take off and to land. Enabling pilots to see is what results in that heavy, drooping nose, and the nose is what makes the Concorde a somewhat sluggish supersonic plane.</p>
        <p>In the past 10 years, as part of NASA's High Speed Civil Transport program, engineers have figured out a way to get rid of the window. They've developed what's called the eXternal Visibility System (X.V.S.): interior sensor displays that recreate the external world in digitally enhanced, computer-generated graphics. The pilot flying an X.V.S. plane sees the same generic runway on takeoff and landing, but specific details like the horizon, the runway's white lines, ground objects and other planes in the area appear on the screen in sharp relief.</p>
        <p>To date, pilots have performed more than 90 windowless approaches and landings in planes equipped with preliminary X.V.S. models. Harry Verstynen, the chief research pilot at NASA's Langley Research Center, says his initial reaction to the windowless cockpit was ''not only 'No' but 'Hell, no!' ''But now, having flown in an X.V.S. -equipped plane, Verstynen says the system ''has distinct advantages over a window, which works only in the visible spectrum.''</p>
        <p>By eliminating the need for pilots to actually see outside the plane, X.V.S. makes it possible for engineers to design a supersonic jet with a tapered, missilelike nose that results in less drag, expends less fuel and allows the plane to travel at speeds unattainable by the Concorde. Engineers are even trying to create multifunctional, moving wings that would enable supersonic jets to travel in subsonic mode while flying over land, then to open up to Mach 2.4, emitting sonic booms, only while over the ocean.</p>
        <p>Daniel Goldin, a NASA administrator, predicts that these developments will help fend off the threat that teleconferencing and the Internet currently pose to international business travel. Once they dispense with the ''heavy, costly and complicated'' design of the Concorde, Goldin imagines, a global fleet of about 1,000 supersonic planes could make trans-Atlantic flights in about the time it takes to fly from New York to Chicago, and fly from New York to Southeast Asia in a little more than six hours.</p>
        <p>All this for a round-trip fare that could cost about 20 percent more than it currently costs to fly coach. ''We're good at moving electromagnetic waves around,'' Goldin says, ''but we can't neglect moving people.''</p>
