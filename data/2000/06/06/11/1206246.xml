        <p>My Quest for the Yeti</p>
        <p>Confronting the Himalayas'</p>
        <p>Deepest Mystery.</p>
        <p>By Reinhold Messner.</p>
        <p>Translated by Peter Constantine.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 169 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>St. Martin's Press. $23.95.</p>
        <p>Contrary to the teaser title, Reinhold Messner does not capture, stuff and mount on the page the anthropological find of the century -- the missing link, the Abominable Snowman, the yeti. Instead, this mountaineering master introduces us to a tall, shy, flat-footed species of brown bear with terrible posture, short legs, long arms and a shaggy coif not unlike Mick Jagger circa 1972. To Tibetans, this all too earthly creature is known as a chemo, a word not coincidentally synonymous with ''yeti'' in parts of the Himalayan highlands. Though it's rather like ripping the beard off Santa Claus, Messner's ''My Quest for the Yeti'' employs a decade's worth of research and educated guesswork to argue that Central Asia's Bigfoot is nothing more than a supersize Paddington.</p>
        <p>While Messner makes no mention of how the chemo-yeti connection escaped previous zoologists and explorers, his own meandering path to this eureka moment began innocently enough. In 1986, during a trek through Tibet, he spotted a massive, unidentifiable biped loping through the forest. A pair of oversize footprints added credence to his suspicion that the gigantic silhouette was the legendary yeti. For anyone else stumbling through the remote Tibetan highlands, with little more sustenance than some bacon and hard bread, a yeti sighting could be chalked up to oxygen deprivation. Yet Messner is made of steelier stuff; he was the first to climb Mount Everest alone -- without bottled oxygen. On his numerous trips to the region (he visited Nepal 30 times in 15 years, spent months at a time in Tibet, China, Bhutan and India), he had listened skeptically to the Sherpas' dubious yeti stories: how these wintry beasts abduct girls in the night, throw stones at villagers, snack on yaks.</p>
        <p>Suddenly -- in fact, a bit too suddenly to feel plausible -- he is a true believer. Messner discounts the theory that the yeti is an archetypal image concocted by the collective unconscious. For the next 10 years, he stalks the myth's ''zoological blueprint,'' his obsession taking him from village to Himalayan village, where he inquires about chemos and yetis and mooches buttermilk, yogurt and barley flour from generous residents. He even consults Sir Edmund Hillary's famous Sherpa companion, Tenzing Norgay. But locals are reluctant to talk about yeti sightings for fear of bad luck. When monks purport to have sacred remains of the creature stashed in their monasteries, Messner reveals them to be fake. Meanwhile, he is chased by vicious dogs, a member of his party contracts blood poisoning, and the Chinese police, who don't like nosy Europeans traveling through Tibet, are on his tail.</p>
        <p>This chemo hunt would be couched in ample drama if only Messner weren't oblivious of the gold mine of material his daily life produces. The emotional range and intensity of his prose often have all the excitability of Arnold Schwarzenegger reading the phone book aloud. Perhaps when you've climbed all the things worth climbing and lost seven toes to frostbite, nothing surprises you. It's the easy arrogance of the adventurer, the controlled efficiency of the climber. But when he allows himself to take in the postcard vistas, Messner proves that he's not incapable of satisfying the armchair explorer. Viewed through his seen-it-all eyes, the influence of Chinese occupation on Tibet -- the kitsch, congestion and concrete barracks replacing the gabled rooftops, bright prayer flags and trees -- is freshly devastating. His command of yeti tales is also impressive, from the story of Zana, a domesticated yeti who in the late 1800's bore human children, to the yeti corpse found in a Minnesota freezer in 1968.</p>
        <p>Reading ''My Quest for the Yeti'' (translated from the German by Peter Constantine), we never completely understand how an upright grizzly-type bear could be mistaken for a giant monkey-man in the first place. This nagging question leaves the door to the legend slightly ajar. Then again, these days, with the grandest of mountains having been conquered, it's probably for the best that our natural myths remain untamed.</p>
