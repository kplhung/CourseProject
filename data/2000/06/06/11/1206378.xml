        <p>I HAVE a habit. Walking.</p>
        <p>One morning on my way to the railroad station, my neighbor Peter drove by and beeped.</p>
        <p>''Do you want a lift?''</p>
        <p>''Thanks, but it's a beautiful day.''</p>
        <p>And I waved him on. He smiled back, but I could see suspicion sweep his brow.</p>
        <p>Most Long Islanders begin each outing by turning a key in the ignition. Cars are commandeered for trips of any distance. While I was accustomed to walking to the train station, dry cleaner and bakery, a stretch of time without our second car meant longer pilgrimages on subordinate sidewalks.</p>
        <p>Newbridge Road, a two-lane main drag, was undergoing a major renovation, getting a middle turning lane. The pitted roadway had tested cars' suspension systems long enough; crumbling curbs and uneven sidewalks were begging for a facelift. Now concrete pipes large enough for me to walk through were lined up along the roadside, waiting to be lowered into freshly dug ditches.</p>
        <p>On a wet day, I set out on the muddy path. Nearing the pipes, I hear voices. Sets of eyes look up at me as I pass with a smile. Just kids hanging out where they thought adults would not deign to walk.</p>
        <p>This is my driving route to Metro Modes Hair Salon. But today I'm on foot. I see a new deli, good to know, and browse in an old nursery with great flowers I had never noticed. When I reach the parking lot, I see women with telltale roots and uneven bangs climb out of carpeted Camrys and Explorers. In the reception area, I glimpse myself in the mirror: my cheeks have a rosy glow, as if I just cantered across a meadow.</p>
        <p>Later, lined up with other ladies sitting under dryers, half hemispheres for heads, black capes from neck to knee, synchronized legs crossed, I notice everyone's shoes. Mine are the only ones caked in mud.</p>
        <p>Walking home, my hair has that magazine-cover quality, a state of careless perfection, shimmering under the sun and bouncing along as I stride. A few men beep their car horns. It's my hair. But I wonder if it's also the element of surprise in finding a perfectly coifed woman walking by mounds of dirt.</p>
        <p>You can't really know your neighborhood unless you walk its streets. Besides, you don't get the dirt driving by. When I approach Terry, who is sweeping out his garage, he stops to chat and tells me the Maloneys are selling. Further on, Marge is unloading groceries and I learn that the Bellmore Playhouse is expanding to seven theaters. From the sidewalk I hear the new neighbors in the blue house playing Sinatra.</p>
        <p>A few years ago my town's downtown became uninviting, the result of too many empty stores, a Main Street that would never woo Martha Stewart to shop. Thanks to county, state and federal money and the hard work of community leaders, the Bedford Avenue Revitalization Project took off, and Bellmore Village was born.</p>
        <p>A driver won't miss the new sign for Bedford Office Supplies and Printing, or the new awning on La Margherita Pastry Shops, but he might miss the good ol' days. In addition to the movie theater, Old Brooklyn Pizza and the International Dessert Cafe, the revitalization provides a peek into the past.</p>
        <p>Erected along Bedford Avenue are antique lampposts, sitting benches and kiosks with old photos, courtesy of the Bellmore Historical Society. One caption reads, ''Mrs. Lorenzo Hein in Hunt's Store,'' and shows a woman with a floor-length apron next to a potbellied stove in the middle of a general store, the predecessor to Albert's Hardware. A 1930 photo shows Mr. and Mrs. Erwin von der Heydt in Gennaro's Jewelry leaning on glass-covered cases; the ashtray is a sign of a different time.</p>
        <p>I spied a copy of Bellmore Life from 1965 celebrating its one-year anniversary, and carrying a front-page story about the Long Island Lighting Company. Perhaps times haven't changed.</p>
        <p>In another kiosk hangs a 1940 New York Worlds Fair license plate and a photograph of Bedford Avenue showing Lubert's Dry Goods and Luthin's Drug Store opposite Whelan's Drug Store, not too different from today's rivals, CVS and Genovese.</p>
        <p>And as you walk the new herringbone-brick sidewalks, you don't miss the handwritten signs in the shop windows. The Italian bakery reminds shoppers ''Don't forget St. Joseph's Day.'' Augie's Shoe Repair advertises ''We repair Hush Puppies.'' Lone Wolf Tattoo advises ''No smoking, alcohol or drugs, please.''</p>
        <p>Heading for the library, my last stop, I wait for the light to change at the corner of Sunrise Highway and Bedford Avenue. Six lanes of heavy traffic whiz by. I look east, the wind in my face, the sun at my back. The oncoming cars are heading into the soon-to-be setting sun, and I can see clearly into the cars and into the cab of an oncoming 18-wheeler.</p>
        <p>I see the truck driver look directly at me, the only pedestrian around. His hand reach for a cord. His horn blares. Then he signs ''I love you'' and smiles. A smile spreads across my face and I think, perhaps we don't need a second car.</p>
