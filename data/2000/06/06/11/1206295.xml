        <p>IT looked easy on the map. But three days after I set out for northeastern Spain to explore the Maestrazgo mountain range in Aragon, I found myself alongside a complete stranger with my rental car in reverse gear. He was helping to free me from an impenetrable construction roadblock.</p>
        <p>This volunteer had the unmistakable redolence of a sheep farmer. His assistance wasn't entirely disinterested; he needed to hitch a ride to join his flock out of town. I had bypassed a convoluted detour on my way to a road (A1702) highlighting the crags and precipices of El Maestrazgo (mah-es-TRAHTH-go). The town in question was Calanda, birthplace of Luis Bunuel.

        <p>IT looked easy on the map. But three days after I set out for northeastern Spain to explore the Maestrazgo mountain range in Aragon, I found myself alongside a complete stranger with my rental car in reverse gear. He was helping to free me from an impenetrable construction roadblock.</p>
        <p>This volunteer had the unmistakable redolence of a sheep farmer. His assistance wasn't entirely disinterested; he needed to hitch a ride to join his flock out of town. I had bypassed a convoluted detour on my way to a road (A1702) highlighting the crags and precipices of El Maestrazgo (mah-es-TRAHTH-go). The town in question was Calanda, birthplace of Luis Bunuel. This did not seem like an appropriate moment to discuss the film director's work.</p>
        <p>To get to this mud-strewn stalemate I had  taken a train to Aragon's capital, Zaragoza, and driven some 100 miles southeast to Alcaniz, where the parador, in the 18th-century part of the castle, became my base. I planned to visit some of the medieval villages of the Maestrazgo, reputedly impervious to time, enclosed by walls and crowned by castles. Equally seductive to me was their setting of mountains with the deep  ravines, clefts and peaks unique to the region. I am neither courageous nor daring,  but I have a perverse tendency to seek out roads that test my fear of heights.</p>
        <p>There are three mountain ranges in Aragon: the Pyrenees on the French border, the Maestrazgo and the Montes Universales. On this bright, chilly morning, the Maestrazgo, the least frequented of the three, seemed elusive. The farmer did not share my embarrassment in chugging backward on Calanda's eviscerated main street.</p>
        <p>Aragon has an impeccable cultural lineage: occupation by the Romans, the Visigoths, the Moors and finally the Spanish who brought it to a power and glory long since diminished. But for most of us, Aragon's heritage comes into focus with the marriage of its king, Ferdinand, to Isabella of Castile, thus uniting Spain. They finally defeated the Moors and financed the discovery of an America destined to bring great wealth to Iberia. Their daughter Katherine became the first of Henry VIII's six wives.</p>
        <p>But Aragon has become a part of Spain that people pass through rather than visit for its own sake. Its capital, Zaragoza, is about halfway between two tourism magnets, Madrid and Barcelona, which typifies the problem. In fact, Aragon -- south from its Pyrenees ski country with its seven ski resorts, down through historic towns, mountain ranges, rivers and deserts -- offers an entirely rewarding destination.</p>
        <p>Go right, the farmer said. ''Now, stop. At last.'' That final ''Por fin'' carried layers of exasperation. It was already 10 a.m. by the time he left me for his sheep on the far side of Calanda. ''You'll never make it,'' his farewell glance told me.</p>
        <p>I was headed for two towns, Villarluengo and Cantavieja, and reaching them demanded a climb to elevations above gorges where gray-rock pinnacles resembled giant organ pipes. The two-lane paved road was narrow, twisting, roller-coaster undulating.  In two hours' journey on this road I encountered perhaps three cars.</p>
        <p>Far below, between the road and the rock pinnacles, along the basin of a deep gorge rushes the River Pitarque. The trout fishing here is said to be the best in Spain.  On this scary road, unprotected by railings, drivers need someone beside them while dexterously avoiding a slide over the cliff. That passenger could describe the serried stone spires, some of them thin and serrated, that slice the horizon. Spectacular is an entirely justified term here. But hurried glances at peaks are the best the lone driver can do.</p>
        <p>Around noon I arrived at the village of Villarluengo, at an elevation of about 4,000 feet in the Maestrazgos. A proud sign at the entrance of the village tells of its defensive 12th-century role in Spanish history. After that, Villarluengo seems to have rested on these militaristic laurels. Leaving my car at the walled entranceway, I trudged along narrow hilly streets empty of humankind.  Silence prevailed. Not a person appeared. Here were the Middle Ages stripped clean of their population. Finally I came upon a woman standing motionless by an arched doorway. I wished her good day. She whispered a muted response. The cobblestone alleyways echoed my footsteps. I don't recall any village so vacant and silent. As in one of my childhood dreams, I felt as if I were  the sole inhabitant of that world.</p>
        <p>I passed a schoolyard. At that moment a door burst open and the entire student body of perhaps 30 youngsters, all ages and sizes, began running in file around the perimeter of the building, laughing and shouting. Their joyful response to being alive in this remote Aragonese village hinted at how much was hidden from a casual visitor's eyes.</p>
        <p>I drove three miles back to have lunch at the Hostal de la Trucha (trout), the only habitation of any kind I had passed on the lengthy road to Villarluengo. This unpretentious hostal (once a paper factory) may rank among Spain's most remote getaways. No one will ever find you here. On its broad brick-surfaced terrace, where I rewarded myself with a beer and tapas before lunch, the only sound was that of a swiftly moving stream leading through pines to a series of fish hatcheries. Immediately to the left rose one of the Maestrazgo's stark stone-ridged cliffs, while in front of me tall conifers traced the bank of the stream. To my right were a small swimming pool and a tennis court. The November sun, surprisingly intense, beat down. I closed my eyes.</p>
        <p>Like almost every traveler, I recognize that moment in a journey enfolding and persuading you that here, away from the stress of the world, lies the answer to an unexamined quest. Even as you savor the idea, you know it is impractical and irrational. You may avoid stress by  fishing at the Hostal de la Trucha, but your serenity will be hermitic.</p>
        <p>BEYOND Villarluengo on Route A1702, I passed La Canada de Benatanduz, overlooking a fearsome treeless gorge, before arriving at Cantavieja. I saw more residents here than at Villarluengo and I was especially taken with the unpaved Plaza Mayor, kept that way should bullfights be scheduled. The town buildings are mostly whitewashed, offering a harmonious blend of arches and wrought-iron balconies.</p>
        <p>''Are you an American?'' a young boy asked me, gazing at my baseball cap. I offered it to him. What I needed on this journey to the Maestrazgo was not shade for the eyes but telescopic lenses. I had planned to continue on this demanding road, barely discernible on the map, but I knew that at nightfall the route would become pointlessly hazardous.</p>
        <p>I returned to my base in Alcaniz, a town as old as Aragon itself. Encircled by the Guadalope River and the city walls, the town's defensive hill visible from all approaches is surmounted by a castle-convent dating from the 12th and 13th centuries, now the Parador La Concordia. Originally built by the Calatrava knights, the castle's uninviting reconstructed 18th-century facade belies its handsome interior. I stayed in one of the 12 rooms with commanding views. My room had appropriately austere but comfortable furnishings and a capacious modern bath. On one side of the baronial dining room, cutlery and crystal gleamed on a refectory table laid with 50 place settings. Alcaniz is lively and crowded, its handsome streets lined with Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque buildings.</p>
        <p>The next day I traveled southwest, deftly maneuvering this time around the Calanda roadblock, to the town of Albarracin in the Universales mountains of Teruel province, somewhat to the east of the Maestrazgo proper. Once an independent Moorish kingdom, the town has crenelated Moorish walls that rise 36 feet to protect an architecturally eccentric interior, already enclosed on three sides by a  river. Walking through the narrowest streets imaginable, you sense that the roofs are leaning toward one another to form a covered passageway. Albarracin, one of Aragon's gems and a national monument, is all angles: streets, steps, buildings, walls. Rose-colored houses are dressed with red-tiled roofs, iron grilles on their windows, fretted woodwork on their balconies. The steep cobbled alleyways have an undeniable Arabic flavor, subtly enhanced by Renaissance artistry.</p>
        <p>Close by, the quiet and unassuming provincial capital town of Teruel hides a tormented past. Near the five Mudejar towers built by Moors under Christian rule after the Reconquest are the tombs of the 13th-century Lovers of Teruel, Spain's star-crossed version of Romeo and Juliet,  as well as their mummified remains. But what haunts the town is the memory of the the slaughter of over 1,000 young men in the winter of 1937 after the Nationalists overcame their dogged resistance during the Spanish Civil War. A visit to the cemetery about three miles out of town is searingly painful.</p>
        <p>My final day in the Maestrazgo took me through lush mountainous country as I drove from Alcaniz to  Morella. Traversing dark green foothills thick with pines and spruce, the N232 had undergone extensive highway work, an unexpected bonus.</p>
        <p>As I drove up to the walled town of Morella, over 3,200 feet above sea level (the Mediterranean was only about 40 miles to the east), a fierce wind crackled the rampart's banners. A gigantic rock topped by a crumbling castle looms over the town, of Roman and Arabic heritage. Morella has four entrance gates proudly arched in its high walls. Instinctively, I chose the wrong one in my search for Hotel Cardenal Ram.</p>
        <p>You must enter the right gate, leave your car and walk the steep, narrow, cobblestone streets, often no more than passageways. My hotel was a 16th-century Castilian town house with creaky uncarpeted floors.  In the chairless small room, a stone window alcove overlooked an alley. But it was cozy and heated, with a small bathroom and TV.</p>
        <p>I had a 3 p.m. Sunday dinner in the nearby Meson del Pastor, filled with families. I was the only person dining alone, and assuredly the only non-Spaniard. I began with dry sherry and a bowl of sopa de bunuelos Morellense, a steaming vegetable soup with delectable small floating pastry shells, a salad, and a large pitcher of the local tinto, a red wine that persuaded me to order the rabo de buey (oxtail) -- an unlikely dish for a diner as gastronomically timid as I.  The dining room was noisy with conversation and laughter and at one point a fellow diner asking for the salt called me caballero, a form of address unique to my experience.</p>
        <p>Since the freezing wind had become particularly fierce, I abandoned my plan to climb up to the castle and instead explored the twisting, escalating streets offering window shopping for everything from hand-knitted sweaters to countless varieties of honey with stacked spoons to sample them. I remember Morella fondly even though as I was leaving the next morning I found that a prankster had jammed the lock of my car door with chewing gum.</p>
        <p>Driving back to Zaragoza by way of Alcaniz to catch the train to Madrid, I briefly visited Calaceite, a handsome town of stone houses with heraldic shields and a porticoed Plaza Mayor. I was distracted by the air, dusty and sand-laden, dimming the cloudless sky. Later, on the open highway in the Monegros desert area, a fierce windstorm blew tumbleweed across the highway. The storm and the surrounding arid terrain recalled vintage dust-bowl scenes in the American West.</p>
        <p>If you go</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
