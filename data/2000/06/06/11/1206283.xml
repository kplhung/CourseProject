        <p>On and off since 1969, Eric Herr has been trying to make life imitate television. It all started with ''Star Trek,'' specifically those phaser guns Captain Kirk and his crew used to freeze, but not kill, their enemies. Herr decided the world needed something like that, and lately, technology has been catching up with his dreams. He has worked with scientists at the University of California at San Diego to test early prototypes of a nonlethal phaser, and he's now talking to private companies about bringing one to market.</p>
        <p>Herr says his weapon marries two relatively common technologies: tetanization (a form of electrical stimulation widely used in anesthesiology) and lasers. The laser beam itself is harmless ultraviolet light, about a half inch in diameter, with a soft-green glow. But when an electrical current is channeled into the ionized air created by the laser -- and aimed at a human target -- the charge instantly contracts a person's skeletal muscles. For at least a few seconds, the victim is unable to move, but suffers no lasting injuries.</p>

        <p>On and off since 1969, Eric Herr has been trying to make life imitate television. It all started with ''Star Trek,'' specifically those phaser guns Captain Kirk and his crew used to freeze, but not kill, their enemies. Herr decided the world needed something like that, and lately, technology has been catching up with his dreams. He has worked with scientists at the University of California at San Diego to test early prototypes of a nonlethal phaser, and he's now talking to private companies about bringing one to market.</p>
        <p>Herr says his weapon marries two relatively common technologies: tetanization (a form of electrical stimulation widely used in anesthesiology) and lasers. The laser beam itself is harmless ultraviolet light, about a half inch in diameter, with a soft-green glow. But when an electrical current is channeled into the ionized air created by the laser -- and aimed at a human target -- the charge instantly contracts a person's skeletal muscles. For at least a few seconds, the victim is unable to move, but suffers no lasting injuries.</p>
        <p>Today the prototype is as big as a carry-on suitcase and costs approximately $100,000. By 2010, if not before, Herr predicts, it will be the size of a flashlight and cost a few hundred dollars.</p>
        <p>Lt. Sid Heal, an authority on nonlethal weaponry with the Los Angeles County sheriff's department, says that such a device is highly prized by law enforcement, but he worries that it may end up helping criminals as much as it does cops. And Heal doesn't buy the idea that the phaser will be painless. He should know. For demonstration purposes, he has been shot with a Taser gun on three separate occasions. (Tasers fire electrically charged darts that stun the victim in a similar way.) ''Having experienced electromuscular disruption,'' says Heal, ''there's not too much I wouldn't do to avoid it.''</p>
