        <p>Re ''Best of Friends, Worlds Apart'' (front page, June 5):</p>
        <p>Born in Puerto Rico, I moved at age 9 to Humble, Tex. I was an instant novelty to my peers -- someone who spoke Spanish but who didn't look Mexican. I worked very hard to erase this difference, to assimilate, and my coloring allowed it. By high school, I had succeeded in turning myself into a virtual Texan.</p>

        <p>Re ''Best of Friends, Worlds Apart'' (front page, June 5):</p>
        <p>Born in Puerto Rico, I moved at age 9 to Humble, Tex. I was an instant novelty to my peers -- someone who spoke Spanish but who didn't look Mexican. I worked very hard to erase this difference, to assimilate, and my coloring allowed it. By high school, I had succeeded in turning myself into a virtual Texan.</p>
        <p>I did not have a single Latin friend. I had completely denied my heritage.  When my parents spoke Spanish in public, I would shush them -- how dare they embarrass me?</p>
        <p>Now that I am no longer ashamed of my background, I can't fully reclaim myself. And it is a loss. I mourn the lost stories and the lost traditions. It's fine to belong to a new culture. It's useful. But not at the expense of your identity and self-esteem. I wish I'd understood that in my adolescence.</p>
