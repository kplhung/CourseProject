        <p>LAWRENCE-Jacob. Age 82. Born Atlantic City, NJ 1917. Died peacefully at his home in Seattle, WA June 9, 2000. Survived by his beloved wife of 59 years Gwendolyn Knight. Jacob Lawrence was a gracious and generous man of enormous talent and integrity who remained true to his unique artistic vision for over 60 years. His devotion to teaching and encouragement of younger artists was unparalleled. His humanistic approach to life and art was an inspiration to all who knew him. We will treasure and honor our memories of his inestimable friendship. Memorial Service in New York to be announced. Donations in lieu of Flowers to Jacob and Gwendolyn Lawrence Foundation, 300 Commercial Street, Boston, MA 02109. Bridget Moore, Edward DeLuca and the staff of DC Moore Gallery</p>
        <p>LAWRENCE-Jacob. The Board of Trustees and staff at the Whitney Museum of American Art note with great sadness the passing of Jacob Lawrence, a beloved artist in our Permanent Collection. Lawrence employed a variety of compositional devices and close harmonies of color to create series of paintings that convey powerful scenes with strong narrative content. Lawrence was a magnificent artist whose work has and will continue to leave a great impact on American art. We extend our most heartfelt condolences to his family and friends. Leonard A. Lauder, Chairman Joel S. Ehrenkranz, President Maxwell L. Anderson, Director</p>
