        <p>THE OBITUARY WRITER</p>
        <p>By Porter Shreve.</p>
        <p>216 pp. Boston:</p>
        <p>Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Company. Paper, $12.</p>
        <p>Unhappy Gordie Hatch! Twenty-two, just out of journalism school and exiled to the obituary desk of The St. Louis Independent. Entry level doesn't get much more entry. He sits under a lead-removal fan, pulls copy off the A.P. wires and takes calls from funeral directors and bereaved relatives who can't (or won't) get the deceased's age right. And when he tries to make the job a little more interesting by writing his own ''advancers'' -- premature obituaries of famous people -- his editor publicly humiliates him, in a way that only older men can do. ''If I had wanted the obituary desk to have an advancer file,'' the editor barks, ''I'd have asked for it a long time ago.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, reporters just a few years Gordie's senior have trampolined from local police beats to overseas bureaus and are now giddily tracking the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet juggernaut. (It's 1989, the annus mirabilis of foreign-news coverage.) And if that weren't competition enough, there's the ghost of Gordie's father, who, as Gordie's mother so tediously reminds him, was among the premier newshounds of his age, one of the ''lodestones of history'' who witnessed the Kennedy assassination and rode it into the journalistic firmament.</p>
        <p>Porter Shreve's disarming first novel, ''The Obituary Writer,'' is about what happens when a potentially career-making story lands in Gordie's bony lap -- in the person of Alicia Whiting, an attractive young widow who doesn't seem to be grieving quite the way she should. ''You know what happens to widows who keep their husbands' clothing in the closet?'' she asks. ''They keep going back in there looking for memories. Movie stubs in blazer pockets. Little notes and lost dollar bills. I'm not going to be one of those widows.''</p>
        <p>It's all the same to Gordie, whose social life has been largely confined to eavesdropping on police radio dispatches. He can't get Alicia out of his brain; he can't forget her navy crepe dress, her black cloche. ''She had an unexpected quality,'' he realizes, ''an odd combination of formality and freedom, cardigans and chiming bangles, white flowers and ticky-tack, grand observations followed by self-mockery.''</p>
        <p>And she's got something else, too: a story. It's just a little hard to pin down. There's that little unpleasantness with her late husband's relatives. And there's an unpleasant love affair in Tucson with a painter of landscapes and nudes. And possibly some very unpleasant business with a suicidal science student in Fort Worth. Alicia, it seems, has changed herself to accommodate every man she's ever met . . . and then made each one disappear. She's the poster child for self-reinvention, and just as Gordie is struggling to get a handle on the current identity, she's busy forging a new one. She wants to be a reporter. Just like Gordie.</p>
        <p>''The Obituary Writer'' has the lean, propulsive structure of film noir, and on the surface it has all the archetypes, too: the intrepid young reporter, almost too dumb to live; the mysteriously deceased husband and his embittered spinster sister; and, of course, the black widow, draining men of their essence and swallowing them whole. What Shreve does so well, though, is to break down these archetypes, to reveal them as nothing more than the characters' self-aggrandizing constructs.</p>
        <p>Resume padding is, in fact, the central activity of ''The Obituary Writer.'' And no one does it more determinedly than Gordie, who, to impress Alicia, pretends to be a crack investigative reporter. And whenever Gordie's powers of invention fail, other characters rush to fill the void. His mother, for instance, finds out he missed a reunion date with his high school girlfriend and instantly embroiders an excuse for him: Gordie was hiding out in a warehouse, spying on a money-laundering city official. ''I hated to lie, Gordie,'' his mother says. ''But I had to tell her something.''</p>
        <p>Tell them something. That's the Scheherazade compulsion that drives the obituary writer -- and the fiction writer -- and pretty much everyone in this book (with the exception of Gordie's levelheaded old girlfriend, who is also the least interesting character). Shreve is not a colorful stylist -- though he is nicely economical -- and he has demanded perhaps a little too much credulity from his protagonist. But he has written an involving and sneakily touching story whose twists feel less like the conventions of a genre than the convolutions of a heart -- any heart. ''The Obituary Writer'' reminds us that we're all writing our own advancers, minute by minute.</p>
