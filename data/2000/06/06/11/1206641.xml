        <p>COMMENDABLE is indeed commendable. He took a spring sabbatical, and then somebody had to win the Belmont yesterday, so Commendable did.</p>
        <p>It's too bad the general population regarded the Belmont as strictly leftovers, but Commendable will always have the Belmont -- and what's wrong with that?</p>
        <p>After all, Brian Doyle had one great World Series, Bob Nystrom scored a goal to win the Stanley Cup, and Brandi Chastain made a penalty kick to win the women's World Cup, and nobody can take it away from them.</p>
        <p>Waiting for the superhorse can be a drag. Counting on Japanese patrons and other well-heeled types with a few yen in their pocket to storm to Belmont Park for a Fusaichi Pegasus Triple Crown, real fans and speculators had gobbled up the 34,000 Belmont seats shortly after the Japanese-owned horse won the Kentucky Derby.</p>
        <p>Investing in tickets is a form of gambling, just like betting on the horses or owning horses, for that matter, or playing the stock market. Go, baby, go, indeed. A recuperating Fusaichi Pegasus and a resting Red Bullet were nowhere in sight yesterday as Commendable became the first horse ever to run the Derby (he finished 17th), skip a prep race and then win the Belmont.</p>
        <p>D. Wayne Lukas, who held Commendable out of the Preakness, does not think there is any moral to the story.</p>
        <p>''You take what's right in front of you,'' Lukas said after the race. ''When the horse is good, let him perform.''</p>
        <p>There is a distinct sense of deprivation at yet another year without a Triple Crown winner, but it could be worse. The people who run racing are talking about raising the stakes for the Triple Crown races, so that owners and trainers of these delicate, overbred animals will be more tempted to enter them in the three races within five weeks.</p>
        <p>In other words, everything has a price. That is surely true in the owners' boxes as well as most other corners of the world, but the racing people should not be proud of the clamor to raise the ante for the Kentucky Derby ($1,038,400 to Fusaichi Pegasus) the Preakness ($650,000 to Red Bullet) and the Belmont (worth $600,000 to Commendable).</p>
        <p>The truth is that racing has not had a Triple Crown winner in the 15 years since marketing types came up with the gimmick of a ''challenge'' -- now worth a bonus of $5 million. In fact, the Triple Crown has seen more horses ruined than rewarded, not necessarily anybody's fault, but a reality, nonetheless.</p>
        <p>That big bonus was dangling out there last year when Charismatic, a strapping red-tinged grandson of Secretariat himself barreled out of the chute for the fifth time in 64 days. Less than a mile and a half later, 85,818 fans, the largest crowd in Belmont history, were emitting prayers they did not know they remembered.</p>
        <p>Charismatic broke down in the stretch and was saved only by the gallant acrobatics of Chris Antley, the jockey, who leaped off and stabilized the agonized colt. Modern medical response saved Charismatic's life, but he was the latest casualty in major stakes races that included Union City, who was put down after the 1993 Preakness, and Prairie Bayou, who was destroyed after the 1993 Belmont, Go for Wand in the 1990 Breeders' Cup and Mr. Brooks in the 1992 Breeders' Cup. The historic track at Belmont is still haunted by the death of Ruffian, the noble filly, during an ill-advised match race in 1975.</p>
        <p>Racing manages to get through these tragedies, and most trainers are respectful of their horses. This year Neil Drysdale nursed Fusaichi Pegasus to a Derby victory, and a minor leg injury a week ago gave Drysdale the reason to withdraw Fusaichi Pegasus from the Belmont -- and more power to him.</p>
        <p>''Maybe this is a blessing in disguise,'' Drysdale said. ''The decision whether or not to run him hadn't been made. Well, he made the decision himself.''</p>
        <p>When Frank Stronach, the owner of Red Bullet, did not enter that Preakness winner in the Belmont, there were some cynical suggestions that Stronach was thinking about the money he could make in other major stakes. Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't, but money is not necessarily the best thing for the horses, and does not automatically guarantee glamour, either.</p>
        <p>At any rate, Lukas, who trained Charismatic last year, reminds us that the racing season is a bit more than three races in five weeks. With all due respect to the other two Triple Crown winners, Lukas said that ''I didn't see a Spectacular Bid or Secretariat'' at the Derby and that Red Bullet was ''the horse for the day'' at the Preakness. Lukas also said that the horses would ''sort it out in what you call the second season'' -- meaning everything that happens from here on in.</p>
        <p>That's fine, too. There were no tragedies at the Belmont yesterday, even if there was not the first Triple Crown winner since 1978.</p>
        <p>There must be a reason for the scarcity. Nobody has hit .400 in baseball since Ted Williams batted .406 in 1941, and that's kind of a neat mystique -- like Secretariat's romp in the 1973 Belmont, one of a kind.</p>
        <p>The absence of a Triple Crown candidate did not totally ruin yesterday's crowd, which was 67,810 in 95-degree weather. Even in the general decline of racing, there are still fans who recognize there is more to racing than a Triple Crown.</p>
        <p>The owners still have to wrestle with the possibility that three races within five weeks is too much. Raising the stakes drastically could be dangerous to the four-legged stars of this industry.</p>
