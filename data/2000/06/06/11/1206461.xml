        <p>There is the well-known sociological phe nomenon known as Nimby  not in my backyard. But in this era of otherwise conspicuous prosperity, this is a tale of a lesser-known impulse -- not on your front lawn.</p>
        <p>We're not talking flamingos or jockeys.</p>
        <p>The residents of this affluent Essex County town have been so busy primping that an increasing number of properties have their lawns adorned with signs of painters, plasterers, contractors and other foot soldiers in the war of suburban beautification.</p>
        <p>So in the spirit of Lady Bird Johnson, who a generation ago took it upon herself to rid the nation's highways of billboards, the township committee in this tony enclave -- where million-dollar homes are commonplace, particularly in the Short Hills section -- was expected this week to vote on an ordinance that would ban contractors and others from placing advertising signs on homeowners' lawns.</p>
        <p>''It's just free advertising for the contractor, and most people prefer not to see it,'' Thomas McDermott of the township committee said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>The neighboring town of Summit has a similar ban.</p>
        <p>The township's affluence -- swelled by the region's protracted prosperity -- has in this case become a liability, Mr. McDermott's contention goes, since the number of lawn signs has multiplied amid an explosion of home renovations and additions. And because of the elaborate nature of some of the renovations, Mr. McDermott said, signs can languish on lawns for a year or more.</p>
        <p>''This is a town that has traditionally been free and clear of advertising signs,'' he said. ''But in recent years there's been an incredible increase. On every third or fourth house, you see a sign for a contractor, sprinkler system, painter, dog walker, you name it.''</p>
        <p>The ordinance would exempt sale signs, which are protected under the First Amendment, although signs announcing pending sales or properties sold would be banned on the ground that they are advertisements.</p>
        <p>Home security systems signs would also be exempt under the proposal because they are intended to discourage potential intruders.</p>
        <p>Of course, the craftsmen who have concurrently ridden the wave of prosperity are disturbed by the township's intentions. And in a place where the main shopping street -- Millburn Avenue -- is dotted with vacant storefronts, the swipe at businesses has some perplexed.</p>
        <p>''This could definitely mean a rise in prices,'' said 29-year-old Kevin Sheridan of Maplewood, the owner of Rutgers Painting, which does about 20 percent of its business in Millburn.</p>
        <p>His company grew slowly in its first four years, Mr. Sheridan said, but it doubled every year in the next four years, once he started putting up advertising signs on customers' lawns.</p>
        <p>If he has to resort to more costly advertising methods to keep business coming in, he says he will be forced to pass along those added costs to customers.</p>
        <p>''It could mean a drastic reduction in calls to us,'' said Mr. Sheridan. ''It could take away half my business there.''</p>
        <p>He also contended that having a sign at each workplace made businesses more accountable, since the entire neighborhood could see what kind of a job was done and by whom, and made it easier for residents to see what companies were popular.</p>
        <p>''It gives it a human touch,'' Mr. Sheridan said. ''Otherwise, you're just pulling a name out of a phone book.''.</p>
        <p>To counteract that, the Millburn Building Department said it planned to keep a database of contractors' work that would be open to residents -- though no recommendations would be made.</p>
        <p>In the township's opinion, some signs are more equal than others. Although some municipalities restrict the size or placement of advertising signs, Mr. Sheridan noted that politicians rarely worried about restrictions on election ads.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. McDermott confirmed that the township's ban would exempt those types of signs because of first amendment protections.</p>
        <p>But Lenora Lapidus, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, was not buying, saying that commercial speech should benefit from the same protections as campaign material.</p>
        <p>''A town can have ordinances on aesthetics and can place limits on signs to keep things looking nice,'' she said, but added that imposing an all-out ban on commercial signs was not permissible under the Constitution.</p>
