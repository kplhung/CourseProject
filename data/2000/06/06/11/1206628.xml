        <p>William R Andersen letter on Harold Bloom's June 4 article on e-books holds there are myriad ways to deliver writer's art and some have enormous advantage over others</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Harold Bloom's disappointment with electronic text readers was predictable. If you take a fellow who has so resisted technology that he doesn't use a keyboard and then give him a very limited electronic reader which doesn't allow one to adjust line length or font size (and which requires a button push to ''turn'' a page) and then give him a book he really doesn't like, it is not surprising that he will be disappointed.</p>

        <p>Harold Bloom's disappointment with electronic text readers was predictable.

        <p>As with books recorded on tape, books serialized in newspapers or books read by grandmothers, there are many ways of delivering a writer's art, and depending on the circumstances, some have enormous advantages over others. The next time you fly, get a decent reader, put into it several of your technical manuals, a novel or two, Daniel J. Boorstin's recent history of thought, a volume of poetry and The New York Times Magazine -- all of which fit into a little leather case in a corner of your briefcase. You'll love the flight.</p>
