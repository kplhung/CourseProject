        <p>ON the eastern end of Long Island, this is the month of strawberries, June bugs that buzz against the screen doors like beepers gone haywire, and brides. At this time of year, if you see an enormous number of cars parked outside a house and people running frantically down the driveway, it's either a yard sale or a wedding.</p>
        <p>Summer weddings in Southampton, East Hampton and Montauk have become like the houses there -- more expensive than ever and so big they affect everything from traffic patterns to air quality. Sometimes, there are so many roses on the tables, an entire neighborhood is scented.</p>
        <p>On June 3, a wedding took place in Montauk that was just the opposite, as quiet and unassuming as a yoga class. Elizabeth Lynn Johnson, 26, and Josh Epstein, 25, were married on the beach with 17 barefoot guests watching, mostly immediate family.</p>
        <p>The couple described their wedding as ''aggressively small'' -- the sort of event you might drive by and not even notice, one that was deeply felt by them, not by the whole neighborhood. ''I didn't want to think, 'This is my day, my day, my day,' '' Ms. Johnson said. ''If you act like your wedding day is the greatest moment in your life, it's all downhill from there.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson, an editorial associate for the Talk of the Town department at The New Yorker, also describes herself as aggressively small. She's 4-foot-11 but does not in any way have a petite personality.</p>
        <p>''She's effervescent, always chirpy, excited about anything,'' said Brenda Phipps, one of six friends the couple invited to the wedding. ''She's very much in the know about the Internet, magazines, films. She would never be lost in a conversation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Epstein, a theatrical lighting designer in New York, grew up in Minot, N.D. Friends describe him as resembling his hometown, low-key and humble and never acting like the biggest thing on the map. Ms. Johnson describes him this way: ''Josh is a very unique man. He's a designer, so he cares about china patterns, but he's a rabid Yankee fan who can go on and on about baseball stats, players and history. He is the chef in our household. And, he has his private pilot's license.''</p>
        <p>The couple's love story was quiet and free of fireworks. They met as undergraduates at the University of Chicago, and were friends for a long time. Then one day they went to a campus party together, and he put his arm into a bucketful of ice to fish out a beer for her. As his arm reddened from the cold, she remembered wondering to herself if he might be developing a crush on her.</p>
        <p>Not long after, the couple began dating. ''It was like, 'Oh, we can have fun together and be pals and also kiss,' '' she remembered. She added: ''Our relationship has never been fantasy. It's always been realistic and down-to-earth, and yet it's also been beyond my wildest dreams.''</p>
        <p>For their wedding, the couple rented a driftwood-gray oceanfront house decorated only with pictures of themselves as children inside and a hand-painted sign out front, that read ''Beth + Josh.''</p>
        <p>While many Hamptons weddings drown out nature, this one was drowned out by nature. During the civil ceremony on the beach, a violinist played, but the waves were crashing so loudly, the music could barely be heard by guests, let alone neighbors. The couple's vows were nearly inaudible, too. Observing the ceremony was like watching television with the mute on.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the small group of guests sat down for dinner at one table in the house, where each received a one-of-a-kind bride and bridegroom figurine, ranging from a tall and sleek flawless china couple to a kitschy pair on a Pez dispenser.</p>
        <p>''We gave everyone a bride and groom figurine just to acknowledge the fact that there are many other couples and weddings out there,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''We're not special, even though we think our day was the best.''</p>
