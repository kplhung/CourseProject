      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>E-Buzzz, a personal digital assistant currently in development at Thompson Consumer Electronics, is a striking example of how far high-tech applications have come from the days of gray boxy computers and brick-size cell phones. To understand how aesthetic and engineering concerns are resolved in the design of today's consumer electronics, The Times asked the designer of E-Buzzz to describe what decisions went into each of this creature's many functions.</p>
        <p>CONCEPT  We started brainstorming. The target group was students, probably 8 to 28. I wanted something that was more price-friendly -- hopefully under $99 -- and would still have a bit of flair to it.</p>
        <p>ANTENNAE  They're the ''look cool'' part. As this product was being developed and it took on this whole bug/beetle appearance, the antennae really helped put the period on the sentence. But they're actually quick-function buttons -- quick-menu switches so you can scroll up and down. And you can also customize them, depending on whether you're left-handed or right-handed.</p>
        <p>STYLUS  You could actually touch the interactive screen with your finger. But with the stylus, first of all, you don't have the smear factor, and second, you can be more accurate. And it has a small L.E.D. inside, almost like a flashlight. I was really having a hard time deciding where to put it. Then someone suggested a little storage area in the hinge. It's spring-loaded: if you push on the orange spot, the stylus will spring out.</p>
        <p>SCREEN  We wanted the entire device to fold over, but the collapsible screen gave me the most trouble. Our first prototype, with an oval screen with plexiglass, collapsed too much and would tear at the seams. I was inspired by some shamrock shapes I saw in a book, and I developed a design for that, with clear plexiglass that's thin and pliable. The shamrock shape turned out to work beneficially: when it folds over it won't tear.</p>
        <p>OVERALL SHAPE  It started out looking more like a PalmPilot, with a little more contour to the bottom, like a shirt pocket. The design staff thought we could probably push it further. I wanted to have some switches at the top, but then it started looking like an owl with ears. So I added a little interest to the shape of the screen. I was really inspired by shapes of insects like beetles that have a hard protective shell. This has real sensitive electronics inside, so I thought: beetle, hard shell -- it would be a good progression. And the color is green metallic -- again I was just going from actual insects -- with off-white, orange and black to help define the legs and appendages. Maybe the next generation will have a changeable shell panel so you could interchange colors.</p>
        <p>MODE BUTTON  Early on I was thinking it would be nice to have some switches on the shell itself, but they would break easily, and I didn't want it to be too confusing. So I tried to do as much as I could onscreen. You can customize it to your liking. There's a pager, a way to dial 911, a list and a section for games. Or you could customize it to get to the Internet quicker or to other parts of the menus. The mode button in the middle is like a miniature mouse. And if you hold down the button for a sustained amount of time it releases a shrill alarm sound, in case of emergency.</p>
        <p>HINGE  There's a new material called electrically charged nanoporous material. If enough electricity runs through it, the E-Buzzz springs open or shuts closed -- almost how our muscles contract and relax. It's a living hinge, they call it. It's wild stuff. So you push a switch or you get e-mail and the beetle will spring open. It's just that little added surprise.</p>
