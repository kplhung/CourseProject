        <p>It's the day before Christmas, I'm in the middle of my holiday shopping and I'm parched. Looking down at my hand-held mallbot, I notice that McDonald's is offering 16 ounces of Diet Coke at 89 cents, but my bot, whom I call Marty, would fry his silicon if I paid retail. He's a little Palm Pilot-looking gizmo and he can keep track of the price fluctuations of every item in the mall through his little infrared window, and he can haggle them down if I let him. He signals that Diet Rite has tumbled to about two pennies an ounce over at Subway. That means that the teenagers who work as food-court arbitrageurs will be selling Diet Rite to the people in the McDonald's line. I figure Mickey D.'s is going to have to discount deep at the register, so I put in an offer for 63 cents a cup and let the market come to me. I could hold out until after the lunch rush, when prices usually drop 15 percent, but I'm thirsty now. Besides, I want to be back at Macy's in half an hour. It has been oversupplied with my favorite brand of cologne all day, and with the Christmas shopping season over in just a few hours, there are signs of panic sweeping across the store's entire male-fragrance sector.</p>
        <p>It could happen. These days, we think of prices at the mall as if they were pretty much static. The stores print them out in black ink on cardboard, hang them around the items with plastic string. Sometimes they'll chip off 25 percent or so and call it a sale. But why should the price of a Gap sweater at the mall be more stable than the price of the Gap company on the stock exchange? Apply Wall Street information technology to the retail sector and pretty soon you've got a pricing revolution.</p>

Apply Wall Street information technology to the retail sector and pretty soon you've got a pricing revolution.</p>
        <p>Online trading has already made prices more dynamic. Prices for Beanie Babies fluctuate giddily on eBay. Across the Web there are auction sites beyond comprehension; a few weeks ago you could have gone on bid4assets.com, where bankruptcy and foreclosed assets are for sale, and made a serious play for the patent rights to the ''Bone Chiller'' -- a tray that makes ice in the shape of dog bones, inscribed with phrases like ''Dogs Love Ice.'' These sites bring people together and loosen up prices, and they are just the beginning. Today, person-to-person sales dominate the online auction world, but within two years, analysts say, merchant-to-person auctions will take over.</p>
        <p>Auction portals like biddersedge.com will draw up charts tracing the price fluctuations of, say, stereo systems, and there will even be opportunities for auction formats like reverse auctions, in which the more people bid, the more the price goes down as consumers take advantage of economies of scale. But the problem with auctions is that they have a distinct starting and closing time. At NexTag.com, which bills itself as ''the stock exchange for anything but stocks,'' there is no preset closing time. On everything from computers to books and CD's, bidders can continually change their bids and suppliers can counterbid, which produces a continuous round of haggling until both sides are happy. That brings us close to a Wall Street model for retail goods.</p>
        <p>Pretty soon, prices will move so fast, mere humans won't be able to keep up, so we'll have digital shopping agents like Marty to buy stuff for us. I called up Charles R. Plott, a professor at the California Institute of Technology, and from his cell phone he led me to a site where I could take part in a simulated auction for F.C.C. licenses. When I selected an odd package of licenses, the computer told me how much to bid, and hooked me up with people I didn't know so we could bid as a team. Such agents are getting better and better at haggling, the way Deep Blue keeps getting better at playing chess. ''They're becoming ever more autonomous,'' says Jeff Kephart, an I.B.M. researcher. ''We're creating these agents that will exist in the economy with us.''</p>
        <p>This could change everything about the information age, which has, so far, been dominated by socially awkward, pallid-skinned people who have nothing better to do than spend hours in front of a computer screen. These guys will be drawn to dynamic pricing like moths to a flame. They'll spend hours gaming out their next purchase of dandruff shampoo. But they'll be utterly decimated by the shopping agents! In the simulations so far, the shopping agents produce profound price swings -- what the experts call ''roller-coaster pricing'' -- as they instantaneously respond to conditions. The agents will be so fast and they will haggle so well, no human will be able to keep up, no matter how geeky.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, those of us who know how bad we are at negotiating things will just send out our Marty-type shopping agents to do our deal making. For all of human history, people like us have been getting suckered in the marketplace. But now, thanks to technology, we will finally get the bargains we deserve.</p>
