        <p>In a joint effort to use the power of the Internet, 13 large commercial property companies have agreed to form an organization called the Office Technology Consortium. The companies, which own or manage over 400 million square feet of space, say they want to use the scale of their operations as well as Internet technologies to improve business processes and industry service standards.</p>
        <p>The first effort by the consortium will be an online purchasing program called the Landlord Procurement Exchange, which is designed to lower operating costs by more efficiently finding needed goods and services and then using the buying power of the group to negotiate discounts. Sometime thereafter the consortium will develop an online Leasing Exchange, described as an undertaking ''that will enable customers to make faster, more informed decisions regarding leasing of office space.''</p>
