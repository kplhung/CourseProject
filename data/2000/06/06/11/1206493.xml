        <p>THINK Maria Callas, ascending to the pinnacle of fame and fashion, her every calculated scene, on or offstage, a photo-op. Then came the fatal descent of her career and of her life. Tosca, in her death leap from a parapet atop the Castel Sant'Angelo, is a symbol of the Callas impulse to self-destruct.</p>
        <p>A notorious life, a fabulous career, both wildly troubled, both wastefully cut short. All that and her instinctive largesse, the grand manner defined, are the stuff of legend. Her wrong notes are painfully documented on bountiful recordings. Her glamour shots, attesting to the art of reinvention, collected in pricey volumes, adorn coffee tables and bookshelves.</p>
        <p>Now think Leslie Uggams, literally a Broadway baby, and a down-home star later on. Married 35 years, mother of two and already five years older than Callas when she died a recluse, some say, of a broken heart.</p>
        <p>Ms. Uggams is the archetypal show business survivor in the role of a superstar who could not survive, a testament to the affirmation of life playing a desperate woman with what Ms. Uggams is certain was a ''death wish.''</p>
        <p>A 1968 Tony winner (''Hallelujah, Baby!''), a television celebrity, from ''Sing Along With Mitch'' (1960) to ''Roots'' (1977) and a headliner in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. Ms. Uggams segues smoothly from musical to nonmusical roles.</p>
        <p>New Jersey's professional theaters have showcased three such recent displays of doing it all: Irving Berlin's ''Call Me Madam'' (Paper Mill in Millburn,) Duke Ellington's ''Play On!''(Crossroads in New Brunswick) and currently Terrence McNally's ''Master Class'' (TheaterFest in Montclair, from Thursday through June 25.) That's the Callas part, and it's a nonmusical role all about music.</p>
        <p>Why is Ms. Uggams TheaterFest's Callas of choice? Are not her happy, settled life, her image of pizazz and glitter, and still gleaming soprano, not to mention race, antithetical to Callas, whose credo was ''suffer in silence,'' and whose voice, even in its prime, hardly gleamed? Here is a case example of non-type as well as nontraditional casting.</p>
        <p>The question of whether Ms. Uggams can make the leap from Broadway, the blues and the big brass band to bel canto is irrelevant. In Mr. McNally's distillation of a series of actual master classes Callas conducted at Juilliard in 1971, the singing voice is frayed. ''I hope you're not expecting me to sing,'' she announces.</p>
        <p>''This is like jumping off a bridge and hoping there is a net beneath me,'' she said, perhaps unconsciously evoking the memory of the Callas Tosca. Not that Ms. Uggams has Callas memories. But she has been doing total immersion, in tapes and videos and all manner of research.</p>
        <p>Like Callas, ''I'm going for the drama,'' Ms. Uggams said before a recent rehearsal. ''Besides, opera is a metaphor here. It's icing on the cake if you know it, but a master class is a master class if the master is a taskmaster.'' She was alluding to Stella Adler in whose acting conservatory Ms. Uggams enrolled for two years -- after winning the Tony.</p>
        <p>''She could be extraordinarily humiliating if you were off base, if you didn't know your stuff,'' Ms. Uggams said of Miss Adler. ''And she could make you shrink 10 inches.'' Like Mr. McNally's Callas does to two of her three onstage students.</p>
        <p>Ms. Uggams was touched by opera at an early age. Her Aunt Eloise appeared in many a ''Porgy and Bess'' revivals, and 1953 was a memorable year. Leontyne Price was Broadway's Bess then and ''I was one of her backstage babies,'' Ms. Uggams recalled.</p>
        <p>Of course, the child was a backstage fixture, and a veteran one at that. What do you expect from a trouper who, at the age of 8, warmed up audiences for Dinah Washington and Louis Armstrong at the Apollo in Harlem?</p>
        <p>Instead of avoiding the black actor issue, Ms. Uggams brings it up, having written many newspaper articles about limited opportunities, especially for black women. She knows that her fame promotes color-blindness in producers, ''but only in theater, and where are the visionary ones?'' she said. ''After 'Roots,' I thought we were making progress, but nothing took off for African-American women,'' she said. ''What's the answer? We'd all like to know.''</p>
        <p>''I don't want to think about it,'' she said, reverting to ''Master Class'' and its attendant intimidations. But she was thinking way back to Armstrong's advice (''Always work those chops'') and to Washington's imploration at the Apollo. (''You must always be a lady.'') The words of those old masters still come in handy.</p>
        <p>And how they blend right into the lines she is learning. ''Corragio,'' Callas orders. ''Sing for your supper. Sing for your salvation. Try isn't good enough. Do!''</p>
        <p>MASTER CLASS</p>
        <p>TheaterFest, Montclair State University, Valley Road and Normal Avenue, Upper Montclair.  Through June 25. Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.; next Sunday at 3 p.m.  (973) 655-5112.</p>
