        <p>IN the 19th century, when Long Branch was the first seaside resort in America, Winslow Homer painted seascapes there. In the 1950's, a boy whose family spent summers in the enclave of Elberon in Long Branch found his calling as an underwater photographer.</p>
        <p>It started the day 12-year-old David Doubilet padded out in flippers, past the ladies playing mah-jongg at the beach club, with a snorkel and an underwater camera he had made from a Brownie Hawkeye and some oxygen bags his father, an anesthesiologist, had given him.</p>
        <p>For the last 30 years, from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, from the Southwest Pacific to the waters off Japan, Mr. Doubilet has captured a world of bejeweled ocean creatures playing on sandy stages: an emerald stingray shadowing a ship in the Bahamas; a golden big-bellied sea horse grazing in a Tasmanian sea. He has published 50 articles in National Geographic; his photos have appeared on 12 covers. He has authored five books of photography, including ''Water Light Time'' (Phaidon, 1999), which won the Antibes Festival prize for best underwater images in a book. In April, his photograph of the jagged jaw of a great white shark loomed on the National Geographic cover. This month his photos of jellyfish, including a hairy-looking 7-foot jellyfish from New Jersey, are in the magazine.</p>
        <p>''In my judgment, he is the finest, most complete underwater still photographer (he doesn't shoot movies) of our time,'' Peter Benchley, the author of ''Jaws,'' wrote in the cover story for the April issue of National Geographic. Mr. Benchley and Mr. Doubilet have collaborated on several projects in the last 20 years, including a hunt for the great white shark, which was televised on ''National Geographic Explorer.'' For years, Mr. Doubilet, 54, had been hoping for a photograph that would express the creature's ''absolute sharkness.'' As the April cover shows, he found it.</p>
        <p>At his house in Elberon, which is now home base, Mr. Doubilet displays a 7-inch shark's tooth. ''I'm really not too afraid of a lot of things in the ocean,'' he said. ''There are a lot of things on land I despise, like spiders and snakes. I think I'd get very scared around a crocodile. They are the most frightening things in the world. They have the speed and the power of sharks. Even a small one can give you a go, as they say in Australia.''</p>
        <p>One expects Mr. Doubilet to be walking around the house in wet suit and flippers, but he is in standard journalistic khaki. Seated on the couch, his beloved antique Morse diving helmet peering over his shoulder from a table, his famous photograph ''Circle of Barracudas'' on the wall, and the air a little damp, Mr. Doubilet, who is on or under the ocean more than he is on land, takes a deep breath.</p>
        <p>What comes out is a singular perspective, rather like an astronaut's. ''What I really objected to in a lot of the summing up of the millennium and the last hundred years is that no one talked about the invention of the Aqualung,'' Mr. Doubilet said. ''It opened up the sea to the world. Before then, we looked out at the gray water and breaking waves and had no concept of what was underneath.''</p>
        <p>Capturing the magic of that world has been the challenge. ''Light and water are a very strange mixture of physics on earth,'' he said. ''In the first 3 feet, even in the clearest water, 90 percent of the spectrum is absorbed. So light comes into the sea like a blanket, softly or in shafts. You look back up at the surface. You see how light silhouettes an object. It is the most astounding moment of light in the world. You're looking at the poetry of physics.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Doubilet is critical of explorers who bring back unimaginative images. ''It was the single biggest failure of the space program,'' he said. ''We would be standing on the Moon right now. We could have sent poets, writers, God forbid, a photographer. I've seen a lot of it, and except for the pictures of the Earth, they are not a whole lot better than the average family vacation in the Grand Canyon pictures. The only difference is the cost. And we paid the price. We haven't gone back there.''</p>
        <p>Not that Mr. Doubilet wants to go to the Moon. He has other things to do: find out where the oar fish come from, look at coral spawning, photograph shipwrecks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doubilet has the ability to think on his fins, shoot the picture, carry the history of photography in his head and come back, bitten and stung, with the story.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doubilet was a professional photographer before he went to college. At 17 he was the laboratory photographer at the Sandy Hook Marine Sciences Laboratory in Sandy Hook. In 1971, one year after graduating from college he shot his first story for National Geographic.</p>
        <p>''Other photographers will go for the action shots,'' said Robert Sterner, publisher of Immersed, a diving magazine based in New Jersey. ''But he's telling stories with his pictures. He's revealing something about life.''</p>
