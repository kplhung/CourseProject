        <p>Alan Robbins letter on Harold Bloom's June 4 article on paper books and computer-generated books holds some books were meant to be heard or read from handwritten manuscriptsï¿½</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Harold Bloom's dinosauring advance against computer screens derails when he switches from the tiny experience of reading Crichton on a Pocket PC to a grander rave against on-screen reading. It is one thing to wax poetic about books, another to presume that nothing beyond a book can deliver a personal literary experience. The contract between author and reader is never final but fluid, always renegotiated at every new round of technology. In fact, reading Shakespeare in book form is just such a negotiation, since the work was penned to be heard not seen. And encountering Austen on a screen is a mere sidestep from the book, compared with the loss of ''achieved otherness'' when her personal, handwritten manuscripts were turned into cold, hard, typeset books.</p>

        <p>Mr. Bloom does not lament those changes because they are not his. Like most Luddites, he is most interested in fixing the world at the moment of his own empowerment through his own generation's technology.</p>
