        <p>THE ranks of the great film directors are short on Keatses and Shelleys, young artists cut off in their prime, leaving behind a handful of great works that suggest what might have been. But one who qualifies is Jean Vigo, the French director who died of tuberculosis at age 29 in 1934. Vigo completed just four films (two of them brief, avant-garde documentaries) before his death, but his two dramatic features, ''Zero de Conduite'' (1933) and ''L'Atalante'' (1934) possess an originality and a depth of emotion that have earned him a well-deserved spot in the pantheon.</p>
        <p>''L'Atalante,'' which plays for a week at Film Forum beginning Friday, is a fixture in surveys of the best films of the 20th century; but it's also a film that's been misrepresented by scholarly critics, who either deconstruct it to the point of sterility or build it up so much that first-time viewers walk away disappointed.</p>
        <p>While the film is certainly a great one, it's basically a piece of romantic fluff -- albeit intoxicating and often incandescent fluff.</p>
        <p>''L'Atalante'' tells the story of Juliette (Dita Parlo), a young woman from the provinces who marries Jean (Jean Daste), the captain of the barge from which the film takes its name, and leaves her small-town life for an unpredictable existence on the rivers and canals of France. Her marriage to Jean turns into an oddball triangle of sorts when she befriends the barge's chief porter, a tattooed curmudgeon called Pere Jules (Michel Simon, who played the title character in Jean Renoir's classic comedy ''Boudu Saved From Drowning'' and appeared as an inquisitor in Carl Theodor Dreyer's ''The Passion of Joan of Arc''). Eventually, Juliette leaves them both for the lights of Paris, only to discover that city life, like life on the river, cannot live up to her fantasies. But just as the film turns melancholy, fate intervenes to ensure a happy ending.</p>
        <p>What makes the film so special is the giddy sense it provides of life's infinite possibilities, courtesy of a series of out-of-left-field reversals that change the story's direction at regular intervals. When Juliette first boards the barge, for example, she's a little hesitant about her new life.</p>
        <p>Then, in the film's most beautiful sequence, she climbs onto the roof of the barge at twilight and is dumbstruck by the beauty of the passing scenery. Intoxicated by the freedom she's suddenly realized barge life provides -- and by a resulting increase in her love for Jean -- she returns to her cabin a changed woman. Although the background scenery was inserted by rear-projection methods that seem a little crude by modern standards, the sequence is still a remarkable showcase for the gifts of the cinematographer, Boris Kaufman, and the composer, Maurice Jaubert, whose contributions were woven together by Vigo in a manner far ahead of the film's time. In another memorable sequence, the gruff Pere Jules, who doesn't take too well to the notion of a woman on board, seems about to choke Juliette when she asks him to model the skirt she's altering. Against all odds, he's charmed by her request, and the two become fast friends.</p>
        <p>The playfulness of many of these scenes evokes the films of Charles Chaplin; but while Chaplin demonized technology in the 1936 ''Modern Times'' (as did Rene Clair, one of Vigo's idols and chief influences, in his 1931 satire ''A Nous la Liberte''), Vigo celebrates it as a force akin to magic. Juliette is completely mesmerized by the barge's onboard radio, and there are several hilarious bits involving Pere Jules and a phonograph. Most magical of all is the climax, in which a proto-jukebox playing an ode to barge life that Pere Jules sang earlier in the film becomes the deus ex machina that enables everyone to live happily ever after. It's these scenes that link Vigo's work to that of his most obvious heir, Jacques Demy, the director of the great bittersweet 60's musicals ''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'' and ''The Young Girls of Rochefort.''</p>
        <p>Although ''L'Atalante'' is nothing if not accessible, the film was deemed an unreleasable mess by its distributors, who trimmed it by 24 minutes and retitled it ''La Chaland Qui Passe'' (''The Passing Barge''), after a popular song of the day that was also grafted onto the soundtrack without Vigo's consent. His reputation may have prompted the interference: in 1933, Vigo's ''Zero de Conduite,'' an autobiographical film about young boys at boarding school, had been banned by French censors as subversive.</p>
        <p>''L'Atalante'' was less personal for Vigo. It was essentially an assignment for the producer Jacques-Louis Nounez, who thought a conventional romance might help Vigo enter the mainstream of French cinema -- and who didn't expect such poetic results. Vigo approved a few cuts suggested by Nounez, but he was too ill to protest the gutting of the film by its distributor and died just days after it left Parisian theaters.</p>
        <p>ALTHOUGH the film was bowdlerized, it quickly struck a chord with cinephiles who became convinced that a masterpiece would emerge if the film could be seen as Vigo had intended. In 1935, Andre Thirifays, the president of a Brussels film society, restored some of the missing footage for a one-time-only screening, and another partially restored version briefly circulated in 1940. Yet another attempt at recreating Vigo's intended version of the film was made in 1950, but it wasn't until 1989 that Gaumont -- the company that had cut the film to ribbons in 1934 -- set things straight, bankrolling a complete restoration, including a shot missing from all previous versions in which Pere Jules cheekily ''smokes'' a cigarette through his belly button. It's this version, which had its American premiere at the New York Film Festival in 1990, that is being presented at Film Forum.</p>
        <p>While Vigo achieved immortality through his films, he failed to realize his other goal -- clearing the name of his father, Eugene Bonaventure de Vigo, a colorful anarchist who changed his name to Miguel Almereyda as a political gesture. The editor of a radical newspaper called Le Bonnet Rouge (The Red Cap), Almereyda was imprisoned in 1917 on suspicion of receiving payments from the German government during World War I, and was killed in prison, strangled to death by a fellow prisoner using a pair of shoelaces that the 12-year-old Jean had purchased for his father just before his arrest.</p>
        <p>Since Vigo's mother was unable to support him, the frail lad went to his uncle and spent his childhood and early adult years in boarding schools and sanatoriums, where he took ''rest cures'' right out of Thomas Mann's ''Magic Mountain.'' The shadow of the scandal involving Vigo's father lingered over the director his whole life and his reputation in the years after World War II. Today, Miguel Almereyda and the question of whether he sold out his homeland is little more than a footnote, while the artistic heritage of his son lives on.</p>
