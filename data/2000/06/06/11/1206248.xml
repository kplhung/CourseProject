        <p>Dressing Up</p>
        <p>for the Carnival</p>
        <p>By Carol Shields.</p>
        <p>210 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Viking. $23.95.</p>
        <p>NEARLY three-quarters of the way through this collection of 22 short stories by the author who won just about every prize in sight for her 1994 novel, ''The Stone Diaries,'' there is a sentence that calls out to be quoted, since it seems to be the perfect description of the book as a whole. But by that time, Carol Shields has revealed herself to be such a witty, mercurial, playful writer, such a devious literary chameleon, that the reader may suspect a trap. Could it be that this all-too-perfect line is dangling there, just ripe for plucking, to see who will tumble and quote it? Might it even be a parody of something someone has already observed about Shields's work? It says a lot about the sheer, sometimes perverse fun in this book that such questions come to mind. (The word ''carnival,'' after all, does not appear in the title by chance.) But for whatever reason, the sentence is there: ''The ordinary has become extraordinary.''</p>
        <p>Much of the time, ''Dressing Up for the Carnival'' is a raucous celebration of the hidden qualities lurking within utterly ordinary items -- a six-cup coffeepot, keys, a silk scarf, a straw hat, mirrors, a window, even a computer keyboard. The narrator of a story about three unrelated women (one from the 19th century) who choose not to die for love says of one of them, a would-be suicide: ''She is a woman whose life is crowded with not-unpleasant errands and with the entrapment of fragrant, familiar and sometimes enchanting items, all of which possess a reassuring, measurable weight and volume. Not that this is much of a handrail to hang on to -- she knows that, and so do I -- but it is at least continuous, solid, reliable as a narrative in its turnings and better than no handrail at all.''</p>
        <p>Shields's stories rarely tell a single tidy tale. Instead, they tend to be quirky catalogs in which a good deal of the appeal derives from the surprising ways in which one item is linked to the next. ''Keys,'' for example, begins with an arresting line: ''Biff Monkhouse, the man who brought bebop to Europe, collapsed and died last week in the lobby of the George V Hotel in Paris.'' But after a few brief paragraphs, we hear no more about Monkhouse; the focus shifts to the one thing the dead man had in his possession, a key ring. And we're off. We hear about a college professor and her theories about keys, about the three keys her 66-year-old mother keeps, about the key to a burned-down boathouse her lover still carries, about the key kept in his back pocket by a 16-year-old who was near the boathouse when it mysteriously burned, about a woman who finds that same key in a Laundromat dryer and later tosses it away, about a Buffalo millionaire and some of the keys he collected for his key museum and finally about a boy who visits the museum wearing the key to his house on a string around his neck. Each step along this route is a surprise, and each character is a memorable creation whose keys unlock more than anyone may suspect.</p>
        <p>The importance of seemingly unimportant things is a consistent theme throughout the collection. Yet sometimes it is the lack of things that makes all the difference. The title story deals with the clothes a random group of people put on in the morning to help them get through the day. But the final story is about not wearing clothes at all. (Grandfather was a nudist.) Another story features an artist who bricks up all the windows in his house and studio to avoid a new window tax. Elsewhere, it is the loss of a scarf (theft, in effect) that is more important than the long, detailed business of buying it.</p>
        <p>The most inventive of the stories about loss concerns a writer who sits down at her temperamental word processor and discovers that she no longer has the ability to use a certain unnamed vowel. The story then continues on, skirting around words containing the letter ''I'' as she tries to write on the broken machine. ''Absence'' could simply have been a virtuoso piece. Yet, with all its tricks of avoidance, the story is also a serious meditation on how writers write and readers read.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, not all the ordinary moments in this collection are rendered extraordinary. The book has its clunkers. A few of the shortest stories read like pale creative-writing exercises. Assignment: write a story in which someone is struck by a harp falling from the sky. Assignment: write a parody of an article in a food magazine. And there is a heavy-handed sendup of academic backbiting that might, with careful editing, be better suited for publication in a faculty newsletter.</p>
        <p>But these weaker entries were probably included for variety's sake, and variety of setting, tone, sensibility and subject is indeed one of the book's most obvious qualities. ''Dressing Up for the Carnival'' is a glittering sample case of a writer at work. Among its strengths is the easy-to-take comedy in a story like ''Reportage,'' in which townspeople in Manitoba talk about what the discovery of a nearby Roman arena is going to do for the local economy. In ''Invention,'' the news that the narrator's grandmother invented the steering-wheel cover is matched with sly anecdotes about how earlier ancestors invented the hyphen (in 16th-century England) and daydreaming (in ancient Greece).</p>
        <p>THERE are also several stories that focus on resourceful women making the best of difficult situations: ''Edith-Esther,'' in which an 80-year-old novelist matches wits over the telephone with her young and ambitious biographer, or ''Eros,'' in which a divorced woman copes with a sexual advance at an altogether proper dinner party while remembering earlier, perhaps more pleasant moments of erotic awareness. In ''The Next Best Kiss,'' a woman who always seems to be involved with men who can't shut up finds herself dreaming about the strong, silent types in the movies of the 1940's and writes a book entitled ''Matthew Hooke: Silent Visionary.''</p>
        <p>Throughout ''Dressing Up for the Carnival,'' Shields is ready and all too willing to pull the rug out from under her readers. ''New Music,'' one of the collection's most understated stories, may seem at first to be about a woman who becomes Thomas Tallis's biographer because he was the second-best English composer of his age. But it isn't. A sound rule of thumb with a Carol Shields story is that if, halfway through, you think you know what you've got into, you're probably all wrong.</p>
