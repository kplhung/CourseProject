        <p>Rep Matthew G Martinez, Democrat from California's San Gabriel Valley, has voted with Democrats on party-line issues only about 20 percent of time since he lost March 7 primary to State Sen Hilda Solis (S)</p>

        <p>When Representative Matthew G. Martinez, a Democrat from California's San Gabriel Valley, announced this year that he would seek a 10th term, he anticipated, as always, that his biggest fight would be in the primary. His Congressional district, the 31st, is heavily Democratic.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Martinez did not anticipate was that his leading supporters in past primaries, the State Democratic Party and the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, would abandon him and side with State Senator Hilda Solis, maintaining that she was more in tune with the district's voters and their needs.</p>

        <p>When Representative Matthew G. Martinez, a Democrat from California's San Gabriel Valley, announced this year that he would seek a 10th term, he anticipated, as always, that his biggest fight would be in the primary. His Congressional district, the 31st, is heavily Democratic.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Martinez did not anticipate was that his leading supporters in past primaries, the State Democratic Party and the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, would abandon him and side with State Senator Hilda Solis, maintaining that she was more in tune with the district's voters and their needs.</p>
        <p>He lost, beaten better than 2 to 1, the only incumbent in the country to suffer that political ignominy so far this year. Come the fall, Senator Solis faces no Republican opponent.</p>
        <p>In defeat, Representative Martinez seems to be a changed politician.</p>
        <p>Before the March 7 primary, he was known as a faithful, party-line legislator who voted with his Democratic colleagues more than 90 percent of the time on crucial issues. But since the primary, according to an analysis of his votes by The Los Angeles Times, he has stuck with the Democrats on party-line issues only about 20 percent of the time.</p>
        <p>Why, given that the Democrats, if they hold ranks on a crucial issue, need only a handful of Republican defectors to carry the day?</p>
        <p>He's not saying.</p>
