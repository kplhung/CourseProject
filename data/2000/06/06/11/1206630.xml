        <p>IS the trouble with using an A.T.M. that the 40 seconds it takes for a typical transaction are so boring? Wouldn't that time -- two-thirds of an entire minute -- be more useful if you could catch up on the world or on popular culture, check a stock price or do anything but just stand there as life slips through the hourglass?</p>
        <p>For those who want to multitask during every available millisecond, Robert A. Chlebowski, executive vice president of distribution strategy for Wells Fargo Bank of San Francisco, has helped create an answer. The bank is rolling out A.T.M.'s that will play quick movie trailers before a transaction, then offer headlines and stock quotations from MSNBC while you wait for your money. Someday, the machines may allow some Web surfing, too.</p>

        <p>IS the trouble with using an A.T.M. that the 40 seconds it takes for a typical transaction are so boring? Wouldn't that time -- two-thirds of an entire minute -- be more useful if you could catch up on the world or on popular culture, check a stock price or do anything but just stand there as life slips through the hourglass?</p>
        <p>For those who want to multitask during every available millisecond, Robert A. Chlebowski, executive vice president of distribution strategy for Wells Fargo Bank of San Francisco, has helped create an answer. The bank is rolling out A.T.M.'s that will play quick movie trailers before a transaction, then offer headlines and stock quotations from MSNBC while you wait for your money. Someday, the machines may allow some Web surfing, too.</p>
        <p>In addition to offering on-board entertainment, of course, the machines will continue to dole out cash, accept deposits and perform other bank functions. ''We'll let people leverage their time,'' Mr. Chlebowski said. ''It'll be like a billboard on the freeway.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chlebowski said tests had shown that the new A.T.M.'s did not cause users to linger, and, in fact, might save time because the underlying technology permits quicker transactions. The company is testing four of the new machines -- three in Northern California and one in Los Angeles. It plans to roll out 800 by the end of this year in California and Arizona and to have 6,500 in 23 states by the end of 2001.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Mr. Chlebowski said, users will be able to personalize their A.T.M. headlines and stock quotations. Now, if the bank can only find a way to permit A.T.M.-based day trading, that 40 seconds will truly become as useful as time spent driving in the fast lane.</p>
