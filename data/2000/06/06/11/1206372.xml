        <p>Atlas, Forever Bronze</p>
        <p>Q.: I've heard that Charles Atlas, the ''World's Most Perfectly Developed Man,'' according to the old advertisements, posed for a number of public statues around the city. Care to name a few?</p>
        <p>A.: Though aspects of Charles Atlas's  biography were clearly embellished by Charles P. Roman, his business partner and creator of the ''97-pound weakling'' ads, Atlas has been linked, at least anecdotally, with several public sculptures.</p>
        <p>One is ''Dawn of Glory,'' a striking World War I memorial at Jamaica Avenue and Cleveland Street in  Highland Park in Brooklyn. Dedicated to the 144 neighborhood servicemen who died in the war, the heroic bronze nude depicts the soul of a slain soldier as he is received into the divine light, American Flag held aloft. Atlas was 32 when he was photographed posing for the sculptor, Pietro Montana, in 1924.</p>

        <p>Atlas, Forever Bronze</p>
        <p>Q.: I've heard that Charles Atlas, the ''World's Most Perfectly Developed Man,'' according to the old advertisements, posed for a number of public statues around the city. Care to name a few?</p>
        <p>A.: Though aspects of Charles Atlas's  biography were clearly embellished by Charles P. Roman, his business partner and creator of the ''97-pound weakling'' ads, Atlas has been linked, at least anecdotally, with several public sculptures.</p>
        <p>One is ''Dawn of Glory,'' a striking World War I memorial at Jamaica Avenue and Cleveland Street in  Highland Park in Brooklyn. Dedicated to the 144 neighborhood servicemen who died in the war, the heroic bronze nude depicts the soul of a slain soldier as he is received into the divine light, American Flag held aloft. Atlas was 32 when he was photographed posing for the sculptor, Pietro Montana, in 1924.</p>
        <p>Atlas is also believed to have posed for Alexander Stirling Calder's statue of George Washington as president, on the west pier of the Washington Arch, around 1917. Why Mr. Atlas's 47-inch chest and 32-inch waist were required to chisel the unimposing figure of a fully clothed middle-aged statesman is open to debate.</p>
        <p>There is anecdotal evidence that the sequoian arms and legs of Mr. Atlas were used by Frederick MacMonnies for the male figure in ''Civic Virtue,'' the infamous allegorical sculpture unveiled outside City Hall in 1922. Known as ''Fat Boy'' or ''Rough Boy'' to its many detractors, it was moved to the Queens Borough Hall in Kew Gardens in 1941.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey C. Hogue, president of Charles Atlas Ltd., maintains that while still a scrawny youth named Angelo Siciliano, Mr. Atlas took a date, Bella Marr, to the beach at Coney Island, where, just as legend has it, a bully kicked sand in their faces. After developing his legendary physique, he borrowed his new name from the gold-painted statue at the Atlas Hotel in Coney Island, Mr. Hogue said. Atlas died in 1972.</p>
        <p>Body of Evidence</p>
        <p>Q.: How long does the medical examiner's office hold an unidentified body before it is sent for burial?</p>
        <p>A.: Four to six weeks, according to Ellen Borakove, the spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office. ''We have a tendency to hold homicides longer,'' she said. ''If the police are still working on it, we'll often try to hold the body until an identification can be made.''</p>
        <p>The process can be harrowing, and time constraints are sometimes ignored. The mutilated body of a 5-year-old girl, found in a picnic cooler by the Henry Hudson Parkway in 1991, was held for more than two years while police searched unsuccessfully for clues to her identity. The girl, whom the police called Baby Hope, was eventually buried, unidentified, at St. Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>New York City's potter's field since 1869 has been on Hart Island in Long Island Sound. Each year about 1,500 burials take place there; about one-tenth of those interred are nameless. ''Before they go to Hart Island, we have a forensic dentist make dental charts, and we photograph and X-ray the body. Plus, the Police Department has the fingerprints,'' Ms. Borakove said. ''This way we can make an identification if the family shows up five or six months later.''</p>
        <p>Cliches in Superlative</p>
        <p>Q.: If New York City police are nicknamed ''New York's finest,'' city firefighters are known as ''New York's bravest'' and city sanitation workers call themselves ''New York's strongest,'' who are ''New York's proudest''?</p>
        <p>A.: Taxi and Limousine Commission inspectors. The expression itself could be called ''New York's stalest.''</p>
