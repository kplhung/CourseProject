        <p>LES CHEIKIN owes his business, in large part, to a 1988 Supreme Court ruling that anything put in the trash in a public area can be taken and read by anyone. The rise in corporate espionage has also been good for his business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheikin owns the Westchester franchise for a company called Shred-It, which sends trucks to businesses and private homes to shred documents, or anything else that must be disposed of securely.</p>
        <p>''The key to our service is obviously security,'' said Mr. Cheikin, a Rye Brook resident who invested more than $300,000 to become the owner of the Shred-It franchise after selling his Manhattan corporate relocation consulting concern two years ago.</p>
        <p>Formerly viewed as a necessity only in Washington, shredders have become commonplace since the Supreme Court ruling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheikin said he serves hospitals, government agencies, businesses, lawyers, doctors, homeowners and others with records they want to keep confidential. He charges between $3.75 and $5 a minute, based on what his workers have to do to remove and shred the documents.</p>
        <p>In the past, many suburban companies would burn confidential documents, but the federal Clean Air Act of 1975 severely curtailed such burning.</p>
        <p>About nine million shredding machines were sold in the United States last year, compared with about 100,000 at the start of the decade, according to industry estimates. The jump, the experts said, was primarily motivated by fears of corporate espionage.</p>
        <p>But industry officials say that many people found individual shredders costly and time-consuming to use, especially when a large number of documents were to be destroyed.</p>
        <p>In the late 1980's, commercial shredders began offering to remove garbage and shred it at warehouses. But after several stories of employees of these companies making copies and selling confidential material, in-house shredding regained favor, industry officials said.</p>
        <p>But the information age has complicated things, as companies began to realize that some of their most confidential data is not even on paper but on computer disks and hard drives, and that it is nearly impossible to destroy such materials on home and office machines, officials said.</p>
        <p>It is now possible to collect thousands of documents on a hard drive, said Greg Brophy, the president and founder of Shred-It, which is based in Toronto. And companies are much more concerned about sending information off site, where they cannot be sure that it has been destroyed. Mr. Brophy sees his company as the answer.</p>
        <p>In large offices, Shred-It sets up locked gray containers to hold materials. Shred-It dispatches trucks equipped with custom-built shredders (measuring 5 feet high, 5 feet wide and 4 feet deep) to dispose of everything from paper documents to computer disks, outdated cosmetics, license plates and remaindered designer dresses. The gray containers are unlocked and dumped into the shredders in the presence of client representatives, company officials said. The documents are shredded in a customer's driveway or parking lot.</p>
        <p>''If you try to shred it yourself, a regular shredder can handle about 30 pounds an hour,'' Mr. Brophy said. ''We are able to do that same amount in about 30 seconds.''</p>
        <p>Company officials said that they ask everyone from homeowners to corporate representatives to watch the documents being destroyed, and then they provide a bill certifying destruction. The company also promises that most of the shredded material, including metals, will be recycled.</p>
        <p>The company's trucks cost a little more than $100,000 each. Each franchise (some are corporate owned) buys its own trucks through Shred-It's national office, which supervises their manufacture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brophy started Shred-it in Ontario in 1987. In the last 13 years, the company has expanded throughout Canada, the United States and nine other countries, including South Africa, Belgium, England, China and Argentina. ''We are the McDonald's of the shredding business,'' Mr. Brophy said.</p>
        <p>Dwarfed by the Shred-It operation in Manhattan, Mr. Cheikin's franchise has three trucks and nine employees, four of whom operate the vehicles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheikin, 57, said he receives about 35 calls from potential clients a week, including about 5 from homeowners who want to dispose of personal information, like A.T.M. receipts, credit card records and tax forms. Mr. Cheikin was born in Westchester and said he jumped at the opportunity to open a franchise in the area.</p>
        <p>After studying the company, Mr. Cheikin said he declined an offer to open the New York City branch and chose Westchester.</p>
        <p>''I could have bought New York City, but I did not want to commute into New York City or run a business in New York City,'' he said. ''It is difficult. They don't make it easy to run a service business there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheikin said his business plan calls for a profit by 2001.</p>
        <p>''We had a lot of business last spring when we had a lot of flooding,'' he said, adding that many customers needed to dispose of water-damaged documents. ''We shred some oddball things, from tax returns to golf bags.''</p>
