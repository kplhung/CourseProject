        <p>RESPONDING to complaints that partisan politics had invaded the County Legislature's press office, Chairman George S. Latimer has instructed staffers to work for both parties.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, Mr. Latimer, a Democrat representing Rye, announced that Gary F. Kriss, the board's communications director since 1988, would work mostly for the board's nine Democrats, and that two new staff members would handle information for the eight Republican members.</p>
        <p>But as he began refusing to work for Republican officials, Mr. Kriss found himself in the middle of a partisan tug of war.</p>
        <p>Katherine S. Carsky, a Yonkers Republican, complained that in recent months, her requests for press releases were delayed or even ''lost.''</p>
        <p>''I wasn't getting any response, and neither were other Republican members,'' she said. ''I stopped requesting them and started writing my own, because it was too time-consuming to follow up.''</p>
        <p>Paul J. Noto, the board's minority leader, who represents Mamaroneck, said he learned in January that Mr. Kriss was telling Republican legislators that he was told not to work for them. Mr. Noto wrote a memo to Mr. Latimer saying that dividing press office services by political party would lead to a ''morale problem'' and ''the kind of partisanship that exists in Albany and Washington.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''That could mean the rapid deterioration of county government. We've never had the press office divided by party affiliation, nor should we.''</p>
        <p>In response, Mr. Latimer wrote a memo last month setting up ground rules, requiring legislators to submit an official form, requesting press assistance, to Mr. Kriss, who would then work on the assignment himself or direct it to a staff member.</p>
        <p>But the board's majority leader, Thomas J. Abinanti, who represents Greenburgh, said that press office staff members should indeed work exclusively for separate political parties. The Democrats, he said, had only agreed that Mr. Kriss would work mostly for them after Republicans legislators hired two press officers solely for themselves. The Republicans, he said, scrapped their plans when they found that the new workers were inexperienced.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Noto said Mr. Kriss was simply playing favorites by working for the board's Democratic leadership, and he also objected to a recent raise in Mr. Kriss's salary, to $114,355 from $105,145.</p>
        <p>''The Democrats get a $114,000-a-year employee to work for them, and we become second-class citizens with $45,000-a-year staffers writing our press releases,'' Mr. Noto said. ''That is unacceptable to the Republican caucus. You don't raise a staffer's pay and decrease his workload. People are shocked to learn that a press guy sits back and types a couple of lines in a press release and  makes six figures.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kriss said he was simply following the Democrats' orders to serve them exclusively. He said he treats both parties as equals but added that ''the majority chair is first among equals.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kriss said his salary reflects the demands of the job, which requires him to take business calls at home after midnight and take a fax machine with him on vacation.</p>
        <p>As for Republicans complaining about losing his services, he said, ''I take that as a compliment.''</p>
        <p>Still some Republican legislators have doubts about Mr. Latimer's effort to resolve the dispute.</p>
        <p>Mr. Noto called Mr. Latimer's memo ''a step in the right direction'' but added that the press office should report weekly on its operations to the Republicans and not just to Mr. Latimer, as the memo directs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Noto said he still opposes giving Mr. Kriss a raise and added: ''We haven't seen, since George put out the memo, a lot of responsiveness from the press office, so certainly time will tell.''</p>
