        <p>IT is surely one of the most thankless tasks in public service. And on Thursday morning, when the gavel pounds for the start of this year's all-day hearing on proposed rent increases for New York City's 1 million rent-stabilized apartments, members of the city's Rent Guidelines Board may well have shudders from hearings past lurking in the recesses of their minds:</p>
        <p>Thoughts of marbles arching at them from the back of the auditorium. Of rainstorms of epithets. Of circling like covered wagons on stage to conduct business while a phalanx of police officers holds the placard-shaking crowd at bay.</p>
        <p>And of all nine board members, those most wondering why on earth they are doing this may well be the five public representatives seated center stage -- landlord members to the right of them, tenants to the left.</p>
        <p>This year, the board has issued a preliminary recommendation that rents on apartments covered by the rent stabilization regulations be raised by 4 percent for one-year leases and 6 percent for two-year leases -- a significant jump from the 2 and 4 percent increases ordered in most recent years.</p>
        <p>Recalling unruly meetings of years past, Vincent Castellano, one of the two landlord members -- who readily affirms that he serves on the board to protect his own interests and those of the city's 25,000 other landlords -- wondered: ''Can you think of any agency of government where the meetings are as bizarre? It's a zoo.''</p>
        <p>As for the public members' motivation, he said, ''They're masochists.''</p>
        <p>David Pagan, one of the two tenant representatives, is the administrator of Los Sures, a housing and community development organization in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. ''I come in from the neighborhoods where I deal with a lot of tenants, that's why I'm here,'' Mr. Pagan said. ''The public members, I don't know. I can't figure what's there for a public member.''</p>
        <p>''There's not much recognition; it's not a power position,'' Mr. Pagan said. ''They really must love to be helpful. At the same time, how long can you be helpful if you are being hit over the head?''</p>
        <p>There is also not much pay; the members receive the same $100-a-day fee that was set back in 1969 when the Rent Guidelines Board was created -- a point of particular annoyance to them. ''We get $100 per session, about 10 times a year,'' Mr. Pagan said. ''So it's an extra thousand dollars, for which we have to reveal our financial history'' -- in a 35-page form.</p>
        <p>To be sure, meetings of the board have been somewhat calmer in recent years. ''Far more decorous than prior years,'' said Mr. Castellano, the landlord representative, ''almost bordering on the civil -- almost, not quite.''</p>
        <p>In part, the relative decorum ''has to do with the economy,'' Mr. Castellano said. ''It's hard to get worked up about a 2 or 4 percent increase when you've got a job. If you're unemployed, it's a different story. It's not the hot-button issue it was in the early 90's.'' Yet, when the board convenes in the Great Hall of Cooper Union, 7 East Seventh Street, at 10 a.m. Thursday, the button may be pushed, a bit.</p>
        <p>For five of the last six years -- not counting tumultuous 1996 when they were 5 and 7 percent -- the rent increases have been 2 percent and 4 percent. And, in the view of tenant advocates, with inflation largely in check, the current proposal for 4 and 6 percent increases seems unjustified.</p>
        <p>The landlords argue, however, that they have been hit with significant increases in fuel costs and real estate taxes, and deserve compensation even greater than the preliminary recommendation.</p>
        <p>The board's final vote will not be taken during the public hearing, but is scheduled for 5 p.m. on June 22, also in the Great Hall at Cooper Union. The final guidelines will affect those leases with starting dates between on Oct. 1, 2000 and Sept. 30, 2001.</p>
        <p>Piqued last month by media accounts that a proposed change in the way the board's staff provides economic reports could lead to whopping increases of 8.5 and 12 percent (in fact, the change was not adopted by the board), public interest in the current proposal has been stirred. And with it, renewed railing on opposing sides of the landlord-tenant divide that (a) the rent board is in the pocket of a city administration beholden to the real estate lobby or (b) that tenant advocates are simply flexing their numbers to politicize the process, invoking protection of the poor on behalf of lots of people who can afford to pay more.</p>
        <p>Central to the board's deliberations is a debate over whether one year's rent guidelines should be based solely on economic factors from the immediately preceding year or should compensate for previous inflationary fluctuations. Also at issue is what role a potentially one-time spike in a particular element of the calculations -- fuel costs, in this instance -- should play.</p>
        <p>All of which sets the stage for 12 hours of vigorous contention on Thursday, with landlord and tenant advocates from the audience taking turns in last-word attempts to test the limits of their allotted three-minute speaking times -- punctuated by vociferous support or derision from opposing factions in the crowd.</p>
        <p>Edward A. Weinstein, for one, will brook little of the disorder of the not-too-distant past. Mr. Weinstein, one of the five public members of the board, is a retired senior partner at the accounting firm of Deloitte &amp; Touche and sits on the boards of six not-for-profit organizations, including the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. At the request of a friend in the city administration (whom he would not name), Mr. Weinstein agreed to serve on the rent board three years ago.</p>
        <p>''Given my background, I'm not quite used to what I've had to endure from the people who attend the meetings,'' Mr. Weinstein said. ''It's a question of unruliness, and the feeling that they have the absolute right to just yell out.''</p>
        <p>''I don't mind if they applaud or boo or hiss, although it's childish,'' Mr. Weinstein said, ''but they disrupt people who are speaking and scream out their unhappy remarks. It just offends me.''</p>
        <p>Vivid in his recollection is a woman who confronted him at the intermission of a meeting during his first year on the board. ''She started screaming at me that I had never heard of Patrick Henry or the Boston Tea Party,'' Mr. Weinstein said, ''meaning I had no right to stifle their right to dissent. I just walked away.''</p>
        <p>The low moment for Edward S. Hochman came in 1994, the year Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed him to serve as chairman and a public member of the board. That year, the board voted increases of 2 and 4 percent and, after a four-year hiatus, reinstituted what it calls the low-rent supplement -- an extra charge for apartments with rents below a certain level. Tenants call it the ''poor tax.''</p>
        <p>IN 1989, the supplement was $5 for stabilized apartments renting for $325 or less. For the next four years, no supplement was charged. But in 1994 it was restored at $15 for apartments renting for $400 or less (This year, the board has proposed a supplement of $15 for rents up to $500).</p>
        <p>''After the final meeting in '94, when it died down,'' Mr. Hochman said, ''I walked to the subway -- the good old City Hall stop for the 4, 5 and 6 trains -- and a couple of people in the crowd followed me and threatened to throw me on the tracks. I remember thinking that's not such a bad idea, an alternative to suicide.''</p>
        <p>During the final meeting in 1996, the one year in the last six in which the increases exceeded 2 and 4 percent, rising to 5 and 7 percent, ''I got hit with marbles, gum and tacks,'' Mr. Hochman, who is a corporate lawyer, said.</p>
        <p>That '96 meeting was probably the stormiest in the board's 31-year history. Kenneth Rosenfeld, director of legal services for the Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation, a tenant rights group, was then one of the two tenant representatives on the rent board. He left the board last year.</p>
        <p>Fully the tenant advocate, Mr. Rosenfeld recalled: ''In that year, there was a temporary increase in fuel costs. And, despite the staff statistics in what is called the Core Price Index, the board ignored its own data and passed what, under those circumstances, were startling and onerous guidelines'' -- the 5 and 7 percent increases.</p>
        <p>''The place was full of people screaming,'' Mr. Rosenfeld said. ''Landlords were yelling, too. We voted on the apartments and the crowd went nuts. In order to continue the meeting, because there were other votes to be taken, we ended up sitting in a circle on the stage at 1 Police Plaza, trying to conduct the rest of the business.''</p>
        <p>IF the 5 and 7 percent increases of 1996 were outrageous, in Mr. Rosenfeld's tenant-protective eyes, the 2 and 4 percent guidelines of 1994, '95, '97, '98 and '99 were less egregious only to a degree.</p>
        <p>''Two and 4 percent may sound reasonable,'' he said, ''but, if you recall, in almost all those years inflation was significantly lower than in the past, and, in the most recent years, almost nonexistent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pagan, one of the two current tenant representatives, agreed. ''We're talking about zero and maybe 1 percent inflation, and the fact is that they went to 2 and 4,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''This year,'' Mr. Pagan continued, ''oil is the factor that has skewed landlord costs more than anything else, and everybody understands that oil is one of those commodities for which the price will come down at some time.''</p>
        <p>Pointing to the issue of whether the board should allow a one-time spike in a particular economic factor to govern the guidelines, Mr. Pagan said: ''What happens is that we are building in a higher percentage rent increase, and when the oil price comes down and inflation comes down to a normal level, because the oil was pushing it, we will not get a reduction on rent.''</p>
        <p>''So we're just putting costs on top of costs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Referring to an annual study produced by the board's staff called the Price Index of Operating Costs -- or ''the PIOC,'' in board terminology -- Mr. Weinstein said Mr. Pagan was contending ''that if we take a look at the PIOC in relation to the increases voted upon by the board, in general the board lags behind in those years when the PIOC shows abnormal inflation, and the board leads the PIOC in years of moderate or low inflation.''</p>
        <p>''So he's saying that the board tends to act as a moderating force when it comes to prices,'' Mr. Weinstein continued.</p>
        <p>''But I look at a year within itself, as well as within a framework of history, and try to achieve a balance,'' Mr. Weinstein said. ''So his interpretation is that of the tenant representatives, and I don't agree with it. I think what we did was appropriate, based upon the statistics that we saw.''</p>
        <p>''Whatever we do, this board is not going to be popular,'' he said. ''Either the tenants or the landlords are not going to be happy, and probably both.''</p>
        <p>The statistics, compiled by the board's full-time staff of six, provide only guidance to the members in their deliberations, rather than setting a hard-and-fast conclusion.</p>
        <p>Rent stabilization was instituted in 1969 to counter the effects of Rockefeller-era vacancy decontrol laws that allowed a landlord to go to free-market rents when a rent-controlled apartment became vacant. There were widespread instances of landlords forcing out long-time tenants.</p>
        <p>Under stabilization, the owner of a vacated rent-controlled apartment could set an initial free-market rent, after which the rent would be subject to the increases allowed by the board. There are currently about 70,000 rent-controlled apartments in the city, down from more than 1 million at the time stabilization was enacted.</p>
        <p>The rent board's staff prepares at least five reports each year assessing the affordability and profitability of stabilized housing. Probably the most significant are the Price Index of Operating Costs and the Income and Affordability Study.</p>
        <p>Like the federal Consumer Price Index, the PIOC surveys a basket of goods -- among them taxes, labor, fuel and contractor costs -- that estimate the cost of running a rent-stabilized apartment. It then offers a projection of the coming year's expenses for the landlord.</p>
        <p>The Income and Affordability Study focuses on tenants, surveying such factors as their salaries, Social Security, public benefits, rent-to-income ratios, eviction rates and homelessness. It provides a balance to the data on landlord costs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenfeld, who in his years on the board frequently clashed with Mr. Hochman, the chairman, believes the board's political balance has changed in recent years. ''Having been appointed by Mayor Dinkins in '93, the last year of his term, I spent most of my time on the board under the Giuliani administration,'' he said. ''I saw an extreme shift in the attitudes of both the city administration and the Giuliani appointees -- from balancing out the inequities in the rent-regulated universe toward satisfying the landlord and real estate lobbies.'' Of the nine current members, seven -- including the chairman and three other public representatives -- were appointed by Mayor Giuliani. Members serve two-, three- or four-year terms, except for the chairman, who serves at the pleasure of the mayor.</p>
        <p>Bart D. Carmody, one of the new public members, sees no shift in the board's attitude. ''Simply put, when the vote was 2 and 4 percent, the tenants were making statements about the public members being pro-landlord,'' said Mr. Carmody, who is a certified public accountant. ''This year, when the rates, in my view, could have been higher, the landlord advocates are crying that we are pro-tenant. So, my point is: one year yes, one year no.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Castellano, the landlord representative appointed by Mayor Giuliani, thinks ''it's funny how some of the tenant advocates portray the behind-the-scenes politics.''</p>
        <p>''When I hear from them that the mayor has such control over the board,'' he continued, ''the fact is that virtually everybody on the board is doing the mayor a favor by being there, and if he had to replace them it would be difficult, at best. There is not a long line of people who want to take this kind of abuse.''</p>
        <p>THERE is no cohesive bloc of public members, Mr. Castellano said. ''My role and the role of any of the advocate members is to persuade at least two public members to agree with us and, hopefully, get the chair's vote,'' he said. ''That makes a bare majority.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hochman, the chairman, asked rhetorically: ''Does the administration have an interest in what the Rent Guidelines Board does? I not only presume so, I would hope so. Do I, as the only member of the board who, by law, can be fired at any time, the one designated as the administration's representative, talk to the administration?</p>
        <p>''When all the reports come in, I tell the administration that this was the board's factual findings and this is the general range where I anticipate that the preliminary guidelines may be,'' Mr. Hochman continued. ''I have never talked to the mayor on this. Usually I send my report to a deputy mayor. I'll say, 'This is a general range; do you guys have a problem with that?' The answer has always been no.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carmody said, ''I would think the mayor has to look more to the voters than any industry'' -- a point not entirely lost on Mr. Rosenfeld.</p>
        <p>''In appointing the board and approving, to the extent that a mayor does, the final result,'' Mr. Rosenfeld said, ''a mayor is balancing out how much influence the real estate lobby has and the dollars it provides to political campaigns with the potential votes of 1 million regulated apartments.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hochman pointed out that those 1 million apartments house, perhaps, 2 million voters. ''I've always said that if either side ever thanks us, we've probably done a poor job,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 9, 2000, Sunday  An article on June 11 about the New York City Rent Guidelines Board misstated the background to the state legislature's 1969 passage of the Rent Stabilization Law. The law was enacted in response to sharp increases in rents of apartments not subject to the Rent Control regulations, which covered buildings built before 1947. The law was not a response to harassment by landlords seeking to vacate rent-controlled apartments.</p>
