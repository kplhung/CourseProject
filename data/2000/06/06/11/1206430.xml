        <p>AN eight-story brick building here on Carleton Avenue that once served as the medical and surgical building for the old Central Islip State Hospital is being converted into 175,000 square feet of office space by the Arlen Contracting Corporation of Garden City, which bought the property earlier this year from New York State.</p>
        <p>The $12 million project, called the Courthouse Corporate Center, will add the office  component to a master plan adopted in 1989 by the Town of Islip for the 788 acres along Carleton Avenue that were once occupied by the state hospital, a vast psychiatric center that at its peak in the mid-50's had as many as 10,000 patients.</p>
        <p>The New York Institute of Technology has recycled 24 of the smaller hospital buildings for its Central Islip campus. State courts and offices, 800,000 square feet of industrial buildings, 487 town-house condominiums  and 125 subsidized apartments for the elderly and a recently opened 6,000-seat baseball stadium, owned by Suffolk County and leased to the Long Island Ducks, have been built on the grounds of the old hospital.</p>
        <p>A federal court and office building, designed by Richard Meier &amp; Partners, working with the Spector Group of North Hills, is scheduled to open in August, and a 268,000-square-foot shopping center called Town Center is under construction by J. D. Carlisle Development of Manhattan and will be ready for occupancy early next year. Touro College in Manhattan is planning to start construction of a 167,000-square-foot building before the end of the year, to be completed in the fall of 2002. This will replace the college's law school, now in Huntington.</p>
        <p>The Courthouse Corporate Center is within a few minutes' walk from the 495,000-square-foot John P. Cohalan Jr. Center, the state court complex, which opened in 1992, and from the almost-completed 822,000-square-foot federal building. It is expected to attract law firms and related businesses as well as high-technology companies.</p>
        <p>Arlen Contracting bought the medical and surgical building on Feb. 9 for $2.2 million as part of a package that included 52 acres and  845,000 square feet of space in six buildings.  In addition to the medical and surgical building, the other five buildings are the former hospital's power plant, laundry, a food distribution center and two administration buildings. All six buildings on the property were vacated about five years ago.</p>
        <p>The property went to Arlen after it submitted the high bid to the state's Economic Development Corporation, which is selling  off surplus state-owned psychiatric hospitals. This was the last piece of the Central Islip hospital property that was still state-owned. The hospital began discharging or transferring patients starting in the 1960's.  Its only remaining presence in Central Islip is a small group home on nine acres fronting on Carleton Avenue. This is now part of the Arlen property, and Arlen is now leasing it back to the state. Its 25 residents will be transferred to the Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center in Brentwood in about two years when a new group home is completed there.</p>
        <p>BEFORE Arlen can convert any of its  buildings, rezoning for each must first be approved by the Islip Town Board, and state environmental reviews must also be satisfied. Rezoning for the medical and surgical building, from education use to offices, was approved last week. The project still needs approvals for landscaping and parking plans. Arlen intends to submit separate rezoning applications for each of its other buildings, said Alvin Benjamin, the company's president.</p>
        <p>Arlen has tentative plans for its other five buildings, Mr. Benjamin said: converting one of the 200,000-square-foot administration buildings into a nursing home or housing for the elderly; converting the 60,000-square-foot former power plant into a gymnasium and day-care center; using the 80,000-square-foot former laundry as an industrial and research-and-development site, and leasing the 130,000-square-foot former food distribution center for classrooms. The second 200,000-square-foot administration building directly behind the Courthouse Corporte Center will be demolished to provide parking for 700 cars. The nine acres surrounding the group home are being viewed by Arlen as a potential site for a 140-room hotel. Mr. Benjamin said Arlen would take four to five years to complete the redevelopment of the 52 acres.</p>
        <p>Arlen has placed CB Richard Ellis, an international brokerage company with offices in Garden City, in charge of leasing the office space. Annual asking rents at the  Courthouse Corporate Center are $20 a square foot. Utilities and taxes are expected to add about $4 a square foot to the rents.</p>
        <p>Two leases, one for 2,500 square feet and one for 4,000 square feet, are already being negotiated with two law firms, said Raymond A. Ruiz, the vice president of CB Richard Ellis who is in charge of leasing at the courthouse center. Tenants can lease space as small as 1,500 square feet.</p>
        <p>Asbestos removal and demolition of interior partitions have begun as a first step in creating three furnished model offices of  1,500 square feet to 4,000 square feet. The models are expected to be ready for showing within 45 days, said Russell A. Mohr, Arlen's director of sales and leasing, and the  renovated building will be ready for occupancy ''by the fourth quarter.''</p>
        <p>Strong interest in leasing has already come from law firms, abstract companies, court reporters and mortgage groups, Mr. Benjamin said. ''Originally, the question was, 'Would there be enough demand?' '' he said. ''Now the question is, 'When will the building be ready for occupancy?' ''</p>
        <p>From a designer's point of view, the major challenge in converting the building from institutional to office use was changing ''the image of the building,'' said Louis P. Giacalone, the partner in charge of the project at Ehasz Giacalone Architects in Farmingdale.</p>
        <p>The brick facade is being left intact, but  two metal-roofed penthouses, each 4,000 square feet in size, will be added to the eighth floor. New windows will be installed, and a porte-cochere will be added to the  entrance facing Carleton Avenue. A rear lobby will lead to the parking lot. Both lobbies will have granite floors, and the front lobby will have skylights. The building will be equipped with high-speed data and telecommunications connections.</p>
        <p>THE building, which is 68 feet wide and 273 feet long, lends itself easily to an office conversion, Mr. Giacalone said.  The elevator core -- two banks of two elevators each, facing each other -- creates spacious lobbies on each floor, he said, and  floors can be easily divided into individual offices suites that range in size from 1,500 square feet to 8,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>A series of formal gardens will be created on one and a half acres of sloping land leading down to Carleton Avenue. They will  be planted with flowering shrubs, seasonal flowers and trees indigenous to the area.  Outdoor seating will be added. The landscape architect is William W. Johnson of Southold.</p>
        <p>Tenants leasing space in the building will be able to benefit from its location within the Town of Islip's 1.7-square-mile Economic Development Zone, which covers portions of the former hospital property. Companies relocating to the zone get credits on their New York State taxes if they provide new jobs, and they receive a 40 percent discount on their energy costs, among other benefits, said William G. Mannix, Islip's director of economic development.</p>
        <p>The turnaround at the former hospital site from largely vacant buildings to thriving commercial and residential hub began in 1982 when the New York Institute of Technology, whose main campus is in Old Westbury, responded to a proposal by Michael A. LoGrande, then the Town of Islip planning director and later town supervisor and Suffolk County executive, that the hospital property would make an ideal college campus. The college purchased 31 buildings and 564 of the 788 acres from New York State for $5.5 million. The Central Islip campus, now reduced to 175 acres because the college has sold off or donated part of its property, now has 1,000 students.</p>
        <p>Most of the college-owned buildings are smaller two- and three-story structures. Arlen Contracting bought the larger hospital buildings, and its plan to turn the former medical and surgical building into offices has been welcomed by community leaders.</p>
        <p>''We are very supportive of the office building because there was concern that some of these big buildings might be difficult to recycle,'' said Nancy Manfredonia, the executive director of the Central Islip Civic Council, a coalition of civic associations that has played an active role in the planning process at the hospital site. ''This will be a very attractive facility in a very visible spot.''</p>
        <p>The fortunes of Central Islip, whose economy was heavily dependent on the hospital where many residents worked, declined as the psychiatric hospital began shutting down in the 1960's. Now with the opening of the baseball stadium, the presence of the county court complex, a 50,000-square-foot King Kullen and a 20-screen Loews movie theater as the anchor tenants at Town Center, and the soon-to-open federal building,  ''the community itself has awakened and become excited about what is going on here,'' Ms. Manfredonia said.</p>
        <p>''We believe we are on the leading edge of what suburbia can be,'' she added. ''People have the idea that suburbia is boring. Central Islip is definitely not boring. We're a very exciting town right now.''</p>
