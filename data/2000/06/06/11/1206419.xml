        <p>ALL those baby boomers who envy the wealth of the young Internet moguls can take solace, at least, in this: the dot-commers may live in fabulous places, but they often work so hard they have little time to exploit the opportunities for fun their good fortune presents.</p>
        <p>Last November, John Galbraith and Chi-Lin Chang decided to start an Internet company that would allow people to browse and shop privately, without revealing name, e-mail address or credit card information to individual vendors. They quickly raised money.</p>
        <p>''I had a financial background,'' said Mr. Galbraith, 24, who had worked at a brokerage company and  a financial Internet site. And, he said, ''some of my family's friends are in the venture-capital world.'' Mr. Chang, 21 and like Mr. Galbraith a New Yorker, decided to take a leave from his junior year at Columbia, where he is majoring in economics. He had met Mr. Galbraith when they were both working on Internet sites and were considering a joint venture.</p>
        <p>In January, money in hand, they brought in Bill Holmberg, 25, who had gone to Georgetown University with Mr. Galbraith (no relation to the economist John Kenneth Galbraith). They began looking for a place for their new company, Incogniti Inc., that could be both office and home.</p>
        <p>The three young men, who swivel seamlessly in midconversation to answer telephones, started in the usual way, checking advertisements and meeting with brokers. In a story that is becoming eerily familiar, they told  of going with one broker who took them to a large sweatshop and promised that if they rented the space, all the people would be gone in short order.</p>
        <p>FINALLY, they hooked up with Lake Shaw, a broker for CitiHabitats, who took them to a 34-story building in the financial district that is handled by her company. The former office building, at 100 John Street, was renovated and turned into apartments. But what she showed the three men was hardly a regular place.</p>
        <p>It is a house in the sky, a meandering four-story penthouse with four bedrooms, six bathrooms, huge windows giving views in three directions, and a rooftop terrace shared with the rest of the building but contiguous with their space.</p>
        <p>They immediately took the penthouse, which rents for $9,500 a month, and because their business had no financial history, paid a year's rent in advance. The original rent being asked was $15,000 a month, they said, and someone had taken it at that price but backed out when it became clear that the roof deck was shared.</p>
        <p>They use their first floor, the former living room, as an office, with space for a half-dozen desks and a conference room.</p>
        <p>They are working on readying  their site, www.ivanish.com, which is scheduled to launch in September. Internet users will be able to log on to ivanish.com and type in their destinations from there, and they will be able to shop by revealing their personal data and credit card information only to this company, and not to the actual vendors who sell them merchandise.</p>
        <p>Lunch tends to be things like Tortino's pizza rolls, cooked in the microwave. Upstairs on the middle two floors each of them has a large bedroom and private bath; the top floor is an entertainment center, leading to the deck.</p>
        <p>''This is great for single guys,'' said Chang. ''But a family is not going to want to live here.'' The neighborhood has few children, he says, and lacks stores and services, although a large grocery store called Jubilee, with good vegetables and fruit, and a range of upscale products and organic foods, just opened up the street. ''Jubilee is like a haven,'' Mr. Chang said.</p>
        <p>They liked the penthouse because it was ready to go, not a raw space. And if they ever have time, they'll take advantage of its spectacular views of Manhattan, looking north. ''We haven't had any dinner parties yet,'' Mr. Galbraith said. ''But every time we achieve a big milestone we want to have a big party.''</p>
        <p>The three start working every morning at about 9 and continue until about 10 at night. ''Since we're here, we can work all the time,'' Mr. Galbraith said. And there's no wasted time. ''What I love is that the commute is quick and easy,'' Mr. Chang said.''And there's a gym downstairs. That keeps me sane.''</p>
        <p>The neighborhood, he said, ''gets very barren at night and on weekends.'' Not that it matters, really. ''When I go out . . . ,'' Mr. Chang said, ''well, I'm usually too lazy to get out of my room.''</p>
