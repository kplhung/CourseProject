        <p>LOBSTERS and low prices don't go together. This delicacy usually costs between $15 and $20 a pound at local restaurants. And this year, a mysterious malady has been decimating the local lobster crop, forcing fish markets and eating places to import them from Maine, which pushes prices even higher. Yet there are a few funky, no-frills eateries scattered around the Island that still offer lobster at modest prices.</p>
        <p>Fisherman's Reef, a down-and-dirty barroom restaurant in Bayville, was one such spot, serving one-and-a-quarter-pound lobster dinners for $7.95 and $8.95 until it closed last August. Then about two months ago, Twin Lobster (owned by twin brothers) took its place in Bayville, and bargain-hunting lobster lovers have been cautiously returning to 355 Bayville Avenue (516-628-1500) ever since. Although not nearly as inexpensive as Fisherman's Reef, Twin Lobster still manages to answer the question, ''Where can I get an inexpensive lobster dinner?''</p>

        <p>LOBSTERS and low prices don't go together. This delicacy usually costs between $15 and $20 a pound at local restaurants. And this year, a mysterious malady has been decimating the local lobster crop, forcing fish markets and eating places to import them from Maine, which pushes prices even higher. Yet there are a few funky, no-frills eateries scattered around the Island that still offer lobster at modest prices.</p>
        <p>Fisherman's Reef, a down-and-dirty barroom restaurant in Bayville, was one such spot, serving one-and-a-quarter-pound lobster dinners for $7.95 and $8.95 until it closed last August. Then about two months ago, Twin Lobster (owned by twin brothers) took its place in Bayville, and bargain-hunting lobster lovers have been cautiously returning to 355 Bayville Avenue (516-628-1500) ever since. Although not nearly as inexpensive as Fisherman's Reef, Twin Lobster still manages to answer the question, ''Where can I get an inexpensive lobster dinner?''</p>
        <p>But stick to lobster, the plainer the better. After the very basic lobster dishes, the menu takes a steep downhill turn. Even slight deviations like stuffed lobster and lobster rolls don't fare as well as the unadulterated steamed or boiled versions. Instead, order the restaurant's title dish: twin lobsters, two one-pounders for $18.95, or the pound-and-a-quarter $13.95 special. They were fresh, with sweet meat, and were served with tender asparagus. (Both were far superior to a $24, pound-and-a-quarter lobster with the consistency of runny yogurt that I had earlier in the week at a fancy, overpriced South Shore restaurant).</p>
        <p>To avoid the possibility of water logging, steamed lobsters are the better option.</p>
        <p>All stuffings at Twin Lobster, including the crab-meat mixture in the $16.95 lobster special, are bready and not nearly as hot as what they stuff. Diners who expect the hot or cold lobster rolls ($9.95) to be chunks of meat with tartar sauce in a squared-off hot dog roll will be surprised to be served a tiny open-faced sandwich on the bottom half of a small hamburger bun, topped with a few specks of creamed lobster.</p>
        <p>The fanned-out silver dollar-size slices of fried potatoes and finely diced mixed fresh vegetables that accompanied entrees passed muster, as did a full-bodied, luscious lobster bisque ($3.95) with perhaps a squirt or two of sherry. But a watery Manhattan clam chowder, a soup of the day, with no clams evident and with scant vegetables, was a disaster, as were mushy, bready, lukewarm, stuffed mushrooms ($7.95).</p>
        <p>Eight tiny clams oreganato ($6.95), buried in sauce-soaked breading with slightly burned surfaces and sauteed scallops ($16.95), were doused in butter sauce. A big dull crab cake ($16.95) was packed with bland filler and presented without tartar sauce.</p>
        <p>The $19.95 Bayville bucket (one-half lobster, one-half chicken, ribs, steamers and corn) sounded like a bargain. Unfortunately, each ingredient was a different temperature, ranging from hot to barely warm, and the lobster was inexplicably omitted (though a batch of unannounced mussels made an appearance). While the chicken in this bucket had been nuked into dusty dryness, the ribs, though not the slow-cooked, fall-from-the-bone version, were meaty and tasty. (They were as a $16.95 entree as well.)</p>
        <p>Service at the spruced-up, but still modest Twin Lobster is pleasant, prompt and polite but unpolished, even vacant at times.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>Station Road, a new restaurant serving a seafood-dominated menu of eclectic global cuisine, takes over where Station Bistro had been, at 50 Station Road in Water Mill (631-726-3016). The new owner, Dean Golden, has established other East End restaurants, including Fresno Place in East Hampton, Sen in Sag Harbor, Wild Rose Cafe in Bridgehampton and Harbor Rose in Sag Harbor. Tim Smith, the chef, is a holdover from the Station Bistro.</p>
        <p>Korean crab cakes will be one of the signature dishes at the 45-seat spot, where appetizers will cost $7 to $12 and entrees $18 to $32.</p>
        <p>Potpourri</p>
        <p>The local chapter of the Single Gourmet recently announced Long Island's top 20 restaurants of 1999. Rated by attendees at weekly dinners, the restaurants were judged for their ambience, presentation, food and service. The top three restaurants are Cafe Europa, at the Roslyn Claremont; Franina Ristorante, Syosset, and La Pace, Glen Cove.</p>
        <p>La Coquille restaurant, at 1669 Northern Boulevard in Manhasset (516-365-8422), now offers harp music on Monday nights and a chef's seafood tasting menu. The four-course dinner is $35. The restaurant also has a new executive chef, James Holt, a 1987 graduate of the Culinary Institute of America who worked at La Caravelle in Manhattan.</p>
