        <p>What man wouldn't want the gift of never having to ask for directions? Red Maps' Essential Guides for Urban Explorers offer sleek, high-design maps with detailed information on museums, architecture, shops, theaters and hotels.

        <p>''The idea was to create a graphic, beautiful picture of each urban center as it is right now,'' said James Leniart, the company's founder, who updates the maps every few months. ''Granted, they may not be maps to drive or travel by, but they're maps to live and enjoy by.'' The glossy, laminated three-to-five-panel maps are also blissfully easy to fold ($5.95 each at Takashimaya and Barnes &amp; Noble bookstores).</p>
