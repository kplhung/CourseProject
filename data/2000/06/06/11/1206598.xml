        <p>A nice irony of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision last week is that he rejected the suggestion of smashing the world's most powerful software company into a bunch of ''Baby Bills,'' and instead proposed to split Microsoft into two behemoths that would dominate their respective markets.</p>
        <p>In fact, a major legacy of the Clinton administration will be that it encouraged one of the greatest periods of industrial concentration in American history, affecting old and new sectors ranging from oil and pharmaceuticals, to telecommunications, broadcasting and the Internet. Call it the Age of Oligopoly.</p>
        <p>Corporate mergers have grown so frequent and so large, said Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, that ''there's not a week that goes by that we're not called upon to review a big merger that has significant implications for the marketplace.''</p>
        <p>The Seven Sister oil companies have shrunk to five  (or even fewer if you consider the joint marketing and production agreements between them); the seven Baby Bells are now four; and American and foreign car producers, once great rivals, are now intertwined to the point where it is difficult to figure out who actually manufactures the Mercedes, Chrysler, Nissan or Volvo next to you at a traffic light.</p>
        <p>As last week's headlines made clear, no corner of the economy seems untouched. Executives from the parent company of American Airlines were in talks about possible mergers with Delta or Northwest, prompted by United Airlines's decision to acquire USAir. The Federal Communications Commission approved AT&amp;T's acquisition of MediaOne, troubling consumer advocates by clearing the way for the emergence of a company that will control about a third of the cable television market, large television programming units, and the biggest high-speed Internet service.</p>
        <p>There may be a new round of packaged food mergers, set off after Unilever, the maker of Lipton Tea, Ragu tomato sauces and Breyers ice cream, offered $20 billion to buy Bestfoods, producer of Skippy peanut butter, Mueller's pastas and Thomas' English muffins.</p>
        <p>While there are undoubted economic benefits to consolidation -- cheaper goods, more uniform quality and better distribution -- economics and antitrust theory cannot measure the fundamental changes in the character and quality of life that comes with size. For example, economic analysis won't tell how to deal with, say, the merger of banks and insurance companies and the potential privacy threats that result when one company holds both your medical and financial records.</p>
        <p>The gospel that bigness is not necessarily badness has been preached on both sides of the political aisle for about 20 years. During the 12 years of the Reagan and Bush administrations, an era widely remembered for frenzied merger activity and devotion to a laissez-faire regulatory approach, there were 44,518 mergers and acquisitions in the United States, with a combined value of $2.17 trillion, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. By contrast, the seven-and-a-half years of the Clinton administration have witnessed 71,811 corporate deals valued at $6.66 trillion.</p>
        <p>''We live in perhaps the most dynamic economy in at least a generation or more,'' Mr. Pitofsky said. ''There are many firms trying to adjust to new economic circumstances and global competition, striving to find new efficiencies. That's all fine with us. It's the relatively few mergers that present problems.''</p>
        <p>Over all, however, the days of Small Is Beautiful, the title of E.F. Schumacher's 60's paean to smallness of economic scale, now seem a quaint relic of an earlier age. ''We can't go back to a Jeffersonian world or a literal Brandeis concern about human-sized institutions because we'd pay a terrible efficiency price in terms of technological innovation and global competitiveness,'' said Harvey J. Goldschmid, an antitrust expert at Columbia Law School. ''The trick is take account of the modern needs for efficiency but still use antitrust to give us workably competitive markets.''</p>
        <p>When is a marketplace sufficiently competitive in the minds of regulators?</p>
        <p>''Antitrust authorities don't worry about consolidation per se, they only worry about it when it gets to the tipping point,'' said Robert Litan, a former antitrust official in the Justice Department and now director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. That point, in many cases, is reached when a market is effectively controlled by just one or two players, he said.</p>
        <p>There have been some notable instances when the Clinton administration has blocked or restructured mergers that would have passed unscathed under the Republicans. Still, more than 95 percent of the cases reviewed have encountered no resistance from Federal antitrust officials.</p>
        <p>Thus far, only a handful of critics and lawmakers have raised concerns about the increasing size of corporations and concentration of markets, though some are questioning whether antitrust law is able to factor in the non-economic costs of all the dealmaking.</p>
        <p>When the F.C.C., for instance, approved AT&amp;T's merger with MediaOne, only one of the commissioners expressed any significant concern about the declining number of media voices that will result from the deal.</p>
        <p>Noting that the commission's approval means that five companies will control 40 of the 59 viable cable networks, the commissioner, Gloria Tristani, wrote, ''It's time for the FCC to realize that we are not dealing with bottled water or sneakers, but with the dissemination of news and information -- the lifeblood of our democratic way of life. In the last few years, the number of entitles that control what people watch on television has dwindled to alarming levels. With this decision, the F.C.C. has failed yet again to stem this crisis and ensure a robust marketplace of ideas.''</p>
        <p>Mark Crispin Miller, director of the Project on Media Ownership and a professor of media studies at New York University, said current antitrust tools fail to recognize what is actually lost by all the mergers.</p>
        <p>''The danger of media concentration lies not in the risk of prices getting higher, which is what antitrust measures,'' Professor Miller said. ''The real danger is much subtler. You're talking about the disappearance of alternative views. You're talking about an exponential increase in conflicts of interest. You're talking about fewer interests having greater market power. You're talking about the rise of trivial programming. These are consequences that are extremely troubling, that worry most Americans, but that don't attract any kind of sustained political or judicial attention because they are not simply economically quantifiable.''</p>
        <p>At present, the march to oligopoly seems irreversible. Microsoft, if broken up into separate operating systems and applications companies, will hardly be high-tech start-ups in a garage. They will cover the world with their products. ''Technology will not go backwards and the integration of markets will not go backwards and the growth of the global shareholder, putting more and more countries and companies under the microscope of investor scrutiny will not go backwards,'' said Daniel Yergin, whose book, ''The Commanding Heights,'' is about the changing balance between governments and international markets.</p>
        <p>But the same forces that have helped propel growth could slow it down, if not reverse it. Globalization has been financed largely by the world's investors, particularly institutions like pension and retirement funds, which relentlessly seek higher returns for their money. This has put enormous pressure on companies to find new markets and produce ever stronger quarterly earnings.</p>
        <p>An economic downturn could cause investors to pull their money out of stocks, and lead governments to erect barriers to free trade. This would make it harder and less profitable for multinationals to sell their products around the globe.</p>
        <p>Still, the world shouldn't hold its breath waiting for businesses to shrink. There is just too much commercial logic on the side of size. The real job ahead is for governments and individuals to learn how to benefit from and to some extent control the vast corporations the age has spawned.</p>
