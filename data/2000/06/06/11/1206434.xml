        <p>VACANCY rates for prime office space in Stamford have dropped to record lows, local real estate professionals say, while rents are at all-time highs. Blocks of space over 200,000 square feet no longer exist in the county, and blocks of 100,000 square feet are scarce.</p>
        <p>Theoretically, this would justify new construction, but the only new office building in Fairfield County is going up in Wilton, outside the Stamford-Greenwich-Westport orbit of commercial development.</p>

        <p>VACANCY rates for prime office space in Stamford have dropped to record lows, local real estate professionals say, while rents are at all-time highs. Blocks of space over 200,000 square feet no longer exist in the county, and blocks of 100,000 square feet are scarce.</p>
        <p>Theoretically, this would justify new construction, but the only new office building in Fairfield County is going up in Wilton, outside the Stamford-Greenwich-Westport orbit of commercial development.</p>
        <p>In downtown Stamford, the Louis Dreyfus Property Group is to break ground this summer for a 574,000-square-foot project.</p>
        <p>So why aren't more buildings going up?  ''Fairfield and Westchester Counties have had their troubles, and lenders have long memories,'' explained Dean J. Shapiro, executive director of Insignia/ESG's Westchester-Connecticut office in Stamford. To get financing, developers must typically  show commitments for leases covering 40 or 50 percent of a project.</p>
        <p>Tabulated by various real estate companies, Stamford's office vacancy rate is 4.9 percent to 6.5 percent, down from almost 8 percent a year ago. Rents are headed in the opposite direction. Asking prices are around $29 a square foot a year, up from the mid-$20's last year, but because of the competition for space, prospective tenants are bidding up prices, and landlords are actually getting $38 to $40 a square foot, according to Ed Tonnessen, an executive vice president of Albert B. Ashforth Inc., a commercial real estate company in Stamford.</p>
        <p>Rates at Greenwich Plaza, the pair of office buildings flanking the Metro-North railroad tracks in Greenwich, have reached $60 a square foot, and Westport offices are commanding rents of up to $50 a square foot,  commercial leasing agents say. Deals are mostly for 20,000 to 50,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>Out of Stamford's 16.7 million square feet  of total office space, about one million is listed as available. But Jeffrey Dunne, senior vice president in the Stamford office of  CB Richard Ellis, an international real estate brokerage company, said that most of this is smaller Class B space. Even so,  ''tenants are waiting in line, bidding up,'' he added.</p>
        <p>In this supercharged market, he said he had seen evidence of abuse: tenants' rights of first refusal have been ignored by landlords greedy for sweeter deals, and one landlord demanded a $5,000 fee, supposedly for legal services, before he would grant a  lease.</p>
        <p>Under such circumstances, what's a company to do? Head into Fairfield County's hinterlands as companies did 30 years ago when Greenwich became home to corporations fleeing high-priced Manhattan. Now  companies are scrambling to find alternatives to high-priced Stamford.</p>
        <p>''What used to be secondary locations,  like the Route 7 corridor from Norwalk to Wilton, are becoming preferred locations,''  Mr. Tonnessen said. ''They are popular because of the proximity to the executives' bedroom communities in New Canaan, Weston, Westport and Wilton.''</p>
        <p>The one major construction project under way in Wilton is the Louis Dreyfus Property Group's 335,000-square-foot building on a 57-acre tract at 20 Westport Road. Dreyfus obtained preleasing agreements from News America Marketing Inc. of Norwalk, a subsidiary of the News Corporation, for 110,000 square feet; Mercator, a Wilton software company, for 57,860 square feet; and John W. Henry &amp; Company, a Westport financial services firm, for 19,000 square feet. The Louis Dreyfus Corporation, the property group's parent company, will take 113,000 square feet, vacating its offices at 10 Westport Road, an adjacent 200,000-square-foot building it has occupied for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>The new building, accommodating tenants requiring 25,000 to 115,000 square feet, is expected to be completed in July 2001. Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo &amp; Associates, the New Haven architectural firm, designed both 10 and 20 Westport Road.</p>
        <p>Dreyfus contends that timing for this new construction is just right. ''We saw the pent-up demand left by the last 10 years, and we  picked sites like Wilton for the eventual recovery,'' said David J. Friedman, the Northeast regional vice president of the Louis Dreyfus Property Group. ''Wilton has established itself as an office market in the last few years.'' The town has about 1.4 million square feet of office space, with a vacancy rate of about 3 percent.</p>
        <p>Dreyfus's Stamford project, called Connecticut Place, is a 23-story office tower designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. Mr. Friedman said that Dreyfus was talking with potential tenants who were interested in leasing 25,000, 150,000, 175,000 and 300,000 square feet and that the company planned to break ground ''as early as Aug. 1.'' The building will have a restaurant overlooking the Mill River, a fitness center, a sundry shop and a cafeteria.</p>
        <p>News America Marketing looked at Connecticut Place before choosing 20 Westport Road. Timothy O'Connell, News America Marketing's director of facilities and real estate, said, ''We are an expanding company, and the uncertain timing for the Stamford building wasn't right for us.''</p>
        <p>AS the planned starting date nears for Connecticut Place, another prominent Stamford office complex is being offered for sale. First Stamford Place, three buildings with 767,000 square feet near the  railroad station and Exit 7 of Interstate 95,  has been put up for sale by its owner, TrizecHahn of Toronto, through Eastdil Realty Inc. of New York.</p>
        <p>W&amp;M Properties of Stamford and New York is one of the prospective buyers. ''It's a terrific asset, and there's a lot of capital chasing assets out there,'' said Jeffrey H. Newman, the executive vice president in charge of the company's 1.5-million-square-foot suburban portfolio. ''But our three most recent acquisitions were in Westchester. Stamford may have topped off.''</p>
        <p>As demand pushes outward, Westchester County is benefiting from Stamford's office gridlock. ''Westchester had a terrific first quarter, '' Mr. Newman said, adding: ''You can still get Class A space at $10 to $15 a square foot less than in Fairfield County.''</p>
        <p>Brokers said that in Westchester blocks of space in vacant or nearly vacant buildings ranged from 200,000 square feet to 500,000 square feet at 900 King Street in Rye, the Mount Pleasant Executive Center, and at 333 Westchester Avenue and 445 Hamilton Avenue in White Plains.</p>
        <p>Companies needing space now may well be looking at areas outside Greenwich,  Stamford or Westport. Areas outside lower Fairfield County offer lower construction and land costs, faster building time and sometimes fewer delays in obtaining municipal approvals.</p>
        <p>''Companies looking for space have a difficult time making decisions two or three years ahead,'' said David Fiore, the director of the Wilton office of the Davis Companies,  a real estate investment, management and development concern. ''It takes much longer to build vertically in a dense city environment than horizontally on a suburban campus. In Stamford new construction is a several-year process -- for approvals, procuring tenants, getting financing and completing construction.''</p>
        <p>Davis, which has offices in Boston and Wilton, owns four office buildings with 655,000 square feet along the Route 7 corridor in Wilton -- at 15 Old Danbury Road, 50 and 64 Danbury Road and 187 Danbury Road -- and in Norwalk at 200 Connecticut Avenue (Route 1).</p>
        <p>Two years ago the company built a speculative Class A office building on its 20-acre campus called Reservoir Corporate Center in Shelton. Completed last year at a cost of $19.625 million, the building, with 157,000 square feet, is fully leased, Mr. Fiore said. ''We built in 10 months at half the cost of Stamford,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Rents are $21 a square foot in Shelton and $30 to $35 a square foot in the Wilton and Norwalk buildings. Shelton has approved the company's plans to build two additional buildings with a total of 240,000 square feet at Reservoir Corporate Center, but this time, instead of building on speculation,  substantial lease commitments will be sought before Davis breaks ground, Mr. Fiore said.</p>
        <p>Davis bought the buildings at 50 and 64 Danbury Road in Wilton only last month for $26.5 million. The site is a 60-acre campus; 50 Danbury Road contains 216,000 square feet and 64 Danbury has 45,000 square feet.  The seller was the PE Corporation (formerly Perkin-Elmer), a maker of analytical instruments, which will remain as a tenant  in the larger building; its lease expires in  May 2001. LaMotte Burns &amp; Company occupies the smaller building; its lease expires in June 2005.</p>
        <p>The buildings' wooded site has a picnic area, horseshoe pits, jogging trails and tennis, basketball and volleyball courts. The larger building will undergo a $9 million renovation, which will add a fitness center and a cafeteria where employees' spouses and children can come in for lunch.</p>
        <p>''This is a new era where the employees are what companies are all about,'' Mr. Fiore said. ''If you want to keep them, you must provide amenities.''</p>
