        <p>Responding rapidly to a 15-state advertising campaign by the Democrats, the Republican Party yesterday unveiled its first national television commercial, a spot detailing Gov. George W. Bush's proposals for overhauling Social Security. It will begin running tomorrow in 17 states, from New England to the Pacific Northwest.</p>
        <p>The swiftness with which the Republican National Committee is taking to the airwaves is a marked departure from four years ago, when the Democratic Party began running issue advertisements on behalf of President Clinton weeks before the cash-strapped Republicans could start commercials for their presidential candidate, Bob Dole.</p>
        <p>Republicans and Democrats say this first volley of spots establishes the pace for a highly expensive parry-and-thrust on the air that is likely to continue virtually uninterrupted until Election Day.</p>
        <p>The Republican commercial is being paid for with a mixture of hard  money, raised under federal limits, and soft money, the unrestricted contributions made to political parties by corporations, unions and wealthy individuals. The Democrats' spot,  which went up on Thursday to advertise Vice President Al Gore's support for expanding Medicare benefits to cover prescription drugs, is being paid for in the same manner.</p>
        <p>The widespread use of soft money in political advertising itself became an issue in recent weeks, as Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore tried to portray each other as unwilling to stop employing the money in their campaigns.</p>
        <p>The Democrats have estimated that their initial advertising campaign, to run until the conventions, will cost $25 million or more.</p>
        <p>Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said yesterday that his party's initial commercial would run 7 to 10 days and cost more than $2 million.</p>
        <p>''We had no intention of starting to run issue ads until Gore broke his pledge,'' Mr. Nicholson said. ''They pledged not to run issue ads. But they broke that pledge because their campaign is faltering. They're in a desperate situation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has said he made no such pledge, but had told Republican leaders that he would not run issue spots paid for with soft money if the Republicans promised not to do so. He said the Republicans declined to take up his challenge. Unlike the Democrats' half-minute spot, the Republican commercial runs 60 seconds, and it takes on a far riskier and more complicated issue. It is one that Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore have sparred over in recent weeks: how to ensure the federal retirement-benefits system does not go bankrupt as vast numbers of aging baby boomers move ever closer to eligibility for retirement checks.</p>
        <p>In the commercial, produced by Alex Castellanos, a media consultant, an announcer explains Mr. Bush's approach: ''The Bush plan guarantees everyone at or near retirement every dollar of their benefits. You paid into it, it's your money and it will be there for you. And the Bush plan gives younger workers a choice to invest a small part of their Social Security in sound investments they control, for higher returns.''</p>
        <p>That last declaration derives from a speech on May 15 by Mr. Bush, in which he proposed a partial privatization of Social Security that would fundamentally change the system by allowing workers to invest some of their payroll taxes on their own.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore denounced the proposal as dangerous, contending that taxpayers would be vulnerable to losing their retirement savings in fraudulent and foolhardy investments.</p>
        <p>Some Republican strategists close to Mr. Bush acknowledged the Republican National Committee spot addressed a much more politically treacherous issue than the one the Democrats chose for their first commercial for Mr. Gore. That, they said, was part of the point.</p>
        <p>''It's as much a spot about leadership as it is about Social Security,'' asserted a Bush adviser. ''What people like most is someone who seems to have the courage to do what's right.''</p>
        <p>Democratic officials, however, said they thought there was a lot in the spot that would work against Mr. Bush. It begins, they point out, with the announcer noting that ''our nation is at peace and more prosperous than ever.'' Joe Andrew, national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said, ''I'm going to be quoting the first sentence of the ad between now and the election.'' He added that Democrats would assert  that the Bush plan could force cuts in retirement benefits and lead to an increase in the retirement age.</p>
        <p>The Republicans are going to run the spot in the 15 states in which the Democrats' commercial is being broadcast. Among the other states where the commercials will run are several electoral vote-rich states that some strategists believe may determine the winner of the general election, including Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>The other states where the parties' commercials will be running are Georgia, Florida, Washington, Oregon, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Mexico, Missouri and Wisconsin and Maryland. The Republicans added Arkansas and Maine.</p>
