        <p>WHEN Debbie Bittner learned that her employer, General Motors, planned to spin off its automotive parts division as Delphi Automotive Systems last year, she faced leaving the only company she had ever known. Her first job out of high school had been at a G.M. steering-column plant in Saginaw, Mich., and for more than 21 years she held nine jobs in six different parts of the company, from finance to operations to customer care.</p>
        <p>G.M. was family. Her father, Fred Keyes, recently retired after 38 years as a skilled tradesman. Her grandfather had been a foundry worker. Yet as proud as she is of her G.M. roots, she finds herself defending her allegiance to Delphi, to which she was assigned on Jan. 1, 1999. ''My father said, 'Maybe you should see if you can stay with G.M.,' '' she said, recalling a recent conversation with him and her brother, Mark Keyes, who also works at Delphi. ''We said, 'No, we think this is a good thing.' ''</p>
        <p>Good for her stock options and her career, which she said is thriving in the cozier environment of the new company, whose stock is up slightly since its initial offering at $17 in February 1999 -- nothing to celebrate, but better than the 5 percent drop in G.M.'s stock over the period.</p>
        <p>''It allowed a 40-year-old to be creative again,'' Ms. Bittner said. ''When we were under G.M., we were like 'Well, corporate says we have to do it this way.' ''</p>
        <p>The transition has had its share of complications. Her new job is marketing manager in Troy, Mich., for the sales team that handles the G.M. account, which means that her agents sell Delphi products to people who used to work down the hall.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of an unnatural relationship -- selling and buying -- that we're trying to get natural again,'' she said. The official line is to treat G.M. as just another very important client. Still, she said, some Delphi employees feel odd when they must sign in as ''visitors'' and be escorted around the G.M. technical center in Warren, Mich., a building  they know so well. And she sometimes slips up on the use of ''us'' and ''them.''</p>
        <p>''When you're talking to your ex-fellow employees, that's where you get yourself a little mixed up, because you think you're one entity,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Before the split was official, the rumors and bits of information were frustrating. But once the news was public, her superiors held small group discussions and solicited employees' ideas on the transition.</p>
        <p>That, she said, would be a good lesson for Microsoft. ''You have to have exceptionally strong communication,'' she said. ''You have to allow the people some choices. You have to relieve their nervousness about change. They don't want everything dumped on them at once. Let them get comfortable with something before something else comes up.''</p>
        <p>Some people in her division did leave, many taking early G.M. retirement. ''People kept talking new, new, new, which to some people means change, change, change, and not everyone likes that,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Even tiny changes, like a new signature on paychecks, give pause. But more important, she said, ''the checks keeps coming.''</p>
        <p>As for family tradition, her 20-year-old son Jason, a college student, is working at Delphi this summer.</p>
