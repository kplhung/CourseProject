        <p>JOEL THOMAS loves New York City at night. ''In daytime, it's hectic, it's 'I'm going to beat your brains out, rush, rush, rush,' '' he said. ''At night, the entire atmosphere changes. It's about relaxation, recreation. And it's beautiful. All those lights.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas, a 44-year-old Mamaroneck resident, should know. This month marks his fifth year running New York by Night, a company that shows people the city in the evening hours.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas, who has been a jazz and rock musician and a limousine driver, has a Dodge van that seats 15 -- ''the biggest thing you can drive legally on Westchester parkways without being called a bus.''</p>
        <p>He makes appointments with individuals, groups, whoever wants to go, and, for $70 a person, takes them on a five-hour narrated, sightseeing drive through Manhattan, with an hourlong stop for dinner at the Market Diner on 11th Avenue and 43rd Street along the way. For information on the tours, call  (914) 777-5057). His name is known to Westchester's 14 hotels and 2 conference centers, as well as at locations in Greenwich and Stamford and at the Westchester County Visitors Bureau, which recommends his services.</p>
        <p>''I've taken people from Egypt, India, Germany, France, you name it,'' he said. ''And I take plenty of Americans. My biggest thrill is when I take someone from Iowa, and they say, about some great spot in Manhattan, 'Oh, I've heard of it, but I've never really known anything about it before.' My tour is like a little tale, a story of the city.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas's love of driving, a good sense of direction and an appreciation of New York City combine to make him perfect for his profession, he believes.</p>
        <p>After growing up in New Rochelle and majoring in communications at Ithaca College, he formed a band called the Other Brothers, ''a play on words, because I was the other brother -- we were four whites and me.'' They played jazz, rock and fusion, and traveled extensively around Manhattan, the Bronx and Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>As a teenager, he had also worked at the Black Spectrum Theater Company in St. Albans, Queens -- ''that's how I learned Queens.''</p>
        <p>To this day he maintains that he had -- and still has -- the best of both worlds living in the suburbs. ''I have all the trees and grass I need, and I'm highly mobile -- I can be in the city anytime I want.''</p>
        <p>The first seeds for the tour service were planted when he was a teenager. ''Here I am, doing all this driving, got my license at 16, then the music thing happens,'' he recalled. ''My sister goes off to college and brings friends home on breaks and asks me to take them down to the city. The West Side Highway was all elevated at the time. You could go down on the West, wrap around the tip, then come back up the East Side. I remember, I wrote it down on a little piece of paper: that maybe this was something I could do professionally.''</p>
        <p>In 1984, he opened a stationery store in the Vernon Woods section of Mount Vernon, which he sold in 1991. Also in 1984, he began driving limousines and vans for a small transportation company. Eleven years later, he decided to go into the tour business for himself.</p>
        <p>It took months of preparation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas wrote a script describing the more than 100 spots he planned to highlight: some obvious, like Rockefeller Center and the Empire State Building; some, not so obvious, like Strivers' Row, the strip of elegant brownstones in Harlem where luminaries of literature and music had lived.</p>
        <p>Then he got a Rand McNally pocket atlas, for page-by-page detailing of the city, and a stack of graph paper and wrote out, in chart form, every turn, every light, every mile of his route. This was followed by hundreds of practice runs, street by street.</p>
        <p>''It's one thing on paper, but it has to prove out on the road,'' he said. ''When you're doing it, when you're actually out there giving a tour, it's all about being smooth, not gunnin' and runnin'.''</p>
        <p>He took the New York City tour guide license exam, a four-hour, multiple-choice written test of one's knowledge of the city. He aced it. ''They'll show you a picture of, say, a part of a hotel and ask you to identify it. You cannot just say, 'That's the Plaza.' You have to say, 'That's the side door of the Plaza,' and then tell them which side door on which street.''</p>
        <p>As for the future, he envisions New York by Night expanding into a full-time operation. (He now works 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the security department at International Business Machines in Hawthorne to supplement his income.)</p>
        <p>He would also like to see it grow into ''Boston by Night,'' ''Philadelphia by Night,'' ''Los Angeles by Night,'' and so forth.</p>
        <p>''I think I've found a niche that can be filled, and I'd love to make it bigger,'' he said. ''I believe all cities look great after dark. You don't need a reason or a season -- just show them a city at night.''</p>
