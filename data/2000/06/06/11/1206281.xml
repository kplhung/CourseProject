        <p>A company in Valencia, Calif., called 3D Systems makes a startlingly futuristic contraption that might best be described as a three-dimensional fax machine. Instead of spitting out a mere piece of paper, it produces an actual object. A ThermoJet office printer, working from a digital blueprint, squirts out precise drops of hot plastic to make the proper shape. The resulting object can be anything, a blender, say, or a cell phone, and ready in just hours. Sadly, you won't be able to make a milkshake with that blender or place a call on the phone, but the 3-D fax machine is prized by companies that do a lot of industrial design. It enables a group of people, spread out anywhere on the planet, to collaborate in a way that only recently would have required them to be in the same place.</p>
        <p>There is nothing new, of course, about people working together from remote locations. But the 3-D fax -- as well as devices like the holographic videophone described on Page 90 -- is a machine that suggests a new stage in the dismantling of the traditional company. With each technological leap, we move closer to the reality of a truly virtual conglomerate that has no headquarters, no shipping and warehouse departments, no infrastructure at all -- a company that is no more than the sum of its ever changing human parts.</p>

        <p>A company in Valencia, Calif., called 3D Systems makes a startlingly futuristic contraption that might best be described as a three-dimensional fax machine. Instead of spitting out a mere piece of paper, it produces an actual object. A ThermoJet office printer, working from a digital blueprint, squirts out precise drops of hot plastic to make the proper shape. The resulting object can be anything, a blender, say, or a cell phone, and ready in just hours. Sadly, you won't be able to make a milkshake with that blender or place a call on the phone, but the 3-D fax machine is prized by companies that do a lot of industrial design. It enables a group of people, spread out anywhere on the planet, to collaborate in a way that only recently would have required them to be in the same place.</p>
        <p>There is nothing new, of course, about people working together from remote locations. But the 3-D fax -- as well as devices like the holographic videophone described on Page 90 -- is a machine that suggests a new stage in the dismantling of the traditional company. With each technological leap, we move closer to the reality of a truly virtual conglomerate that has no headquarters, no shipping and warehouse departments, no infrastructure at all -- a company that is no more than the sum of its ever changing human parts.</p>
        <p>How will we get there from here? Michael Hammer, who runs his own management education and research firm, is an evangelist of the virtual-company movement, and he sees signs of it everywhere. One of his favorite case studies is the network technology giant Cisco Systems. Cisco is essentially a research and development company that happens to also have a powerful sales force. But what is particularly interesting about Cisco is what it doesn't do. The Internet routers the company sells are assembled by an independent manufacturer from parts provided by a separate supplier. Another company oversees the whole process, tracks inventory and ensures that the order is shipped to the customer. It is getting to the point where products that Cisco sells may never be seen or touched by an actual Cisco employee.</p>
        <p>Back in 1992, an ex-Intel vice president named William Davidow was the co-author of ''The Virtual Corporation,'' in which he predicted that the flow of electronic information would enable companies to completely decentralize themselves. Most functions could be spun out on their own -- product development, manufacturing, inventory management, sales and returns. At the time, much of what he wrote was dismissed as hype and wishful thinking. Since then, however, his venture capital firm, Mohr, Davidow Ventures, has made major investments in companies like Agile Software and Datasweep that produce software to help companies evolve into virtual entities. ''So much of what we see in the business-to-business Internet space is about having the ability to coordinate relationships between different entities,'' Davidow says. ''That's going to have tremendous impact. The Internet dramatically reduces the cost of carrying on a lot of functions outside a firm.''</p>
        <p>The model that business futurists like to hold up is the movie industry. When you see a blockbuster at the multiplex, it says Sony or Paramount in big letters, but that name tells you almost nothing about who actually made the movie. In Hollywood, nearly everything is contracted out -- the casting, the costumes, the craft services -- and when the movie is done, everybody disperses to go work on whatever they've got lined up next. Many different kinds of goods and services may end up being produced in the same manner. ''In the future, when I order something over the Web, the brand isn't going to be as important as getting what I want,'' says Tom Sears, director of product marketing for PTC, a maker of Internet software. ''And that product will actually be provided by a big group of companies who come together almost in real time to get me what I need.''</p>
        <p>What this all means is that boundaries in the business world -- company to company, company to employee, company to consumer -- will blur, especially when machines like the 3-D printer trickle down to the consumer, which isn't so far off. The same 3-D printer that cost $100,000 a few years ago is now half that price, and in 10 years, it may go for less than $1,000. Meanwhile, a three-dimensional printer developed at M.I.T. and manufactured by Z Corporation is now able to produce objects in multiple colors, and researchers are working on a more advanced machine that can fuse powdered material into actual working components. Combine technologically evolved 3-D printers in the home with high-bandwidth Internet connections, and the customer of a virtual corporation could easily become a part of it.</p>
