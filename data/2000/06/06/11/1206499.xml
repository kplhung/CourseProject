      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>TradeOut.com, an online marketplace for excess inventory, is less than two years old, but it has already outgrown its headquarters in Ardsley and is moving to offices three times as large in Valhalla. The company, formed in 1998, has 220 employees, of whom 150 will move to the new offices this summer.</p>
        <p>''We outgrew our current space really fast,'' said Dermott Ryan, vice president of marketing. ''We were looking for a place with the ability to expand, given the company's growth from one to 220 employees in a year and a half.''</p>

        <p>''We outgrew our current space really fast,'' said Dermott Ryan, vice president of marketing. ''We were looking for a place with the ability to expand, given the company's growth from one to 220 employees in a year and a half.''</p>
        <p>The company received an incentive package of up to $700,000 from the Westchester County Office of Economic Development. ''After discussions with the county, we determined that it would be best to stay in Westchester,'' Mr. Ryan said.</p>
