        <p>THE year was 1968. It was a time of teenage rebellion, sexual revolution and protest. So when Jane Shmerler and John Masius were suspended from Scarsdale High School, what was their crime?</p>
        <p>Going out for a hamburger.</p>
        <p>It doesn't seem like a big deal. But it is a story with legs. It plays itself out on the screen and on the pages of popular novels. Stay with me on this.</p>
        <p>Scarsdale High was a closed campus in 1968, and students were not allowed to leave the grounds. But it was spring. It was Jane and John's senior year. They had already received college acceptance letters. And they were hungry. So they borrowed a friend's turquoise Buick Riviera and drove to the Heathcote deli for lunch.</p>
        <p>When they returned, they saw what many Scarsdale High alumni still remember as an intimidating sight -- Dean Stefan Corbin, in his short-sleeve shirt, arms folded across his chest, waiting for them in the parking lot.</p>
        <p>''He said: 'You. You. To the dean's office,' '' recalled Jane Shmerler, now Jane Heller. ''I had Dean Fitzgerald who was the strictest. If she caught you with a short skirt, she made you change -- she had long skirts in her office. They suspended us, and then Dean Fitzgerald said, 'I'm going to call your college and tell them what you're really like.' And they called our parents.''</p>
        <p>Despite their indiscretion, Ms. Heller and Mr. Masius went on to post-graduate lives that would make Scarsdale High proud. Ms. Heller, who graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Rochester, is the author of seven successful novels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Masius, an Emmy award winning television writer and producer, is the creator of ''Providence'' on NBC and ''Touched by an Angel'' on CBS.</p>
        <p>Ms. Heller has made her life in Stuart, Fla., and Mr. Masius lives in Southern California. But they have remained friends and can't seem to leave their Scarsdale days behind.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Heller read about Mr. Masius's latest show, she sent him a note wishing him good luck. Imagine her surprise, then, when she watched an episode of ''Providence'' and found her high school hijinks revealed.</p>
        <p>''I hear the main character in the show talking to a character who is a troubled teen, and this girl says to her, 'Well, Dr. Hanson, isn't there anything you've done that you've been ashamed of?' '' Ms. Heller said. ''And she says, 'As a matter of fact, my friend Jane Shmerler and I were suspended from high school.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Masius, who then had his character tell of getting in trouble with a friend's car, said that dropping his old classmate's name into the show was his way of staying in touch.</p>
        <p>''It was just my way of saying hi,'' Mr. Masius said. ''When you do TV shows, you dredge up a lot of stuff from your past. I was writing a little history for the lead character, and honestly I used Jane's name because I had gotten in trouble with her.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Masius said he had used many names from Scarsdale in the shows he has written.</p>
        <p>''The first 'St. Elsewhere' I wrote, I named a kid after someone I went to high school with, Tommy Duran,'' Mr. Masius said. ''It's hard to come up with names. I've been doing this for over 20 years, and I've referred to lots of people, some that took it well, some that didn't.'' He has also been on the receiving end -- one of his old writing partners named a murderer for Mr. Masius on the second episode of ''Homicide.''</p>
        <p>After seeing her past revealed on prime time, Ms. Heller called Mr. Masius and said: ''You blew my cover on national television. Now you owe me.''</p>
        <p>Amends were made in a very Hollywood way. On this season's finale of ''Providence,'' Mr. Masius had the main character's younger brother, Robby, sitting at the bar where he works, reading and chuckling over Ms. Heller's latest novel. The camera lingers long enough for the audience to get a good look at the book, titled -''Name Dropping.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Heller, of course, was pleased. She is about to start a publicity tour for ''Name Dropping,'' which is about two women with the same name whose lives become hopelessly entangled.</p>
        <p>But now the ball is back in Ms. Heller's court. The next lob to Mr. Masius is in the manuscript she has just completed for a book called ''Female Intelligence,'' to be published in the spring of 2001. In it, Ms. Heller has a character tell the heroine, ''Oh, I bet you sit in your house and watch 'Touched by an Angel' and sob.'' The heroine responds icily, ''I never watched 'Touched by an Angel.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Masius will no doubt be back with a public retort. ''Providence'' is about going home again and resuming relationships with family and friends. In a way, life for these two Scarsdale High alumni is imitating art.</p>
        <p>''I love that you can have a friend from high school, grow up, grow apart, live your life, and then, years later, have that friend back,'' Ms. Heller said. ''I have really enjoyed my renewed communication with John. It feels like a wacky game of Ping-Pong. We're having a lot of fun with it.''</p>
