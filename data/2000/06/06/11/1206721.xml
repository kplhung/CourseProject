        <p>New York Yankees reportedly will sign pitcher Dwight Gooden (M)</p>

        <p>Dwight Gooden has already been traded by the Astros and released by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays this season, but the Yankees have seen enough to want him. They are expected to announce today that they are signing the 35-year-old Gooden to a minor league contract.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, is probably behind the move, for he and Gooden have maintained a good relationship even though the pitcher left the team after the 1997 season -- expressing some anger at Manager Joe Torre on his way out.

        <p>Dwight Gooden has already been traded by the Astros and released by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays this season, but the Yankees have seen enough to want him. They are expected to announce today that they are signing the 35-year-old Gooden to a minor league contract.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, is probably behind the move, for he and Gooden have maintained a good relationship even though the pitcher left the team after the 1997 season -- expressing some anger at Manager Joe Torre on his way out. Gooden has worked out at the Yankees' minor league facility in Tampa, Fla., in the off-season, occasionally running into Steinbrenner.</p>
        <p>Gooden, who became a star in his 11 years with the Mets (1984-94), has a 190-110 career record.</p>
        <p>Before the Devil Rays released Gooden last month, he went 2-3 with a 6.86 earned run average, surrendering 53 hits, 36 runs (31 earned) and 23 walks in 40 2/3 innings. He also allowed a whopping 15 home runs.</p>
        <p>It is expected that Gooden will be assigned to Class AAA Columbus, where he will try to show enough to work his way back to the majors. Gooden will be working with a standard minor league deal, for about $10,000 per month. And if he does rebound to the majors, then his emergence might make it easier for the Yankees to deal one of their major league pitchers, such as Ramiro Mendoza, in a trade for a hitter.</p>
        <p>But Gooden has a long way to go: it was apparent when the Yankees faced him in May that he was short on stuff and needed to make major adjustments to regain his status as a viable contributor.</p>
        <p>Cubs' Scouts Watching</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner did not attend yesterday's 13-5 victory over the Mets, and he left the Stadium in the middle of the Yanks' 12-2 loss on Friday. If the Yankees had lost today, it might have only served to heighten his and his team's interest in a superstar outfielder.</p>
        <p>The Yankees and Mets have had cursory trade talks with the Chicago Cubs about the outfielder Sammy Sosa. Cubs scouts are currently combing the Yankees' farm system, preparing for the possibility they may decide to deal Sosa and ask the Yankees for a ransom in talent, such as the top prospect Alfonso Soriano, Class AA outfielder Jackson Melian and others. Sosa would not be a perfect fit for the Yankees -- he is a right-handed free swinger who strikes out a lot and his salary would make him their fourth player earning $10 million or more.</p>
