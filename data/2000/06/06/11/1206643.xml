        <p>Kobe Bryant left the Staples Center on crutches Friday night, unable to put much weight on his swollen and sprained left ankle. With one All-Star shelved, the Achilles' heel in Shaquille O'Neal's game was beginning to throb, too.</p>
        <p>The heavenly center -- and hellish foul-shooter -- went to the line a record 39 times, missing 21. Purist that he is, Larry Bird had said he would not resort to fouling O'Neal intentionally just to stay in the game. But this was too good to believe.</p>
        <p>Bryant's misfortune and O'Neal's misfires had given the Indiana Pacers a new lease in Game 2 of the National Basketball Association finals, a chance to return home to Indianapolis for Games 3, 4 and 5 of the series with hope against the Los Angeles Lakers and their indomitable center.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was working,'' Rik Smits said. ''For a while, anyway.''</p>
        <p>Until O'Neal made 9 of 16 free throws in the fourth quarter, found an open teammate underneath the basket for a game-deciding 3-point play in the final minute and delivered another 40-point knockout performance. There went the Hack-a-Shaq, the strategy going down as hard as the Pacers in a 111-104 loss that left Reggie Miller and the Eastern Conference champions in an 0-2 hole. Bryant, who is listed as day to day, does not appear healthy enough to play in Game 3 on Sunday night at Conseco Fieldhouse, but it may not matter the way O'Neal and his role players played in the 21-year-old guard's absence on Friday.</p>
        <p>''When Kobe went out, we felt that, you know, we had to pick it up,'' said O'Neal, who had 24 rebounds and is averaging 21.5 in the finals. ''So, I took it upon myself to try to get in deep position and take the high-percentage shots.''</p>
        <p>When Bryant fell awkwardly to the floor in the first quarter after he came down on Jalen Rose's foot, the building went dead quiet with concern. O'Neal, Glen Rice and Ron Harper soon alleviated it.</p>
        <p>With Bryant out, the other Laker starters seemed liberated by the opportunity. Glen Rice and Ron Harper each scored 21 points; Rice hit the bomb with aplomb, making 5 of 6 3-point shots; Harper sneaked through the lane for driving layups, hitting 8 of 12 shots for a season high.</p>
        <p>Bryant's X-rays were negative, and the injury was diagnosed as a moderate sprain. But Bryant's availability for Game 3 seemed doubtful, at best.</p>
        <p>''I've had sprained ankles before,'' he said. ''I thought I was going to get up, shake it off and keep playing. It just kept getting worse and worse. As far as Sunday goes, the good thing is we have a cushion now, being up, 2-0. So it's not a do-or-die situation for me to play on Sunday. If I'm ready to go, if I can walk and put pressure on it, I'll be ready to play.''</p>
        <p>Since the 2-3-2 finals format began in 1985, no home team has won all three middle games.</p>
        <p>''I felt like when Kobe went out of the game, if we could've found a way to put some pressure on them and get them down around 10 points, they would have gotten nervous,'' Rose said. ''We weren't able to put that strong thrust against what they were bringing toward us in order for them to start doubting themselves.''</p>
        <p>O'Neal, as usual, was to blame. He set records for most free throws attempted in a game, burying the old record of 24 set by Bob Pettit in 1958. He also shot more free throws in each half -- 17 in the first half and 22 in the second half -- than Bill's Russell's previous record of 15 for a half set in the 1961 finals.</p>
        <p>He also became only the fourth player in league history to score 40 points in consecutive games. After his 43-point eruption in Game 1, he is averaging 41.5 points in the two games. Michael Jordan averaged a finals record 41.0 points over six games against Phoenix in 1993.</p>
        <p>The way the Pacers are putting him on the line, O'Neal might just surpass Jordan's mark. But with each intentional foul, controversy arose over whether or not the strategy was good for the game.</p>
        <p>''Well, I don't worry about ratings,'' Bird said. ''I'm trying to win a ballgame right now. Whatever it takes to win a ballgame, we're going to do it. If it takes a four-hour game, that's what we're going to do.''</p>
        <p>The game lasted 2 hours 55 minutes and had a fourth quarter that included 45 free throws and lasted 56 minutes.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a fan of Hack-a-Shaq,'' said Miller, who finished with 21 points but scored only 8 points in the final three and a half quarters. ''I like to play straight-up, old-style basketball. When I first saw it in the Portland series, when they were down 15 or 16, I didn't understand it. But if you're in the game and you've got 6 or 7 minutes left and you're shooting free throws like he was shooting tonight, then I could see it. But I'm not a big fan of it, no.''</p>
        <p>O'Neal said: ''Like I said in the last series, I think it's just a total respect for my game. My father was in the stands tonight, so I was able to look at him. He told me to relax, take my time, just play, and I did that.''</p>
        <p>The Pacers were not overwhelmed, holding a lead of 67-64 in the third quarter. And for whatever Miller and Smits (a paltry 2-for-6 shooting in 16 foul-prone minutes) did not give them, Austin Croshere (career-high 24 points) and Rose (30 points in 48 minutes) found a way to get to the basket and draw contact.</p>
        <p>But the lasting image was of O'Neal, either chipping paint off the front iron or getting the ball to nestle into the net, concentrating as if he had $1 million riding on a quiz-show question. And when the game was in the balance at 99-96 with 58.8 seconds left, he found Robert Horry underneath for a reverse layup and an eventual 3-point play.</p>
        <p>''With Kobe going down, we had a golden opportunity tonight that slipped through our fingers,'' Miller said. ''But what can you say? The guy goes back-to-back 40. You got to give him credit.''</p>
        <p>Like Game 1, O'Neal looked so much bigger than most of the Pacers on Friday night, like an oversized child at recess whose classmates could not get the ball out of his hands. In the second half, he was called for a very questionable flagrant foul on 5-foot-11-inch Travis Best.</p>
        <p>Replays showed that Best had initiated contact on the layup try with a forearm and that O'Neal's block, which sent the guard to the floor, was clean. But perhaps the image of a 7-1, 330-pound man colliding with the smallest player on the court makes officials see things that are not there.</p>
        <p>''I don't understand the rules,'' O'Neal said. ''Sometimes they grabbed me and took me to the ground. I'm not a little guy in a sports car that runs into a brick wall. But I guess I'm big and I can take it.''</p>
        <p>His team is up, 2-0, and he is averaging 41.5 points a game. O'Neal will take it.</p>
