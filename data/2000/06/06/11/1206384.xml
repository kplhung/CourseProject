        <p>Two major exhibitions make museum-going on the Island a must this summer. Today, the Nassau County Museum of Art opens ''Dance, Dance, Dance,'' a visual exploration of the connections between art and dance. Paintings, sculptures, drawings and graphics, photographs, videos and costumes from France, Russia, the United States and different cultures, trace the relationship between art and dance from the late-19th century to the present time. Included are works by such Impressionist and School of Paris masters as Degas, Lautrec, Matisse, and Picasso; American Ash-Can School artists like Davies, Glackens and Marsh; photographers from Steichen to Mapplethorpe; and contemporary artists like David Hockney, Larry Rivers and Jamie Wyeth. Along with ''Fabulous Jewels,'' a display of jewelry created by Tiffany, Lalique and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, the show runs through Sept. 17 at the museum off Northern Boulevard in Roslyn Harbor (516) 484-9337.</p>

        <p>Two major exhibitions make museum-going on the Island a must this summer.

Paintings, sculptures, drawings and graphics, photographs, videos and costumes from France, Russia, the United States and different cultures, trace the relationship between art and dance from the late-19th century to the present time.

        <p>While the ''Dance'' show was created locally, Guild Hall on Saturday brings in a traveling show, ''American Impressionism: Treasures From the Smithsonian American Art Museum.'' Just one of eight Smithsonian ''Treasures to Go'' exhibitions touring the country through 2002, this exhibition makes its debut in East Hampton, the only metropolitan New York stop on a five-museum agenda.  The 52 works featured include Whistler's ''Valparaiso Harbor,'' Cassatt's ''Caress,'' six major canvasses by Childe Hassam, considered by many to be America's foremost Impressionist, and other paintings by such other leaders of the school as Chase, Prendergast, Robinson, Tanner and Thayer. Running through July 30 at the museum on Main Street, the exhibition opens with a reception and gallery talk from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. Saturday, but there's a big-ticket preview and reception at 6 p.m. Friday (631) 324-0806.</p>
        <p>Flower Power</p>
        <p>With the results of weeks of early spring pampering beginning to show, private gardens on the Island on Saturday open their gates to help various groups raise funds. On the East End, garden fans (or the just plain curious) have three choices: an ''artistic eye'' characterizes the seven gardens from Bridgehampton to Amagansett, belonging to painters, potters, photographers, collectors, curators and an art writer, singled out on the Animal Rescue Fund of the Hamptons' ''Art World Gardens in the Hamptons Tour'' from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (631) 537-0400. Ten gardens on both the North and South Forks are featured in the Garden Conservancy's ''Open Day,'' with proceeds being shared by the conservancy and such local charities as the Committee for Sag Harbor's Old Burying Gound Fund and the East End Hospice (888) 842-2442.</p>
        <p>In the Sayville-Bayport area, the Bay Area Friends of the Fine Arts offers ''A Little Garden Music,'' with live musical entertainment at all seven gardens open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. (631) 589-7343. Finally, as it usually does, the Parrish Art Museum begins its annual ''Landscape Pleasures'' benefit with a symposium at 9 a.m. at the museum on Job's Lane in Southampton. The speakers include Tovah Martin, the writer-editor, on ''Garden Whimsy;'' Jamaica Kincaid, the novelist, on ''How I Became a Gardener,'' and Dan Pearson, the British designer, on ''Working with Nature Not Against It.'' Lunch, book signings and a cocktail reception complete Saturday's events. Then, next Sunday six gardens in Southampton, including, ''Linden,'' the estate of Lloyd H. Smith which was designed in 1915 by Grosvenor Atterbury, who created the original American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, will be open to visitors from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. (631) 283-2118.</p>
        <p>Like your flowers in a bowl? There's something for you, too; especially if you favor roses. Today, from 2 to 5 p.m., the Long Island Rose Society holds its 44th Annual Show at Planting Fields Arboretum in Oyster Bay (516) 922-9200. Come Saturday and members of the Southampton Rose Society show their stuff from 2 to 4 p.m. at the United Methodist Church on North Main Street (631) 283-7863, while the Garden Club of Shelter Island has ''What Is So Rare as a Day in June?'' its standard flower show, from 2 to 5:30 p.m. in the American Legion Hall on Route 114 (631) 749-0024.</p>
        <p>Historic Church</p>
        <p>Tracing its origin back to a meetinghouse built in 1675 near the junction of River and Moriches Roads on land donated by Richard Smith, the founder of Smithtown, the First Presbyterian Church of Smithtown celebrates its 325th anniversary today. A family-style picnic on the Village Green, the front lawn of the church on East Main Street, at 4 p.m. marks the event, followed by a historic pageant in the Parish Hall at 6 p.m. The pageant will touch upon such events as the move of the meetinghouse to its present site in 1750, the purchase of the 442-pound church bell in 1850 for $156.48 and the designation of the church as a National Historical Landmark in 1977 (631) 265-5151.</p>
        <p>Musical Benefits</p>
        <p>Since ''music hath charms to sooth the savage breast,'' it figures that it can also raise funds for worthy causes. At least some local and New York City charities are banking on it Saturday with three concerts. In the ''17th Annual Jazz Festival Concert'' to benefit Advocates for the Autistic,  Arvell Shaw and the Louis Armstrong Legacy Band, joined by Barbara Lea, vocalist, and Dick Sudhalter, the trumpeteer-writer, with Eddie Locke on drums, Bill Crow, bass, and James Chirillo, guitar, perform at 8 p.m. at Five Towns College in Dix Hills. Donations are $20 a ticket (631) 766-5190.</p>
        <p>While that toll is modest, the two entries in East Hamptons request more; especially for gala receptions connected to the concerts. ''Songs for a Summer Night,'' with such opera singers as Frances Ginsberg, soprano; Hilda Harris, mezzo-soprano; and Vahan Khanzadian, tenor, asks $100 ($25 for partly restricted views) for the East End Hospice. Following the concert at 8 p.m. at St. Luke's Church on James Lane, there is a reception for $500 and $1,000 patrons at the Point Restaurant (631) 324-2169. Finally, in ''Pure Motion,'' dancers from such companies at the American Ballet Theater, the Dance Theater of Harlem, Momix, and the Lar Luvovitch and Paul Taylor Dance Companies will appear for the Community Research Initiative on AIDS and Dancers Responding to AIDS. Before the performance at 8 p.m. at the local high school on Long Lane (tickets $35 and $50), there is a reception at the ocean front Marcus estate at 6 p.m. for $200 and $500 donors (212) 840-0770.</p>
        <p>Atlantis Arrives</p>
        <p>Moving the legendary city that perhaps sank to the bottom of the Atlantic 12,000 years ago to eastern Long Island, the Atlantis Marine World opens on Thursday on East Main Street in Riverhead. Among the 80 exhibits completed in phase one of the site's development are the largest live coral reef in the United States, a 120,000-gallon shark tank, an Amazon rain forest and outdoor coliseum seating for sea lion shows  (631) 208-9200.</p>
        <p>Movie Time</p>
        <p>When Richard Brown, the movie maven, takes to a stage he attracts audiences willing to gamble on his product sight unseen. Audiences never really know what new films he will screen and discuss or which ''celebrity'' will sit for interviews. This summer, Dr. Brown comes to the Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center on Main Street where on Friday at 7:30 p.m. he starts a three-part series; future installments are on June 30 and July 16 (631) 288-1500.</p>
        <p>Free Choices</p>
        <p>TODAY -- In its annual ''Pops Concert'' at 7:30 p.m. at St. Joseph's College in Patchogue, the Bay Area Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, joined by Melody Alesi, soprano, and David Zimmerman, tenor, features highlights from Italian opera (631) 589-7343.</p>
