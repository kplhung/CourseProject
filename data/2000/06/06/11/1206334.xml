        <p>FOR 20 years or so, the composer Ned Rorem went around grimly asserting that the art song was languishing, especially the American art song. As he saw it, American singers of recent decades, lured by the potential for fame and fortune in opera, were giving only token attention to song. Nor were current singers cultivating relationships with living composers of songs, as did many important American artists of earlier generations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rorem is famous for his ''everything is going to hell'' pronouncements, but this one was hard to discount. Although he won a Pulitzer Prize for an orchestral work, Mr. Rorem is arguably America's foremost composer of songs. His catalog includes more than 500 songs, and at 76, he does not seem close to stopping.</p>
        <p>But last month at the 92nd Street Y on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Mr. Rorem admitted that he had been quite wrong. While he was predicting the demise of the American art song, he said, a whole generation of song composers emerged right under his nose. Important singers had been commissioning songs and performing them prominently for appreciative audiences.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the concert at which Mr. Rorem made these comments presented the premieres of song cycles by three noted members of the new generation, Ricky Ian Gordon, Daron Hagen and John Musto, and concluded with a performance of Mr. Rorem's 1969 song cycle ''War Scenes'' by the baritone Kurt Ollmann and the composer at the piano. Moreover, this was just one of an unlinked series of recent song recitals in New York, by Renee Fleming, Susan Graham, Sanford Sylvan and Barbara Bonney. Taken together, along with an Alice Tully Hall concert devoted to songs of the San Francisco-based composer Jake Heggie, they offered a de facto citywide festival of new American songs.</p>
        <p>They also provided a chance to assess the character and quality of American songs today. And here the news was more problematic. Among the current generation are talented composers with real understanding of how to write for the voice and with interesting tastes in texts. Almost all are pianists who can ably accompany singers performing their works.</p>
        <p>But in courting singers and audiences, many of these same composers employ a warmed-over neo-Romantic musical language and borrow heavily from pop and musical theater genres in an attempt to give their works an appealing American hipness. The resulting songs can seem dated on arrival. Few of the composers have truly distinctive, confident compositional voices. Many of the songs are pleasing to hear but terribly slight.</p>
        <p>What is going on? Why should a group of essentially conservative song composers suddenly be in such demand by audiences and singers?</p>
        <p>Perhaps the pendulum swing that has long been noted in other areas of classical music is finally affecting the art song. A backlash has set in after a long period during which composers who wrote in atonal, hard-edged contemporary styles alienated many singers and song fanciers. And song buffs, though generally the most literate of listeners, have seldom been musically adventurous sorts. Because of the nature of the singing voice, and because the whole point of a song is to support and transmit words through music, a certain degree of directness and accessibility has always been valued in the genre. Early in the 20th century, American composers responded in kind to the most radical trends of European modernism in their instrumental works but not, typically, in their songs.</p>
        <p>The first great flourishing of American art songs came in the years between the wars, when Aaron Copland was trying to rally a generation of fellow composers to the task of creating a contemporary style that would somehow be recognizably American. Countless fine songs were written by composers like Paul Bowles, Ernst Bacon, Virgil Thomson, Quincy Porter, Samuel Barber and David Diamond as well as by Theodore Chanler, who is sadly neglected today, and the remarkable Israel Citkowitz, who is virtually forgotten.</p>
        <p>The current song composers clearly see themselves as successors in this tradition. The problem is that their predecessors set a standard for originality and elegance that is seldom met today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon, for example, has won popularity with audiences and the loyalty of important singers for his many songs that blend breezy, voice-friendly melodies with milky, pop-tinged harmonies. But his work could be seen as an object lesson in the dangers of crossover: music that tries to bridge popular and concert styles. Perhaps his best-known song, one of Ms. Fleming's favorite encore pieces, is a setting of ''Will There Really Be a Morning?'' by Emily Dickinson. Mr. Gordon's lushly lyrical tune, in which every foursquare phrase ends with a prolonged high note (ideal for Ms. Fleming's sumptuous upper range), and the pop-ballad-like accompaniment combine to make Dickinson's acute, unflinching poetic reflections seem like sentimental pop lyrics.</p>
        <p>IN a revealing interview in Opera News recently, Mr. Gordon described how he typically composes a song. Often, he said, ''it's like I become emotionally ready to write it, and it explodes out of me.'' In terms of ''any kind of intellectual process,'' he added, ''that's just not me.'' He is not a composer who plans ''the architecture of a piece,'' he said, ''like John Corigliano.''</p>
        <p>So John Corigliano, who is not exactly Elliott Carter, is Mr. Gordon's idea of an intellectual, architectural composer? Songs apparently do explode out of Mr. Gordon. When Ms. Fleming was planning the recital she gave in February, devoted to settings of Dickinson poems, she asked Mr. Gordon to send her something. Before she knew it, she said at the time, she received an entire cycle of new Dickinson settings in the mail. In the second of Ms. Fleming's New York recitals, she performed another new work by Mr. Gordon, a setting of a monologue from Tony Kushner's ''Angels in America,'' which indicated he could write music with some punch to it. But he should probably slow down and compose less. Often, his piano parts are not appreciably more interesting than, say, the improvised playing of a tasteful, jazz-trained cocktail pianist.</p>
        <p>It's fashionable today to applaud creative artists who blur categories and blend elements of popular and serious traditions. But there is no inherent value in doing so, and there are a lot of pitfalls, as a telltale moment in Ms. Fleming's second recital made clear.</p>
        <p>To end the program, the composer Andre Previn accompanied her in the premiere of ''The Giraffes Go to Hamburg,'' his setting for voice, flute and piano of an excerpt from a memoir of Isak Dinesen. Mr. Previn turned the text into a compelling musical monologue. The work's harmonic language was effective if not particularly striking.</p>
        <p>Then, for encores, Mr. Previn switched into his jazz pianist mode and improvised accompaniments to songs by Ellington, Arlen and Van Heusen, which Ms. Fleming, who used to sing with jazz combos in college, performed winningly. Mr. Previn's playing showed incomparable taste and imagination. The precision and pungency of the harmony revealed a keen ear at play.</p>
        <p>So what happens to that keen ear when Mr. Previn composes his ''serious'' vocal works? Surely, the elegance of his jazz playing comes from his knowing the style intimately. Paradoxically, by working within a tradition, Mr. Previn ''composes'' more boldly.</p>
        <p>AS a critic, one wants to support the composers who have embraced the art song genre anew. Mr. Musto, Mr. Hagen and Mr. Heggie are serious and gifted musicians clearly enthralled with the singing voice and engaged by the practice of setting words to music. Mr. Heggie works especially hard to tailor his songs to the specific qualities of the artists who sing them. This diligence has won him powerful supporters, many of whom he first met while working in the press office at the San Francisco Opera.</p>
        <p>''The Faces of Love'' is the rather saccharine title of an RCA Red Seal recording of Mr. Heggie's songs, steeped in Ravel and Barber, performed by such vocal luminaries as Ms. Fleming, Sylvia McNair, Jennifer Larmore and, his greatest admirer, Frederica von Stade. ''Jake Heggie is my Mozart,'' Ms. von Stade gushes in a quotation that Mr. Heggie's publicists have widely circulated. Mr. Heggie and his backers understand that star performers, not composers, hold the power in the classical-music industry. On the covers of the three published volumes of his ''Faces of Love'' songs, the names of the singers, ''as heard on the RCA Red Seal CD,'' are listed in print the same size as Mr. Heggie's.</p>
        <p>Yet for all the pleasure Mr. Musto, Mr. Hagen and Mr. Heggie have given singers and audiences, there is an eerie similarity to their work: each writes in some variation of a pungently chromatic, sometimes modal, neo-Romantic harmonic idiom, with varying echoes of pop songs, or outbursts of chunky cluster chords, or even brief fragments of tone rows, depending on how intense the particular song is supposed to be. The significant differences in their work come down to their choices of texts and the degrees to which their vocal lines showcase the specific voices of intended interpreters.</p>
        <p>For comparison, song enthusiasts should check out a New World Records disc, ''But Yesterday Is Not Today: The American Art Song, 1927-72,'' first released in 1977, which includes insightful liner notes by Mr. Rorem. On it, the great baritone Donald Gramm sings songs by Chanler, Bowles and John Duke, and the soprano Bethany Beardslee sings songs by Copland, Sessions, Chanler, Barber, Citkowitz and, finally, Robert Helps, who is also her pianist here. The music is stunning in its variety and excellence.</p>
        <p>Though Chanler, who died at 59 in 1961, sometimes showed questionable taste in texts, he was a master of musical economy. ''Chanler's genius of brevity was extreme,'' Mr. Rorem writes. ''No one in history, not Dowland or Satie or Webern, ever more convincingly carried a hearer from doubt to heartbreak to resolution in a span of five bars.''</p>
        <p>Citkowitz's Five Songs From ''Chamber Music'' (1930), settings of texts by James Joyce, are a revelation. Although he died at 65 in 1974, Citkowitz had a mysteriously short composing career. His songs are few but extraordinary. While his contemporaries were working in various strains of a harmonic language that has come to be called Coplandesque, Citkowitz was trying something harder. His piano accompaniments are highly linear and contrapuntal; the voice and piano lines mingle daringly. The music has an almost abstract quality. And the flecks of astringent harmony leap out at you.</p>
        <p>Another record that puts the current generation in context is a recital by the soprano Lucy Shelton on Koch International, presenting the complete songs for voice and piano by Stravinsky and Elliott Carter. Mr. Carter, who wrote his first opera at 90 (''What Next?,'' which received its premiere last year), has never been known as a vocal composer. But the songs from the 1940's performed here are scintillating. Imagine Copland's modal harmonies studded with feisty notes and threatening to burst at the seams with atonal riffs, and you will get some idea of what the music sounds like.</p>
        <p>A long work from 1994, ''Of Challenge and Love,'' on texts by John Hollander, finds Mr. Carter in his complex, knotty mature style. But the rigor of the idiom and the jagged vocal writing provide a refreshing break from the pandering neo-Romanticism that has become the style of choice.</p>
        <p>THE baritone Sanford Sylvan came to Weill Recital Hall recently with a new work by another young American, the Cuban-born Jorge Martin. ''The Glass Hammer: Scenes From Childhood Kept Against Forgetting,'' a 60-minute song cycle, sets 15 searing and painfully honest poems by Andrew Hudgins about his troubled youth as an Army brat in the Deep South with an abusive father. Mr. Sylvan's performance was a shattering tour de force. Yet, though Mr. Martin's music had tensile strength, declamatory sweep and often poignant lyricism, it did not always captivate the ear. Perhaps he lacks depth; or perhaps in this work he chose to ''illustrate'' the poems, in a sense, to keep the listener's attention focused on the words and the storytelling. Still, at a time when so many song composers are placating audiences, Mr. Martin's ambitious and challenging cycle stands out.</p>
        <p>Then, of course, there is Mr. Rorem. During the 1960's, when the most hard-edged atonal composers claimed intellectual primacy in American music, tonal composers were condescended to. Mr. Rorem, in particular, was treated by many peers as some derivative disciple of Poulenc.</p>
        <p>Yet ''War Scenes,'' Mr. Rorem's cycle on texts freely selected from Walt Whitman's diary of the Civil War, comes from that decade, and in retrospect, especially in the context of the program at the 92nd Street Y, the music seemed pungent, lean, spiky and utterly contemporary.</p>
        <p>Two recent recordings demonstrate the range of Mr. Rorem's achievement: the superb mezzo-soprano Susan Graham offers an entire Rorem program, 32 songs, on an Erato disc, with the pianist Malcolm Martineau. Every song -- even the most modest ones, like the ambling, tender setting of Robert Hillyer's ''Early in the Morning'' -- abounds in refinement and grace.</p>
        <p>Last year, New World released a two-disc album of ''Evidence of Things Not Seen,'' Mr. Rorem's self-described magnum opus, a concert-length cycle of 36 songs for four singers and piano. Poems and letters of 24 authors are arranged by the composer to create a text of narrative sweep dealing with themes of youthful optimism, coming of age, war, failed love, disillusionment, death and faith.</p>
        <p>The pianists Steven Blier and Michael Barrett, who direct the New York Festival of Song, which helped commission this cycle, perform it here with Mr. Ollmann, Monique McDonald, Dolores Ziegler and Rufus Miller. Each song is an intimate and masterfully shaped gem. But the entire work has the impact of an opera. This work affirms Mr. Rorem's place in the tradition.</p>
        <p>The general climate for American songs is more receptive than ever, and the current generation of song composers deserve credit for fostering it. That audiences are getting into the habit of hearing new songs is an important development. Now, it's up to audiences and singers to demand more challenging fare. And it's up to composers to work harder to provide it.</p>
