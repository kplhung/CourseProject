        <p>No wonder the Roman Catholic church in Rocksburg, Pa., is called Mother of Sorrows -- someone has to cry for the suffering souls in the depressed mill town where K. C.

        <p>No wonder the Roman Catholic church in Rocksburg, Pa., is called Mother of Sorrows -- someone has to cry for the suffering souls in the depressed mill town where K. C. Constantine sets his blue-collar crime novels. GRIEVANCE (Mysterious Press/Warner, $23.95) picks up the never-ending narrative of Rocksburg's decline with the murder of J. D. Lyon, C.E.O. of the local steel outfit that pulled up stakes and relocated to Brazil, tossing this company town into an economic sinkhole. Ruggiero (Rugs) Carlucci, the young police sergeant who recently took over the peacekeeping chores in this ruefully honest series, does his best to conduct a fair investigation. But he is driven to distraction by his mother's deteriorating mental state, and his work ethic is compromised by his compassion for the families whose lives were so casually destroyed by the murdered man.</p>
        <p>Carlucci gets an earful when he starts interviewing the plant foremen who were doubly betrayed -- dumped by the millowner and written off by the union. Challenged by one worker with a heart-wrenching beef against the world, he finds it all too easy to identify. ''All I'm sayin' is, I know him,'' he says to a hard-nosed state trooper. ''I look in his eyes, I'm lookin' in a mirror.'' The anguished voices of the broken people in this beat-up town would make a saint weep.</p>
        <p>In one of the most energetic adventures of her intrepid career, Elizabeth Peters's archaeologist sleuth, Amelia Peabody, finally has a pyramid to dig up. ''To excavate in the cemeteries of Giza was the culmination of a lifetime's dream,'' this incurable romantic exclaims at the outset of HE SHALL THUNDER IN THE SKY (Morrow, $25). But the year is 1915, and the winds of war are sweeping across the desert, bringing threats of an attack on the Suez Canal and stirring hostility toward the British community in Cairo. Try as they might to concentrate on their tomb excavations, Amelia and her Egyptologist husband, Radcliffe Emerson, a dashing fellow who is ''intoxicated by danger, spurred on by the need for action,'' are soon prowling the mean streets of Cairo in odd disguises, searching out spies and foreign agents.</p>
        <p>The tensions of the war add terrific urgency (and a surprising jolt of realism) to the escapist adventures of the excitable Emerson clan, which includes the couple's daredevil son, Ramses, who is involved in his own secret mission, and assorted nieces, nephews and friends who are also wrapped up in the huggermugger -- but not to the point of forsaking the glittering social life at Shepheard's Hotel. ''Aunt Amelia,'' one of these conspirators asks, ''does it ever occur to you that this family is a trifle eccentric?'' Well, yes, but in the nicest, most endearing ways.</p>
        <p>In his continuing campaign to bury the myth of Midwestern blandness, John Sandford opens his new police procedural, EASY PREY (Putnam, $25.95), with a kinky fashion shoot on a Mississippi River barge. The scene is so charged with erotic decadence (''It had this weird end-of-time feel to it'') that the orgiastic party following the photo shoot seems anticlimactic -- until the doped-up supermodel who set off the sexual sparks on the river barge is discovered strangled in a bedroom.</p>
        <p>Lucas Davenport, the manly Minneapolis cop in this broad-shouldered series, is unfazed by the exotic moral codes of the fashionistas. ''We've got incest, jealousy, drugs, love triangles,'' he says, sounding bored. ''You name it, we got it.'' But his hunting instinct kicks in when other members of the model's entourage also come to untimely ends, suggesting more devious motives and more than one killer.</p>
        <p>Although Lucas makes his own strong fashion statement (in clean jeans and woodsman's shirts, behind the wheel of a black Porsche), his smooth professional moves are the best feature of his style. A shrewd gamester who made his personal fortune designing computer games, he follows sound police procedures and devises one intricate ploy after another to draw out the killers -- all the while fending off three (count 'em, three) beauties who would love to run their fingers over his scars.</p>
        <p>Martyn Waites stands out in the crowded field of young British noir writers currently in competition for the most sour, cynical, hopeless, unrelentingly bleak vision of criminal injustice. CANDLELAND (Allison &amp; Busby/International Publishers Marketing, $26.95) is as sour, cynical, etc., as they come, with its shocking scenes of what happens to teenage runaways when they land on the streets of London. Some of these kids find their way to Candleland, a shelter characterized as ''a wasteland . . . the land of the missing and the dispossessed,'' but most of them fall prey to pimps and gangsters who misuse them in hideous ways, and a few wind up dead. Fearing the worst for his missing daughter, a burned-out Newcastle cop heads for London with a young journalist named Stephen Larkin, who handles all the dirty work and some of the heartache for him. Although the violence is so over-the-top that it deadens the impact the author intends, Waites recovers much of this lost ground with his bruised characters, raw-edged dialogue and extraordinary night vision.</p>
        <p>Patricia Hall's village mystery THE ITALIAN GIRL (St. Martin's Minotaur, $21.95) takes its sinuous style and moody tone from the lonely Yorkshire moors, but studiously avoids romanticizing its little corner of Bront country. One native son, a faded movie idol returned from Hollywood to star in a new version of ''Jane Eyre,'' vilifies his birthplace as ''bog and mountain and bitterly cold in winter.'' The town was even chillier to the family of an Italian prisoner of war who relocated there after World War II, and when the bones of their missing daughter are disinterred at a building site, all the old animosities are also exhumed. ''It's like a judgment, isn't it, the body coming back to haunt them,'' observes the sister of one of the local men who come under suspicion for the fateful murder. As the story moves grimly forward, staining Inspector Michael Thackeray and his live-in lover with its corruptive curse, Hall draws delicate parallels with the Bront novel, uncovering dreadful secrets in the attic and giving vent to the furies of guilt down below.</p>
