        <p>Another Life: A Memoir of Other People</p>
        <p>By Michael Korda. Delta, $14.95.</p>
        <p>A perpetually optimistic book editor recalls his many years at Simon &amp; Schuster and his encounters with nearly everybody who is anybody, from Richard Nixon to Joan Crawford. ''Korda's tone of voice is affectionate and urbane, his manner that of the accomplished raconteur who never spoils the story with a heavy-handed moral,'' Lewis Lapham wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>Layover</p>
        <p>By Lisa Zeidner. Perennial, $13.</p>
        <p>Claire Newbold is a successful middle-aged saleswoman who, after the death of her 3-year-old son and her husband's infidelity, simply refuses to come home one day. Instead, she embarks on an odyssey of lust, seduction, forbidden desire and furtive hotel hopping. ''The novel rocks with a lot of great, sexy scenes, in which Zeidner's fine writing is on glorious display,'' Karen Karbo wrote in the Book Review in 1999. ''With 'Layover,' Zeidner joins the ranks of Doris Lessing, Margaret Atwood and Fay Weldon, all of whom have written in the women-spiraling-into-madness genre.''</p>
        <p>Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation</p>
        <p>By Edward Chancellor. Plume, $13.95.</p>
        <p>The author employs ballads, newspaper articles and gossip in this tour of speculative manias, a long trail of wild dreams, burst bubbles and lost fortunes stretching back to the 17th century. Last year our reviewer, Adam Smith, praised the book's ''admirable scholarship.''</p>
        <p>Tipping the Velvet</p>
        <p>By Sarah Waters. Riverhead, $13.95.</p>
        <p>The heroine of this erotic first novel is a wide-eyed girl who falls for a music hall actress in late Victorian England. This infatuation leads to heartbreak and a harrowing (if ultimately redeemed) life as a cross-dresser and kept woman in the back alleys and elegant homes of London. ''If lesbian fiction is to reach a wider readership . . . Waters is just the person to carry the banner,'' Miranda Seymour wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>My Pilgrim's Progress: Media Studies, 1950-1998</p>
        <p>By George W. S. Trow. Vintage, $13.</p>
        <p>This book-length essay is not so much about media as it is a social history of the decline of patrician New York and the loss of authority once wielded by traditionally civilized people like the author. Trow is ''an inspired close reader of all the stuff we gloss, graze and glance at,'' Gerald Marzorati wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>The Sea Came in at Midnight</p>
        <p>By Steve Erickson. Perennial, $14.</p>
        <p>This apocalyptic novel revolves around a young girl with a twisted past who hooks up with an obsessive millennial freak; other plot lines involve a creator of improbable maps and an illicit trade in time capsules. ''The various stories mesh together at the level of verbal echo and poetic metaphor,'' Geoff Nicholson wrote here last year. ''Erickson also writes brilliantly sentence by sentence.''</p>
        <p>The Ladies From St. Petersburg: Three Novellas</p>
        <p>By Nina Berberova. New Directions, $12.95.</p>
        <p>This posthumous collection revolves around themes of flight and exile from Mother Russia, and is steeped in an unromantic view of the author's homeland. In 1998 our reviewer, Ken Kalfus, admired ''the lucidity of . . . Berberova's prose and the deftness of her characterizations.'' New Directions has also reissued The Blue Lantern: And Other Stories, by Victor Pelevin ($12.95), in which irony, dark humor and existential musings are given free rein in the strange landscape of post-Soviet Russia. Pelevin continues to ''gnaw at our confidence in conventional reality, like a dog worrying a bone,'' Kalfus wrote here in 1997.</p>
        <p>Rome and a Villa</p>
        <p>By Eleanor Clark. Steerforth Italia, $18.</p>
        <p>This series of rapturous sketches of postwar Rome and its people, originally published in 1952 and updated in 1974, displays Clark's ''genius for attention, observation and recording'' and ''a true sense and love of the grand, the tragic, the beautiful,'' Katherine Anne Porter wrote in the Book Review. In The Miracle of Castel dI Sangro, by Joe McGinniss (Broadway, $14.95), the author of ''Fatal Vision'' travels to a remote Italian village to chronicle the efforts of the local soccer team to recreate its Cinderella season of a year earlier. The result is ''an engaging tale well worth telling, rich in comic incidents, delightful characters and dramatic surprises,'' Bill Barich said here in 1999.</p>
        <p>Midnights: A Year With the Wellfleet Police</p>
        <p>By Alec Wilkinson. Ruminator, $14.</p>
        <p>At the age of 23, the author spent a year as a rookie policeman on the nine-man force in a small town on Cape Cod. His account of the trials and tedium of life in uniform ''enchants the reader into caring about the subject and wanting to read on,'' Peter Benchley wrote here in 1982. ''His perceptions of and compassion for his fellow officers are profound.''</p>
        <p>East of the Mountains</p>
        <p>By David Guterson. Harvest/Harcourt, $14.</p>
        <p>A Seattle heart doctor who is dying of cancer sets out for the high deserts and canyons of eastern Washington with his two dogs to commit suicide. ''When Guterson is at his best, the story and the landscape nearly become one,'' Robert Sullivan wrote here in 1999.</p>
