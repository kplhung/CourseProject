        <p>Endowed with a bill of rights that is one of the world's most expansive and beset by an AIDS crisis that is one of world's worst, South Africa finds itself trying to reconcile the two in the face of a challenge to its practice of disqualifying gay men from giving blood.</p>
        <p>The South African Human Rights Commission has concluded that under the country's liberal four-year-old Constitution, men who have sex with other men cannot for that reason alone be disqualified as blood donors, as they are here and in most countries, including the United States.</p>

        <p>Endowed with a bill of rights that is one of the world's most expansive and beset by an AIDS crisis that is one of world's worst, South Africa finds itself trying to reconcile the two in the face of a challenge to its practice of disqualifying gay men from giving blood.</p>
        <p>The South African Human Rights Commission has concluded that under the country's liberal four-year-old Constitution, men who have sex with other men cannot for that reason alone be disqualified as blood donors, as they are here and in most countries, including the United States.</p>
        <p>But the nation's blood banks have so far refused to abide by the commission's opinion, and the two sides are searching for a compromise. But if they cannot find some common ground, the matter could end up in court, pitting the constitutional freedoms that many here died struggling for against the epidemic that so many here are now dying from.</p>
        <p>In South Africa, which has a population estimated at 44 million, the rate of new infections is among the highest on the continent, and the spread of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, is perhaps the most serious threat to the country's future.</p>
        <p>A safe blood supply is essential to containing the crisis, and for the people who run the blood banks, that responsibility can mean hard decisions and hurt feelings. Understanding as they say they are of the pain their policies can cause, they make no apologies for them.</p>
        <p>''My job is to maintain the safety of the blood supply, and worldwide there are certain risk factors that would compromise that safety,'' said Prof. Anthon Heyns, medical director of the South African Blood Transfusion Service, which is based here and is the largest of the country's six blood banks, supplying about 60 percent of the nation's blood.</p>
        <p>One of those risk factors is male-to-male sex, according to the United States Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the blood supply in the United States and helps set the standards used in much of the world. Others include using intravenous drugs, having sex with prostitutes and traveling in Africa.</p>
        <p>Few of the risk factors, however, have drawn the kind of impassioned criticism that has periodically surfaced toward the ban on men who have had sex with other men.</p>
        <p>For activists, the case will be an important test of the Constitution, which is unequivocal in its protection of the civil rights of gays and lesbians.</p>
        <p>''It's an infringement on gay men's rights, and what's the worth of the Constitution if people's rights are not being protected,'' said Carrie Shelver, director of the National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality, an umbrella organization of about 50 groups around the country. ''It's really based on stereotypes, and the stereotype is that gay men are promiscuous.''</p>
        <p>The case here began almost a year ago after a gay man filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission alleging discrimination on the part of a Cape Town blood bank that rejected him because he had said he had sex with another man at least once in the previous five years.</p>
        <p>After studying the matter for several months, the commission handed down its opinion earlier this year, saying blood banks could not exclude men who have sex with other men from giving blood. Such men, the commission said, are no more of a risk to a safe blood supply than any number of other groups for whom there are no such restrictions.</p>
        <p>''I think the Human Rights Commission is spot on,'' said Prof. Udo Schuklenk, the director of the bioethics program at the University of the Witwatersrand here and the coeditor of the magazine Bioethics. ''The problem is, you're discriminating against people. Equal risk is being treated unequally.''</p>
        <p>Professor Schuklenk says the questions asked of prospective donors need to be more specific about their sexual practices -- for instance whether the sex was protected by a condom -- to discern the risk to the blood supply.</p>
        <p>Advocates of the current restrictions say that even that is not enough.  ''We cast a wide safety net, and inevitably with a safety net you are going to unfortunately pull in people who would otherwise be safe donors,'' said Dr. Arthur Bird, medical director of the Western Province Blood Transfusion Service in Cape Town.</p>
        <p>The commission has said that it would like to see a study done on the prevalence of H.I.V. among gay men here to see whether South Africa is indeed justified in following the guidelines laid down by public health authorities in the United States and other countries where the infection patterns have shown marked difference.</p>
