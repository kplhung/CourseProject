        <p>Sandra Bloodworth had arranged a vase of silk magnolia blooms on top of the table covered with a red-and-white checkered cloth. The food was kept hot in carefully wrapped pots, though the day was so uncharitably warm (too warm, in fact, for wearing lipstick, a fact that most of the ladies present chose to disregard) that the pots needed no help staying as cozy as a Mississippi weevil in a boll at the height of August.</p>
        <p>''This is my traditional red beans and rice, with summer sausage, red beans, fresh oregano and thyme,'' Ms. Bloodworth explained to a woman who was not among the 40 Mississippians and New Yorkers who had received invitations to her annual picnic within the picnic sprawled deep in the somewhat piney woods of Central Park, under the elms and beeches of the East Meadow.</p>
        <p>(''We would never turn anyone away,'' she confided, her drawl peeking out only with words like ''Southern.'')</p>
        <p>Certainly no one would go hungry during this 21st Annual Way Up North in Mississippi picnic, where by 2 p.m., 400 people, mostly Ole Miss graduates, women in pink T-shirts that read ''Grits,'' for Girls Raised in the South, and others missing Mississippi had bought tickets for catfish lunches, which they ate in the scarce shade, serenaded by a band fresh out of Batesville.</p>
        <p>''And the appetizer,'' Ms. Bloodworth continued, ''is a famous Southern dish, pimento cheese. It is usually spread on sandwiches, but we have crackers. And that's Carol, she's from southern Mississippi. Carol, how old is Mammy? Her mother made these.''</p>
        <p>Mammy is the mother of Carol Durham (''as in Bull Durham tobacco''), and her given name is Bernice, but everyone calls her Mammy, and she sent these cookies up for the picnic, the one that Governor Musgrove -- David Ronald, known to everyone as Ronnie -- had traveled clear up from Jackson to attend.</p>
        <p>Mammy enjoyed the picnic so much a few years ago that she contrived to send up these green and pink cookies, with green chips for seeds, resembling for all the world a slice of watermelon, or at least a slice of watermelon drawn by a human hand and not by the hand of the Almighty.</p>
        <p>On the other hill, a lady wore a dress with the same pink and green and seed motif. And on the nearby path, around Carol's prized Checker Cab, 30 real watermelons, offering up the promise of their wetness in the 92-degree heat, were arranged as if the honoree of the day, Willie Morris, the late magazine editor and author of ''My Dog Skip'' and member of the Mississippi pantheon, right up with Faulkner and Welty, were there to describe them.</p>
        <p>With the white and black squares of the cab next to the dark green and light green stripes of the fruit, it was about the sweetest distillation of everything this unending afternoon -- with its young boy flapping branches, climbing a tree, hollering, ''I've got to be able to fly''; with its New York actor who still gets the weekly paper from his hometown so small it might best be described as where God lost his shoes; with its kindly strangers inquiring right off as to where one was from; with its moist heat that the young man leaning in the shimmering air over six vats of simmering grease for the catfish and hush puppies could still describe as ''peaceful,'' since it was not as humid as his native Jackson -- was all about.</p>
