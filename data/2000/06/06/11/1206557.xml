        <p>Kelvin and Melvin Sosa once spent their afternoons playing basketball and video games. Now the 10-year-old twins have taken to the streets.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to stop doing this unless we rename this to Big Pun Avenue,'' Melvin said of their efforts to name 163rd Street after the South Bronx rapper who died in February.</p>
        <p>Identically dressed in baggy jeans and T-shirts bearing Big Pun Avenue logos, the fifth graders are members of the Hot Spot Street Team. For the last few weeks, the group of 30 youths has circulated petitions to drum up support for honoring Big Pun with his own street. So far, they have nearly 3,000 signatures; their goal is 30,000.</p>
        <p>David Bryson, owner of the Hot Spot record store and the campaign's unofficial leader, hopes the total will be large enough to convince the local community board to support the effort.</p>
        <p>''He was a Puerto Rican,'' Mr. Bryson said of the rapper, ''and he achieved things that 10 years ago we could not have achieved. His legacy says no matter who you are, no matter where you come from, you can be anything you want to be.''</p>
        <p>The rapper, Christoper Rios, who was known as Big Pun, short for Big Punisher, lived in the Bronx until his death at 28 from causes related to obesity. He had sold more than two  million records.</p>
        <p>Despite his accomplishments, Big Pun Avenue faces formidable opposition. Last year, Community Board 2 issued a moratorium on recommending street name changes after receiving four proposals to rename roadways after people, including Gen. Colin L. Powell, who was raised on Kelly Street.</p>
        <p>But Orlando Marin, chairman of the board's housing and land-use committee, was so moved by the youths' presentation that he asked them to make their case before the full board on June 28.</p>
        <p>The district manager, John Robert, said the chances that the board would support renaming a major thoroughfare like 163rd Street are slim but not out of the question. The proposal is already receiving special consideration because Councilman Pedro Espada endorses it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada, 26, who calls himself the ''first hip-hop elected official in the state of New York,'' said the issue involves more than moratoriums.</p>
        <p>''It's definitely a generation gap between Big Pun's group of appreciation and the representatives on the community board,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robert agrees. ''I suspect that if we canvass the board members and even asked them who Big Pun was, half of them wouldn't know,'' he said.</p>
