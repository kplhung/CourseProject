        <p>HENRY SCHANNEN happily concedes that he had an advantage when he began creating his rhododendron display garden five years ago. While such a garden normally takes a decade to establish, Mr. Schannen, a market research executive, did it in only 18 months. He now has what experts have called one of the most diverse rhododendron collections in the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schannen's advantage was four 100-by-14-foot ''cold houses,'' plastic-covered structures that he had been renting 10 miles from what is now his display garden in Jackson, N.J. The cold houses held the thousands of rhododendron plants he had been breeding and acquiring since 1966.</p>
        <p>That was the year he went to a meeting of the American Rhododendron Society, seeking information on rhododendrons for use in his passion, bonsai. Once there, he fell in love with the richness of the genus and its 850 species and thousands of different forms. Almost overnight, he says, the quest for rhododendrons began.</p>
        <p>At first, he kept his acquisitions at his home and at the home of his parents nearby. In 1986, he rented two cold houses to hold the plants, which were growing in both size and number and were tucked into pots of 1, 3, 5, 7 and, ultimately, 10 gallons.</p>
        <p>The expansion continued, but when a fourth house threatened to spill over to a fifth in 1995, he knew it was time for a permanent home. He purchased the 11-acre Jackson site, fenced it and spent the rest of the year having four acres cleared and an irrigation system installed. He also put in two miles of dirt roads, so trucks could deposit the pots throughout the property.</p>
        <p>In spring 1996, Mr. Schannen began the many round trips between his permanent location, now called Rare Find Nursery, and the cold houses. At each end a helper waited, one to load the truck and the other to unload the rhododendrons and plant them, with their labels. The goal was simply to get them planted; no thought was given to height, color schemes or blooming times. Somehow, it all works splendidly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schannen, a partner in the market research firm of Hase-Schannen in Princeton, worked every weekend that summer, many nights and quite a few vacation days. By first frost, all 3,000 rhododendrons had been planted.</p>
        <p>What drives a person to such a feat? ''You have to realize,'' Mr. Schannen said at the nursery, ''that I am a collector. Whenever I hear about a new rhododendron plant, I will go after it.'' His 35-year search has earned him the coveted gold medal award of the American Rhododendron Society as well as a board position on the Rhododendron Species Foundation.</p>
        <p>Although there is something of interest throughout the year, Mr. Schannen's garden is at peak bloom from late April through mid-June. Within rhododendron circles, it is attracting national attention. Dan Meier, manager of Briggs Nursery in Olympia, Wash., the country's largest wholesale rhododendron grower, visited in late May. ''The variety of form and color on display is phenomenal,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Among Mr. Schannen's rarities are Capistrano, the most cold-hardy yellow rhododendron; Hardy Gardenia, a low-growing, evergreen azalea with double white flowers resembling gardenia blooms; the variegated Goldflimmer; the brick-red Nakaharae hybrids, among the most heat-tolerant evergreen azaleas; and the curly-leaf Rosebay, an extremely rare compact form with twisted, rich green leaves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schannen sets two limits on his collecting. First, he has at most four of any single variety, guaranteeing diversity: there are well over 1,000 different varieties in his garden. Second, he has no plans to swell the plantings above 3,000. So every year, those that do not meet his standards of beauty and robustness are destroyed and replaced with new acquisitions.</p>
        <p>''I am also a hybridizer,'' he said. He is now evaluating over 8,000 seedlings.</p>
        <p>In addition to providing space for his collecting passion and serving as a hybridizing gene pool, Mr. Schannen's display garden is the source material for the rare and uncommon rhododendrons that he sells primarily through wholesale and mail order. Cuttings have been taken from about a third of his collection. One-year-old plants generally sell for $12.95, and three-year-olds for about twice that.</p>
        <p>Last year, he initiated a series of annual weekend open houses at which the garden can be viewed and plants purchased at the adjacent Rare Find Nursery. Today is the last of the spring open houses, held from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Directions, a free catalog and information about an Oct. 7 open house are available at (732) 833-0613; the address is 957 Patterson Road, Jackson, N.J. 08527. The garden and nursery are open by appointment at other times.</p>
        <p>George Woodard, a co-chairman of the seed exchange for the American Rhododendron Society, said, ''I believe Schannen's rhododendron gene pool matches that of any garden in the world.''</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Schannen's most popular introductions is Solidarity, which features large, luminous flowers that start as red buds, open to numerous delicate pink blossoms and then age to soft white.</p>
        <p>He wanted to name it after his mother, but she refused, saying, ''No one will buy a rhododendron called Wanda Pipchinski.'' Instead, she selected Solidarity, to honor the Polish labor movement.</p>
