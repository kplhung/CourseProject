      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In its previous incarnation the building at 169 Hudson Street was a decidedly unglamorous warehouse where cables and other materials used in the construction of bridges were kept by the John A. Roebling Steel Corporation, whose namesake founder designed the Brooklyn Bridge. Now the building, between Laight and Vestry Streets in TriBeCa, is being transformed into a luxury 12-unit condominium with such amenities as a temperature-controlled wine cellar and tasting room.</p>
        <p>Turning the building, which was put up in 1893 and used as a storage facility by the Roebling company and its successors, into a tony dwelling  was not difficult, said Joseph Vance, the project architect. ''It was built very well to handle tremendous amounts of weight and has nice high ceilings,'' he said. ''We kept the basic structure and flooring.''</p>

        <p>In its previous incarnation the building at 169 Hudson Street was a decidedly unglamorous warehouse where cables and other materials used in the construction of bridges were kept by the John A. Roebling Steel Corporation, whose namesake founder designed the Brooklyn Bridge. Now the building, between Laight and Vestry Streets in TriBeCa, is being transformed into a luxury 12-unit condominium with such amenities as a temperature-controlled wine cellar and tasting room.</p>
        <p>Turning the building, which was put up in 1893 and used as a storage facility by the Roebling company and its successors, into a tony dwelling  was not difficult, said Joseph Vance, the project architect. ''It was built very well to handle tremendous amounts of weight and has nice high ceilings,'' he said. ''We kept the basic structure and flooring.''</p>
        <p>An ironwork awning will be restored, and a cornice that showed up on original plans but that Mr. Vance said was either torn down or never built is being fabricated.</p>
        <p>Inside will be a major alteration: a 30-by-40-foot center courtyard to stretch from the fourth floor through the eighth is being carved out of the structure to greatly enhance its light. ''When you have a space that is 90 feet deep, there is light in the front and back but it is dark in the middle,'' Mr. Vance said. In addition, the floor on the fourth floor will have four large skylights to shed light down onto the third floor.</p>
        <p>The units are being sold as raw space. ''We've done several buildings with this developer,'' 169 Hudson Street LLC, ''and the the type of people who buy these prefer to do their own layout,'' Mr. Vance said. ''If they buy something that is already laid out, they tear everything out. So we put more emphasis and money into the bones and the mechanicals like plumbing, air-conditioning, heating and sprinklers.''</p>
        <p>Buyers will have plenty of room to figure out what kinds of rooms they want and how spacious they ought to be. The units will range from 4,383 square feet on the second floor, which is not on the courtyard ($1.5 million), and 4,383 square feet on the third floor ($1,650,000) to 3,752 square feet on the fourth through sixth floors ($1,725,000 to $1,850,000) and 6,450 square feet for the seventh-floor penthouse duplexes ($5 million).</p>
        <p>The condominium is being developed by BDB Development, whose partners, Charles Dunne, Sam Waksal and Jarrett Posner, have done five conversions of former factory buildings in SoHo and TriBeCa in the last three years. Occupancy is targeted for the late fall or early winter.</p>
