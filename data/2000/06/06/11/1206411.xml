        <p>IF you live in Connecticut, how likely are you to go to a play in Connecticut? Would you rather take the short trip to New York? Or a longer one to London, if you're really traveling snob class.</p>
        <p>Simply put, those are the questions included in one part of a vast ''regional cultural plan,'' actually part of the name of a survey done by Webb Management Services in New York to identify the audience most likely to attend the performing arts in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Custom dictates that theater flourishes in New York. Paul Collard, director of this year's International Festival of Arts and Ideas, would add the words prejudice, illusion and myth, to dispel the old-fangled notion that New York is mecca for theater. And Mr. Collard effectively challenges the stereotypical attitudes about better living (in the suburbs) vs. real culture (in the city).</p>
        <p>But there doesn't appear to be a there there, given that Broadway's new plays -- only two of the four up for a Tony Award last Sunday actually were new -- emanate from Off Broadway's non-profit theaters or from regional theater, or from London. One -- the English play ''Copenhagen'' and the winner as it happens -- had its American premiere in New Haven in 1998, during its London run.</p>
        <p>For two of its five years, Mr. Collard (who moved with his family from London to downtown New Haven three years ago) has been in charge of the International Festival of Arts and Ideas, a cultural gift to Stamford, New Haven and New London from Thursday through July 1.</p>
        <p>With a leap in ticket sales during the first week in June -- from $11,000 in 1998 to $100,000 this year -- and a budget of $4 million (double that of last year), Mr. Collard doesn't just believe that if theater that involves the brain is brought to the people of Connecticut, they will come; he knows they will.</p>
        <p>They came to ''Copenhagen.'' Michael Frayn's prize-winning drama about the philosophical, moral and emotional consequences of a quantum theory about atomic energy and the principle of uncertainty was a sellout at the Long Wharf Theater.</p>
        <p>''It is possible to persuade people not to go elsewhere if they are offered something genuine,'' Mr. Collard said. ''We defied all the common wisdom -- that we would be a disaster because we had no stars, that people in the suburbs only buy tickets by subscription, that at the end of June, no one goes to a play about ideas.''</p>
        <p>''And the work of London's Royal National Theater and the Royal Shakespeare Company has come here,'' he said, referring to last summer's productions of ''Troilus and Cressida'' and ''A Month in the Country,'' both at Long Wharf.</p>
        <p>And now ''Macbeth.'' Not just another ''Macbeth,'' but Gregory Doran's swift and intermissionless staging for the Royal Shakespeare Company in which Antony Sher in the title role was acclaimed as ''unparalleled'' and Harriet Walker as Lady Macbeth, another critic wrote, ''moves with the murderously incisive swiftness of a slasher's knife.''</p>
        <p>The Scottish play is to open at Long Wharf on Thursday -- the same opening night as the new Broadway production starring Kelsey Grammer. Performances in New Haven run through June 25 (tickets, 203-787-4282).</p>
        <p>Shakespeare -- three radical re-inventions in all and American premieres all -- is the theatrical bedrock of this year's Festival of Arts and Ideas.</p>
        <p>Most incendiary may be ''Giulio Cesare,'' directed by Romeo Castelluci and performed in Italian with surtitles, at the Rich Forum in Stamford, June 22 to 25 (tickets, 203-325-4466). ''This is the first time Castelluci's work is being seen in the United States,'' said Mr. Collard during a telephone conversation from New Haven. ''And this is very extreme theater,'' he added, knowing that his barely containable sense of adventure and risk needed to be tempered by a word of caution. Even the festival brochure reads: ''Not recommended for children or the fainthearted.''</p>
        <p>In talking about Mr. Castelluci, Mr. Collard mentioned the ''physical extremes'' of a ''very visual, image-driven'' director in his early 30's, who is considered ''one of the stars of the European theater circuit.'' Mr. Castelluci's work is frustrating to many, Mr. Collard added, because ''it divides audiences passionately; British critics loved it or hated it.''</p>
        <p>Stamford, New London and New Haven, in that order, will have a chance to attend ''A Master Class of Evil,'' which is the subtitle of the actor Steven Berkoff's one-man show, ''Shakespeare's Villains.''</p>
        <p>If you know Mr. Berkoff as a movie and television star (''Beverly Hills Cop,'' ''Octopussy,'' ''Rambo II'') hold on. In what Mr. Collard calls ''a great piece of acting,'' Mr. Berkoff ''takes on Shakespeare as we don't know it,'' portraying Hamlet, for example, as a serial killer.</p>
        <p>In a Long Wharf Workshop series, new performance pieces will be presented as well as a first hearing of Moliere's little-known work ''The Bungler'' in a new translation by the estimable Richard Wilbur. In full production, the work is to open Long Wharf's main stage season in September.</p>
        <p>It is a natural segue for the ideas part of an arts festival to be linked with provocative theater: lectures, conferences, symposiums and classes on such issues as political assassinations, Shakespeare in the real world take place throughout the festival, all admission free.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sher and Ms. Walter, Mr. Castelluci, Mr. Berkoff and Mr. Doran will all take part in the ''Artists in Conversation'' series.</p>
        <p>Ticket information and a calendar of events in opera, theater, music and dance can be obtained by calling 888-ART-IDEA or by visiting the Web site at www.artidea.org.</p>
