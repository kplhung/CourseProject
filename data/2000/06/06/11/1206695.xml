        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You must be commended for your series of articles about race relations as they affect the daily activities of individuals and communities (''How Race Is Lived in America,'' front page, June 4). Race is not an easy matter, because it is fraught with historical, political and economic repercussions. Nor can it easily be simplified or treated primarily as a distinction based on skin color.</p>
        <p>I have come to believe that it is a question of culture, of a separateness of culture that has its own distinctive overtones and undertones, its own humor and its own sensitivities. It is not easy for whites to penetrate or empathize with that culture. It prevails wherever there is a multicolored population: in Brazil, in India, in Cuba, for example.</p>

        <p>Status and treatment are often dependent on the degree of color of the individual. Even blacks in the United States who have been spared the pain of the slavery heritage and a host of subtle discriminations and have become ''integrated'' politically and economically continue to suffer social indignities.</p>
