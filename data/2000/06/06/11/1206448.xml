        <p>Interview with attorney Joseph E Bachelder 3d, a leading executive compensation negotiator, focuses on whether soaring executive pay, which many deem excessive, can be justified; Bachelder insists salary packages of corporate chief executives have grown at rate of about 2 percent over Consumer Price Index over the last 50 years, though he concedes bonuses have risen dramatically in that period; calls chief executives the chief custodians of economic growth; photo (M)</p>

        <p>AS shareholders gather for annual meetings, many are finding in their proxy statements further evidence that executive pay continues to soar. Even severance packages for top executives can mount into the millions, or tens of millions. As a leading executive compensation negotiator, Joseph E. Bachelder III, head of a Manhattan law firm that bears his name, may deserve a share of the credit, or the blame.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bachelder has negotiated employment contracts for Louis V. Gerstner Jr. at RJR Nabisco and I.B.M.; Lawrence A. Bossidy, the former chairman at AlliedSignal; and George M. C.

        <p>Mr. Bachelder agreed recently to discuss whether he was doing too good a job. Following are excerpts from the conversation.</p>
        <p>STEWART KAMPEL</p>
        <p>Q. What justifies these enormous pay packages?</p>
        <p>A. Actually, they haven't gone up so dramatically. Over the last 50 years, the salary packages of C.E.O.'s have grown at a rate of about 2 percent over the Consumer Price Index, and in the 1950's and 60's the growth was actually lower than workers' pay rises.</p>
        <p>Bonuses, however, are up dramatically. And so are stock options, as part of pay packages. Over all, major U.S. corporations are doing very well. Equity has gone up over 10 times since the 80's and 90's, largely because of the dramatic growth in the markets. And shareholders have benefited greatly. That's wonderful.</p>
        <p>The U.S. economy has been growing, and  the C.E.O.'s are the chief custodians for extraordinarily growing basic assets. This has been an extraordinary period, but it was just like at the turn of the last century. Just look at all those big houses in Newport.</p>
        <p>What has also fueled the rise is momentum. There is a very competitive market for top executives. Executive search firms hardly existed years ago. Now they're so big that some have even gone public. That created a dynamic that didn't exist. So the corporation reflects the general prosperity of  many companies.</p>
        <p>Q. If the value of a company's stock drops, should executives with large contracts give something back?</p>
        <p>A. What is compensation? It's pay for services over the long term and the short term. If I worked for 10 years and the company had 2 bad years, how should we look at it? The C.E.O. was responsible for the enormous wealth and growth of the company as well as the opportunity everyone had to ride with its good fortune. Except for a Michael Jordan, who never had one, C.E.O.'s can have a bad year. They do get fired. Some may ''retire'' at a young age, but a significant number are really being fired.</p>
        <p>Q. Many chief executives are getting lavish perquisites like the personal use of company planes, country club memberships, a car and driver and services like secretarial help even after they leave or retire. Are you doing your job too well?</p>
        <p>A. I would attribute these unusual perks to unusual circumstances. First, extraordinary C.E.O.'s win special arrangements. Second, precedent is very important. Then those precedents become the standard. Say Charlie Snoggs wants the same perks as Jack Welch. So he becomes a competitor.  He's competing for profits. And he wants a competitive salary, pension and bonus.</p>
        <p>Q. Your experience is mostly with old-economy companies. What should an executive of one of these businesses focus on: wages, perks or stock options? And what should an executive look for in a new-economy firm?</p>
        <p>A. For an old-economy firm, pensions are very important. C.E.O.'s move so frequently today that they don't build up pensions. So it's important to have the company ensure your pension. And it's vital to have it funded.</p>
        <p>At new-economy companies, one strategy is to purchase stock with a promissory note, which qualifies for long-term capital gains, and then have the note forgiven. Stock options will allow you to buy when the company is private and to cash in when it goes public.</p>
        <p>Q. More generally, how can an executive get the best deal?</p>
        <p>A. Don't exaggerate or misrepresent your salary. You'll be found out. If you're going to work for a new company, look at their proxy statements, see what they are paying their top people. Examine the form and nature of  payment. Try to get credit for your service at your present company.</p>
        <p>What happens if there is a change in control of the company? Be protected.</p>
        <p>Check the proxy statement to see the range of bonuses that senior executives can expect. And don't quit Company A till you get what you what you want at Company B -- in writing.</p>
