        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his review of ''Newjack'' (May 14), Ted Conover's account of his year as a guard inside Sing Sing prison, Daniel Bergner says that ''it is hard to imagine any journalist doing this more daringly or effectively.'' Yet he complains that Conover ''fails to take us inside the characters'' of prisoners and other guards. But doing that would have meant asking questions. Questions might well have got him hurt and wrecked his enterprise. Let an author who isn't working there ask the questions.</p>

        <p>Thanks largely to public indifference and parsimony, Sing Sing and many other prisons disgrace our nation. Demagogues persuade us to be both mindlessly ''tough on crime'' and too shortsighted to see that brutalizing prisoners (instead of, say, educating them) increases the likelihood that they will brutalize us when they get out. Conover has performed a needed service by bringing these matters so vividly to public attention. Whether the public responds is, as usual, up to us.</p>
