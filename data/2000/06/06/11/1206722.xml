        <p>While the spirits of the missing superstars Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet were hanging over the homestretch, the 132nd Belmont Stakes was run yesterday with a cast of 11 horses of far less magnitude. And the one who got there first was one of the least likely: Commendable, 17th in the Kentucky Derby, without a victory in six races since his debut last August at Del Mar and an 18-1 long shot in the Belmont.</p>
        <p>If any touch of greatness rubbed off on Commendable, it probably came through his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, who won the Belmont for the fourth time after losing it last year when Charismatic fractured a leg in the homestretch and missed sweeping the Triple Crown. It also was his 13th victory in a Triple Crown race, tying him for the record with the late Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons.</p>

        <p>While the spirits of the missing superstars Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet were hanging over the homestretch, the 132nd Belmont Stakes was run yesterday with a cast of 11 horses of far less magnitude. And the one who got there first was one of the least likely: Commendable, 17th in the Kentucky Derby, without a victory in six races since his debut last August at Del Mar and an 18-1 long shot in the Belmont.</p>
        <p>If any touch of greatness rubbed off on Commendable, it probably came through his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, who won the Belmont for the fourth time after losing it last year when Charismatic fractured a leg in the homestretch and missed sweeping the Triple Crown. It also was his 13th victory in a Triple Crown race, tying him for the record with the late Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons.</p>
        <p>It also was a moment of success for his jockey, Pat Day, who won the race for the third time, and for his owners, Beverly and Bob Lewis of Los Angeles, who have won the Derby and the Preakness with Silver Charm and Charismatic in the last four years before those horses were thwarted in the Belmont.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, it was a case of the downtrodden rising up and causing a mighty upset. Commendable, a son of Gone West, won his first start 10 months ago but had not run better than fourth since then. In the Derby, which Lukas faced without his customary stable of stars, Commendable ran 26 lengths behind Fusaichi Pegasus. Then he sat out the Preakness, which was won by Red Bullet with Pegasus second. But yesterday, he found the winner's circle, outrunning the favorite, Aptitude, by a length and a half with Unshaded another length farther back in third place and Wheelaway six more lengths back in fourth.</p>
        <p>When Commendable and his 10 rivals appeared for the Belmont Stakes before a crowd of 67,810 yesterday at Belmont Park, there was no suspense about sweeping the Triple Crown. After three years of racing drama, this was a year when three horses would win the three classics. And the Belmont horses were suspected of being second-tier types searching for a way to overtake Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet for honors in the second half of the year.</p>
        <p>Even then, Commendable was a long shot in a field of long shots, paying $39.60 for a $2 bet to win after taking second place behind Hugh Hefner at the start of the race and taking over the lead with a quarter of a mile to go.</p>
        <p>''At the head of the stretch, I hadn't asked him for anything,'' Day remembered, sounding as surprised as anyone. ''I wasn't even sure how much he had left.''</p>
        <p>Lukas, declining to play down what his horse had achieved, said: ''My wife asked me this morning if we could win this thing. I replied, 'Absolutely.' You have to look at what you're up against and the field you are faced with. We had a horse to fit this very well.''</p>
        <p>He also had a horse who had earned $88,470 in seven races before the Belmont, and then went home with first prize of $600,000. Also, no horse had ever won the Belmont without racing at least once after the Kentucky Derby, and Commendable outran just two horses in the Derby field of 19. As it was, when Commendable turned his trick in the Belmont on a hot and sultry afternoon with the temperature in the 90's, he ran the mile and a half in a tardy 2:31, a full seven seconds slower than Secretariat did in 1974.</p>
        <p>Not only that, but Commendable lost his left front shoe in the paddock yesterday while being saddled. Lukas explained that the hardened rubber brick matting in the paddock tended to stick to horse shoes. When Commendable turned in his stall, his shoe simply came off. But a blacksmith was summoned, who restored shoe to hoof.</p>
        <p>''When I talked to Mr. Lukas before the race,'' Day said, ''he thought the important thing was to have an energy-saving ride. We knew Hugh Hefner would be going out to the lead, so my job was to get Commendable into a comfortable spot tracking him.''</p>
        <p>Day did just that. Hugh Hefner, as expected, shot into the lead coming out of the gate and held it with Commendable right on his heels. They stayed in tandem through some very slow fractions: half a mile in 491/5  seconds, one mile in 1:39. Then when they turned into the stretch, Hugh Hefner was done, fading to eighth place. Commendable, though, withstood late challenges from three well-regarded closers: Aptitude, who ran second in the Derby; Unshaded, who skipped both the Derby and the Preakness; and Wheelaway, who ran fifth in the Derby but skipped the Preakness.</p>
        <p>''At the eighth pole, I still thought I had a chance,'' said Alex Solis, the rider on Aptitude. ''But Commendable had too easy a time.''</p>
        <p>After they crossed the line, Shane Sellers leaped off Unshaded, who was wobbling with heat exhaustion. Celeste Kunz, the track veterinarian, reported: ''He had a mild case of heat exhaustion, and we mechanically lowered his body temperature by applying hoses and ice water. He recovered quickly and walked back to his barn.''</p>
        <p>It was a day when several jockeys envisioned a trip to the winner's circle that didn't materialize. Richard Migliore, Wheelaway's rider, said: ''I was very calm because I thought I was sitting on the winner. When I asked for more, he flattened out.''</p>
        <p>Impeachment, the only horse who ran in all three Triple Crown races, finished third in the Derby and the Preakness and fifth in the Belmont. His trainer, Todd Pletcher, said: ''Our worst fears come true. We didn't get the pace we needed. He made a nice run, but couldn't close into those splits.'' And his jockey, Craig Perret, said: ''I'm proud of him. He ran in all three races and never disgraced himself.''</p>
        <p>But the highest praise for Lukas came from his West Coast rival, Bobby Frankel, the trainer of Aptitude, who said: ''Give Lukas credit. I don't know how he did it.''</p>
