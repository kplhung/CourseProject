        <p>Last spring, Peter Fleischer had had enough.</p>
        <p>He had just lost his job as assistant commissioner for policy at the city's Transportation Department in what he said was a political housecleaning, and after eight years in government he needed a fresh perspective.</p>
        <p>So he hopped into his 17-foot kayak and set off on a voyage that may never have been attempted before.</p>
        <p>He never left the city.</p>
        <p>On June 1, in calm water under a baking sun, Mr. Fleischer paddled under a pier on  Governors Island. At that point, he said, he reached his goal of exploring all 578 miles of the city's coastline.</p>
        <p>Ralph Diaz, a kayaker who publishes a kayaking newsletter, said that some veteran kayakers probably had covered the whole waterfront in the course of their travels. But he knows of no one who has set out purposely to do so, or who has done so in so short a time.</p>
        <p>Along the way Mr. Fleischer, a boyish-looking 41-year-old with a lopsided blond haircut, got lost in the serpentine channels in the marshes of Udall's Cove in northeastern Queens. He saw the coast of Maine in the craggy islands of Pelham Bay. And he got chased by a Department of Corrections boat when he ventured too close to Rikers Island.</p>
        <p>In Little Neck Bay, he saw flocks of birds hovering over disturbed water and drew nearer. ''I saw dozens if not hundreds of tiny silvery fish leaping out, with a giant striped bass or maybe a trout leaping in the air out of the water, chasing these little fish,'' he said. ''I'd seen wildlife in New York City before, but it was the first time I'd seen wildlife in action in New York City, with flux and frenzy and result.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer was nearly as impressed by what he did not see. ''I did not see a dead body in 600 miles,'' he said. ''I only saw rats once. I only saw something being discharged out of a pipe twice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer, aided occasionally by his wife, did his circumnavigating in about 50 chunks, mostly last spring and summer, choosing the day's destination based on weather and time constraints. The only stretch he did not travel under his own power was the restricted waters on the south side of Rikers Island, where he convinced corrections officials to give him a ride on a police boat after his pass at the north side nearly got him arrested.</p>
        <p>Every day he was struck by the contrasts between the built city and the liquid landscape that flows in and around it.</p>
        <p>''In New York, we live in a grid where everything's pretty permanent,'' he said. ''You sort of know where the curb will be, you know where the street will be, you know where your door will be. But on Jamaica Bay, you'll be looking across an area maybe half the length of Manhattan that looks like a giant flat sea, and once it goes to low tide, the marsh is three feet higher than your boat and you have no visibility at all.''</p>
        <p>The trip transformed the mariner. Mr. Fleischer, who holds an M.B.A., now wants to go back to school -- for a Ph.D. in geography and the environment.</p>
