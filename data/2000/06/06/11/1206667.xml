        <p>ARIA LAMS was matter of fact about her illness. ''I've been sick since I was a little girl,'' she told her first-grade classmates last fall. ''I had lost my hair. But now I'm better.''</p>
        <p>She had had leukemia since she was 3 1/2, and after more than two years of treatment was in remission. Her teacher, Lori Blue glass, threw a party in class with about 40 students and teachers. Aria and her brother  Jordan, a fifth grader, danced for everyone. Aria was 6 and happy.</p>
        <p>By January, a persistent flu turned into a fresh diagnosis of leukemia. The news settled like fog over the all-first-grade John Paulding School, which is usually a carnival of little people, or, as the principal says, ''a place for toothless wonders.''</p>
        <p>Every school has children with adult-size problems, but a 6-year-old flirting with death gave everyone new perspective on life. As another school year winds down, the courage of the blue-eyed girl in pink pajamas lying in isolation at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has reminded teachers here why they teach.</p>
        <p>''We are always hoping we have an impact on the child,'' Mrs. Blueglass said, ''but for a child to have such an impact on me --  that's the kind of thing you don't imagine.''</p>
        <p>Aria has barely been to school since January. Mrs. Blueglass has tutored her at home, helping her with reading and projects. One day, Mrs. Blueglass arranged for Aria to come to school after dismissal, so she could make wind chimes, like the other students had. Janitors scrubbed the classroom to protect Aria from germs.</p>
        <p>''She was so happy,'' remembered Mrs. Blueglass, the mother of three, including first-grade twins. ''She looked around. She said: 'Look, my name's still on my hook. My pictures are still up.' I said, 'Of course, you're still part of the class.' ''</p>
        <p>Aria endured another round of chemotherapy and again lost her brown hair. Doctors said her only hope was a bone marrow transplant. Her brother turned out to be a perfect match and willing donor. ''Whatever it takes,'' he told his father, Jeff Lams, a musician.</p>
        <p>ARIA returned to class for three days in May before the transplant. She wore a straw hat with a flower. A piece of tissue inside kept the straw from scratching her head. She took off the hat and hung it on the hook under her name. Some children didn't recognize her at first, but then they realized it was just Aria. ''She didn't have any hair,'' her classmate Jonathan said the other day, wrestling with a difficult idea, ''but it counts on the inside more.''</p>
        <p>That was the moment Mrs. Blueglass learned the lesson of Aria. Here was a little girl, bald and vulnerable, yet buoyant. ''I don't know that I could have done what she did,'' Mrs. Blueglass said, ''come in here and take off her hat and hang it on her hook.''</p>
        <p>Aria floated down the hall, greeting people. Her classmates protectively whispered to Mrs. Blueglass that some children had giggled at Aria's baldness. But Aria was oblivious. In a picture she drew of herself in class, she is wearing bold purple and orange clothes and a distinctive purple hat. ''It's a sign of happiness,'' Mrs. Blueglass said.</p>
        <p>After the third day at school, Aria went to the hospital for the transplant. ''I picked her up that afternoon,'' Mr. Lams said, ''and there was hugging and tears. Kids, the principal, teachers.''</p>
        <p>Aria's hospital room is adorned with signs of a community caring. There are cards from family friends at the First Baptist Church of Tarrytown, letters from children, stuffed animals, an enlarged $5,000 check representing money raised by raffling a quilt made by a Paulding teacher, Mary Kate McCabe. Classmates call, and Aria's kindergarten teacher, Karen Garibaldi, telephones daily and works on spelling with her.</p>
        <p>Aria is scheduled to come home soon, but she won't be able to return to class this school year. Even so, said the principal, Marilyn Mercado-Belvin, the year will be remembered as the one Aria ''taught us all about strength and courage.'' Mrs. Blue glass is making sure Aria doesn't miss all the year-end activities -- like publishing her first book.</p>
        <p>Aria's book, ''Big Bear,'' is about a family skiing trip. In the book, there is no fear, only fun. ''We went down a hill with nets at the bottom to catch us if we went too far,'' Aria wrote.</p>
        <p>With Aria in the hospital, Mrs. Blueglass wrote the book's ''About the Author'' page. ''I am in first grade at John Paulding School,'' it reads. ''I like to sing, dance and act. My best friend is Laura.'' Then, drawing on the hope Aria taught her, Mrs. Blue glass wrote, ''I can't wait to start second grade.''</p>
