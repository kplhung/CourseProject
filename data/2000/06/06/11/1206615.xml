        <p>Picking up where we left off . . .</p>
        <p>In those far away, long ago days of feminism, there was talk about equal pay for equal work. Now there's talk about ''girl money.''</p>
        <p>A friend of mine, in her early 30's, says she hears the term bandied about the New York dating scene.</p>
        <p>''What I find most disturbing about the 1950's-ification and retrogression of women's lives is that it has seeped into corporate and social culture, where it can do real damage,'' she says. ''Otherwise intelligent men, who know women still earn less than men as a rule, say things like: 'I'll get the check. You only have girl money.' ''</p>
        <p>My friend also notes that at three wedding showers she went to this year, the presents were always very 50's -- soup ladles and aprons were unwrapped with see-through nighties and push-up brassieres.</p>
        <p>So, are we evolving backward?</p>
        <p>In The New York Observer this week, Nina Burleigh writes about how depressing it is to see former ''national nymphet'' Jane Fonda, former Yale Law School superstar Hillary Rodham and former Miami TV news anchor Donna Hanover all scrambling to recreate careers and patch up dignity, after their men took up ''with younger or more pliant females.''</p>
        <p>''Feminism wasn't supposed to mean brokenhearted women in middle age,'' Ms. Burleigh says. Of Jane, Hillary and Donna, she asks: ''Couldn't they conduct themselves with a little more spite and spirit?''</p>
        <p>It's true that we've made some evolutionary miscalculations.</p>
        <p>We started out, in the 70's, wanting to ape men. Dress like them, in navy  blue suits and floppy ties and sensible shoes. Joust for that big office and those big stressful jobs.</p>
        <p>But once we got far enough along to see that we could achieve male status and power, we recoiled at the idea of doing it on male terms.</p>
        <p>Why be rats on a treadmill, butting heads constantly, drinking too much,  having heart attacks and falling into affairs with office playthings?</p>
        <p>Women are not not going backward. We're moving ahead, at home and at work -- in any combination of the two. We're just moving in less predictable and programmatic ways. We can be rescued or choose not to be.</p>
        <p>''We can't replicate men -- and who would want to?'' says Natalie Angier, who writes about biology for The Times and in her book, ''Woman: An Intimate Geography.''</p>
        <p>Women, she says, are in a new phase.</p>
        <p>''Female primates have two goals,'' she explains. ''They want control over their reproduction and access to resources.'' Unfortunately, male primates have the same two goals; they want control over female reproduction too.</p>
        <p>We have a conflict of gender interest, so it turns out to be counterproductive for women to imitate men.</p>
        <p>In the old days, right up through Hillary Rodham, the best route to status and children was through a powerful husband. ''But now, because men often don't stick around, the husband route no longer looks as good to women,'' Ms. Angier says.</p>
        <p>Freud believed that men had something that women wanted. But it wasn't what he thought.</p>
        <p>Women don't want to be men -- except in the way men often grow more attractive and powerful as they age and are so easily able to start fresh, in their 50's and 60's and even older, with younger women.</p>
        <p>Ms. Angier suggests that someday women in their 20's will be freed from a biological deadline by routinely freezing eggs for use at any time.</p>
        <p>Women's liberation now means being liberated from stereotypes about what women want. Consider this: Hollywood, which is always rediscovering the obvious, is shocked that female moviegoers prefer Russell Crowe in ''Gladiator'' and Martin Lawrence in ''Big Momma's House'' to chick flicks like the Natalie Portman-Ashley Judd movie ''Where the Heart Is'' or Kim Basinger's ''I Dreamed of Africa.''</p>
        <p>Girls have always gone for the cute guys slaying the dragon, or in the case of ''Gladiator,'' the tiger. And they always will.</p>
        <p>Tom Sherak of 20th Century Fox told USA Today that women must have liked ''Big Momma'' because the Fox marketing execs brilliantly created ads to appeal to them. While Martin Lawrence in a dress was holding a gun in the outdoor ads, the newspaper ads tried to lure women by switching to Mr. Lawrence in a dress holding a rolling pin.</p>
        <p>It's pathetic that they think that is why women went to see the movie.</p>
        <p>Besides, women like guns.</p>
        <p>Just ask Dr. Freud.</p>
