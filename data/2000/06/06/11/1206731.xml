        <p>It's difficult to describe what you'll see if you attend ''Dancing With Horses,'' an unusual presentation next Saturday at 8 p.m. at Garret Mountain Park's equestrian center. Easier, perhaps, to describe it by not describing it.</p>
        <p>If you've been to a circus and seen horses prance on command -- well, this isn't that. If you've taken in the equestrian show at Medieval Times -- well, it's not that either.</p>
        <p>''It's really nothing like anyone's ever seen,'' said JoAnna Mendl Shaw, who is developing this blend of dance and equestrian artistry. ''It's not showmanship or circus tricks. It demands dressage skill, but it's not showcasing dressage proficiency.''</p>
        <p>The works are performed to music -- ''everything from Dave Brubeck to Bach to R.E.M.,'' she said. The program lasts about an hour, a dandy length for children, and benefits the handicapped riding program of Passaic County.</p>
