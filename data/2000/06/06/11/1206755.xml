        <p>In response to the popularity of mountain biking, the county has opened a network of trails at Sprain Ridge Park in Yonkers. Five miles will be marked according to proficiency, so beginners can practice on some trails and progress to others. Sprain Ridge is the county's third park designated for mountain bicycling. Blue Mountain Reservation in Peekskill has trails for all levels of ability, while Graham Hills Park in Pleasantville is geared toward more experienced cyclists.</p>
