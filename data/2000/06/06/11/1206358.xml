        <p>The Center for Family Life at St. James is a medical center in the Central Ward in Newark within walking distance of 10 senior citizens' housing projects in an area that has traditionally had few medical services available for residents. Established with grants from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the New Jersey Health Initiatives program and the Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey, the center aims to provide the quality of medical care available in a private doctor's office to the inner-city residents who otherwise often rely on hospital emergency rooms.</p>
        <p>The new center is at the St. James Preparatory School and provides medical care for the students at the school, which eventually will include 7th to 12th graders, as well as for the community. It is the inspiration of the Rev. William Watley, pastor of the St. James A.M.E. Church and Ronald J. Del Mauro, president of St. Barnabas Health Care System. It is operated with the cooperation of Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, which is part of St. Barnabas.</p>

        <p>The Center for Family Life at St. James is a medical center in the Central Ward in Newark within walking distance of 10 senior citizens' housing projects in an area that has traditionally had few medical services available for residents. Established with grants from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the New Jersey Health Initiatives program and the Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey, the center aims to provide the quality of medical care available in a private doctor's office to the inner-city residents who otherwise often rely on hospital emergency rooms.</p>
        <p>The new center is at the St. James Preparatory School and provides medical care for the students at the school, which eventually will include 7th to 12th graders, as well as for the community. It is the inspiration of the Rev. William Watley, pastor of the St. James A.M.E. Church and Ronald J. Del Mauro, president of St. Barnabas Health Care System. It is operated with the cooperation of Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, which is part of St. Barnabas.</p>
        <p>Luretha Stribling, a nurse practitioner and director of the center, talked recently about its mission. Ralph Green, a patient at the center also spoke about what the center meant to him.</p>
        <p>Q. How did the center get started?</p>
        <p>A. The St. James A.M.E. Church is one of the most active churches in the area as far as having all kinds of community programs. In addition to the spiritual activities of the church, Reverend Watley has a lunch program, a library, a reading program for children and many other services. Medical care just seemed like a natural outgrowth of that service to the community, especially here in the Central Ward, where there is little medical service available.</p>
        <p>In 1994 Reverend Watley started an ''Ask a Nurse'' program where a nurse was available two days a week to answer health questions. The center eventually developed from that. We had a tiny one-room office nearby for a while and then, using funding from the church and the healthcare grants, we moved into part of St. James Prep in January.</p>
        <p>Q. Why is the center different from a health-care clinic?</p>
        <p>A. This is not a clinic. It operates by appointment like a private doctor's office, although people can stop in without an appointment also. We see 130 to 160 people a month with nurse practitioners like myself, who can do head-to-toe examinations, write prescriptions and make referrals when necessary. Complete medical backgrounds are taken and kept on file. We deal with the patient's entire life and health care, not just with one ailment that might bring him or her to the center. The new facilities allow us to have our own laboratory and do a lot of our own testing. We have separate examination rooms, consultation rooms and storage and office space. We have a nutritionist, an H.I.V. counselor and such things as hypertension awareness programs.</p>
        <p>Q. Why was this needed?</p>
        <p>A. Years ago there used to be doctors' offices located downtown. Now there aren't any here. There are 50,000 residents in the area and 23,000 of them are senior citizens, many without transportation, so they had no medical care. Now many can  walk here. But we also are getting a van to provide transportation for them. This center can serve as a model for other urban areas where there are no medical facilities and no doctors available other than through the emergency rooms.</p>
        <p>Q. How does the medical center enhance people's lives?</p>
        <p>A. The church has a wealth of services, including giving out holiday baskets to people in the community whether or not they are church members. Rev. Watley started a lunch program and now 200 people attend. This is another service that improves people's lives, both church members and those who are not members. If people have good medical service, they feel better and that means they can work better and do more with their lives.</p>
        <p>Q. [To Ralph Green] Did the center make a difference in your life?</p>
        <p>A. MR. GREEN: I always went to the emergency room at the hospital before. Now, it's been a long time since I had to go to the emergency room. This is the first time in my life I have a primary care doctor. Because of my finances, I never could afford it before. My blood pressure is under control and I went back to work. I can call ahead for an appointment here. They explain everything to me and treat me with respect. I wouldn't change this for anything in the world.</p>
