        <p>ANATOMIES</p>
        <p>A Novella and Stories.</p>
        <p>By Anndee Hochman.</p>
        <p>240 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Picador USA. $18.</p>
        <p>FEW fiction writers can resist teaching their readers a lesson; but no intelligent reader likes being lectured to. ''Anatomies,'' Anndee Hoch-man's first collection of stories, contains a diverse range of characters: from little girls to lesbian mothers, from young gay photographers to atheistic auto mechanics. But a little teacherly tapping is audible as Hochman attempts do each of these characters justice; when she lets her readers relax, her stories are more affecting.</p>
        <p>The finely wrought title story opens with her protagonist, Mia, on an airplane, memorizing all 206 bones of the adult human skeleton. As Mia flips though ''Gray's Anatomy,'' her mind wanders to what awaits her when the plane lands, and Hochman gracefully opens the story outward to Mia's family history. A first-year medical student, Mia is flying home to Miami to see the grandfather who brought her to the United States after her parents were abducted by the Argentine police. Her grandmother has disappeared, and her grandfather is terrified of calling the authorities. ''Personas don't disappear,'' Mia tells him gently. ''En Argentina, si. Pero en Miami, no.'' By the end of the story, Mia's tender, complicated attachments to her family are illustrated as carefully as Gray's shaded ligaments; the reader learns the vocabulary of Mia's life the way Mia does the ''Latin melody'' of her textbook.</p>
        <p>Hochman is at her best in medias res, un-self-consciously exploring the resonances of her many graceful metaphors. Two stories that are strikingly successful are ''Do Not Attempt to Climb Out,'' in which a janitor is stuck in a stalled elevator, remembering the way his sister's corn bread ''gave a kiss of steam when he broke it in two,'' and ''Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend,'' in which a girl sprints around a baseball diamond musing about ''the absent way Tommy Lafair handled his math book.'' The janitor, counting his sins, does not know, in the end, whether the elevator has started up or down; Vannie -- a softball player no doubt -- happily learns after touching all the bases how to slide right in toward the ''panting, eager catcher.''</p>
        <p>Used more bluntly, however, these metaphors take on a deadening earnestness. The opening story, ''In Case of Emergency,'' concerns a lesbian couple and their daughter who lose a close male friend to AIDS. Their friend's mother, after visiting her dying son, has sent them his umbilical stump, with a note that reads, ''He's your responsibility now.'' Hochman painstakingly portrays this unconventional family's affection for their friend; when he dies they all bury the umbilical stump in the garden, near ''Mo's diaphragm, which she'd given a ritualistic burial to mark her coming-out years ago.'' Next to these objects, they plant bulbs: ''by next spring,'' the story ends with transparent conviction, the forgiving earth will yield ''a ruckus of brave blooms, roots tangling underground, a whole field of malas flores.''</p>
        <p>Other stories are similarly dulled by Hochman's insistent morals. Both ''Aggiornamento'' and ''Dark Is Not a Single Shade of Gray'' describe the menace of marriage: Mr. Petrazzi, an undertaker who smells of embalming fluid, is predictably implicated in his wife's fatal fall; T. H. Logan, an inimical police officer, drives his wife mad with grief by killing the seal she used to love to swim with. The reality of domestic abuse fades with Hochman's fervor.</p>
        <p>''I Seen Some Stuf Horabl Stuf Lisen'' allows readers to draw their own conclusions. The narrator has been abandoned by her partner, Nancy, who persuaded her to take a chance with ''donor number 612.'' Her son, Avi, goes from happily singing ''We don't have a Da-ad, we don't have a Da-ad'' to the checkout clerk at the grocery store to the more plaintive ''We don't have a Nan-cy, we don't have a Nan-cy.'' Overwhelmed with grief and fury, his mother slaps him ''once, smartly, on his cheek.'' Her shame over the incident is so wrenchingly articulated that by the time the story ends, with the 6-year-old son standing on his bed in his Superman pajamas, to give his mother a hug, the difficulty of lesbian parenthood is manifest, and the competency of this mother implicit.</p>
