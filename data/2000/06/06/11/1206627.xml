        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a 20-something, fully and forcibly indoctrinated into the New Economy, I found Harold Bloom's article to be a breath of fresh air. I have seen my greatest teachers, from Chaucer to Milton, left at the wayside by an increasingly insensitive technology-biased generation. I have many colleagues, highly ''educated,'' who know myriad programming languages but possess scant familiarity with the English language. Oh, how our values have changed! An electronic book is no more a book than a chat room is a conversation, or an e-mail can be a love letter. If the time does come that the bound volume is relegated to antique shops and flea markets, I hope that I am long gone.</p>
