        <p>THE Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation -- the largest anywhere, with an endowment of $22 billion -- spends tens of millions of dollars each year aimed, in its own words, at ''helping to improve people's lives through health and learning.'' In addition to making a sweeping effort to vaccinate the world's children, it has backed charities like Cancer Lifeline, which provides support to people with cancer and their families, and the American Cancer Society.</p>
        <p>But according to its most recent tax return, the Gates Foundation also owned bonds in Philip Morris, the tobacco company -- raising the issue of whether the foundation's behavior as an investor sometimes runs counter to its charitable mission.</p>
        <p>''If you believe tobacco kills, and you are concerned about health, it would seem absurd to hold tobacco stocks in your portfolio,'' said Stephen Viederman, a longtime foundation executive who has waged a tireless battle to persuade more of these charities to rethink their investments in light of their social aims.</p>
        <p>Yet at a time when many foundations are benefiting from a huge run-up in stocks -- and as socially responsible investing has proven to be a successful bull-market strategy -- few foundations have been quick to adopt Mr. Viederman's approach.</p>
        <p>To be sure, a smattering of foundations are active as shareholders. But many more view their sole responsibility as maximizing returns so that they can give away more money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Viederman and a handful of others, however, contend that foundations are also obligated to consider, as he puts it, ''the social and environmental consequences of their investments.''</p>
        <p>The $90 million endowment that Mr. Viederman led until recently, the Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation, based in Manhattan,  screens its portfolio for investments that might conflict with its goal of protecting the environment. It declines, for example, to invest in companies like Dow Chemical and Monsanto.</p>
        <p>''You would think that foundations have a clear mission in social policy issues and would look at the portfolio as another tool they could use, but by and large they don't,'' said Scott Fenn, the executive director of the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a Washington group that advises large shareholders on corporate governance and social issues.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Gates Foundation declined to comment about its thinking on socially responsible investing.</p>
        <p>While most efforts to use investments to further social goals are associated with liberal causes, the concept is not tied to a specific ideology. A foundation that disapproved of abortion, for example, might refuse to own stocks of health care companies whose hospitals performed abortions.</p>
        <p>But conservative foundations also tend to neglect their missions when investing their endowments, according to Leslie Lenkowsky, a professor at the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy and former president of the conservative Hudson Institute.</p>
        <p>''The trustees of conservative foundations tend to be interested in maximizing the returns of their assets,'' he said -- and are not likely to favor shareholder activism as a tool for change.</p>
        <p>AT most foundations, in fact, there has been a historical separation between who decides which causes to support and who decides how to invest the endowment. The second group, more comfortable with finance than advocacy, has focused exclusively on investment returns, resisting the idea of investing with other goals in mind.</p>
        <p>Advocates of socially responsible investing argue that foundations are ignoring their influence as shareholders.</p>
        <p>''If you have a large endowment, the power of that money to create change is probably more than the power of your grant-making,'' said Jill Ratner, president of the Rose Foundation for Communities and the Environment, based in Oakland, Calif. The foundation, with about $1 million in assets, has taken an activist stance as a shareholder in Maxxam Inc., the Houston natural resources company; critics say Maxxam has logged old-growth forests and has a poor relationship with labor.</p>
        <p>Because their endowments typically dwarf the grants that these charities make, Ms. Ratner said foundations should think more about the corpus, or principal, of their portfolio than the investment income they give away. ''What you have at a lot of foundations are people trying to use their earnings to basically bet against their corpus,'' she said. ''It's weighted the wrong way.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, the Rose Foundation joined with the United Steelworkers of America to push for the election of independent directors to Maxxam's board, asserting that if the company were better governed, its record on environmental and labor issues would improve. Charles Hurwitz, the company's chief executive, has voting control, and the proposal was defeated in May.</p>
        <p>About $1 of every $8 under professional management -- some $2 trillion over all -- was involved in socially responsible investing last year, according to the Social Investment Forum, a Washington group that surveys the landscape every two years. That sum, the bulk of it invested under social screens, has roughly doubled from 1997.</p>
        <p>The concept has grown in popularity among individual investors. Well-known investment managers like the Vanguard Group and TIAA-CREF recently began offering mutual funds with holdings screened for social considerations.</p>
        <p>In the past, many people worried that issue-minded investing damaged investment performance. But there is a growing consensus that other influences -- like the sectors and companies in a portfolio -- may have greater impact on returns.</p>
        <p>Moreover, some money managers who screen holdings for financial considerations, like those who run the Domini Social Equity fund, can now boast a performance history that closely matches the overall market. Over the last five years, Domini has returned 25.2 percent a year, on average, versus 24.6 percent for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. Like the S&amp; P, the fund is weighted toward the technology stocks that have led the market the last few years.</p>
        <p>Still, foundations, especially larger  ones, have not been in the forefront of the social investing movement.</p>
        <p>When it last surveyed its membership in 1997, the Council on Foundations found that slightly less than 15 percent screened for any social or ethical consideration. Small foundations, those with assets of less than $10 million, were almost twice as likely to do so as large ones, those with assets of $100 million or more, according to the survey.</p>
        <p>While many foundations were active in dissuading companies from doing business in South Africa in the 1970's and 80's, subsequent causes do not appear to have captured their interest. Even the movement among large investors like state pension funds to divest their portfolios of tobacco stocks has not won many foundations' favor, although a few-high profile ones -- like the nearly $9 billion Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the $3 billion Charles Stewart Mott Foundation -- have rid their endowments of those stocks.</p>
        <p>By contrast, some of the largest foundations, like the Gates fund and the $13 billion Ford Foundation, invested in these stocks, according to the latest tax returns. So did relatively big foundations whose primary aim is to improve the health of Americans, like the $525 million Commonwealth Fund in New York.</p>
        <p>''We feel our energies are better spent on our grant-making,'' explained Michael C. Vachon, Commonwealth's director of communications. Commonwealth has supported programs intended to improve health care for minorities and to increase health insurance coverage and access to care for working Americans. The impact of divesting its portfolio of tobacco stocks would be ''minimal,'' Mr. Vachon said.</p>
        <p>UNLIKE other large investors -- including colleges and state pension funds -- foundations  have been all but immune to public pressure, despite having amassed nearly $400 billion in assets, according to 1998 figures, the most recent available. Organizations that receive their grants do not want to endanger future aid; staff members tend not to have the power to force the issue. And to date, many activists seem unaware of the divergence between foundations' grant-making and their investments.</p>
        <p>The foundation world has been truly left alone,'' said Matthew Myers,  president of the National Center for Tobacco-free Kids, in Washington.</p>
        <p>Foundations have also chosen not to model themselves after pension funds as shareholder activists, only rarely proposing shareholder resolutions urging a company to improve its business practices.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1990's, the Noyes Foundation and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility established the Foundation Partnership on Corporate Responsibility to involve more endowments in shareholder activism. Only a dozen or so foundations, however, were sponsors or co-sponsors of shareholder resolutions within the last year.</p>
        <p>''We have not gotten behind the force of the portfolio,'' acknowledged William S. White, president of the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation in Flint, Mich. While Mott, which invests its endowment without the aid of outside managers, pays attention to proxy matters, it does not view its  $3 billion in assets as a way to accomplish change at companies that prove themselves to be poor corporate citizens.</p>
        <p>''We feel the market has a way of getting at some of these issues,'' Mr. White said.</p>
        <p>Some foundations are leery of devoting much in the way of staff or time to shareholder issues, and activism rarely rises to the level of debate. ''Most foundations still put a Chinese wall between their investment arms and their grant-making arms,'' said Doug Cogan, the deputy director of the social issues service of the Investor Responsibility Research Center.</p>
        <p>Many social activists argue that selling a holding should be a last resort, preferring to use their shareholdings within the system to effect change. Indeed, some foundations that have undertaken shareholder activism say they have had an impact.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1990's, for example, the Noyes Foundation started working closely with one of its grantees, the SouthWest Organizing Project, a community group in Albuquerque, to put pressure on the Intel Corporation to weigh environmental and employment concerns about plans to expand its chip-making operations in New Mexico.</p>
        <p>Noyes, which owned 100 shares of Intel stock, filed two shareholder proposals that it says led to discussions between Intel and community activists about the impact of the company's actions. Intel eventually changed its environmental, health and safety policy to commit to more  dialogue with communities housing its facilities, and Noyes withdrew its second shareholder proposal.</p>
        <p>Activists say the presence of a foundation in such discussions can make a difference by convincing executives that there is a broader group of institutions concerned about their behavior. ''The acoustics change with a company,'' said Timothy Smith, the director of the Interfaith Center.</p>
        <p>BUT most foundations, beyond choosing not to sponsor shareholder resolutions, have remained largely silent on many of the proposals put forward by other investors, from measures pressing Home Depot to stop using old-growth wood to resolutions urging Sara Lee to avoid genetically modified food.</p>
        <p>Even Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie, the three foundations that helped create the Investor Research Responsibility Center in 1972, say little publicly about their current roles as shareholders. People who follow shareholder campaigns say all three foundations appear to take their voting responsibilities seriously, but not one was willing to talk in detail about how it votes its proxies.</p>
        <p>''The key question to be raised is how best to engage corporate leadership,'' said Alexander W. Wilde, a spokesman for the Ford Foundation. While Ford will write privately to companies from time to time, he said, in addition to voting on shareholder issues, it prefers to work with companies on charitable programs rather than engage them through its ownership of their shares.</p>
        <p>Some big foundations, like the Commonwealth Fund, do not even vote their shares, leaving the task to their investment managers. Others, like the $13 billion David and Lucile Packard Foundation, invest much of their money in pooled index funds, which means that they cannot vote their shares.</p>
        <p>''I think that is a tremendous lost opportunity,'' said Robert Massey, executive director of the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies, which works with investors to improve corporations' environmental records.</p>
        <p>While many foundation officials say they believe that their fiduciary duty lies in trying to maximize returns, some advocates of social investing go so far as to argue that these endowments have a legal obligation to consider their mission when making investment decisions.</p>
        <p>''It is not a question you can disregard,'' said William McKeown, a New York lawyer who specializes in nonprofit law. ''Fiduciaries have a responsibility to carry out the purpose of the organization.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 2, 2000, Sunday  An article on June 11 about the investments made by foundations described the endowment of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation incorrectly. The vast majority of it is invested in the stock of Hewlett-Packard and Agilent Technologies; less than 1 percent is in an index fund.</p>
