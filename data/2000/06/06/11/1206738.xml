        <p>Homeowners, exterminators and hardware stores scrambled to read the fine print on bug-spray labels after the Environmental Protection Agency announced that chlorpyrifos, one of the most popular ingredients in household insecticides, would be banned for home, lawn and garden use.</p>
        <p>The agency found that chlorpyrifos, also known by the trade names Dursban and Lorsban, caused brain damage in newborn rats and an unacceptable rate of ailments in children. Manufacturers agreed to stop making the chemical for uses outside farms by the end of the year, and agreed to curtail its use on grapes, apples and tomatoes.</p>
