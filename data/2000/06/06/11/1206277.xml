        <p>In the next decade, a baby's first checkup won't be in the pediatrician's office. It will be in the petri dish while she's an eight-cell embryo no bigger than a dust speck.</p>
        <p>We are a long way from designing children with button noses, blond hair and 150 I.Q.'s. But by 2010, geneticists say they'll be able to predict babies' propensities for many of the diseases we dread most: breast, colon and prostate cancer, heart disease, diabetes.</p>
        <p>The key will be a DNA chip. With one amplified droplet of DNA, a thumbnail-size chip will be able to vet embryos for hundreds of genetic diseases.</p>
        <p>The rudiments of embryo screening exist today in a rare procedure called preimplantation genetic diagnosis, or P.G.D. At a handful of labs, doctors can diagnose certain genetic diseases in an embryo before deciding whether to implant the embryo in the womb. Candidates for P.G.D. are usually families who already have a child suffering a severe genetic illness or who have aborted a fetus after learning of a gene mutation. But the procedure is expensive (about $12,000 to $15,000, including the cost of in vitro fertilization) and time-consuming. After a woman's eggs are removed from her ovaries and fertilized, a geneticist punctures each egg's coating and, with a glass needle, sucks out an embryo cell one-seventh the width of a hair. The geneticist then isolates a specific gene, amplifies it and looks for the presence or absence of a mutation.</p>
        <p>P.G.D. is still in its infancy: geneticists analyze only one gene at a time, and there are only several dozen tests available -- sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, fragile X syndrome among them -- most of which are for severe childhood disorders. But two coming advances promise to change that. Over the next decade, according to Dr. Charles Strom, director of medical genetics at the Illinois Masonic Medical Center in Chicago, research will usher in hundreds of new tests for genetic diseases, including adult-onset illnesses like various cancers, Alzheimer's, hypertension, kidney disease and schizophrenia. And by that time, labs expect to have DNA chips capable of reading hundreds or even thousands of genes simultaneously from a single embryo cell. The result: it will ultimately be as easy and inexpensive to run several hundred genetic tests as one.</p>
        <p>Based on current biochip technology, the dime-size chip will resemble a computer circuit board with an intricate maze of gene patterns for diseases. When the embryo's DNA binds to a specific pattern, that segment of the chip will change color (from, say, red to green) -- signaling an aberrant gene sequence. A scanner will then read the matched patterns and feed the results to a computer. In minutes, the computer will spit out the embryo's genetic report card.</p>
        <p>Consumers for P.G.D. will presumably grow incrementally. Expectant parents who have tested positive for specific gene mutations will sign on first, then infertile couples undergoing in vitro fertilization and eventually, couples capable of traditional baby-making. ''There's a group of parents who will say to themselves: 'The old ways of giving birth were risky and we're not going to take those risks. We've got to do I.V.F. and do the best we can for our kid,''' says Philip Kitcher, author of ''The Lives to Come: The Genetic Revolution and Human Possibilities'' and a professor of philosophy at Columbia. And by the 22nd century, doing the best for your kid may include gene therapy -- or ''fixing'' the imperfect eggs by replacing bad genes with good ones. For the near future, however, expectant parents may wrestle with these genetic forecasts. Since everyone carries at least several mutations, no embryo will emerge from DNA screening with a perfect score. And most mutations suggest a propensity, not a guarantee, for a disease. So, how to choose? Which embryo is preferable -- the one with a likelihood for colon cancer or the one with a propensity for diabetes? And what about the embryo with a breast cancer gene? Keep it and hope for a cure? Or toss the whole batch and start over again? The preoccupations of today's parents about car seats, strollers and breast-feeding will seem quaint by comparison.</p>
