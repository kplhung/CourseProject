        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I have been in the Army for more than 19 years and have served in a variety of positions working with soldiers of every race and religion.</p>
        <p>You found two leaders who fail to take responsibility for their own shortcomings (front page, June 7). ''I didn't get promoted because I was the wrong color'' or ''I'm being transferred because I am black'' are easy excuses for people afraid to look in the mirror for the real reasons. If you want to see the Army's success story on race relations, you could have found plenty of soldiers -- black, white, Asian and Hispanic -- working together!</p>
        <p>RICHARD P. WALLACE  Carbondale, Ill., June 8, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a sergeant first class in the Army ROTC at Southern Illinois University.</p>
