        <p>''Stores are open while NYC Transit replaces the elevators.''</p>
        <p>So state the signs posted outside a small arcade of shops, in hopes of catching the eye of people walking down Henry and Clark Streets.</p>
        <p>But signs don't pay bills, as Salahaddin Aziz, owner of Asad News, has discovered.</p>
        <p>His store, like four others in the arcade, has no door onto the sidewalk outside. And when the Clark Street subway station closed in late April for four months of elevator work in response to years of complaints about poor service, the steady stream of shoppers his business relied on ebbed away.</p>
        <p>''I'm doing very bad,'' Mr. Aziz said on a recent weekday as he stood in the silent arcade. ''I've lost 60 percent of my business.''</p>
        <p>As if that weren't bad enough, his shop was burglarized last week for the first time since he started working there 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>''It's because there's no foot traffic, nobody here in the nighttime,'' he said. ''In the first four weeks I lost $5,000. Now they broke my gate and took $5,000 of stuff.'' He added that he was putting in his own money to keep the business afloat.</p>
        <p>Across the way, Thomas LaMarca stood idly outside his barbershop.</p>
        <p>''We don't sell any products any more,'' he said. He pointed at the coffee shop across the way, its iron gate pulled down ever since its owner closed shop the week after subway service stopped.</p>
        <p>''He said he was going to go back up three months later, when the train opens,'' Mr. LaMarca said.</p>
        <p>Merchants said they hoped the owners of the St. George Hotel, which houses the arcade, will consider rent abatements to get them through the lean months.</p>
        <p>''I think maybe the landlord has a nice heart and maybe he'll help,'' said Alex Ustayev, who owns a shoe repair shop in the arcade.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Mr. Ustayev is testing strategies to attract customers.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I go outside with a few things,'' he said. ''Shoestrings, umbrellas. Then, people buy.''</p>
