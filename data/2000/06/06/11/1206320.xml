        <p>ONE of my favorite records last year was an album that virtually nobody in the United States has heard and one that will be difficult for most people to find there. It's called ''Stadtansichten,'' a various-artists compilation on the Berlin-based MFS label. It's an album of what could be called electronic dance music, a genre the music industry in America has saddled with the unfortunate moniker of electronica in an effort to get people to buy it without thinking of words like disco or techno, which seem to have an unfortunate effect in the marketplace.</p>
        <p>The target audience for electronica, however, is not, I believe, the only one which would enjoy it. It's easy enough to aim this music at the small number of young people who go to what are still called ''raves'' in America (the term has long since fallen out of use in Europe), as well as to the more adventurous critics and fans in an increasingly fragmented music scene, but even among enthusiastic listeners, this particular album lacks star-power.</p>

        <p>ONE of my favorite records last year was an album that virtually nobody in the United States has heard and one that will be difficult for most people to find there. It's called ''Stadtansichten,'' a various-artists compilation on the Berlin-based MFS label. It's an album of what could be called electronic dance music, a genre the music industry in America has saddled with the unfortunate moniker of electronica in an effort to get people to buy it without thinking of words like disco or techno, which seem to have an unfortunate effect in the marketplace.</p>
        <p>The target audience for electronica, however, is not, I believe, the only one which would enjoy it. It's easy enough to aim this music at the small number of young people who go to what are still called ''raves'' in America (the term has long since fallen out of use in Europe), as well as to the more adventurous critics and fans in an increasingly fragmented music scene, but even among enthusiastic listeners, this particular album lacks star-power.</p>
        <p>''Stadtansichten'' (the name is German for city views) is a 77-minute nonstop D.J. mix of 19 pieces that, in their original form, were made for dancing, but it is an album intended to be listened to. The mix was created live in the studio by an artist who calls himself Corvin Dalek. Each track has been specially treated, remixed, for home listening, and Mr. Dalek has sequenced them so that they fit seamlessly together, much as a D.J. at a club would do, even to the point that if you leave your CD player on repeat, the last track becomes the first track. But it's not an attempt to replicate a night in a club, as so many mix albums are; the album is best heard in your living room or car.</p>
        <p>It's also a clear statement of purpose for MFS, a small label trying to stand out in a field in which upwards of 200 singles are released each week. (I've been aware of MFS from its start because its head, Mark Reeder, a British man who has lived in Berlin for many years, was one of the first people I met on my first visit here. At the time he was co-owner of a bar where most of my friends hung out.) Mr. Reeder has an interesting history: soon after he moved to Berlin, his childhood friend Bernard Sumner called to tell him that on the eve of a first American tour, the lead singer of his band, Joy Division, had hanged himself. Mr. Reeder invited Mr. Sumner to Berlin, and while he was there played him an early electronic dance record, Donna Summer's ''I Feel Love,'' produced by Giorgio Moroder in Munich. Mr. Sumner returned to England with new ideas and reconfigured the band, which, as New Order, pioneered a mix of rock and electronics that made it one of the biggest acts in 1980's England.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reeder was also inspired and found himself on the ground floor of a Berlin-based musical movement that recognized the implications of the work of some black Detroiters who called their music techno. By 1990, it had become the sound of Berlin, as club-goers swarmed to the abandoned buildings in the city's eastern half where they set up underground clubs like E-Werk, Tresor and WMF. Mr. Reeder had been producing records for the former East German pop label Amiga, and formed his own label under its corporate umbrella. He named the label MFS, an apparent reference to the Ministerium fur Staatsicherheit, the East German secret police, although he maintained it stood for Masterminded for Success.</p>
        <p>Success, so far, has eluded MFS. (Its Web site is www.mfs-berlin.de, and the label is distributed in the United States through Intergroove, a wholesaler specializing in dance records.) The label's first popular artist, who used the stage name Cosmic Baby, quit the label after promises of big money from his new manager and disappeared from sight. As the label grew, it acquired a brilliant young talent, Paul van Dyk, an East German youngster whose work was capable of an almost Schubertian lyricism and who, after several years, was becoming a star throughout Europe, particularly in England. He, too, left last year, taking Mr. Reeder's long-time business partner with him. MFS is a niche player in the world of dance music; it has never really had a pop hit, although its albums sell consistently year after year, a rarity for the genre.</p>
        <p>In a field obsessed with nomenclature, MFS's releases have been relegated to the trance-techno category, a term that neither Mr. Reeder nor I understand. There is, however, an overriding aesthetic that is clearly audible on ''Stadtansichten,'' and that's what makes the music accessible to more than the specialists. Its hallmark is, as with Mr. van Dyk's music, lyricism, albeit not always of the standard melodic variety. Indeed, tonality itself can be subservient to rhythm in this music, which can seem unsettling. One has to accustom oneself to the minute variations in the texture of the pulse as each eight-bar section adds or subtracts something from the charging rhythm in many of these pieces. But once one has accomplished this, the magnetic pull of the beat and the inventiveness of the layering of events becomes hypnotic.</p>
        <p>If there is a signature MFS moment on the album, it's ''Dark Blue,'' by Cabala, an Englishman named Nick Muir. It starts as pure rhythm (although Mr. Dalek's mixing has something to do with this), but eventually bits of what might be a chord progression start to appear, a fragment of a bass line, a bit of tone which lingers. Suddenly, everything stops, and a sine-wave melody, catchy and almost too sentimentally romantic, sweeps in. The rhythm creeps back, supported by chords, and when the melody returns, it's anthemic, again, almost overly so. Finally it recedes as Mr. Dalek sets up the next track, and we're off into another space entirely.</p>
        <p>THERE is, however, more to the label and this album than ''Dark Blue'': rhythmic workouts like Cal-Q-Lator's ''Can We Go Now?'' (in two totally different versions) and Mr. Dalek's ''Pounds and Penz'' provide an adrenaline rush not unlike the best hard rock; Kama Arts' ''Sun-Shine-Sun-Set'' is almost a parody of a disco number from a blaxploitation film; Cybersecrecy's ''Your Eyes Make Me Feel so Good'' is lush with electronic ''orchestration'' and Cosmonaut's ''Parovoz'' has train whistles and a Commie-kitsch male choir interlude.</p>
        <p>But in addition to all of this are the astonishing soundscapes and the varied textural palette these young musicians use in creating them. I enjoy playing this music for Americans, 35 and older, who have never been exposed to it. They're the ones who most frequently complain about the sterility and uninventiveness of the popular music they're exposed to, and they find that this stuff pushes buttons that everything from the best progressive rock to the flimsy new wave pop of the 1980's had previously pushed. And, since most of us either can't get past the door at the clubs where this music is played (assuming we're somewhere where it is played), or can't stay up until they really get going (around 3 a.m. in Berlin), albums like this (and like the Belgian label SSR's Freezone series) are the only way we get to hear it.</p>
        <p>''Stadtansichten'' isn't a comprehensive overview of the electronic music scene of the moment. That would require a 10-disc boxed set. It is, however, an uplifting and energizing collection of adventurous, exciting sounds by people who fully communicate to listeners the joy of making them. Given the anemic state of too much of today's pop music, that's really all I can ask for.</p>
