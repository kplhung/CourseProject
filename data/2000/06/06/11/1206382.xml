        <p>IN Manhattan, whether along West End Avenue or on the side streets off Park, therapists' offices are likely to be dim caves on the ground floor of prewar apartment buildings, distinguished only by decor, some with comfy upholstery and others with leather and chrome.</p>
        <p>But in Westchester, going to the shrink is a house tour, from the ginger-bready Victorians near Long Island Sound in Larchmont to the stark glass-and-cedar contemporaries in the woods of Katonah, where home offices have been carved in basements or attics.</p>
        <p>Instead of being unilaterally under the professional microscope, these at-home sessions give the patient plenty to ponder. There is a dog's leash slung over the bannister, flats of annuals waiting to be planted, unread newspapers in a pile. All so personal compared with magazines in a Manhattan waiting room.</p>
        <p>Is that woman pulling down the driveway in an S.U.V. the therapist's wife (Hmmm, expensive haircut, great clothes) or just another patient? The swing set in the backyard means children. (His, hers or theirs?) A kitchen renovation, glimpsed through an open door, is an encyclopedia of taste (linoleum vs. quarry tiles, Marcella Hazan vs. recipes from the Junior League, a Sub-Zero refrigerator or something from Sears.)</p>
        <p>Scheduling appointments is different here than in the city, too. There, you claim an hour and simply show up, except for the great void of August, when therapists and hairdressers conspire to vacate their confessionals at precisely the same time. But here in the high-end suburbs, therapists often split their time between a city and country office and patients get to choose. Or mix and match.</p>
        <p>Mix and match can be confusing. What if you show up on the Upper East Side when you're supposed to be in Westchester? You could spend a whole session, at $140 a pop, talking about the deeper meaning of your mistake. And what if the therapist is at the wrong office? Grist for 50 minutes on the subject of abandonment.</p>
        <p>Mix and match also provides different opportunities for retail therapy, surely an indulgence on the same day as the on-the-couch kind. In Westchester, a cross-county journey takes a patient past Hay Day, a gourmet food store in Scarsdale, and Cherry Lawn, a nursery in New Rochelle, both so pricey it helps to have a mortgage before filling a cart.</p>
        <p>Manhattan is less dangerous, perhaps because one hour in a parking garage discourages further spending. What a quick swoop to the city allows, for ex-urbanites who long for a Chinese menu shoved under their door, is take-out from Empire Szechwan. Or a weekly fix from Fairway in Harlem, a warehouse of delicacies beyond Stew Leonard's palate.</p>
        <p>Fairway is a quick detour off the West Side Highway for those on the Hudson River side of the county. And therein lies another wrinkle in the geography of therapy in the suburbs, analogous to the great dichotomy in Manhattan between East Side and West Side.</p>
        <p>From the Hudson River to Long Island Sound is seven miles as the crow flies. But as anybody who lives in these parts will tell you, you can barely get there from here. A half-dozen highways, from verdant parkways to thruways thick with truck fumes, connect New York City to the northern suburbs. But going east to west is another matter.</p>
        <p>The middle of the county is a lush landscape of golf courses, estates and farm stands. What is missing are roads. Oh, it is possible to loop south to the Cross County Parkway and then head north on the Hutch. Or do the same thing in reverse by heading up to the Cross Westchester. Some prefer the maze of surface streets that dog-leg mysteriously, change names at the drop of a hat and leave an inexperienced motorist tangled in the Hagstrom's foldout map.</p>
        <p>This cross-county trip can usually be avoided. Why buy a car on the Boston Post Road when the same dealers have outposts in Bedford or Yonkers? Why ice skate in Mamaroneck when there's a rink in Ardsley?</p>
        <p>But therapy is different. Chemistry trumps geography. So set your odometer and stopwatch. The Rivertowns to the Upper East Side takes half an hour, for instance, 10 minutes less than the trip to Larchmont. No maps necessary. No choices other than whether to cross Central Park at 96th or 81st Street. Or whether to order ginger chicken or aromatic eggplant.</p>
