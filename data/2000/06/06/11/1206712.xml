        <p>Look out Emeril, here comes the Food Dude. He's Mike Colameco, a food broker from West Cape May by day and, by night -- at least this Tuesday at 10:30 p.m. on NJN -- the host of a food show. Mr. Colameco, who has worked in several top-end restaurant kitchens, says he is as interested in showing viewers where food is grown, where meat and fish come from as talking to chefs. His first episode, ''Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner,'' includes two New Jersey restaurants: the Summit Diner for breakfast and the Ryland Inn for a refined dinner and a talk with the chef, Craig Shelton, in his organic kitchen garden. (Lunch is at a Korean place in Manhattan). Mr. Dude comes off as a jovial Jersey Guy as excited about home fries as haute cuisine. He and his producer, Kirk Sohr, an NJN cameraman who lives in Maplewood, have made two other episodes that will be broadcast in late summer on Channel 13 during its Sunday afternoon food slot and they hope to get a whole series shown nationwide on public television.</p>
