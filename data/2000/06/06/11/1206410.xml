        <p>EVEN for seasoned tree experts like Lou Sebesta, an urban forester who has seen many champions, the 125-year-old flowering dogwood in Carmel is a wonder.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sebesta, who works for the State Department of Environmental Conservation, believes the tree is the new champion of its species for the state, although he is double-checking his records to make sure.</p>
        <p>By initial estimates, the dogwood, which graces the front lawn of a 19th-century farmhouse, scores 121, a rating based on measurements of the tree's circumference, height and crown spread. The current record holder for flowering dogwoods is in Lewis County, in the western Adirondacks. At last count it scored 101.</p>
        <p>The tree's precise age, however, can only be estimated, because to determine exact age, a boring must be conducted -- a procedure that leaves a tree vulnerable to disease and infestation.</p>
        <p>Nationally, a flowering dogwood in Norfolk, Va., is the largest of its species, according to the National Registry of Champion Big Trees and Famous and Historic Trees. The trunk of the Norfolk dogwood has a circumference of 110 inches.</p>
        <p>But Martin Brech, the chairman of Putnam's Tree Advisory Commission, is beaming because the dogwood is the first tree in his county to be listed on the state's Big Tree Register. Westchester already has six such trees -- a common apple, an American Basswood, an Eastern Hemlock, a Pin Oak, a Sassafras and a Yellow Poplar. The state does not publicize the locations of record holders to protect the trees from vandals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brech explained that the size of the Putnam tree -- 40 feet high and 70 inches in circumference measured at 4 1/2 feet off the ground -- is unusual for flowering dogwoods, which are most often confined in the understory of forests and therefore do not grow large.</p>
        <p>Over the long term, Mr. Brech is worried about the champion dogwood and predicts surgery will be necessary to save it. ''It has a fungal disease,'' he said, ''deep hollows that are rotted and stubs that need pruning.'' Also, a large branch is leaning out too far and could be severed in a storm. ''It badly needs work,'' Mr. Brech said.</p>
        <p>With proper care, though, the tree could thrive for 30 or more years, Mr. Sebesta said, adding a few do's and don'ts for those who want to protect large trees on their own properties. ''The worst thing is to park heavy equipment over a tree's root zone,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other tips: don't compact soil over a tree's roots, don't excavate near a tree you want to save (the roots spread two to three times the crown spread), don't change the grade of the soil around a tree and don't put chains or cables too tightly around the girth of a growing tree.</p>
        <p>Keep weed trimmers, lawn mowers, snow blowers and other equipment away from a tree's trunk.</p>
        <p>When mulching, do it lightly -- three inches at the most to prevent smothering the tree. ''This isn't rocket science,'' Mr. Sebesta said. ''It all makes perfect sense. You just want to protect the organisms that make up the tree.''</p>
