        <p>UNTIL recently, Glyndor House on the grounds of Wave Hill here was not a home as it had been in the early 1900's when the Georgian Revival building was occupied by an apparently energetic family. When the empty building began to undergo reconstruction, Wave Hill's art curator, Julia Waters, began to speculate about what living in the house might have been like.</p>
        <p>To inaugurate the new Glyndor Gallery, Ms. Waters devised ''Welcome.'' It's a sly title for a show in which 11 artists explore, as press material says, ''ideas of domestic space and the relationship between people and nature.'' It's an uneven affair -- a show of discrete objects relating to domesticity, which might be shown anywhere, but it also features a couple of installations in which particular rooms are transformed. Everything is well made and purposeful.</p>
        <p>Esperanza Cortes's multipart work ''Altar to Those Forgotten'' is a heap of unglazed clay roses along with exaggeratedly long thorns on a table put in front of an abstract painting. If viewers are literal minded, they can read its evanescent imagery as ascending souls, perhaps spirits of Wave Hill.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cortes might have handed off her theme to Lynn Yamamoto and her ''Long Twilight.'' Souls take on a bit more substance in the many chains of paper dolls that Ms. Yamamoto fixes on pleasant blue wallpaper decorated with leaves. The paper dolls, which sometimes rustle in breezes that waft through the room, are counterpoint to the wallpaper. They all have faint spots that were made, Ms. Waters said, by the touch of incense sticks applied by the artist's student assistants. This installation, which also contains a display cabinet full of items that refer to Japan, was originally made for the midtown Manhattan branch of the Whitney Museum. Although it is a bit truncated here, it is appropriate to its homey surroundings in its strange way. The show's title ''Welcome'' is challenged by this mildly haunting environment.</p>
        <p>Another installation is a demonstration of wit by Carol Sun. Without examining the details in her ''Transformation Parlor,'' viewers see a customary grouping of finely upholstered chairs on a thick carpet in the middle of the room. Decorative plates line the walls. It is the plates with their bold decoration -- variations on the theme of lock and keys -- that provide the first clues that this room is an homage to uptightness.  There are other painted forms of ominousness as well: a broken chain-link fence or, in the center of one plate, a drain.</p>
        <p>Viewers will then start to catch the more subtle decoration: locks and keys are woven into the carpet and distinguish the upholstery of the chairs. This room, with its many windows through which the sun might shine, is claustrophobic.</p>
        <p>Original wallpaper might be enough to define an installation: putting up wallpaper is like claiming territory. Francesco Simeti further jars the tranquillity of Glyndor House with patterns that incorporate images of conflict, the war in Kosovo and environmental disaster. In the latter case, vignettes of armies of men in spacesuit-like white protective clothing are especially unnerving.</p>
        <p>Wave Hill should be saluted for not being content merely to put ''mixed media'' on the labels for complex pieces involving several materials; rather, those materials are identified. Viewers might still occasionally be in the dark about what material is in which object, but figuring out the answer becomes a challenging game. The delicate plates in Carolynn Desch's ''No Thank You'' are cast from blue-tinted sugar. As entrancing as her plates and spoons might be, Ms. Desch's underlying message isn't obvious. She is presented as being interested in health and the process of aging. The sugar has a didactic purpose: glucose sustains life.</p>
        <p>In the same vein as Ms. Desch's work, but more sinister, are Elizabeth Newman's heavier objects, which take on surreal overtones. For instance, two large mortars with the requisite pestles are full of bead-like objects identified as wax. Viewers might get a certain visceral thrill imagining wax about to be pounded this way. Ms. Newman's largest work here is a couple of miniature beds hard by each other. One is labeled ''brother,''the other ''sister.'' What puts the work in the creepy category is the milk that has apparently been fed into the beds through tubes and has congealed there.</p>
        <p>Transformed pieces of furniture include a circular table whose top has discrete cut-out areas by Jean Blackburn. In the empty spaces, Ms. Blackburn has constructed skeletal structures, presumably with some of the same wood she had removed. The painter Ad Reinhardt is credited with defining art as ''anything that is useless,'' and Ms. Blackburn's machinations fulfill this requisite.</p>
        <p>Allan Wexler has rigged up an ordinary dining table with lights that are cast downward to shine on small plots of grass. The work is called ''Indoor Sukkah,'' referring to the booth built for the Jewish festival of the harvest. Wittiest are the two yarmulkes made from triangular pieces cut out of the tablecloth. David Hess transforms furniture very tastefully; the humble sticks and branches that go into a rustic chair, for example, might be made of precious cast bronze.</p>
        <p>Viewers must have fresh eyes to comb the mini-installation that David Baskin has put on the shelves of a built-in dining room cupboard, an element of the original Glyndor House. His primary material is the dolls and furnishings in Deborah Goldberg's childhood doll house, but he adds some local Wave Hill color.</p>
        <p>One might refresh oneself by stepping outdoors where Roberley Bell has put two giant urns covered in artificial turf and festooned with artificial flowers. Their lusciousness is a challenge to the acres of real, but less flamboyant, flowers in Wave Hill's gardens.</p>
        <p>''Welcome'' is at the Glyndor Gallery of Wave Hill in the Riverdale section of the Bronx through Aug. 20. The number to call for more information is (718) 549-3200.</p>
        <p>ART REVIEW  Correction:  June 25, 2000, Sunday  An art review on June 11 about a show called ''Welcome'' at the Glyndor House at Wave Hill in the Bronx misidentified the visual arts curator who devised the exhibit. She is Jennifer McGregor; Julia Waters is Wave Hill's assistant director of public relations.</p>
