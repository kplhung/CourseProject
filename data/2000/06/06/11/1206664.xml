        <p>Last Wednesday, before Commendable was due to draw a post position for the 132nd running of the Belmont Stakes, the colt's owner, Bob Lewis, made a phone call to D. Wayne Lukas. He wanted to know one thing before he committed Commendable to the mile-and-a-half marathon.</p>

        <p>Last Wednesday, before Commendable was due to draw a post position for the 132nd running of the Belmont Stakes, the colt's owner, Bob Lewis, made a phone call to D. Wayne Lukas. He wanted to know one thing before he committed Commendable to the mile-and-a-half marathon.</p>
        <p>'' 'Wayne, are you sure we're doing the right thing?' '' Lewis remembered asking the Hall of Fame trainer. ''I wasn't so sure.''</p>
        <p>It was a valid question considering how cruel this $1 million race has been to Bob and Beverly Lewis in recent years. In 1997, Silver Charm vanquished Kentucky Derby and Preakness fields only to see a Triple Crown sweep vanish when Touch Gold ground down the gray in the last 50 yards to win the race by three-quarters of a length.</p>
        <p>Last year was even more heart-wrenching when Charismatic came to this grand old track on the verge of Triple Crown history only to fracture his foreleg at the top of the turn and gamely hold on for third place.</p>
        <p>Commendable was an afterthought of the Southern California couple. Sure, they had paid $575,000 for him in 1998 at the Keeneland July sale. Sure, he had demolished a maiden field last summer at Delmar.</p>
        <p>But all that promise was sidelined when Commendable sustained a leg injury last fall and was given time off to convalesce. When the son of Gone West finally returned to the races in February, he finished fifth, then fourth, then fourth again, and again. Still, on the first Saturday in May, the Lewises and Lukas started him in the Kentucky Derby -- again as an afterthought. High Yield was the real Derby horse for the owners and trainer.</p>
        <p>Commendable finished 17th -- a binoculars-challenged 26 lengths behind the Derby-winning Fusaichi Pegasus, but only a few lengths behind High Yield. Lukas and the Lewises pretty much thought this Triple Crown season was not likely to be theirs.</p>
        <p>''I don't have any grandiose ideas about sweeping this thing,'' Lukas acknowledged earlier in the week at his barn on Belmont's back side. ''He is talented, but he really hasn't performed.''</p>
        <p>Still, with Fusaichi Pegasus and the Preakness winner Red Bullet out of the race, Lukas scouted his likely competition and ultimately shrugged and asked why not. There wasn't a Grade I winner in the 11-horse field. Like Commendable, the favorites Aptitude and Impeachment had only one lifetime victory. Last fall, Lukas told Lewis that yes, Commendable, was his third-string Derby horse behind High Yield and Exchange Rate, but he suspected that the colt would like the extra ground and sweeping turns at Belmont.</p>
        <p>''I believed we could have a say in the race,'' Lukas finally decided.</p>
        <p>Even Lukas's wife, Laura, wasn't so sure. As late as yesterday morning, she asked her husband if he really believed Commendable could win the Belmont.</p>
        <p>''Absolutely,'' he said and explained that the colt worked fast and professionally in the morning. ''If I can get the same thing in the afternoon I get in the morning we can win.''</p>
        <p>By 5:31 p.m. yesterday, the Lewises, Lukas's wife and a crowd of 67,817 who let the unaccomplished colt go off at better than 18-1 got all their questions answered. Pat Day loped Commendable into the lead on the far turn, let him stretch his legs to a two-and-half-length lead at the top of the stretch and held on to give the Lewises a first-rate victory with their third-string horse.</p>
        <p>''The heartaches, the trials of the Triple Crown, -- this erases all that,'' Bob Lewis said.</p>
        <p>The lesson? For Day, who notched his third Belmont, there was just one.</p>
        <p>''You can't count Mr. Lukas out of the classic races,'' Day said. ''He has the courage to put his horses in the big races and take a shot with them.''</p>
        <p>Even Lukas allowed that was about all he did with Commendable. It was his fourth Belmont victory and his 13th Triple Crown victory which tied him at the top of a list with Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons. When Charismatic won last year's Derby at nearly twice the price of Commendable, Lukas rightfully crowed afterward that he had predicted victory for the one-time claimer in the days leading up to the race.</p>
        <p>There were no ''I-told-you-so'' statements yesterday. Just a smile and a nod to luck.</p>
        <p>''You have to have undying confidence in what you're doing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lukas did, Day believed, and the Lewises finally have a Belmont winner.</p>
