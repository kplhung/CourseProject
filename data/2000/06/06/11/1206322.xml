        <p>IMAGINE a Grammy Awards show in which every musical segment before the grand finale was devoted to field hollers: century-old songs that hark back directly to African music.

        <p>The rumba at Cubadisco wasn't the south-of-the-border pop ''rhumba'' of Fred Astaire dance numbers, or the driving, brassy big-band rumba of Tito Puente or the lilting guitar rumbas of Congolese soukous. Nor was it the ''son,'' the style that has reached its latest international audience through the Buena Vista Social Club.

        <p>IMAGINE a Grammy Awards show in which every musical segment before the grand finale was devoted to field hollers: century-old songs that hark back directly to African music. Audiences would be startled, wondering why anything so antique was on the air; recording companies would chafe because they'd want to promote more current styles. But when Cuba's annual awards for recordings, the Cubadisco prizes, were given out on May 24 at the Teatro Nacional here, there were roars of applause for group after group playing rumba, the style at the deepest roots of Cuban music.</p>
        <p>The rumba at Cubadisco wasn't the south-of-the-border pop ''rhumba'' of Fred Astaire dance numbers, or the driving, brassy big-band rumba of Tito Puente or the lilting guitar rumbas of Congolese soukous. Nor was it the ''son,'' the style that has reached its latest international audience through the Buena Vista Social Club. It was the unadorned propulsion for all of them: the kinetic sound of sputtering, snapping percussion with voices arching over the beat, propelling dancers whose crouching, hip-swiveling moves have been traced back to Africa.</p>
        <p>Unlike the field holler or rural blues in the United States, rumba in Cuba is still contemporary music. ''What is Cuba?'' said Oderquis Reve, who leads the band Oderquis Reve y su Changui. ''Sugar cane, rum and rumba.''</p>
        <p>Yet dedicated fans say rumba has been hiding in plain earshot, acknowledged but ignored. Musicians and aficionados believe that the rumba is underappreciated because it began as, and remains, the music of the poorest and darkest-skinned Cubans. ''The rumba has been mistreated by history,'' said Diosdado Ramos, the director of Los Munequitos de Matanzas, which has been playing traditionalist rumba since 1952. ''That's because it has always been the music of the poorest people, the most humble people, the black people, the drunks.''</p>
        <p>By making rumba its theme, Cubadisco 2000 sought to pull rumba in from the margins. Along with the awards show, the annual Cubadisco is a showcase for Cuban music to the outside world. Cubadisco presents a music-business convention along with performances in clubs, theaters, parks and the Pabexpo convention hall. This year, Cubadisco also sponsored an academic symposium on the rumba, with musicologists and musicians giving papers on everything from the rumba's lesser-known African roots to its new influx of female drummers.</p>
        <p>Caridad Diez, a musicologist who is the head of artists and repertory at the Bis Music recording company, had initially proposed that Cubadisco 2000 make rumba its theme. ''We want to expand people's thinking about the rumba inside and outside Cuba,'' she said. ''The rumba needs a place in the media. We don't want to impose anything, we just want to open everybody's eyes and ears and senses to know that the rumba exists. Many people don't know where elements of the music came from, and they came from the rumba.''</p>
        <p>To underscore the rumba's legitimacy, a concert with the revered Cuban composer Leo Brouwer conducting Carl Orff's ''Carmina Burana'' -- a European vision of a percussive, pagan ritual -- was followed by a rumba showcase in the park next to the concert hall. A procession of classical musicians and twirling, shimmying rumba dancers linked the two events.</p>
        <p>There was also an all-night rumba marathon at La Tropical, Havana's top outdoor dance hall, and an afternoon-long rumba showcase at Callejon de Hamel, an alleyway that has become an Afro-Cuban cultural center with bright murals, art galleries and a small outdoor stage. The cornucopia of rumba groups revealed not a folkloric music being carefully preserved by holdouts, but a vital, unregimented music that is still being invented.</p>
        <p>''The rumba is a process,'' said Jesus Perez, the leader of Odba Ilu. ''The chemistry keeps changing, but it's all rumba.''</p>
        <p>The rumba appeared in Cuba in the middle of the 19th century, when the slave trade was thriving here; slavery continued in Cuba until 1886, a generation after emancipation in the United States. In Cuba, unlike most parts of the United States, slaves were allowed to play drums, and they held on to sacred African songs and dances. They also developed secular songs for drums, percussion and voices that bemoaned problems -- romantic, social, philosophical -- and held on to community pride. African languages were replaced by the Spanish of Cuba's colonial rulers, and the melody lines adapted scales and contours from Spanish songs. ''It was the first moment of synthesis in Cuban music,'' said Alessandra Basso, a music researcher.</p>
        <p>That synthesis, in turn, seeded virtually all the Cuban music that followed, including son, guajira, guaracha, cha-cha-cha and the frenetic 1990's dance music called timba. It made its way, diluted, into cabaret shows, pop songs and Cuban classical compositions. It also spread to the world, reaching into music from Broadway to New Orleans rhythm-and-blues to disco to Spanish flamenco-pop to African guitar rock.</p>
        <p>In its traditional form, rumba is not a soothing heartbeat rhythm, like reggae, or a steady shuffle like the blues, to name two other African-American rhythms that have made the world dance. It is jumpy and syncopated at every level, starting with a constant clave pattern emphasizing offbeats -- three taps, then two -- and layering it with controlled explosions from congas and other percussion.</p>
        <p>The rumba embraces fractures and interruptions, with bursts of sound to answer singers and dancers with the speed of reflex. Instead of marking time like a clock, it traps time in a furious crossfire. For export, it had to be stabilized, with its percussion toned down and its improvisational melodies made symmetrical like pop songs.</p>
        <p>In Cuba, however, the oldest rumba rhythms -- particularly the popping fusillades that add up to the vintage rumba beat called guaguanco -- are ubiquitous. Los Munequitos de Matanzas are known nationwide, and sit in with salsa bands. Local rumba groups take over courtyards and streets for rumba parties across Havana on weekend afternoons.</p>
        <p>The percussive chatter of the rumba also crackles within songs by top Cuban bands like Los Van Van, founded in 1969, and newer bands like Charanga Forever and Paulito F. G. y su Elite. Their timba songs combine the blunt sexuality of hip-hop with anything it takes to keep a crowd in motion; riffing fast and jubilantly, the songs seem to metamorphose every 30 seconds. With its staccato horn jabs and its eruptions of keyboards and percussion, timba seems to map melodies onto the fastest-moving drumbeats of traditional rumba. ''Yo soy el poeta de la rumba'' (''I am the poet of the rumba'') sang Mario Rivera of Los Van Van, as horns and keyboards dropped away to reveal the fiercely pointillistic sputter of a rumba. ''Yo soy Cuba.''</p>
        <p>Like roots music everywhere, rumba now has to compete with the sleeker, more accessible pop styles it spawned. ''Rumba has not been a favorite of the media,'' said Ciro Benemelis, president of Cubadisco. ''That's because we have a positive problem here in Cuba. We have too many styles, too much good music.'' But traditional rumba also has image troubles because listeners don't forget where it comes from: the ''solar,'' loosely translated as slums.</p>
        <p>Giovani del Pino, leader of the rumba group Yoruba Andabo, said: ''There has always been prejudice against this music, and the prejudice remains. Radio and television don't speak of the rumba. Yet rumba is not just an expression of the 'solar' or of black people -- it's a manifestation of being Cuban.''</p>
        <p>Before the Cuban revolution in 1959, rumba received even less respect outside its own neighborhoods. The rhythm had worked its way into popular music, but its origins were ignored. The new Communist government established the Conjunto Folklorico Nacional to perform traditional music and dance, honoring vernacular culture. One rumba musician from the group told a researcher that only when he saw a poster announcing a show by ''Los artistas del Conjunto Folklorico'' did he realize he was an artist. Nowadays, rumba is part of the percussion curriculum in the state music schools that turn out Cuba's highly skilled musicians.</p>
        <p>Rumba has strong survival mechanisms. While some rumba groups, like Los Munequitos and Yoruba Andabo, have persevered for decades, new ones continue to form. In Cuba, musical genres don't seem to have expiration dates. Old styles like the son have never had to be self-consciously revived because groups still play them as a matter of course.</p>
        <p>Making connections to the drumming and singing of the Yoruba, Afro-Cuban rituals of Santeria has also helped preserve the rumba. Santeria is widely practiced in Cuba, more openly in recent years. Where a hip-hop act in the United States might poll the crowd asking, ''Is Manhattan in the house? Is Brooklyn in the house?'' Cuban salsa bands ask for responses from worshipers of the Afro-Cuban pantheon: ''Children of Obatala? Of Elegua? Of Chango?'' Playing salsa at La Tropical, Oderquis Reve y su Changui combined a census of Afro-Cuban deities with offerings for each one, tossing candies to the children of Elegua (a deity with a sweet tooth) and splashing water on children of Yemaya, the sea goddess. They ended the song with openly sexual rumba moves.</p>
        <p>Many rumba musicians also work as Santeria drummers, switching from congas to consecrated bata drums to perform at Afro-Cuban religious ceremonies. They can also join pop and salsa bands. And when they play traditionalist rumba, they find audiences among Cubans and, increasingly, among tourists who want a taste of old Cuba. The visitors may not realize that rumba, despite the low-tech simplicity of its drums-and-voices lineup, is by no means an archival genre, frozen in the past. The music has continued to evolve.</p>
        <p>HELIO OROVIO, author of the ''Diccionario de la Musica Cubana'' (Editorial Letras Cubanas, 1992), said that rumba is growing more elaborate and more flashy, starting in the last 30 years and accelerating through the 1990's. Where older rumba musicians were self-taught, learning from parents or neighbors, younger ones are likely to have conservatory training, and they're eager to show off all their technique instead of respectfully accompanying the singers. ''Sometimes,'' he said ruefully, ''they invent so much that they leave the roots behind.'' Since the 1990's, he noted, jazz flourishes have infiltrated the drumming, while elements of rap are moving into the vocals. And where an older rumba might have had one or two sections, newer ones often have five.</p>
        <p>Little is standardized in current rumba. The instrumentation might, or might not, include bata drums and bongo along with congas, cajones (wooden boxes), guagua (wood blocks), claves or tambourine; the staging might be casual or choreographed. At the all-night show at La Tropical, there were rumba groups dressed in white, like Santeria musicians, and in baseball shirts and baggy pants; there were dancers in street clothes and others with headdresses and tasseled bikinis like show girls. There were groups that started at breakneck tempos and then sped up; groups that deliberately brought out African-style vocal inflections and others that leaned toward the trumpet-like phrasing of salsa; even a group that sang an Islamic blessing.</p>
        <p>It was easy to hear a generational difference between the aggressive younger groups and Los Munequitos, whose rumbas moved with deliberation, holding back until an unstoppable momentum boiled up from within. But Los Munequitos aren't frozen in any era; while its dancers can do the shoulder-shaking, hip-grinding moves of classic rumba, they also do  slow-motion tumbling and what they call rumba-tap, clicking out rumba syncopations with tap shoes.</p>
        <p>After the Cubadisco awards, there was a late-night set at the Cafe Cantante by Charanga Panorama, a salsa group. It kicked into an uptempo song and suddenly, the dancers from Los Munequitos slipped onto the floor. Shoulders back and pelvises thrusting, they had found the ancient rumba rhythm within the salsa tune, and they danced as if they knew it would always be there.</p>
