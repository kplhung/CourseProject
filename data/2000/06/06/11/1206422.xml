        <p>THE 400 vacant lots and abandoned buildings that pockmark the streets of Plainfield are a sign of the difficulties experienced by this Union County city. Hurt by the exodus of residents and businesses in the 1960's, it has been struggling back ever since.</p>
        <p>Now the city is proceeding with a plan to rescue some of the 197 properties it has taken back or is taking back through foreclosure by designating a private developer to recycle 69 of them into 117 residences in 21 one-family and 48 two-family houses. New Century Homes of Westfield will develop the homes, which will be built in a factory in Scranton, Pa., and assembled on site.</p>
        <p>Last month, development started on the first home, a two-family house at 675-77 West Front Street. It will be used as a model to market the rest of the homes, which will be built as they are sold, said Arthur Fefferman, a partner in New Century Homes with Peter Weissbrod, Stuart Fuchsman and Richard Goldberger.</p>
        <p>Most of the lots, averaging 40 by 100 feet, are in the western part of the city, which suffered over the years from abandonment. The new two-story homes will blend with their neighbors in scale and price. The one-family houses will range from 1,366 to 1,489 square feet and sell for $129,900 to $139,900; the two-family homes will have 2,090 to 3,190 square feet and cost $169,900 to $179,900.</p>
        <p>''This is a public-private effort to produce housing for and bring the middle class back to Plainfield,'' Mr. Fefferman said, noting that he and his partners hoped to build similar projects in other cities.</p>
        <p>To keep the cost of the homes down, the city is selling the lots at a reasonable cost, he said. Also, market-rate mortgages with low down payments will be available to qualified buyers through several banks, including Fleet and Summit, Mr. Fefferman added. He said that Summit was providing construction financing for the $11 million project. The company also got a $500,000 grant from Union County.</p>
        <p>The project, said Albert T. McWilliams, Plainfield's mayor, will return the lots to the tax rolls, as well as remove ''eyesores from and improve the quality of life'' in the neighborhood. The added hope, he said, is that it will encourage property owners to improve their buildings and other developers to invest in the city.</p>
        <p>''Our dilemma is the rising cost of providing services in a city with a declining tax base,'' he said, adding that the way to close that gap was to raise taxes or bring in tax revenue. The sale of the lots is expected to generate $500,000 and their redevelopment to bring in $450,000 a year in tax revenue, said Patricia Ballard Fox, the deputy city administrator for economic development.</p>
        <p>OF the remaining 128 lots, the developers are in talks with the city for 10 more lots for 10 more homes, as well as for a four-acre parcel to develop a building with up to 60 apartments. Ms. Ballard Fox said the city planned to sell some of the rest of the lots to nonprofit developers for housing and keep some for open space. Still others are zoned for commercial use and will be redeveloped for that. There are 234 more lots in various stages of foreclosure that if taken back by the city will be brought into the redevelopment plan, Ms. Ballard Fox said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fefferman said he was hopeful that his company would develop 300 residences in Plainfield. Ms. Ballard Fox added that ''if the city works well with New Century Homes on the initial lots,'' it is likely that other sales would follow.</p>
        <p>The current 69-lot phase is the first sizable housing development in Plainfield in almost 15 years. And as part of the larger plan to recycle city-owned lots, the project is the first of nine redevelopment efforts planned to infuse new economic life into the city.</p>
        <p>Through the 1950's, Plainfield was the commercial hub of central New Jersey. In the 1960's, it, like other cities in the state, was hurt by racial riots, residential and  business flight and crime. The city's redevelopment history, which focused mostly on reviving its downtown, also has been checkered, leaving it seeking new residential and commercial uses.</p>
        <p>It is hoped that the nine redevelopment projects, which will produce 500,000 square feet of commercial space and at least 700 new and renovated homes by 2005, will  change that.</p>
        <p>''We want to set the stage for redevelopment before these economic boom times end,'' Ms. Ballard Fox said. Along with the New Century Homes development, the next two projects will be in the city's downtown and are expected to start by this fall, she said.</p>
        <p>One is the redevelopment of a four-acre tract bounded by Park and Madison Avenues and Front and Second Streets. The site has been used as park for the last decade after several earlier attempts at its redevelopment never materialized.</p>
        <p>The current plan is to fill the tract with a 130,000-square-foot, three-building office and retail complex, plus a garage for up to  320 cars. The state and county have agreed to lease much of the 80,000 square feet of office space in one of the buildings.</p>
        <p>The other project will be the reuse of the 90,000-square-foot, five-story former Tepper's department store on West Front Street at the corner of Somerset Street, which has stood vacant since 1976. The proposal calls for transforming the building's upper floors into 80 apartments for the elderly, and its lower floors to 20,000 square feet of stores as well as 17,000 square feet of community space to be dedicated to the city.</p>
        <p>Mayor McWilliams said he was confident this time around that the redevelopment projects would be realized. The difference, he said, is that ''we have the support of the City Council and have dedicated an appropriate amount of staff resources to get the job done.''</p>
        <p>Discussions between the city and New Century Homes began in 1998. Mr. Goldberger, a partner in New Century, said while the city focused on redeveloping its retail base ''this plan focuses on bringing in middle-class families who will become shoppers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fefferman added that the partners were drawn to Plainfield because ''there was support from local officials and property values in the city were increasing.''</p>
        <p>Carl A. Reed, the owner of ERA Reed Real Estate Inc., a residential brokerage company in Plainfield, said the average sales price of comparable homes in the city ranged from $105,000 to $115,000. That represents a 10 to 15 percent rise over the last two years, said Mr. Reed, who is the project's leasing agent.</p>
        <p>To make the numbers work, the city and New Century Homes hammered out a redevelopment agreement over the last two years. Under the agreement, which was signed in January, the city declared each of the 69 lots an area in need of redevelopment, allowing Plainfield to sell the lots to a private developer rather than selling them at auction. The parties then agreed to a sales price for the lots, which equals 5 percent of the sales price of the homes, to be paid to the city in two installments.</p>
        <p>Home loans will be 30-year fixed market-rate mortgages with down payments as low as 3 percent, Mr. Goldberger said. There will also be loans with no down payment requirements, he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reed, the broker, said the monthly cost of owning one of the two-family homes would be close to what people would pay in rent. For example, buyers of a $170,000 two-family home, using a 30-year mortgage at 8.5 percent with 3 percent down, will have a monthly cost of $1,950, including mortgage payment and taxes.</p>
        <p>That is expected to be offset by the rent from the three-bedroom second-floor rental apartment, he said, adding that three-bedroom rentals in the city cost $1,000 to $1,100 a month. The monthly cost of owning one of the single-family homes comes to $1,350, he said.</p>
        <p>There will be three models for each of the one-  and two-family houses, which are being built by Simplex Industries of Scranton. All of the homes, which are expected to be built and sold over the next year, will have a personal computer, Mr. Goldberger said.</p>
