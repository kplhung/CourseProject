        <p>IF the death of celebrated artists is often followed by diminished interest in their work, Samuel Beckett has been luckier than most. He did not have to wait a generation for a admirer to find him a new public. In Michael Colgan, the artistic director of Dublin's Gate Theater, he had a ready apostle. Indeed, a Beckett revival was already in the works even before the Irish-born playwright died at 83 in Paris in 1989.</p>
        <p>''Beckett had been unjustifiably neglected, which perhaps explains my missionary zeal,'' said Mr. Colgan, who can boast of having known Beckett in his final years. ''He was the greatest playwright of the 20th century, he won the Nobel literature prize in 1969, he was very famous, yet his work has been one of the least known.''</p>
        <p>Well, perhaps a decade ago.</p>
        <p>In 1991, the Gate Theater presented Beckett's 19 stage plays along with a handful of his radio plays in a Beckett festival in Dublin. In 1996, Mr. Colgan took much the same package to the Lincoln Center Festival in New York. Five of the plays were presented in a mini-festival in Melbourne, Australia, in 1997. And last year, with the addition of more extensive poetry and prose readings, all 19 plays traveled to the Barbican Center in London. Everywhere, they were enthusiastically received.</p>
        <p>Thus encouraged, Mr. Colgan has decided to take his proselytizing a step further by carrying Beckett from stage to screen. Because this means more than simply filming theater productions, he has turned to renowned directors with movie experience like David Mamet. And because his aim is to reach a wider audience, he has been eager to use popular actors with proven appeal to moviegoers and television viewers, like Julianne Moore and Jeremy Irons. More fundamentally, he is convinced that the  public is now ready for Beckett.</p>
        <p>This was certainly not always the case. From the moment ''Waiting for Godot'' marked Beckett's switch from poetry and fiction to playwriting in 1953, his sparse language, absurd situations and minimalist staging exercised enormous influence on Western theater. Yet while he quickly built up a following, there was anything but agreement on the meaning of his plays. Traditional theatergoers often found them puzzling, sometimes depressing. Even with friendly critics, Beckett once lamented, ''It's all misunderstanding.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Colgan believes that the passage of time has made Beckett seem less intimidating.</p>
        <p>''It's the same plays but different audiences,'' said the intense, chain-smoking theater manager. ''In the 1960's, people would come out of the theater asking who Godot was. Today, no one cares who Godot was. In the 1960's, Beckett was treated reverentially. Today, people are overcoming the idea that he is bleak and inaccessible. What we now see more is the humor in his plays.''</p>
        <p>The Beckett Film Project, still a work in progress in studios in Dublin and London, is well advanced, with 10 plays already filmed. While half a dozen directors and actors have yet to sign on (Bernardo Bertolucci, for example, has been invited to direct ''Come and Go''), all 19 film versions should be ready by the end of the year. One of the first, ''Not I,'' directed by Neil Jordan, was screened at last month's film festival in Cannes, with Ms. Moore performing the 13-minute ''speaking mouth'' (except for an added opening shot, only the character's mouth is seen, rattling off a stream of consciousness).</p>
        <p>Other completed films include ''Catastrophe,'' in which Mr. Mamet directs Harold Pinter, Rebecca Pidgeon and, most luckily, John Gielgud in his last performance before his death at 96 on May 21; ''Play,'' with Anthony Minghella directing Kristin Scott Thomas, Juliet Stevenson and Alan Rickman; ''Endgame,'' with Conor McPherson directing Sir Michael Gambon and David Thewlis; ''Krapp's Last Tape,'' in which John Hurt is directed by Atom Egoyan; and ''Breath,'' a 45-second play without characters (beyond strewn garbage), directed by Damien Hirst, the young British artist best known for exhibiting dissected sharks and cows preserved in formaldehyde.</p>
        <p>To match his own theater experience, Mr. Colgan sought out an Irish movie producer, Alan Moloney, as his partner in the project. Their company, Blue Angel, in association with Tyrone Productions, a subsidiary of Riverdance, is producing the project along with RTE, the Irish radio and television network, and Britain's Channel 4. Indeed, while the films are being made for showings in movie houses, they will be seen first on television: in Ireland later this year and in Britain sometime next year. In New York, WNET (Channel 13) will present the plays next season when it inaugurates its new PBS drama series ''Stage on Screen'' on a date to be announced. There are also plans to show them on the large screen -- individually or in groups, since they are of drastically different lengths -- at film and theater festivals, and eventually to release them as videos. The cost of the project has been kept to about $6 million because the directors and actors have accepted nominal fees. Some even begged for a chance to participate.</p>
        <p>I  READ about a season of Beckett on film and I thought I'd feel very bad if I didn't do one,'' recalled Mr. Minghella, a former playwright turned movie director, most recently of ''The Talented Mr. Ripley.''  ''My unfinished doctoral thesis was on Beckett. 'Play' was the first play I ever directed, in a double bill with 'Happy Days.' There was a time when I read Beckett almost on a daily basis. The sense of language and poetry in his writing has been the single biggest influence on me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Egoyan, whose most recent movie is ''Felicia's Journey,'' was invited to direct ''Krapp's Last Tape'' in place of John Boorman, who directed ''Deliverance'' and ''The General'' and had a conflicting film engagement. Yet Mr. Egoyan's involvement was hardly accidental. He, too, is a Beckett devotee.</p>
        <p>''This play had a huge effect on me when I started as a writer because it is one of the most impressive examples of creation and technology,'' Mr. Egoyan said of the play in which a 69-year-old man listens to reflections on life that he tape-recorded on his birthday 30 years earlier. ''It had a haunting effect on me. I needed to do this play. When John Boorman pulled out, I dropped everything to do it.''</p>
        <p>Still, even before directors and actors were chosen, Mr. Colgan had a major obstacle to overcome. More than most playwrights, Beckett included in his texts highly detailed instructions on how they should be staged, directed and performed (two of them, ''Act Without Words I'' and ''Act Without Words II,'' involve only directions to the performers). In fact, during Beckett's lifetime, he directed the first production of almost every new play. And since his death, the Beckett estate, managed by his nephew and executor, Edward Beckett, has done its best to ensure that his wishes are respected (objecting, in one well-known case, to Deborah Warner's innovative staging of ''Footfalls,'' with Fiona Shaw, in 1994; 10 years earlier, of course, Beckett himself had famously complained about the experimental American director JoAnne Akalaitis's set and music in a staging of ''Endgame'' at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass.).</p>
        <p>Thanks to the success of his Beckett festivals, however, Mr. Colgan was able to persuade the Beckett estate to go along with the film project -- with conditions.</p>
        <p>''We worked out a bible to give the directors,'' Mr. Colgan recalled. ''No cuts, no gender-bending, and if Beckett says 'beach,' there should be a beach. We didn't want adaptations or 'inspired by' stuff. We needed directors with a sense of the importance of the text. That's why we sought out writer-directors. We let them choose their own casts, but this project is not actor-led, it is director-led.''</p>
        <p>By ceding the right to pick the casts, the producers were also hoping that the directors would bring aboard well-known actors with whom they had worked in movies. And in several cases this worked. Ms. Moore, for instance, had starred in Mr. Jordan's most recent film, ''The End of the Affair.'' Similarly, Mr. Rickman and Ms. Stevenson appeared in Mr. Minghella's first feature film, ''Truly, Madly, Deeply,'' while Ms. Scott Thomas had a lead role in his Oscar-winning movie, ''The English Patient.'' By contrast, Mr. Irons had not worked in movies with Tom Stoppard, who was originally to direct him as both Reader and Listener in ''Ohio Impromptu.'' But when Mr. Stoppard dropped out because of other commitments, he was replaced by Charles Sturridge, who had directed Mr. Irons in the acclaimed television adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's ''Brideshead Revisited.''</p>
        <p>Posing a greater challenge to directors than casting, though, is how to translate Beckett to the screen without changing a single word of text. Camera movements, editing cuts and above all close-ups naturally create a different visual narrative from that seen in a theater. But because film is a more literal medium than theater, where a single light on a darkened stage is enough to create a mood, some directors elaborated on Beckett's proposed staging.</p>
        <p>It helped that several of them are as familiar with theater as they are with movies. Mr. McPherson, whose play ''The Weir'' ran for eight months on Broadway last year, wrote the screenplay for Paddy Breathnach's ''I Went Down'' and recently directed his first film, ''Saltwater,'' itself a loose adaptation of his play ''This Lime Tree Bower.''</p>
        <p>''I felt that 'Endgame' was one of the plays that would best translate into film because there's a definite location, a room,'' Mr. McPherson said. ''Beckett only said 'interior.' I asked Edward Beckett if it could be an attic and he said yes. So it meant I could put in a staircase. In an attic at the top of the house, you could also have sounds to create an atmosphere. It's by the sea, so you could have the sound of the bell on a buoy.''</p>
        <p>For ''Krapp's Last Tape,'' Beckett called only for a table, a chair, a tape-recorder, a microphone and a box of old tapes. And this is how Mr. Hurt performed the play at the Barbican and subsequently during a seven-week run on the West End. But at Ardmore Studios outside Dublin, though scruffy and unshaven as ever, Mr. Hurt was now doing his muttering and shuffling in a cramped private library, packed with old books, yellowing files and dusty papers.</p>
        <p>''The most radical thing we have done is to make the setting completely natural,'' Mr. Egoyan explained during a lunch break. ''There's nothing theatrical to it. The play becomes more devastating if you locate it in a real place.''</p>
        <p>In ''Play,'' Beckett has two women and a man up to their necks in urns, with only the speaker's face lighted against a darkened stage: the lights flash from one to the other as each pours out a stream of bitter, disjointed memories of love and betrayal. For the film version, shot at Pinewood Studios near London, Mr. Minghella replaced the light with the camera, so that only the speaker's face is on screen. Still more radically, in order to show -- rather than suggest -- purgatory, he added a score of other urns, peopled by extras, against a stormy backdrop of fields and hills, dominated by a single gnarled tree.</p>
        <p>A LL of Beckett's plays are within each other,'' Mr. Minghella said. ''This is a cousin of 'Not I,' and I make a few visual nods to it by isolating the mouth. Also, that blasted landscape from 'Waiting for Godot' is partly here. If you have to have a tree in this landscape, it has to be that tree. I had the idea of the whole of Ireland as a cemetery. It's a very Irish story, a mixture of Dante and Dublin.''</p>
        <p>So was Beckett an Irish playwright? He spent almost his entire adult life in Paris; there was a distinct Left Bank existentialism to much of his work; he wrote many of his plays first in French, and he did not visit Ireland in the last 21 years of his life. His best-known plays -- ''Waiting for Godot,''  ''Endgame'' and ''Happy Days'' -- are still regularly performed in France, but the Beckett festivals and now the Beckett Film Project are evident attempts to reclaim him as an English-language writer, and an Irish one at that.</p>
        <p>''I made sure everyone had an Irish accent,'' Mr. McPherson said. ''The English that Beckett wrote is full of Irishisms, full of Irish inflections. Michael Gambon was born in Dublin, so that was easy. David Thewlis is from Blackpool, but he picked up a South Dublin accent very quickly.''</p>
        <p>In several films where the movie directors are not Irish, a sense of place is provided by well-known Irish actors: Sean Foley in ''Act Without Words I,'' directed by Karel Reisz, whose film credits include ''The French Lieutenant's Woman'' and ''Isadora''; Rosaleen Linehan in ''Happy Days,'' directed by Patricia Rozema, who recently adapted Jane Austen's ''Mansfield Park'' for the screen; Sean McGinley and Gary Lewis in ''What Where,'' directed by Damien O'Donnell, whose most recent movie is ''East Is East''; and Susan Fitzgerald and Jane O'Hara in ''Footfalls'' and Johnny Murphy and Barry McGovern in ''Waiting for Godot,'' both directed by Walter Asmus. Mr. Asmus, a German, is the only filmmaker in the project to have worked alongside Beckett; his production of ''Waiting for Godot'' was included in Mr. Colgan's Beckett theater festivals.</p>
        <p>Yet even where no Irish accent is heard, as in ''Not I,''  ''Krapp's Last Tape,''  ''Catastrophe'' and ''Play,'' Mr. Colgan, for one, can hear the Irish in Beckett's writing.</p>
        <p>''When he translated from French into English, he didn't translate, he wrote a new play,'' Mr. Colgan said. ''And then there's the humor. It's very Irish.''</p>
        <p>Certainly, while the humor of, say, ''Not I'' or ''Play'' or ''Catastrophe'' is not immediately apparent, there is no shortage of it in ''Waiting for Godot,'' which Beckett described as a tragicomedy (the only time that he actually defined one of his plays), and in ''Endgame.''</p>
        <p>'' 'Endgame' is absolutely bonkers,'' Mr. McPherson said of the play in which Hamm, a man condemned to existence in a chair, has Clov, perhaps his adopted son, as his servant and his aged parents, Nagg and Nell, living in garbage cans. ''It shows that Beckett had a sense of humor and liked to entertain the public. Hopefully, this will demystify Beckett's reputation for being hard going. I just wanted to make sure it was funny because, if it was funny, it could be understood. It's a comedy, a bittersweet comedy.''</p>
        <p>Performing Beckett on stage or on screen, though, is no joke. ''Beckett is a punisher of actors,'' Mr. Jordan said. ''He always confines them in the most ridiculous places -- in urns, in garbage cans, up to their necks in sand. It's like he has an extreme resistance to the basic reality of theater, which is the actor.''</p>
        <p>In ''Endgame,'' the actors who are in the garbage cans, Charles Simon and Jean Anderson, are both in their 90's, which required Mr. McPherson to shoot their scenes quickly to minimize their discomfort. In the movie version of ''Play,'' not only are the actors inside urns, but their faces are also covered in a slimy green makeup and large crumbling scabs, ''as to seem almost part of urns,'' as Beckett instructed.</p>
        <p>''I just came from looking glamorous for 10 days in Cannes,'' Ms. Scott Thomas said with a laugh as she climbed out of her urn one recent afternoon. ''Now look at me.'' Indeed, from one day to the next, she had gone from being a jury member at the film festival to resembling something out of a horror movie.</p>
        <p>The single heaviest demand on the actors, though, was that they should be word perfect, with not a single variance from Beckett's text.</p>
        <p>''With my own scripts, I'm happy to allow an actor to improvise,'' Mr. McPherson said. ''Here, accuracy was the letter of the law. I'd think I had a wonderful take, then the script person would say one word was in the wrong order. Oh, no!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jordan said that ''Not I'' took on meaning only when it was delivered continuously, so he filmed five successive takes of Ms. Moore's performance one afternoon at Shepperton Studios near London. And she stumbled only once, he said with admiration.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Minghella was filming ''Play'' late last month, his approach was to do repeated takes of scenes, or rather lines. He did so, he said, because he plans to ''cut, cut, cut'' during editing, but also because he wanted to push -- ''persecute'' was his word -- the actors toward an almost zombielike minimalism. Hovering beside Ms. Scott Thomas, for example, he kept asking for take after take with such comments as ''too much acting'' or ''faster, drier'' or ''too much emotion.''</p>
        <p>YET for all the difficulties involved, actors and directors seemed thrilled to be spreading the word of Beckett. Mr. Hurt, who before London had not acted in a Beckett play, said he was fascinated by how the playwright ''constantly finds a way of putting his finger on things that are universal.'' Mr. Jordan, who once directed ''Waiting for Godot'' as a 20-year-old, said Beckett had been ''maddeningly influential'' over the language of film as well as theater. Mr. Minghella said he was happy to have done something for its own sake without worrying about ''money, marketing, cassettes going out to Academy members.''</p>
        <p>That said, the film project remains a thoroughly original venture, one that will inevitably influence how Beckett's plays are perceived. And even if its audiences are limited, it contains the jewel of Sir John Gielgud's last recorded performance in ''Catastrophe,'' in the nonspeaking role of Protagonist, as he is being prepared to go onstage by a theater director and his assistant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mamet and Mr. Pinter excluded outsiders from the set at Shepperton, but Mr. Colgan was there on April 14, the second day of shooting, which happened to be Sir John's birthday.</p>
        <p>''He was very frail on the set, but mentally he was very alive,'' Mr. Colgan remembered. ''I spent 45 minutes with him in his dressing room and we had a good chat. I asked him how he felt to be working on his 96th birthday. His reply was pure Gielgud. 'Well,' he said softly, 'it's a great surprise.' ''</p>
