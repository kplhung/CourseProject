        <p>The leader board looked as crowded as the subway during rush hour.</p>
        <p>Eleven players will begin Sunday's final round of the Buick Classic within three strokes of the leader, Duffy Waldorf. Rarely has a one-stroke lead looked so minuscule, particularly given the caliber of players chasing Waldorf, the defending champion.</p>
        <p>While Waldorf was alone at seven under par (206), look at the names in pursuit. Seven players were one stroke off the lead -- David Duval, Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els, Chris Perry, John Cook, Skip Kendall and Joey Sindelar. Jim Carter, Steve Lowery and Dennis Paulson were two strokes off the lead at five under par, while Sergio Garcia was alone at four under par, three strokes behind Waldorf.</p>
        <p>Fans and tournament officials love that kind of star-studded leader board. And for the players, Sunday's finale at the challenging Westchester Country Club course will serve as near-perfect preparation for the United States Open, which begins Thursday in Pebble Beach, Calif. Even the players were eager to see how the round would unfold.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of a one-day tournament, and there's probably 20 guys that have a really good chance,'' said Mickelson, who will try to join Tiger Woods as the PGA Tour's only four-time winners this year. ''It's anybody's tournament, but I don't think it's going to take an exceptional round. With the golf course playing as difficult as it is, you really only need to shoot a few under par. If anybody gets to 10 under, I think that will win for sure. Eight or nine under has an outside shot for a playoff.''</p>
        <p>The logjam at the top was fueled by today's trying conditions, which allowed only 18 of 71 players to break par. It was the windiest day of the tournament, and with 92-degree temperatures hardening the greens and complementing the four-inch deep rough, it felt like the grueling conditions at the United States Open.</p>
        <p>Garcia, Spain's 20-year-old sensation, had the day's best round, a six-under-par 65 that stood out like a neon sign. But for most, the day was about survival -- avoiding the potential double-bogeys that could send someone tumbling down the scoreboard like an elevator headed toward the basement.</p>
        <p>Paulson began the third round with a two-stroke lead over Kendall. But Paulson struggled to a 75, including a bogey at No. 10, a bogey at No. 14 and a costly double-bogey at No. 15. Paulson's woes knocked him out of first place and helped a huge pack of players into contention. Waldorf, who shot a 68, took sole possession of the lead after Paulson made his three-putt bogey at No. 14. Considering how many players were chasing him, however, Waldorf was not ordering Champagne yet.</p>
        <p>''I can't really play like I'm in the lead,'' said Waldorf, who could become only the second Buick Classic back-to-back winner, joining Els, who won in 1996 and 1997. ''There are so many guys that are close to me, great players. With that many guys close, you can't really feel like you've got to protect the lead, or like you're in the lead at all.''</p>
        <p>Mickelson had the day's most spectacular shot, an eagle at the par-4 No. 17, when he holed a wedge shot from 88 yards. After the ball landed about two feet from the cup and tumbled into the hole, Mickelson took off his cap and smiled, knowing it was a turning point. He had just made a dreadful double-bogey at the par-3 No. 16, putting his tee shot well right of the green and putting himself in near-impossible position from which to save par. That double-bogey dropped Mickelson to four under par, but the eagle moved him back to six under and in the thick of contention.</p>
        <p>So many contenders will have different reasons for motivation Sunday. Els, who shot a 68 today, has not won since February 1999, and he admitted he was eager to change that.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I'm playing well enough to win, and on this course, I know how to win,'' Els said. ''A win would be great for me right now. Look at the way Phil played today; makes double-bogey on 16, then he knocks it in on 17. That's what confidence does.''</p>
        <p>Els will not be the only driven player, however. Duval has not won since April 1999. Sindelar has not won since 1990. Lowery has not won since 1994. Cook has made the cut in only 5 of 15 events this year. Perry, Kendall and Paulson have never won on tour, while Garcia has never won in the United States.</p>
        <p>Duval, the world's No. 2-ranked player, has insisted since early in the week that he felt ready to win, not just Sunday, but next week.</p>
        <p>''Those are my plans,'' said Duval, who shot a 70 today. ''I feel like I'm swinging the club better, and I feel like I'm putting like I putt.''</p>
        <p>But with so many players having a legitimate chance, the final round holds a multitude of possibilities.</p>
        <p>''I think it's always exciting when you enter an event, and to win, you have to beat the highest-ranked players in the field,'' Duval said. ''That's kind of what you strive for, those kind of shootouts and those kind of battles.''</p>
