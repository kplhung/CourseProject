        <p>Like most people who have a lawn, George Fabiano got tired of taking care of his. The mowing. The brown spots. The watering. The grubs. The chemicals. The money.</p>
        <p>Finally, about three weeks ago, Mr. Fabiano decided that enough was enough. So about the same time the artificial surface was removed from Giants Stadium and replaced with sod, workmen came to Mer. Fabiano's s house in this Bergen County town, mowed the grass on the 1,379 square-foot front yard down to the roots, laid down a bed of gravel and covered it with 100-by-12-foot rolls of polyethelene fiber.</p>
        <p>After the grass sheets were rolled out, they were glued and sewn. Sand was poured over the synthetic grass  -- four pounds per square foot -- to stabilize the mat and keep the blades erect.</p>
        <p>''Don't have to cut the grass and it looks good,'' he said with a smile, even though the bright green carpet  sloped to the sidewalk and shone a touch more brightly and evenly than the grass of the neighbors.</p>
        <p>This wasn't exactly Mr. T taking a chainsaw to the maples on the grounds of his suburban estate. Still, the reaction to Mr. Fabiano's plastic grass has been subdued.</p>
        <p>One woman who asked not to be identified said she didn't like it because it didn't look real. But another neighbor, Ronica Barry, who lives across the street, laughed when asked about it.</p>
        <p>''I haven't heard anybody that's really against it,'' said Ms. Barry. ''It looks good from a distance but it feels terrible to the touch.''</p>
        <p>Somebody not knowing could ride by and say that it is a perfect lawn, she said ''But, she added, ''it's got a shine to it. The sun reflects off of it, so you can tell it's not real.''</p>
        <p>But Patrick McLaren, president and chief executive of the Perma Grass Corp. in Hasbrouck Heights, which did the work at the Fabiano house, is not deterred.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. McLaren envisions a world covered by the stuff.</p>
        <p>''I defy you to say it's not really grass,'' he said. And, he added, ''I think the future is synthetic grass.</p>
        <p>Mr. McLaren, who worked for a  company that made running tracks out of recycled tires, left to start Perma Grass about two years ago  ''This is my brainstorm, absolutely,'' he said. And when I formed this they called it 'McLaren's Folly.' 'Come on,' they said, 'I love the smell of fresh grass.' Oh you do? Good! No more watering. No more cutting. No weeds. No chemicals.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McLaren said the company has done about 50 day care centers in North Jersey (with a tighter weave grass made of polypropylene laid over a rubber pad) and an all-purpose soccer field in East Newark, a playgound at the Paramus Pool, and a triangle in Lodi.</p>
        <p>About three months ago, it began its campaign to carpet front and back yards through flyers placed in a daily newspaper. So far, Mr. McLaren said, Perma Grass has done 6 homes, including his own in Lodi, and has 6 more under contract.</p>
        <p>''One of the major problems we're getting calls for -- the geese problem,'' he said. ''They will not come near the perma grass. That's another use for it.''</p>
        <p>Dogs, on the other hand, are not repelled. So what happens when a dog decides to appreciate the perma grass? ''Absolutely nothing,'' Mr. McLaren said. ''It will wash right off.''</p>
        <p>As for somebody dropping a cigarette on it, Joseph Caravella, vice  president of the company who oversees construction, said, ''It's not flammable; it will melt a little section. It's a matter of five minutes to repair it.''</p>
        <p>Samuel Serritella, president of In-Sports International, Inc. the parent company, said that the product is ''environmentally friendly.'' ''There are no carcinogens in it.''</p>
        <p>The materials in perma grass, polypropylene and polyethelene, are ''pretty durable,'' said Roger Jones, chairman of the chemistry department at Rutgers. ''They make kitchen cutting boards out them,'' Mr. Jones said.</p>
        <p>James Murphy, associate specialist in turf grass management at Rutgers Cooperative Extension at Cook College, said he did not think laying artificial grass hurt the soil.</p>
        <p>Still, Dr. Murphy said, ''It would tend to build up heat. It wouldn't be a major problem until hot summer days. It would make soil conditions hot and that would migrate to plant beds and put stress on them.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. McLaren said he  sees a profitable future. He even expects to expand into cemetery plots. ''We haven't even scratched the surface,'' he said.</p>
