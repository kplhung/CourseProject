        <p>TRAFFIC will come to a halt for a mile along on Fifth Avenue Tuesday evening as nine museums take to the streets for the 22nd annual Museum Mile Festival (part of last year's is shown above). The action will take place from 82nd to 104th Street. For the first time, several of the museums will offer outdoor art activities, including chalk art and seven-foot pieces of chalk for families to play with. Twentieth-century New York will be celebrated in an event called Mapping Memories, and outside the National Academy of Design, children 9 to 12 will be shown how to sketch a live model. Musicians will perform in front of the museums.</p>
