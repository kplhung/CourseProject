        <p>HEAD northeast in Newfoundland along the Bonavista Peninsula until the rough road ends and the cold ocean begins, and you'll find a bronze statue of a man clothed in pouffy Renaissance garb overlooking tumultuous seas.

        <p>HEAD northeast in Newfoundland along the Bonavista Peninsula until the rough road ends and the cold ocean begins, and you'll find a bronze statue of a man clothed in pouffy Renaissance garb overlooking tumultuous seas. The landscape has a distinctly edge-of-the-known-world feel to it: icebergs float offshore like errant mountaintops, humpback whales feed and breach, and puffins dart along the ocean surface to and from their island colony just around the point.</p>
        <p>That improbably dapper man is John Cabot, who in 1497 reached the New World -- the New Founde Land, as it was dubbed. Like Columbus five years before him, Cabot was an Italian sailor seeking a shortcut to the Orient. He figured that by heading north to where the longitudinal lines were closer, he'd shave off some sailing days on his westward voyage to Asia.</p>
        <p>He figured wrong, of course. Cabot and his crew of 18 ran into the immutable coast of eastern Canada, and instead of spices and porcelain they found spruce trees and floating ice. Undaunted, Cabot claimed the region for the English throne, which had financed his expedition, then headed home.</p>
        <p>So enduring are the tales of Cabot's arrival hereabouts -- the peninsula's name comes from the first words he was said to have uttered -- that it seems unsporting to mention that Cabot's landing spot is wholly a matter of conjecture. Historians say Cabot may very well have made landfall hereabouts, or perhaps in Nova Scotia on Cape Breton Island, where a similar statue also marks the event. Then again, maybe Cabot landed up in Labrador (now part of the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador), or much farther south in Maine. No one  knows for sure.</p>
        <p>Where Cabot came ashore may be in dispute, but what he found is not: cod and lots of them. Historic accounts say that Cabot lowered a basket weighted with stones into the north Atlantic, then hauled it back up brimming with cod. The discovery of these fertile fishing grounds set off a centuries-long struggle among Basque, Portuguese, French and English fishermen, and established a pattern of far-flung coastal settlements, called outports by Newfoundlanders, that ring the island.</p>
        <p>During a three-day trip on the peninsula last August, my friend Louise and I came to believe that cod was directly linked to every historic event and every building in every village we visited. We also learned that the Bonavista Peninsula, which is about two hours from the capital of St. John's, captures a large slice of Newfoundland in a compact package. Here we found the wild, boreal seascapes for which the island is justly noted, as well as historic villages where we could start to unravel the various strands of Newfoundland's colorful history.</p>
        <p>We began our explorations at Ryan's Premises National Historic Site in the fishing village of Bonavista. The frequent references to ''premises'' in Newfoundland have to do with the once-mighty local merchants who sold local fishermen everything they needed, then bought and exported all the cod they caught.</p>
        <p>Ryan's Premises was founded in 1871 by James Ryan, the son of an Irish immigrant who in early photographs looks like a Thomas Nast cartoon, corpulent and exuding that peculiar brand of self-satisfaction found chiefly in mercantile kings. Ryan's business thrived, and over time it expanded to include a prominent compound of impressively austere white clapboard buildings edging the harbor. Various Ryans ran the business  until 1978, when the place finally closed its doors. A museum guide suggested that Ryan's was the equivalent of a Wal-Mart.</p>
        <p>Ryan's Premises reopened in 1997 as a national historic site, and Parks Canada has  taken what could be a painfully dull subject (cod fisheries) and rendered it fascinating. We spent hours wandering through the several buildings, which are filled with evocative displays about local fishing and seal hunting -- from Cabot's putative arrival  through the event that shaped the island's present-day economy: the commercial extinction of cod and the islandwide ban on cod fishing in 1992.</p>
        <p>Afterward, we detoured to the other side of the harbor and past a replica of the Matthew -- the ship Cabot sailed to North America -- which was being outfitted as a floating museum. (It will be open for tours this summer.) We drove several miles past rocky oceanside meadows populated with cows and sheep to the peninsula's tip, where we admired Cabot's statue and toured a handsome red-and-white lighthouse, built in 1843 and restored inside and out to look as it did around 1870.</p>
        <p>The rocky, wind-swept location, next to an industrious puffin colony, is dramatic enough to provoke extended maritime reveries. But our tour guide in the lighthouse nipped any romance-of-the-seas nostalgia.  The 200-pound counterweights at Bonavista that propelled the rotating reflectors took 15 minutes to rewind -- a job performed every two hours throughout the dark nights.</p>
        <p>Bonavista is gradually seeking more tourism to offset the collapse of the fishing industry -- two cruise ships even stopped  here last summer -- but dining and accommodation options are still quite limited.</p>
        <p>That's not the case in Trinity, a tidy village of 400 residents about 30 miles away on the south shore of the peninsula. Trinity is hitting full stride as a destination for history buffs -- the streets were teeming with pedestrians and we couldn't find a room for the night when we arrived without reservations last August, despite the proliferation of inns and B &amp; B's in the town.</p>
        <p>There's a reason Trinity is so popular: it's one of the best preserved villages in Atlantic Canada, and wonderfully evocative of an early and prosperous outport community.</p>
        <p>Trinity was first settled in the mid-16th century by a handful of determined immigrants from England's West Country. The British backers of the extensive fishing fleets discouraged permanent settlements in Newfoundland (they wanted all the money to return home), so it wasn't until the 18th century that Trinity emerged as a mercantile center, home to extensive fishing, seal hunting and cargo fleets.</p>
        <p>The village occupies the toe of a hilly peninsula within a well-protected harbor, with three inlets offering plenty of shoreline for docks and warehouses. Among those who took notice of the fine location was Benjamin Lester, a hard-driving Englishman from Poole, who by the 1780's had become the Bill Gates of Newfoundland. He oversaw a trading empire that stretched well up the Labrador coast, and in Trinity he had a number of wharves and warehouses, a factory producing cod-liver oil, and a payroll of 200, including blacksmiths, boat builders and storekeepers. His heirs, the Garlands, maintained the premises before selling out in the 1830's; it was finally shuttering in 1953.</p>
        <p>Little is left of Lester's empire:the piers and harborside buildings are collapsed and gone, and his home succumbed to time. But the decay of the Lester-Garland Premises did lead to the formation in 1961 of the Trinity Historical Society, which has preserved much of the rest of the village and restored the Lester-Garland House.</p>
        <p>As a result, Trinity is filled with tidy homes of white clapboard and wood shingles, with handsome old churches tucked on small lots along narrow lanes, many edged with picket fences. The village has a dollhouse scale to it, and is reminiscent of both England and New England. Yet it remains distinctly Newfoundland, with its squarish, no-nonsense white homes trimmed with tropical colors.</p>
        <p>For several hours we wandered the town, visiting cemeteries and some of the 17 significant buildings that have been preserved or rebuilt. Among these are the Green Family Forge, which has been in operation since 1795, and the recent reconstruction of the Lester-Garland House, an impressive brick Georgian structure grafted onto surviving end walls and the stone foundation of the original home. We admired a 255-seat theater being built along the harbor (expected to open this summer), designed to resemble one of Lester's early warehouses.</p>
        <p>Trinity at times feels like a theater set, which is fitting. Three times each week the Rising Tide Theater Company stages a roving production in which historic episodes are acted out in nine places around town, with the peripatetic audience tagging along. We missed the pageant, but did attend one of the evening productions that followed the life of an outport family through two of the island's watershed events: the resettlement of the residents of the smallest outports to larger towns following the collapse of the salt-cod market after World War II, and the island's decision to forgo its status as a British colony and join Canada in 1949.</p>
        <p>In the morning, we joined a small group in a two-hour walking tour of Trinity led by Kevin Toope, who moved to Trinity as a young child from a resettled outport, Ireland's Eye. We first trekked up a grassy hill overlooking the harbor, where Mr. Toope used vintage photographs to describe Trinity in its heyday -- when ferries linked villages across the harbor, and sperm whales were hauled ashore to have blubber skin cut off. As we walked from cemetery to church to open bluff, Mr. Toope played  readings on his tape recorder: excerpts from court records of bawdy 18th-century Trinity, an inventory of shipwrecks with the number of lives lost.</p>
        <p>We had planned to spend the afternoon in Port Union visiting the residence of Sir William Coaker, a noted union organizer and an outsized character in Newfoundland's history. But when Mr. Toope mentioned another resettled outport nearby, we felt we had a chance to see a bit of history that would soon be lost. We bought a picnic lunch of crackers, cheese and fruit, then drove across a winding ridge-top road toward the town of New Bonaventure, about six miles away.</p>
        <p>We parked next to a towering Anglican church on a hilltop, then walked 45 minutes along a grassy lane through berry-filled hills, past pristine upland ponds, and along coastal bluffs with sweeping views of Trinity Bay. The whole landscape was imbued with a fairy tale enchantment, an impression that wasn't altered when we arrived at the abandoned outport, Kerley's Harbor, to find a small whale swimming about, its spout echoing off the hills that closely wrapped the harbor.</p>
        <p>The village of Kerley's Harbor had a population of 90 in 1935, but was abandoned in 1963. The homes had already fallen in on themselves, leaving piles of bleached wood capped with the occasional gable. In the meadows surrounding the cove we turned up iron bedsteads and fragments of wood stoves. We explored root cellars and the ruins of docks, speculating about life here in the active days.</p>
        <p>Earlier that week Newfoundland had opened the inshore cod fishery for personal consumption on a trial basis, and on our drive back to Trinity we noticed cod drying in front of many homes on wooden racks. The sour-sweet aroma wafted across the road, suggesting that the final chapter in the island's long history with cod hasn't yet been written.</p>
