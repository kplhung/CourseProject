        <p>Keith Jarrett letter disputes Ben Ratliff's May 28 article on use of word 'just' to describe jazz literature and solos by Wynton Marsalis (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In Ben Ratliff's article ''The Solo Retreats From the Spotlight in Jazz'' [May 28], it's interesting to contemplate the implications of the word ''just,'' both in his ''a jazz literature for the future, rather than just a few exploding minutes of genius in a B-flat blues'' and in Wynton Marsalis's '' 'as opposed to just soloing, which is really a boring and predictable way of presenting music.' ''</p>
        <p>May I ask whose soloing Mr. Marsalis is referring to? And may I ask Mr. Ratliff what he thinks jazz actually is, if not those few precious exploding moments? And what does he think genius is? Those exploding moments can hold more sustenance than all the ''jazz literature'' (whatever that is) ever written. Look at Duke's band: how does his written music sound now, without those master soloists-improvisers? Dry, lifeless, institutional.</p>

        <p>It is personal narrative we're losing, personal awareness: players with something to say. If that thread is broken (and it may well be), we're not going to write our way into the jazz future without important improvisatory voices, because the narrative that is jazz will have died.</p>
        <p>The spirit of jazz is the spirit of personal freedom. There is no literature, no repertory of personal freedom, only spontaneous individual acts. Jazz needs these acts of freedom to reconfirm itself in every era. It is in the player's art, not the writer's. There is no future if there is no present.</p>
