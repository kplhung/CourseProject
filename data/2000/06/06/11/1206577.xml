        <p>ON Sundays, John B. Leo plays shortstop in a softball league in Geneva, Ill., outside Chicago. As a batter, he is no Mark McGwire, having hit just one home run last year. But he often gets on base -- a good analogy to his investing style as lead manager of the $2.51 billion Northern Technology fund.</p>
        <p>''Our focus is on consistent, above-average growth companies, like baseball players who hit steady singles and doubles,'' Mr. Leo said from his office in downtown Chicago. ''We're more than happy to stumble on a home run, like the next Microsoft, but those are few and far between.''</p>
        <p>His base hits have been consistent. Northern Technology returned 69.1 percent a year, annualized, for the three years through June 2, compared with 53.8 percent for its peers in the technology fund category, according to Morningstar Inc.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leo, 38, works with a co-manager, George J. Gilbert, and four technology analysts to pick the 60 to 85 stocks that the fund holds. The team members keep a close eye on the companies in their specific industry sectors. ''We're bottoms-up analysts,'' Mr. Leo said. ''We're always kicking the tires of the companies that have the growth characteristics that we're looking for.''</p>
        <p>The most basic of these is annual earnings and sales growth rates of at least 25 percent. Also key is the size of the company's market, and how that market is expected to grow over the next three to five years. ''In technology, unlike other industries, new market niches are developing all the time,'' Mr. Leo said.</p>
        <p>The team also reviews a company's competitive position in terms of potential market share -- the bigger the better. But each sector is evaluated differently. ''In some sectors, being first on the market with a new product or service is important,'' he said. ''Other sectors are growing so rapidly that you can own two or four companies in the same business because the tide is so strong that all of them can thrive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leo wants to see expansion in  gross profit margins, and even more important, in operating margins. Strength in that area, he said, often indicates that a company has operating efficiencies and price leverage.</p>
        <p>He figures that the team members spend about 20 percent of their time talking to management, who should include what he calls ''true technologists -- people who can see what the next generation of technology will require and how to get the company to that point.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the team reviews company documents and reports, as well as Wall Street research. They also talk to suppliers, customers and other intermediaries to gauge a company's competitive position.</p>
        <p>For most software companies and other fast-growing concerns, he looks at the price-to-sales multiple.  For most semiconductor companies, which operate in a fairly mature, cyclical market, he checks the price-to-earnings ratio.</p>
        <p>The key question in today's market, of course, is what constitutes excessive valuation. ''It's pretty hard to pick the top in technology stocks,'' Mr. Leo conceded. Still, he said, ''we're a little concerned that some valuations in some parts of the market are aggressive, unless companies are doubling their sales growth year over year.'' That kind of revenue growth is occurring among some communications-related semiconductor, optical networking and Internet-related software companies, he added. But in other areas, like e-tailing, valuations can be ahead of the growth.</p>
        <p>MR. LEO likes Veritas Software, which helps businesses manage their data storage. ''The explosion in Internet-driven and computer networking data has combined to create an extremely high growth rate for storage capacity needs,'' he said. The company's software is unusual, he added, because it ties together networks cobbled from different hardware providers. He forecasts Veritas's three-year earnings growth rate at 50 percent, annualized, and says it will dominate its market with sales of $10 billion five years hence, versus $596.1 million in 1999.</p>
        <p>He bought shares in November at $53. They now trade at $135.6875, or 46 times his sales-per-share estimate of $2.96 for 2000.</p>
        <p>Another pick is Applied Micro Circuits of San Diego, which makes semiconductors for the telecommunications and data networking industries. Its sales are being driven by businesses that are building high-speed Internet networks, Mr. Leo said, adding that the company is the market leader in providing telecommunications equipment companies with chips used in wide area networks. He expects the company's earnings to grow 45 percent, annualized, over the next three years, and  puts the size of its potential market at $100 billion in five years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leo first bought shares in November at $44 and added more last week as shares dipped on concerns over slowing sales growth to a large customer; they now trade at $105.75, or 54.5 times his estimate of $1.94 in sales per share for 2000.</p>
        <p>A longtime holding is JDS Uniphase of San Jose, Calif., a maker of fiber optic networking gear. The company has solidified a leadership position by making several strategic acquisitions over the last few years, Mr. Leo said. It is currently acquiring E-Tek Dynamics, a San Jose electrical components maker.</p>
        <p>He expects earnings growth of 45 percent, annualized, over the next three years and figures that JDS operates in a market of $25 billion to $30 billion in three years.</p>
        <p>He bought shares in February, 1998 for the equivalent of $5 each; they now trade at $110.5625, or 59 times his sales-per-share estimate of $1.87 for this year.</p>
