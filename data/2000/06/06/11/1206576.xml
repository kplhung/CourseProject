        <p>At a meeting of Democratic Assembly members in Albany last month, Assemblywoman Audrey I. Pheffer interrupted a discussion about a $100 million bailout for Nassau County to raise an old complaint. Nassau County residents can use city parks in Queens, she said, but Queens residents cannot use county parks.</p>
        <p>''If the state is going to help out Nassau County,'' Ms. Pheffer, who represents Far Rockaway, asked, ''is some of that money going to go into a parks system that is restricted?''</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Mark Weprin, who was also at the meeting, said that his constituents in the Queens communities of Bayside, Little Neck and Douglaston felt the same. ''It just galls many of us,'' he said. ''A lot of people in my area live closer to Nassau parks than they do to Queens parks, and they can't get in.''</p>
        <p>Many towns and villages within Nassau have their own parks, and their rules of admission vary. But there are 19 county parks in Nassau, and all are limited to county residents. Visitors from Queens or elsewhere can gain access to them, but only for a fee and only if they come as a guest of a county resident. In contrast, anyone can use city parks in Queens. For example, said Mr. Weprin, Nassau residents could have heard the New York City Philharmonic free at a concert in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Not so if Queens residents wanted to attend a similar concert at Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, Nassau County.</p>
        <p>John Kiernan, the commissioner of the Nassau County Department of Recreation and Parks, explained that access was limited to the county's parks because Nassau homeowners and business owners paid an earmarked property tax to maintain them. He said limited access was not unusual. Other counties do the same, he said, as do villages and townships.</p>
        <p>''We have taxes, too,'' responded the city's parks commissioner, Henry J. Stern. ''But parks are for people, not just for taxpayers.''</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli, the Nassau County Democratic leader, said it was wrong to tie the parks issue to the bailout. ''We're teetering on the verge of junk bond status,'' he said. ''It would not be good for Queens if we went under.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weprin said he did not think the parks flap would hinder the bailout, which he expected to be approved by the Assembly in the next two weeks. ''We raised the issue as more of a dig at Nassau County than with an expectation of change,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But others are thinking of change. Asked what reforms he would suggest to those who set the admissions policy at Nassau County parks, Mr. Stern said, ''Let my people in.''</p>
