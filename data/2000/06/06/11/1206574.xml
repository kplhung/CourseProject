        <p>THE last few weeks have been unusually acrid in the Senate, with rhetorical eye-gouging more typical of the fractious House of Representatives than the stately Senate. The low point came on May 17, when Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, lobbed verbal volleys at each other in an angry, arm-waving screaming match on the Senate floor, largely over the right of the Democratic minority to offer its legislative priorities as amendments to unrelated bills. Legislative gridlock ensued.</p>
        <p>When the Senate returned last week from a 10-day recess, both leaders seemed a tad chastened by their outburst.

        <p>THE last few weeks have been unusually acrid in the Senate, with rhetorical eye-gouging more typical of the fractious House of Representatives than the stately Senate. The low point came on May 17, when Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, lobbed verbal volleys at each other in an angry, arm-waving screaming match on the Senate floor, largely over the right of the Democratic minority to offer its legislative priorities as amendments to unrelated bills. Legislative gridlock ensued.</p>
        <p>When the Senate returned last week from a 10-day recess, both leaders seemed a tad chastened by their outburst. Like a married couple after a bad fight, Mr. Lott and Mr. Daschle began patching things up, trading olive branches in the form of legislative wish lists for the remaining days before the August recess.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, the Senate approved a major campaign finance measure last week (though it rejected a bill to overhaul the nation's managed care system). Nonetheless, both sides concede that the truce is shaky, and that the next partisan breakdown could be just around the corner. Let's eavesdrop on the spitting match that launched a thousand insults.</p>
        <p>ERIC SCHMITT</p>
        <p>It all started after Republicans and Democrats passed a pair of dueling symbolic votes on gun safety. Republicans at first tried to block their rivals' resolution, but relented after Democrats complained that Mr. Lott was stifling debate, the mother's milk of senatorial life. The senator begged to differ.</p>
        <p>There were a number of things said earlier today on which I just bit my lip and took it because I thought, for the greater good of the chamber, we should get an agreement and move forward. . . . I also feel personally maligned [dramatic pause for emphasis] and I do not appreciate it. . . .</p>
        <p>At this point, Mr. Lott's voice rises in anger. His face is taut and he starts waving his left arm toward Senator Daschle, who is standing a few feet to his left.</p>
        <p>I do not think we have any God-given rights in this institution. We all have certain rights, and I am going to work to protect those rights. . . . I am getting really tired of people questioning my commitment to the Senate and to the opportunity for debates. . . .</p>
        <p>I tell you, what I am trying to do is find a way for the Senate to do its work. These charges that are leveled against me are nonsense. . . . People talk about that civility has broken down, and there is acrimony. That is ridiculous. I think we have a very good relationship here. . . . What it is really all about is getting the work of the Senate done, dealing with real bills and real issues, not playing games. . . .</p>
        <p>As far as order and comity, I support that. I am going to do everything I can to continue to support that. But I think for us to have basically one, two, three, four days tied up having debate on gun amendments instead of having debate on Kosovo and the military construction appropriations bill is not the way we should be operating. . . .</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott holds his folded speech in his hand, sounding mortally wounded.</p>
        <p>I have to go on the record saying I do believe I have been maligned unfairly. I have bent over backward to try to give notice when we were going to call up a bill and to have cooperation with the Democratic leadership to make sure senators had a chance to make their case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott's final salvo drips with sarcasm.</p>
        <p>But to come in here and think we have to have a right to offer non-germane amendments to every appropriations bill that comes through, and then criticize us for not getting our work done -- Oh, boy, that is really smart, really smart.</p>
        <p>Yes, we demand our rights to offer our issues. By the way, why aren't you guys getting those bills done? I do not believe the American people are being fooled by all of this.</p>
        <p>Having said his piece, Senator Lott yields to Mr. Daschle, who begins calmly, smiling.</p>
        <p>Let me say the majority leader was able to get some things off his chest. . . .</p>
        <p>I will tell you this. The way the Senate is being run is wrong. No majority leader in history has attempted to constrain Senate debate as aggressively as Senator Lott has chosen to do. . . . That is his right. He has chosen the way he runs the Senate. I think he is doing that for what many believe is a laudatory reason. He is trying to protect his members so they don't have to vote on tough issues. . . . But no majority leader has ever gone to the extent that he has. . . .</p>
        <p>The usually placid Senator Daschle starts chopping the air for emphasis, and his voice rises in anger.</p>
        <p>Why do we want to have a debate on amendments? Because that is the only ability for the minority to express itself. . . . The majority leader has phrased it very interestingly. He said: I don't want all these amendments to cause trouble. The more they cause trouble, the more in jeopardy the bills will be. . . . Over and over and over and over again, we are told that is the way it is going to be.</p>
        <p>One of our colleagues the other day said it is like the frog sitting in a pot of water who doesn't notice that the water keeps getting hotter and ultimately the frog boils to death.  Well, the water continues to heat, and we are slowly boiling to death, procedurally. . . .</p>
        <p>I hope, when we are in the majority, we understand the rights of the minority. I will admonish my colleagues to do that. But this is getting to be more and more a second House of Representatives. This is getting to be more and more a gagged body. This has nothing to do with the traditions of the Senate that I admired when I became a senator. . . .</p>
        <p>The senator then delivers an ultimatum.</p>
        <p>We have drawn the line. We are not going to be conducting business as we have in the last several months. That is over. That is behind us. We can do it the Senate way, or we are not going to do it at all.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle stops. Mr. Lott, looking down at his lectern, exasperated, lashes back.</p>
        <p>If that is the way it is going to be, then that is the way it is going to be. . . . I am not going to be threatened and intimidated by the minority in trying to get our work done. If you want to go through this approach, if you want to shut down everything, then everybody loses in the process.</p>
        <p>We can cooperate and we can get these bills done. . . . But on both sides, we have senators who want to offer things that will cause mischief and delay or kill a bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott quickly shifts from a stern lecturing voice to a scold.</p>
        <p>I have tried to avoid having an acrimonious relationship. Maybe it is unavoidable in this election year, but I think that would be a shame for the American people because, after all, that is about whom we should be thinking. . . .</p>
        <p>But if we are going to hold our breath, turn red in the face and threaten, then that is the way it will be. But everybody needs to understand that in that kind of relationship nobody wins; everybody loses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle, noticeably calmer, slips on his glasses and wraps things up with a flourish.</p>
        <p>Let me just say no one wants to stomp their feet and get red in the face -- certainly not me. That is not my style. If it has happened, it is only because the frustration level continues to mount. . . .</p>
        <p>I am not trying to get excited here. But let me just say as softly and sincerely as I can: That is not cooperation. That is a Senate version of dictatorship that I think is unacceptable.</p>
