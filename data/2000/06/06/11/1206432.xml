        <p>All the trappings were there -- the evening gowns and envelopes, the spotlights and speeches, the hoofers and the hopefuls.

        <p>Winners, Winners. . .</p>
        <p>All the trappings were there -- the evening gowns and envelopes, the spotlights and speeches, the hoofers and the hopefuls. It was like the Tony Awards, but the faces were fresher and the cheering was louder when the Helen Hayes Performing Arts Center in Nyack presented its first High School Theater Awards last year. (Pleasantville High School swept the competition, which involved 18 schools from Westchester, Rockland and Orange Counties.)</p>
        <p>This year 30 schools, including 11 from Westchester, will be represented at the ceremony, on Tuesday at 7 p.m. at Caramoor.  Pelham High School and Pleasantville High School lead in the nominations, with four each. Tickets are $25 for adults, $20 for students. Information: (914) 358-6333.</p>
        <p>. . . and More Winners</p>
        <p>After sifting through a pile of nominations and commendations, the Westchester Arts Council has chosen nine recipients for its annual Arts Awards.</p>
        <p>Those selected by a panel of nine judges are Jimmy Hill, jazz musician and founder of Youth Theater Interactions in Yonkers; James Karales, a documentary photographer based in Croton-on-Hudson; the Westchester Choral Society; the Greenburgh Arts and Culture Committee; Dee O'Brien, a Larchmont Shakespeare teacher; Billie Tucker, an arts coordinator at the New Rochelle Public Library; the Westchester Chamber Orchestra, cited for its Summer Jazz Institute for homeless children; Westco Productions, which brings theater to children; and Felix and Joan Dolan, traditional Irish dancers.</p>
        <p>''There were more submissions than ever this year -- a very large cross-section of groups and individuals,'' said Abby Popper, chairwoman of the awards committee. ''It wasn't an easy selection -- they were all good, all worthy.'' In winnowing out the winners from 36 nominees, the committee recognized popular favorites like Mr. Hill, who won an Individual Award. But it also turned the spotlight on the kind of quiet achievement that often goes unnoticed. For example, the Greenburgh Arts and Culture Committee, which conducts poetry and writing contests and runs an art gallery for children, is mainly the work of one person: Sarah Bracey White, herself a writer (pictured at left).  The Westchester Choral Society includes members who have sung with the group for more than 40 years.</p>
        <p>The awards are honorary rather than monetary and will be presented by such figures as the newscaster Tony Aiello, the jazz artist Etta Jones and the actress Frances Sternhagen at a luncheon to be held June 19 at 11:30 a.m. at the Rye Town Hilton. Tickets to the event, part of the county's Millennium Celebration, are $35 for artists and staff members of arts organizations, $55 for the general public. For information, call (914) 428-4220, extension 243.</p>
        <p>In Black and White</p>
        <p>It seems a long time ago that black-and-white imagery ruled supreme in art photography. Experimental work has burgeoned since Ansel Adams set the standard for print technique and Edward Weston transformed vegetables into lusciously shaded abstractions. Many photographers still prefer to work in black and white, however, and some of the best are represented in a new book, ''Black and White Photography: Manifest Visions/An International Collection,'' edited by Jim Luciana and published by Rockport Publishers. Three members of the Ground Glass, based in Rye, are included:  Ann Lawrance Morse, Helene Penn and the group's founder, Renata Rainer.</p>
        <p>Best in Music Education</p>
        <p>What are America's 100 best addresses for music education? In a national Internet survey, four groups -- the American Music Conference, the National Association for Music Education, the Music Teachers National Association and the National School Boards Association -- set out to determine which school systems have worked with their communities to develop the best music  programs. Ranking seventh was White Plains, where music is required for all students in Pre-K through eighth grade and is an elective in high school. Mamaroneck came in 53rd. The schools of Farmington, Mich., and Coppell, Tex., tied for first place.</p>
        <p>Local, Now National, Gems</p>
        <p>The Peter Augustus Jay House in Rye (pictured above) and Philipse Manor Hall in Yonkers have both been named official national gems by Save America's Treasures, a public-private partnership between the White House Millennium Council and the National Trust for Historic Preservation.  Hillary Rodham Clinton is the honorary chairwoman of the two-year-old program, first proposed by President Clinton in his 1998 State of the Union address, which has  generated more than $44 million in private funds for the preservation of 500 sites.</p>
