        <p>Brian Lyons finds himself in an enviable position. On Friday, Brian will graduate from Hamilton High School West, outside of Trenton, second in his class.</p>
        <p>The 17-year-old straight-A student scored 1570 out of a possible 1600 on his College Boards and he has been accepted at some of the country's top universities. But he won't be going to any of them in September.</p>
        <p>In what is a longstanding but little-known phenomenon, a relatively small number of students -- usually boys -- choose to undertake a year of additional study at an exclusive prep school, including those in New Jersey, before heading off to college.</p>
        <p>In Brian's case, he will attend the Lawrenceville School in the fall, where he will be one of a group of students who want to polish their academic or athletic resumes. Each year, schools like the Peddie School and the Hun School of Princeton as well as Lawrenceville take on from 6 to 25 postgraduate students. As good as the students may be, many come to improve their chances of getting into a better school. In addition, students headed to military academies, foreign students wanting to improve their English and others who simply need another year to mature make up some of this group.</p>
        <p>''People take the postgraduate year for a number of reasons,'' said Ian Gracey, associate dean of admissions at the Lawrenceville School. ''Often, they feel that they aren't ready for the rigors of college life, and they want a year to mature. It does a world of good for most people. My younger brother did a postgraduate year and he just blossomed.''</p>
        <p>The programs are not usually advertised or pushed by guidance offices, so many students hear about them through word of mouth. Most will live on the campus and, while about 30 percent receive financial aid, the year will be as costly as college with tuition and board -- about $25,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gracey said that the Lawrenceville School usually got 90 applications each year from students seeking to do postgraduate work, of which it accepts about 25.</p>
        <p>''We look for someone with a great sense of initiative, and we like to see them adding something to the community in arts, athletics or having students from around the world,'' Mr. Gracey said.</p>
        <p>The median combined College Board scores are over 1220, he said.</p>
        <p>Marty Mooney, associate director of college counseling at the Peddie School in Hightstown, which takes from 15 to 20 such students each year, said these programs were not for students ''who bombed out in high school.''</p>
        <p>''You look for a spark in these kids,'' Mr. Mooney said. ''This is a nice steppingstone for them.''</p>
        <p>But it's not an easy step. Mr. Mooney said that most students were shocked by the rigorous academic demands and campus regulations. At Peddie, students have a required study time from 8 to 10 p.m. every weeknight. If they are going out on weekends, they must sign out and go where they said they were going. Smoking is taboo, and students are expected to participate in community service projects.</p>
        <p>Drew Biemer, 19, of Haddonfield just completed his postgraduate year at the Peddie School and plans to attend the University of Richmond, where he will play football.</p>
        <p>Drew said that when his parents first suggested the year at Peddie, he balked. Now he's glad he put in the time.</p>
        <p>''It did a lot of good for me,'' he said. ''At times it drove me crazy, but the end definitely justified the means.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Biemer said he also felt that the school's diverse student body broadened him socially. ''I feel more attached to some of these people than the people I knew in high school,'' he said. ''It's a lot more of a melting pot.''</p>
        <p>For students from middle- and upper-middle-class suburban districts, the postgraduate year often proves to be a time to live in close quarters with students from totally different cultural and economic backgrounds. Last year, Mr. Mooney said, an athlete from Cranbury was rooming with a very academically oriented student from Thailand who always stood up when he studied, and it was a learning experience for both of them.</p>
        <p>''Lots of times this was the first time they've lived and worked with kids of such multicultural backgrounds,'' Mr. Mooney said.</p>
        <p>Dr. James Byer, headmaster of the Hun School of Princeton, which takes 6 to 12 postgraduate students each year, noted that the schools also gained by the presence of the postgraduates.</p>
        <p>''We expect them to be leaders,'' Dr. Byer said. ''They add a degree of leadership that enhances the school environment.''</p>
        <p>For Michael Chiusano of Medford, who attended Shawnee, a large regional public high school, his year at Lawrenceville meant admission to Princeton University in 1999, where he is playing football.</p>
        <p>''I always wanted to go to Princeton, and I got rejected and I wasn't happy about that,'' Michael said. ''I was young and would have been 17 starting college. It was the greatest year of my life so far, and it prepared me for Princeton.''</p>
        <p>While the year helps some students get into Ivy League schools, they should not assume that they are buying an automatic ticket to  admission. Harvard University, for instance, gets applications from 2 to 20 candidates a year who are completing a postgraduate term.</p>
        <p>''A good year is a help and better is always better,'' said Marlyn McGrath Lewis, director of admissions for Harvard College, but it is by no means a guarantee into a school where fewer than 11 percent of the applicants are accepted. ''Every case is different, and there's no formula for this.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mrs. McGrath Lewis said she has never met a student who regretted taking the extra year, even if he did not get accepted by  his first choice for college. ''I've never heard people say it was a mistake,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Daria Guelig, 16, who recently graduated from Wellsboro High School in a rural area of north-central Pennsylvania, was accepted by William and Mary College, but she has decided to spend next year at Lawrenceville.</p>
        <p>''I thought I wouldn't really be prepared for college right away,'' Daria said. ''I think I could handle college, but Lawrenceville will be a good way to really prepare me. When I went there, I just fell in love with it.''</p>
        <p>As for Brian Lyons from Hamilton High, he realizes that a lot of people do not understand why he is going to Lawrenceville this fall even though he was accepted by seven colleges, including the University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins and Cornell. But the 6-feet-2-inch, 235-pound lineman said his dream was to play varsity football for Harvard, Princeton or Cornell. He hopes to add 20 pounds to his frame and show an excellent academic record.</p>
        <p>''I'm young, so a year of maturing would be good,'' he said.</p>
