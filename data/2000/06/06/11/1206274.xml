        <p>The newly opened Crypta Balbi museum is the place to find out what happened to the city of Rome between the fall of the empire and the city's revival under the Renaissance popes.

        <p>The museum, which is part of the National Roman Museum, is divided into two sections. In one, visitors are invited to imagine changes to the site by examining the remains of the Crypta Balbi -- a vast porticoed courtyard attached to a theater built in 13 B.C. by Lucio Cornelio Balbi, a patrician in Augustus's circle -- some medieval walls and a 16th-century convent built for the daughters of Roman prostitutes. The development of the complex is then traced to the 20th century.</p>

        <p>The newly opened Crypta Balbi museum is the place to find out what happened to the city of Rome between the fall of the empire and the city's revival under the Renaissance popes. Fittingly, the museum's rooms occupy a series of adjacent houses and palazzi that were connected through the centuries to suit successive home improvement projects.</p>
        <p>The museum, which is part of the National Roman Museum, is divided into two sections. In one, visitors are invited to imagine changes to the site by examining the remains of the Crypta Balbi -- a vast porticoed courtyard attached to a theater built in 13 B.C. by Lucio Cornelio Balbi, a patrician in Augustus's circle -- some medieval walls and a 16th-century convent built for the daughters of Roman prostitutes. The development of the complex is then traced to the 20th century.</p>
        <p>The second section examines the social makeup of Rome from the 5th to the 10th century. On view are hundreds of artifacts that emerged during excavations at the site as well as from other recent digs in Rome.</p>
        <p>The idea for the museum was born about 20 years ago, when an archaeological dig began on the museum site, which was then an abandoned area in the heart of Rome.</p>
        <p>Work on the museum itself began in 1997, and it opened in April. Other buildings nearby are being restored and will become part of the complex as they are completed.</p>
        <p>Crypta Balbi, via delle Botteghe Oscure 31, is open Tuesday through Sunday 9 a.m. to 7:45 p.m. Admission $3.85. Information (39-06) 481-5576.</p>
