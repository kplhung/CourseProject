        <p>THE ENDURING SHORE</p>
        <p>A History of Cape Cod,</p>
        <p>Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket.</p>
        <p>By Paul Schneider.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 367 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>A John Macrae Book/</p>
        <p>Henry Holt &amp; Company. $27.50.</p>
        <p>One of my father's favorite stories about Cape Cod concerned various putative 17th-century discoverers from Europe who dropped anchor at what they believed was terra incognita only to be greeted by aboriginals in Elizabethan black serge waistcoats, flourishing sabers or arquebuses and all the while speaking English in hospitable accents. Paul Schneider offers evidence in his engrossing new book, ''The Enduring Shore,'' that such encounters (minus the arquebuses) actually occurred. Bartholomew Gosnold, in 1602, was confronted by confident, nattily turned out and well-shod natives; and in early 1621 Miles Standish of the Mayflower met Samoset, who said: ''Welcome. You from England? I know some Englishmen.''</p>
        <p>This is salutary documentation, for on the Cape and Islands the oral tradition, with its habitual improvisation, is still strong. All my life I have been hearing about Cape wrecks and their treasures and ''mooncussers''; how the numerous rocks in a Cape garden are from the glaciers, and the many lakes and ponds in the Cape from the last Ice Age; how people were able to harpoon whales just off Barnstable, and thereafter boiled the blubber in vats all over the dunes at Sandy Neck; about the free blacks who took up residence in Mashpee, and the people called Bravas -- half Indian and half Portuguese -- who were the Argonauts of the Cape (my high school English teacher, Miss Thayer, claimed descent from a Brava family); about the Ten Men From Saugus, who founded the town of Sandwich in 1639; about the Indian burial grounds and the Indian forts that stood on hills (a number of places on the Cape are named Fort Hill). And: ''This was covered with trees years ago, Paulie! The Pilgrims cut them down!''</p>
        <p>Some of this history and speculation is found in the authoritative but dense and rather solemn ''Cape Cod: Its People and Their History,'' by Henry C. Kittredge. The many other books -- ranging from Thoreau to Henry Beetle Hough and John Hay and Henry Beston -- are characterized by their Yankee peculiarity. Scholarly and well documented, they are also expressions of an individual point of view, partisan in the best sense, with the felicity and sly wit that are the traits of the born-and-bred local historian. The Cape has produced few real scholars but many village explainers. Thoreau is not an exception. His ''Cape Cod,'' which is one of the thinner books, is a posthumous compilation of sardonic lectures and articles he produced in order to make a living.</p>
        <p>Paul Schneider's book falls within this tradition of helpful and intelligent peculiarity, even to the extent -- in spite of its subtitle, ''A History of Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket'' -- of ranging quite far from home: to Hawaii and the South Pacific; to Cape Verde, South America, the coast of Maine and even as far afield, in every respect, as Boston (for Boston's traditional connection has always been to the North Shore, rather than the Cape). Schneider's account is historical as well as topographical, and instead of chronology we get a happy blend of the dramatic, the colorful, the outlandish and the monumental. Though the narrative starts with the Wampanoag man Epenow in flight from his English captors in 1614, we are soon in a kayak with the author splashing across Vineyard Sound to the mostly privately owned Elizabeth Islands, and in a subsequent chapter the entire subject of this book is covered in a creeping mass of ice, leaving behind such delightful landmarks as interlobate moraines (the north-south ridge that runs from Orleans to Truro), recessional moraines (troublesome shoals such as Hedge Fence and Middle Ground) and the terminal moraines that shaped Nantucket and Chappaquiddick. In a word, the whole area above and below sea level was born of glaciation -- rocks pushed by massive shunting ice packs from Maine and New Hampshire shaped the Cape and Islands and the ocean floor and littered the land with boulders. Ice that melted in place gave the Cape its more than 500 symmetrical kettlehole ponds.</p>
        <p>Quite rightly, a large portion of the book describes the first inhabitants of this area, Wampanoags and Narragansetts, who were at loggerheads -- this animosity a great help to any visiting foreigner who wished to form an alliance and supply weapons. Everyone visited -- the Vikings, 16th-century fishermen, fur traders and adventurers from Europe, gold-seekers, castaways, pirates. Champlain made a fleeting visit in 1606 and was whupped and sent packing by the Nauset Indians.</p>
        <p>The Pilgrims were, relatively speaking, late arrivals -- there had been contact for 110 years by the time they wandered ashore at what is now Eastham and found themselves in immediate conflict with the locals. After the first years of misery and death, the Pilgrims and other settlers branched out, founded towns, deforested the place (most of the trees had been cut by the mid-19th century) and, after the peace of the Mayflower Compact, provoked the bloody rebellion known as King Philip's War. (King Philip was the sachem Massasoit's younger son, Metacomet.)</p>
        <p>The history of the Cape and Islands in the 19th century is to a large extent the history of whaling, its rise and fall. Schneider uses the tribulations in the Pacific of the whaleship Essex to illustrate the bravery and bad luck of whalers. Melville was so struck by the drama of the Essex (deliberately battered by an indignant and maddened whale, which at last brained itself by sinking the ship) that he used it as the end of ''Moby-Dick.'' One of the ironies of the Essex saga is that fearing for their lives at the hands of Fijian anthropophagi, the desperate crew headed east in small boats and wound up cannibalizing its own unfortunate dead.</p>
        <p>Much of Schneider's history refutes the oral tradition. We think of the class consciousness and snobberies as having been imported by people from ''off-Cape'' or ''off-Island.'' But we find that such pretensions have roots extending into the 18th century. Similarly, the Cape and Islands' rivalries and stereotypes, notoriously vicious, go back hundreds of years. The book is an excellent account of the high points in the history, from Pilgrims of the past to the tourists of the present, who in their search for the better life have a great deal in common with those early settlers. With the average price of a house in the region of $600,000, you would have thought the real estate market on Nantucket to be sluggish, but the opposite is the case. Nantucket is projected to be built out by 2037, and in a mere five years there will be no more new building land left on the Vineyard. The height of Cape and Islands hubris is the habit of placing expensive houses smack on the tide line. And both the locals and the summer people are obsessively private and intensely, as well as comically, territorial. It is no surprise that the two hottest topics today throughout the area are the awful traffic and the servant problem. Schneider does not say so, but the fastest-growing number of foreign immigrants to the Cape are Brazilians, and nearly all of them are service workers and menials.</p>
        <p>In such a modest-sized history there are inevitably omissions, some more serious than others. There is just the briefest mention of the unique community of vigorously signing deaf people that existed on the Vineyard, described in Nora Ellen Groce's ''Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language'' and in Oliver Sacks's ''Seeing Voices.'' No mention of the winds that blow from all points of the compass (sometimes on the same day) with dramatic and differing effects; not enough on the weather generally, and especially of the tides, which can vary up to 11 feet. (The tides have been a significant factor in the many wrecks and groundings, not to mention decisive in the tragedy wrought by Teddy Kennedy at the Dike Bridge in Chappaquiddick.) A book that has room for my name (though Schneider gets my town wrong) ought to mention this. I would also like to know more about how Provincetown became a summer festival for the gay community; and about cranberries. And while Schneider explains the politics of the various Indian nations, we get little on their languages or culture or mythology. In spite of these quibbles, for anyone who wishes to know how the Cape and Islands came to be, Schneider's book is the best place to start. And his helpful bibliography and suggestions will take the reader the rest of the way.</p>
        <p>I wonder about the ''enduring'' in the title, though. There is a place on the Upper Cape where my grandparents and my father dug clams. I dug clams there. My children dug clams. The last clams we dug were in the late 1970's. Now it is signposted ''Area Closed to All Shellfishing.'' That is unconscionable; it is a disgrace. Yes, the Cape and Islands endure and they are lovely, but they have changed for the worse and their decay could have been prevented.</p>
