        <p>In an effort to reduce the number of cars in Yosemite, a public bus system is now making scheduled runs into the national park from three surrounding counties.</p>
        <p>The Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System (Yarts) is providing service to Yosemite Valley along Highway 140 from a terminus in Merced, west of the park; passengers can catch a bus at a number of points along the route, and buses make several stops in Yosemite.

        <p>In an effort to reduce the number of cars in Yosemite, a public bus system is now making scheduled runs into the national park from three surrounding counties.</p>
        <p>The Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System (Yarts) is providing service to Yosemite Valley along Highway 140 from a terminus in Merced, west of the park; passengers can catch a bus at a number of points along the route, and buses make several stops in Yosemite. There will  be about 14 daily departures during the summer.</p>
        <p>In addition, there is weekend service from Coulterville, also west of the park, and there are daily trips from the valley floor to Wawona inside Yosemite's southern entrance. Weekend service from Mammoth Lakes, southeast of Yosemite, started Memorial Day weekend</p>
        <p>The new service, which connects with Yosemite's existing shuttle system, will run all year, although departures will be far more frequent in summer. Most trips are made with large touring buses, and fares vary depending on distance.</p>
        <p>The trip from Merced to the valley visitors center takes about two and three-quarters hours one way and costs $15 round trip, $14 for ages 4 to 12 and seniors; from El Portal, just west of Yosemite, the trip takes about an hour and costs $7 round trip, $6  for children. The park entry fee ($20 a vehicle for up to seven days) is included in the fare.</p>
