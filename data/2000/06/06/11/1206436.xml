        <p>WHEN Len Desiderio thinks of the Republican Convention, he doesn't think of hoopla at Philadelphia's First Union Center or George W. Bush giving a rousing acceptance speech or even a Republican landslide in November.</p>
        <p>Not that Mr. Desiderio isn't a good party soldier. After all, he is the Republican mayor of this Jersey Shore town. But he sees the convention in a completely different light.</p>
        <p>''It's July and it's going to be very hot in Philadelphia,'' said Mr. Desiderio. ''The people are going to arrive early just to get settled and they are going to see Independence Hall and all and they are going to want to dash to the Atlantic Ocean. I want the businesses in Sea Isle City to be ready for them.''</p>
        <p>From Cape May at the southern tip of the state to Bergen County in the north, businesses of all types are aiming to catch some of the fallout of the Republican convention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Desiderio, for instance, has persuaded restaurants and shops here to hold a special Republican National Convention festival from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on July 30, the Sunday before the start of the proceedings. There will be tents set up in the middle of the town's beach promenade with a food court and live bands. There will also be half-day fishing excursions, and buses to Cape May.</p>
        <p>And eat your hearts out, you boogie boarders who have been harassed by prowling adolescents checking beach tags, delegates will be able to avoid paying fees by flashing their convention badges.</p>
        <p>Jim Flemming hopes those delegates will be wearing T-shirts printed at his business, South Jersey Graphics of Audubon, in Camden County. Mr. Flemming saw an article in a local newspaper during the winter that Philadelphia 2000, the local coordinator for convention activity, was looking for local businesses to provide services and goods for the convention.</p>
        <p>''I went in and showed them samples of shirts we had done for a job a few weeks before, a full-color, ornate job,'' he said. ''When I talked to the people there, it seemed they were predisposed to do what they could locally and so I expect we will do several thousand pieces for them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Flemming went on enthusiastically: ''They are paying a fair price, not too high or too low. I wasn't going to do this merely altruistically. And I'm hoping everything will go well and we'll get some long-term business out of it.''</p>
        <p>Russ Berrie and Company of Oakland, in Bergen County, has also contracted with the convention organizers to provide gift items to sell to delegates, visitors and collectors.</p>
        <p>''We make a variety of what you would call Americana items -- you know, teddy bears wearing flag sweaters, ceramic pieces with the American flag motif,'' a company spokeswoman said.</p>
        <p>For Bob White and Bob Krol, the week of the convention is no little matter. They are the general managers of the two largest hotels in Cherry Hill, the Hilton and the Four Points Sheraton. Between the two hotels, there will be 600 rooms booked for a week by convention participants.</p>
        <p>''Normally, midsummer would be an average business week,'' said Mr. White, the manager of the Hilton. ''We're busy in the summertime, but rarely sold out. This is a real boon.''</p>
        <p>Although the assignment of delegations to  hotels has not yet been completed, Mr. Krol, manager of the Sheraton, said he had been told that he would probably be getting three delegations -- from Maine, South Dakota and Puerto Rico -- while Mr. White is hoping for a big prize at the Hilton, the New Jersey delegation. In any event, both men expect the week to be a lucrative one.</p>
        <p>''Other than informing everyone that they can't take vacations that week, I don't expect any problems,'' said Mr. Krol. ''The people in charge have been organized. There is a pretty intricate shuttle system, and we have known about most things well in advance.''</p>
        <p>There has already been a bit of spillover for smaller businesses. A few miles from the Sheraton in the quaint town of Haddonfield, the nine-room Haddonfield Inn has seen some added interest. The innkeeper, Deana DeSpirito, put the name of her bed and breakfast on the Philadelphia 2000 Web site a few months ago.</p>
        <p>''So far, we haven't had any reservations for convention week, but we have had some business for other weeks from people who got our name from the site,'' Ms. DeSpirito said. ''I expect we'll get some more closer to the time when people realize they can't get into the Hilton or other big hotels.''</p>
        <p>Farther north in Camden -- in the shadow of William Penn's hat -- much has been made of the clearance of the commercial properties on the south side of the Admiral Wilson Boulevard, long a tawdry strip connecting the city with its more prosperous suburbs. Just last week its symbolic centerpiece, the Fantasy Showbar topless palace, met the wrecking ball, and eventually the south side of the boulevard will be a landscaped park with bike and jogging trails.</p>
        <p>''Don't belittle the contribution of the clean-up of the Admiral Wilson Boulevard,'' said Judi London of the Coopers Ferry Redevelopment Agency, a prime mover in the redevelopment of Camden. ''It is representative of what New Jersey is doing to impress the delegates, and the nation is watching. The advent of the Republican Convention is getting this project done more quickly. That has to be good for business.''</p>
        <p>Not only will the convention's opening ceremonies be held on the riverfront in Camden, with its view of the Philadelphia skyline, but Ms. London said the Thomas Kean New Jersey State Aquarium and the Sony E-Center -- both anchors of the Camden waterfront -- would also be sites of delegate or corporate events throughout convention week.</p>
        <p>In addition, the state Department of Transportation said that later this month it would be erecting ''Welcome to New Jersey'' signs along the highways leading from the bridges over the Delaware. And the A. J. Meerwald, the state's official tall ship normally docked at the South Jersey shore, will be in Camden during the convention.</p>
        <p>There will also be three tours sanctioned by Philadelphia-2000 for delegates in Camden County: a riverboat ride to the aquarium from Philadelphia; a combined tour of the aquarium and Victorian-inspired Haddonfield; and a visit to Walt Whitman's house in Camden.</p>
        <p>Atlantic City -- still a bit gun-shy from the Democratic National Convention there in 1964 -- is planning little special for the convention. Since President Lyndon B. Johnson's nomination was assured, the media turned its attention to the Queen of Resorts and found that most amenities had long since abdicated. In fact, many locals there have blamed the negative publicity for hastening the slide of the city's reputation.</p>
        <p>But in Cape May County, the Department of Tourism is indeed making a pitch for convention-related business. Diane Weiland, the county's director of tourism, induced the convention organizers to sanction a couple of tours to the Shore on the weekend before the official festivities begin. On Saturday, July 29, delegates who sign up will be able to tour Cape May, and on Sunday there will be a $49 tour of North Wildwood's Hereford Lighthouse and the amusement piers and water parks on Wildwood's boardwalk.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Weiland said she was a little wary of the timing, since the delegates leave Philadelphia at 10 a.m. and stay at the shore only until 3 p.m.</p>
        <p>''I don't know that the time spent on the buses, maybe four hours, is really worth the five hours on land,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But that should not be the last the shore will see of convention visitors. ''We're hoping that they will be thinking, July. Hot. Beach. And find a way to get down here either before or after the convention. Besides, there are wives, husbands, families of delegates that, after they sit in the sun waiting to see the Liberty Bell, will find a way to take a day trip down here and we want to be prepared for them. There are only 2,200 people on the convention floor and, supposedly, 45,000 coming here. That's a lot of business possibility for us.''</p>
        <p>For Ted Finkenauer, the convention is a give-a-little-now, gain-a-little-later kind of event. Mr. Finkenauer, a vice president of  for Samples Partnership in Atco, attended a South Jersey Chamber of Commerce meeting several months ago where the organizers of Philadelphia 2000 made a pitch for volunteerism during the convention.</p>
        <p>''I am a big believer in what goes around, comes around,'' said Mr. Finkenauer, who pledged his 65-employee company, which does contract packing, to filling and packing the souvenir bags that delegates and the media will get during the convention.</p>
        <p>''They said there will be 21,000 bags to fill and pack with these little gifts and things sponsors will be handing out,'' he said. ''It's not too bad. We'll set up an assembly line and get it done. And hopefully people will like our work and love the convention.</p>
        <p>''You are not going to make a business on five days of a convention,'' he noted. ''But if you use it to get the secret out that this area is a good place to do business in that time, then you can build on that. So I consider this a good investment of time for us.''</p>
