        <p>SEVERAL major airlines announced rules last month restricting pets traveling as passengers' checked luggage in  the baggage compartments of planes, at least during the summer.

        <p>SEVERAL major airlines announced rules last month restricting pets traveling as passengers' checked luggage in  the baggage compartments of planes, at least during the summer. But industry sources say that seasonal embargoes are just the beginning and that airlines are soon likely to require that pets going by air be handled by commercial shippers, a more expensive proposition for the owners. A medium-size dog traveling as luggage may cost $50 one way; shipped professionally, with someone charged with going to retrieve the kennel if the weather turns bad or the flight is canceled, the cost may be $700.</p>
        <p>Pet owners may be unhappy, but the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which considers air travel a poor choice for pets, is on the airlines' side, said Nancy Blaney, who heads the organization's national legislative office in Washington. The hazards are great if animals end up waiting among the suitcases in extreme heat or cold when a connection is missed. The A.S.P.C.A., along with other animal advocates, believes the hazards are lessened if cargo companies take on the task when animals absolutely must travel by air. Animals with breathing difficulties, pug-nosed ones for example, should never go by air, experts say.</p>
        <p>The airlines' recent actions do not affect the transport of small animals -- cats, small dogs, hamsters and such -- in the cabin in under-the-seat kennels; this is still permitted, with limits on numbers, by seven major domestic airlines, but not Southwest, which does not carry pets at all.</p>
        <p>While Delta Air Lines said on May 12 that it was embargoing the travel of pets as checked luggage for June, July and August, and 10 days later Continental announced a year-round rule that after June 1 larger pets would be accepted as cargo only, the steps did not seem to be linked directly to recent Congressional adoption of the ''Boris Bill,'' which requires airlines to report to the government the total number of animals carried and how many die or are injured. Boris is a dog whose dreadful trip to New York in 1996 gave rise to a campaign for greater care for animals in the air.</p>
        <p>The new restrictions come at the season when extreme heat often leads airlines to refuse animals anyway. In addition, airline spokesmen say the number of people taking their pets on vacation has been rising steadily, although no one has an accurate count. And, as one airline spokesman said on condition of anonymity, an airline would rather pass up the $50 it charges for checking an animal as luggage than risk the barrage of bad publicity that follows a pet's injury or death.</p>
        <p>This does not mean that dogs and cats cannot travel by air. Despite the apparent anomaly, experts agree that they usually travel better as cargo than as accompanied luggage. Continental's new rule requires owners to ship pets as cargo with the company's Quickpak Live Animal Program, which the line says has a 24-hour help desk and climate-controlled vehicles for connections in Houston or Newark. The airline says the cost depends on the size of the kennel, with an average price of $170.</p>
        <p>Pet owners may also use professional animal shippers, although shippers generally say they do not move pets for vacation trips. There are 93 worldwide members of the Independent Pet and Animal Transportation Association, Box 747, Highway 2869, Big Sandy, Tex. 75755; www.ipata.com.</p>
        <p>These companies transport animals for families that are moving. Millie Woolf, head of Air Animals in Tampa, Fla. (Web site www.airanimal.com) and spokeswoman for the group, said: ''The airlines have more control over cargo than over luggage. It's booked in advance and prearranged.''</p>
        <p>As for accommodating the vacationing dog, she said she'd work it out, but it is an impractical option. She said she took animals only from clients like I.B.M. that had established an identity with her. ''I need a week to make an individual person a known shipper,'' she said. ''It will cost a minimum of $700 each way because if it is going to be a hot day, I have to pick up the animal to get it to the airport at 6 a.m. while it's still cool. And make arrangements for it to be met.</p>
        <p>''A woman from Miami called me last week because her dog had to go to Boston for his four weeks at the lake. I told her it would cost $1,000 each way. The weather's fine now. When that dog comes back, it will be too hot in Miami. To be sure the animal arrives in a cool period, I may have to route it through California on the red eye. That can't be good for a dog. We recommend a dog sitter.''</p>
        <p>Rules for shipping animals are explained by the Air Transport Association at www .air-transport.org; click on Pet Travel Guidelines. The A.S.P.C.A. advice is found at www.aspca.org; type ''travel'' in the search box. The United States Department of Agriculture has a site at www.aphis.usda.gov. Government requirements for transportation of animals can be heard at (800) 545-8732 and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service can be reached at (301) 734-7833 between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.</p>
