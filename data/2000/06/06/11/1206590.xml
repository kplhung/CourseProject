        <p>IMAGINE Microsoft's top officials sitting down with an agitated William H. Gates and Steven A. Ballmer, their fuming chief executive, moments after the headlines reporting the unthinkable start crossing computer screens at the company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters: ''Last Appeal Turned Down.''</p>
        <p>They never believed it would come to this when Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled so long ago that the company had violated antitrust laws and should be split in two. They still feel, as the company's lawyers had argued at the time of the trial, that breaking the company up is not only unjustified but also a ''hopelessly complex'' assignment. They fear that skilled employees, Microsoft's main asset in the fast-evolving software business, will abandon the company in droves.</p>
        <p>But there is no point in whining when the challenge at hand is to transform this disaster into a launching pad for future prosperity. The cliche on everyone's mind is making lemonade out of lemons. They look at one another and wonder how many in the room will decide it is not worth the trouble.</p>
        <p>Of course, if such a meeting ever occurs, it will not be Microsoft's first discussion of the unthinkable. Although Microsoft says that it has not done so yet, the company will certainly have begun serious planning for the court-ordered breakup before its last legal card is played. Painful as it might be for Mr. Gates and the other senior managers who have led Microsoft's 23-year ascent from start-up to colossus, their obligations to shareholders, employees, suppliers and customers will not allow them to assume until the bitter end that the company will emerge whole from its antitrust nightmare.</p>
        <p>Indeed, if Microsoft heeds the advice of many experts, it might conclude long before the appeals process is exhausted that the best course is to hasten the split -- especially if it can negotiate more favorable terms in a consent decree.</p>
        <p>''They need to move forward at Internet speed,'' said Jeffrey K. MacKie-Mason, a professor of information economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. ''Even if they win the appeal, they'll face further lawsuits if they continue doing business as they did.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, uncertainty about the future could spur the exodus of talent that Microsoft fears most. ''The worst thing you can do is spend months studying the optimal plan,'' said Patricia L. Anslinger, a corporate strategy consultant with McKinsey &amp; Company, summing up her research on divestitures.</p>
        <p>The absence of deadlines allows battles to fester over intellectual property, key people and other assets. Employees fret about their compensation, job security and where to focus their effort. Recruiters love such turmoil -- and raid with a vengeance when they see it, Ms. Anslinger added.</p>
        <p>''I think they should embrace the breakup concept,'' said Roger McNamee, a partner at Integral Capital Partners, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif. ''These are really talented people. It will unleash a creative energy that is good for customers and employees.''</p>
        <p>IF the day comes when Microsoft follows Mr. McNamee's advice -- or simply runs out of legal maneuvering room -- the company will not have to look far for pertinent lessons from other corporate splits.</p>
        <p>''There are hundreds of divestitures each year,'' noted David I. Levine, an economics professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley. ''There is nothing historic, in an organizational sense, in dividing a large company.''</p>
        <p>Recent examples include Hewlett-Packard's spinoff of Agilent Technologies, the divestiture by General Motors of its Delphi parts subsidiaries, and AT&amp;T's 1996 spinoffs of Lucent Technologies and NCR, the largest voluntary breakup ever.</p>
        <p>That same year, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing divested Imation, which included data storage and imaging businesses with well over $1 billion in annual sales but scant profits.</p>
        <p>''We were a start-up, a turnaround and a large company all at the same time,'' said William Monahan, Imation's chairman and chief executive, recalling the company's tough early months.</p>
        <p>One of 3M's first steps was to address what experts say could be Microsoft's biggest challenge -- calming employees -- by sorting out within just two weeks of the spinoff announcement who would go with Imation and who would stay with 3M.</p>
        <p>Mr. Monahan said he felt it was crucial to quickly recruit a strong, independent board of directors -- including Marvin Mann, who had led Lexmark, the printer manufacturer, through its spinoff from I.B.M.</p>
        <p>He brought in outside executives to round out his 3M-bred team, including Robert Edwards, a chief financial officer experienced in mergers and acquisitions from his days in the railroad industry, and Brad Allen, an investor relations executive known on Wall Street from his days at Digital Equipment and Cray Computer.</p>
        <p>Another early priority for Mr. Monahan was benchmarking against other companies, including Lexmark, to establish an appropriate set of best practices. ''Management has to have a good idea of what's possible,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the single most important lesson that Mr. Monahan learned was the need to aggressively focus the newly independent business on serving its customers.</p>
        <p>''You are busy establishing new reporting systems, a new supply chain and many other things that impact a lot of your people,'' he said, projects that can easily divert attention from customers' needs.</p>
        <p>Because of Microsoft's heavy reliance on stock options, revising pay packages would be one of the trickiest problems that Microsoft would face in any breakup.</p>
        <p>''Most companies don't have so many people with enough wealth to matter tied up in options,'' Mr. Levine said.</p>
        <p>Past practice at other companies suggests that Microsoft options would be rewritten so that employees ended up with most of their wealth tied to the stock of whichever Microsoft offshoot they joined. But that would redistribute risk in ways that could quickly become painful, if the stocks moved in different directions.</p>
        <p>''There's no easy answer,'' Mr. Levine said.</p>
        <p>Compensation is closely related to another key divestiture issue: the creation of new corporate cultures. Experts say one of the most common mistakes in corporate split-ups is that both parties maintain their familiar methods of communication, evaluation, training and promotion, along with benefits and behaviors that make up a company's spirit.</p>
        <p>''If you don't try to create a new culture, employees see no change other than being smaller,'' Ms. Anslinger said.</p>
        <p>The involuntary nature of the Microsoft breakup and the limits on its future conduct imposed by Judge Jackson would present special challenges.</p>
        <p>''Both sides will still be monopolies barred from a lot of things other companies do every day in forming strategic alliances,'' said Benjamin Gomes-Casseres, a professor who studies such cooperative ventures at Brandeis University's Graduate School of International Economics and Finance.</p>
        <p>The best response, some experts say, would be for each side of the business to examine aggressively all the technical options that had been closed off by the need to support the old, integrated company.</p>
        <p>''Stressing the new opportunities should energize the employees,'' said Willow Sheremata, who teaches technology management at Tulane University. For example, she said, Microsoft software applications like Word might blossom with a range of useful new attributes if programmers were pushed to develop versions for Linux and other operating systems, instead of maximizing their fit with Microsoft's Windows operating system.</p>
        <p>But other strategists said the applications arm, like any other business, should make its major markets its priority. That would mean working as closely with Microsoft's operating arm as the government will allow.</p>
        <p>THAT does not mean, though, that the two companies should continue to live side by side on the sprawling suburban campus headquarters that is home to nearly half of Microsoft's 38,000 employees.</p>
        <p>Physical separation is an important aid to a successful divestiture, said Mr. Monahan, who moved Imation from 3M's campus in St. Paul to Oakdale, Minn., several miles east.</p>
        <p>''Where we stayed put in 3M buildings overseas for economic reasons, people were slower to move on emotionally,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Which company gets the Microsoft name, which keeps the Redmond campus, how the patents and other intellectual property are divided up, how Microsoft's cash ($21 billion as of March 30) is distributed -- all are issues that would have to be resolved before a split.</p>
        <p>But a decisive question for many of Microsoft's constituencies, from Wall Street to the lowliest programmer -- and, therefore, one of the first that ought to be settled in any breakup -- is Whither Bill?</p>
        <p>''Bill Gates may be a convicted monopolist,'' Mr. Levine said. ''But he's the world's most famous executive, and arguably the most successful.''</p>
