        <p>Dan Rather is one of the last of the great, booming, authoritative voices in network journalism. He is TV news straight, no chaser. Warm and cuddly he is not. The Rugrats, however, are. These animated brats, with their own cartoon show on Viacom's Nickelodeon channel, are as devilish as they are cute.</p>
        <p>But the sign that Viacom has erected at its Times Square headquarters to ballyhoo its merger with CBS features the authoritative Mr. Rather with the Rugrats climbing all over him. It emphasizes the breadth of the new company, which, its executives like to boast, reaches consumers from the cradle to, well, at the least, adulthood.</p>

        <p>Dan Rather is one of the last of the great, booming, authoritative voices in network journalism. He is TV news straight, no chaser. Warm and cuddly he is not. The Rugrats, however, are. These animated brats, with their own cartoon show on Viacom's Nickelodeon channel, are as devilish as they are cute.</p>
        <p>But the sign that Viacom has erected at its Times Square headquarters to ballyhoo its merger with CBS features the authoritative Mr. Rather with the Rugrats climbing all over him. It emphasizes the breadth of the new company, which, its executives like to boast, reaches consumers from the cradle to, well, at the least, adulthood.</p>
        <p>How does Mr. Rather feel about this use of his likeness by the new company, whose chairman is Sumner M. Redstone? A representative for Mr. Rather read a dutiful response: ''I don't know the Rugrats personally, but I hear they are friends with Sumner Redstone. Any friends of his are friends of mine.''</p>
        <p>This week, the sign will be replaced with one of David Letterman and Blue, the dog from the Nickelodeon cartoon show ''Blues' Clues.''</p>
