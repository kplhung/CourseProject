        <p>People living near a Sanitation Department garage at 545 East 73rd Street have complained for months about garbage trucks lining their block, beginning before dawn, and creating a noisy, stinking eyesore for much of the day. Now the department has good news for the rattled residents, sort of. The problem should be resolved when the garage is renovated, but that could take seven years.</p>
        <p>''The garbage truck dance starts every morning at 4:30,'' said Chris Hulbert, who lives at 509 East 73rd Street, near York Avenue. ''The engines begin revving and then the beeping begins as the trucks back up.'' He said as many as 20 trucks lined the block and were often left idling, even unattended.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hulbert said he began to notice  the problem about eight months ago, when the Sanitation Department transferred a number of trucks from a garage at East 215th Street and the East River.</p>
        <p>James Dewar, who lives on the fifth floor of the building that houses the garage, said the noise was a frequent topic of conversation among neighbors. ''I feel really bad for the families on the lower floors,'' he said, adding that the trucks monopolized parking spaces and made access to the sidewalk and buildings difficult.</p>
        <p>City Councilman A. Gifford Miller, who represents the area, has complained to the Sanitation Department on the residents' behalf.</p>
        <p>''The sanitation trucks are often idling and full of trash -- leading to serious problems of odor and fumes,'' he wrote in one of two letters to the agency, adding that the block provided access to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and that the idle trucks created extra congestion as drivers tried to navigate around them.</p>
        <p>Peter Fenty, a spokesman for the Sanitation Department, said it took one hour to move all 105 trucks in the garage onto the street. ''The way the garage is situated and constructed, it's very difficult to get them all out as each shift begins,'' he explained. ''So it's done one hour before so workers have ready access to the vehicles.'' Mr. Fenty insisted that there were never more than ''a very few'' trucks on the street at any one time.</p>
        <p>But, once completed, the planned renovation of the garage should make it unnecessary for the trucks to line up on the street in advance of the shifts, Mr. Fenty said.</p>
        <p>And during the construction, the  congestion will be reduced by the relocation of 50 trucks to the department garage on 215th Street.</p>
        <p>That move should create ''a significant reduction in truck traffic and much less hassle on the street,'' Mr. Fenty said. ''The residents will see relief.''</p>
        <p>As the construction proceeds, however, the trucks will still line up on the street, although Mr. Fenty said their idling would be controlled.</p>
        <p>The renovation will begin in July and will include some asbestos removal, he said. The project, Mr. Fenty added, could take ''upwards of seven years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hulbert, for one, was unimpressed. ''They can put a high-rise up in one year,'' he said. ''And they need seven years to renovate a garage?''</p>
