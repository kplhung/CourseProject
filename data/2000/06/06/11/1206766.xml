        <p>The French think Champagne on Bastille Day. Americans don't on the Fourth of July. But proper celebration of Independence Day requires more than Bud Lite or its sparkling-wine equivalent, Korbel.</p>
        <p>In 1984, Gilbert Gruet &amp; Fils, a small Champagne house in France, planted its tricolor in, yes, Albuquerque, N.M., and ever since has been making one of America's best -- and best-priced -- sparkling wines from New Mexican grapes.</p>
        <p>The label, Gruet, first flew into New Yorkers' radar when the restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten introduced it at Jo-Jo in 1991. On and off, he has stocked it at his four-star Jean Georges.</p>
        <p>Though federal regulations and deference to the integrity of the appellation and uniqueness of Champagne require most American producers to call their wares sparkling wine, Gruet is Champagne in spirit and content. It rises to June-wedding levels.</p>
        <p>Gruet nonvintage chardonnay-based brut -- dry, spare, lightly fruity, delicately yeasty, bright with racy applelike mouth-watering acidity and tiny bubbles -- is an aperitif and dinner-long wine, especially with surf courses.</p>
        <p>The fuller, rounder but still lean nonvintage brut blanc de noirs, the pinkish hue in its coral-gold color reflecting pinot noir, is pretty. Drink it lightly cool, and you'll relish the tea roses and young watermelon in the bouquet.</p>
        <p>The brut is $13 and blanc de noirs $14 at Union Square Wine and Spirits, 33 Union Square West (East 17th Street), and the brut is $15 and blanc de noirs $16 at Ambassador, 1020 Second Avenue (54th Street), in Manhattan; both wines are $15 at Paley, 88 Seventh Avenue (Union Street), Park Slope. Brooklyn.</p>
