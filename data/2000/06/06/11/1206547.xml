        <p>EVERY New York tourist attraction has a hipper alter ego. For Shakespeare in the Park, there's Shakespeare in the Parking Lot; for P.S. 1, there's P.S. 122; for the Rainbow Room, there's the view from your accountant's 49th-floor window.</p>
        <p>Now, for the Brooklyn Bridge's well-trod pedestrian path -- a kind of Coney Island boardwalk in the sky -- there's the recently opened route along the south side of the Williamsburg Bridge. Not surprisingly, it's as brash and varied as the neighborhoods it connects.</p>
        <p>One recent afternoon, under the Brooklyn Bridge's famous cables, a vendor was doing a  brisk business in soft drinks, hot dogs and pretzels. Tourists spoke Japanese and German; New Yorkers pushed baby carriages, snapped photos, and, in a few cases, acted as if they had climbed Roebling's structure for no other reason than check the cell phone service over the East River.</p>
        <p>On the Williamsburg Bridge, later the same afternoon, no one was chatting, and no one was taking pictures.  People on this path are going somewhere -- don't get in their way. The exception are the Satmar Hasidim -- the men in their mink hats and satiny black waistcoats, the women more demurely attired -- who have a new place to amble on Shabbos. One group of seven or eight Hasidic children, all wearing matching clothing (including plaid jumpers, jackets and shorts) and flapping their arms as they ran across the bridge, evoked nothing so much as the ''Do-Re-Mi'' scene in ''The Sound of Music.''</p>
        <p>A parallel path on the north side of the bridge -- now crowded with construction equipment -- is scheduled to open in 2005. It will be reserved for cyclists, leaving the south path, with its views of Lower Manhattan and the Brooklyn Navy Yard, to foot traffic. Until then, that path, like so many New York institutions, has to be all things to all people.</p>
        <p>Still the crowded byway is, by all accounts, a big improvement over the shadowy, pothole-ridden route it replaced last year, a turn-of-the-century promenade that had been allowed to deteriorate badly.</p>
        <p>Ben Stewart, a Ph.D. student who is writing his dissertation on bicycle messengers, and who commutes over the Williamsburg almost daily, says the old path was so dangerous ''You couldn't really take it after midnight.'' (For Williamsburg's  young residents, who hang at the Bowery Ballroom till the wee hours, that's a problem.)</p>
        <p>One afternoon, a policeman riding a motorcycle across the bridge opined, none too reassuringly: ''It's safe up here, because the thieves think it's still under construction.''</p>
        <p>If they do, it's because of the Erector set quality of the path, which for most of its length looks like a construction crane turned sideways.</p>
        <p>On the Manhattan side, it begins with a flight of 46 metal stairs -- a  discouragement to many bikers and bladers (although homeless people have been known to drag supermarket shopping carts up the gargantuan flight). From the top of the stairs, it's about a half mile on wooden boards that seem to have shrunk since they were installed, leaving scary gaps. (If you look down from a moving bike, the boards appear to flicker, like the blades of a fan -- and suddenly there's nothing between you and Delancey Street, as much as eight stories below.)</p>
        <p>From there, another stairway and four right-angle turns -- further discouragements -- lead to the main event: a blacktop path over the roadway, a pristine, milelong surface that's catnip to graffiti artists. (The generic pedestrian, stenciled on the path by the city, is now sprouting wings, elaborate headdresses, and genitalia.) Finally, there's the approach to Brooklyn, a quarter-mile descent through a sloping cage of cherry red metal. The ramp ends at the Williamsburg Art and Historical Center, now crammed with surrealist paintings. If you didn't stop at Ratner's on the Manhattan side, Peter Luger's steakhouse is around the corner, as is a beer garden called, somewhat incongruously, the Right Bank Cafe.</p>
        <p>If you return after dark, riding or walking through what is really a gigantic metal catwalk (with some surprising turn-of-the-century flourishes), you'll feel as if you're inside the Eiffel Tower after closing. But then a subway train -- J, M or Z --  glides by at eye level, reminding you that this is New York at its most compelling. You can see the passengers, but they don't even know you're out there.</p>
