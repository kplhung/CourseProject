        <p>PAPAL SIN</p>
        <p>Structures of Deceit.</p>
        <p>By Garry Wills.</p>
        <p>326 pp. New York: Doubleday. $25.</p>
        <p>Most large organizations have a procedure for repudiating the actions of a chief executive who has made autocratic and disastrous decisions. In theory, the Roman Catholic Church does too: a General Council has the right to change church doctrine or policy. But in the last couple of centuries, papal bullying has reduced councils to impotence. So Catholics who think, as does Garry Wills, that the papacy is disgracing the church have no one to turn to except their fellow congregants.</p>
        <p>Wills, an eminent historian and one of the most intellectually distinguished members of the Catholic laity in the United States, has written a devastating, no-holds-barred, indictment. In Part 1 of ''Papal Sin'' -- Historical Dishonesties'' -- he shows how the hierarchy has persistently lied and weaseled about what the church did and did not do during the Holocaust. Part 2 -- Doctrinal Dishonesties'' -- argues that recent popes have turned Leninist: they have cared more about retaining their grip on authority than about the needs of those whom they claim to serve.</p>
        <p>In the last two parts of the book -- The Honesty Issue'' and ''The Splendor of Truth'' -- Wills writes about his heroes: Lord Acton, Cardinal Newman and St. Augustine. He offers them as exemplars to whom the church might turn in order to escape from the Orwellian ''structures of deceit'' currently built into papal practice.</p>
        <p>In 1864, Pius IX denounced those who dared assert that ''the Roman Pontiff can and should reconcile himself to, and come to terms with, progress, liberalism and modern civilization.'' Lord Acton -- like Wills, both a distinguished historian and a scholar quite able to meet the Vatican's theologians on their own ground -- realized that Pius was making Catholicism look ridiculous. So Acton did everything he could to persuade the First Vatican Council not to give Pius what he most wanted -- ratification of the doctrine of papal infallibility. Acton lost that fight, but only after Pius had used every trick in the book to whip the conciliar fathers into line.</p>
        <p>Pius IX is, Wills says, ''a presence in the Vatican to this day.'' Present-day papal deceitfulness and arrogance are, for Wills, most vividly illustrated by Paul VI's taking the question of birth control out of the hands of the Second Vatican Council. Paul, he says, was terrified that the fathers would repudiate the anticontraception pronouncements of Pius XI, who in 1930 had announced what Monty Python called the ''every sperm is sacred'' view. (''The Divine Majesty,'' Pius XI wrote, ''regards with greatest detestation this horrible crime,'' that is, spilling one's seed upon the ground, or into a condom.) So Paul decided that it would be better to make life miserable for further generations of Catholics than to allow the Council to admit that a predecessor had goofed. Wills says that ''Humanae Vitae,'' Paul's 1968 encyclical reaffirming the ban on contraception, ''is not really about sex. It is about authority. Paul decided the issue on that ground alone.''</p>
        <p>Wills uses this episode to make his central point: ''The pope alone, we are now asked to accept, is competent to tell Christian people how to live. . . . The Holy Spirit now speaks to only one person on earth, the omnicompetent head of the church, a church that is all head and no limbs. If that were so, then the body of Christ would be shamefully reduced.'' But he has many other examples of dishonesty: tortured interpretations of Scripture, blatant distortions of ecclesiastical history, endless hypocritical whining and just plain lies. He is startlingly frank on issues that most Catholic writers avoid, as when he writes, ''In fact, the admission of married men and women to the priesthood -- which is bound to come anyway -- may well come for the wrong reason, not because women and the community deserve this, but because of panic at the perception that the priesthood is becoming predominantly gay.'' He is equally blunt about the present pope, whom he describes in the same sort of terms Acton used of Pius IX: ''The rest of the church must live in structures of deceit because this one man is true to his intensely personal vision.''</p>
        <p>A non-Catholic might conceivably have written the first 15 chapters of Wills's book -- the chapters that turn over rocks and reveal prelates desperately covering up previous cover-ups. But only somebody caught up in the history of the church, and a regular participant in the Mass, could have written its last six chapters. In these, Wills asks his fellow Catholics not just to overthrow papal tyranny, but to renounce the conviction that their church holds the keys of Heaven.</p>
        <p>Wills has no use whatever for the doctrine of the Apostolic Succession -- which claims that Rome but not Canterbury or Salt Lake City can supply priests who inherit from the apostles the power to transubstantiate the elements of the eucharist, thereby enabling the faithful to partake of the very body and blood of Christ. He would prefer that the theory of transubstantiation had never been dreamed up, and that priests and bishops were still chosen by communities of the faithful (as they were in Augustine's time) rather than appointed by the Curia's personnel office. The church of Wills's dreams ''would not restrict the priesthood to priests -- to magicians of the eucharistic transformation. It would not deprive whole communities of their own priests rather than relax a code of celibacy never imposed on the apostles.''</p>
        <p>In a chapter that Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger and other Vatican dinosaurs will regard as the height of impudence, Wills deplores the cult of the Virgin. He suggests that Catholics locate the feminine element of the divine in the Third Person of the Trinity -- whom he refers to as ''She'' rather than ''It.'' Many Catholics who have no time for Ratzinger may think this too far out. But they may nevertheless find themselves amazed by what Wills has to tell them about the absence of most contemporary Catholic doctrine (including Mariology) from Scripture and from the beliefs of the faithful in the first four centuries after Christ -- as amazed as were the Catholics of Luther's time to hear some of the same things. Yet Luther had no wish to split the church, nor does Wills. He hopes for internal reform rather than schism. He wants the next pope to play Gorbachev to Pius IX's Lenin.</p>
        <p>Wills takes with utter seriousness the text (John 14:6) that says that Christ is truth. He praises Augustine as the theologian who best understood and explicated this claim, and as authority for the view that ''the new papal sin, of deception, is worse than the vivider old sins of material greed, proud ambition or sexual license. It is spiritual sin, an interior baffling of the Spirit's access to the soul.'' But Wills might have a harder time getting Augustine to go along when he says: ''I do not think that my church has a monopoly on the Spirit, which breathes where She will, in every Christian sect and denomination. In fact, She breathes through all religious life, wherever the divine call is heeded, among Jews and Buddhists and Muslims and others.'' That is the language of Acton's 19th century, not of Augustine's 4th.</p>
        <p>Wills is a historian of American freedom whose writings have breathed new life into the words of Jefferson and of Lincoln. Predictably, he wants a free and democratic Catholic Church, one which has no time for heresy hunting, and in which the popes live up to their ancient title: ''servant of the servants of God.'' Yet Augustine spent a lot of time detecting and denouncing heresies, and so must any institution which is going to claim a special, privileged, hookup with the divine. If God really is generous enough to acknowledge the Jews and the Buddhists as heeding his call, then it is not clear why we need a church of Christ. But if we do need such a church, then it will exclude as well as include, and heresy hunting will remain an inevitable exclusionary strategy.</p>
        <p>The church's traditional view has been that God is not that generous, and that Christians must believe that Christ's apostles and their authorized successors -- but not those of the Buddha or Joseph Smith or Muhammad -- provide the necessary means to salvation. For better or worse, Augustine would have agreed. Wills does not. The momentum of his splendidly passionate polemic leaves him confronting the question: Would an ideally honest and free church of Christ still be a church?</p>
