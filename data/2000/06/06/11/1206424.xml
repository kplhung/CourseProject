        <p>THOMAS A. KIRK JR. has ambitious plans for the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, building on a strong structural foundation, crafted by his predecessor, Dr. Albert Solnit, and other former commissioners. But before he can achieve his goal of leading the department to prominence as the best agency of its kind in the nation, the new commissioner recognizes he must do something about its image.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kirk intends to re-configure the department as a public health care agency, concerned with the well-being of Connecticut's 3.5 million residents, rather than a behavioral services agency, treating only the minority of residents who are mentally ill or have addictions to alcohol or drugs.</p>
        <p>''We as a field have helped create misconceptions and stigma,'' he said. ''People don't choose to have a mental illness or addiction. They may have chosen to use in the beginning, but substances changes the chemistry of the brain. Mental illness has a strong genetic component. We have to work on promoting health and safety and make sure those who develop problems are provided with effective treatment and care.''</p>
        <p>After serving as deputy commissioner since October 1996, Mr. Kirk took over the department on May 1. He has has an annual budget of $414 million and employs 3,600 people. Dr. Solnit, 80, has retired but remains active through his chairmanship of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Mental Health, established by Gov. John G. Rowland, to study mental illness and recommend methods for improving prevention and treatment. The 50-member commission will present its finding by July 1. A similar panel studied the field of addiction and released an in-depth study in 1996.</p>
        <p>Following are excerpts from a recent conversation with Mr. Kirk.</p>
        <p>Q. As its new commissioner, what is your mission for the department, and how do you plan to carry it out?</p>
        <p>A. When I go out of state and compare what I find with our infrastructure and the positive spirit among the nonprofit groups that comprise Connecticut's system of care, I realize D.M.H.A.S. has the chance to be the best agency of its kind in the county. My goal is to provide the people and skills to make that happen.</p>
        <p>I recently brought in a team of mental health and addiction professionals who are the tops in their fields from across the nation to work with 60 or 70 employees for six months. The newly-trained employees will train others, moving us to a whole new level of care.</p>
        <p>I also plan to continue to the strong alliances with commissioners of other state departments and with Yale and UConn to guide the department to higher standards of performance and fiscal accountability, making sure Connecticut's tax dollars are well spent. We will also promote the health of kids and make sure youngsters get the support and skills they need.</p>
        <p>Q. In July 1995, the Department of Mental Health merged with Addiction Services. Has the merger been successful?</p>
        <p>A. I wouldn't use the term merger. Rather, a new department was created from two previous ones. In the beginning, some on the addiction side were concerned the mental-health side would be dominant, and addictions would not be understood. It hasn't been without its bumps, but both fields have people dedicated to better care as their primary concern, and this has made it easier to work things out.</p>
        <p>Q. During the decade of the 1990's, the department completed the shift from institutional to community-based care, closing Fairfield Hills Hospital in 1995 and Norwich Hospital in 1996, and consolidating all inpatient psychiatric services at Connecticut Valley Hospital. Have hospital closures proved effective from a treatment and financial perspective?</p>
        <p>A. With the hospital closures, we invested new money in community services, but we under-estimated. It costs more to provide a broad range of services in the community than bundled in a hospital setting. Medications are better than ever before, but our success has created more demands. The accessible system offers 24-hour access lines and transportation to treatment centers for people who are having critical incidents, but the financial cost is high. Our ability to diagnose conditions is better than ever, but our ability to diagnose and provide services may not be better. There are a whole lot of new challenges that weren't present in 1995. The public hospital system is strained by the pressures from increased admissions and less financial reimbursement under managed care.</p>
        <p>More people are presenting with co-occurring conditions of substance abuse and a mental health disorder. Heroin is readily available, cheaper and purer. Of those patients admitted to residential detoxification centers, 35 percent come for multiple admissions and are most likely to fall into this category if they have heroin or opiate addictions as their primary problem, or if they have co-occurring disorders of mental illness and addiction. One of my great interests is to improve the overall quality of care by paying more attention to these two groups. If bed use for these groups can be reduced, it can be used for other needs.</p>
        <p>Q. The state prison population has swelled to unprecedented levels over the past five years. More inmates have mental health disorders and addictions, according to Department of Correction officials. Have hospital closures and insufficient community services contributed to the rise?</p>
        <p>A. There aren't enough resources in the community, but that isn't to say that people in the prison system didn't do something to warrant incarceration. We need to find alternative ways to treat people. We, in conjunction with the D.O.C. and Office of Policy and Management, are developing a jail diversion program to enable people with mental illnesses and addictions to receive treatment and avoid going to prison. The State Legislature will return to session in June to consider jail diversion programs as a way to solve the prison overpopulation crisis.</p>
        <p>Q. What background and experience do you bring to the position?</p>
        <p>A. As deputy commissioner, I promoted private-state partnerships and cross-agency collaborations between state agencies, including the judicial branch, Department of Children and Families, Department of Social Services, Department of Correction and Department of Policy and Management. Under the present climate, we have people in different roles who have a very collegial spirit and are not caught up with a state bureaucracy mentality.</p>
        <p>Prior to joining the department, I was president for five years of Liberation Programs, Inc., a Stamford, a nonprofit, substance-abuse agency, preceded by 12 years and increasing levels of responsibility at the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services Administration in Washington, D.C. I was assistant professor of psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond from 1966-1973. I earned a Ph.D. and M.A. from Catholic University in Washington, D.C. with a major in experimental psychology and minor in clinical psychology.</p>
