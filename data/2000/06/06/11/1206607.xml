      <abstract>
        <p>Several companies have recently updated time-worn logos, while others have reintroduced old logos to new generation of buyers; experts differ on when and how to update ad icons; some say never, others disagree; never changing an established icon can make a company seem out of date, but efforts at updating can be disastrous; gradualism appears to be best method if an icon is to be updated; another approach is to thrust a well-known icon into new settings, though this can also lead to trouble; photo (M)</p>

        <p>FOR more than a hundred years, thirsty consumers who didn't even know her name have recognized Psyche the nymph as the symbol of White Rock soda. Now, however, slumping sales and a younger target audience have prompted White Rock to give its fragile, bare-breasted bottle girl a bolder look.  The company is favoring a Psyche depicted only in outline with a few deft brush strokes, and who is neither crouched on a rock nor gazing into a pool.</p>
        <p>''She's been a great logo, but she really does look old-fashioned,'' said Laurence Bodkin, White Rock's vice president for marketing. ''We want to be thought of as a vibrant company for the new century.''</p>

        <p>FOR more than a hundred years, thirsty consumers who didn't even know her name have recognized Psyche the nymph as the symbol of White Rock soda. Now, however, slumping sales and a younger target audience have prompted White Rock to give its fragile, bare-breasted bottle girl a bolder look.  The company is favoring a Psyche depicted only in outline with a few deft brush strokes, and who is neither crouched on a rock nor gazing into a pool.</p>
        <p>''She's been a great logo, but she really does look old-fashioned,'' said Laurence Bodkin, White Rock's vice president for marketing. ''We want to be thought of as a vibrant company for the new century.''</p>
        <p>Psyche is not the only ad icon getting a face lift.  Quaker Oats earlier this year unveiled an all-adult version of its memorable 1972 ''Mikey'' television spot for Life cereal. ''Many of us who once identified with little Mikey are all grown up and can now relate to the all new adult cast,'' said Todd Magazine, vice president for marketing of Quaker's Ready-to-Eat Cereals division.</p>
        <p>Yet these updatings come as other famous embodiments of consumer products -- the Jolly Green Giant, Mr. Whipple and Charlie the Tuna among them -- are being dusted off and presented, largely unchanged, to a new generation of buyers. On the cable television station TV Land, vintage commercials featuring such instantly identifiable personae as Mr. Clean, Hawaiian Punch's Punchy, the young Mikey and Clara ''Where's the Beef?'' Peller from Wendy's have become programming staples.</p>
        <p>''Characters in general went out of style for quite a long time,'' said Thomas Hine, author of ''The Total Package: The Evolution and Secret Meanings of Boxes, Bottles, Cans, and Tubes'' (Little, Brown, 1995). ''Obviously a lot of companies are now aware that they have a kind of cultural heritage that they can cash in on.''</p>
        <p>Given that heritage, the question arises: When should an established ad icon be altered to breathe new life into it?</p>
        <p>Never, some experts say.</p>
        <p>''These characters are more beloved than family members,'' said Barbara Lippert, ad critic for Adweek magazine. ''I was on an Oprah show about this subject, and Mr. Whipple [the actor Dick Wilson] came out with a pack of toilet paper. People went wild. He was like Moses carrying the tablets.''</p>
        <p>Others disagree. ''If icons are not kept contemporary, they become recessive,'' said Bob Kuperman, president and C.E.O. of the advertising agency TBWA Chiat/Day, whose creations include the Energizer Bunny and the Taco Bell chihuahua. ''Museums are filled with icons that have not been kept up to date,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sometimes a company has no real choice but to go with the public flow. Quaker's Aunt Jemima eventually lost her bandanna so that she less closely resembled a stereotypical mammy. When the Michelin Man was born at the turn of the century, automobile tires were thin and narrow, but as they bulked up, so did Monsieur Michelin, lest he become unrecognizable.</p>
        <p>But morphing can be a risky business. Take Elsie, Borden's bovine trademark, who was once cited by Advertising Age as one of the top 10 icons of all time. In 1993 she was transmogrified: She spoke, walked on her hind legs, wore pants and owned a dairy store.  The campaign was a disaster.</p>
        <p>''We felt Elsie could relate more to the working woman of the day in a human environment,'' explained Jim Montel, vice president for marketing at American Dairy Brands, Borden's parent company.  ''But it didn't move the product. Consumers did not have any affection for her as a human.''</p>
        <p>If change must come to an icon, gradualism tends to work best. Betty Crocker, for example, is so popular an image that she routinely receives marriage proposals.  But, said Pam Becker, a spokeswoman for General Mills, ''Our whole goal is to connect Betty Crocker with consumers out there, and for that reason we have to change the portrait periodically.''</p>
        <p>La Crocker has been nipped and tucked seven times since her original 1936 appearance, most recently four years ago. Although her features and hairdo have become less dowdy, and she has traded in her house dress for a business suit, she has always been a self-possessed lady in red, thus assuring continuity and familiarity.</p>
        <p>Another approach is to keep a character more or less intact while putting it in an unexpected, attention-grabbing context. ''I've seen print ads for Speedy the Alka-Seltzer tablet wearing sunglasses and a Hawaiian shirt,'' said Warren Dotz, co-author with Jim Morton of ''What A Character! 20th Century American Advertising Icons'' (Chronicle, 1996). ''A lot of characters are modernized by putting them on in-line skates.''</p>
        <p>That path, however, can lead to madness. In 1996, McDonald's plunked its spokesclown, Ronald McDonald, into a variety of grown-up settings -- golf courses, discos, bars -- to promote its new Arch Deluxe sandwich. ''They had him doing some pretty bad things,'' a McDonald's executive told Salon magazine. ''It was a dark moment. A complete, soup-to-nuts fiasco.''</p>
