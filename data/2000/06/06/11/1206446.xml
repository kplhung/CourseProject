        <p>ASK anyone the toughest sport a young man can play in high school and the answer will surely be football or lacrosse. Mayhem in pads in one case, mayhem with sticks in the other.</p>
        <p>Either sport, one might think, would supply enough contact and black-and-blue marks to last a school year.</p>
        <p>Dave Snyder of Brewster High School plays them both. Same year, all four years. And plays them exceptionally well.</p>
        <p>In football, his quarterbacking resulted in only three regular-season losses in four seasons, and two trips to the state championship game.</p>
        <p>In lacrosse he is, if anything, better, the star of the Bears team, which lost the county finals to Yorktown, 10-4, last weekend. His final career scoring totals -- a  record at a school blessed with many fine lacrosse scorers through the years -- are 309 points, on 194 goals and 115 assists. His junior season of 67 goals and 37 assists for 104 points is also a school record. It all adds up to a lacrosse scholarship to Syracuse, the recently crowned national champion and arguably the best lacrosse-playing college in the country.</p>
        <p>What makes a young athlete choose a double dose of rugged play?</p>
        <p>''Why? I don't know,'' Snyder, a solid 85 student and a solid 6-foot-2, 190 pounder, said.</p>
        <p>''I've always loved football -- I've played the game since the third grade. And then, in the spring, baseball was kind of boring, slow and no contact. So when I went to a lacrosse camp after the fourth grade, I just liked it right away and stuck with it. The coach molded me into a player.''</p>
        <p>The coach is the Bears' lacrosse coach, Jerry Walsh. ''In the fifth grade he was already special,'' Walsh said. ''He made the Empire Games team as a freshman.''</p>
        <p>Jim Capalbo, the athletic director at Brewster, added, ''He's an awesome lacrosse player.''</p>
        <p>And Snyder is going to a strong lacrosse school. Syracuse won its sixth national championship by beating Princeton, 13-7, two weeks ago. It finished this season 15-1 and Liam Banks, the attack man who had six goals against Princeton, is only a sophomore.</p>
        <p>''I picked Syracuse,'' Snyder, a mid-fielder, said, ''because I want to play on a national champion.''</p>
        <p>And play he should. The lacrosse coach at Syracuse, John Desko, said that Snyder ''has the ability to contribute right away,'' adding, ''He's a tremendous athlete with tremendous poise.''</p>
        <p>Watching Snyder play in a state championship football game this season helped convince him, Desko said. ''His team was losing as he drove them in the last minute,'' he said, ''but he had just as much composure as at the start of the game. You had to like his competitiveness.''</p>
        <p>Walsh offered a similar example from lacrosse. ''In the last minute, with the score tied, in the county semifinals against John Jay, Dave took the ball behind the goal and worked his man and drew a double team,'' Walsh said. ''With 10 seconds left, he dumped off in front for the winning goal.</p>
        <p>''He's such a good playmaker that I think he will be even better at Syracuse, where he will be surrounded by good players.''</p>
        <p>But in picking the Orange, also a national football power, Snyder may have foreclosed a college football career.</p>
        <p>''Dave started for us at quarterback as a freshman and just got better,'' Capalbo said. ''But he may not have the arm strength to compete at that level.''</p>
        <p>Snyder, the youngest of five brothers who played contact sports in high school, is a leader off the field, too. He was recently honored by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for his work in befriending Brian McPartland of Brewster, a 5-year-old with the disease. ''He's such a great kid,'' Snyder said. ''I've also worked with him at summer camp.''</p>
        <p>Academics will play a part in Snyder's thoughts of repeating his rugged two-sport high school career.</p>
        <p>''I'll take a year off from football,'' he said. ''Get into the swing of things in college. If things are going well -- my grades, too -- I'll try to make the football team as a walk-on my sophomore season.''</p>
        <p>How does one avoid injury playing two such tough sports?</p>
        <p>Snyder shrugged. ''I work with weights all the time,'' he said. ''It's big in our program at Brewster.''</p>
        <p>So, it seems, is playing multiple sports.</p>
        <p>''Actually,'' Snyder said, ''I also played varsity basketball until my senior year. I needed a break.''</p>
