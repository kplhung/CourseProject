        <p>Help-wanted ads are freighted with economic significance far out of proportion to their humble dimensions. Economists put rulers to them to measure economic health. Newspapers depend on them for a big part of their profits. Pundits use their migration to Web sites to ring the papers' death knell.</p>
        <p>What, then, to make of the news from Malmo, Sweden, that at least one employer thinks it can do better by scrawling come-ons on lavatory walls?</p>
        <p>Ikea, the furniture retailer, tried attracting young professionals to apply for copywriting and project management jobs by placing handwritten ads on walls of men's and women's rooms in restaurants in the fashionable Lilla Torget district, spending about one-tenth its usual newspaper ad budget for such openings.</p>
        <p>''After only four days we had received 60 applications -- four or five times more than what we would get from a normal newspaper ad,'' Jimmy Ostholm, a company spokesman, told Kvallsposten, a southern Swedish regional daily, last week. ''In the toilet, people are more relaxed and receptive to our message.''</p>
        <p>For a while, things looked bad for help-wanted lineage in Britain as well. The manager of a government job center in Walsall, Jonathan Stevenson, decreed that employers advertising job openings through the center could no longer describe the workers they sought as being ''hard-working'' or ''enthusiastic.'' His rationale: Those terms could be euphemisms for ''not disabled,'' and so were potentially discriminatory.</p>
        <p>Employers were flabbergasted by the policy, which drew ridicule in the national press and a quick reversal order from the national government in London.</p>
        <p>''They must be the only people left on this planet who don't realize disabled people are as hard-working and energetic as anyone else,'' the employment minister, Estelle Morris, told The Mirror.</p>
        <p>The education and employment secretary, David Blunkettt, who is blind, told Reuters that Mr. Stevenson's ruling was ''nonsense.''</p>
