        <p>When was the last time you took along your checkbook to go shopping? For that matter, how often do you walk out of the house with a wallet full of cash?</p>
        <p>In an age when you can check yourself out at the grocery with a credit or debit card, cash and checks may seem old-fashioned. But consumers are not ready to forgo them. A recent study by the Synergistics Research Corporation showed that people still made more payments by check each month than by credit cards.</p>
        <p>Synergistics, an Atlanta company that serves the financial services industry, conducted a national survey in December of 800 consumers with incomes of at least $25,000, representing about 60 percent of all households, said Genie M. Driskill, Synergistics' chief operating officer.</p>
        <p>''We were looking at the extent to which consumer payment habits were changing,'' Ms. Driskill said, adding that ''historically, cash and checks have been the dominant payment mechanism.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the consumers surveyed said that on average they wrote 20 checks a month, while they used credit cards 13 times a month and debit cards 11 times.</p>
        <p>But when asked what method they used most often for purchases at the point of sale, consumers said they used credit and debit cards combined almost twice as much as checks. Cards accounted for 45 percent of purchases, checks 27 percent and cash 24 percent.</p>
