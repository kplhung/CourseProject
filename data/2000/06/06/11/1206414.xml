        <p>GETTING into the violin is an understatement at Music Mountain in Falls Village. The 1930's pine music shed was built to mimic the interior of the stringed instrument, resonating with the sound of the concert within, a perfect venue for a summer music festival devoted to the string quartet.</p>
        <p>The festival opens today and runs through early September, and in addition to its anchor programming of string quartets, will feature popular jazz groups, Baroque ensembles and a couple of very unusual pre-concert events, one involving dogs.</p>
        <p>Situated on 120 acres of lush hilltop above the Appalachian Trail, Music Mountain is the oldest continuous summer chamber music festival in the United States, said Nicholas Gordon, whose father, Jacques Gordon, founded it 71 years ago as a summer performance retreat for his string quartet. The shed, called Gordon Hall, seats 335 and draws top performers because of its outstanding acoustics.</p>
        <p>''We've had people come to these concerts for 20 to 30 years, who have never been in the hall; its like a loudspeaker, you hear so perfectly outside,'' he said, adding that there is no man-made amplification.</p>
        <p>Gordon Hall, which measures 30 feet by 160 feet, was constructed with hollow walls, air space above and below. The French doors behave like the f-holes in the violin. ''You have a totally suspended, vibrating structure, nothing dampens the vibrating. It radiates sound the way a great big speaker would,'' said Mr. Gordon in a telephone conversation from his home in northwestern Connecticut.</p>
        <p>So fond of the hall's acoustics that he is returning to open the festival in spite of ''mosquitoes the size of dinosaurs'' and uncharacteristic heat, the pianist Vladimir Feltsman will team up with a quartet this afternoon at 3.</p>
        <p>Mr. Feltsman, who was born in Russia and is now an American citizen living and teaching in New Paltz, N. Y., regularly performs with the world's major orchestras.</p>
        <p>In a recent phone conversation, the pianist talked enthusiastically about the program he will play: Schubert's Adagio and Rondo Concertante in F Major, D. 487; Victor Kissine's Piano Trio written in 1993; and the Shostakovitch Piano Quintet (Op. 57).</p>
        <p>''The Schubert,'' Mr. Feltsman said -- ''this is from his middle period, in his 20's -- is a beautiful piece of Viennese music. It's very demanding for the piano, the second half is very fast. I have to practice the damn thing!''</p>
        <p>The Shostakovitch is one of the best-known pieces of chamber music written in the 20th century, and Kissine's Piano Trio, which receives its American premiere this afternoon, enjoys popularity in Europe.</p>
        <p>''It's not too avant-garde,'' said Mr. Feltsman of Kissine's Piano Trio: ''He borrows freely certain elements of different styles and blends together and becomes very much his own music. It is meditative, very poised, very beautiful with a lot of silence; he plays with time very skillfully.''</p>
        <p>Joining Mr. Feltsman in the program are the former first violinist of the Beethoven String Quartet, Oleg Krysa; the violinist Peter Krysa; the violist Boris Deviatov and the cellist Yosif Feigelson.</p>
        <p>Music Mountain's season has a broad array of styles. One highlight will be the appearance on Aug. 6 of the Ludwig String Quartet from Paris giving the world premiere of a work by the American composer Seymour Barab. The piece is entitled ''Winnie the Pooh and Some Bees for Narrator and String Quartet.'' It was written for its narrator, Robert J. Lurtsema, who is best known as host of the radio program Morning Pro Musica. Of the piece Mr. Gordon said, ''It's not juvenile; it's a serious string quartet.''</p>
        <p>A week later, the St. Petersburg Quartet will be performing at the festival. ''The cellist is Peter Rejto,'' Mr. Gordon said, ''and he's playing a beautiful old Italian instrument which he inherited from his father, who, 60 years ago, played at Music Mountain as the cellist in my father's group.''</p>
        <p>Nine concerts are planned for jazz fans: ''The jazz series has proven that there's a huge audience for classic jazz in this part of the country,'' Mr. Gordon said.</p>
        <p>And for Baroque music lovers, John Solum and the Hanoverian Ensemble will give concerts on Saturday as well as on July 21 and Sept. 10, with each concert devoted to a different facet of the period.</p>
        <p>To keep his picnickers and early arrivals entertained, Mr. Gordon has scheduled several unusual pre-concert events.</p>
        <p>On July 9 the festival presents ''The Musical Saw in Recital'' by Stefan Kanfer, saw, and Michael Walsh, piano. On Sept. 3, before the Shanghai String Quartet and the pianist Ruth Laredo close the season, concertgoers will be treated to ''The Canine Quadrille.''</p>
        <p>The dogs and their trainers do a quadrille together to music by Bach and Jean-Pierre Rampal. Will the dancing dogs be allowed to stay for the concert?</p>
        <p>''They're so well trained, they certainly wouldn't bark between movements,'' Mr. Gordon replied.</p>
        <p>The Music Mountain season opens today and runs through Sept. 10. Tickets for the festival, held in Falls Village, are $15 in advance, $18 at the door and $10 for students. Purchases may be made by mail (Post Office Box 738, Lakeville 06039), at the box office on concert day, or by phone at (860) 824-7126. Radio broadcasts of the concerts can be heard in this region on WQXR-FM, New York, WAMC-FM, Albany and WMNR-FM, Monroe. For more information, visit www.musicmountain.org.</p>
