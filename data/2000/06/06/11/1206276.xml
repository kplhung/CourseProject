        <p>I've hated summer at least since I was 7 and blistered the back of my legs with sunburn lying on Jones Beach. But my estivatophobia goes deeper than a mere second-degree burn: summer's hot, people are too happy, clothes stick to you, sooner or later the A.C. gives you a cold, fun is mandatory and that demonic sun is out there like a Middle Eastern dictator -- intrusive, oppressive and still in charge way too late in the day.</p>
        <p>I also realized early on that guns aren't the great equalizers -- bathing suits are. If politicians really mean it when they talk about ''leveling the playing field,'' they'd campaign in bathing suits. J. C. Watts Jr. and Kay Bailey Hutchison would beat everybody, but you could get rid of Jesse Helms, Henry Hyde, Ted Kennedy, several women and Barney Frank.</p>

        <p>I've hated summer at least since I was 7 and blistered the back of my legs with sunburn lying on Jones Beach. But my estivatophobia goes deeper than a mere second-degree burn: summer's hot, people are too happy, clothes stick to you, sooner or later the A.C. gives you a cold, fun is mandatory and that demonic sun is out there like a Middle Eastern dictator -- intrusive, oppressive and still in charge way too late in the day.</p>
        <p>I also realized early on that guns aren't the great equalizers -- bathing suits are. If politicians really mean it when they talk about ''leveling the playing field,'' they'd campaign in bathing suits. J. C. Watts Jr. and Kay Bailey Hutchison would beat everybody, but you could get rid of Jesse Helms, Henry Hyde, Ted Kennedy, several women and Barney Frank.</p>
        <p>Terrifying as thoughts of the coming season are, it does have a couple of zeniths. (I know, it's impossible to have more than one zenith, but with so many nadirs, loosen that syntactical belt a little or you'll be miserable here.) Chief among summer zeniths is crab. (Also chief, which I know you can't have more than one of, is the tomato, to be addressed later.) And so it was mega-bracing to revisit the Marinos, that most cheerful of restaurant-running families, down at Dill's Crab and Oyster Bar in Bridgeton, N.J., just at the moment in April when the crabs were about to swim into their deep-fat fryer. Even if you're an autumnal person, it's tonic to be around people with a passion for what they do.</p>
        <p>And so, to see Everett Marino stirring his and his brother Earl's special crab jus in Dill's narrow kitchen on a bustling Friday night at dinner time -- a crowd of noisy diners just outside in the restaurant, quaffing beer under a replica of a huge shellacked Great White -- instantly got me over my pre-summer doldrums. First cousin Phil is behind the bar, Aunt Frances is in the anteroom, Shirley is in the kitchen and Patsy waits on tables. In fact, there are so many Marinos and Marino Relatives (not to be confused with the Miami Relatives, the new rock band) that you can't swing a dead catfish without hitting one.</p>
        <p>Just a minute. Crab jus?</p>
        <p>Attention ladies and gentlemen</p>
        <p>Please watch your language,</p>
        <p>This is a family restaurant</p>
        <p>Not a truck stop</p>
        <p>(Sign on wall at Dill's)</p>
        <p>''Daddy'd always say, 'Don't come to work with your hands in your pockets, don't ever let me see you sitting down and don't call people older than you by their first name,' ''Everett says affectionately about his father, Everett Sr. ''We were expected to be at a half run the whole day.''</p>
        <p>From the look of things, they still are. Nancy, Everett's wife, who runs the takeout counter by day and puts out fires at night, rushes in to command, ''Three Italian clams!'' -- three orders of steamed clams accompanied by linguine and crab jus. The cook, Cruz (one of the few nonfamily members), wraps 18 clams in a small cheesecloth net that looks like a snood, tosses them into the industrial steamer and, after warming the linguine, puts the opened bivalves on top, ladling a little jus over all, and in less than five, Patsy has the three orders out the swinging door.</p>
        <p>And just as quickly, oysters Rockefeller, fried crab cakes, wined and buttered scallops, sauteed tilapia, broiled crab cakes, stuffed shrimp (a beauty of a 16-to-20-count jumbo shrimp, one quarter of a crab cake attached, the whole thing deep-fried), more crab cakes, fish, fish, fish, a golden flounder and the most popular dish in the restaurant, Jumbo Lump 'n' Linguine (crab meat given the clam treatment), hit the road.</p>
        <p>''Want to taste something good?'' Everett says, handing me a spoonful of the special family fluid. ''This is the base for all our sauces.'' I toss the crab broth down my gullet, and damned if it isn't good enough to drink as soup. I ask for a cup, which startles them, and sip. Sooooo seafood-sweet. Made with beer! ''Oh, here's our daughter,'' says Nancy, as Gina, in sweatshirt and jeans, scoops up that anomaly, a burger, and rushes back out. ''And Mother still keeps the books for us,'' Everett says, looking as though this just might be a mixed blessing.</p>
        <p>Everett Sr. bought Dill's Seafood in 1952, when it was strictly a retailer, and put his family to work. His whole family. ''We're the only family in New Jersey, all of whose seven members worked together for 40 years,'' Everett says proudly. New Jersey? Probably all of America. When Everett Sr. retired in 1971 and left Dill's to Everett and Earl, the boys took over an old 7-Up factory-warehouse and expanded the business into the wholesale, restaurant and takeout conglomeration it is now.</p>
        <p>A friend enters the kitchen and puts a beefy hand on Everett's shoulder. ''I love this guy,'' he says genuinely. ''Come here for my seafood, wouldn't come anyplace else. Best crab cake in the Western world.''</p>
        <p>The smartest thing to do with crabs is pretty much leave them alone. They are so rich and delicate, they're almost bland. Most cooking errors with crabs are made by trying to make them richer (with cream) or blander (with bread crumbs and flour), or trying to wipe them out (by adding strong flavors like green peppers or bacon). Of course, with a crab cake, as with a good steak, truth prevails -- if you don't have an excellent crustacean to begin with, you might as well tart it up with gobs of mayo and mustard.</p>
        <p>Everett pretty much leaves his alone, which is why they're so good. He nudges me and says, ''Sometimes I leave a little piece of cartilage in there just so the folks know they're not eating surimi.''</p>
        <p>Although the Marinos also steam and juice king crab legs that are pure pleasure, they use blue crabs for their other crab dishes. Blues are the tastiest -- and are a plastic surgeon's worst nightmare, since in the warmer season they literally walk away from their previous skins every new moon, almost like reincarnation. (But what have they learned?) Right now there's probably some guy out in Los Angeles doing crab-molting research to see if Faye Dunaway and Michael Jackson can be spared one more assault under the knife.</p>
        <p>Everett and Nancy's four daughters all married ''up,'' and though two work part time at Dill's, none want to be in the restaurant biz. This pleases their parents. ''Because of Dill's, we sent 'em to college so they could do something else,'' says Everett. ''We in the fish business know what hours this takes.'' He hopes to open up a fish school on the premises so that the next generation will know about seafood and ''won't be stuck in the fast-food rut.''</p>
        <p>It's 10:30 p.m., and Dill's kitchen officially shuts down at 10, but a couple of customers straggle in. Though, at 61, Everett is tired (Friday's the toughest day) and suffers from his second bout of rheumatoid arthritis (the first occurred several years ago when he was oystering, but he went into remission), he agrees to serve them Lump 'n' Linguine. The warden from the local prison, who has been chatting in the kitchen for several minutes, chuckles at Everett's generosity. ''This man will never quit the fish business,'' he says. I ask Nancy, ''Would you like him to?'' Behind her husband's back, she nods broadly. ''No, you wouldn't,'' Everett laughs, and ladles some more of that fabulous jus onto the latecomers' fine lump crab meat.</p>
        <p>Marino's Crab Jus  1/3 cup olive oil</p>
        <p>1/2 cup finely chopped garlic  1 cup finely chopped parsley  2 tablespoons finely chopped cherry peppers or long hot peppers (or 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper) 4 teaspoons salt</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon pepper  Six-pack of dull beer (Old Milwaukee or Bud will do fine)</p>
        <p>1/4 pound butter  12-18 hard-shell blue crabs, cooked, dressed, broken in half (save cooking water to use to cook linguine).</p>
        <p>1. In a deep saucepan heat the oil and cook the garlic till soft but not browned. Stir. Add the parsley and cook for a few minutes. Stir in the chopped peppers, salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>2. In a separate pan, boil the beer. The beer will foam, and when the foam dies down, continue to boil for 1 more minute. Add the beer and butter to the garlic mixture and mix well. Arrange the crabs in layers in their cooking pot and cover with the beer mixture. Shake the pan to get the liquid into the crabs. Bring to a boil, quickly lower the heat and simmer the crabs for 7 minutes, shaking the pan to jolt the juice out of the crabs. Do not overcook or the meat will get mushy. Remove the crabs. Serve with linguine below.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 cups.</p>
        <p>Note: Jus can be used to cook any other fish or seafood.</p>
        <p>Lump 'n' Linguine  24 clams or mussels or 1 pound fresh lump crab meat or 16-20-count jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined  4 cups crab jus (see recipe)  1 pound linguine, cooked al dente  Grated Parmesan cheese to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Scrub clams or mussels; pick over crab meat or peel shrimp. (For clams, purge sand by placing in a bowl and covering with cold water. Sprinkle with cornmeal or flour and refrigerate 3 hours. Drain and rinse.)</p>
        <p>2. If using clams or mussels, place in saucepan with crab jus and boil until the shellfish open, shaking the pan and stirring so the juice of the shellfish and crab jus mix. If using crab meat or shrimp, add crab jus and cook until the crab is heated through or the shrimp turns pink. Do not overcook.</p>
        <p>3. Divide the linguine among 4 dishes. Top with clams or crab and the crab jus. Sprinkle with cheese.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Marino's Best Crab Cakes  6 tablespoons butter  2 tablespoons chopped onion  1 tablespoon chopped celery  1 tablespoon chopped parsley  2 eggs  2 tablespoons tartar sauce  1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce  1 1/2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon German-style mustard  1 pound lump crab meat, picked over</p>
        <p>1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon plain bread crumbs.</p>
        <p>1. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium-high heat and saute the onion, celery and parsley until soft, about 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. In a bowl, beat eggs and whisk in the tartar sauce, Worcestershire sauce, Old Bay, pepper and mustard. Add crab meat and  1/4cup bread crumbs and mix. Spoon onto a plate and shape into 4 cakes. Sprinkle one side with  1/2teaspoon bread crumbs and the other side with remaining crumbs. Cover in plastic wrap; refrigerate 15 minutes or up to 3 hours.</p>
        <p>3. Melt the remaining butter in a skillet over medium heat and saute the crab cakes till golden brown -no longer than 3 minutes per side.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
