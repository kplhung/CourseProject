        <p>Detectives have arrested three people on charges of killing a man whose death prompted the authorities to review a police sergeant's performance, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The investigation of the sergeant began after he was called to the murder scene but took no action.

        <p>Detectives have arrested three people on charges of killing a man whose death prompted the authorities to review a police sergeant's performance, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The investigation of the sergeant began after he was called to the murder scene but took no action. The sergeant answered a telephone tip about a stabbing at a Bronx apartment early Tuesday morning and decided not to force open the apartment's door, despite bloody footprints in the hallway outside.</p>
        <p>The next afternoon, the victim, Cesar Ortiz, 40, was found bound, gagged and stabbed to death when his brother returned to the apartment at 1440 Bronx River Avenue, the police said.</p>
        <p>An investigation by detectives from the 43rd Precinct resulted in the arrests of a woman and two men, the police said. The suspects were identified as Altagrazia Reyes, 33, of 500 West 177th Street in Manhattan; Manuel Tineo, 18, of 54 Evelyn Place in the Bronx; and Lorenzo Ferreira, whose age was not available, of 228 Grand Avenue in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>They were charged with second-degree murder and attempted robbery, the police said.</p>
        <p>It was unclear yesterday whether the Bronx Investigations Unit, which examines whether police have followed proper procedures, had completed its review of the sergeant's actions.</p>
