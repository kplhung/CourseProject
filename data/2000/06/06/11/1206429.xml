        <p>I WONDER whether the chef at Cortina Ristorante has spring fever. Or perhaps the manager is more interested in the live music than the service. Because something doesn't seem to be right here. The place just does not live up to the glowing reviews I've read. The atmosphere is not that of an elegant Italian dining room but rather a baroque hotel lobby in Florida. The servers were forgetful yet unrepentant, often insisting that each plate be finished -- plates piled high with food made by chefs I wish I could call innovative.</p>
        <p>However, only a handful of us were puzzled by the experience to be had at Cortina Ristorante. Everybody else was smiling and dancing, and some even got up to sing a Sinatra tune or two on the microphone. After a few meals, I noticed that the majority of the diners had also been there on my previous visits. Obviously the average food and spotty service were not the primary focus. The clientele seemed to put a higher premium on feeling at ease among familiar faces.</p>

        <p>I WONDER whether the chef at Cortina Ristorante has spring fever. Or perhaps the manager is more interested in the live music than the service. Because something doesn't seem to be right here. The place just does not live up to the glowing reviews I've read. The atmosphere is not that of an elegant Italian dining room but rather a baroque hotel lobby in Florida. The servers were forgetful yet unrepentant, often insisting that each plate be finished -- plates piled high with food made by chefs I wish I could call innovative.</p>
        <p>However, only a handful of us were puzzled by the experience to be had at Cortina Ristorante. Everybody else was smiling and dancing, and some even got up to sing a Sinatra tune or two on the microphone. After a few meals, I noticed that the majority of the diners had also been there on my previous visits. Obviously the average food and spotty service were not the primary focus. The clientele seemed to put a higher premium on feeling at ease among familiar faces.</p>
        <p>Perhaps that is because Cortina is situated in a city that has historically dedicated itself to community. Since the days when Alexander Hamilton planned Paterson as an industrial city, it has been boom and bust. Cortina is an example of its latest redevelopment effort. Cortina could easily be a setting for dinner with the cast of the ''Sopranos,'' offering decidedly modern cuisine along with fare that retains its authentic Italian roots (it opened in 1990 as an Italian social club, featuring red sauce and pasta; its owner, Kathie Damato, renovated it in 1995). Up until a year ago, the chef hailed from Le Bernardin, the fine fish restaurant in Manhattan, joined by two sous chefs from Johnson &amp; Wales, the prestigious cooking school in Rhode Island, and the trio quickly turned the place into a ''gastronomic haven,'' as the restaurant's Web site says. Even newspapers, magazines and restaurant guidebooks have reflected that opinion, rating it as ''excellent'' and handing out fistful of stars.</p>
        <p>The present Cortina lacks such leadership in the kitchen, and may as well be stuck in an eddy on the edge of the nearby Great Falls, moments away from tumbling downward along with other failed Paterson projects. While it is still worth a trip to hear the saxophone player Cornelius Bumpus (who tours with Steely Dan), don't expect much from the food. Take the mozzarella Capri, a plate layered with fresh mozzarella, prosciutto di Parma and roasted peppers. The ingredients lacked luster, were poorly seasoned and were overly sauced. The portobello napoleon, pounded thin and coated in a mixture of goat cheese and bread crumbs, was so greasy that it practically slid into its accompanying mound of mesclun greens. Crab cakes, while dense, were composed of bulky seasonings rather than juicy lump crabmeat. Finally, the Caesar salad was prepared ''traditional style,'' the menu said, which in this case meant near the waiter station rather than tableside.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, several appetizers showed potential. The vegetable terrine was beautifully arranged, revealing careful layering of thinly sliced eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes and roasted peppers. The porcini risotto studded with bits of al dente asparagus was hearty and filling, and with a little salt could have been all I needed. The arugula salad topped with walnuts and goat cheese was refreshing and texturally complete. The penne amatrigiana, tossed with tomato, onion and pancetta, was simple and perfectly al dente. I couldn't get enough of the calamari Chino, here battered, fried and tossed in a light hoisin ginger sauce.</p>
        <p>I do recommend the entree specials at Cortina. The gnocchi were even fluffier than my server proclaimed them to be, cradled in a fresh and light tomato sauce. I enjoyed deconstructing the capellini piled with shrimp, crab meat and tender sauteed shiitakes, and I sopped up the last bits of the noodles in their fragrant broth. Tilapia arrived in an orange Grand Marnier beurre blanc, sweet, silken and addictive -- I must admit that as a huge fan of dessert I was wooed by this preparation as a savory twist on crepes suzette.</p>
        <p>Sadly, there were a few plates at Cortina that I will have trouble forgetting, and not because I enjoyed them. The tuna special tasted as if it had just recently been defrosted. The New York steak, whether prepared with green peppercorn sauce or filippo style (coated in a seasoned bread crumb crust), had an off, almost old taste, resulting in a disturbingly chewy feel in the mouth. But the tiramisu was the clincher. It was soaked in a sugar syrup that left a slightly chemical taste in my mouth, reminding me of the sensation you get when you lick an ice cream cone after a dip in the pool.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, Cortina served cannoli -- sweet, crunchy and comfortingly familiar. I focused on this treat as I listened the music and pondered whether I would want to return next week like those beside me. Definitely for the celebratory community feel. Maybe for the fruit di bosco, a moist and tart vanilla cake covered in a blanket of confectioners' sugar. But probably not for the eggy creme brulee or the gummy and dense ricotta and coconut cheesecakes.</p>
        <p>And after a night of being bullied by my server (who never remembered to bring a pasta special to my table), I realized that he too might be more satisfied with the status quo than with pleasing new but most likely not repeat customers.</p>
