        <p>Some police officers enforcing the Giuliani administration's continuing crackdown on quality-of-life crimes are focusing their efforts on a new public menace, according to defense lawyers and prosecutors.</p>
        <p>This spring, a dozen people have been arrested and jailed for a night for smoking cigarettes on Manhattan subway platforms. The formal charge is disorderly conduct.</p>
        <p>The arrests come as defense lawyers say that the city's quality-of-life crackdown, which has long taken aim at turnstile jumpers and marijuana smokers, is continuing and broadening. While city officials credit that approach with driving down crime, defense lawyers assail it as expensive and unfair overkill that frequently involves racial profiling.</p>
        <p>Police officers, they contend, are arresting growing numbers of people for increasingly petty offenses. Mundane offenses that resulted in a summons or a warning in the past, defense lawyers said, now result in a night in jail until those arrested are arraigned.</p>
        <p>The one-night jail terms usually become the punishment for the crime, because most defendants in such cases are sentenced to time served. If they had been given summonses and appeared in court later, they probably would have been fined, but not sentenced to any time in jail.</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers cited a string of arrests this spring as examples.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 5, Officer John O'Reilly arrested a 27-year-old man in Manhattan for selling tamales on the street without a license, according to court papers. The man was held in jail overnight.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 24, Officer Benjamin Kaufman of the 10th Precinct arrested a man for aggressively panhandling by tap dancing in front of a car, then holding his hand out to the driver. The officer stated in court papers that he recovered a nickel from the defendant's hand. That man was also held overnight.</p>
        <p>In interviews, three men recently arrested for smoking on subway platforms expressed astonishment at what had happened to them. One man, arrested at 1 a.m. Wednesday at the 137th Street station of the Seventh Avenue line, said he could not believe that he had spent a night in jail for smoking a cigarette.</p>
        <p>''This is ridiculous,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Two brothers, 20 and 17, who work as dishwashers in a Gray Papaya restaurant, were arrested for smoking in the Christopher Street station on May 9 after working until midnight.</p>
        <p>The men, who asked not to be named, and feared that they would lose their jobs after missing a shift at work, said they did not know a person could be arrested for such an offense in the United States. ''We were just smoking the cigarettes,'' one of the brothers said. ''I was sitting and waiting for the train.''</p>
        <p>Police officials said last week that the quality-of-life crackdown was continuing, but the Police Department has not begun a new campaign against smoking in subway stations. Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a department spokesman, said officers might have chosen to jail some people instead of issuing them summonses because they did not have proper identification, or because there were outstanding warrants for their arrest.</p>
        <p>But the man arrested on Wednesday said he had identification with him and did not have an outstanding warrant. The two dishwashers, who are Mexican immigrants, had no identification with them.</p>
        <p>Steven Pokart, the lawyer for one of the immigrants, called the arrests appalling. Alexandra Bonacarti, the lawyer for the man arrested on Wednesday, who is black, accused officers of arresting black and Hispanic men they see smoking because they believe such people are more likely to have outstanding arrest warrants. Such arrests of wanted criminals look good on officers' records.</p>
        <p>''They're not going to walk up to the average person and harass them,'' she said. ''They absolutely target minorities.''</p>
        <p>David Kapner, the Legal Aid Society's Manhattan arraignments supervisor, said smoking was the latest pretext that the police were using to stop people and check them for warrants or weapons. ''Last spring, they were arresting people for taking up too much space on park benches,'' he said.</p>
