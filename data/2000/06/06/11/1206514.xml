        <p>FASHIONABLE gardeners know that when it comes to keeping your beds up to date, vigilance is essential. Every new season has its surprises. A few years ago there was a tremendous vogue for variegated foliage.</p>
        <p>Old garden favorites such as wiegela and hydrangea suddenly appeared in public with deliberately mottled leaves. Striped and spotted stalwarts like hosta and lungwort (Pulmonaria) were in demand after languishing for years in the shade of more modish plants.</p>
        <p>Now, of course, it is absolutely necessary to have a garden full of blue spiky things. As far as I can tell, this trend began a two years back when the Perennial Plant Association named Russian blue sage (Perovskia) Plant of the Year. Now the catalogs are full of blue salvias and veronicas. It is inevitable that lavender will join the ranks of spike-topped horticultural celebrities.</p>
        <p>The signs are there already. In the past five years a host of books have been published on the sweet-smelling herb. The number of lavender cultivars available through catalog and retail outlets has multiplied. Those arbiters of taste and style, the high-end gracious living catalogs, are selling bottles of expensive lavender water to spritz on your linens before you iron them. It's enough to make you wonder who is ironing all those table linens.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for those of us who yearn to be chic, but must nestle day to day in practicality's bosom, lavender (Lavendula) is wonderful. Probably the most popular lavender is Lavendula angustifolia, also known as English lavender. Its foliage, which is highly aromatic, is gray-green, and its flowers are bluish-purple. It grows in mounds and can sprout to about 3 feet tall. I have seen a glorious low hedge of English lavender growing in a strip next to an asphalt driveway. It bakes in the summer sun, doing so with remarkable good looks and incredible fragrance. If you like your lavender with a little more blue and a little less height, there is the Munstead dwarf cultivar. Munstead was, of course, the home of Gertrude Jekyll, late 19th- and early 20th-century garden designer, and patron saint of the perennial border. Lavendula angustifolia Munstead is a wonderful edging plant for a sunny site.</p>
        <p>Naturally there are some people who persist in wanting to grow lavender, but cannot abide its blue or purple coloring. For those individuals there is Lavendula angustifolia Rosea, a pink variety. It is only slightly taller than the Munstead cultivar, and thrives under the same conditions. And, since pink can also be problematic, hybridizers have come up with a white strain, Lavendula angustifolia Alba, which is available from time to time in some of the popular catalogs.</p>
        <p>Lavender is so practical and attractive that it is grown commercially in a number of places. In addition to England, the Provencal region of France is well know for lavender cultivation. If you have read Peter Mayle's books ''A Year In Provence'' or ''Toujours Provence,'' you know that he cultivated lavender throughout his chaotic home renovation project.</p>
        <p>I am especially partial to the appearance of Spanish lavender (Lavendula stoechas). This species is also sometimes known as French lavender. Whatever its nationality, it is striking in appearance, with flower heads that look a little like small pine cones with rakish topknots of upright purple petals. Spanish lavender is not reliably hardy beyond U.S.D.A. Zone 6, but might do well as a container plant that comes inside in the winter and rests in a south-facing window.</p>
        <p>All the catalogs tell you that lavender looks best planted in clumps, and that is true. Since I cannot separate lavender from roses in my mind, I plant clumps of it around my rose beds. If you are planning a bed of drought tolerant plants for a sunny part of your garden, lavender makes a wonderful edger or filler.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for those of us who would rather spritz ourselves in the summer than our bed linens, lavender is easy to gather and dry. In midsummer, when lavender is blooming, snip off the flowers with their stems. Tie the stems together, hang them upside down in a location with decent air circulation, and ignore them. They will dry out all by themselves. If you don't have time to make sachets, put the dried flower heads and leaves in a plain envelope, fold the flap inside, and put it in your linen closet. Everything will smell better and you can feel exceptionally domestic every time you need clean towels.</p>
