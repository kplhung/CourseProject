        <p>THE SETTING -- First Tuesday, a  dot-com mixer held monthly in scores of cities around the globe,  arrived last week in New York, which one organizer called ''the dot-com center of the world.'' Despite the dripping rain, about 600 prescreened participants crammed into Ohm, a restaurant-cum-nightclub at 16 West 22nd Street, in the heart of Silicon Alley.</p>
        <p>At a registration desk up front, a dozen helping hands issued laminated name badges with color-coded stickers: red for venture capitalists, green for entrepreneurs and yellow for everyone else, including service providers, lawyers and hangers-on.  The basic idea is to allow people with ideas (green) to identify people with money (red). Farther inside, past endless trays of hors d'oeuvres, attendees lingered under a mirrored disco ball, swapping business cards, talking shop and hunting for untapped e-commerce fortunes.</p>
        <p>THE BUZZ -- ''New York is a big step for us,'' said Julie Meyer, 33, who founded First Tuesday with several friends two years ago in a London bar. ''People are operating at a higher clock speed here.''</p>
        <p>Allison Britz, an associate with Easton Hunt Capital Partners, a $100 million investment fund, said, ''It reminds me of a singles party.''</p>
        <p>Even so, not all of the matchmaking was easy. ''I'm making more effort than I thought I had to,'' Ms. Britz said, proudly displaying her red sticker. ''I thought I could stand here and people would come.''</p>
        <p>Michael A. Porges, a partner with Andersen Consulting, one of the evening's corporate hosts, was unapologetic about the stratified glad-handing. ''This is the 21st century way of networking,'' he said, standing next to a television set tuned to CNBC.  ''It's part social, part business.''</p>
        <p>John Marchant, chief executive of Business360.com, was equally upfront. ''I'm talking to people so I can get money,'' he said. ''We're looking for first-round investment.''</p>
        <p>Much of the conversation centered on ''ultrahigh net worth individuals'' or ''angels,'' financial backers with more than $1 million to offer.</p>
        <p>But there was also the usual rivalry of the new economy. ''Everything is off the record,'' said Elie Poltorak, an entrepreneur with a cigar hanging from his lip. ''I don't want my competitors to learn about my idea.''</p>
        <p>First Tuesday organizers said their events, held on the first Tuesday of each month, have garnered more than $100 million in seed capital throughout Europe and South America.</p>
        <p>As the three-hour marathon ended, it was unclear whether any big deals had been struck. But Douglas Grieco, owner of a startup branding company, Take, left hopeful.</p>
        <p>''I finally made a good connection,'' he said, heading back to the office with a fresh stack of business cards.</p>
