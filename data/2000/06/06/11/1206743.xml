        <p>The terrain in Earth's corner of the cosmos has become a lot clearer. At a meeting of the American Astronomical Society, scientists described measurements of the distances to 100,000 galaxies, all lying within a few billion light years of Earth and its galaxy, the Milky Way.</p>
        <p>The galaxies revealed colossal structures the scientists likened to cosmic continents. Cosmologists were pleased to see that, just as their theories of cosmic origins predicted, the survey found these continents to have a maximum size -- a limit they call ''the end of greatness.''</p>
