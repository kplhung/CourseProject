        <p>The Boomer</p>
        <p>By Marty Asher.</p>
        <p>Knopf, $15.</p>
        <p>This slim paean to the baby boom generation builds a man out of common stereotypes: he's materialistic, superficial, molded by television, generally unsatisfied, careerist, irreligious, in therapy, a pill-popper, rich from investing, fixated on music, gently alcoholic, a lackluster exerciser, self-involved, self-indulgent -- the list goes on. ''The Boomer'' follows the arc of one man's life, from birth to burial (in a ''small, well-tended cemetery with a view of the ocean'') through the customary stops at extramarital affairs -- including, in the book's one eye-opener, a homosexual dalliance -- and a standard-issue midlife crisis. Written in short, single-paragraph chapters and illustrated with 1950's-style iconic cartoons supplied by the book designer Chip Kidd, this story feels more minimal than minimalist, as if keyed to this generation's famously short attention span, to be read during commercial breaks. What emerges is not a real character but what you might call a ''desirable adult demographic''; the protagonist is defined by his CD's (Miles Davis, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan), his cars (a familiar trajectory from blue Toyota to red Saab convertible by way of a white Volvo station wagon) and his cocktails (beer and Scotch early on, expensive margaritas later). This may all be arch, ironic parody, though the tone is straight-faced and the topics weighty -- from being a remote father to cancer tests and cremation. Perhaps this ballyhooed generation is indeed superficial, and this man its Everyman. If that's the case, a longer, complex novel isn't really necessary -- this brief sketch will do.</p>
