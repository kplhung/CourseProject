        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I would like to comment on Nancy Hass's article ''The Blockbuster Can No Longer Live by Muscle Alone'' [May 28]. She states that a film I directed, ''Wild Wild West,'' was ''a bust.'' She then goes on to state: ''Blockbuster Rule No. 1: the average number of times that teenagers see a summer blockbuster is 2.8. Repeat customers are the secret to racking up $100 million in ticket sales.'' Well, ''Wild Wild West'' must have adhered to Blockbuster Rule No. 1, since the film made over $110 million at the domestic box office, did the same overseas and, at the end of its financial life, will probably make over $400 million in all venues. ''Wild Wild West'' was not a bust.</p>

        <p>In addition, Ms. Hass states that I am looking forward to digital projection because down the road, as a blockbuster is slowing down at the box office, a filmmaker could add some additional footage to lure back teenagers for another viewing. What I had hoped to convey to Ms. Hass is that I think the studios and filmmakers will have that option in the future, but in no way did I imply that this technique was something that I had any interest in using. In fact, I have no interest in changing a film once it is done, even in a ''special edition'' DVD.</p>
        <p>Finally, anyone who goes into a film thinking they are working on a blockbuster is a fool.</p>
