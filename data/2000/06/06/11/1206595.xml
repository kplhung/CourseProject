        <p>2000 presidential race has been compared to 1960 contest, and also 1992, 1988, 1980, 1968 and even 1908 and 1928; perhaps it is the very difficulty of predicting outcome of this year's tight race that makes it so tempting to rummage through the past for a parallel of the present race; most such comparisons hinge on positioning of candidates, but other scholars look at factors such as incumbent's approval rating and voters' appetite for change; photo (M)</p>

        <p>THERE is an argument to be made that modern politics and science fiction have a great deal in common, from unusual life forms to freaky and largely inexplicable phenomena. But they are perhaps most similar in this regard: both exhibit a peculiar fascination with time travel.</p>
        <p>For example, you probably think you are watching the presidential race of 2000. Wrong. It is really 1988, or at least that is where many political scientists and Democratic strategists will transport you. They cite the familiar dynamic of a vice president (George H.W. Bush then, Al Gore now) who belonged to a successful administration and whose apparent disadvantage against a  heavily promoted governor (Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts then, George W. Bush of Texas now) turned out to be temporary.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps it is 1960, as other political scientists and Republican strategists would have you believe. The vice president (Richard M. Nixon then, Mr. Gore now) cannot trade on his administration's high regard in the face of an upbeat, arguably more charismatic challenger (John F. Kennedy then, Mr. Bush now), who ultimately prevails.</p>
        <p>Any takers for 1992? That was when the administration in power was challenged and eventually defeated by an intermittently folksy southerner (Bill Clinton then, Mr. Bush now), who was attacked as both a foreign policy know-nothing and the chief executive of a state (Arkansas then, Texas now) with abysmally low national ratings on several important issues.</p>
        <p>''Pick any year,'' conceded Allan J. Lichtman, chairman of the history department at American University, ''and you're going to find some similarities.''</p>
        <p>That is what a plethora of prognosticators are doing, to the point where the first presidential election of a new millennium is being presented as deja vu all over again.</p>
        <p>Maybe, as Mr. Lichtman theorized, it is because the 2000 presidential election hasn't proved terribly interesting so far. The economy is peachy, we're not at war and the two principal candidates have overlapping pedigrees (sons of famous politicians, graduates of prep school and the Ivy League).</p>
        <p>Or maybe the very difficulty of predicting the outcome makes rummaging through the past for a vision of the future more seductive.</p>
        <p>Whatever the cause, the practice is rampant. At a briefing for reporters in Austin, Tex., last week, Mr. Bush's advisers variously mentioned 1960, 1968, 1980 and 1988 as providing omens favorable to their candidate. One of the advisers dwelled for a bit on 1980, when Ronald Reagan defeated President Jimmy Carter, the incumbent. By this example, a Republican governor tarred by opponents as risky and extremist defeated a nationally known quantity who was regarded as perhaps a little dull and pious.</p>
        <p>Karl Rove, the Bush campaign's chief strategist, has been known to derive inspiration from as far back as 1896, when William McKinley, a Republican governor, united a divided party and reached out to new groups of voters. He was reaching out to immigrants; Mr. Bush is making his appeal to minorities.</p>
        <p>Martin P. Wattenberg, a political scientist at the University of California at Irvine, is not buying it. ''It's definitely not 1896,'' he said, ''because that was a realignment election. Although, if Bush does win big, then I guess it could be 1896.'' Then again, he added, ''1988 sounds pretty good to me.''</p>
        <p>But it does not sound good to Henry F. Graff, a retired professor of history at Columbia University who has written extensively about the American presidency.</p>
        <p>''I'd have to say 1960, when you had a vice president running against an upstart,'' said Mr. Graff, who played down 1988 for several reasons. Mr. Dukakis's period of ascendance in polls, he noted, was briefer than Mr. Bush's has been, and it came when he was less familiar to voters than Mr. Bush is now.</p>
        <p>Then there are the scholars who do not look for any one year but rather devise a timeless recipe -- a teaspoon of economic growth, a soupcon of the current president's approval rating, a dash of voters' appetite for change -- that explains and predicts the outcome of every election.</p>
        <p>''It's much more informative,'' said Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University whose mathematical model augurs a victory by Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>THAT, of course, would violate the example of 1960, but it would confirm the lessons of 1988, and maybe even 1908 and 1928, when the departing president's designated successor -- in each case, admittedly, someone  other than the vice president -- succeeded him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graff acknowledged that it is all just a guessing game, with no year exactly like any other, for an exceedingly simple reason: ''History does not repeat itself.''</p>
        <p>His scientific proof? ''These candidates running around now, in their dress-down clothing, don't look like anything in the history books.''</p>
