        <p>In this years assessment of the reading skills of fourth graders across New York State, the percentage of pupils in Westchester passing the test rose 12 points from last year, to 73.1 percent.</p>
        <p>The gains mirrored those posted statewide, where 59 percent passed the test, up 11 points from last year.</p>
        <p>Below is a list of the schools in Westchester where the test was given.</p>
        <p>Most districts posted gains overall. The most dramatic improvements occurred in Port Chester-Rye (up 28 percentage points), Yonkers (up 20 points) and Edgemont, Hendrick Hudson, New Rochelle and Yorktown (up 16 points each). The Blind Brook-Rye district showed no gain, but the district already had 91 percent of students at Bruno M. Ponteiro School meeting state standards, among the highest percentages in the county.</p>
        <p>The Greenburgh-Graham district, where no students met standards, showed a 20 point drop.</p>
        <p>The tests were given in three stages in February: reading comprehension measured through multiple-choice questions; listening comprehension judged by summaries that the pupils were asked to write, and a reading test that relied on essay responses.</p>
        <p>Educators are just beginning to assess the results, especially the strong improvement in reading skills, and many warn that with only two years' experience in the rigorous tests, it is difficult - even impossible - to discern trends.</p>
        <p>But two views were common: younger children are indeed reading more, and teachers are preparing them better to master the techniques of the tests themselves.</p>
        <p>The scores for the entire state are available on an Internet site at www.emsc.nysed.gov/irts/home.html.</p>
        <p>NUMBER TESTED The number of students who took each test.  PERFORMANCE LEVEL Percentage of students in each category. Levels are ranked from 1 (lowest) to 4. Students at Levels 1 and 2 fall below the standards, with those at Level 1 having serious deficiences. Students at Levels 3 and 4 met the standards.  PERCENTAGE MEETING STANDARDS Percentage of students who scored at Level 3 or 4.  POINT CHANGE Percentage point change from 1999 to 2000.</p>
