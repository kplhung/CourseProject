        <p>Sara Kuehl, New York City, Feb. 16, 2000</p>
        <p>''My computer is my life, whether it's at work or home. It's what I do 12 hours a day. At theknot.com, a wedding Web site, my job is to interact with a whole bunch of brides I've never had contact with before. It can be on message boards or our chat rooms or over e-mail. People talk about their moms or their bridesmaids or moving in together. It's very volatile. Part of my job is to referee. But every single day, the e-mails are basically the same. They are looking for opinions and, more often, validation. It's counseling. It's about trying to make everyone feel important. And I like being a pseudoshrink. It's strange to have a job where you feel you really make a difference and yet have it be very impersonal at the same time. I don't know them.</p>

        <p>''It was very exciting that day, with Valentine's Day. A lot of brides were writing in. I have to put myself in someone else's shoes all day long, and it's all via e-mail. It's great but really exhausting. But the first thing I do when I get home is log on.''</p>
