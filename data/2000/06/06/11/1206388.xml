        <p>ONLY one person in two million is born with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a rare genetic disorder in which bones grow uncontrollably to the point of causing devastating disability.</p>
        <p>But it only took one sufferer, 6-year-old Daniel Licht of New Rochelle, to touch the heart of Jeffrey Shuster, a 17-year-old junior at Byram Hills High School in Armonk.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shuster's mother, Lori, is Daniel's kindergarten teacher at Ward School in New Rochelle. When she took Jeffrey to meet Daniel last fall at a garage sale to benefit the International F.O.P. Association, he decided that he, too, wanted to raise money for research to combat the disease.</p>
        <p>The result: a fund-raiser with upscale prizes, which were given out last Tuesday, at an ice cream party at Byram Hills High School. The event raised $3,500.</p>
        <p>For the last several months, Jeffrey and members of the high school's chapter of Interact, a national service organization, have been selling pin-on buttons adorned with photographs of Daniel and the words ''Do it for Daniel and others with F.O.P.'' One button was $5, and with it came a chance at tickets to an In Sync concert and box seats to a Yankees game.</p>
        <p>''I think because the disease is so rare, I actually got people's attention,'' Jeffrey said. At his request, Jeri Licht, Daniel's mother, visited Interact members at the school and took objects that enable her son to do everyday things like lift food to his mouth: a special pair of footlong plastic tongs and an equally long spoon with a flexible handle.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Licht also showed the group a little cutout of a palm and fingers attached to a yardstick. This is what Daniel, who has severely limited mobility in his arms, uses when he wants to raise his hand in class. ''Seeing these things really made people connect to Daniel and his problems,'' Jeffrey said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Licht, a lawyer who stopped practicing to devote herself full time to her son, is adamant about the need to support research for rare, life-threatening conditions. After several years of grueling tests, misdiagnoses and futile treatments, Daniel's condition was finally diagnosed correctly in 1997 by Dr. Fred Kaplan, a metabolic bone disease specialist at the hospital at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. At that time Mrs. Licht became active in the International F.O.P. Association; last fall, she raised $14,000 at the garage sale at her home where Daniel and Jeffrey met.</p>
        <p>Money she raises goes toward research. Currently, she said, medical professionals are trying to ''turn off the genetic switch'' that regulates bone growth and trying to stop those bony growths once they have started by cutting off their blood supply and using certain drugs.</p>
        <p>She said that while the specifics differ, studying these biological processes could yield clues to the nature of other, more common diseases, like cancer, which also involves overgrowth of tissue, and osteoporosis. ''F.O.P. may affect one in two million,'' Mrs. Licht said, ''but F.O.P. research could benefit millions.''</p>
