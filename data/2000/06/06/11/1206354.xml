        <p>Q Does a co-op board have the right to limit the percent of financing that buyers of sponsor units are allowed to obtain? . . . Lewis Hadow, the Bronx.</p>

        <p>Q Does a co-op board have the right to limit the percent of financing that buyers of sponsor units are allowed to obtain? . . . Lewis Hadow, the Bronx.</p>
        <p>A Stuart M. Saft, a Manhattan lawyer who is chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that while most proprietary leases give a sponsor the right to sell unsold units to whomever he pleases without board approval, the board may be able to control the percentage of financing that a sponsor's purchaser may obtain, if the building has a consistent policy on the issue.</p>
        <p>That is because most co-op lenders require that the co-op corporation, through its board, enter into what is known as a recognition agreement with the lender before the lender will make a loan. Such an agreement, Mr. Saft said, provides the lender with the assurance that the co-op will not terminate the shareholder's proprietary lease without first notifying the lender.</p>
        <p>And since most proprietary leases do not contain a specific provision requiring a board to execute a recognition agreement for sponsor sales, the board would have the power to decline to do so.</p>
        <p>''If the board is not obligated to execute the recognition agreement, even for a sale by a sponsor, it can establish the conditions that must be met for it to do so,'' Mr. Saft said, explaining that one condition might be a limitation on the percentage of financing a purchaser could obtain.</p>
        <p>''Such decisions by the board, as long as they are consistently applied to all shareholders, are generally not subject to review by the courts,'' Mr. Saft said. He added, however, that a sponsor could undercut the board's power by providing financing not conditioned on a recognition agreement.</p>
        <p>Party Wall: Concrete Or Sheetrock?</p>
        <p>Q In September 1999 I bought a newly constructed three-family home in Queens. On inspecting the plans given me by the builder with the certificate of occupancy, I observed that the party wall separating my house from the one next door is supposed to be concrete. In fact, the wall is sheetrock. Is this legal? I was told that if I report this to the Buildings Department they can give me a violation. . . . Lester Haynes, Queens Village.</p>
        <p>A Richard Moss, a Brooklyn architect, said that to be in compliance with the New York City Building Code, a party wall of an attached three-family is ordinarily constructed of concrete block, unless special permission for a different wall has been granted by the Department of Buildings.</p>
        <p>Since the plans indicate a concrete wall, however, there would seem to be no reason for the department to have issued permission for any other type of wall. Accordingly, Mr. Moss said, the first thing the letter writer should do is determine whether a concrete wall is under the sheetrock.  If not, the letter writer should determine whether the department approved an amendment to the original plans allowing the wall to be constructed as it is.</p>
        <p>Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the Buildings Department, said that if the letter writer reports the matter to the department, it could indeed issue a violation against him as the owner. The department could require him to take whatever steps necessary to bring the wall into compliance with the code or to obtain retroactive permission for the existing wall.</p>
        <p>At the same time, she said, the department could fine or suspend the privileges of the architect or engineer who certified that the construction was in compliance with the code.</p>
        <p>John G. Hall, a Staten Island real estate lawyer, said that the letter writer's primary recourse would be to sue the builder. ''If the plans or model referred to in the contract included a concrete party wall, the buyer would be entitled to it,'' he said, adding that included in the letter writer's damages would be any costs incurred in replacing the existing wall or getting it approved as constructed.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, Mr. Hall said, if the letter writer received a homeowners warranty from the builder, he could make a claim under it.</p>
