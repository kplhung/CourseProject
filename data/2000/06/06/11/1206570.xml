        <p>COMPARISONS can be overdrawn between the proposed breakup of Microsoft and the dismemberment almost 20 years ago of AT&amp;T. But veterans of the Bell System's split see at least one clear parallel: the sense of denial within AT&amp;T was as strong then as it appears to be at Microsoft now.</p>
        <p>Harold W. Burlingame, an AT&amp;T employee since 1962 and now executive vice president of AT&amp;T Wireless, was part of the phone company's breakup team in the early 1980's. Burke Stinson, who joined AT&amp;T in 1969 and is now a manager in its public relations department, was in a lower-level public relations job at the time.</p>
        <p>Both men recall widespread disbelief that a breakup was inevitable -- and fear and anger when it happened as planned under an agreement with the government.</p>
        <p>''Instead of preparing for the future, people waited for a hue and cry from Main Street to force Washington to change its mind,'' Mr. Stinson recalled. ''What Washington understood, and AT&amp;T in its hubris didn't, was that the American public likes underdogs and competition and will vote to bring down any company it sees as too big for its britches.''</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T's management took the obligatory calming steps. It protected pension plans and ensured that each newly independent company -- a long-distance carrier and seven local phone companies -- would start out with a strong set of assets and a viable balance sheet.</p>
        <p>But management could not effectively dispute the obvious: some careers would be enhanced by the breakup, but many would be truncated.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T had routinely rotated up-and-comers from the local phone companies through staff jobs at headquarters, with an eye toward grooming them for future management anywhere in the company. The breakup prevented the easy flow of people back and forth, forcing managers to choose their futures early on.</p>
        <p>Many of the company's fast-tracked middle managers, including Mr. Burlingame, decided to stay at headquarters. ''I felt the new AT&amp;T would be an international business that would grow,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For many, that belief escalated into condescension for those who joined the so-called Baby Bells.</p>
        <p>''People who stayed at headquarters called the others 'Bell heads,' a pejorative term for people whose thinking was more traditional than adventuresome,'' Mr. Stinson said. ''Their sense of what AT&amp;T itself would become was steeped more in marketing promise than reality.''</p>
        <p>Instead, AT&amp;T's unsuccessful attempts to move into computers and complex communications systems sent the company into a tailspin, prompting huge job cuts. And as competitors piled into its former monopoly markets, the criteria for success at the company were upended, leaving once-promising managers out on the street.</p>
        <p>Like Microsoft facing the post-PC era, the new AT&amp;T found itself in an environment unlike the one in which it had drawn the government's ire.</p>
        <p>''We would probably have had to change anyway,'' Mr. Burlingame said, ''but the breakup really accelerated the process.''</p>
