        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Which Man's Army'' (''How Race Is Lived in America,'' front page, June 7):</p>
        <p>I am an Army veteran who spent three years at Fort Knox, Ky., from 1953 to 1956. I am black (born and raised in Chicago), and to put it mildly, my experience at Fort Knox was a shock.</p>
        <p>I had all the usual experiences one would expect at that time in the South, but I think the one experience that says a great deal about race relations in America has stayed with me: on the day of my induction, I met a man whose personal profile was as different from mine as night from day. He was white, from a rural community in Illinois, a farmer all of his life with no black acquaintances.</p>
        <p>From the moment we met at the induction center, we became inseparable! In Louisville, I was humiliated several times -- thrown out of the ''white'' waiting rooms, not allowed to go to first-run movie theaters, and so on. No one was more outraged than my friend.</p>
        <p>So, one of my best friends in life was white: at a time when we were both isolated from our respective cultures, we found one another and believed enough in one another to have a memorable, trusting experience together.</p>
