        <p>Carl Everett is not playing at Yankee Stadium this weekend. Neither is J. T. Snow, Eric Milton, Tony Armas Jr., Preston Wilson, Quilvio Veras, Fernando Vina nor Jeromy Burnitz. Al Leiter is, but only after taking a circuitous route to get there.</p>
        <p>Except for Leiter, those players and many others are playing not for the Yankees or the Mets this weekend but for other teams in other interleague series. Once upon a time they began their professional baseball lives in the Yankees' or Mets' minor league system, but they have been moved elsewhere, many before getting a chance to play for the Yankees or the Mets.</p>
        <p>Consider this team of players the Yankees raised but did not keep: first basemen Fred McGriff (Devil Rays) and Snow (Giants); second basemen Andy Fox (Marlins) and Kevin Jordan (Phillies); shortstop Cristian Guzman (Twins); third basemen Mike Lowell (Marlins) and Russ Davis (Giants); outfielders Everett (Red Sox), Gerald Williams (Devil Rays), Ruben Rivera (Padres); catchers Brad Ausmus (Tigers) and Brian Johnson (Royals); and pitchers Leiter, Milton (Twins), Armas (Expos), Sterling Hitchcock (Padres) and Hideki Irabu (Expos).</p>
        <p>Among players the Mets have spawned and disgorged are a pair of starting second basemen, Vina (Cardinals) and Veras (Braves); two closers, Rick Aguilera (Cubs) and Jason Isringhausen (Athletics); a pretty good outfield of Jeromy Burnitz (Brewers), Preston Wilson (Marlins) and Terrence Long (Athletics); and a first baseman, Brian Daubach, who will be at Yankee Stadium tomorrow with Everett when the Red Sox arrive for a three-game series.</p>
        <p>Everett's story is well known, especially the part about his dislike for the Yankees, who drafted him in the first round of the 1990 draft and then left him exposed for Florida to take in the 1992 expansion draft.</p>
        <p>A member of the organization who was there said the word to leave Everett unprotected came from Joseph Molloy, then the Yankees' managing partner and George Steinbrenner's son-in-law. Molloy is no longer either, and Everett may be the American League most valuable player this season.</p>
        <p>Daubach left the Mets' organization as a minor league free agent in 1996 and signed with the Marlins, for whom he played in 1998 before they released him. The Marlins did not keep Everett long either. He played 16 games for them in 1994 before they traded him to the Mets for Veras, who had spent five years with Mets minor league teams.</p>
        <p>The Mets signed Veras as an amateur free agent six months before they drafted Vina in June 1990. They traded Vina to Milwaukee in 1994, a month after they traded Veras to the Marlins.</p>
        <p>The Mets made trades 10 years apart that created closers for other teams. In 1989, they included Aguilera in a package they sent to Minnesota for Frank Viola, and last year they traded Isringhausen to Oakland for Billy Taylor. Aguilera has earned 292 saves with the Twins and the Chicago Cubs; Isringhausen is off to an effective start with the Athletics with 14 saves.</p>
        <p>The Mets made another trade with Oakland last year, acquiring Kenny Rogers, and one of the players in the deal, Long, has become the A's center fielder. But the Mets have traded no young player who has developed and produced more than Burnitz, who hit 98 home runs in three seasons for the Brewers after they acquired him from Cleveland, which got him from the Mets.</p>
        <p>Wilson has been productive with the Marlins, who obtained him from the Mets in the Mike Piazza deal. Piazza's presence prompted the Mets to trade Todd Hundley, a home-grown catcher, to Los Angeles, where he has been joined by the former Mets shortstop Kevin Elster.</p>
        <p>The Yankees lost two catchers in drafts -- Brad Ausmus to Colorado in the 1992 expansion draft and Brian Johnson to San Diego in the 1991 minor league draft. Both have since moved to other teams. Alberto Castillo was a catcher in the Mets' system for 12 years before he left as a free agent in 1998. He is now with Toronto.</p>
        <p>Not all players become starters after leaving the Mets or Yankees. The Yankees had three players who have become steady part-time players -- Jordan with the Phillies, Lyle Mouton with the Brewers and Turner Ward now with Arizona.</p>
        <p>The Mets had, among others, Aaron Ledesma (Rockies), Butch Huskey (Twins) and Gregg Jefferies (Tigers).</p>
        <p>Of more recent vintage, the Yankees traded four players to Minnesota for Chuck Knoblauch, and three of them start for the Twins: Milton, their No. 2 starting pitcher; Guzman, their shortstop, and Brian Buchanan, who was recently promoted from the minors to play right field.</p>
        <p>Armas, whom the Yankees traded to the Red Sox so they could have Mike Stanley for the last six weeks of the 1997 season, recently joined Montreal's starting rotation. After nine years in the minors, all with the Yankees, Bubba Carpenter became a major league rookie with Colorado last month and has hit three home runs in 27 at-bats.</p>
        <p>According to an annual study done by Tracy Ringolsby of The Rocky Mountain News in Denver, the Yankees and the Mets last year were among the top five teams in the number of players from their systems playing in the majors for other teams: Montreal 40, Los Angeles 39, Mets 38, and Yankees and Toronto 36 each.</p>
        <p>Sosa Trade Is Likely</p>
        <p>The likelihood is growing that the Chicago Cubs will trade Sammy Sosa sometime this season. His feud with the Cubs' manager, Don Baylor, will not be the reason, but Sosa's public reaction to comments Baylor had made about him has sparked internal discussion about Sosa's future with the team and the direction the Cubs want to take.</p>
        <p>Andy MacPhail, the Cubs' president, said last week the team had no plans to trade the home run-hitting right fielder, but he left open the possibility by saying, ''Clearly, it's not something that has a lot of appeal to me at the present time.'' The nonwaiver trading deadline, July 31, is not ''the present time.''</p>
        <p>The Cubs have begun a process of deciding where they want to go. Will they be better off in the next five years or so with Sosa (assuming he agrees to a contract extension) or with the four or five players they could command from another team?</p>
        <p>Sosa, who has one guaranteed year left on his contract after this one, has the right to veto a trade, but if the Cubs decide they want to make a move, he will very likely not stand in their way.</p>
        <p>If they make that decision, the Cubs are expected to tell interested teams what they would want for Sosa. Those talks could be the highlight of the summer.</p>
        <p>Rocker Going Elsewhere</p>
        <p>Baseball people who have talked to Atlanta Braves officials do not expect John Rocker to return to the Braves. The front office and his teammates, they feel, have had enough.</p>
        <p>The question then is which teams would be willing to take on the volatility and attention that Rocker would bring with him. Assuming he can straighten out his control problems in his stay at Richmond, one or more teams should have interest.</p>
        <p>Interleague Sweeps</p>
        <p>Not everyone likes interleague play, and the first series of games this season has given some teams reason to dislike it.</p>
        <p>The Boston Red Sox had not been swept in a series in the first two months of the season. Then they played the Philadelphia Phillies, the team with the worst record in the National League and no series sweeps. The Phillies won all three.</p>
        <p>The Chicago White Sox have a far better record than the Phillies; in fact, they had the best record in the American League when they played the Cincinnati Reds. But the Reds led their division and had suffered only one sweep before they played the White Sox and lost all three games.</p>
        <p>Other interleague sweeps: Montreal against Baltimore, Cincinnati against Minnesota, Cleveland against Milwaukee, Oakland against San Diego.</p>
        <p>Orioles 0 for Canada</p>
        <p>Members of the Baltimore Orioles will not be making any vacation visits to Canada any time soon. In fact, the Orioles should be excused if they ask out of their next scheduled trip there July 21-23.</p>
        <p>In one of the more bizarre streaks of recent seasons, the Orioles have lost 20 consecutive games in Canada, 14 to the Toronto Blue Jays and six to the Montreal Expos, whom they have never beaten in Canada. The last time the Orioles won north of the border was June 12, 1998. They beat the Blue Jays that day, 9-5.</p>
        <p>Zuckert's Legacy</p>
        <p>Eugene Zuckert, who was the secretary of the Air Force under President Kennedy, died last Monday. No mention of baseball appeared in his obituary because he had no connection to the game. However, his name will live in baseball lore for the association he did not have with the game.</p>
        <p>When Major League Baseball owners set out to seek a new commissioner in 1965 before the retirement of Ford Frick, John Fetzer of Detroit and John Galbreath of Pittsburgh, co-chairmen of the search committee, identified a man connected with the military as a potentially good candidate. The man they were said to have in mind was Zuckert, but somehow the owners wound up interviewing -- and hiring -- William Eckert, an Air Force general known as Spike.</p>
        <p>Three years into his term, Eckert was forced to resign. Not only did he lack knowledge about the game he was running, but he also was a public relations disaster.</p>
        <p>There has been some question about whether there was really a Zuckert-Eckert mixup, but a former club owner recalled asking Fetzer about the matter and said the Tigers owner ducked a direct answer. He quoted Fetzer as saying, ''Well, that isn't exactly right.'' But neither he nor Galbreath, the former owner said, wanted to talk about it.</p>
        <p>''There's enough anecdotal evidence,'' the former owner said. ''I believe it's true.''</p>
