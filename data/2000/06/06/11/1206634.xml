        <p>Imagine that skull with its fierce angles and sniper's eyes rising from the mists of the great Northwest and returning to us, again giving courage to those who have lost heart, again chilling the souls of those who would dare challenge the Blue. Call him Captain Dad, Mark Messiah, the Frozen Chosen, but as the grandstand Beast knows, only he can justify its cry, ''We want cup!''</p>
        <p>I am breathless at my own insanity. Who cares about hockey? The Devils can win the Stanley Cup and the radio nutkins will still argue whether the Knicks are better or worse with Patrick Ewing. But this isn't about hockey. This isn't about The Big Man or The Franchise Player or even about The Team Leader or The Role Model. This is about New York's last legendary hero since Mickey Mantle.</p>

        <p>Imagine that skull with its fierce angles and sniper's eyes rising from the mists of the great Northwest and returning to us, again giving courage to those who have lost heart, again chilling the souls of those who would dare challenge the Blue. Call him Captain Dad, Mark Messiah, the Frozen Chosen, but as the grandstand Beast knows, only he can justify its cry, ''We want cup!''</p>
        <p>I am breathless at my own insanity. Who cares about hockey? The Devils can win the Stanley Cup and the radio nutkins will still argue whether the Knicks are better or worse with Patrick Ewing. But this isn't about hockey. This isn't about The Big Man or The Franchise Player or even about The Team Leader or The Role Model. This is about New York's last legendary hero since Mickey Mantle.</p>
        <p>Mark Messier has never been a manufactured commodity; he is too weird looking, too unexpected, too committed to his game. You believe him when he says he has avoided long-term emotional attachments to keep his edge.</p>
        <p>There seem to be dark, secret folds in his life. One imagines him capable of the unspeakable, and then keeping his mouth shut about it. When he giggles -- and he does -- it is easy to believe he is receiving a joke from a parallel universe. And he is smart, direct, a grown-up.</p>
        <p>If the Rangers do not bring him back for next season, follow my lead and ignore hockey forever. Send acceptances only to thelipsite@aol.com.</p>
        <p>Instead of watching the Rangers, we will read books not recommended by Phil Jackson. The first should be Seamus Heaney's new translation of Beowulf. We know whom it is really about, a ''man whose name was known for courage resolute in his helmet,'' a man whose world was ''honour-bound and blood-stained,'' who came from his native land pitying ''the plight you suffer in this legendary hall.'' You can figure out who were ''the reavers from hell,'' the opposing hockey players disguised as Grendel and Grendel's Mother that Messier slew in exchange for a great deal of money and power.</p>
        <p>Like Beowulf, Messier had come across a border from his native country where he had won battles but never quite achieved the fame his vanity demanded. But he had honed his steel at home.</p>
        <p>''Edmonton was the psychological boot camp,'' he told me a year after the Rangers won cup. ''Endless seminars on how to find your superconscious, the zone. It sounds like insanity. Except how do you explain those nights when I'm so focused that I fly, never feel my legs, no pain, see everything, score three goals?</p>
        <p>''I was 18 when I joined the team; we were all young together. The Islanders were our role models and then we beat them. It was a wonderful time, but it was a relationship that had run its course. I needed to leave Edmonton.''</p>
        <p>And now, Edmonton has come to New York and beckons to him to return. Messier is pushing 40, like Beowulf in honored twilight, waiting for one more monster to slay. Messier's hockey father, Glen Sather, who led Edmonton to five Stanley Cups in the 1980's (he had Wayne Gretzky for four of them), was named the Rangers' president and general manager last week.</p>
        <p>The myth expands: the heart of that 1994 Ranger championship team -- goalie Mike Richter, defenseman Brian Leetch and Adam Graves, the wing who guarded Messier's back in Edmonton as well as New York -- is still in place, pining for leadership.</p>
        <p>And there is more. After the cup year, when the mad coach who had driven them, Mike Keenan, left ugly, Messier took over the team from a weak coach. Messier took a dislike to Petr Nedved, a brilliant young Czech center, one of the many European finesse players then coming into the league. They were disdained by the Canadian hard cases as soft ''snow blowers'' who would pull up in a spray of ice rather than risk collision. Messier ran him off the Rangers.</p>
        <p>Nedved is now back, the premier center. Can you imagine these two finding common ice, bonding?</p>
        <p>If this doesn't rouse your blood, it may be our fault after all. We have confused stars and heroes, pumped up that brown Barney, Shaquille O'Neal, and proclaimed him the future face of sport.</p>
        <p>We have railed at John Rocker for expressing opinions we tolerate from the drive-time schlock jocks who invite journalists on their air. It seemed fitting that Rocker was ''sent down'' (to the minors or the reavers from hell) after he verbally threatened the reporter who had originally given him his megaphone. If only Messier also had the time to start a men's therapy group and include Rocker and Bob Knight, clueless or hanging tough, but still working.</p>
        <p>On July 1, Captain Dad's Vancouver contract expires. We need our centered center with his rage to win. Who else could say, unselfconsciously: ''When you put on the sweater, everything should become crystal clear. You know what you have to do for the team.''</p>
        <p>And, like Beowulf, he will kill that last dragon and then expire from his wounds. Captain Dad will also get a hero's send-off because, as Heaney writes of Beowulf, ''He was the man most gracious and fair-minded, kindest to his people and keenest to win fame.''</p>
