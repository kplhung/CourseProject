        <p>WHEN I was a teenager, I remember standing on the sidewalk with my friend Debi, who made a joke about something bringing down the property values in our neighborhood. The stunning part was that I didn't know what ''property values'' meant.</p>
        <p>Come to think of it, I was also perplexed by the term ''mortgage'' in Monopoly.</p>
        <p>Now, of course, as a card-carrying member of the bourgeoisie, I even know what ''escrow'' means. So I take an interest in seeing lawns mowed and streets cleaned. And though I have no plans to move, my heart leaps when I hear what houses around me are selling for.</p>
        <p>Which is why, as a responsible citizen, I know we should take a hard stand against graffiti.</p>
        <p>The subject came up a few weeks ago at a council meeting in my town, which is planning to spend about $5,000 to eliminate a few scrawls, and to paint our field houses with graffiti-resistant silicone. But the graffiti issue is hardly unique to Glen Ridge. In neighboring Bloomfield, the recreation department has a zero-tolerance policy on graffiti, removing it within 24 hours.</p>
        <p>''That has really deterred people who are tagging,'' said Leonard Celluro, Bloomfield's director of recreation, who instituted the policy. ''People who want to tag are stating their claim to that area. Our resources will probably outlast theirs.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Celluro and Bloomfield appear to be winning the war on graffiti -- or ''tagging,'' as it's known. Cruise through town looking for the stuff and you'll come up almost empty-handed. Same for most of Glen Ridge, Montclair and Nutley.</p>
        <p>Under bridges, though, is another story. Graffiti sprouts like mushrooms after a rain. Walk under a bridge in the most picturesque suburban town and you'll find a scene worthy of the Cross Bronx or Brooklyn-Queens Expressways. I decided to explore a few local underpasses with Ed Talmo, president of Enviro-Northeast Sales Corp. in Highland Lakes. Mr. Talmo has 10 years fighting graffiti, and goes after it the way Batman pursues the Riddler.</p>
        <p>''At times when I'm driving and I see a major tag, I stop, put some biodegradable cleaner on it, and let it drip,'' he said with a malevolent grin.</p>
        <p>Under one bridge in my town, Mr. Talmo and I found several walls of graffiti -- along with a mattress, empty six-packs, broken glass, countless cigarette butts and a putrid smell that would never be tolerated 20 feet above. And this underpass was clearly owned by a graffiti writer called Neck, whose most recent tag was a star-spangled confection bearing the words ''Made in the USA by Neck.''</p>
        <p>''Neck is honing his skills,'' Mr. Talmo said, shaking his head sadly.</p>
        <p>Later, under a bridge in Wright's Field in Bloomfield, we found a similar scene, but with different names.</p>
        <p>I can't say these were pretty places. They smelled awful and were, in fact, a repudiation of the suburban ideal above. On the other hand, these underground galleries aren't exactly blighting the landscape; you have to go looking for them. And clearly, there is some art to it: Neck could design Web sites for a living. Indeed, a quick Internet search found dozens of interlinked graffiti pages, with photographs, featured artists -- even graffiti-decorated T-shirts for $19.</p>
        <p>I slept on all this for a couple of days, not sure what I thought. And then, waking up from a particularly colorful nightmare one morning, it occurred to me. These areas under our suburban bridges are our unconscious -- our subterranean, suburban id. And no amount of biodegradable cleaner will ever eliminate them.</p>
        <p>No number of historic landmark commissions or public works departments can completely deter teenagers with spray cans in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>That's when I remembered ''Pleasantville,'' the 1998 movie by Gary Ross in which two kids are thrown back to an idealized 1950's black-and-white world where it never rains, and the fire department exists only to rescue cats in trees. The film's trick is that you start out longing for all this sweetness, but begin to realize how suffocating it is.</p>
        <p>When the town fathers declare that ''the only permissable paint colors shall be black, white and gray,'' you root for the characters who paint a wickedly colorful mural on the side of the town's police building.</p>
        <p>''I know you want it to stay pleasant around here, but there are so many things that are so much better,''' says the unlikely hero, Bud, in a climactic courtroom scene. ''Like silly. Or sexy. Or dangerous . . . ''</p>
