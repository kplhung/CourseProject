        <p>John Ray's computer sits on a gurney beside his bed in the V.A. Medical Center in Decatur, Ga. The computer is an old Dell Pentium whose mouse, monitor and keyboard rest out of Ray's reach. Which is fine, because Ray, or Johnny, as everyone calls him, doesn't have much use for them. He can move the cursor across the screen simply by thinking about it.</p>
        <p>In December 1997, Johnny, a veteran of three tours in Vietnam, was working as a drywall contractor in Douglasville, Ga., and playing guitar with a country-and-western band. One night, while talking with one of his stepchildren on the phone, he collapsed in the throes of a brain-stem stroke.</p>
        <p>The brain stem is the main pathway between the brain and the spinal cord, the route by which the mind exerts control over the muscles. While Johnny's cognitive functions escaped serious damage, the orders coming from his brain were effectively cut off from the rest of his body. Johnny entered a state doctors refer to as ''locked in'': he is able to think, reason and comprehend what is going on around him, but unable to talk, touch or even breathe without the aid of a tracheotomy tube. ''It's like an ice storm that knocks out all the telephone poles and pulls the wires out of your house,'' says Dr. Roy Bakay, a neurosurgeon at Emory University. ''You can't communicate with the outside world. The only difference is that there is no way to repair this wire.''</p>
        <p>In a sense, Dr. Philip Kennedy, a neurologist at Emory, has figured out a way to lay new wire. In 1996, Kennedy received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to implant electrodes directly into a patient's brain in order to create what is called a ''brain to computer interface.'' One condition of the approval was that only subjects who were ''locked in,'' or in the words of Bakay, were ''as close as you can get to death without actually dying,'' be selected for the procedure.</p>
        <p>Johnny received his implants in March 1998. During a 12-hour operation, Bakay inserted the electrodes, housed in two glass cones, into the area of Johnny's cortex that controls left-hand movement. Once the cones were implanted, the doctors believed that axons -- parts of the brain cell that transmit electrical impulses -- would grow through them. When an impulse passed along an axon, it would be intercepted by tiny gold contacts and transmitted through the electrodes. ''Axons are really like telephone lines,'' Kennedy explains. ''We're just diverting the lines and eavesdropping on the call.''</p>
        <p>The hope was that by imagining he was moving his paralyzed left hand, Johnny would cause an increase in electrical impulses passing among the neurons there. These impulses could then be transmitted by the implanted electrodes to a receiver placed on Johnny's pillow, and from there, the analog brain signals could be translated into digital commands that Johnny's computer could understand. In theory, by controlling the frequency with which the neurons in his motor cortex fire, Johnny could move a cursor up or down, left or right on his screen.</p>
        <p>Johnny first tried to use a program called TalkAssist, which consists of about a dozen icons, each representing different words and phrases like ''help,'' ''pain'' and ''I'm uncomfortable.'' Watching the screen, he concentrated on the imagined movement of his hand, nudging the cursor unsteadily toward the icons. When the cursor struck an icon, a voice synthesizer broadcast his request. While crude, TalkAssist allowed Johnny to at least initiate conversations and to communicate discomfort, instead of having to wait for a doctor or nurse to discover the problem.</p>
        <p>The next challenge was a keyboard program that allows him to spell words on the screen. Because Johnny had very limited ability to flex his left shoulder muscle, Kennedy attached a small muscle sensor to act as a kind of mouse click. Johnny could move the cursor onto the correct letter with his brain, then flex his shoulder to ''click'' on it.</p>
        <p>Johnny's team asked him to practice by spelling his own name, but the program didn't allow him to correct mistakes, and he grew increasingly frustrated. ''The original didn't have a backspace,'' says Melody Moore, a professor of computer information systems at Georgia State University who has worked with Johnny several days a week for the past two years. ''Once we put one in, he got much, much better in just a few sessions.''</p>
        <p>After months of struggling to move the cursor from letter to letter, he finally spelled out JOHN. The doctors, thrilled at this achievement, asked him to do it again. He painstakingly spelled out PHIL, just to be funny.</p>
        <p>Over the next few months, Johnny improved his typing speed to about three characters a minute, a figure the team hopes will increase to 30 characters per minute. But that improvement, they say, has to come from computer scientists' creating software that understands his signals better and building an interface that he can manipulate more easily.</p>
        <p>There have been some unexpected developments. After several months, the doctors noticed that Johnny was moving his lips in concert with the cursor. When they asked him about this, he was able to communicate that the locus of imagined movement seemed to be shifting, moving up toward his face. Because of his paralysis, the function of the cells in Johnny's brain that control his limbs -- in this case, his left hand and arm -- had been slowly usurped by the cells adjacent to it.</p>
        <p>To Johnny, moving the cursor began to feel as if he were arching or squeezing his eyebrow rather than manipulating his hand. In order to get Johnny to separate the actual movement of his eyebrows from the imagined movement that would produce neural signals and control the cursor, Kennedy attached a sensor to his brow and wired it through the computer. Johnny repeatedly practiced moving the cursor on the screen between two horizontal bars, like a toddler learning to color within the lines.</p>
        <p>When he was able to manipulate the cursor cleanly, the team asked him what he felt as he did it. Johnny typed NOTHING. What this meant to the doctors was that Johnny was skipping the intermediary step of imagining moving a part of his body; now he thought simply about moving the cursor, and it moved. For Johnny, it meant the cursor was beginning to feel like a part of him, a new limb. Moving the cursor, he said, felt like ''pushing against a wall.'' ''As you can imagine,'' Moore says, ''that was a pretty good day for all of us.''</p>
        <p>There have also been bad days. Last year, Johnny began developing cataracts and painful filaments in both eyes. For most of this year, he has been almost completely blind, unable to see his computer screen and therefore unable to communicate except by blinking to yes-or-no questions. After experiencing real, if painstaking, contact with the world around him, the cataracts had banished him again to the state of being locked in.</p>
        <p>Kennedy and Moore tried to overcome the problem by developing an auditory program that Johnny can operate without having to see the screen. Because he played the guitar for so many years, music is the idiom of their new program. They tested the program for the first time during a recent afternoon session at the hospital.</p>
        <p>As he lay in bed, his head propped by an inflatable pillow, Johnny's eyes seemed unusually alert, scanning the room and greeting any new visitors. There was a pile of books for the nurses to read to him, and a sign on the television reminded them to turn on all the baseball and football games.</p>
        <p>As she adjusted the antenna under Johnny's pillow, Moore constantly asked him questions and waited for him to blink his responses -- two for yes, one for no. Johnny usually insists on working even when he is in pain from his eyes or bedsores. (Like many brain-stem stroke patients, he retains almost full sensation in his body.)</p>
        <p>On Johnny's computer screen, the notes in the diatonic scale, C through B, were arranged in four rows, each row representing an octave. To power the transmitter in Johnny's brain, which has no internal battery, Moore placed a power coil against his scalp. ''Now, concentrate, Johnny,'' she said. ''Try to move the cursor up the scale.'' At first, there was little variation in the lines on the oscilloscope that displays Johnny's brain waves. But as his concentration intensified, spikes appeared, indicating frequency, and grew higher, indicating amplitude. Moore whistled when she saw the height of the waves. ''He can get those things off the screen when he gets going,'' she said then.</p>
        <p>The cursor moved diagonally at first, but Johnny soon righted it. When it cleanly touched a square, the note played through the computer speaker. The notes were clear, if a little out of tune (Moore recorded them from a 100-year-old family piano), and after a few minutes, Johnny could slide slowly but cleanly up the scales and down through the octaves.</p>
        <p>As Johnny tired and began to wince, Moore decided to cut the session short. She smoothed his blond hair back and asked him to rate his pain on a scale from 1 to 10. He didn't blink until she reached 10. ''He's the toughest guy I have ever known,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Since human brain waves were first recorded in 1929, scientists and sci-fi writers have been fascinated by the prospect of the mind controlling external objects without the intermediation of the body. (Writers like William Gibson, for instance, created heroes who were ''jacked in,'' able to send and receive digital signals by wiring their own brains directly to hard drives.) But it wasn't until the dawn of the personal computer in the 1970's and advances in the 1990's that brain-to-computer interfaces became plausible.</p>
        <p>Kennedy groans at some of the more speculative applications of brain-to-computer interfaces. ''I can operate a computer fine with my hands,'' he says. The objectives of his implant program are both more modest and far more profound. The first, proved at least possible by Johnny, is to establish new lines of communication with locked-in patients. The second is to help patients like Johnny (who is typing now thanks to a cataract operation) regain some control over their immediate environment -- to do things like switch their lights on and off, control the temperature in their room, even turn on a baseball game on their own.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the doctors hope their research will allow locked-in patients to connect not just with computers but also with their own bodies again. Some patients in other research projects have had limited success controlling paralyzed limbs through the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. A second set of electrodes, implanted in their lifeless muscles, acts as a sort of electrically charged prosthesis by receiving commands from EEG waves and stimulating the muscles to create simple movements.</p>
        <p>Kennedy and Bakay think the cortical implants may give locked-in patients a chance for significantly more mobility. In the two years since Johnny received his implant, he developed a far greater degree of control over his motor cortex than is possible through the EEG method. ''You can control waves with EEG activity,'' Bakay says, ''but you can't get refined signals. John can. That would give you more control for prosthetic devices.''</p>
        <p>If the implants could work with muscle stimulation, the computer would be like a surrogate brain stem, a second line of communication to paralyzed limbs. ''People worry that this is, in effect, the machine taking over the human,'' Bakay says. ''In fact, it's quite the opposite.'' For Johnny Ray, the imagined movement of a cursor across a screen could one day lead to the feeling of his own hand pushing against a wall.</p>
