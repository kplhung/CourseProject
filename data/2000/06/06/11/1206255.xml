        <p>WHAT I THINK I DID</p>
        <p>A Season of Survival in Two Acts.</p>
        <p>By Larry Woiwode.</p>
        <p>313 pp. New York: Basic Books. $25.</p>
        <p>IN 1978, the novelist Larry Woiwode withdrew with his family from the carnival of ordinary American life -- the noise, the strip malls, the induced ''fun,'' the perpetual Punch-and-Judy show of television -- and moved to a 160-acre farm in his native state of North Dakota. He'd already become a familiar if mysterious name to readers of The New Yorker's short fiction: L. Woiwode. And he'd seen the publication of his first two novels, the highly praised ''What I'm Going to Do, I Think'' and ''Behind the Bedroom Wall,'' the latter still very much in print after 25 years. Those who think Woiwode's career went into decline after that heady early success ought to read his new memoir, ''What I Think I Did,'' which has one leg in the literary, artistic and theatrical whirlwind of 1960's New York and the other in North Dakota during a monster blizzard in the winter of 1996, the most severe on record. He has never written better.</p>
        <p>The memoir may very well be to our age what the novel was to the 19th century: the primary means by which we try, yet fail, to make a captive of time. ''What I Think I Did,'' the first in a projected trilogy of memoirs, opens self-consciously with the author in his car thinking about trying to write a memoir that will ''sidestep self-consciousness.'' What he doesn't know -- except of course in retrospect -- is that he will barely make it home from this trip into town and barely survive the next three or four days of a bitter storm with 40-mile-an-hour winds and 40-below-zero temperatures.</p>
        <p>The book is written in two ''Acts,'' the first the compulsively readable story of that blizzard, the second an account of Woiwode's years on the make in New York as a budding young actor befriended by the unknown 19-year-old Robert De Niro and as an aspiring writer taken under the wing of The New Yorker's legendary fiction editor William Maxwell. Between the acts lies an ''Intermission'' containing a series of religious and visionary experiences of searing intensity. Here, for example, is Woiwode's definition of faith:</p>
        <p>''There are times when, with a warning in my legs of spongy weakness, the earth is revealed as molecular -- able to give way any second, giving way -- and every gesture and word and thought of mine is being measured on a set of balancing scales (right foot, left) to an accuracy of millimeters within infinity. The earth itself is embroidery and my treading on it is communicated through a network so complex even the mightiest computer can't estimate its effect.''</p>
        <p>One thinks of Thoreau -- then of Jonathan Edwards. The secret of the exhilaration in this passage lies in the terror beneath it, in the feeling of being suspended by a thread over a bottomless pit. Woiwode's image of North Dakota farmers who, during blizzards, once went out for chores with ropes tied around their waists -- and often didn't make it back -- reinforces this sense of the natural world as an instrument not only of glory but of catastrophe.</p>
        <p>Like those farmers, Woiwode writes with a rope around his waist. His frame story, the blizzard, unfolds in the present tense, but the smallest moment may suddenly crack open and pitch its author into the past. The past is inside the present, not behind it, and numerous pasts can nest in a single moment. In one breathtaking passage, Woiwode wakes in the dead of night thinking of his daughter, Newlyn. Inside that thought unfolds a vision of the time when she was 12, then one of a tantrum she threw, falling backward to the floor, as a toddler of 3, while the remembered young father standing there watching her senses his own infant self holding his breath in a stroller inside him -- until Newlyn joins him there, crawling into his heart.</p>
        <p>The claustrophobia of such accounts of memory's labyrinths -- and of family life -- is acute in this book. And it thickens when the blizzard hits, trapping Woiwode's family in its small farmhouse. His harrowing description of repairing and feeding his ''wood-eating dragon'' -- his new outdoor furnace -- culminates in a desperate search for fuel in which he and his son cut up half-dead ash trees, stacks of hardwood in the garage and fence posts buried under snowdrifts. At one point, Woiwode even throws in chickens that have been frozen in the hen house and a garage-sale set of Dickens.</p>
        <p>The blizzard and its aftermath stretch across the whole book, though the storm recedes into the background during Act II, whose principal focus is the author's life in New York. Act II contains several violent moments with De Niro that could have come straight from a Scorsese film, as well as encounters with a score of literati, from Robert Lowell to John Updike, Eudora Welty and Norman Mailer.</p>
        <p>Above all, it contains William Maxwell. Woiwode's homage to this magnificently patient and generous editor, whom he meets for picnic lunches in Central Park, is all the more moving given the book's periodic reminders of the North Dakota winter in full rage. The contrast between the two worlds is palpable. In New York, all is ''radiant and full,'' despite the inevitable disappointments any young writer experiences and despite -- or perhaps because of -- a dizzying spiral of booze, grass and friends. North Dakota, by contrast, feels like the deep freeze of outer space, and venturing outside resembles a spacewalk. Yet one is the life Woiwode left behind and one the life he chose, and only the Intermission gives us a glimpse of why he made that choice. Woiwode's account of his driven emotional life in New York -- hopeful, vulnerable, cocky, passionate -- reaches its climax in an extraordinary scene in which he and Maxwell each break down crying at the latter's news that Woiwode is ''in'' -- that his first story has been accepted by The New Yorker.</p>
        <p>Larry Woiwode is an American original. He writes with a sense of both the quicksilver movement of language on the run and the reflective inner drag and furrowing of thought. The scarred beauty of his sentences and his eye and ear for metaphor are nowhere more evident than in his own description of how he struggles with words:</p>
        <p>''I keep at it on and off until the day I hear the auditory echo exerting pressure on my eardrums from the inside as camshafts of phrases turn within the whole of a sentence revolving along its length to a point where no iron can so pierce the heart (to paraphrase Babel) as a period put in the right place.''</p>
        <p>John Vernon's most recent book is ''A Book of Reasons,'' a memoir. His new novel, ''The Great Unknown,'' will be published next year.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 11, 2000, Sunday  Because of an editing error, a review of ''What I Think I Did,'' by Larry Woiwode, on Page 25 of the Book Review today misstates the name of a novel by Mr. Woiwode. It is ''Beyond the Bedroom Wall,'' not ''Behind the Bedroom Wall.''</p>
