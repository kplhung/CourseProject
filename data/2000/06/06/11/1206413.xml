        <p>FOR many homeowners, the benefits of adding a new room are often outweighed by cost: even a small addition usually runs into tens of thousands of dollars. Price, however, becomes less of a factor if an addition has no roof, no walls and no interior finishing touches.</p>

        <p>FOR many homeowners, the benefits of adding a new room are often outweighed by cost: even a small addition usually runs into tens of thousands of dollars. Price, however, becomes less of a factor if an addition has no roof, no walls and no interior finishing touches.</p>
        <p>''The deck is becoming an increasingly important part of many families' summer activities,'' said Robert Marshal, the owner of Craftsman Custom Decks and Porches in Beacon, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marshal said that while there may be limitations on the size of a new deck -- building codes often have minimum side-  and rear-yard setback requirements -- most properties have room enough to allow for at least some extension of the house into the outdoors. But, he said, just extending isn't enough.</p>
        <p>''Anybody can build a simple rectangle and stick it on the back of your house,'' he said. ''But a deck's shape and layout are very important. That's why it's usually best to hire an architect to draw up plans that take all the various factors into account.''</p>
        <p>Inexperienced contractors and homeowners who design their own decks, Mr. Marshal said, often do not consider circulation paths and privacy. ''You don't want to end up with a deck that makes people squeeze between a picnic table and a hot grill to get to the stairs,'' he said, adding that a professional deck designer will typically consider such things and may include a bumpout -- a small extension that juts beyond the main area of the deck -- for the grill.</p>
        <p>''And privacy panels are not just useful for privacy,'' Mr. Marshal said. The panels, sometimes made of lattice, extend above the railing and ''also provide a surface that can be used to attach shelves for storage and hooks for hanging utensils,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The panels, when combined with a well-designed railing and spindle system, can enhance the look of a deck from the perspective that counts most: the homeowner's. ''A deck should be beautiful to look at from inside the house,'' he said, adding that one mistake many homeowners make is to build the railing too high -- and that anything over 42 inches starts to look too high.</p>
        <p>''That gives the deck the appearance of a playpen,'' he said. Most building codes require the railing to be a minimum of 30 to 36 inches high, he said. Spindles, he said, should be spaced about four inches apart.</p>
        <p>It is almost always necessary, Mr. Marshal said, for a homeowner, architect or contractor to file plans and get a permit from the local building department before construction can start.</p>
        <p>Michael Hyman, the owner of BMI Decks in Pomona, N.Y., said that an economical way to transform an ordinary deck into a more special one is to, well, cut corners.  ''The cheapest way to jazz up a deck is to literally cut the corners off,'' Mr. Hyman said.  ''It's a good tradeoff. You lose only a little space but it looks a lot better.''</p>
        <p>Another way to enhance a deck, he said, is to run deck boards diagonally or in a herringbone pattern. ''I usually don't charge more for an angled pattern or herringbone,'' he said, explaining that some contractors might charge more because of the increased material and labor costs necessary for the angled cuts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hyman, like many deck contractors, charges on a per-square-foot basis, based on the material used.</p>
        <p>For premium grade, pressure-treated yellow pine decking, Mr. Hyman said, he charges $14 a square foot. For standard cedar, which generally contains some knots, and for clear cedar -- which is knot-free -- the charges are $16 and $18 a square foot, respectively.</p>
        <p>And for synthetic lumber -- a composite material made of plastic and wood -- the charge per square foot is $19. The prices include labor and installation. A 12-by-12-foot deck, 144 square feet, would cost from $2,000 to $2,700, depending on the materials.</p>
        <p>''Composites are becoming more and more popular,'' Mr. Hyman said.  ''They install just like wood and they're virtually maintenance-free.''</p>
        <p>Bill Renter, president of the Deck and Patio Company, a contractor in Huntington Station, N.Y., agreed. ''The nice thing about using a composite is that it doesn't split, doesn't crack and doesn't splinter,'' Mr. Renter said. ''And once it's installed, all it needs is an occasional washing to keep it looking like new.''</p>
        <p>While composite materials cannot be used for structural framing -- most contractors use pressure-treated yellow pine for the posts, beams and joists that support the deck -- composite decking materials are attractive for homeowners who want to restore or replace an existing deck.</p>
        <p>''If the framing is in good shape, we can tear off the old wood surface and replace it with Trex,'' Mr. Renter said, referring to the brand name of one composite decking product.  ''Even if your deck is 15 years old, this is a very economical way of getting a new deck that you'll never have to maintain again.''</p>
        <p>The charge for installing new Trex decking on an existing deck frame, he said, runs about $12 per square foot. ''And if the customer wants to rip off the old deck surface, we take $2 a foot off the price,'' Mr. Renter said.</p>
        <p>Those who are more ambitious have even more options.</p>
        <p>Jesse Taylor, the owner of Just Decks in Toms River, N.J., said that his company can provide custom-sized, precut deck kits that customers can assemble themselves.</p>
        <p>''Most times, homeowners who buy kits ask us to come out to dig and pour the footings,'' he said, referring to the concrete support posts that must be poured -- usually to a depth of about three feet -- to ensure that freezing and thawing will not affect the stability of the deck.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor said that a standard 12-by-12-foot pressure-treated yellow pine deck cut into a kit would cost about $1,800. That amount does not include extra charges for digging and pouring the footings.</p>
        <p>For decks he builds on site, Mr. Taylor said, he charges a flat price of $6 a square foot for labor. ''Then we ask the customer what kind of material they want, and we give them an itemized bill for every piece of lumber we buy,'' he said. ''We also give the customer the option of going out and purchasing the lumber themselves if they want to.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor said that customers should insist on itemized pricing when getting quotes. ''Most contractors will give a square-foot price for the whole job, labor and materials included,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''If you're dealing with a reputable contractor, that's not a problem. But some contractors figure that since the less they spend on the materials, the more they can put in their pocket, why not buy the cheapest material?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marshal said that another reason decks are becoming more popular is a concern about Lyme disease-carrying ticks. ''People still want to be outside,'' he said. ''They just want to stay off the grass.''</p>
        <p>But whatever the reason, Mr. Taylor said, more and more decks are being built. ''Everybody has different tastes and different needs,'' he said. ''But you can always fit a deck into your budget.''</p>
