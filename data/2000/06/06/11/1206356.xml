        <p>WHEN L. Kraig Steffen, a chemistry professor, arrived in Connecticut to join the faculty of Fairfield University in 1993, he beheld what he could only describe as ''a wasteland.''

        <p>WHEN L. Kraig Steffen, a chemistry professor, arrived in Connecticut to join the faculty of Fairfield University in 1993, he beheld what he could only describe as ''a wasteland.'' Yes, there were libraries, schools and cultural centers, but when it came to disk-golf courses, the state was bereft.</p>
        <p>''You had some rudimentary object courses, but nothing like out West,'' said Dr. Steffen, who previously lived in Arizona. ''If you wanted to play real disk golf, you had to go up to Mount Kisco or Massachusetts.''</p>
        <p>Today the situation is changing. Dr. Steffen has set up a permanent nine-hole course on the Fairfield University campus. An 18-hole course in Norwalk's Cranbury Park attracts dozens of disk golfers every weekend.</p>
        <p>Operating under the same concept as regular golf, which Dr. Steffen and others term ''ball golf,'' disk golf uses a flying disk in place of a ball. Also known as Frisbees, the brand name of one flying-disk model, disks are tossed toward a stationary object such as a post or tree. Hitting the object with the disk is like holing out in golf. In Pole Hole disk golf an iron pole is planted in the ground, a basket the width of a pizza pan stanchioned near its top. The golfer tries to sail a disk into the basket. Chains wound around the basket's mouth lead the disk into the basket if it flies near the pole.</p>
        <p>There are common features between disk golf and regular golf. Both feature par scoring, and disk golfers use terms like ''3-putt'' and ''good out'' just as regular golfers do. Wherever the disk lands is where the next shot is played. The disk golfer even carries a bag with a wide assortment of disks, or ''clubs,'' each of which serves a unique function.</p>
        <p>''It's what I'd call a niche sport, perhaps the best-kept secret of recreational sport,'' said Davis Johnson, president of the New England Flying Disc Association. ''It's run under the radar of public knowledge and comprehension.''</p>
        <p>But it is growing, said Jim Challas, commissioner of the Professional Disc Golf Association. He said there are more than 1,000 dedicated disk-golf courses across the country. There are 13 in the Greater Houston area alone, and a disk-golf resort, Sandy Point, in Lac Du Flambeau, Wis.</p>
        <p>''It took us from 1976 to 1980 just to get 100 courses out,'' said Jim Challas, commissioner of the California-based Professional Disc Golf Association. ''Then, boom, last year alone we had 187 new ones come in.''</p>
        <p>Edward Headrick, who invented the most popular model of the Frisbee in the late 1960's, and also the Pole Hole, estimated there are 15,000 recognized disk-golf professionals in the country, and as many as 2 million casual players.</p>
        <p>''It's pretty hard to nail down, because it's such an unorganized sport,'' Mr. Headrick said. ''You can just go and play a game in the park, without any superstructure or rules.''</p>
        <p>For many, it doesn't get more complicated than that. David Wollner, owner of the Willimantic Brewing Company brewery and restaurant in Windham, discovered disk golf 20 years ago while an undergraduate at the University of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''I played that course at midnight, under a full moon,'' Mr. Wollner said. ''It was fun. You'd visualize a perfect shot, like getting it through a tiny opening between a tree and a lamppost. When you threw it through, nothing else gave you that same kind of gratification.''</p>
        <p>The once-popular UConn course has been savaged by new construction. These days Mr. Wollner gratifies his disk-golf urges by playing at Mansfield Hollow State Park in Mansfield and Bushnell Park in Hartford. At Bushnell he plays against fellow brewer and pub owner Les Sinnock of the Hartford Brewery in Hartford. ''I find it relaxing,'' Mr. Sinnock said. ''It's a little competitive, but not so competitive you get on people about things.''</p>
        <p>What Mr. Wollner and Mr. Sinnock play is called ''object golf,'' where the disk is thrown at a particular landmark players agree on beforehand as a target. There is also throwing at simple posts stuck in the ground. Two of Connecticut's four permanent courses, at Southington's Camp Sloper and Woodstock's Roseland Park, use posts.</p>
        <p>Carl Emerson, a signmaker from Woodstock, designed the course at Roseland Park in 1989, planting the posts himself. It is the oldest course in the state, recreational in character. ''It's fun to play,'' Mr. Emerson said. ''It doesn't dominate you.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Emerson could, he would install baskets at Roseland Park, but the private organization that owns the land is wary of the strange-looking metal contraptions. ''I've stopped asking,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For most disk golfers, Pole Holes are preferable to posts. A disk will either land in a basket or not. Mr. Headrick calls object golf ''subjective'' because players must agree on whether one has hit a target or not, no easy thing when targets can be 300 feet away or more.</p>
        <p>Roseland Park attracts around a dozen players a month, while Cranbury Park, the only public Pole Hole course in the state, draws 40 to 50 on a warm-weather weekend.</p>
        <p>''With the sport growing, a lot of younger people are showing up, people from Norwalk who never experienced Cranbury Park,'' said Michael Moccaie, the Norwalk parks director. The Cranbury Park course was designed by Adam Fasciolo, a securities dealer at UBS Warburg in Stamford and a Norwalk resident. Mr. Fasciolo spent months trying to unsuccessfully persuade Norwalk civic leaders to spring for the $7,000 needed to purchase Pole Holes. In early 1998, after an anonymous donor in Ridgefield offered to buy the city some used Pole Holes, permission for the course was granted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moccaie, who said he now sees entire families going to Cranbury Park with disks in hand, compared Mr. Fasciolo to ''the first mother who ever dropped a soccer ball on a field.''</p>
        <p>Already there has been a domino effect with Dr. Steffen's course taking shape just months after Mr. Fasciolo finished work at Cranbury Park. Since the course at Fairfield University opened, Dr. Steffen has taken to mentoring campus students like Paul Bulakowski, a sophomore from Naugatuck majoring in neuroscience.</p>
        <p>''Renovations have put a little damper on the fun,'' Mr. Bulakowski said. ''Holes 1, 2, and 3 had to be moved with the library expansion.''</p>
        <p>There are human obstacles, too. . When Mr. Bulakowski plays with friends, one will usually run ahead to guard against a disk hitting a sunbather unaware of an ongoing game. Across hole No. 7 is another hazard, a pond favored by Canada geese.</p>
        <p>Cranbury Park has its own hazard: dogs. During a casual game with the Connecticut amateur disk-golf champion, Sunil Mehta of Greenwich, one of Dr. Steffen's better drives was immediately set upon by a pack of German shepherds and Labrador retrievers. One dog picked up the disk and started to run with it in its mouth. Dr. Steffen chased after, yelling for help getting the disk free.</p>
        <p>''There's going to be some teeth marks on that one,'' Mr. Mehta said.</p>
        <p>Because of the use Cranbury Park gets from non-disk golfers, which also includes bikers, horseback riders, and picnickers, Mr. Fasciolo is reluctant to promote it as a disk-golf course. ''If there were five times the land, I would say it should get more use,'' he said.</p>
        <p>There is talk about new disk-golf courses. Mr. Fasciolo said he has been approached by a Fairfield County-based Y.M.C.A. about building a course, as well as by a recreational center in Ridgefield. Meanwhile, the Bridgeport Community Historical Society is planning to set up a temporary course at Beardsley Park for a one-day tournament on June 18 as part of wider festivities honoring Bridgeport's claim of being the birthplace of the Frisbee. (The Frisbie Pie Company, based in Bridgeport, used tin plates for its pies that eventually evolved into the Frisbee.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehta, who owns the Paper Mill printing business in Greenwich and regularly travels to New York and Massachusetts for tournaments, chafes at the image of the sport as a haven for laid-back ''Deadheads'' not serious about competition.</p>
        <p>''They think of the beach, of relaxing,'' he said. ''It's not given the same credit as other sports. That sort of bothers me.''</p>
        <p>Disk golf will get a boost next year when it becomes an official event in the 2001 World Games in Akita, Japan. Mr. Fasciolo, who envisions a day when disk-golf tournaments are carried on ESPN, claimed the sport already enjoys broad appeal.</p>
        <p>''You have people who don't play on Sundays because they go to church,'' he said. ''Others will have a beer after a round. Most are liberal enough to embrace the sport, but it's really for everyone.''</p>
