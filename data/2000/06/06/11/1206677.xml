        <p>Fire officials yesterday were investigating the cause of a fire that gutted the Bergen Beach Stables, a century-old horse barn in the Mill Basin section of Brooklyn, killing 21 horses.</p>
        <p>The two-alarm fire broke out shortly before midnight Friday, engulfing the wooden, 46-stall barn at 1364 East 66th Street in 30-foot flames. Fire officials said 121 firefighters who were called to the scene brought the fire under control by 1 a.m.</p>
        <p>William Feehan, the first deputy fire commissioner, speaking yesterday at a news conference at the stable, said investigators had no evidence of foul play but had not determined how the fire started. Barns are not required to have sprinkler systems, he said, and because the barn was filled with hay, the flames moved rapidly through the stables.</p>
        <p>Firefighters, who said they could hear horses kicking their stalls wildly, sawed through a wall and rescued 2 of the 24 horses, including a badly burned pony belonging to the owner of the stables, Karen Facciolo. She got a call from a neighbor and arrived at the scene before firefighters did, watching in horror as her stables went up in flames, the horses trapped in their  stalls. A couple who live next to the barn saw smoke rising from the  stables and managed to rescue another horse by ripping apart the door to its stall.</p>
        <p>''The whole top of the barn was up in flames,'' said Ms. Facciolo, who has owned the stables for 16 years. ''The middle of the barn looked like a volcano.''</p>
        <p>Horse owners who were in the barn hours before the fire said all the electricity was shut off when the horses were put in their stalls for the night and no flammable liquids were kept inside the stables.</p>
        <p>Several horse owners joined Ms. Facciolo early yesterday morning and watched as the bodies of the horses, some of them weighing as much as 2,000 pounds, were hauled out of the smoky wreckage with forklifts. By late morning, a dozen devastated horse owners and young riders stood on the street at the edge of the three-acre property, now filled with the barely recognizable remains of a stable built in 1901, as the smell of burned wood wafted through the air.</p>
        <p>Some of them clutched pictures of their horses, consoling each other and talking about raising money to rebuild the barn.</p>
        <p>''This is a horror,'' said Irene O'Brien, who lost a bay-colored quarter horse named Added Incentive, but known as Arnie. Ms. O'Brien had kept that horse in the stables for the last five years.</p>
        <p>Ms. O'Brien grew up nearby, riding horses regularly, and her grandfather was a mounted police officer. ''Now I have to go tell my daughter that the horse is dead.''</p>
        <p>About 11 a.m., Ms. O'Brien broke the news of Arnie's death to her daughter, Desiree Fazzalare, 13, who has been riding the horse for several years. Desiree then joined the other mourners, wandering around East 66th Street, crying.</p>
        <p>''Whenever I could, I would go to the beach and ride,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Bergen Beach Stables was the last of three sets of stables in the neighborhood near Jamaica Bay, where many residents grew up riding along Bergen Beach or took their children and grandchildren to watch the horses munching on hay and trotting around the paddocks. One stable, a few blocks away, burned down in 1968, killing 54 horses and setting 50 others loose. Another closed shortly after that.</p>
        <p>Ms. O'Brien said she left the stable with Ms. Facciolo at 9 p.m. Friday after completing what had become a nightly ritual: taking her horse out to snack on some grass, locking him in his stall for the night and feeding him a few carrots.</p>
        <p>Bob Rizzo had kept two quarter horses, a mare and its daughter, at the stable for 15 years, spending hours each day in the barn. He had renovated their stalls to include skylights, fans and varnished walls. He said that when he learned early yesterday that the horses, Babe and Dancer, had died in the fire, he felt like he had lost his daughters.</p>
        <p>Two of the dead horses, Belgian draft horses named Jake and Betty, belonged to the city's Parks and Recreation Department, which was boarding them at the stables while they trained for the department's mounted park patrol. The death of the horses leaves the department with eight for the patrol.</p>
        <p>Two of the surviving horses were taken to the Brooklyn mounted police headquarters in Brighton Beach, where they were being treated by a veterinarian. Ms. Facciolo was keeping her pony, Dino, who was badly burned in the fire, in her backyard, a few blocks from the stable.</p>
