        <p>NOT long ago, guests had to leave their hotel rooms and venture into stores to shop. But these days, some of the finest hotels offer guests the chance to shop without getting out of bed. If you can't live without the pillow-top mattress you slept on last night, or the ice bucket, or the big black desk chair -- they're all for sale.</p>
        <p>For years, hotels have sold small items like monogrammed bathrobes and towels to guests who wanted to take home more than memories. Such sales were largely defensive. ''Anything with a little pizazz would disappear unless there was a sign attached that said it was for sale,'' said James Eyster, a professor emeritus at the Cornell University School of Hotel Management.</p>
        <p>But recently, hotels have become retailers on a grander scale, selling almost anything in the room. It's no longer unusual to find a price list on the bedside table. The polite prevention of theft is a big reason for the trend, particularly at boutique hotels stocked with stylish toys. At the Mondrian in Los Angeles, a card states that amenities are to be enjoyed ''during your stay'' and includes a price list should the trash can ($16) or the alarm clock ($32) prove irresistible.</p>
        <p>But old-fashioned marketing is behind the newest wave of hotel retailing. No one has taken the concept further than the two-year-old W hotel chain, which publishes a catalog of more than 25 room items, from a $55 chenille throw pillow to an $18 silver-plated yo-yo. Theresa Fatino, vice president of brand design and development, said she selected amenities for the hotels' high-style rooms with two goals in mind. ''We wanted to create an entire environment in each hotel and to make the guest think how great it would be to have the hotel experience at home.'' A former buyer for Pottery Barn, Ms. Fatino recalled how she and her retailing colleagues often picked up ideas for merchandise at boutique hotels in Europe and Asia. ''At W, we're doing the reverse and selling the items ourselves,'' she explained. So far, catalog sales have been solid but unspectacular; for the first quarter of the year, W sold $20,000 worth of bedding products from the catalog. But of course the objects also help publicize the hotel.</p>
        <p>Large-scale hotel retailing began quietly with mattresses and bedding. Last year 2,000 guests at Four Seasons hotels asked to buy the custom Sealy mattresses the hotels use. The New York Palace has shipped its Sealy mattresses as far away as Singapore. And by marketing its new Simmons mattress, pillows and sheets aggressively with  cards and an 800 number, the Westin hotel group sells three beds a day on average.</p>
        <p>Large chains are in an excellent position to become retailers, Mr. Eyster said. ''When you're buying something at a good volume, it's not a problem to tag an order on and sell to the public.'' And volume buying can make the price agreeable. This fall Wyndham Hotels and Resorts plans to sell the Herman Miller Aeron desk chairs used in their refurbished rooms for less than the suggested retail price.</p>
        <p>Staying in a hotel that sells furnishings allows guests to live with items before they buy them. ''What better way to test a mattress than to sleep on it for a night in a hotel?'' said Mr. Eyster.</p>
