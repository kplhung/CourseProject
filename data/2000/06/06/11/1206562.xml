        <p>WATCHING the waitress serve an outsize crustacean at the Brasserie Centrale at Broadway and 53rd Street, Don Hernando Criollo was incredulous. He turned to Don Luciano Mutumbajoy and declared in Spanish, choking back laughter, ''That's the biggest shrimp I've ever seen.''</p>
        <p>The ''shrimp'' was a lobster, but never mind. In their villages near Bogota, Colombia, where Don Hernando and Don Luciano are shamans, shellfish the size of soup tureens don't often turn up as dinner. The sight of this one was too much for Don Hernando.</p>
        <p>The pair had arrived in Manhattan just that morning, a week ago Saturday. As members of the Amazon Conservation Team, a private organization dedicated to preserving the heritage and medicines of the Amazon, they were in New York to raise awareness for their cause -- an activity concentrated, for the moment, in inviting the stares of passers-by.</p>
        <p>Their own expressions remained glazed -- the product of jet lag and culture shock. ''These guys won't look at you directly, but they're watching just the same,'' advised Mark Plotkin, an ethnobotanist and president of the Amazon Conservation Team, and the shamans' guide.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, at a dinner garnished with celebrities, they wouldn't need their peripheral vision to tell them that they were the main course. Sponsored by the W New York, a hotel aspiring to hip boutique status, the benefit was headed by Susan Sarandon and her old friend Todd Oldham, who had invited his new friend Alicia Silverstone, just in from her Amazon adventure, working for Woody Harrelson's conservation organization.</p>
        <p>Decked out at W in plumed headdresses that looked like upended chandeliers, the shamans eclipsed every star in the room, turning heads and all but daring the guests to gape. Through it all, they remained unflappable, prompting Mr. Oldham to burble, ''They're, like, your coolest friends at the party.''</p>
        <p>Four nights earlier, on Saturday, they were much more animated, sipping Coca-Cola and chattering away. Don Luciano called Mr. Oldham, who had invited them for the following day to his country house, ''a good man.'' He only smiled, however, when asked about previous meetings with the designer. ''They can't really talk about that, but I imagine there was some sort of cleansing,'' Dr. Plotkin said. He wasn't talking Lysol.</p>
        <p>Nor would Don Hernando and Don Luciano disclose the identity of the 42-year-old Hollywood star who had come to them several months ago for a spiritual consultation in the hope it might help her conceive. Nor would Dr. Plotkin reveal her name. ''But when we talked to her just a few weeks ago,'' he confided, ''she had just given birth.''</p>
        <p>What magic the shamans don't work here, they say they perform in the jungle. ''Many people come seeking cures, for their liver, their kidneys or for cancer,'' Don Luciano said. ''They go to places even more remote than we are, but they don't stay long. They don't have time to really learn much of anything.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Plotkin, who spends months each year in the Amazon, observed that these days the rain forest is choked with spiritual seekers. ''They're coming in search of Enlightenment Lite,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The shamans rose and headed down Broadway toward Times Square. Their faces lighted by the giant Nasdaq screen, Don Luciano looked Dr. Plotkin straight in the face and, referring to the plant-derived hallucinogen used in their shamanic rites, he marveled, ''These lights, they are brighter than Yaje.''</p>
