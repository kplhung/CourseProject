        <p>ROBERT ALTMAN turned 75 this past February, and he is working still. He has never won an Oscar, or had anything like an honorary statuette for his career. No Irving Thalberg award has come his way. Yet he has been nominated as best director four times, for ''M*A*S*H,''  ''Nashville,'' ''Short Cuts'' and ''The Player.'' I am sympathetic to all four pictures, but if they rate a nomination, what are we going to do about such unequivocally great works as ''The Long Goodbye,''  ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' and ''3 Women''?</p>
        <p>Of course, there are standard objections to Altman -- that he is wayward (bad box office), inconsistent (always himself), a maverick (tricky, difficult and evasive, as the moment calls for) and not an industry person.</p>
        <p>I doubt that he would pick a fight over any of that, or dispute his ups and downs. You can take your pick, but there's a generous handful of failures and mysteries in ''Buffalo Bill and the Indians,''  ''Quintet,''  ''Health,'' ''Popeye,''  ''Fool for Love,''  ''Ready to Wear'' and ''The Gingerbread Man.'' But Mr. Altman has always appreciated the rhythm of rest and doodling, sidetracks and utopian dead ends. Nor has he ever indicated anything like a trend. ''Short Cuts'' (1993) may be his last major work, and we may not have much reason to expect more from a man his age. But old man Altman is about as easily classifiable as the Luis Bunuel of his own 70's. In other words, watch out, and remember that he has been written off too many times for critics to feel secure. Mr. Altman is far too relaxed about his own status, and too addicted to cinema, for us to make up our minds in advance.</p>
        <p>The opportunity for these thoughts is the monthlong retrospective at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (starting today) of Altman's work in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>There is something like a critical orthodoxy now that the 70's was the last great age of American film. It saw the glory of Scorsese and Coppola; the best of Bob Rafelson, Hal Ashby, William Friedkin and Terrence Malick; it was also the age of ''Fat City,''  ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,''  ''The Deer Hunter,''  ''Chinatown,''  ''Two Lane Blacktop,''  ''Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid,''  ''The Hospital,''  ''Fingers'' and ''Paper Moon.'' The 70's are also a topic for controversy as to whether transforming events like ''Jaws'' and ''Star Wars'' celebrated youth and independence but then helped restore a film industry larger and less open than had ever existed before.</p>
        <p>Still, it is staggering just to recount the credits and reflect on the variety as well as the achievement of Mr. Altman in that decade. It begins with his biggest hit ever, ''M*A*S*H'' (still his lone box-office giant). Then, in addition to the films mentioned already -- ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' (1971), ''The Long Goodbye'' (1973), ''Nashville'' (1975) and ''3 Women'' (1977) -- it includes the vagary of ''Brewster McCloud'' (1971), two terrific genre pictures -- ''Thieves Like Us'' (1973) and ''California Split'' (1974) -- the nursing along of Alan Rudolph's early career (''Welcome to L .A.'' and ''Remember My Name''), as well as a true, resplendent folly (sadly not in the BAM series), ''Images'' (1972), made in Ireland as an inquiry into the child's sense of fairy tale and adult sensuality. He directed 14 films in the 70's, and no one's going to throw you in chains if you say that some were a lot better than others. But some were as good as any made in this country -- and horribly abused in their day.</p>
        <p>''The Long Goodbye'' was mauled to bits by Raymond Chandler connoisseurs and critics alike. The film opened once, took a beating, and tried again. But no large body of people could stomach its drastic, tender transcendence of Raymond Chandler and Philip Marlowe. After all, it was in the late 60's and 70's that the world really caught up with Bogart doing Marlowe in Howard Hawks's ''The Big Sleep.'' Film buffs rejoiced in and repeated the nearly screwball dialogue from that classic, and they cherished Bogart's insouciant, insolent mastery of the impossible plot, verbal rallies at the net with Bacall, teaching her how to kiss (that lifelong study in the Hawks world) and being so damn cool no one noticed the clouds of fantasy. You could read elegies to Hawks and his empiricism, as well as tributes to Chandler's noir gaze on Los Angeles. In that romantic moment of Bogeyism, many people felt that Altman's satiric treatment was nearly indecent.</p>
        <p>Is it possible, Mr. Altman asks demurely, that that black-and-white Marlowe was a touch far-fetched? Instead, he gives us a 70's man, a hipster in a black suit, Elliott Gould, cooler than Bogart ever dreamed of, muttering to himself, bemused by the naked girls across the way, unable to outwit a cat who wants curry-flavored cat food -- a sleepy, languid ramrod of inconsequence who sidles or side-steps through a life he has no hopes of being superior to.</p>
        <p>LADIES and gentlemen, here is something new in the world -- a sweet, decent chump for a movie hero. With nothing but Mr. Altman's fondness to keep him standing up. You almost hear Mr. Altman rhapsodizing over Gould -- look at him move, look at those bowed legs, the face scrunched up in the sun, logic turned crooked by L. A., and all that ''It's all right with me'' stuff. Is he beautiful, or what?</p>
        <p>Don't be put off, or alarmed, but one of the subjects of ''The Long Goodbye'' is nothing less than beauty, or the viscous sheen of continuity: the sight and sound of it, the treachery of overlap, and the games of misunderstanding that are played there. So you get lovely wolves like Jim Bouton and Nina van Pallandt (neither of them actors, but presences and liars that make the film tremble). You see the towering Sterling Hayden, like Hemingway cubed, until Henry Gibson's diminutive Dr. Verringer slaps him in the face and Hayden is a dead shell. You get the rich reflections of fatal movements on the Malibu beach played out in the heedless glass of windows. You get the lurking, mocking, masquerading fragments of the title tune, by Johnny Mercer and John Williams, lurching together, as if the film were not just a comedy but a musical, too.</p>
        <p>What's audacious is how, at the worst possible commercial moment, Mr. Altman slid ''The Long Goodbye'' into a post-modernist rapture that turned private eye conventions inside out. It's only when we've relaxed that he throws in maybe the most frightening moment in film noir -- so ghastly but so surreal it makes the connection with screwball comedy. I'm talking about Marty Augustine, the gangster who comes into the story looking for money and an audience. Mark Rydell plays him like a Jewish comedian who gets no respect, practicing riffs on his own thugs (one of whom is Arnold Schwarzenegger, before he was trusted with lines). But the comic turns nasty and worse, so nausea floods into the balmy night. Augustine has a girlfriend, a passive frozen beauty who waits out his routines until he . . . well, I'm not going to say. There are shocks that need protecting. Augustine is just another fantasist with a ticket -- like the people at the movies. But Mr. Altman is watching, asking us what we make of his arbitrary action. How are you going to read that scene, the film says.</p>
        <p>And then you realize that you (and eventually this lost Marlowe) must reconcile Elliott Gould's sunny resignation with the broad screen of iniquity as bright as Malibu and as blonde and wide-eyed as Nina Van Pallandt.</p>
        <p>The startling outrage is reason enough for ''The Long Goodbye'' to end in a kind of execution -- just one pal to another -- a whiplash reference to ''The Third Man'' and ''Hooray for Hollywood!'' (as if playing on an old radio). Just like the Augustine episode, it spins comedy and tragedy together. And just as the movie is a genuine tribute to the visual grace of L. A. -- day and night -- so it's a very ambivalent nod to Hollywood, and a roundabout admission that Mr. Altman regards himself as a hopeless chump in that barbarous place. Is there a better way of surviving?</p>
        <p>That question leads you back (in one of its own searching, fumbling zoom shots) to that other wistful idiot, John McCabe (Warren Beatty), supposedly as crisp and smart as his curly derby, but actually certifiably self-destructive, never more appealing than in those little rants to himself when he insists he has ''poetry'' in him.</p>
        <p>''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' came two years before ''The Long Goodbye,'' a Western of the sunless northwestern variety, with McCabe as the entrepreneur in a little puddle of civility called Presbyterian Church. He sets up a saloon and a brothel, but he is educated in such things by the arrival of Mrs. Miller -- a dead-eyed south London harpy, worthy of Dickens but the gift of Julie Christie to us all. And just as the Chandler films swings with jazziness, so McCabe plods along, grumbling to himself, to the plaintive lament of Leonard Cohen songs. He talks to himself because he usually puts his foot in it when he talks to others.</p>
        <p>Even then, Mr. Altman dodges his own emotional setup. You feel early on that McCabe is due for his comeuppance, and he is such a determined little boy -- so proud, so daft -- it is going to be bad. But he and Mrs. Miller are two awkward souls who begin to feel a need -- to admit their loneliness, to fall into an embrace, even couched as commerce. But then McCabe makes a royal hash of things when the local syndicate decides to buy him out. Warren Beatty's own ardor for negotiating is surely teased in the way McCabe has to beg to have some deal accepted in the end. No good. Too late, drawls the fur-coated Englishman (Hugh Millais) with a gun as big as a horse. So you think you're due for tragedy, until the chump manages to be a hero -- a fact known only to the three men he kills. Then, heroism sinks beneath the falling snow, part of the archaeology of the frontier -- unknown, yet poetical, too, and more than Mrs. Miller ever saw as she clung to her opium pipe.</p>
        <p>I've stressed these two films because they are such obvious companion pieces, such astonishing, heartfelt celebrations of loneliness. They are also works in the same style, a gorgeous marriage of multitrack recording, overlapping talk and wriggling, zooming, exploring camera. The chance to see these beauties, and really to ride with the camera and the sound across a large screen, is going to be a highlight of the Brooklyn series. Let the prints be as good as possible -- you may not have such an opportunity again in your life.</p>
        <p>All of this applies to ''Nashville'' too, the first great urge of the poet of loneliness to observe the crowd. It was Pauline Kael, famously, who hailed it in advance of proper release, and who made it a test case in Altman appreciation.</p>
        <p>SEEN again, it seems to me something less than ''McCabe'' and ''The Long Goodbye,'' and ''Short Cuts.'' I think it's a little daunted, and tight because of that, by the self-imposed duty to handle so many characters (and all their songs -- the least pleasing music in Altman?). So the picture doesn't flow under your door, like blood or wine; it knocks at the door. And its conclusion -- the big assassination -- still seems like an event decided upon in advance, and a way of getting off the stage (the earthquake in ''Short Cuts'' may be guilty in the same way).</p>
        <p>See it yourself, and work out what you feel -- that has always been the soundest policy with Altman. I'd rather use what little space I have left to urge ''3 Women'' upon you. It's a film, Mr. Altman said, that came to him in a dream. A rather arty dream -- when you think of the very organized color scheme (all pink, mauve and yellow) -- and dangerously close to a formula for discovering the health, independence and value of women. What makes it so real and affecting starts in the dazed, sisterly acting of Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek, so rooted in gesture and the unconscious that the film's potential for pretentiousness soon burns off. What remains is a portrait of individual strength and need -- of loneliness offset -- that means a great deal in the larger context of Mr. Altman's work.</p>
        <p>After years of watching him, I'm still not sure whether he is an optimist or pessimist. Early on, some good critics -- Robin Wood for one -- picked up an edge of cynicism in his work. It was there once, but it is gone, obscured in his endless inquiry into private lives and public situations. We make idiots of ourselves -- there's no doubting that -- but it is the philosophy of Mr. Altman's response and Marlowe's ''It's all right with me'' that is most intriguing and humane. If I could see the films big again in Brooklyn my opinion might be higher still. But this morning I will just say that ''The Long Goodbye'' is one of our great films, while Altman is our Renoir.</p>
