        <p>SIDIKI CONDE is a professional dancer who lives five flights up in an East Village apartment, eye level with the fluffy green of the late spring trees. What makes this remarkable is that Mr. Conde's legs are paralyzed. They dangle from his side like wounded wings when he walks about on his hands, the hands he uses to dance and to climb the stairs.</p>
        <p>But these days, there is a new complication in Mr. Conde's life. On a recent Saturday, just before he went on a cross-country tour for disabled athletes, Mr. Conde went downstairs for his wheelchair, which he had always stored in the lobby of his building. The chair was gone. Like any good New Yorker, he called 911 in a fit of rage.</p>

        <p>SIDIKI CONDE is a professional dancer who lives five flights up in an East Village apartment, eye level with the fluffy green of the late spring trees. What makes this remarkable is that Mr. Conde's legs are paralyzed. They dangle from his side like wounded wings when he walks about on his hands, the hands he uses to dance and to climb the stairs.</p>
        <p>But these days, there is a new complication in Mr. Conde's life. On a recent Saturday, just before he went on a cross-country tour for disabled athletes, Mr. Conde went downstairs for his wheelchair, which he had always stored in the lobby of his building. The chair was gone. Like any good New Yorker, he called 911 in a fit of rage.</p>
        <p>''Sidiki went down and I heard him shout,'' said his wife, Deborah Ross, an artist and photographer.</p>
        <p>Minutes later, Ms. Ross said, two police officers from the Ninth Precinct called in response to the couple's distress. The officers discovered that cleaners hired by the building's management had thrown the chair away by mistake. Everyone was sympathetic and apologetic, but Mr. Conde had no chair.</p>
        <p>''I see super,'' Mr. Conde, 39, a native of the West African country of Guinea, said in his fractured English. ''I say, you don't know my chair? I live here one year.''</p>
        <p>The chair fiasco was sidelined for a while because of Mr. Conde's participation in the Face of America's World TEAM Sports tour. (TEAM stands for The Exceptional Athlete Matters.)</p>
        <p>He rented a special bicycle chair for people who use wheelchairs and joined 149 other disabled people on a 22-day tour of 22 cities. The tour celebrated physical fitness and diversity in America, with athletes whose  disabilities included blindness, mulitiple sclerosis and paralysis. The athletes bicycled, ran, rowed boats and rode horses.</p>
        <p>''It was like making a new family, learning together,'' Mr. Conde said.</p>
        <p>The other night, Mr. Conde returned home to bad news. His chair had not been found.</p>
        <p>A new one will cost $2,000 to $2,500, Ms. Ross said. They had paid only $500 for the chair that was thrown away because it was a rebuilt secondhand model. In the meantime, they are renting a replacement chair for $155 a month, which Ms. Ross is subtracting from the rent.</p>
        <p>It is unclear whether Mr. Conde will be reimbursed for the $500 he spent on the chair or the replacement cost. Or whether the landlord will accept paying for the cost of the rental.</p>
        <p>Renie Teitelbaum, the managing agent for the building, said she was certain that things would be resolved to Mr. Conde's satisfaction.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure he's going to be reimbursed,'' Ms. Teitelbaum said. ''We may be liable. How do we know? One way or another, I'm sure he'll be paid.''</p>
        <p>Two days later, Ms. Teitelbaum said the matter was still being sorted out and she did not have all the facts.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Conde has received some acclaim for his dancing with his troupe Tokounou and another dance group, Les Merveilles de Guinea (he is ''a performer of immense warmth, skill and agility,'' the dance critic Jennifer Dunning wrote in The New York Times) he and Ms. Ross are far from financially comfortable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conde is one of 29 siblings and half-siblings and has an 8-year-old son in Guinea, whom he helps support. Through the Center for Traditional Music and Dance -- a nonprofit New York City group that supports ethnic performing arts -- he came to New York with Les Merveilles in 1998 to perform at Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>He spoke no English and lived in a Bronx housing project, where he gave children a quarter for every English word they taught him. In 1998 he met Ms. Ross, who had spent more than a decade traveling back and forth to Africa to paint and photograph, and he married her the next year. He sometimes teaches the traditional dancing and drumming of the Malinke tribe at the Djoniba School in Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conde's legs were paralyzed by a viral infection when he was 14. Yet because his arms are so powerful, he is almost completely self-sufficient, scurrying around the apartment on his hands.</p>
        <p>But the new chair is much heavier than the old one, which was light enough for Mr. Conde to pull around. New Yorkers are quite kind, Mr. Conde and Ms. Ross say. Someone is always willing to help him get the chair up and down subway stairs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conde has a plastic bag attached to a rope that he hauls down the window for passers-by to use when they pick up something for him from the downstairs grocer. Although a lot of people in the neighborhood know him now, even complete strangers have never turned down his requests, shouted from the window.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Conde is not shedding tears. He knows a new chair will turn up; in time, he hopes, for a dance conference for disabled people that he will attend in Miami starting June 18.</p>
        <p>''Dancing is like belief in God,'' he said. ''I didn't lose my hands, my mouth, my eyes, my mind. I use that. I'm not losing me.''</p>
