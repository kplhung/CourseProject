        <p>On the morning of April 17, 1975, Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge. Crowds spilled onto the streets to see the parade of soldiers in ragged black uniforms and tire-rubber sandals, some no taller than the weapons slung on their backs. That afternoon, the Khmer Rouge began emptying houses, offices and even hospitals, forcing out the city's two million people.</p>
        <p>Most left on foot and, after walking for days in the scorching heat, received another order from soldiers: to write their ''biographies.'' It was a simple ruse to ferret out intellectuals to be executed. But it also hinted at a crucial theme of the Khmer Rouge's genocidal regime: an obsession with the control of stories. Once in power, Pol Pot and his circle reacted to failures by eliciting bogus confessions through torture, by blaming spies and saboteurs, by telling every story but the true one. Their policies resulted in the deaths of more than 1 million Cambodians, from a population of less than 8 million.</p>
        <p>Now the stories are being told by survivors. Both Loung Ung and Chanrithy Him, 5 and 9 years old respectively, made that march from Phnom Penh, watched their fathers hauled away to be killed, saw their mothers and several siblings die by execution, starvation and disease. After the Khmer Rouge's downfall, both eventually escaped to Thailand and then to the United States.</p>
        <p>Several survival narratives precede these, but the best known are told from the vantage of Western observers, including the film ''The Killing Fields.'' Cambodia does not yet have its Anne Frank or Elie Wiesel, two storytellers who bore so hard into the particulars of their experience that they could speak for anonymous millions. Perhaps Ung and Him had these models in mind, as both chose to narrate their stories in present tense, from their point of view as children.</p>
        <p>Him and Ung were born into a powder keg. In 1966, Prince Norodom Sihanouk had allowed the North Vietnamese to move troops and supplies inside Cambodian territory. This prompted a furious bombing campaign by the United States. The deposed Prince Sihanouk then threw his support to the Khmer Rouge, which began its five-year drive to Phnom Penh and a bloody war punctuated by persistent B-52 raids, as well as an American invasion.</p>
        <p>''When Broken Glass Floats'' begins with Him's early memories of that war. Her family fled their home twice, joining 1.4 million refugees in Phnom Penh. After the fall of the city, they joined the other ''new people'' from cities forced to live among the ''old people'' in rural villages. Within two weeks, her father and her uncles were taken to the killing fields. The rest of the family began to wilt from hunger and overwork. Her younger brother fell sick with dysentery and, dying in a crude infirmary, begged for their mother to visit him. She sent word that she was too weak to walk that far. Most of the Khmer Rouge's victims died from conditions bred by cruelty and ineptitude. Forced to work digging ditches and planting crops, they were fed mostly rice gruel, which could only sometimes be supplemented with leaves, insects or frogs, mice and rats. Sickness was rarely accepted as an excuse to miss work. Those fortunate enough to make it to the crude infirmaries found no medicine, no capable staff. (The doctors had been murdered.)</p>
        <p>Him's life becomes a series of hungry nights, cruel work camps and narrow escapes. Some stories are harrowing, as when she crawls to the woods to find medicinal leaves for an infected gash in her foot, or witnesses a group of Khmer Rouge soldiers beating to death a pregnant woman and her husband with spades. These moments are blunted, though, by many vague passages tinged with melodrama. Him seems to strain to relate the immediacy of a time so long ago. She also tries to impose an adult's logic and values on a world that, to a child, must have seemed impossible, chaotic.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Loung Ung's child narrator sometimes seems like a puppet whose strings are held by the adult author. This 5-year-old knows words like ''coup'' and ''cadre,'' but also asks: ''What are bombs? Who's dropping them?'' This selective navete is not merely a problem of style. For example, Ung informs us that her father was an undercover intelligence agent for Sihanouk and an official in the Lon Nol regime, which was notoriously, pervasively corrupt. The family is also wealthy, with two cars, a truck, servants and drawers of antique jewelry. And yet, when she describes her father's work, Ung lapses into the voice of a dreamy child: ''His success never came from stepping on everyone along the way. Pa never forgot what it was like to be poor, and as a result, he takes time to help many others in need.'' Of course a small child would idealize her father. But in a memoir with so many adult insights, such a portrait comes across as disingenuous.</p>
        <p>The real moments of power in Ung's book come when she plunges directly into her experience, without mediation. Some scenes, for instance, vividly show her rage. With her parents and four brothers and sisters dead, she is conscripted as a child soldier, practices stabbing scarecrows dressed as Vietnamese soldiers, and at one point shoots a rifle shouting, ''I'll kill them! I'll kill them!'' After the Vietnamese occupation -- one that toppled Pol Pot but would later unleash terror on a smaller scale -- she hears that a Khmer Rouge soldier has been captured and released to a near-riotous mob. She runs across a field in time to see one woman bludgeon him with a hammer and another stab him with a knife. Fascinated by the spectacle, she follows the men who dump the corpse in a well.</p>
        <p>This scene accentuates Ung's grief and confusion and delivers, finally, on the promise of a child narrator who is real, vulnerable and plainly emotional, and brings readers closer to the charged wire that coursed through the Cambodian genocide. Having survived, and having every excuse to turn away, Chanrithy Him and Loung Ung both show heroism in their effort to draw closer.</p>
