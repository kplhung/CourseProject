        <p>Pres Clinton believes Israel's recent withdrawal from Lebanon has created a moment in time that imposes greater urgency on Israelis and Palestinians to resolve the very substantial issues remaining between them; but moments and deadline come and go, and urgency is one of the most easily manipulated commodities in the Middle East; manufactured urgency has been used to both derail and advance peace process, and all the urgent moments in the past quarter century have failed to produce peace; photo (M)</p>

        <p>GEORGE P. SHULTZ said it. James A. Baker 3rd said it. So did Warren Christopher and Madeleine K. Albright. When it comes to making peace in the Middle East, four successive secretaries of state all sounded the same theme: Americans cannot want peace more than the parties themselves.</p>
        <p>In other words, the United States must be both available and aloof, appearing as a willing partner but not an over-eager suitor. In fact, in late 1993, less than a year into the Clinton administration, Mr. Christopher set modest goals, saying that making peace was going to take ''a lot of time and patience.''</p>
        <p>Time and patience are the two things President Clinton no longer has. And now, with only seven and a half months left as president, he even may want peace more than the parties themselves.</p>
        <p>That was evident in Mr. Clinton's announcement, after meeting with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel in Lisbon 10 days ago, that peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians was ''within view now.'' He said the two sides would restart negotiations in Washington this week and his administration dangled the possibility of a three-way Camp-David-style summit in which Mr. Clinton himself would take part. The sense of urgency Mr. Clinton expressed was reminiscent of the pleading that the late King Hussein of Jordan was famous for, using every new political wrinkle and change on the ground to say that that was the last chance for peace.</p>
        <p>Administration officials and Middle East experts talk now of the need to seize the moment created by a new reality: Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon two weeks ago, which Mr. Clinton said imposes a much greater sense of urgency on the parties to resolve the very substantial differences that remain between them: the size and shape of a Palestinian state, the future of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.</p>
        <p>''There are only certain moments in history when all the parties are available, when they see that a negotiated deal is in their interests and they don't believe they have better options,'' said Thomas R. Smerling, Washington director of the Israel Policy Forum, a research institute that focuses on the peace process. ''This is one of those times.''</p>
        <p>But moments and deadlines come and go, and complicating matters now is the death yesterday of Syria's President Hafez al-Assad. Still, urgency is one of the most easily manipulated commodities in the Middle East. It has been used to derail progress toward peace. Witness all the years wasted because of Palestinian terrorist attacks and Israeli retaliation, troop movements and street violence. In that atmosphere, concessions became impossible.</p>
        <p>But urgency can, if invoked with skill, be used to push the region toward peace as well. The argument is that every opportunity is fleeting in the Middle East, where attitudes can shift with remarkable speed, so that when a moment is ripe for conciliation, it must be seized.</p>
        <p>Now, having run out of time for the more familiar formula of patience, Mr. Clinton is left with the appeal of urgency, in effect trying to turn his biggest liability -- his lame-duck status -- into an asset.</p>
        <p>Certainly, the moment is urgent for him. And certainly urgency is felt by Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>In an interview with the newspaper Haaretz last month, Mr. Barak spoke of ''a golden opportunity'' for Israel to make peace, not only with the Palestinians, but also with the Syrians and the Lebanese. ''Do we await the future passively with our eyes shut,'' he asked, ''or do we take an active stance vis-a-vis the reality and try to modify it to our advantage?''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Arafat, he has no good alternative. Unilaterally declaring an independent Palestinian state, as he has threatened to do, would deprive him of the aid and good will he has received from the rest of the world since he set out to make peace in 1993.</p>
        <p>Both men know that if they don't get a deal this year it may be a long time before a similar opportunity comes. Mr. Clinton offers a carefully built reputation as an honest broker that neither of the presumptive presidential nominees, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, enjoy. Over the years, Mr. Gore has taken an uncritical pro-Israeli stance; Mr. Bush is a blank slate when it comes to the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Still, the rushed nature of the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon has stirred up Israeli and Palestinian politics in ways that may prove damaging to prospects for a quick deal. Mr. Barak is fighting off a rebellion by conservative coalition allies that could produce new elections. And the frenzied meetings of long-divided families at the now-accessible Lebanese border could create a new dynamic for the extremely sensitive issue of what happens to the many Palestinian refugees who would remain outside a Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Clinton's pleas for urgency notwithstanding, the lame-duck year of any administration tends to limit its accomplishments in diplomacy. The last president to be finishing out a second term was Ronald Reagan; in 1988, Mr. Shultz launched a peace initiative after the Palestinians began the uprising known as the intifadeh, but the effort went nowhere.</p>
        <p>STILL, for any American negotiator, Middle East peacemaking requires both staying power and an unswerving belief in the impossible. ''There is a good chance to come to an agreement,'' said Henry A. Kissinger, who as secretary of state spent seven straight weeks shuttling between Damascus and Jerusalem after the 1973 war. ''Both sides have run out of options and both sides are at the limit of their concessions.''</p>
        <p>Asked what advice he would give Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kissinger said, ''I would tell him to stay calm and be available as a facilitator. And I would tell him not to be more interested than the parties themselves.''</p>
