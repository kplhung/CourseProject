        <p>DAWNING OF</p>
        <p>THE RAJ</p>
        <p>The Life and Trials</p>
        <p>of Warren Hastings.</p>
        <p>By Jeremy Bernstein.</p>

        <p>Americans need no instruction in the defects of impeachment. They saw for themselves in 1998 how it is politics masquerading as a legal procedure; how it is intrinsically unjust, tainted, inefficient and expensive. It is a medieval relic that should never be used again.</p>
        <p>What may not be so widely understood is that impeachment has always been abusive; it was invented in England in the 14th century for that very reason. In the 17th century King James I warned his son Charles against it, after Charles backed an impeachment that drove a valuable minister out of office. Sure enough, as king, Charles was impeached himself, condemned by a kangaroo court and executed. At the end of the 18th century the impeachment of Warren Hastings, former governor general of British India, on accusations of financial and judicial excess in his dealings with provincial officials, was somewhat less outrageous and had a happier outcome: Hastings was acquitted. But it dragged on for seven years -- itself a denial of justice. For almost two centuries the British have managed without the process.</p>
        <p>The story of Warren Hastings is well worth retelling. Unfortunately, Jeremy Bernstein is not the man to make the most of it. He has fallen in love with Hastings (these things cannot be explained). He feels his hero's wrongs as acutely as if they were happening today, and he rushes to the rescue. But he has not considered that most readers will not share his enthusiasm or be persuaded by wanton self-indulgence. ''Dawning of the Raj'' is characterized by slipshod English, a ramshackle structure and intolerable digressions (the worst being a whole chapter on the novelist Fanny Burney, irrelevant from beginning to end). And although Bernstein has done a reasonable amount of reading in the available authorities, he consistently displays a lack of informed historical judgment.</p>
        <p>For instance, he is severe on Edmund Burke, the chief prosecutor and persecutor of Hastings, and indeed Burke comes off badly in the story. The great assailant of the French Revolution, which among other crimes went in for rigged political trials on a large scale, himself conducted such a trial. Indeed, since the Hastings impeachment got under way in 1787, before the French Revolution started, he set the Jacobins an example of what demagogic oratory and contempt for due process could achieve. But Bernstein does not see that Burke was grappling with the fundamental question of whether the British should have an empire in India at all.</p>
        <p>If the empire was a good thing, and Hastings's actions were necessary to preserve it (it was on these grounds that he was acquitted), then the prosecution had no case. But Burke tried to show that the British record in Bengal was disgraceful. The ruthlessness with which the British squeezed money out of the Indians, so that the shareholders of the East India Company could enjoy dividends of 6 percent and the British government a revenue of</p>
