        <p>Warren Buffett is not a man given to emotional displays. But he appeared genuinely moved recently when Barbara Dodd Anderson, the daughter of David Dodd, co-author with Benjamin Graham of ''Securities Analysis,'' presented him with her father's own copy of the first edition, with his annotations.

        <p>Mrs. Anderson made the presentation last month at the Columbia University Business School class on value investing once taught by Graham and then by Dodd, and now by Bruce Greenwald.

        <p>Warren Buffett is not a man given to emotional displays. But he appeared genuinely moved recently when Barbara Dodd Anderson, the daughter of David Dodd, co-author with Benjamin Graham of ''Securities Analysis,'' presented him with her father's own copy of the first edition, with his annotations. This landmark 1930's book on value investing has been the basis for Mr. Buffett's strategy.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Anderson made the presentation last month at the Columbia University Business School class on value investing once taught by Graham and then by Dodd, and now by Bruce Greenwald. Mr. Buffett, who lectures there every other year, recalled that Mrs. Anderson's father, a tenured professor at Columbia Business School when Mr. Buffett applied there, had helped him get in.</p>
        <p>To illustrate how the book had become ingrained in his thinking, Mr. Buffett recalled that when he testified in the I.B.M. antitrust case, a lawyer for I.B.M. said Mr. Buffett contradicted a paragraph in the book. Mr. Buffett countered that the lawyer was citing the third edition, which had additional contributors, and that the paragraph was not in the first edition, which reflected only the work of Graham and Dodd.</p>
        <p>Professor Greenwald said the idea had come from Mrs. Anderson, who lives near San Francisco but stays in touch with the business school through Catherine Murray, former director of development.</p>
