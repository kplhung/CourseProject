        <p>The article on Cherry Grove [''Curtain Up! A New Season For Hedonism,'' May 28] was both inaccurate and unfair.</p>
        <p>If The Times wanted to write about the hotel at Cherry Grove and confine the story to the employees, guests and policies of the hotel, I would have no argument.</p>
        <p>But to paint the entire community with the hedonistic brush of the hotel's practices is just wrong. Many residents of the Grove have never even been to the hotel.</p>
        <p>Certainly there is a ''live and let live'' attitude on all of Fire Island, including Cherry Grove, but this does not translate into hedonism.</p>
        <p>Why the reporter did not interview longtime residents is a mystery. She would have found many couples in long-term commitments (50-year anniversaries are not uncommon).</p>
        <p>She would have learned of the regular Sunday gatherings for religious services, including a visit last summer by the Episcopal bishop of Long Island, when nearly 100 residents attended the worship service.</p>
        <p>She might have spoken to the dozens of both straight and gay couples who consider Cherry Grove their home and not just a place to have sex.</p>
        <p>It is especially ironic that the annual Miss Fire Island contest is labeled the Grove's ''signature event.'' While this contest may be good for business, most residents dread that weekend and many make other plans so they do not have to be here during this vulgar event.</p>
        <p>Perhaps The Times might want to revisit Cherry Grove and present a true and accurate picture of this little peace of paradise we cherish.</p>
