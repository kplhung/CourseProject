        <p>The Ethicist column on volunteering to work on private-school directory to give one's own child edge in applying; on revealing former employer's dot-com innovation to new employer (S)</p>

        <p>I volunteered to work on a directory of local private schools because it might give our 4-year-old daughter an edge when she applies to private school next fall. A friend argued that this was wrong: most parents were denied this opportunity because they either didn't know about it or didn't have time to volunteer; in other words, it smacked of exclusion. Was she right? -- Anonymous, California</p>
        <p>Unlike public schools, private schools make no promise of an evenhanded admissions policy but are free to enroll whomever they choose. Some favor the siblings of existing students; some favor athletes -- they'd be equally entitled to favor large tropical birds. It is not unknown for such institutions to rate the adults as much as the kids and to prefer parents who are rich or famous. Indeed, you might argue that offering an edge to parent volunteers levels the playing field for those who are not rich or famous or the mayor of a major East Coast city or the president of an important Western nation. So I'm more inclined to criticize a school for offering an unfair advantage than a parent for overreaching: getting your child into a good school can be fraught with anxiety.</p>

        <p>I volunteered to work on a directory of local private schools because it might give our 4-year-old daughter an edge when she applies to private school next fall.

        <p>Unlike public schools, private schools make no promise of an evenhanded admissions policy but are free to enroll whomever they choose. Some favor the siblings of existing students; some favor athletes -- they'd be equally entitled to favor large tropical birds. It is not unknown for such institutions to rate the adults as much as the kids and to prefer parents who are rich or famous. Indeed, you might argue that offering an edge to parent volunteers levels the playing field for those who are not rich or famous or the mayor of a major East Coast city or the president of an important Western nation. So I'm more inclined to criticize a school for offering an unfair advantage than a parent for overreaching: getting your child into a good school can be fraught with anxiety.</p>
        <p>Although your volunteer work may be acceptable within the ethical system of private schools, it's fair to question that system. Is it really honorable to cultivate an admissions policy that is so decidedly unegalitarian? Given the many excellent public elementary schools in a place like New York City, for example, does any 4-year-old there have a pedagogical need for private school? And does the establishment of a separate school system for wealthier families -- for that is what we are talking about -- contribute to the neglect of those children who are excluded?</p>
        <p>The utopian -- or at least longer-term -- solution is to improve public education enough to obviate your question, but if you're committed to private school, then your volunteer work does not discredit you.</p>
        <p>I work for a small dot-com that is developing a service that will be available in three to five months. I have been courted by a much larger dot-com, and during our meetings I learned that they will launch a similar service in two months, decimating the one offered by my current employer. I have not yet signed with the larger company. Do I tell my current employer about their plans? -- C. M., Australia</p>
        <p>You should alert your current employer to this powerful threat lurking over the horizon. You might save your boss a lot of money and help your co-workers keep their jobs. Unless the interviewers asked you to hold the conversation in confidence, you are free to discuss it; they certainly know where you work.</p>
        <p>If you plan to jump to the big dot-com, you may be tempted to keep this information to yourself rather than help what will soon be a rival. However, as long as you work for the small dot-com, you should show some consideration for its fate. In any case, if the big dot-com is as powerful as you say, you'll do it no harm by warning your current boss.</p>
        <p>And consider the tiny Hitchcockian possibility that the big dot-com is nowhere near perfecting that new service and is using you to carry disinformation behind enemy lines and scare your boss from the field. One misstep and you could be an innocent man swept into a whirlpool of intrigue.</p>
