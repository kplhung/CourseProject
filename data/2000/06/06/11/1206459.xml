        <p>Perhaps because he's new at this, Jon S. Corzine arrived in New Jersey politics painting ideological markings all over himself: He's a liberal. He's a Great Society kind of guy. Grouchy Republicans are already pointing out that he is eager to spend, not just his own money but that of everybody else.</p>
        <p>So how is a state that is wild about moderation going to respond to a platform that would not be out of place in Belgium?</p>
        <p>This is a question that Representative Bob Franks, who beat out two other moderates last week for the Republican nomination for the Senate, will be happy to ask as his campaign against Mr. Corzine engages. His theme was spelled out by the director of the national Republican Senatorial Committee, who said, ''If Corzine goes any more to the left, he'll be in Pennsylvania.''</p>
        <p>But that theme has not played so well lately. It did, in the Newt Gingrich era, forcing the national Democratic Party into the centrist postures that Al Gore is taking in his presidential campaign, which views New Jersey as crucial. But that was then, and that was before Mr. Corzine's $35 million primary campaign brought out voters who had not for a moment considered his plans for universal health coverage or pre-kindergarten programs.</p>
        <p>''It's never been about ideology,'' said Jon Shure, president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, a research group that avoids partisan identification but describes itself as ''progressive.'' Mr. Shure said that what befell liberals in the 1980's and 90's was not a rejection of their ideals but a superior Republican marketing effort, which has more recently encountered public relations disasters.</p>
        <p>''The conventional wisdom is that right now, Franks is the easier candidate to portray as the moderate because he's not anti-choice or pro-N.R.A.,'' Mr. Shure said. ''You can't say you're sending another Trent Lott or Jesse Helms to Washington.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Shure said the appeal to moderation was probably beside the point.</p>
        <p>''First, if you spend $40 million on your campaign,'' he said, ''it doesn't matter what your opponent says about you.''</p>
        <p>Second, Mr. Shure said, taxing and spending is not all that dangerous an idea anymore: when President Clinton opposed the call by the Republican Congress for a tax cut and won, the nation seemed comfortable with that.</p>
        <p>There is still no question that Mr. Corzine is not in Vermont or Minnesota, and would do well to put the most modest face possible on his ambitious proposals -- with price tags that a recent New York Times analysis placed at $20 to $40 billion for health insurance, $70 billion for expanded Medicare coverage and $55 billion for education. (Mr. Franks has his own analysis, giving a total of $346 billion for these three items.)</p>
        <p>And while favoring abortion rights and gun control seem to be fine with New Jerseyans, his opposition to the death penalty and his support for gay marriage are chancy.</p>
        <p>It's a fact of life that in a general election, most candidates edge toward the middle. And all in all, that is where New Jersey is.</p>
        <p>In a Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers poll in March, 60 percent of registered voters described themselves as moderate, 17 percent as liberal and 23 percent as conservative.</p>
        <p>Cliff Zukin, the director of the poll, said it had found that ''we're decidedly pro-choice, on gun control we are rabid,'' and on the death penalty ''we're for frying them, big time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zukin also discerns more Democratic sympathies in New Jersey than registration totals suggest. When the poll has asked self-identified independents -- representing about 40 percent of voters -- whether they lean to one party or another, the Democrats come out far ahead.</p>
        <p>The effect showed in the 1996 Senate race between Richard A. Zimmer and Robert G. Torricelli. As Mr. Zimmer put it: ''It should have been close, but Torricelli won by 10 percent.'' Whether all this makes New Jersey safe for a liberal is not clear. Senator Torricelli hews closer to the center than Mr. Corzine, though Senator Frank Lautenberg, whose seat he would be taking, is about of Mr. Corzine's ideological stripe.</p>
        <p>And whether the stripes matter is less clear. Mr. Zukin returns to the factor that so obviously gave Mr. Corzine 58 percent of the vote in his primary victory over former Gov. Jim Florio: he spent 15 times as much money.</p>
        <p>''The key here,'' Mr. Zukin said, ''is, does Bob Franks have enough money to show another face of Jon Corzine to voters?''</p>
        <p>That, of course, would involve depicting Mr. Corzine as a politically nutty dilettante, the rap that prevented Steve Forbes and Ross Perot from buying their way into office. Being portrayed as a politically liberal dilettante is another thing; it did not damage Mr. Lautenberg, a businessman who in 1982 came from nowhere with a stupendous television advertising campaign.</p>
        <p>The candidate in voters' living rooms is an avuncular character worrying aloud about senior citizens and sounding savvy in the ways of big money. Just how much he wants to spend on a social safety net seems like a distraction.</p>
        <p>''It isn't like there's a set of issues out there and the one people agree with will win,'' Mr. Shure said. ''Voters will draw whatever distinctions TV ads draw for them.''</p>
