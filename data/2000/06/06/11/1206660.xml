        <p>Skirting the racecourse in these famed sailing waters, the Sayonara, the maxi-yacht owned by the billionaire Larry Ellison of San Francisco, was easily the most conspicuous vessel in the spectator fleet taking in this week's Farr 40 world championships, which finished on Friday with an impressive victory by the Australian John Calvert-Jones's Southern Star.</p>
        <p>The Farr 40 series -- named for the designer Bruce Farr and his simple, fast and identical 40-footers -- may be the premier pro-am circuit in yacht racing.</p>
        <p>The worst-kept secret in sailing, according to the dockside chatter in Newport, is that Ellison, the founder of Oracle, the computer software company, is on the cusp of announcing his challenge for the 2003 America's Cup. If Ellison is indeed in the market for cup talent, he came to the right place.</p>
        <p>The professional tacticians in the 27-boat Farr regatta, sponsored by boats.com, which debuts on the Internet this month, included the cup-winning Kiwi star Brad Butterworth, the America One skipper Paul Cayard and seasoned cup competitors like Tom Whidden, John Kostecki, Peter Holmberg and Terry Hutchinson of the United States, and the Australians Rob Brown and Grant Simmer, who played major roles when Australia won the cup off Newport in 1983. It was Simmer, one of the world's most underrated sailors, calling the shots on the victorious Southern Star.</p>
        <p>According to the Farr 40 class rules, the onboard pros (in the 10-person crew, just 4 are allowed) can call tactics and trim sails, but only the boat's owner is permitted to steer. So it is not unusual in a frenzied mark rounding to see the likes of a Butterworth or a Whidden hunched behind a helmsman barking a stream of instructions. Driving a Farr 40 can be sailing's equivalent of having Tiger Woods caddie for you in the club championship.</p>
        <p>''The owner-driver rule has really raised the skill level of all the owners in the class,'' said John Thompson, whose Solution took fifth in the regatta. ''You can be 15th or 20th in a given race and when you look around you see an awful lot of good guys around you.''</p>
        <p>Like Thompson, John Kilroy -- his defending class champion, Samba Pa Ti, finished second this year -- traded down from a string of larger grand prix racers to join the Farr 40 contingent.</p>
        <p>''I spent 35 years sailboat racing all over the world in maxis and other classes and it got to the point where I was exhausted by changing keels and rigs all the time to remain competitive,'' he said. ''But this boat has brought back the fun of sailing.''</p>
        <p>Though a Farr 40 is not inexpensive, Geoff Stagg of Farr International said a race-ready boat with sails and electronics costs about $315,000. The class is growing rapidly. The builder Barry Carroll makes three a month, and by next year the worldwide fleet will number over 110 vessels.</p>
        <p>''It's obviously a lot of money, but a custom 40-foot racer will run over 700 grand,'' Stagg said. ''So there's a lot of value there. And all the boats are dead-nuts even. So at the end of the day, there are no excuses. The owners in this class are wealthy, driven, successful people. If they have a bad regatta, they know there's no one else to point at.''</p>
        <p>If the owner-driver rule is one of the class cornerstones, so too is the simplicity of the design. ''It's got a swept-back carbon-fiber rig with small jibs and no running backstays,'' said the pro racer Robbie Haines, who called tactics on George Andreadis's third-place Atalanti.</p>
        <p>Over the course of this week's event, the sailors were tested in conditions ranging from Tuesday's bleak, unseasonable, 30-knot northeaster to Friday's classic 15-knot smoky southwesterly. The top spot on the leader board changed continually until the crew aboard Southern Star sealed the championship with third- and fourth-place finishes on the final day of racing. ''Our team was fantastic, and Grant did a superb job of getting us around the course,'' said the winning skipper, Calvert-Jones, referring to Simmer.</p>
        <p>In keeping with the week's synergy, rumor had it that Bruce Farr would design Ellison's America's Cup racers if he decides to challenge.</p>
        <p>If Ellison's goal is to win the cup, it was apparent this week that there are plenty of skilled hired guns out there. But if Ellison's aim is to become a better sailor, he should consider buying a Farr 40.</p>
        <p>MAKING WAVES</p>
        <p>Next Friday, up to 190 boats are expected to cross the starting line to begin the 42nd sailing of the biennial 635-mile Newport-Bermuda race, organized by the Cruising Club of America and the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club.</p>
