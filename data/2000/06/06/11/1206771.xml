        <p>BEATUS-Jerome S. It is with profound sorrow that we announce the untimely passing of Jerome S. Beatus, June 7, 2000. Beloved husband of Sylvia, father of Bruce, Richard and Phyllis Jacoby and brother of Gilbert. Jerome was President of Walton Press, Inc., Printers, for 45 years. Services Sunday, 12:30 PM, at Schwartz Bros., Queens Boulevard.</p>
        <p>BEATUS-Jerome. To lose our friend Jerry is to lose a piece of our collective soul. Jerry and Sylvia were at the heart and center of our group. He was a kind, gentle, thoughtful, optimistic man and we loved him and will miss him. The Buccaneers will never be the same, but Jerry will be in our hearts forever. Larry and Paula Armus Harold and Eleanore Geringer Norman and Sandi Liss Harold and Sally Weisman</p>
