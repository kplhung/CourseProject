      <abstract>
        <p>Michael Beschloss, Op-Ed article finds it hard to make case that great leaders must be great scholars or avid readers; notes only Woodrow Wilson of all 20th century Presidents can reasonably be called an intellectual, while some very successful Presidents were decidedly not great intellectuals and did very little reading for pleasure or for educational purposes</p>

        <p>Lyndon Johnson was no great reader. But his handlers thought he had better look like one.

        <p>Lyndon Johnson was no great reader. But his handlers thought he had better look like one. Thus when Life's Hugh Sidey questioned Johnson's staff about his reading habits, all swore that L.B.J. was a voracious reader. But when pressed for examples, aide after aide mentioned the same book -- Barbara Ward's ''The Rich Nations and the Poor Nations.''</p>
        <p>Johnson's former press secretary, George Reedy, observed years later that his boss's I.Q. ''took a back seat to very few others.'' ''But,'' Reedy said, ''he simply could not see a concept without an immediate, pragmatic objective.''</p>
        <p>Among the modern presidents, Johnson was hardly alone. If an intellectual is defined as someone passionately interested in ideas for their own sake, then in the past century, we have sent exactly one intellectual to the White House -- Woodrow Wilson.  Yet it seems that in every presidential campaign season, we demand that our candidates prove their depth. They are asked to tell us the books they've read, what presidents they've been influenced by, how they did in school. This campaign season has proved no exception, and attention has been focused on the presidential finalist George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Certainly no one would argue that intellectual curiosity is unimportant  in a president. But much as a historian who writes books might prefer to argue otherwise, it is harder to make the case that great leaders must be great scholars.</p>
        <p>Wilson was a political scientist who had spent his career imagining what presidents must do to influence Congress and the people. Wilson's great achievement as president was to persuade Americans, with impressive subtlety, to accept radical economic reforms and internationalism.</p>
        <p>In those days, before the age of mass media and mass participation, a president had to convince the elites that owned newspapers and ran political organizations of his cause. This allowed and even encouraged the nuances of a political philosopher. But Wilson was so much more a man of theory than of action that he resisted compromise and sabotaged his own effort to win American participation in the League of Nations.</p>
        <p>Ronald Reagan's presidential persona was almost the opposite of Wilson's. Mr. Reagan was a puckish booster for Calvin Coolidge and Franklin Roosevelt (he admired F.D.R.'s dramatic style, not his ideology), and he was conversant with the ideas of Russell Kirk and some other conservative thinkers of his day, which he used to buttress his preconceptions about big government.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Reagan rarely showed interest in the historical precedents for what he was doing. In a way, this nonintellectualism helped him. In the age of the mass market, had Mr. Reagan spoken with the complexity of a Wilson, he might not have been so successful. Instead, it was the simplicity of his convictions, repeated over and over again, that helped him oversee a transformation of American political thought -- to the conservatism of the 1980's. (Mr. Reagan's Olympian approach could also blind him, as in the Iran-contra scandal.)</p>
        <p>Two of the 20th century's most commanding presidents -- Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson -- exercised strong leadership without being much more than casual students or readers. Roosevelt was a gentleman's ''C'' Harvard student with a short attention span. As a presidential candidate, he was derided by Walter Lippmann as the ''Prince of Pap.''</p>
        <p>Lyndon Johnson was painfully sensitive about his modest education at Southwest Texas State Teachers College. He was always searching for gimmicks -- White House symposiums, intellectuals-in-residence -- that would give him the scholarly patina that John Kennedy had enjoyed.</p>
        <p>They didn't work. After a meeting with the president, one historian blustered, ''Doesn't that man know what I do? He asked me to write a speech for him on foreign affairs. . . . My specialty is the desert!''</p>
        <p>Yet Roosevelt's and Johnson's nonintellectualism seldom got in the way. They enlisted legions of scholars in and out of government in the effort to build both the New Deal and the Great Society.</p>
        <p>Yes, presidents should read books, and a host of modern presidents have been changed by what they have read in office. Barbara Tuchman's ''The Guns of August,'' which traced the miscalculations that brought World War I, emboldened Kennedy to avoid similar errors during the Cuban Missile Crisis. After reading Robert Blake's ''Disraeli,'' Richard Nixon emulated the 19th-century British leader by surprising enemies with liberal policies (like the opening to China).</p>
        <p>As we assess Al Gore and George W. Bush in this campaign, we must also remember that appearances can be deceiving. As president, Dwight Eisenhower was content to let Democrats lampoon his ''lowbrow'' tastes in music and literature (Lawrence Welk and Louis L'Amour). But, as we now know, Ike had both a formidable command of military history, gained through decades in the Army, and an intellect that allowed him, more than anyone realized, to manage the peace and prosperity of the 1950's.</p>
        <p>Eisenhower's two-time opponent, Adlai Stevenson, was revered on the Upper West Side and in Cambridge, Ann Arbor and Berkeley as the ''thinking person's candidate,'' an egalitarian lover of literature, history and ideas. Only long afterward did those outside his circle discover that, while Stevenson had a pleasing respect for academics and the humanities, and while he took impressive care to write many of his own speeches, he could go quite happily for months or years without picking up a book. Indeed, on his nightstand, on the day he died, was but a single volume -- the Social Register.</p>
