        <p>HALF A HEART</p>
        <p>By Rosellen Brown.</p>

        <p>Rosellen Brown likes to explore what happens when a family -- a perfectly nice family, with all the right values -- gets slammed by a meteor from its own past. Often in her novels it's children who embody the long-hidden truths that shatter a family's protective sense of itself. ''Civil Wars,'' published in 1984, describes a couple of former civil rights activists wrestling with their aging principles who must open their home and lives to a newly orphaned niece and nephew, both imbued with their parents' racism. In her 1992 best seller, ''Before and After,'' a teenager kills his girlfriend and the crime exposes moral and psychic crevices in his family that none of its members have ever confronted. Typically, Brown alternates points of view among different characters, suggesting that a sense of family is being rewoven even as contrasting voices underscore the isolation of the family's individual members.</p>
        <p>Her new novel, ''Half a Heart,'' unfolds along similar lines, with a long-lost daughter showing up both to challenge and to recreate a family bond. Brown even returns to the volatile issues that prompted ''Civil Wars'' -- race and racism, integration and separatism, the 1960's and the present. Both ''Civil Wars'' and ''Half a Heart'' are about conscience as much as anything else: once we've chosen decency, how do we keep choosing it when the definition seems to change with every decade? But while ''Civil Wars'' places this discomforting debate at the center of a marriage, ''Half a Heart'' tucks it inside a woman's soul and lets it fester there for years.</p>
        <p>Miriam Vener is a rebel who has lost track of her cause. A wife and mother living in Houston in the mid-1980's, she has a spacious house decorated in perfect taste. Her clothes are expensive and well cut, so is her hair; she goes to the gym regularly. ''Once upon a time she had studied the necessary details for her masquerade costume,'' Brown observes. ''By now she was beyond having to think of them.'' But nearly 20 years earlier, Miriam was wearing jeans and an Army jacket and leaving graduate school to teach at a black college in Mississippi. To her dismay, the students were bored and sullen, contemptuous of the white Northerner trying to teach them American history. Falling in love with Eljay Reece, a brilliant black musician who was also a member of the faculty, renewed her faith in the whole effort. But by the time she learned she was pregnant, Eljay was already turning away from her, entranced by a new movement that preached black power and separatism. When their baby, Veronica, was 8 months old, he managed to wrest her from Miriam, who left Mississippi in a blur of guilt and grief that ultimately froze solid around her.</p>
        <p>Now Veronica is 18, and Miriam at last decides to seek her out. There's no fairy-tale quality to their reunion as the two size each other up at the door of the faded building in Brooklyn where Veronica lives with her father. She calls herself Ronnee now, and she's a smart, cynical teenager who grew up believing that her rich white mother walked out on her. Though she is as wary as Ronnee, Miriam is unwilling to admit that this long-awaited moment will have any but joyful repercussions. Yet the first time she and Ronnee meet a friend of Miriam's, in the small New England town where she spends her summers, Miriam finds to her horror that she doesn't know what to say. In a panic, she ends up introducing her daughter as just another holiday visitor.</p>
        <p>''Half a Heart'' has many of Brown's stylistic trademarks, including the shifting viewpoints and detailed flashbacks that make her narratives multidimensional without bogging them down. But there are also places where she seems more rushed, more given to contrivances than in previous books. The first couple of chapters in particular feel tightly condensed, as if she were hurrying to set the stage before raising the curtain on the novel proper. There's one of our first glimpses of Miriam, for instance, entertaining at poolside but detached and lonely. Nobody but her husband knows her secret loss and torment; her politics are repressed, too, for all she does now is write checks and attend charity functions. Other important bits of information are planted just as summarily, and much of it never quite convinces.</p>
        <p>Miriam's misery is just too overwhelming, her friends too bigoted, her ailing mother's brush with death -- which draws Ronnee and Miriam quickly back to Houston -- too conveniently timed. The mild-mannered ophthalmologist we know as Miriam's husband remains such a hazy figure that their marriage is incomprehensible. Only Ronnee, who doesn't make an entrance until the novel is well on its way, has complexities that are palpably rooted in character.</p>
        <p>Yet ''Half a Heart'' is genuinely powerful, partly because Brown is a fine writer (Ronnee as a baby ''gave off warmth like a small thrumming motor'') and partly because the reunion at its core is about much more than a mother and a daughter. Forced to turn her back on her baby, Miriam has also surrendered her convictions, the moral passions that sent her to Mississippi in the first place. The closest she'll come to taking a public stand is an occasional outburst at a cocktail party. Reconciling with Veronica means restoring what was once the best part of herself, however awkward the changes she will have to encompass. But for Ronnee, the moral politics are very different and call for even greater courage. Miriam symbolizes everything she has been raised to disdain: accepting her mother seems horribly tantamount to accepting the most contemptible part of herself, as well as rejecting the father who loves her.</p>
        <p>A press release for ''Half a Heart'' says the book was published ''just in time for Mother's Day'' -- a bit of timing that the story itself hardly seems to justify. What brings Miriam and Ronnee together isn't love, Hallmark style; it's a longing for wholeness, for an integrity that neither woman knows until she sees the other's face. Pain, doubt and frustration will always be part of their relationship; as Brown makes clear, some of the losses incurred when you turn your back on the past can never be made up. But by stripping most of the customary emotions from this mother-daughter bond, Brown shines a light straight through to the heart of it. In the end, she leaves us with a hint of sentiment that's all the more welcome for being hard won. Maybe a touch of Mother's Day isn't out of order after all.</p>
