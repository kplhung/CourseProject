        <p>On Aug. 27, 1998, Brian L. Buckley, a Los Angeles lawyer, received an e-mail message from someone he did not know, a New York literary agent, Lucianne Goldberg. Her one-sentence message to him said, ''Someone very important wants to know who you are.''</p>
        <p>The important someone turned out to be Linda R. Tripp, whose tape-recorded conversations with Monica S. Lewinsky set off the investigation that led to the impeachment of President Clinton.</p>
        <p>It turned out that Mrs. Tripp had been reading and finding inspiration in Mr. Buckley's observations about the Lewinsky scandal on a conservative, anti-Clinton Internet site, FreeRepublic.com. Mr. Buckley frequently posted his legal insights on the Lewinsky case using the screen name Clarity.</p>
        <p>In the ensuing months, Clarity and Mrs. Tripp began a friendship that blossomed from e-mail messages to telephone calls. In the electronic age, such friendships between public figures and private citizens, who meet by chance on the Internet, are becoming far more common.</p>
        <p>''She and I are pals by now,'' said Mr. Buckley, who is also a lawyer for FreeRepublic and heads an affiliated research group. He became an informal adviser to Mrs. Tripp as she battled criminal charges filed against her by the State of Maryland for taping her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky without Ms. Lewinsky's knowledge. The prosecutor dropped the charges in May, saying he would not pursue them because a judge had suppressed crucial testimony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buckley did not actually meet Mrs. Tripp until June 3, at a FreeRepublic tribute dinner for Mrs. Tripp in Charleston, S.C. Mr. Buckley, 45, e-mailed a photograph of himself to Mrs. Tripp so that she would recognize him. He said he was almost overcome by unexpected emotion and had to ''catch my breath,'' as Mrs. Tripp made her entrance at a buffet dinner of fried chicken and barbecue, where about 60 supporters gave her a standing ovation and waved a homemade banner emblazoned ''Linda Tripp. Hero. Patriot.''</p>
        <p>In her dinner speech, Mrs. Tripp said that the electronic postings of Clarity and other FreeRepublic supporters had been a source of comfort to her. As a way of thanking supporters, Mrs. Tripp said, she chose the conference sponsored by the Southeastern chapter of FreeRepublic for her first public speech after the dismissal of the state charges.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Tripp spoke for more than an hour, appearing nervous at times. The guests, who paid $50 to attend, were told that they could not tape her remarks or take her photograph. Mrs. Tripp said she was not used to speaking in public and hoped she would make it through her talk ''without fainting.''</p>
        <p>More than anything, her talk provided a glimpse of what Mrs. Tripp's life has been like since she became a starring player in the Lewinsky investigation. She described how she went from being addicted to cable news shows to depending almost solely on Internet sites like FreeRepublic for news.</p>
        <p>''They say I crave fame but I spend all my time trying to hide from the media,'' she said. After the Lewinsky scandal broke in January 1998 and journalists camped out in her driveway, Mrs. Tripp said, ''I was living in a bunker with sheets over the windows,'' a virtual prisoner in her own home. In her speech, she said she found herself compulsively watching the 24-hour cable news shows about the scandal.</p>
        <p>''I was so addicted to the TV coverage that I almost never slept,'' she said. Often, she said, she found herself shaking her head in disagreement with the televised commentary. By the summer of 1998, she said, her head was shaking so much that she worried she might have a neurological problem. She stopped watching network or cable news for good.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mrs. Tripp said, she began getting all her news from FreeRepublic.com, the Web site frequented by Lucianne Goldberg, who was Mrs. Tripp's confidante. It was devoid of the ''derogatory slams on my appearance'' and ''vile things, too vile to repeat,'' which  Mrs. Tripp said she found so hurtful in the mainstream news media. The friendlier commentary from Clarity and other FreeRepublic contributors encouraged Mrs. Tripp to believe that her support ''was more widespread'' than she had thought.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buckley, whose legal specialty is intellectual property, said he often posted his legal analysis of the Lewinsky matter, but was surprised when he first heard from Mrs. Goldberg. He wrote her back a detailed e-mail message explaining his background, which included undergraduate work at Dartmouth, and law school at William and Mary.</p>
        <p>''Given the ordeal that Linda endured over time,'' Mr. Buckley said, ''if you were in that position, you would relish a place on the Internet where you could put your feet up and relax and get some news.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Tripp told the dinner guests: ''I've rejected many other higher profile speaking engagements. I am not a public person.''</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Tripp is not fading away so quietly. She has filed a civil lawsuit against the Clinton White House and the Pentagon claiming they breached the Privacy Act in releasing information from her employment file. ''We'll be subpoenaing every national name in the White House,'' she promised. Clarity, meanwhile, is giving her some informal legal advice.</p>
