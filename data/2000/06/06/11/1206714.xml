        <p>Shortly after Vice President Al Gore moved his campaign headquarters from Washington to downtown Nashville in search of an outside-the-Beltway image, anti-Gore ads began showing up on billboards near the new digs. Many were paid for by the Republican National Committee, and the committee's chairman, Jim Nicholson, said he hoped Mr. Gore and his aides found them so annoying that ''their teeth hurt, like scratching nails on a blackboard.''</p>
        <p>Typical ad: A picture of Mr. Gore embracing President Clinton, with a Gore quote underneath from the impeachment days: ''One of our greatest presidents.''</p>
        <p>Whether the ads set the Gore camp's teeth on edge is but a guess. But this much is clear:</p>
        <p>Last week the Gore headquarters was moved again, to a suburban mall where nary a billboard is in sight.</p>
        <p>Needed more office space, Gore aides explained.</p>
        <p>Needed more space between the office and the billboards, Republican officials gloated.</p>
