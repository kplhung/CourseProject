      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Freedy Johnston possesses exceptional ingenuity for composing austere pop songs and has been compared with Elvis Costello and Bob Dylan. His 1992 album ''You Can Fly'' and 1994's ''This Perfect World'' captivated listeners with complex fatalistic narratives and abstruse melodies. His more recent sound, as demonstrated on ''Blue Days, Black Nights'' has headed toward the Jackson Brown-James Taylor school of laid-back singer-songwriter fare.</p>
        <p>From his travels in his home state of Kansas to his adopted Hoboken, his songs have the pervasive sense of a loner. He brings his lethargic, sweet songs and his introspective mood pieces to Maxwell's in Hoboken at 10 p.m. Friday.</p>
