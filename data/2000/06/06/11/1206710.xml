        <p>It has been 11 years since the Great Hudson River Revival has been at ''full strength,'' as Ron Aja, the producer of the event describes it. But this year, the 34th annual festival, which opens next Saturday will have 90 performers on five stages, including Dar Williams, Holly Near, Janis Ian, Pete Seeger, Vance Gilbert, Josh White Jr. and the Children's Gospel Choir of Peekskill.</p>
        <p>''In the past we've had to cut back for budgetary reasons,'' Mr. Aja said. ''When we were at Marist College, we had to cut back by a third.''</p>
        <p>This festival is spending its second year back at Croton Point Park. It left the partk 11 years ago, Mr. Aja said, because the landfill abutting the park ''was oozing green slime into the river.'' Since then, a $12 million renovation has capped the landfill.</p>
        <p>An estimated 15,000 people are expected to attend the festival, which is sponsored by Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, the environmental organization.</p>
        <p>Asked if the festival raises money, Mr. Aja said: ''We hope so, but sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it just raises conciousness.''</p>
        <p>Admission is $30 a day, or $40 for the entire weekend. For seniors, students and the disabled, tickets are $20 a day, or $25 for the weekend. Free shuttle bus service is provided from the Croton-Harmon train station.  BY THE WAY</p>
