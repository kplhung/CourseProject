        <p>Editorial finds US's pledge of $430 million over four years, already $200 million in arrears, to multilateral Global Environment Facility for habitat protection seems rather shameful in view of more determined efforts by private groups like Conservation International, Nature Conservancy and Global Environment Facility, which have fewer resources</p>

        <p>A few weeks ago, the Nature Conservancy announced that it would spend $37 million to buy a remote Pacific atoll from a Honolulu family that had owned it for 80 years. The atoll, Palmyra, seemed an uninviting place, 1,052 miles from Hawaii and largely inaccessible except by small plane. With 15 feet of rainfall a year, Palmyra has only 680 habitable acres at high tide. But the conservancy decided to make the atoll the single most costly purchase in its 49-year history for all the reasons that conservation groups do these things. Palmyra  not only is one of the most pristine places left in the tropical Pacific. It also shelters the world's largest land invertebrate, the coconut crab, nourishes tropical trees that have vanished elsewhere and, at a time when most of the world's coral reefs are under siege, encompasses 15,512 acres of healthy reefs with an astonishing variety of aquatic life.</p>
        <p>In sum, Palmyra is an irreplaceable biological asset. It is also the most recent example of  the increasing emphasis that American-based conservation organizations are placing on acquiring land in remote areas with the sole purpose of protecting biodiversity, either by buying it outright or persuading governments to set it aside. Development, logging, population growth and farming are chewing up more and more unspoiled land every year.</p>

        <p>A few weeks ago, the Nature Conservancy announced that it would spend $37 million to buy a remote Pacific atoll from a Honolulu family that had owned it for 80 years. The atoll, Palmyra, seemed an uninviting place, 1,052 miles from Hawaii and largely inaccessible except by small plane. With 15 feet of rainfall a year, Palmyra has only 680 habitable acres at high tide. But the conservancy decided to make the atoll the single most costly purchase in its 49-year history for all the reasons that conservation groups do these things. Palmyra  not only is one of the most pristine places left in the tropical Pacific. It also shelters the world's largest land invertebrate, the coconut crab, nourishes tropical trees that have vanished elsewhere and, at a time when most of the world's coral reefs are under siege, encompasses 15,512 acres of healthy reefs with an astonishing variety of aquatic life.</p>
        <p>In sum, Palmyra is an irreplaceable biological asset. It is also the most recent example of  the increasing emphasis that American-based conservation organizations are placing on acquiring land in remote areas with the sole purpose of protecting biodiversity, either by buying it outright or persuading governments to set it aside. Development, logging, population growth and farming are chewing up more and more unspoiled land every year.</p>
        <p>To scientists, habitat protection is thus a matter of great urgency. But it is also an attainable objective, daunting as it seems. Russell Mittermeyer, the president of Conservation International -- the newest and one of the most aggressive players on the international scene -- estimates that about 60 percent of the world's biodiversity is contained in less than 5 percent of the world's land mass, and that much of this land can be had for an average of $10 an acre. Just two months ago, for example, Conservation International established a trust fund to underwrite a project announced last year to help Suriname, a small South American country, manage four million acres of untouched tropical forests that Asian timber interests had tried to buy. The total one-time cost was $16 million  to $18 million, or little more than $4 an acre.</p>
        <p>Because of its proximity, biological resources and the inattentiveness of many of its governments, South America has commanded more attention than other continents. In addition to vigorous efforts by nearly every American conservation group to stop the burning of the Amazon rain forest, the Nature Conservancy and Conservation International have both recently acquired large tracts of land in Brazil's Pantanal, a huge wetland south of the Amazon that straddles the border of Paraguay.</p>
        <p>But other, less visible conservation efforts are taking place farther afield. The World Wildlife Federation, which has been in the overseas conservation business longer than any other American organization, is nearing agreement with the Sakha republic in Siberia to place 170 million acres of Siberian forest under protection, with the government of Bhutan in the eastern Himalayas to protect nearly 6,000 square miles, and with various central African countries to establish protected wildlife ''corridors.'' Conservation International has recently begun talks with the Cambodian government to set aside a large forested area that was once the stronghold of the Khmer Rouge.</p>
        <p>As these examples suggest, there are other conservation strategies besides the outright purchase of land. In Bolivia, for example, the Nature Conservancy is training people to manage the Mercado National Park. In the same country, Conservation International bought the development rights to 100,000 acres of land next to Madidi National Park, and then gave the land to the government.</p>
        <p>The fact that private groups like these are doing so much simply highlights the fact that the American government could do more. One of the few tangible achievements of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro was to strengthen the nascent Global Environment Facility, a multilateral body that has helped underwrite some of these private efforts to help poor countries hang on to their natural assets. In 1998, the United States Congress pledged to give this group $430 million over four years. It is already $200 million in arrears, a rather shameful record given the commitment of private groups with fewer resources.</p>
