        <p>Bruce Springsteen may be opening a 10-night stand at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan tomorrow night, but his roots are still on the west side of the Hudson River, where two fans will be leading tours.</p>
        <p>Stan Goldstein and Jean Mikle are betting that people from out of the area would like to see Madam Marie's, Flamingo Lane, ''that giant Exxon sign'' and many more spots in and around Asbury Park.</p>
        <p>''I'm proud of the musical history and heritage of the Jersey Shore and I love to show it off to people,'' Ms. Mikle said.</p>
        <p>Participants can see the places where the Student Prince and Upstage Club, predecessors to the Stone Pony, were located. The tour will also go to Freehold, where Mr. Springsteen attended school.</p>
        <p>Fans will need their own transportation between the towns for the free tour, which starts at 12:30 p.m. next Sunday and at 1 p.m. on June 25 and an as-yet-undetermined time on June 30 at Fifth and Ocean Avenues in Asbury Park.</p>
