        <p>If you ask Arthur J. Kremer the No. 1 reason why ''the structure crumbled'' in Nassau County, Mr. Kremer, a former state Assemblyman, will tell you it is that Nassau did not have a legislature until four years ago.</p>
        <p>In Westchester County, establishment of a such a body in 1970 is widely credited as a big reason that government is now in good financial shape.</p>
        <p>''No doubt, the closer you get to one person one vote, the more effective you can govern,'' said Stephen P. Tenore, a Republican lawmaker for 11 years in Westchester and the former chairman of the county's Board of Legislators.</p>
        <p>Under Nassau's old Board of Supervisors system, one representative each came from the cities of Long Beach and Glen Cove and from the towns of Oyster Bay and North Hempstead. Two came from the more populous town of Hempstead. A weighted voting system kept Democrats from ruling the body and kept the two sides deadlocked in the final years.</p>
        <p>''The board was made up of town supervisors who really didn't care much about county government except to make sure they got their share of the pie,'' said Mr. Kremer, a Democrat.</p>
        <p>He said that even when the new 19-member Legislature took over, it ''needed two to three years to find out what was going on, and they were in no position to find out the depth of the problems until recently.''</p>
        <p>Westchester abandoned its Board of Supervisors for a legislature 26 years sooner than Nassau because its board was not working well, and the legislature ''never let the budget go out of shape,'' said Herman D. Geist, a Republican and the first chairman of the legislature.</p>
        <p>While the legislature in Westchester kept a check on the executive, Nassau suffered ''from a lack of a strong county government in terms of planning, environmental protection, industrial development,'' said Bruce Nyman, a former Democratic member of the Board of Supervisors and of the county legislature.</p>
        <p>David Liebschutz, an adjunct professor at Rockefeller College at the State University at Albany, said that even now, politics has kept the still-inexperienced legislature in Nassau from forming a consensus with the executive on how to pull the county out of its current mess. The alternative may yet be a fiscal oversight board to shoulder the tough decisions -- and share in any political blame.</p>
