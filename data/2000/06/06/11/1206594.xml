        <p>When President Clinton moved from Portugal to Germany to Russia to Ukraine on his European tour, he tried to dispel the notion of the United States as a global bully. In Aachen, Germany, he said that if it hadn't been for Europe, ''there never would have been an America in the first place.'' In Moscow, he promised that the United States would never dictate to Russia how it should behave.</p>
        <p>But he has learned the hard way that Europeans don't like it when America fails to lead on critical issues -- as it failed, for example, early in the Bosnia war. So even as Mr. Clinton laced his oratory with humility, he was also telling his audiences precisely what America wanted them to do -- in trade, in defense, in nuclear security and, in the cases of Russia and Ukraine, in political and economic reform.</p>

        <p>Indeed, one thing Americans were telling others to do was to underwrite most of the cost of the major arms control achievement of the Clinton trip: an agreement for the United States and Russia to each dispose of 34 metric tons of their surplus weapons-grade plutonium. Only a small fraction of the $5.75 billion cost has been raised and unless other countries contribute, the agreement will not be implemented.</p>
