        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>One night out around the city puts the lie to Mr. Ratliff's thesis. I recently spent an evening at the Smoke cafe, another at the Flushing Town Hall and an afternoon with the First Presbyterian Jazz Society in Mt. Vernon, N.Y., seeing Harold Mabern &amp; Co., the Winard Harper Quintet and Jimmy Heath. How surprised these musicians would be to learn that soloing is out! They were magnificent. I am a 34-year attendee of Jazz Mobile and I have been a devoted listener to jazz since the mid-40's. I see no diminution of the solo as the linchpin of creative artistic expression in jazz. It is true, in looking back, that the 50's was a ''golden age'' for small-group jazz; but for anyone listening to the wonderful sounds in jazz today, the proposition that soloing is passe has to be coming from someone who has an iron eardrum.</p>
