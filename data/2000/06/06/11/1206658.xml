        <p>Down a narrow lane near the western outskirts of this city, wood-framed country houses and arching trees impart a rural feel, giving no hint that nearby is a place where a special kind of intellectual intensity rules the day.</p>
        <p>But past a park can be seen the functional beige buildings of Ner Israel Rabbinical College, where the study hall reverberates with the voices of scores of young Orthodox men, debating one-on-one, across tables stacked high with books of Jewish law and tradition. It is an activity that occupies students here morning, afternoon and evening, Sundays through Fridays, before the start of the Jewish sabbath.</p>
        <p>''The goal is not how much ground you cover,'' explained Isaac Greenberg, 21, a pile of well-thumbed texts at his elbow, ''but how you understand it and how you incorporate it in your life.''</p>
        <p>Such a scene would have been a staple of Eastern European Jewish life a century ago, when yeshivas -- traditional academies for the study of Judaism's authoritative texts -- flourished. But rather than reflecting the past, what is happening here is part of a growing trend within Orthodox Judaism's right wing, its most rigorously traditional sector.</p>
        <p>The number of collegiate and graduate students pursuing religious studies in these all-male institutions ''has probably almost doubled'' since 1980, to about 18,000 nationwide, writes William B. Helmreich in a new edition of his book ''The World of the Yeshiva'' (Ktav Publishing House, 2000).</p>
        <p>Mr. Helmreich, who teaches sociology at City College of New York and the City University Graduate Center, said in an interview that the growth is primarily because of a high birthrate among the strictly Orthodox, and greater economic prosperity that allows them to provide more financial support to these institutions.</p>
        <p>The Orthodox account for about 7 percent of the nation's 5.5 million Jews, but within that area of Judaism, a shift has been occurring. As yeshiva enrollments have grown, so, too, has the religious influence of the right wing -- at the expense of Orthodoxy's once dominant modern wing, which holds that Jews can be fully observant and highly involved in wider American society.</p>
        <p>While modern Orthodox young people have become doctors, lawyers and other white-collar professionals, sociologists like Mr. Helmreich say, the right wing has been turning out a high number of rabbis and religious-school teachers, who in turn help shape the religious lives of many in Orthodoxy's next generation.</p>
        <p>At Ner Israel, many people see growth around them.</p>
        <p>Yaakov Feinstein, 26, of New York City, a student of Talmudic law, said he has seen the college add a dormitory and faculty housing over the past dozen years.</p>
        <p>''I think it's more than Ner Israel, I think the total community is growing,'' Mr. Feinstein said.</p>
        <p>As for the college, he said, ''We're really here to be God-fearing Jews.''</p>
        <p>Ner Israel was founded in Baltimore in 1933 by Rabbi Jacob I. Ruderman, a Lithuanian immigrant, who began with 15 students. Now, 800 boys and young men attend the high school, collegiate and graduate programs. The college's enrollment has grown by 50 percent since 1985.</p>
        <p>Among yeshivas, Ner Israel is unusual in that it has always allowed students access to secular, professional education. The college is accredited by the state of Maryland and has agreements with public and private universities at which its students can major in law, business and other subjects.</p>
        <p>The roster of recent alumni includes bankers, accountants and psychologists -- as well as rabbis and religious-school teachers, who college officials say make up 50 percent of graduates.</p>
        <p>Ner Israel's mission statement makes clear its priority is religious studies. Students pursuing secular degrees are asked to limit their work to nights or summer. The college's purpose, the statement says, is to preserve ''a rareified environment'' for dedication to ''intense Torah study.''</p>
        <p>At the heart of that study is chavrusa, students working in pairs, each young man selecting a partner based on intellectual and social compatibility. In the daily debate over religious texts lies educational growth, college officials say.</p>
        <p>How long do they spend in this kind of study? ''I'd say you've got to figure eight hours a day, at least on average,'' said Rabbi Ezra Neuberger, dean of the graduate school. ''The more diligent would be a lot more.''</p>
        <p>Down the hill from the academic buildings is a residential area called Yeshiva Lane, where modestly dressed women with head coverings supervise flocks of children outside the six-bedroom town houses and three-bedroom apartments, built for faculty and graduate students.</p>
        <p>The sight suggests a self-contained community, but the college has built ties to Orthodox Jews worldwide. Since the revolution in Iran two decades ago, it has taken in Iranian Jewish refugees. Nearly 50 study here now, said one of their rabbis, who asked not to be named out of concern for relatives in Iran.</p>
        <p>But there are others from overseas, too. ''There are a lot of South Americans here, a lot of Europeans, a lot of Australians,'' said Rafael Mael, 20, of Baltimore. ''I've roomed with people from Chile and Panama.''</p>
        <p>A person who has helped foster ties to Latin American communities is Moshe Filler, 34, who came from Mexico City and enrolled in Ner Israel to study as a teacher some years ago. Now he runs programs that bring young Latin American Jews to study for the summer on campus, while maintaining the college's links with Jewish communities in Bolivia, Costa Rica, Peru and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''This has become like a center for all these communities,'' Mr. Filler said.</p>
        <p>His job involves considerable travel. ''Last week I was in Chile,'' he said. ''Today, I go to Guatemala.''</p>
        <p>Tuition at Ner Israel is $9,000 a year, but only a minority of students pay full fare. The college considers its applicants first, then finds out if those it accepts can pay, said Rabbi Herman N. Neuberger, the president. ''We feel we do make a contribution to the spiritual life of America through training of our young men,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many students have come here from Orthodox day schools. But some have taken a different route.</p>
        <p>Among the latter is Gil Neuman, 31, who arrived in October after two years' study in Israel. Before that, he  worked in Hollywood, producing and writing films.</p>
        <p>But his life changed one Friday evening when he attended a Sabbath dinner at the home of a Ner Israel graduate, where, he said, he was deeply impressed with the religious lives of those he met.</p>
        <p>''People had a sense of purpose and a sense of meaning that nobody has in today's world,'' Mr. Neuman said.</p>
