        <p>I WAS amused -- you might be, too -- by the news that many designers have included hot pants in their last two collections, in other words, as part of the selection that is in stores now and will be again in late August and September. Ralph Lauren is making them in glen plaid; Stella McCartney is making them for Chloe in frayed white denim with a white lacy ruffle. Dolce &amp; Gabbana expressed themselves in vinyl and chains; Richard Tyler, in a rather soignee sea-green knit. Not to mention the ones by Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton, or Donatella Versace for both her Versace and her Versus collections, or those made by Randolph Duke, Bottega Veneta, Emporio Armani or Betsey Johnson.</p>
        <p>You might be surprised to learn how well hot pants have been selling. Within the last two and a half weeks of May, for example, Bloomingdale's sold 4,757 pairs of hot pants by Polo and Guess. That figure doesn't include the pale brown suede ones made by Chanel ($880) or BCBG (with side stitching, $114), or the ripped denim ones with green rhinestones for Bloomingdale's own label ($132), or the red or pink or blue python pleather ones by Xoxo ($32).</p>

        <p>You might be surprised to learn how well hot pants have been selling. Within the last two and a half weeks of May, for example, Bloomingdale's sold 4,757 pairs of hot pants by Polo and Guess. That figure doesn't include the pale brown suede ones made by Chanel ($880) or BCBG (with side stitching, $114), or the ripped denim ones with green rhinestones for Bloomingdale's own label ($132), or the red or pink or blue python pleather ones by Xoxo ($32).</p>
        <p>''Obviously there's a . . . ,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice president for fashion direction at Bloomingdale's, searching for the right word. ''There's a need for hot pants.''</p>
        <p>''When miniskirts begin to look tacky, I guess,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruttenstein, whom I visited in his office after visiting with the hot pants in his store and in the windows on Third Avenue, was wearing a  black ''Living la Vida Loca'' T-shirt.</p>
        <p>He was working at Lord &amp; Taylor when hot pants first appeared, 29 years ago. ''We had them in velveteen, from Mr. Pants,'' he recalled fondly. ''We set up a hot pants bar, where we sold them with bubble shirts.''</p>
        <p>It was January of 1971, and hot pants arrived in the wake of the ill-fated midi -- a fashion Edsel that languished on department store racks. Hot pants were created not by designers, but by European boutique owners; designers like Yves Saint Laurent quickly included them in their own collections.</p>
        <p>''We'd been showing all these little pants,'' remembered June Weir, who was fashion editor and vice president of Women's Wear Daily at the time, ''and John, meaning John Fairchild, said, 'I've got it -- we're going to call them hot pants.' Things just hit him like that, and we'd all say, 'Oh John, that's marvelous.' ''</p>
        <p>Hot pants came in satin and velvet and leather, even fur. ''We have a fur pair in our museum,'' Valerie Steele, the chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, said proudly. There were bridal hot pants and black-tie hot pants, and hot pants appliqued with a sterno can on the bottom. Women -- even women over 30, it was reported -- wore hot pants with tights and boots and long coats. Alexander's sold 1,500 pairs in one week, Ellen Melinkoff wrote in ''What We Wore'' (William Morrow, 1984).</p>
        <p>By summer, hot pants had vanished (except from the wardrobes of prostitutes and female Nascar enthusiasts). ''They stayed long enough for us to have our picture taken in them,'' Ms. Melinkoff wrote.</p>
        <p>The sex factor, the outreness of hot pants, seemed negligible, subsumed by the giddy novelty of wearing the things. Now, they seem like a gag, a whoopee cushion from fashion's prop closet, ripe for an exhumation, and a giggle. Covering the European collections for The New York Times in January 1971, Bernadine Morris wrote: ''What are the designers going to pick when they revive the 1970's? Shorts, maybe. In the old days they never left the beach or the backyard, except in Busby Berkeley musicals, when they tapped. Now they're all dressed up with tailored jackets or coats, and they're ready to go out to lunch or dinner. That's progress for you. Maybe the restaurateurs in New York will provide the protest.''</p>
        <p>Restaurateurs and fashion ladies had famously come to blows in the 1960's, when women like Happy Rockefeller, Bess Myerson and Nan Kempner were turned away from restaurants for wearing pantsuits (by Courreges or Saint Laurent).</p>
        <p>''I remember it so well,'' Mrs. Kempner said the other day. ''Tommy and I arrived for a dinner party at La Cote Basque -- maybe it was 1965 or '66 -- and I was wearing Yves Saint Laurent, of course -- a pantsuit in black satin with a longish tunic and a belt with a long fringe. Wonderful! Madame Henriette was at the door, a real martinet. Anyway, she looked at me and said, 'You can't wear that, you know.' And I said, 'You only give me one alternative!' Thank God my legs were tanned. And I unzipped my pants and handed them to Tommy, and that was the birth of the mini. Of course I sat down and had to make this diaper out of napkins.''</p>
        <p>A diaper? ''I was wearing my summer underwear,'' she explained. ''I'm wearing them now -- meaning I give them up, as an economy.''</p>
        <p>She said that half a dozen years later nobody made much of a fuss over her hot pants. She owned sequined ones and a blue pair from Dior that she wore with a red shirt. ''I just remember them being fun,'' she said, ''and getting my picture taken -- the barrage of photographers -- which I adored, of course.''</p>
        <p>The more things change, the more they stay the same. You cannot wear your new milennial Chanel, Chloe or Vuitton hot pants to the Carlyle Restaurant, ''21'' or Le Cirque; the dress code at these establishments forbids shorts of any kind. They are welcome, however, at the Four Seasons.</p>
        <p>Hot pants closed the wild chapter in fashion history. By July of 1971, Diana Vreeland, who had been rebel fashion's most enthusiastic promoter, had been fired from Vogue, and the grown-ups took the keys to the prop closet.</p>
        <p>''God, it was so much fun before,'' Mrs. Kempner said. ''I worked at Harper's Bazaar in the late 60's and Tommy used to drive me to work. He'd say, 'Who are we today?' Because it could be anybody: Pocohantas, or Anne Miller in my tap pants.''</p>
        <p>After hot pants, clothes became more comfortable, and more boring. Designers like Calvin Klein got famous for making blue jeans and underpants, the kind you wear under your clothes.</p>
        <p>''Bloody hell, I don't know why I did them,'' said Stella McCartney on the phone from her studio in the Chloe offices in Paris. It was difficult to hear her over the roar of Jimi Hendrix. Ms. McCartney, who is 27, makes the sort of clothes that Jimi Hendrix would be proud to wear, if he were alive and female. She was patient and obliging.</p>
        <p>''Why hot pants? Why not?'' she said. ''I remember I was thinking about mixing different fabrics, graphic prints and soft porn images of women, and trying not to have any sense of what was tasteful, and then I was interested in doing all-over embroidery -- could I do that, you know, would it work? It was about the fringes and letting them hang like scarves. And that got me to the cotton with the lace inlay, and those threads hanging. It was very much a do-it-yourself thing -- if you fancy taking a T-shirt and customizing it, or sewing up a hole in the jeans. Or if you're really cool, you could just go to a flea market. Of course I shouldn't say that. I don't think I answered your question.''</p>
