        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding the Somers pool referendum: Somers has Reis Park, a teen center, many youth sports programs, numerous churches, adult recreation programs, central schools and many lake associations, which  already provide a sense of community in Somers. The lake associations (Lake Lincolndale, Valley Pond, Dean's Pond and Lake Purdy) have been teaching children to swim and have provided social and recreational opportunities for Somers residents since the 1920's. Each association is open to any Somers resident for a fee, which is roughly one-half of the proposed town pool membership fee.  In addition, these associations are not tax supported.</p>

        <p>If you live in a lake community, it is critical that you vote no on this referendum. If you don't live in a lake community, please join us for swimming, fishing, family picnics, holiday parties, ice skating and a sense of community.</p>
