        <p>EIGHT and a half months after he first walked through the doors of Lincoln High School here, Horace Williams, the principal, still has Texas license plates on his car. His daughters want to move back to Houston, and his wife will probably leave their Yonkers apartment to go with them, he said. But Mr. Williams's future is uncertain.</p>
        <p>He arrived, hand picked by the district's superintendent, Andre J. Hornsby, to make drastic changes in the faltering school and he has. Where the hallways were once clogged with students who wouldn't go to class, they are now nearly serene. Scores improved dramatically on the English Regents exam after only six months. And this year's college-bound graduates will receive $624,000 in scholarship money -- more than double what last year's graduates received.</p>
        <p>But Lincoln still has a long way to go before state officials remove it from their list of troubled schools, known as SURR (for Schools Under Registration Review). The first official review will be late this summer, and by then Mr. Williams may be gone. For in his mind, he is tied to Dr. Hornsby, who brought him to Yonkers and is himself struggling to hold on in the face of a $34 million school budget deficit looming for next year.</p>
        <p>''If he goes, I go,'' Mr. Williams said bluntly. ''If the board does not support the superintendent, then there is no need in my trying to carry forth the goals to make the school better. I'm unorthodox in some of my methods, and I'm not sure a new superintedent would support me.''</p>
        <p>The gaping budget hole is the result of a bruising power struggle between Dr. Hornsby and Mayor John D. Spencer. Dr. Hornsby said he was counting on money that would have come from pursuing a federal desegregation lawsuit, but the mayor has directed the school board -- which he appoints -- to vote against the suit, thwarting Dr. Hornsby's plans.</p>
        <p>Yonkers must now cut 800 school employees and exactly the type of special programs Mr. Williams says a struggling school needs to get on its feet. The extra social workers, guidance counselors and Saturday classes for students who needed extra help this year will all go.</p>
        <p>''For any principal in any SURR school to be effective there's got to be a commitment, and if I have to cut staff, that will devastate this school's programs and the direction it needs to go,'' he said. ''I'm not a masochist. If the district cannot commit to programs necessary to change, there's no point in me even attempting to salvage something that's unsalvageable.''</p>
        <p>Others might wonder about Mr. Williams's own commitment to Yonkers, considering the Texas plates on his car and the many remarks he has made suggesting that it doesn't matter who leads Lincoln -- that change, ultimately, is up to the teachers. But he vacillates, also insisting that the school cannot take much more disruption.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams came to Yonkers with a one-year contract. But even the head of the teachers' union, Steve Frey, who has had lukewarm relations with the principal -- at best -- said he would rather see Mr. Williams stay than start all over again with a new team of administrators.</p>
        <p>''You can't turn a school around in a year,'' Mr. Frey said. ''It's going to take several years of stability. And right now there's none. There's just this atmosphere of the unknown and that's not good for anyone.''</p>
        <p>At least 15 teachers have applied for transfers out of Lincoln next year, an unusually high number, he said.</p>
        <p>Of course, no matter who goes, the students will still be there. And in Lincoln's vast cafeteria, all had something to say about the changes at their school this year.</p>
        <p>''We get all this money for computers that don't work, and the textbooks are falling apart,'' said Jeffrey Parker, 17, leafing through a friend's dog-eared copy of Dante's ''Inferno'' and pointing upward to the ceiling where chunks had fallen down. ''Look at this lunchroom!''</p>
        <p>Jeffrey's friend, Steven Heyden, said, ''I've seen a lot of changes, none for the better.'' Dr. Hornsby's constant trumpeting of his success in bringing new computers to every school particularly infuriates him. ''Window dressing,'' Steven scoffed. ''None of the computers work! They're never on, or they won't let us use them. If there's a substitute, we get to play solitaire.''</p>
        <p>Even worse, he said, for most of the year four classes had no designated teacher at all. Mr. Williams attributed the problem to teachers' lengthy illnesses, but insisted this was no excuse for students to do poorly.</p>
        <p>Until recently, George Cuellar's United States history class was one of them, and the 16-year-old junior fears that he is unprepared to take the Regents history exam. ''They just gave us crossword puzzles and stuff to do,'' he said of the substitutes.</p>
        <p>Other students, however, were just as eager to say good things.</p>
        <p>''There was a lot of conflict at first,'' said Chantale Rabbah, 18, this year's valedictorian. ''We weren't used to them and they weren't used to the students, but now we consider the administration our friends and they've been really helpful. I'm mad because I know it's too late for me, and if they stay next year will be a lot better.''</p>
        <p>David Shane, a big 16-year-old, had just been sternly reprimanded by one of the new team for breaking a window while roughhousing with a friend.</p>
        <p>Still, he said: ''I really want them to stay. I just want it known about Lincoln that we can get by this.''</p>
        <p>Teva DeGree, 16, has already seen the benefits of Mr. Williams's approach. ''All my grades went up from 60's and 70's last year to 80's and 90's this year,'' she said as she braided a friend's hair. The reason was simple: Mr. Williams's crackdown on hall loiterers -- suspending those who come late to class -- made the difference.</p>
        <p>''It made me go to class,'' she said. ''If you're going to go sit in class, you might as well learn.''</p>
        <p>Catalina Chavez, 17, sitting with friends, smiled as she considered her school's bad-boy reputation and the reality she sees.</p>
        <p>''There are some kids here that actually go to school and actually learn,'' she said. ''They're trying to go to college. The staff is great, to tell you the truth.''</p>
        <p>Catalina has been so motivated by her chemistry teacher, a 30-year veteran of the school, that she does work for his class nearly every free moment.</p>
        <p>''He'll call you at home and be like, 'Are you doing your work?' He really wants everyone to pass,'' she said.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Williams's major efforts this year was removing students who could not function in a traditional environment and sending them to an alternative program. It has created a noticeable change in the hallways at Lincoln and most students said that as uncomfortable as it was at first, their school has eased into a routine they can embrace.</p>
        <p>Sarah Martinez, who is on her way to a pre-law program at Morgan State University this fall, believes no one outside Lincoln understands just how far the school has come.</p>
        <p>''There was a lot thrown at us at the beginning of the year,'' she said, ''but we've come a long way since then, and we've settled down since then, and that needs to be recognized.''</p>
        <p>Corey Byrd, a sophomore, could not quite articulate his pride in Lincoln, but he carries his drum major's baton with him everywhere. Libbie Lederno, 18, reported that Lincoln students had raised more than $1,000 for the Make-a-Wish Foundation.</p>
        <p>Emmanuel Tejada, a gangly, soft-spoken 18-year-old said, almost in a whisper: ''This was the first year I passed the Regents Competency Tests. I had a lot of extra help after school and on Saturday.''</p>
        <p>The smaller study groups -- hallmarks of Mr. Williams's tenure -- had been essential, he said.</p>
        <p>''We like the administration,'' said Shaconda Pinckney, a junior. ''They're doing their job.'' She singled out for special praise an assistant principal who had taken a group of 30 students on a tour of traditionally black colleges during Easter break. ''A lot of people that didn't want to go to college and just wanted to have fun went on the tour,'' Shaconda said. ''But now they've seen and they're like, 'I want to go, I want to go.' ''</p>
        <p>This year has been especially successful in terms of college admissions. At last count, 108 acceptance letters were posted outside the guidance office, and counselors have been getting a hand from the federally financed Academic Talent Search Program based at Fordham University, which helps low-income students and those who are the first generation to go to college.</p>
        <p>Daniel Diaz, a Talent Search counselor who was assigned to Lincoln this year, said the changes there have been striking.</p>
        <p>''At the beginning of the year the kids weren't focusing,'' he said. ''There were a lot of fights going on. It was pretty crazy here. The administration has done a great job -- they're turning around the attitude that the kids have. It's a big difference.''</p>
        <p>That may be true, but Mr. Williams said he has not even begun to impose the kind of changes he would like for Lincoln. That will come next year -- assuming that he is there, which is looking less and less likely.</p>
        <p>''I'll be honest,'' he said. ''The school cannot take a wholesale change of administration again. That would be devastating to the kids and to the district. Should I not be here, I would hope the staff would step up and the parents would step up. Sometimes change is good.''</p>
        <p>Remaking Lincoln</p>
        <p>The is the third article of a series examining efforts to turn around Lincoln High School in Yonkers, which the state has threatened to close if it does not show dramatic improvement. The first article, on March 12, focused on the tactics adopted by top administrators to change the school's culture. The second, on April 23, looked at an assistant principal, Shango Blake, and his efforts to reach out to struggling students.</p>
