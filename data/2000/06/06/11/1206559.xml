        <p>For nearly a quarter of a century, members of the Snug Harbor Bridge Club have been playing cards in a meeting room at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center. Now they are on the verge of being ousted, on the grounds that card playing does not qualify as a cultural activity.</p>
        <p>''We need the space for arts groups and artists,'' Susan Robinson, the center's executive director, said of the decision not to renew the club's annual lease when it expires in August. ''That is our mandate.'' The center plans to use the room to expand the quarters of an arts education program that serves 10,000 students a year.</p>
        <p>Currently, the bridge club has exclusive use of the room, where it holds 10 games throughout the week for about 150 members. The club pays $1,000 a month in rent.</p>
        <p>Michael Gecht, a club member, pointed out that in the past the center used the rent payments to help it through some lean financial times.  ''We were here when they needed us,'' he said. ''There should be some loyalty.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Robinson, who was hired seven months ago, disagrees. She pointed out that the club's rent makes up just a tiny fraction of the center's $2.6 million annual budget, which is provided largely by the city's Department of Cultural Affairs.</p>
        <p>''The Department of Cultural Affairs is very upset that they are subsidizing a bridge club when their mandate, and ours, is to support arts organizations,'' Ms. Robinson said.</p>
        <p>The department agrees with this position. ''We absolutely support Snug Harbor's right to make these spaces available to arts groups,'' said Susan Rothschild, an agency spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>The club's president, Sharon McCarty, contends that playing bridge takes intellectual nimbleness and therefore fits the definition of a cultural activity. And she has discovered that finding alternative space is not easy.</p>
        <p>''Many of our players are senior citizens,'' Ms. McCarty said. ''So we need a place with good parking and handicapped facilities.''</p>
        <p>She plans to ask the center if it can make available another building on its 124-acre campus. But Ms. Robinson said that many buildings on the site were yet to be renovated and she did not have the room. In any case, she does not believe that a bridge club fits with the center's arts-related mission. ''Cultural center doesn't mean community center,'' she said.</p>
