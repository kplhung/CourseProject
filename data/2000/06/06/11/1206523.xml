        <p>Joan Johnson, the Islip Town Clerk, and Representative Rick Lazio have some history together. She introduced him when he announced his first run for Congress in 1992 and again last month when he announced he was jumping into the Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton. And now, she wants to replace him in the Second Congressional District.</p>
        <p>The Suffolk County Republican Committee chose her as the Republican nominee last week after Islip's  Town Supervisor, Peter McGowan,  decided against entering the race.</p>
        <p>A former Human Service Administrator for the Town of Islip, Ms. Johnson, 66, was appointed Town Clerk in 1991 and has won re-election to the position five times. She won 68 percent of the vote in the last election in 1999. Political analysts said that Ms. Johnson's nomination was likely aimed at attracting minority voters who often support Democrats. If elected, she would become Long Island's first black congresswoman.</p>
        <p>On the Democratic side, the county committee voted last week not to designate a nominee after Babylon's  Supervisor, Richard Schaffer, a favorite among local and national Democratic leaders, decided not to enter the race. Two other prominent Democrats -- David A. Bishop, the Suffolk County Legislature's minority leader, and Steven J. Israel, the Huntington Town Board's majority leader -- have since announced their plans to run for the nomination in a Sept. 12 primary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop, 35, is a lawyer who was first elected to the legislature in 1993. He is chairman of the legislature's Public Safety Committee, which oversees the Police Department and county jails. Mr. Israel, 42, was first elected to the Huntington Town Board in 1993. He served as a legislative aide to Representative Richard L. Ottinger, from Westchester, in the early 1980's and as an assistant Suffolk County Executive in the late 1980's. He runs a public relations and marketing company.</p>
