        <p>Just a short time ago, it was perfectly acceptable to pass yourself off as a technophobe; in fact, for many, it was a matter of pride. Technophobia ruled. Nobody but geeks and early-adopter oddballs used computers for anything more than typing. Just owning a cell phone, never mind talking on it in public, was an invitation to be called a jerk. In the early 1990's, even Luddites briefly had their day again, whipping up fears about how computers would run our lives, wrecking the possibilities for human intimacy and making the future a mean, dismal place.</p>
        <p>Somewhere along the way, however, all that doom and gloom drifted out to sea, pushed away not by blue-sky idealism but by a temperate, practical faith in the idea that machines are nothing to be afraid of, that we can use them when, where and how we want to use them and that technology might actually improve our lives.</p>

        <p>Just a short time ago, it was perfectly acceptable to pass yourself off as a technophobe; in fact, for many, it was a matter of pride. Technophobia ruled. Nobody but geeks and early-adopter oddballs used computers for anything more than typing. Just owning a cell phone, never mind talking on it in public, was an invitation to be called a jerk. In the early 1990's, even Luddites briefly had their day again, whipping up fears about how computers would run our lives, wrecking the possibilities for human intimacy and making the future a mean, dismal place.</p>
        <p>Somewhere along the way, however, all that doom and gloom drifted out to sea, pushed away not by blue-sky idealism but by a temperate, practical faith in the idea that machines are nothing to be afraid of, that we can use them when, where and how we want to use them and that technology might actually improve our lives.</p>
        <p>In the pages that follow, the magazine looks at dozens of futuristic concepts and devices that will be filtering into the mainstream of American society on or around the year 2010. The date is not totally arbitrary. It allows us to straddle the realms of science fiction and science nonfiction. Ten years out is just near enough to retain a meaningful link to the present (many of the technologies here are well along in the development process), but distant enough to add up to a world that feels different, though not all that different, from the one we live in now.</p>
        <p>We've designed the issue as a catalog, but it's not simply an array of gadgets. By 2010, sophisticated, interactive functions will be knit seamlessly into children's toys and grown-ups' toys, into our kitchens, backyards and every place we go. The catalog format is more than a useful way of organizing this wide range of goods. It's also a metaphor for how technology is evolving these days. It used to seem as if new gadgets were just issued forth from remote R. and D. labs, and we took whatever we got. Now the high-tech possibilities seem limitless and the consumer is suddenly powerful, deciding the shape and feel of the near future. If those machines do end up running our lives, it will only be because we want them to.</p>
