        <p>Set atop a hill in the exclusive Newstead section, overlooking this township's quaint downtown and much of Essex County and New York City beyond, is a 30-acre quarry that resembles a vast, overgrown crater stretching a quarter-mile across. Jagged man-made cliffs rise about 60 feet above a small stream that feeds a shallow pond.</p>
        <p>Deer, chipmunks and other wildlife dart in and out of the bushes and trees that seem to sprout from the rock itself, and hawks soar on the updrafts of the quarry's miniature palisades, level with the back windows of the houses perched on the quarry's perimeter.</p>
        <p>''I hear owls at night, I've seen foxes,'' said Joel Levin, who lives across Underhill Road from the quarry.</p>
        <p>But now 198 housing units are proposed for this area occupied by the abandoned rock quarry, which has been largely reclaimed by nature to form an extraordinary landscape set  in the middle of this densely populated suburb.</p>
        <p>As surreal as this setting may be, opposition to the development -- in the form of the 150-member Coalition to Preserve South Orange is relatively prosaic: traffic would be a nightmare; runoff would be ruinous; the schools would get even more crowded. Nor would Canadian geese stop off here on their seasonal migrations.</p>
        <p>The coalition and its allies want to preserve the quarry as one of the few vestiges of open space in South Orange, a racially and economically diverse township of 16,000 residents whose income levels seem to rise with the topography, from the cracked sidewalks near the Newark border to the manicured lawns surrounding the spacious homes in Newstead.</p>
        <p>In making their case, however, members of the coalition decline to mention the neighboring South Mountain Reservation recreation area, which stretches across five towns in Essex County and includes 2,040 acres of parkland.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the quarry is private property, and is zoned for housing. It was also involved in a 1993 court settlement to satisfy the township's  affordable housing requirement. In a proposed deal stemming from the court settlement, John Gross, the township administrator, said the quarry developer would provide $100,000 to rehabilitate housing in South Orange, and another $480,000 to finance what is known as a regional contribution agreement in which the City of Orange would create 40 units of affordable housing.</p>
        <p>The owner of the disputed property is Gerald Turco, a developer based in Lyndhurst whose family bought the quarry in 1979 with the intent to develop the site. But plans to develop the property were put off after the death of Mr. Turco's mother and then the collapse of the housing market. Consequently, the family continued to operate the quarry until 1989, Mr. Turko said, noting that the gravel used for most of the Continental Airlines Arena parking lot came from there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turco is now under contract to sell the site, for an undisclosed sum, to Trammel Crow Residential, a large developer based in Rockville, Md., contingent on Trammel Crow's receiving site plan approval from the South Orange Planning Board. But Mr. Turco, 43, who grew up in Nutley, said he was still open to other offers, including a deal to preserve the site as open space.</p>
        <p>''Nobody approached me with any figures,'' he said. ''If I get something in my hand I'll respond to it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Turco laughed as he recounted that some of the same people opposing the housing development had fought to shut down the quarry operation. ''I can't win,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Levin of the prservation group said that as open space -- perhaps with the addition of walkways -- the quarry property would be accessible to everyone, whereas housing would merely demand additional police, fire and other township services. In addition, said the 54-year-old neighborhood activist, more housing would mean more children and place a greater demand on the school system, resulting in higher taxes.</p>
        <p>In November, residents voted to tax themselves a total of about $100,000 a year for the purpose of acquiring and preserving open space, joining 116 other municipalities and 17 counties in New Jersey that have adopted similar local levies. Proponents say the open space revenue, combined with matching funds from Essex County and the state's new Garden State Preservation Trust created by Governor Whitman and the Legislature, are obvious sources of money to buy the property, estimated to be worth about $5 million.</p>
        <p>But the quarry, which is peppered with no-tresspassing signs, also presents some problems as publicly owned open space. Its cliffs and rocky terrain are hazardous, and  some clean-up work is needed. Two aging yellow earth movers are parked outside a big metal maintenance shed near the quarry's locked gate. The rusted hulks of a felled crane and a dump truck containing corroded 40-gallon drums litter the middle of the quarry, where the ground is blackened and smells of fuel oil.</p>
        <p>''A big hole like that is certainly going to be a nuisance, because some day somebody is going to get hurt in there,'' said William Calabrese, president of the South Orange Board of Trustees, the township's ruling body. Mr. Calabrese's house on Hoskier Road looks out over the quarry, and he has abstained from voting on any board decisions concerning the site.</p>
        <p>Mr. Calabrese said he liked the open space behind his house, but his comments did seem to reflect what coalition members said was a lack of official enthusiasm for preserving the quarry site.</p>
        <p>''If somebody invests $5 million in a property, they have the right to develop it, or at least get their money out of it,'' Mr. Calabrese said. Preservation of the quarry also faces potentially competing efforts, including plans for a $10 million arts center downtown.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, in March the township applied for $6.6 million in state open space money but did not specify what it might be used for.</p>
        <p>Jeff Tittel, director of the Sierra Club's New Jersey chapter, who has visited the quarry, said it would provide not only badly needed open space, but a fascinating example of the resilience of nature.</p>
        <p>''People forget, if you leave nature alone it will start healing itself,'' Mr. Tittel said. ''Trees are growing, wetlands are forming. It shows all the values of a good piece of open space. The other part is, this is what the community would like to see. They voted to tax themselves to buy this property. That was part of the whole campaign.''</p>
        <p>So far, Trammel Crow has not submitted a site plan application, said the township's lawyer, Edwin R. Matthews, adding that in two informal meetings with local officials in March and April, company representatives outlined a concept involving 198 housing units around a loop road. They would include 58 single-family houses of varying size, 80 town houses and 60 apartments. Six large houses would be for sale, and the rest of the units would be rental properties ranging from $1,800 to $3,000 a month, Mr. Matthews said.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Epstein, a lawyer for Trammel Crow, declined to discuss details of the project.</p>
        <p>''The plan is evolving,'' Mr. Epstein said.</p>
