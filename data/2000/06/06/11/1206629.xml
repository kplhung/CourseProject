        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Here are some sequels to the shoe opera ''Barefoot on Elizabeth Street'' (May 28), in which Ellen Tien describes how a man, ''calm, tallish, 30-ish, stocky, with close-cropped hair,'' mugged her and took $200, a leather jacket and her Guccis.</p>
        <p>Scenario No. 1 (very possible). Mr. Mugger robbed other women of their cash, hats, boots and pashmina shawls and had no trouble selling his loot on the Upper West Side. After several hours of work he had enough money to buy into a group planning to revive ''Barefoot in the Park.''</p>

        <p>Scenario No. 2 (possible). Mr. Mugger took his new girlfriend to dinner that night at a trendy Upper East Side restaurant. Coincidentally, to console Ms. Tien, her husband took her to dinner at the same restaurant. The girlfriend was wearing the jacket and shoes. In the ladies' room the girlfriend told Ms. Tien that she ''loved the jacket,'' but the loafers were ''killing her.''</p>
        <p>Scenario No. 3 (impossible). Ms. Tien called the police and described the incident and Mr. Mugger so that  he might be caught, tried and convicted, sparing others from the same crime.</p>
