        <p>BREAK EVERY RULE</p>
        <p>Essays on Language, Longing,</p>
        <p>and Moments of Desire.</p>
        <p>By Carole Maso.</p>
        <p>Counterpoint, $25.</p>
        <p>At one point in this collection of 10 meditations on her creative processes, the novelist Carole Maso finds that the distinction between living and writing has all but vanished. ''What is this desire to become comprehensible to one's self?'' she asks. ''The temptation, the risk is to assign meaning, motive, cause, in an attempt to feel a little bit better.'' Maso, who teaches English at Brown University, would prefer to resist the lure of linear narrative (and thus the knowable life) by keeping her writing in a mode of ''longing,'' rather than explanation. In other words, dissolving ''thought, memory, sensation'' allows her material to ''become'' an emotional state, she suggests -- not merely to be ''about'' one. To her credit, Maso fully acknowledges the peril of her sojourn along the outer limits of genre. ''One might stop time for awhile,'' she writes, yet ''a series of radiant tableaux are not enough.'' With less optimism but more lyricism than her literary mother, Gertrude Stein -- a lineage she celebrates in a richly allusive essay -- Maso often seems to be embroidering silk onto water; in the wake of her sensory pull, words thread along forceful yet unfixable patterns. And, for the most part, ''Break Every Rule'' maintains this extraordinary level of craft. So it's easy to forgive some of the overwrought self-vigil (''I know I have never been ordinary'') for her moments of truly ''luminous alphabet'': an elegy for ''the hum'' of a musician friend, for instance, or the ethereal portrait of a slumbering woman reawakening to ''the world retrieved.''</p>
