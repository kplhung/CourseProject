        <p>Harvard's men's heavyweight varsity won the 135th rowing of its tradition-steeped race with Yale, beating the Elis in the four-mile upstream Thames River course in Gales Ferry, Conn., by two and a half boat lengths.</p>
        <p>Both crews brought season records that lacked their usual distinction to this encounter, the oldest American intercollegiate athletic event. Harvard finished its regular season by placing fourth at the Eastern sprint championships on May 21. Yale was seventh.</p>

        <p>Harvard's men's heavyweight varsity won the 135th rowing of its tradition-steeped race with Yale, beating the Elis in the four-mile upstream Thames River course in Gales Ferry, Conn., by two and a half boat lengths.</p>
        <p>Both crews brought season records that lacked their usual distinction to this encounter, the oldest American intercollegiate athletic event. Harvard finished its regular season by placing fourth at the Eastern sprint championships on May 21. Yale was seventh.</p>
        <p>The Crimson beat Yale again today, spotting the Elis a three-seat advantage a quarter mile into their four-mile pull before drawing ahead and winning in the wind-aided time of 19 minutes 44.4 seconds, 9.8 seconds ahead of Yale.</p>
        <p>The junior varsity three-mile race developed in a similar fashion, with Yale gaining a six-seat lead, then Harvard chasing Yale down and going in front at the mile mark to win in 15:01.2, 14.5 seconds ahead of its rival.</p>
