        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Jeff Van Gundy should be fired.</p>
        <p>Why? Because the Knicks lost to the Pacers in a series that the Knicks should have won. The Knicks' defeat was the result of Van Gundy's poor coaching.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Jeff Van Gundy should be fired.</p>
        <p>Why? Because the Knicks lost to the Pacers in a series that the Knicks should have won. The Knicks' defeat was the result of Van Gundy's poor coaching.</p>
        <p>Are the Knicks a better team without Ewing in the lineup? The answer is definitely yes, at least against a team like the Pacers.</p>
        <p>Ewing, at age 37, is just a better than average center. Nothing more and nothing less.</p>
        <p>The Knicks were able to defeat the Heat with Ewing in the lineup. And the Knicks would have been better with Ewing against the twin towers of Tim Duncan and David Robinson of the Spurs last year. But he was definitely a liability against the Pacers.</p>
        <p>A good coach should know that one could not use the same lineup and players against every team. But Van Gundy insisted that the Knicks were better against the Pacers with Ewing in the lineup before Game 6, even though the results clearly indicated the opposite. Van Gundy has shown himself to be an inflexible and mediocre coach in game tactics, and does not know how to learn from his mistakes. He has put his own rapport with Ewing above the team.</p>
