        <p>In his quest for the Reform Party's presidential nomination, Patrick J. Buchanan got a major lift when a spokesman for Ross Perot, the party's founder and two-time nominee, said Mr. Perot had all but decided not to seek the nomination this year. That's bad news for Mr. Buchanan's opponents, who fear he will impose his conservative social views on a party that has taken no official position on such issues. John Hagelin of the Natural Law Party, which favors across-the-board government reform, is preparing to fight Mr. Buchanan for the nomination.</p>
