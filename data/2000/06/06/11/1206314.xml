        <p>The great American counterspook, Paul Redmond, left a word-news tip in the dead drop that is my answering machine: ''Check out bundling.''</p>
        <p>Old-timers remember that word fondly from their spooning days. ''Bundling was originally courting in bed,'' noted an 1874 British slang dictionary, ''the lovers being tied or bundled up to prevent undue familiarities. The practice still obtains in Wales.''</p>
        <p>This 1781 term for an early form of what is now called ''safe sex,'' apparently pioneered by the prudent Welsh, was derived from the Old English bindan, ''to bind together,'' and was later applied to ''men and women sleeping together, where the divisions of the house will not permit of better or more decent accommodation, with all their clothes on.''</p>
        <p>Fast-forward to the Arizona Legislature in 1956, which prohibited ''bundling or combining various limited benefit insurance policies.'' The pejorative connotation grew when the Justice Department in 1975 accused I.B.M. of charging anticompetitive prices for bundling hardware and software services. The European Community repeated the complaint in 1981, when John Tagliabue defined the word in The New York Times: ''the practice of what is called bundling -- selling the elements of a computer system as a package to prevent competitors from supplying them at perhaps better conditions.''</p>
        <p>Today the term obtains, to use the archaic verb, in the Microsoft case, as a federal judge ruled that the company illegally bundled its Web browser with its Windows software. In my legal-etymological interpretation, the company is appealing on the grounds that separate divisions wrapped up in bed together, fully clothed, are not making love.</p>
        <p>Thus do old terms find new uses in the brave new wide Web world. The trade name SPAM, for example -- which was created in 1937 by Hormel Foods out of the first and last letters of ''spiced ham'' -- has, when uncapitalized, come to mean ''junk e-mail,'' with a second sense of ''the random posting of advertisements on computer bulletin boards.''</p>
        <p>A fanciful speculation about the metaphoric reason for the adoption of spamming by the computer world can be found in the excellent Newton's Telecom Dictionary, 16th edition: ''the term is derived from a brand of pink, canned meat that splatters messily when hurled.'' (A spokesman for Hormel vociferously denies this, and tests run at the Safire Semantic Kitchens confirm that uncanned SPAM, when hurled against a wall at a normal speed, bounces rather than splatters.)</p>
        <p>Cache, pronounced ''cash,'' from the French verb cacher, ''to hide,'' came to mean ''a hiding place for valuables''; it was especially applied to holes dug to conceal provisions and ammunition. (One reason given by the Pentagon for the U.S. incursion into Cambodia in 1969 was to capture buried arms, causing the Nixon aide Len Garment to ask, ''Can you check a cache?'')</p>
        <p>In usage by the new lingo, information is cached by placing it closer to the user to make it more accessible, which also places less strain on limited computer and network resources. The meaning has changed from the sinister ''hiding place'' to a more positive ''nearby holding place.''</p>
        <p>A cookie originated as a small Dutch cake and became the term for a baked morsel to be passed around after the canapes have been devoured. The metaphoric origin of cookie in computerese is obscure (send speculation to onlanguage@nytimes.com), but its meaning is ''a text file placed on a computer's hard disk by an Internet server to track the client's habits and tastes.'' Marketers say it provides convenience and unexpected choices to clients; privacy guardians warn that a cookie can follow a customer's movements around the Web to create an invasive profile.</p>
        <p>A cookie-pusher was a term coined in World War II to be a derogation of diplomats who attended too many receptions; now it is an exponent of ''targeted marketing.''</p>
        <p>Attendant began as ''one who waits upon or accompanies,'' as in Milton's ''Lest sin Surprise thee, and her black attendant, Death.'' After adoption by airlines of ''flight attendant'' when stewardess was taken as sexist, the word was snapped up by technologists and now has two meanings. The first is ''an inexpensive computer that leans heavily on its connection to more sophisticated computers.''</p>
        <p>The second meaning bothers me. ''An attendant is an operator of a phone system console,'' lexicographer Harry Newton tells me. ''Typically, it's the first person in a company to answer an incoming call. That person attends the phone system; when the company's phone is answered by a machine, that's an automated attendant.''</p>
        <p>What's the matter with operator? My mother was a telephone operator and proud of it. An operator suggests an active, purposeful, hands-on person engaging with a device or system; an attendant is more passive, sometimes just hanging around ''in waiting.'' The machine, or system, that is operated is secondary to the human in charge, but the phone system that is merely attended is the master.</p>
        <p>Hello, Central?</p>
        <p>Of Wimps and Mush</p>
        <p>In an aside (watch out for those asides) in an article last month, I recalled a 1980 headline over an editorial in The Boston Globe that read ''Mush From the Wimp,'' which I presumed a prankster substituted for the cliche ''All Must Share the Burden.'' I am now informed by David Greenway, who retired last month as editor of The Globe's editorial page, that it was not sabotage but a self-inflicted wound.</p>
        <p>''It was the late Kirk Scharfenberg, editorial writer and later editor of the page,'' writes Greenway, ''who wrote 'Mush From the Wimp' over his editorial on President Carter's economic plan. He wrote it as a joke, never thinking that the headline would ever see print.</p>
        <p>''As you know, the copy editors write the headlines,'' continues my colleague Greenway, ''but in this case the copy editors let it through. The night editor caught it in midrun, and the headline was hastily changed to the cliched 'All Must Share the Burden' as a last-minute sub for the rest of the run.''</p>
        <p>Many years later, when Greenway became editor of The Globe's editorial page, the paper criticized animal rights advocates who wanted to close down dog-sled racing in Alaska. The headline chosen for its historic resonance: ''More Wimps for the Mush.''</p>
