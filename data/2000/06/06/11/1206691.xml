        <p>Francoise Durr leaned forward and gave a kiss on each cheek to the player the fans here call Ma-ree Pierce.</p>
        <p>She has been Mary for most of her life. She was raised in the United States by a hard-driving father who had grandiose plans for her tennis career long before she had the chance to make any plans of her own.</p>
        <p>She still lives there and still speaks English like a Floridian a lot more than she speaks French like a Parisian.</p>
        <p>But today, with Durr and the French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, watching from the stands at Roland Garros and millions more French citizens watching on television, Ma-ree got the chance to revel in the other, less burnished half of her identity.</p>
        <p>She did so with a typically powerful, atypically composed performance under extreme pressure. By the time her 6-2, 7-5 victory over Conchita Martinez of Spain was complete, Pierce had put an end to Durr's 33-year vigil. She is no longer the last Frenchwoman to win the French Open.</p>
        <p>''I'm very happy to no longer have that honor,'' Durr said in French. ''I hope Mary will not have to have it so long.''</p>
        <p>When Durr won here in 1967, tennis was still ostensibly an amateur sport -- and Roland Garros was a much smaller, humbler place. But it is a floodlit fishbowl now, and Pierce proved this year that she has learned to adapt.</p>
        <p>In the past, she was often shaky on big occasions and often at odds with the Parisians who have sat and watched her on-court gesticulations and unforced errors with exasperation in recent years.</p>
        <p>Pierce, 25, had a much smoother ride this year, demonstrating a more complete grasp of the game than when she last reached the final here in 1994. And she earned the support, if not quite the adoration, of the French crowd, which cheered her warmly but not wildly from beginning to end.</p>
        <p>''I thought I would never win this tournament,'' Pierce said, fighting her way through tears in her victory speech, delivered -- appropriately for her -- in French and English. ''It was my dream to win it and now it has come true, and it's great for it to happen in front of all of you.''</p>
        <p>It was Pierce's second Grand Slam singles title; she also won the 1995 Australian Open. And it restored her to a place of prominence in the game that she had ceded with the arrival of younger rivals like Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport and the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena.</p>
        <p>''Maybe tomorrow I will know what I did today,'' Pierce said. ''Everything that's happened here in the past, everything that I've been through, there are just so many emotions here that attach to this tournament for me. To win it is amazing.''</p>
        <p>It has indeed been a singular journey. Born in Montreal, she moved to the United States before her first birthday with her French mother, Yannick, and American father, Jim.  Even though Mary did not start playing tennis until she was 10, Jim soon determined that his daughter had the requisite talent. But his often-belligerent behavior prevented the United States Tennis Federation and others from offering Mary assistance as long as he was involved.</p>
        <p>Philippe Chatrier, then the French Tennis Federation president, felt differently. At 13, Pierce came to Paris and lived in a dorm on the Roland Garros grounds for a short time.</p>
        <p>''It was my first time being alone, really, because our family was always together at the time, 24 hours,'' Pierce said today. ''I couldn't really speak French. I didn't know anybody. I didn't have any friends, and I was by myself. It was really tough.''</p>
        <p>At 15, Pierce reached the second round in her first French Open in 1990. Three years later, her father was escorted from the grounds here after getting involved in an altercation with other spectators and was subsequently banned from attending women's tournaments. Jim and Yannick Pierce later separated, and Mary claimed that her father had abused her physically and emotionally, an accusation he denied.</p>
        <p>They have since reconciled. Pierce has practiced with him occasionally this year and made a point of mentioning him in her victory speech today. It was her father who taught her to swing with remarkable force from the baseline, but she is more than a power player now.</p>
        <p>After beating third-seeded Monica Seles in the quarterfinals, she beat the top-ranked Hingis in the semifinals, despite losing the second set after squandering a match point.</p>
        <p>Pierce took control early today, jumping out to a 5-1 lead over the clearly nervous Martinez, the 1994 Wimbledon champion playing in her first French Open final at age 28. The Spaniard began to loosen up and put her varied spins to effective use, jumping out to a 2-0 lead in the second. But Pierce would soon get even, although it would not be until Martinez served in the 11th game that the momentum turned for good.</p>
        <p>Pierce, doing her best to stay aggressive despite the moment, pushed forward with regularity and ended up breaking Martinez's serve with an overhead. All that remained was for Pierce to serve the most important game of her career. It would not be easy. On her first match point, at 40-30, she dumped a forehand in the net after a long rally. On her second, she hit a nervous backhand wide.</p>
        <p>On her third match point, Pierce would find the solution: a powerful first serve up the middle that Martinez mis-hit with her forehand into the net. Both Pierce's arms shot in the air as she wheeled to face her brother and her mother. She was soon holding a microphone in her hand, searching for her words in French and English, with the Suzanne Lenglen Cup glittering nearby.</p>
