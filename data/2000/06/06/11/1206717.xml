        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Few basketball fans have a clue as to what it is like for an athlete to compete with other great athletes when injured. Fans incorrectly assume that injured athletes are no big deal. With rare exceptions, they are clueless as to the pain and frustration such athletes experience.</p>
        <p>What I love about Patrick Ewing is that despite a history of serious injuries, you never hear a complaint or an alibi. His ruptured Achilles' tendon last year is one of the most serious injuries an athlete can experience.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Few basketball fans have a clue as to what it is like for an athlete to compete with other great athletes when injured. Fans incorrectly assume that injured athletes are no big deal. With rare exceptions, they are clueless as to the pain and frustration such athletes experience.</p>
        <p>What I love about Patrick Ewing is that despite a history of serious injuries, you never hear a complaint or an alibi. His ruptured Achilles' tendon last year is one of the most serious injuries an athlete can experience.</p>
        <p>The Achilles' tendon connects the leg muscles with the foot. It is only about one inch wide, and one-eighth of an inch thick. Sewing the two cut ends together can surgically repair this terrible injury. It can be compared to gluing a cracked glass; if the glass is then dropped, that is the end of the glass.</p>
        <p>Ewing had to put 7 feet of height and more than 250 pounds of weight on that patched tendon. What an awesome endeavor for Ewing to retain use of his foot and be able to compete effectively. A year of agonizing rehabilitation, never knowing if he would play again. Imagine, if you will, putting such extraordinary height and weight on a small strip of tissue at the bottom of your body. Successful rehabilitation requires months of daily work while coping with the anxiety and fear about your ability to continue in your career.</p>
        <p>Still, Ewing always maintains his dignity.</p>

        <p>The author, who was the chief of surgery at the Hospital for Joint Diseases and Medical Center from 1959 to 1969, is professor of surgery emeritus at Mount Sinai School of Medicine.</p>
