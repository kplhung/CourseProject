        <p>I HOPPED on the bus with the sign that said ''End of the World Transport,'' and soon was speeding down the road toward the Coast of Death. In the Galician language, both the name of the bus company (Transportes Finisterre) and my destination (Costa da Morte) sounded far less apocalyptic. Still, the translations reminded me that the country I was about to traverse on foot, the rocky, sea-swept corner of northwestern Spain called Galicia, was considered by medieval Europeans to be the limits of the known universe, home to powerful unseen spirits.</p>
        <p>Ancient pagans walked the Costa da Morte as part of a ritual that was eventually suppressed and subsumed into the well-known Christian pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. The route got changed -- now that pilgrimage ends inland, at the cathedral in Santiago, 25 miles short of the sea. The old pagan coastal pathways of Galicia are now little traveled except by local farmers and fisherfolk.</p>
        <p>The idea of walking along paths, back roads and beaches from fishing village to fishing village along the dramatic Galician coast planted itself in my imagination as I mapped out a three-week trip to Spain in May. I dusted off my 20-year-old Swiss hiking boots and bought a new backpack and a copy of an excellent Lonely Planet guide called ''Walking in Spain,'' which outlined a two-day, 25-mile route along the Costa da Morte.</p>
        <p>The Costa da Morte seemed perfect for a walker like me. I prefer staying under a proper roof with hot running water to camping out. This walk passed through several fishing villages where, according to the guide, I would be able to find a bed in a small pension. The path never strayed far from civilization, which made me feel O.K. about setting off on my own. What's more, I would be able to stop in a bar or restaurant when I got hungry, rather than carrying a cooking stove and food. The hike included long stretches of beach walking, some easy rock climbing and cobblestoned country paths, as well as paved roads.</p>
        <p>I made no reservations. The German word for hiker is Wanderer, and that is the spirit in which I set out on the morning I took the express train from Madrid to Santiago de Compostela.</p>
        <p>''In Galicia we speak Gallego'' read the folders on display in the tourist office of Santiago de Compostela. Public signs boasted far more letter X's than you'd ever find in Spanish. Galicia, like Euzkadi (Basque country), is an autonomous region within the larger Spanish state. The Galicians are of Celtic origin, with legends and customs similar to their northern Celtic cousins. (That explains the prevalence of spirits.) Strolling into the Cathedral's grand plaza, I was welcomed by a familiar wailing sound: a lone musician playing Galician bagpipes.</p>
        <p>From Santiago the next morning I took a public bus ($6) and then a taxi ($10) to the starting point. Two hours later, I hauled my backpack into the cafe-bar of the Hostal Residencia Bahia in the coastal fishing village of Laxe. Lunch was over; a few grizzled fishermen were drinking and smoking. Manuel Sacedon Suarez, the proprietor, ran over to help me with my gear. We spoke in Spanish (the second language of most Galicians, though a bit more English is spoken than elsewhere in rural Spain because many people have traveled to Britain to work).</p>
        <p>''Ah! You're hiking . . . you have that English book?''</p>
        <p>I told him yes. He got excited.</p>
        <p>''We get a few of the book people here,'' he said. ''Not too many. But I've made a new map to help the walkers -- the one in the book isn't exactly right. It has the name of a good family who have a place to stay in Camelle, the first stop. But first let's get you a room.''</p>
        <p>Manuel explained that the hostal was completely filled up with the members of a TV crew who were in Laxe shooting a popular Galician soap opera that takes place there.  My heart sank for a moment, both at the news that there was no room, and the intrusion of media mania on my village idyll.</p>
        <p>But Manuel's family owned an old stone house a block or so away that also had rooms. We pulled up to the lovely old three-story building and he took me upstairs. Inside, the traditional structure had been completely renovated. The large room he showed me had a double bed, a bathroom with tub and shower and a little balcony overlooking the red tile rooftops of the village. It even had a little Italian space heater. (Galician nights can be chilly.)</p>
        <p>I was very happy to take it, and amazed by the price he asked, about $16.50. As it turned out, this would be the average cost of a night's stay on my trip, putting Galicia in the same category, pricewise, as India.</p>
        <p>Manuel promised to pick me up the next morning and drive me to the starting point of the walk, which he explained was on a hill high above the village. He left me with his hand-drawn map and a book of tourist information on Laxe.</p>
        <p>The village was more modernized than I'd expected, with just as many new dwellings as old stone houses. Still, the streets were narrow and populated by little groups of short, square elderly women in black dresses, chattering in Gallego. Galicia is a region of elders; because of poverty, waves of Galicians have migrated in the last hundred years, to Cuba, the United States (most of the older Spanish restaurants in New York City are Galician) and England. Older men, dapper in cable sweaters and wool berets, hung out along the seafront wall.</p>
        <p>Manuel left me off the next morning at the Chapel of Santa Cruz da Rosa, 500 feet above the village. There was a muddy path, bordered by a stone wall, that led up over a grassy hill. I followed it for a while, getting used to the weight of my pack in motion -- it was, I realized ruefully, too heavy. Abruptly, the path seemed to branch off in several directions at once.</p>
        <p>Just as I was puzzling over what to do, a woman with a hoe and a bucket happened along. ''You're going to Camelle?'' she asked. ''I'm on my way to my garden to dig up my potatoes. Come with me and I'll show you the right way.''</p>
        <p>We trudged through the muck of the previous night's rain until we reached the crest of the hill, and, suddenly, a broad, beautiful crescent of beach came into view below. ''That's the first beach, then you pass another and then a big one. You can't get lost -- just remember to keep the sea always on your right! Go with God.''</p>
        <p>Moving through impossibly beautiful landscapes of jagged rocks, brilliant green vegetable gardens and sandy strands with all of one's worldly possessions on one's back was an immeasurable thrill, but I would have given anything to have been able to chuck those worldly possessions into the Atlantic. My gear weighed 40 pounds because I had packed for a long trip in several climate zones.</p>
        <p>I gritted my teeth and dug in for the last long stretch of beachwalking, a three-mile haul in hiking boots over sand that sank with every step. At the other end -- over another hill and a labyrinth of private gardens with boundaries marked off by low stone walls -- was the village of Camelle. Exhausted, sweaty, my boots covered with mud, I trundled into the Bar Chalana, where Manuel had told me to inquire about a room. The woman behind the bar pointed me to an old house across the street. ''Just knock on the door,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The house was large but unmarked. (Usually in Spain, a lodging house has a little blue placard with an ''H'' for ''hostal.'') I knocked, and a compact elderly woman in a plaid apron opened the door. She grabbed my hand and beamed excitedly.</p>
        <p>''Come! Come! Sit down! Eat!''</p>
        <p>She ran off into the kitchen before I even had a chance to get my pack off. I shouted to her that I probably ought to take a shower first, and did she have a room for the night?</p>
        <p>''Oh, shower . . . yes, yes, yes. And a room. Come upstairs, you take a shower and I'll have the food ready when you come down.''</p>
        <p>Dona Maria, in her 70's, was a bit absent-minded -- she left the pots on too long in the kitchen and I could hear them bubbling over as we talked, over dinner. But she was a sweetheart, and her rooms -- there were three in all, with a shared bathroom -- were clean and comfy. After I ate, she steered me toward Camelle's main attraction: an eccentric German named Man who lives at the edge of the sea in a shack surrounded by a display of his own phallic sculpture.</p>
        <p>On the way to Man's lair, I met several fishermen who instructed me on the drill. ''Don't be afraid. He won't be wearing any clothes. Knock on his door and give him 100 pesetas. Then you can look at his sculpture garden.''</p>
        <p>I knocked. A spectrally thin man in his 60's with stringy, shoulder-length hair and wearing a burlap loincloth answered the door. I handed him the coin and he handed me a notebook, saying, in heavily German-accented Spanish, ''Draw me. And watch out for those fishermen. No good!''</p>
        <p>Dona Maria made it hard to leave the next morning. Every time I started to say goodbye, additional plates of food appeared on the breakfast table -- first homemade brown Galician bread and cheese, then fried fish and an omelet. She insisted on making me lunch, a sandwich of strong, spicy homemade chorizo. I put it in my pack, in a sealed plastic bag. Three days later, my socks still smelled like chorizo.</p>
        <p>Day 2 on the Lonely Planet program was supposed to take seven and a half hours, including two significant side trips and two ''strenuous'' climbs. I passed through the villages of Arou and Santa Marina and paused briefly at the English Cemetery, a monument to a spectacular shipwreck, one of many that occurred along this stretch of coast.  At 7 p.m., the next landmark, the Cabo Vilan lighthouse, was but a speck in the distance, and I was three hard miles, by the book's route, away from my goal, the village of Camarinas. A shepherd told me the asphalt road would take me there in 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>It was the biggest village along my walk, so why was every hostal in town closed? (Answer: May is low season on the Galician coast, and many hostals open only for July and August vacationers.) An elderly fishermen approached me and pointed me in the direction of the Hostal Gaviota. Not only was Dolores Mendez Romar's hostal spotless, more like a hotel than a guesthouse (my sunny room, with double bed, TV, and private bath cost $14) but it also adjoined the best restaurant in town. The Gaviota specializes in Galician-style seafood, supplied from the boat Mrs. Mendez Romar owns with her sister-in-law Irene.</p>
        <p>While devouring a remarkably tender plate of fresh Galician octopus (pulpo) in olive oil, I chatted with Dolores, describing my adventures.</p>
        <p>She looked impressed. ''Where will you go next?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>I laughed and rubbed my sore shoulders. ''Anyplace the bus goes to from here.''</p>
        <p>She looked worried. ''Haven't you heard? There is no bus. Not until the weekend.'' She pulled out a newspaper -- I hadn't seen one in days -- and the headline read: ''Transportes Finisterre on Strike -- Galicia Paralyzed!'' The local company had been taken over by a multinational corporation, and the drivers had staged a temporary strike to protect their jobs. I imagined the fingers of globalization, stretching all the way to the End of the World to hold me, immobile, in Camarinas. Then I imagined walking back up to the lonely, windswept Cabo Vilan lighthouse, along rocky cliffs, through fields of purple and yellow wildflowers -- with the 40-pound pack safely stashed back in my room at the Gaviota.</p>
        <p>Yes, said Dona Dolores with a smile, she could rent me the room for as long as I wanted to stay.</p>
        <p>The bottom line along the Costa da Morte</p>
        <p>I spent $34 a day on meals and lodging during my six-day journey through Galicia, including two nights in Santiago de Compostela. In the Galician villages one can get by comfortably on $25 a day, making the region one of Europe's most remarkable bargains. (Prices have been calculated at 183 pesetas to the dollar.)</p>
        <p>Air Fare</p>
        <p>My round-trip ticket from Kennedy Airport to Madrid included a side trip from Madrid to Tenerife, Canary Islands. The total fare, on Iberia, was $575.</p>
        <p>Accommodations</p>
        <p>Spain has one of the best-organized systems of budget lodgings I've encountered. I stayed mainly in a type of accommodation called a hostal, not to be confused with a youth hostel; it is more like a pension or guesthouse.</p>
        <p>The regional tourism authority inspects hostals and rates them from one to three stars, with a three-star hostal often surpassing the comfort and amenities of a one- or two-star hotel. Hostals display a rectangular blue placard near the front door showing the star rating.</p>
        <p>In Santiago de Compostela, I stayed in a small, cheerful two-star hotel, the Hotel Real, Caldereria 49, (34-981) 569 290, fax (34-981) 569 291. The recently opened hotel, in the medieval walled city, isn't in most guidebooks yet, which is why I was able to snag my room at the last minute. (The nicer places in central Santiago are reserved well in advance.) My small but pretty single had a brass double bed, balcony overlooking the street and bathroom with shower; it cost $44 a night  including Continental breakfast.</p>
        <p>Manuel Sacedon Suarez, the proprietor of the Hostal Bahia in Laxe, Avenida Generalisimo 24, (34-981) 728 207, introduced me to Galician hospitality from the moment I stepped into his family's cafe. Although his hostal was full, he found me a wonderful room in an old stone house that belonged to his grandmother, for $16.50 a night. His parents speak excellent English.</p>
        <p>In the village of Camelle, at the Bar Chalana on the main street, I asked about a room and was directed across the street to a big white house owned by Dona Maria, the mother of the bar's owner. She rents three bedrooms with a shared bath on the third floor to guests for $11 a night. She fed me dinner (fried fish, potatoes, salad) and breakfast and packed me a lunch -- all for $5.50.</p>
        <p>In Camarinas, at the pleasant, immaculate Hostal Gaviota, Calle del Rio 13, (34-981) 736 522, my room with private bath cost $15 a night ($22 in summer).</p>
        <p>Places to Eat</p>
        <p>In Santiago de Compostela, O Beiro, Rua Raina, 3, (34-981) 581 370, is a serious wine bar with a wonderful selection of Spanish vintages. The menu of Galician artisanal cheeses includes the breast-shaped Queso de Tetilla; hams, sausages and homemade pates also complement the wine list. A light dinner with a glass of fine Ribera del Duero red wine cost around $12.</p>
        <p>Nearby, the tapas bar O 42, Rua de Franco 42, (34-981) 581 009, is a convivial place that served delicious Galician octopus, which goes well with the local white Albarino. A glass of wine and two tapas is about $10.</p>
        <p>In Laxe, most restaurants open only for the summer. But I had a pleasant seafood dinner -- fish, potatoes, wine -- at Restaurante Sar  diniera, Rosalia de Castro, 51, for $7.50.</p>
        <p>The Hostal and Restaurante Gaviota in Camarinas (address above) prepare their very fresh seafood simply, with olive oil and herbs or red peppers. Dinner, with wine, comes to around $12.</p>
        <p>Local Transportation</p>
        <p>My round trip express train fare from Madrid to Santiago de Compostela cost around $91.</p>
        <p>It's a bit tricky to get to Laxe from Santiago, since there's no direct bus service. I took a Transportes Finisterre bus from Santiago to the village of Baio ($5.50) then hired a cab to take me the rest of the way ($8). Returning from Camarinas, I would have taken the Transportes Finisterre bus to Santiago ($8) had there not been a strike afoot. Instead, I hired a car to take me back in time to catch my train -- expensive ($44), but I had a tight agenda.</p>
        <p>Guidebooks</p>
        <p>The walk I took, from Laxe to Camarinas, is described and mapped in the Lonely Planet guide ''Walking in Spain.'' I found the route instructions to be reasonably accurate, but I also had to use my own sense of orientation and ask for directions.</p>
        <p>For those who can decipher some Spanish, it's worth digging up a copy of the ''Guia Viva: Galicia,'' published in Madrid, which has excellent tips on lodging and restaurants.</p>
