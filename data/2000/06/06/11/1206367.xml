        <p>GOING to a gym when your figure is not quite svelte isn't easy. For those who are obese, elderly, sedentary or have chronic health conditions like asthma, walking the treadmill at a snail's pace or struggling to lift a five-pound weight can seem downright humiliating. And without monitoring, it may not even be safe.</p>

        <p>GOING to a gym when your figure is not quite svelte isn't easy. For those who are obese, elderly, sedentary or have chronic health conditions like asthma, walking the treadmill at a snail's pace or struggling to lift a five-pound weight can seem downright humiliating. And without monitoring, it may not even be safe.</p>
        <p>But there was 63-year-old Sybil Upbin, working out her biceps on the preacher curl recently at the Oxygym in New Hyde Park, then switching to the overhead press to strengthen her shoulders.</p>
        <p>Ms. Upbin has asthma. Working in a pediatric office for 19 years, she rarely stretched any part of her body other than her brain. She used the treadmill in her home, but only as a clothes hanger. When she made her bed, she needed to sit down and rest for 20 minutes. Simply climbing the stairs in her Jericho split level left her breathless.</p>
        <p>''I'm not anymore,'' said Ms. Upbin, after working out three times a week, an hour a day, for over a month at what is believed to be the first gym on Long Island geared exclusively toward the elderly, the obese and those with chronic diseases. ''It's quite an improvement. I did no exercise at all. This is helping my being out of breath all the time.''</p>
        <p>Because she needed to be monitored, Ms. Upbin never considered going to a regular gym. At Oxygym, her blood pressure is taken and blood oxygen levels monitored before, during and after each workout.</p>
        <p>Besides, she added, ''I don't want to stay next to somebody in a little tight, stretchy warm-up suit.''</p>
        <p>Richard Markx, 46, Oxygym's founder and president, and a registered respiratory therapist, said the fitness center catered to those in their 70's, 80's and 90's who want to retain their independence. It opened in January.</p>
        <p>''This is all about improving and maintaining functionality so that people can drive their cars and feel safe enough to go out and go to the shopping center and have enough energy to go to the mall or to play with their grandkids or continue playing golf,'' Mr. Markx said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Markx, of Lattingtown, lectures and deals with patients at the  pulmonary rehabilitation centers at several different hospitals. When he started a home-care company about 19 years ago, he was determined to give one-on-one attention to his clients.</p>
        <p>''I was trying to get them in better shape, trying to do respiratory therapy rather than being an equipment dealer,'' he said. ''I soon found out after a year that's impossible to do by yourself going from home to home.''</p>
        <p>A year and a half ago, while looking at new offices for his home-care company, Home Respiratory Therapy and Equipment, he noticed an extra 3,500-square-feet space available upstairs. He began toying with the idea of a specialized workout center.</p>
        <p>''Most of the people I was seeing were not able to go to a real gym,'' he said, though they used hospital-based facilities until their insurance coverage ran out.</p>
        <p>''Not everyone wants to come to a hospital setting to exercise. And there is no place to follow up. They were very clinical and not a lot of fun.'' His vision was of a gym that would also be warm, secure and upbeat, an adult fitness hangout.</p>
        <p>The initial 36 monitored sessions, including a one-on-one assessment, is $500. A doctor's prescription is necessary for the cardio-exercise test, performed to make sure members are capable of doing the 12-week workouts. Information is available at (516) 437-7236.</p>
        <p>''This is for seniors, but it's for seniors with special needs as well,'' Mr. Markx said. ''It's for seniors to whom the doctor says, you've got a problem, now go exercise. That's not so easy to do.''</p>
        <p>After warming up, members work the resistance and cardiac circuits as a group, moving from machine to machine at the prompting of a compact disc. ''Most people hate exercising, so the getting out and having social relations is nearly as important as the improvement they are making physically,'' Mr. Markx said.</p>
        <p>Though her arms were toothpick thin and frail-looking, Lorraine Leary, 75, of Hicksville stood against the wall, an oxygen tank at her side, tubes pumping air into her nose as she lifted three-pound weights. Supplemental oxygen is provided free of charge.</p>
        <p>''I have emphysema; I'm seeing how much exercising helps,'' said Ms. Leary, a mother of 6, grandmother of 11 and recent great-grandmother who has been coming to the health club three times a week for more than two months. She had already walked on the treadmill, pedaled a recumbent bike and worked out for five minutes apiece on a rowing machine and step machine. She did 11 repetitions using 20-pound weights on the strength-training circuit, five minutes on each.</p>
        <p>''I don't think my lungs are much better because they are pretty bad,'' Ms. Leary said. ''But my attitude is, and I'm moving around more. It's something I look forward to. It gets you up. You feel more invigorated. When this music comes on, I wait and try to get the beat with the machine. I feel better the rest of the day.''</p>
        <p>Back to Future</p>
        <p>It was a moment in time they never forgot. And it may have been the longest lesson in school history.</p>
        <p>Thirty-three years ago, as part of a science unit on time, they covered the clocks at Meadow Elementary School in Baldwin. Then they buried a time capsule stuffed with memorabilia of the 1960's -- Creepy Crawlers, a bobby pin, Vicks cough drops, a flashlight, a flag, a troll, a dime, newspapers, essays and their own photographs -- on the front lawn of the school. It was to be opened in 2000.</p>
        <p>''I was a second grader at the time,'' recalled 39-year-old Jackie Zuckerman. ''It started out as a lesson in time. The end of the lesson is taking place today. I think people very rarely get a chance to glimpse their childhood.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Zuckerman, the historian for the Parent-Teacher Association, said calls about digging up the capsule starting pouring into the school office as the millenium approached. ''This is their chance,'' she said. ''There was so much excitement that day. This was talked about year after year.''.</p>
        <p>More than 400 alumni returned to the school recently for the unearthing. First, they glanced at name tags.  They laughed. They reminisced. They listened to their former principal, John O'Connor, now 76. Without missing a beat, they sang the Meadow School song. Then they pulled the old time capsule out of the ground and insisted that going back to the future was better than a high school reunion.</p>
        <p>''This is the best gift anybody could give me,'' said Jeff Seiver, 40, a dentist from Syosset, who returned to the school a day earlier for a head start looking over the photographs of his old third-grade classmates that hang in the hallway. ''This is a high for me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Seiver couldn't remember what had been put into the capsule. He didn't really care. That was just the bait, he said. Though his two best friends are still from elementary school, it was the first time he had seen most of his classmates in over three decades.</p>
        <p>Freddie Pasch Goldberg, 43, flew in from California. She was a member of the first class to go from kindergarten through sixth grade at the South Shore school, which opened in 1962. And there was no way she was going to miss seeing the capsule dug up again.</p>
        <p>''You didn't understand the concept of the year 2000 in those days,'' Ms. Pasch Goldberg said ''I haven't been back in Baldwin for 13 years, since I moved to L.A. This is what it took to get me out of L.A. and into Baldwin.''</p>
        <p>Marc Roth, of East Hills, who was in the sixth grade when the time capsule was buried, said: ''I look at people and they look so changed; I didn't change. I was standing over there saying, what will life be like when I'm 44?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth wasn't surprised that more alumni showed up for the time capsule than came to their high school reunion a few years ago. ''This meant more than high school,'' he said. ''We were thinking about where we were going then. When we were here, this was life. This was our life, and it was a good life. It was just Baldwin, the epitome of America.''</p>
        <p>Later, history repeated itself. The 835 students who now attend the Meadow School buried their own time capsule, including a floppy disk, a blank compact disc, Beanie Babies, a Furbee and a Harry Potter book.</p>
        <p>''I definitely am going to come back,'' said Alyssa Zuckerman, 11, referring to the day 25 years hence when that capsule is to be unearthed. ''We are going to be looking upon our children the way they are now, in our minds and in our hearts. It's the same lessons our parents had. I'm going to be thinking about it for the next 25 years.''</p>
