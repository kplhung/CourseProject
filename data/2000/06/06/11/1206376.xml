        <p>DONNA MARIE GEFFEN never told her husband to turn down the television or yelled at her children for making too much noise. Neither has she played her favorite song over and over again, or paused to listen to the birds outside her window.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Geffen has lived in a world of complete silence since she was born profoundly deaf in 1963. At first, the doctors told Donna's mother that her deafness resulted when the umbilical cord coiled tightly around her neck during delivery. But when her brother John was born deaf seven years later, a genetic cause was theorized, though there was no history of deafness on either side of Donna's family.</p>
        <p>Donna started speech therapy at 2 and at 3 began learning to read lips and speak. She wore hearing aids, but said in one of a series of e-mail interviews, ''I could never hear anything with the aids at all.''</p>
        <p>When she was 12, Donna transferred to the Mill Neck Manor School for the Deaf in Oyster Bay, where she met 13-year-old Bruce K. Geffen.</p>
        <p>''He was my first boyfriend,'' she said of her husband of 14 years, now a postal worker in Garden City. The couple have two children: Matthew, who is 11 and has perfect hearing, and Amanda, who was born deaf and now attends Mill Neck school.</p>
        <p>Last month Mr. and Mrs. Geffen and Amanda underwent cochlear-implant surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan in the hope, Mrs. Geffen said, ''of us being able to hear birds chirping, water running, people breathing, crickets and everything.'' The implants, which take two to three hours to place, permit sound waves to bypass the damaged parts of the ear.</p>
        <p>Dr. Simon C. Parisier, chairman emeritus of the department of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery at Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital and Lenox Hill Hospital, said: ''It is unusual to perform three implants in a totally deaf family. In this instance, a dominant gene must be present that accounts for the pervasive familial deafness.'' Mr. Geffen carries the dominant gene for deafness; Mrs. Geffen has a recessive one.</p>
        <p>The risks may involve a temporary weakness of facial nerves, which occurs perhaps once in 300 cases, or temporary vertigo, which Mr. Geffen suffered from. The implant device, which has an estimated lifespan of more than 70 years, has a failure rate of less than 1 percent in children and even lower in adults, Dr. Parisier added. The surgery costs between $30,000 and $50,000 and is usually covered by medical insurance, Medicare, the Veterans Administration and, in some states, Medicaid.</p>
        <p>Dr. Parisier, who is also the medical director of the Children's Hearing Institute at Lenox Hill, said, ''Children who are implanted young and during the language-learning years have the potential of developing good speaking and listening skills, and for adults with long-term deafness, the ability to discriminate a wide variety of environmental sounds is enhanced.''</p>
        <p>With normal hearing, sound moves from the outer ear into the ear canal and then the eardrum, which is attached to three small bones that carry the vibration to the cochlea, a fluid-filled structure in the inner ear. Hair fibers in the cochlea then send electrical impulses to the nerves that convey impulses to the brain, resulting in the perception of sound.</p>
        <p>The surgery involves implanting a small electronic device, the receiver,  under the skin behind the ear. It extends into the cochlea, bypassing the damaged hair cells and directly stimulating undamaged nerves in the inner ear. A small headpiece behind the ear contains a microphone that picks up sound and transmits it to a speech processor that converts the sound into electrical impulses.</p>
        <p>The signals then go to the implant, and electrodes send them to the brain, where they are interpreted as sound. The speech processor can be worn either behind the ear or on a belt.</p>
        <p>According to the Deafness Research Foundation, 12,000 babies are born deaf every year in this country. Twenty-four states have enacted laws mandating that newborns be screened for hearing loss in order to begin early treatment. (New York's law went into effect Jan. 1.)</p>
        <p>Deafness can also result from diseases like meningitis or measles, injury, a reaction to some antibiotics or anticancer medications, or aging.</p>
        <p>The cochlear implants were first marketed in 1972 and approved by the Food and Drug Administration for adults in 1985, and for children in 1990. Today, over 32,000 adults and children worldwide have received them.</p>
        <p>While the implants do not provide normal hearing, they help recipients recognize sound and understand what is being said, often with the aid of lip reading.</p>
        <p>In adults who became deaf after they learned language, more than 75 percent are able to hear well enough to speak on the telephone.</p>
        <p>But the surgery is just a part of the complex process of gaining or regaining hearing, said Patricia M. Chute, director of the Cochlear Implant Center at Lenox Hill Hospital.</p>
        <p>''Extensive tests before the surgery evaluate the amount of benefit an individual is getting from hearing aids, the ability to perceive speech and the requisite commitment to post-operative therapy, which emphasizes speaking and listening,'' she explained. ''This does not necessarily mean that children cannot use sign language with the cochlear implants; it just means that they must have ample opportunity to experience language through hearing and speaking and not just through a visual system.''</p>
        <p>''For congenitally deaf adults like the Geffens,'' she added, ''auditory  training therapy will probably last over the course of several months,'' and for Amanda significantly longer.</p>
        <p>The Geffens are excited and optimistic about having their devices turned on this month, but the prospect of listening to a Mozart symphony or even the glub-glub of a clogged drain is not shared by all members of the deaf community.</p>
        <p>''To many people who are deaf and who share a language and aspects of a culture, the 'disability' of deafness is more a characteristic of who they are than of a deficiency that needs remediation,'' said Dr. Mark R. Prowatzke, executive director of Mill Neck Manor. ''The thought that they have something that needs to be 'fixed' is foreign to them, and in some measure insulting.</p>
        <p>''Even the increasingly accepted change of deaf to 'Deaf' is controversial. The Deaf tend to want this designation to support their notions of cultural/linguistic minority status, while others who are deaf view this as insignificant or meaningless.''</p>
        <p>He said that those who object view the implants as ''invasive and tantamount to abuse, because they feel this is a forced changing of some of the characteristics that makes a 'Deaf person' a person.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Prowatzke said that seven students have implants and that ''the results are between good and very good.''</p>
        <p>''The ability to hear and respond to sounds has been greatly enhanced,'' he said, but ''there is limited evidence at this point as to how these new technologies will actually pan out over the long run because there hasn't been a long run as yet.''</p>
        <p>He said the school's philosophy ''is to utilize all the means possible to enhance students' chances to achieve.''</p>
        <p>The debate is moot to Donna Geffen, who received an advanced degree from the National Technology Institute for the Deaf in Rochester and, for nearly 16 years, has worked as a medical technician in the hematology department of Good Samaritan Hospital. She also teaches American Sign Language at Suffolk Community College in Selden, and is a substitute public school teacher in East Meadow, where the Geffens live.</p>
        <p>Saying that her decision for the surgery was ''guided by my faith in God,'' she added: ''Bruce and I have 12 deaf members in our family. We've grown up within both deaf and hearing communities. We are happy and proud of who we are, and we have deaf pride.</p>
        <p>''Now we're rolling the dice! We have a strong desire to be part of the hearing world.''</p>
