        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Bravo to Harold Bloom's ''On First Looking Into Gates's Crichton'' (June 4), on the joys of holding and reading a book printed on paper as opposed to watching type fly by on a computer screen. As a writer about literature for young children, I'd like to add that these first books, and our later ones as well, have important tactile qualities, actual bodies --  skin, bones, textures, even smells. Taken to bed at night for comfort, hidden under pillows, stashed away in attics, they are often brought to college freshman year, and passed on, in time, to grandchildren with all their raggedy edges and scribbles intact.</p>
