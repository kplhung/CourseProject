        <p>Where can young television viewers go after they have turned the corner on Sesame Street and stopped looking for Pokemon badges in Miridian City but still aren't ready to dip their toes into Dawson's Creek?</p>
        <p>Until recently, their destinations were limited. With the exception of some series on Nickelodeon, the children's cable network, few comedies or dramas spoke directly to viewers who were past preschool but not puberty -- the group television executives refer to as ''tweenagers'' or ''tweens.'' Films had become even more scarce. Most made-for-television movies were directed toward an older audience, and even the motion picture industry appeared to have lost interest, at least since Macaulay Culkin started shaving.</p>

        <p>Where can young television viewers go after they have turned the corner on Sesame Street and stopped looking for Pokemon badges in Miridian City but still aren't ready to dip their toes into Dawson's Creek?</p>
        <p>Until recently, their destinations were limited. With the exception of some series on Nickelodeon, the children's cable network, few comedies or dramas spoke directly to viewers who were past preschool but not puberty -- the group television executives refer to as ''tweenagers'' or ''tweens.'' Films had become even more scarce. Most made-for-television movies were directed toward an older audience, and even the motion picture industry appeared to have lost interest, at least since Macaulay Culkin started shaving.</p>
        <p>''We looked around about 18 months ago and said, 'Tweens have really been abandoned,' '' said Rich Ross, general manager of the Disney Channel and its executive vice president for programming and production. ''Tom Cruise opens a movie; a kid doesn't.''</p>
        <p>The new millennium, however, seems to have sparked the rediscovery of that betwixt-and-between period. Witness the huge success of the Fox sitcom ''Malcolm in the Middle,'' whose young hero epitomizes middle school, middle child and middle America. Or the box-office receipts of ''Snow Day,'' a film that revolved around the world of 9- to 14-year-olds. And this summer the Disney Channel is broadcasting an original film every month that touches on these years, which, as any survivor knows, are among life's most angst-ridden.</p>
        <p>''The drama of everyday life for an eighth grader is more drama than a soap opera has in a week,'' Mr. Ross said. ''Everything has that unnatural aura of change. And before that age, you didn't understand why those kids were like that. If you can just get inside the head of an eighth grader.''</p>
        <p>Disney's new television films have been getting inside their heads since last winter. The first of the network's summer offerings, ''Stepsister From Planet Weird,'' will be shown on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. and rebroadcast seven times before the end of the month. ''Stepsister,'' based on a novel by Frances Lantz, is intended to resonate with every child of divorce who is convinced that his or her new stepfamily is a bunch of space aliens. Except, in this case, they really are.</p>
        <p>''We were really looking at a movie about blended families,'' Mr. Ross said. ''This is an extreme version.''</p>
        <p>And how! Courtnee Draper plays Megan Larson, 14, who lives with her somewhat flaky divorced mother (Khrystyne Haje) and her pesky little brother, Trevor (Myles Jeffrey). Megan is horrified when her mother brings home her new love, Cosmo Cola (Lance Guest), and his daughter, Ariel (Tamara Hope). Ariel's sense of humor is about as highly developed as that of Mr. Spock in ''Star Trek.'' She also has a strange fear of wind and a tendency to lock herself in the bathroom at odd times. (She doesn't have bulimia; she's turning herself into a vapor cloud.)</p>
        <p>The plot reaches out to middle schoolers with as many tentacles as a creature from ''Star Wars.'' Ariel and her dad come from a planet where all beings are gaseous, so expect special effects. Their origins also create the opportunity for a low-tech showdown between good aliens and bad aliens, in which the weapons are hair dryers and leaf blowers rather than ray guns. The fact that the despised Ariel becomes the most popular student at Megan's school will seem more than plausible to clique-rejected Earth girls. And when the young enemies join together to stop their parents' impending marriage -- what television viewer in this age range doesn't enjoy seeing adults humiliated?</p>
        <p>''I think what it comes down to is that if you hit them on all cylinders, you build an understanding with your audience,'' Mr. Ross said.</p>
        <p>''Ready to Run,'' Disney's July film, concerns members of two different species with growing pains: a young girl and a horse. Corrie Ortiz, played by Krissy Perez, longs to be a jockey, even though her father died in a racing accident and her mother (Theresa Saldana) is opposed to the plan. The horse, who, in a quintessential Disney touch, can talk (only Corrie can hear him), has his own identity crisis.</p>
        <p>''We wanted a Latina protagonist, because the offerings there are beyond scarce,'' Mr. Ross said, noting that the Latin population is also the fastest-growing in the country. But although this film appeals to that audience, the girl's ambition, the thrill of racing and the parent-child conflict will draw in more viewers, he hopes, and not just other ''tweens.''</p>
        <p>''If a 5-year-old likes a talking horse or finds a horse cool, there's nothing wrong with that,'' Mr. Ross said. He notices very little ''co-sibling viewing'' in the television audience, and part of Disney's aim, he acknowledged, is to bring it back.</p>
        <p>But if a film is intended for family viewing, it may be unable to touch on other subjects that concern 9- to 14-year-olds, like sexuality, school violence and experimentation with cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. Mr. Ross did not rule out delving into those areas in the future, and noted that a new fall Disney series, ''In a Heartbeat,'' about teen-age paramedics, will explore some of that terrain. ''We thought it was a way to do 'E.R.' for our audience,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So far, though, the only hospital scenes this summer are in Disney's August film, ''Quints.'' Its middle school heroine, Jamie Grover, a former only child, finds herself on the fringes of family life after her mother gives birth to quintuplets.</p>
        <p>The challenge was finding an emotional center for the story, said Gregory Pincus, one of the screenwriters. ''I decided, you think your life would be better if your parents paid less attention to you,'' he said. ''Then, all of a sudden, no one pays attention to you, and that's not a good thing. It became the story of a girl finding herself.'' Jamie, played by Kimberly J. Brown, discovers a talent in art, an area in which her parents never pressured her to succeed.</p>
        <p>It is purely coincidental, Mr. Ross said, that these particular films have female leads. The network's May film, in fact, starred Frankie Muniz of ''Malcolm in the Middle,'' whom Disney auditioned, he added proudly, before he became a household name.</p>
        <p>''These were just the three best movies for summer,'' he said, an appropriate time for ''more fantastical, broader themes.''</p>
        <p>It will surprise no one that all three also have upbeat conclusions. But the Disney team prefers to see the endings as resolutions rather than ''happily ever afters.''</p>
        <p>''This is also about entertainment,'' Mr. Pincus said. ''You want kids to watch the film and have a good time. If you have these problems in your life, you want to seek a solution yourself, like the characters in the movie.''</p>
