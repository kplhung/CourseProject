        <p>AS a rock star and actress, Courtney Love knows how to grab the spotlight. At a new-media conference last month in Manhattan's SoHo, she delivered her keynote address in 70's-style hip huggers and angrily shouted at paparazzi who were blinding her with their camera flashes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Love's message was similarly striking. ''Stealing an artist's music without paying for it is absolute piracy,'' she said. ''And I'm talking about major-label recording contracts, not Napster.''</p>

        <p>AS a rock star and actress, Courtney Love knows how to grab the spotlight. At a new-media conference last month in Manhattan's SoHo, she delivered her keynote address in 70's-style hip huggers and angrily shouted at paparazzi who were blinding her with their camera flashes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Love's message was similarly striking. ''Stealing an artist's music without paying for it is absolute piracy,'' she said. ''And I'm talking about major-label recording contracts, not Napster.''</p>
        <p>In siding with Napster, the free Internet music-swapping service that has become the record labels' archenemy, Ms. Love demonstrated that the continuing power struggle between the labels and the musicians is taking a new turn.</p>
        <p>''I'm leaving the major-label system, and there are hundreds of artists watching my court case and wanting to follow me,'' Ms. Love declared. She and her band, Hole, are in a legal fight to end their recording deal with Geffen Records, which is owned by the Universal Music Group, itself part of the Seagram Company.</p>
        <p>Ms. Love is among the musicians raising the revolutionary notion that the Internet may offer them a better shake than the labels, which they accuse of imposing burdensome contracts.</p>
        <p>Though some prominent acts like Metallica and Dr. Dre side with the labels against the free download sites, a loose pro-Napster coalition is forming that includes rock bands like the Offspring and Limp Bizkit (which is touring with Napster sponsorship this summer), as well as rappers like Chuck D and the Beastie Boys.</p>
        <p>Last week, however, brought evidence that the labels and the independent music sites were finding ways to coexist. On Wednesday, shares of MP3.com, an online music site that the recording industry has sued, contending copyright infringement, surged 45 percent, to $16.875, amid reports  of a settlement, which was announced the next day, with some major labels.</p>
        <p>At a Congressional hearing last month, Sheryl Crow, the singer and songwriter, criticized the labels' insistence on owning the copyrights to most songs. Aimee Mann and Jonatha Brooke have found new careers marketing directly to fans via the Web, offering free downloads, CD sales and concert schedules. Some small labels are offering free music downloads as well as selling discs.</p>
        <p>Could free music downloads, whose rapid  growth challenges copyright laws, give musicians the upper hand in dealing with the record companies? The major labels, which will start selling digital music downloads this summer, may not like the answer.</p>
        <p>Label executives say they offer musicians invaluable marketing and promotion, adding that they can perform these services much better than musicians or their managers can on their own. ''It makes better business sense to pool together resources, which is what a record label does,'' said Paul Vidich, an executive vice president at Warner Music, a unit of Time Warner.</p>
        <p>Only a musician like Ms. Love, with proven marquee value, might survive without a label deal, executives say -- but probably not for long. ''They don't have the clout as one artist to get the kind of broad-reaching breakthrough on the Internet on a worldwide basis,'' said Kevin Conroy, head of new technology at BMG Entertainment, whose  stars include Whitney Houston and Santana.</p>
        <p>Danny Goldberg, a former head of Mercury and Warner Music and now president of the independent Artemis Records, said the labels could afford far more marketing than the musicians. ''An artist without marketing is at a disadvantage in a very cluttered world,'' he said. ''Marketing costs money.''</p>
        <p>But some musicians, who complain about being charged high recording and manufacturing costs before they even see a royalty check, say they can market themselves with free online music. ''Being a gatekeeper is the most profitable place to be,'' Ms. Love said in her address. ''But now we're in a world without gates.''</p>
        <p>Some analysts even say that rapid technological advances could render copyright laws unenforceable, making battles against free music futile and forcing a decline of the record business. Musicians would instead make a living from their live performances and sales of products like T-shirts.</p>
        <p>LABEL executives say free online music will not be a threat. They point to the  agreement with MP3.com and to recent courtroom victories in cases that would restrict Napster's traffic in free music. ''I believe that if we offer consumers an effective online alternative that is reasonably priced, we have every opportunity to build a legitimate market,'' Mr. Conroy said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldberg was even blunter, saying, ''I think it's equally as likely that land would be free than copyrights would be free.''</p>
        <p>But a report in April by Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, a research firm in New York, predicted that 16 percent, or $985 million, of the nation's music sales in 2002 would be lost to what it termed Web piracy.</p>
        <p>Efforts to squelch free music have had uncertain results. In recent weeks, the rock band Metallica and the rapper Dr. Dre pressured Napster to ban from its site hundreds of thousands of fans who had downloaded their music free. Many, however, simply re-registered with different names.</p>
        <p>Record labels say they represent their artists' best interests. But to get recorded, new musicians often sign contracts favorable to the labels, then hire prominent entertainment lawyers to get them out of these contracts once they make it big.</p>
        <p>Even some stars say their agreements leave most of the profits, beyond a relatively small advance, to the labels. The contracts criticized by Ms. Love and other musicians can leave them with only pennies per disk from royalties, after subtracting advances and production costs.</p>
        <p>''Selling records is not necessarily consistent with the interest of the artists,'' said Ken Hertz, a partner in the law firm Hansen, Jacobson, Teller &amp; Hoberman, which represents big-name acts like Alanis Morissette and No Doubt.</p>
        <p>Since contracts for younger, newer musicians tend to be the least favorable -- when they can get a contract at all -- those artists have the greatest incentives to use free music to their advantage. Hundreds of unsigned acts have uploaded free music files to Web sites like MP3.com in hopes of getting exposure.</p>
        <p>A few smaller recording labels are already using free music to promote for young musicians. Scott Ross, director of new media at Moonshine Records of West Hollywood, Calif., an independent dance-music label whose most popular artists sell 100,000 albums, said giving away MP3 files over the Web had helped to double the sales growth rate of his company in the last year and saved on marketing costs.</p>
        <p>''We don't get mainstream radio play; we don't get on MTV,'' Mr. Ross said. ''So the Internet is our best source of exposure.''</p>
        <p>Stephen James Barry, a member of one of Moonshine's best-selling acts, Cirrus, said that offering free music on the Internet -- where many of its young fans gather -- had helped to generate bigger audiences for his group's concerts. Although all its music was available free on the Internet, Mr. Barry said, its CD sales were not hurt, because Cirrus's true fans wanted to collect everything the band produced.</p>
        <p>He can even see his band deciding to handle its marketing and sales directly. ''Right now, you don't really need a record label,'' he said. ''When it becomes cheaper and easier to get your music and promotion out to the people, then you stop needing the label.''</p>
