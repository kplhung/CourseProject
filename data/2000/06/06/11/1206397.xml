        <p>The French think Champagne on Bastille Day. Americans don't on the Fourth of July. But proper celebration of Independence Day requires more than Bud Light or its sparkling-wine equivalent, Korbel.</p>
        <p>In 1984, Gilbert Gruet &amp; Fils, a small Champagne house in France, planted its tricolor in, yes, Albuquerque and ever since has been making one of America's best -- and best-priced -- sparkling wines from New Mexican grapes.</p>
        <p>The label, Gruet, first came to New York City's attention when the restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten introduced it at Jo-Jo in 1991. On and off, he has stocked it at his four-star Jean Georges.</p>
        <p>Though federal regulations and deference to the appellation and uniqueness of Champagne require most American producers to call their wares sparkling wine, Gruet is Champagne in spirit and content. It rises to June-wedding levels.</p>
        <p>Gruet nonvintage chardonnay-based brut -- dry, spare, lightly fruity, delicately yeasty, bright with racy applelike mouth-watering acidity and tiny bubbles -- is an aperitif and dinner-long wine, especially with surf courses.</p>
        <p>This brut costs $12 at Suburban Wine, 379 Downing Drive, Yorktown Heights; $13 at Dodd's, Millwood Shopping Center, Routes 100 and 133; and $14 at Armonk Wines, 383 Main Street, Armonk.</p>
        <p>Gruet makes a fine brut nonvintage blanc de noirs that does not seem to be sold in Westchester County, but merchants can order it. This fuller, rounder but still lean wine, is pretty, with a pinkish hue in its color, which expresses pinot noir. Drink it lightly cool, and you'll relish the tea roses and young watermelon in the bouquet.</p>
