        <p>There was no Triple Crown hanging in the balance. There was no showdown between the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winners. But a large, high-spirited crowd of 67,810 braved a muggy day for the 132nd running of the Belmont Stakes yesterday, as well as a rich, competitive undercard of stakes races.</p>
        <p>That number was far below the record of 85,818 set last year when Charismatic was trying to sweep the Triple Crown, but was close to the 70,682 that attended the 1997 Belmont when Silver Charm was going for the sweep.</p>

        <p>There was no Triple Crown hanging in the balance. There was no showdown between the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winners. But a large, high-spirited crowd of 67,810 braved a muggy day for the 132nd running of the Belmont Stakes yesterday, as well as a rich, competitive undercard of stakes races.</p>
        <p>That number was far below the record of 85,818 set last year when Charismatic was trying to sweep the Triple Crown, but was close to the 70,682 that attended the 1997 Belmont when Silver Charm was going for the sweep.</p>
        <p>''We were coming off a three-year run when Triple Crown opportunities provided significant appeal,'' said Terry Meyocks, the New York Racing Association president. ''The momentum, coupled with an outstanding lineup of quality racing, helped to provide a successful day for N.Y.R.A. and the industry.''</p>
        <p>Just a Game Breeders' Cup Handicap</p>
        <p>The trainer Joe Orseno may have held the Preakness winner, Red Bullet, out of the Belmont Stakes but he made his presence felt yesterday when Perfect Sting rallied to capture the Grade III $175,000 Just a Game Breeders' Cup Handicap.</p>
        <p>The filly out of Red Ransom swung wide in the stretch and caught Ronda to prevail by a nose in the one-mile turf race. She paid $3.30 for a $2 bet to win as the favorite. Orseno, who was released from the hospital after suffering symptoms of a hernia, said Perfect Sting's early traffic troubles made his stomach cramp all over again.</p>
        <p>''We knew when we decided to go in a mile race that traffic was the thing we had to worry about,'' Orseno said.</p>
        <p>His jockey, Jerry Bailey, also had some tough moments and joked that he was worried he would send Orseno back to the hospital. ''I wanted to get her out before the top of the stretch, but there was nowhere to go,'' Bailey said. ''I left her with a lot to do, but she certainly responded.''</p>
        <p>The Riva Ridge</p>
        <p>His 11th-place finish in the Kentucky Derby certainly did not take the heart out of Trippi, who buried a field of six in an impressive nine-length romp in the Riva Ridge, a Grade II seven-furlong sprint.</p>
        <p>It was Trippi's fifth victory in six starts and an impressive outing for both the colt and Bailey, his rider, who booted home his fourth consecutive winner on the Belmont Stakes undercard. The swift son of End Sweep took the lead from Captain Red at the half-mile point and extended it to five-and-one-half lengths out of the stretch and never looked back. For winning the $150,000 stakes race, Trippi paid $6.20 to win.</p>
        <p>''There was some people that questioned him running in the Derby,'' said Trippi's trainer, Todd Pletcher, ''and I thought that was a little unfair because he was 4 for 4 and had just won at a mile and an eighth. He might not be a mile and a quarter horse, but he's a pretty nice one.''</p>
        <p>Manhattan Handicap</p>
        <p>The Irish-bred Manndar waited patiently behind a dawdling early pace before exploding between rivals down the stretch to capture the $400,000 Grade I Manhattan Handicap.</p>
        <p>At the mile mark of the one-and-a-quarter-mile race, the jockey Corey Nakatani had the 4-year-old tucked inside in sixth place. Nakatani angled him wide at the top of the stretch and barreled between Yagli and the second-place finisher, Boatman. Manndar paid $8 for a $2 bet.</p>
        <p>''When you've got the best horse, things tend to go right,'' Nakatani said. ''I had the best horse here, and we got a good trip.''</p>
        <p>The True North</p>
        <p>In the best stretch duel of the day, Intidab outlasted Brutally Frank in a swift six-furlong sprint to win the $150,000 True North handicap. The 7-year-old from Phone Trick needed a four-wide slingshot move around the far turn to beat Brutally Frank to the top of the stretch. From there, he uncharacteristically ducked inside and held off his rival.</p>
        <p>''This horse runs so well on the outside, but when the leaders were drifting out, I had to take him inside to save ground,'' said the winning rider, Robbie Davis. ''But he cut the corner and accelerated.''</p>
