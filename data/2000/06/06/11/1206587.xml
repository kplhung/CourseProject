        <p>HAVE you checked your cable bill lately? Average rates have risen 33 percent over the last five years, and the pace shows few signs of letting up. That may irk the nearly 70 million cable subscribers in the United States, but it would seem to be good news for cable stock investors.</p>
        <p>So why is the Paul Kagan Associates index of cable company stocks down 21.8 percent this year through Friday, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index is flat? Investors see problems for the industry, especially in the growing popularity of satellite television providers like Hughes Electronics' DirecTV and EchoStar Communications' Dish Network. Not helping is a recent poll by the Yankee Group, a research firm, that showed 46 percent of satellite subscribers rated their service as excellent, versus just 15 percent for cable subscribers.</p>

        <p>HAVE you checked your cable bill lately? Average rates have risen 33 percent over the last five years, and the pace shows few signs of letting up. That may irk the nearly 70 million cable subscribers in the United States, but it would seem to be good news for cable stock investors.</p>
        <p>So why is the Paul Kagan Associates index of cable company stocks down 21.8 percent this year through Friday, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index is flat? Investors see problems for the industry, especially in the growing popularity of satellite television providers like Hughes Electronics' DirecTV and EchoStar Communications' Dish Network. Not helping is a recent poll by the Yankee Group, a research firm, that showed 46 percent of satellite subscribers rated their service as excellent, versus just 15 percent for cable subscribers.</p>
        <p>But none of that should dissuade investors from ponying up for the shares of one cable company, according to some analysts and money managers. They say Cablevision Systems, the Bethpage, N.Y., company that provides service to 2.9 million people in the New York area, should bear up better than most cable companies under the satellite onslaught.</p>
        <p>''They're one of the least-vulnerable cable companies out there,'' said Tom Eagan, a PaineWebber analyst who recently upgraded his recommendation on the stock.</p>
        <p>The number of Cablevision subscribers grew 2.4 percent in the first quarter, versus 2 percent growth for the industry, even as satellite companies were heavily promoting their services in the metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>Cablevision benefits because good satellite reception is relatively hard to get in urban areas like New York.  But the company has also been rolling out enhanced analog set-top boxes that allow subscribers to receive as many as 110 channels, versus about 50 with its old boxes. And it is converting its network to digital, which will improve picture resolution, and plans to introduce Sony digital boxes later this year that provide still more channels.</p>
        <p>''They're going to be the first cable provider that converts to 100 percent digital, which will give them an enormous amount of capacity that will really dwarf every other network,'' said Ray Katz, an analyst at Bear Stearns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eagan expects Cablevision's pro-forma earnings before interest,  depreciation and amortization to hit $1.3 billion in 2001, up 18 percent from this year. At $68.9375, its shares are down 8.7 percent this year, trading for just 10 times his estimate of 2000 cash flow, low enough to prompt takeover talk.</p>
        <p>Cablevision itself is selling its Cleveland system to Adelphia Communications for $1.53 billion. In April, it agreed to swap its Boston system with AT&amp;T for 125,500 customers in the northern suburbs of New York City, plus $878 million in AT&amp;T stock and $284 million cash. Mr. Eagan values the deals at roughly 20 times cash flow, far higher than Cablevision's own multiple; he notes that the swap will strengthen its grip on the metropolitan market.</p>
        <p>FOCUSING on one market is a risky strategy, one that could set up Cablevision for a tumble should the New York City economy -- dangerously dependent on Wall Street -- falter. But the New York market is the most lucrative in the nation, and Cablevision's geographic focus has let it develop a kind of vertical integration that is unprecedented in the cable business, allowing for profitable synergies. No other company has tried to build the type of multimedia network -- cable, entertainment, telephone and Internet access -- that Cablevision executives are seeking.</p>
        <p>The synergies come in part from Cablevision's 74 percent interest in Rainbow Media Holdings, owner of  Madison Square Garden, its cable network and the three professional sports teams -- the Rangers, the Knicks and the Liberty -- that play there. Rainbow also owns Radio City Entertainment and holds stakes in the American Movie Classics and Bravo cable channels.</p>
        <p>Cablevision itself owns some high profile New York properties, including Clearview Cinemas and the Wiz, the electronics retailer.</p>
        <p>The benefits of its intertwined holdings can add up. Knicks games, for example, are often shown exclusively on the MSG Network, allowing the company to avoid paying for expensive broadcast rights. The Wiz sells cable modem systems at a steep discount, fostering the galloping growth of Cablevision's high-speed cable Internet service, which has more than 70,500 subscribers. And Lightpath, Cablevision's fledgling local phone company, could provide more of the cross-pollination that has already impressed analysts.</p>
        <p>''They're really leveraging their properties off one another,'' said Robert G. Routh, an analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann. ''They're basically becoming New York's entertainment company.''</p>
        <p>Jim Jundt, portfolio manager at Jundt Associates, a money management firm in St. Louis Park, Minn., said: ''New York is a unique situation, and they own some unique properties. I think they are doing a smart thing.'' He has about 2.5 percent of his firm's assets in Cablevision, which he says is worth $123 a share.</p>
        <p>THE company is planning to shuffle more assets. It expects to issue a tracking stock in August to represent the earnings stream of its Rainbow Media stake, but Cablevision does not expect Madison Square Garden or its sports teams to be included in the deal. That would let Cablevision monetize some of the programming assets it controls, which typically trade for far higher multiples than cable systems.</p>
        <p>Still, it is unclear how long Cablevision will remain independent. AT&amp;T already owns more than 30 percent of its stock, and has been buying cable systems. Time Warner controls the most profitable piece of New York's cable market, Manhattan, so it has also been mentioned as a possible acquirer.</p>
        <p>Charles S. Dolan, chairman of Cablevision, and his son James L. Dolan, chief executive, together with their family, control 80 percent of its voting shares. They have declined to comment on any possible sale.</p>
        <p>''If they want to sell it, you won't have to worry about buyers because there will be a line of them,'' said Mr. Katz, the Bear Stearns analyst. He figures that Cablevision would probably fetch twice its current price if acquired. Absent a buyout, he has a 12-month target of $85 to $90 on the stock.</p>
