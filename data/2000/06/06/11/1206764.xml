        <p>Dale Eggeling, drawing on valuable childhood lessons playing golf in swirling winds, shot an even-par 72 and opened up a two-stroke lead yesterday at the Rochester International.</p>
        <p>Winds gusting to 30 miles an hour played havoc with the leaderboard at the tree-lined Locust Hill course in Pittsford, N.Y. Benefiting from low-bore drives and a few clutch putts, Eggeling moved to five-under-par 211.</p>
        <p>Meg Mallon, an 11-time tour winner, also shot a 72 to claim sole second spot at three under, two ahead of Cindy Figg-Currier (72). Five others were at even-par 216, including Rosie Jones (74), who won here in 1991 and 1998.</p>
        <p>KITE FINISHES STRONG: Tom Kite battled through heavy winds, birdied four of the last five holes and took a one-stroke lead at the SBC Senior Open yesterday in Long Grove, Ill.</p>
        <p>Kite, whose four-under 68 tied for the second-best round of the day, was at five-under-par 139, one stroke ahead of Graham Marsh.</p>
        <p>John Bland, Bruce Fleisher and Bruce Summerhays are at three under.</p>
