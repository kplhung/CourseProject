        <p>ALEX HAN arrives at the local jazz club, Trumpets, with his two signature instruments, his alto saxophone and a Nintendo Gameboy. Invited onstage by the Ray Alexander Quartet, he calls out the tune and snaps, setting the tempo. With his small, wing-tipped foot tapping, he rips into an upbeat ''Girl From Ipanema'' and burns through a solo, inciting a frenzy in the audience.</p>
        <p>Utterly focused, fingers flying over the black-lacquered Yamaha horn, his youthful features belie his soulful, passionate jazz interpretations. Accommodating audience pleas, he plays two more tunes, Gershwin's ''Summertime'' and Kurt Weill's ''Speak Low,'' before bowing and shaking hands with the jazz veterans onstage: Ray Alexander, vibrophonist; Rio Clemente, pianist; Russ Moy, percussionist; and Bill Crow, bass. Then he retires to a table in the back of the club to sip a Coca-Cola, play with his Gameboy and sign autographs. A routine Saturday evening for a 12-year-old jazz prodigy.</p>
        <p>Alex began performing publicly just over a year ago when he was discovered by Mr. Moy at an Easter brunch performance. ''Alex's teacher at the time, Jimmy Giacone, asked if one of his young students could play with us,'' Mr. Moy remembered. ''I was skeptical and asked if he had any experience. Well, eight bars into the tune, I realized he was special. His phrasing, intonation and knowledge of jazz absolutely knocked me out.''</p>
        <p>Since then, Alex has performed with a number of famous musicians at top showplaces, like Lincoln Center and the Blue Note in Manhattan. Recently, he was chosen as one of two national recipients of the VSA Arts Panasonic Young Soloist Award, and played for a public service announcement with the actress Marlee Matlin.</p>
        <p>Attention deficit disorder was diagnosed in Alex when he was 4 years old. John Han and his wife, Luisa, wanted to provide their son with some structure and a creative outlet. ''We didn't want Alex sitting on the couch watching TV,'' Mrs. Han said. ''As a parent you try to keep your kids busy. We had no idea it would turn out like this.''</p>
        <p>When he was 7, his parents introduced him to the saxophone. But, too small to handle the instrument, he played the recorder, instead. A year later, Alex tried the saxophone again and began taking private lessons. By age 9, the Hans knew their son was gifted. ''I believe in myself and I know I can be a really good sax player, but it takes a lot of courage,'' Alex said. ''I want to be better than Charlie Parker.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giacone, Alex's former teacher, characterizes him as an emotional player, unusual for someone so young. Mr. Giacone taught his student to sight read and introduced him to the music of the jazz greats. ''Alex has a very good ear,'' Mr. Giacone said. ''Once he hears something, he can instantly reproduce it. He didn't understand things about chords, but he could hear them and find notes to match.''</p>
        <p>Now Alex studies with Gottfried Stoger, of the J.C.C. Thurnauer School of Music in Englewood. ''Alex works hard and he has great instincts,'' Mr. Stoger said. ''He is sincerely dealing with music. He needs to learn theory and gain knowledge of his instrument. He also needs some classical training.'' Talent like Alex's comes along maybe twice in a teacher's lifetime, he said.</p>
        <p>''Alex's musical future depends on a lot more than training,'' he said. ''Families push their kids and they become wunderkinds and can run into trouble, stunting personal growth. Success depends on the life balance and emotional development, when you're dealing with a young player.''</p>
        <p>The Hans are doing their best to shape their son's musical growth, accompanying him to every lesson and performance, even cleaning and polishing his instrument.</p>
        <p>They also try to provide him with a normal life, scheduling ''play days'' free from his saxophone. ''His gift has not taken over our lives,'' Mr. Han said. ''We encourage him, but we try not to enforce it upon him. I've only just begun to play jazz in the car when I drive him to school. When we go to a record store, he chooses whatever he wants, which may be a Disney selection. It's just ironic that someone who doesn't listen to jazz, doesn't know the players, can play jazz like this.''</p>
        <p>As for the emotional maturity necessary to play such a sophisticated genre, Mrs. Han said with a shrug, ''It's gotta be God.''</p>
        <p>The disciplined sixth-grader at Tenafly Middle School practices at least two hours daily -- in the morning before school, and after he finishes his homework in the evening. ''I don't really like to practice,'' Alex said, ''but, when I start playing songs, I really enjoy it.'' When not preparing to become a jazz legend, Alex rides his bike, plays video games and watches Saturday morning cartoons with his 4-year-old brother, Cameron.</p>
        <p>His immediate future holds more local and international gigs, including a jazz festival in Uruguay next January with the saxophonist Paquito D'Rivera.</p>
        <p>''If he keeps this up, he'll be a monster player,'' Mr. Clemente said. ''He's got real natural ability. That's the 'it.' People can strive their whole lives to try to improvise. Alex can do it naturally.''</p>
        <p>The jazz veterans who share gigs with Mr. Han respect his musicianship and are enjoying his evolution. ''I've seen two sides of Alex,'' Mr. Moy said. ''I'm used to him telling knock-knock jokes and playing with his Gameboy at gigs. But, recently, when Alex heard a trombonist play, he said, 'I really dug your playing, can I have your card?' Now, that's progress.''</p>
