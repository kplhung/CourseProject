        <p>IN the back room of a dingy pub, on a darkened street in the northern reaches of the Bronx, one can get a glimpse of life on the rolling Irish heath.</p>
        <p>There, wearing a placid smile, Hugh Doonan, born in Brooklyn to Irish parents 68 years ago, plays the bodhran, a simple drum of stretched goatskin, in time to the music of a makeshift band. The sounds conjure images of dirt roads, first kisses and waves lapping against a jagged shore.</p>
        <p>About 40 people have traveled from as far  as Westchester and New Jersey on a rainy night to gather at Gaelic Park, this pub on the outskirts of Van Cortland Park, to participate in a ceili, an evening of Irish folk dancing. As the music plays, dancers line up in facing rows to begin the ''Siege of Ennis.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, ceilis (pronounced KAY-lees) have attracted increasing numbers of people from all walks of life to places like Gaelic Park, as well as to Queens bars like  the Cork Lounge in Long Island City and St. Margaret's in Middle Village. John P. McGurrin, chairman of the Killoran-Clancy Branch of Comhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann, an organization that promotes Celtic traditions, said the dance has exploded in popularity in the last five years.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGurrin has been teaching ceili for a decade. When he started, he had so few students he feared he might not be able to hold regular classes. Now he has 40 people in his beginner class, and he plans to start a second class for advanced students.</p>
        <p>A ceili, which means ''neighborly visit'' in Gaelic, is an event and a dance. One goes to a ceili for two kinds of dances: ceili and set dances. Ceilis, mostly line dances and circle dances, are native to Ireland. Set dances, which usually involve partners, were adapted from the quadrilles and cotillions brought to Ireland in the 19th century by soldiers returning from European wars.</p>
        <p>The ceili and set dances are a portal to both the past and the future. Many are attracted to the folk dances as vestiges of Irish culture that were repressed under British rule. ''Into the 19th century, the British discouraged any overt signs of Irishness,'' said Paul Keating, the New York and New Jersey regional chairman of Comhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann. ''And dancing was one of them.''</p>
        <p>But many of them see the dance as a cultural bridge to the future.</p>
        <p>At the far end of Gaelic Park, three generations of the Moore clan, which originally came from County Leitrim in Ireland and now lives in Riverdale, Throgs Neck and parts of Westchester County, are trying to guide their youngest member, Shane Slattery, 2, through the basic dance moves: seven small steps forward, seven back; meet your partner in the middle, hold his elbow in your palm, do a little twirl, return to your station. But Shane, blond and bewildered, mostly runs in circles from one relative to the next, delighted by the attention.</p>
        <p>Shane represents the fifth generation in his family to learn the dances associated with his heritage. His grandmother, Mary Holt Moore, is vice president of Conradh na Gaeilge 'sa Bhroncs (the Bronx Gaelic League), a group founded in 1940 to promote Irish culture.</p>
        <p>Each of Mrs. Moore's 17 grandchildren has spent time dancing at Gaelic Park. In the old country, many Irish people met their future spouses at ceilis; these days, Irish families use them to help those in the younger generation learn about their roots.</p>
        <p>''The action is fast, and it feels good to be doing what all my family has been doing, my ancestors,'' said Shane's cousin Maureen McNulty, 9. ''It makes me feel like I'm going through the tradition. It keeps the family meaning going.''</p>
