        <p>The Yankees were playing as if they needed a cold shower yesterday. They were listless and lost, allowing the Mets to march in front of them on a day when Bobby Valentine had the unexplainable confidence to start Bobby Jones and when George Steinbrenner did not even bother to show up for a clash that means more to him than anyone else.</p>
        <p>It was not Mike Piazza beating the Yankees, which at least would have been understandable. It was the Yankees beating themselves as Jones desperately tried to last five innings on a muggy afternoon. Jones, the disappointing pitcher who should be removed from the rotation immediately, never made it, even though the Yankees were surprisingly worse than he was for a portion of their 13-5 victory.</p>

        <p>The Yankees were playing as if they needed a cold shower yesterday. They were listless and lost, allowing the Mets to march in front of them on a day when Bobby Valentine had the unexplainable confidence to start Bobby Jones and when George Steinbrenner did not even bother to show up for a clash that means more to him than anyone else.</p>
        <p>It was not Mike Piazza beating the Yankees, which at least would have been understandable. It was the Yankees beating themselves as Jones desperately tried to last five innings on a muggy afternoon. Jones, the disappointing pitcher who should be removed from the rotation immediately, never made it, even though the Yankees were surprisingly worse than he was for a portion of their 13-5 victory.</p>
        <p>Andy Pettitte behaved like a Little League bully screaming at the bored center fielder when Bernie Williams broke in on Todd Zeile's bullet in the fifth inning. Pettitte backpedaled from the mound, waved his left hand and yelled, ''Back, back, back.'' It did not matter. Zeile's ball sailed over Williams's glove and the go-ahead run scored.</p>
        <p>Tino Martinez botched a grounder, which led to another run. Pettitte gave up a two-run lead as if he were giving away free water. Ricky Ledee made an out on the first pitch after Pettitte had labored through a 33-pitch inning. Wilson Delgado failed to slide on a close play at second. The game was half over, the Mets were ahead, 5-3, and a disastrous weekend was creeping up on the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''We were,'' Derek Jeter said, ''embarrassed.''</p>
        <p>But, in one blitz of an inning, the Yankees showed why they are still the superior team in New York and why they should be relaxed rolling into tonight's series finale. Even with David Cone trying to prove that he is still a reliable pitcher as an important backdrop in this marquee matchup, tonight's game became easier when Jorge Posada crushed a three-run homer to break open a 5-5 tie, helping the Yankees to wake up and assert themselves.</p>
        <p>Yes, there was relief in Yankeeland. No matter how many times the Yankees uttered that these games count the same as a series against the Twins and that their focus is on the Red Sox, these skirmishes are different. They are taxing, draining, memorable. Neither team would want to deal with the stigma of being swept, but it would be much worse for the two-time World Series champions. Why? Because Steinbrenner does not own the Mets.</p>
        <p>''For the city and the fans, it was good,'' Pettitte said. ''If we had lost today, we could have gotten swept. You don't ever want to get swept. It would have been more magnified with the Mets.''</p>
        <p>After Paul O'Neill and Williams had two-out, run-scoring hits to even the score at 5-5 in the fifth, Posada batted against Pat Mahomes with two runners on. The count drifted to 3-2. Todd Pratt signaled for a changeup, but Mahomes shook him off for a fastball. It was supposed to be inside, but the ball strayed over the middle of the plate and Posada sent it into the right-field upper deck.</p>
        <p>Posada was delirious. He flipped the bat into the air and slapped the first base coach Lee Mazzilli's hand as if it were a punching bag. He rumbled around the bases as Yankee Stadium rumbled beneath his feet, he skipped back to the dugout and he tapped his chest twice.</p>
        <p>''That was a bomb,'' Jeter gushed. ''He deserved to do cartwheels around the bases.''</p>
        <p>One day after Piazza's grand slam off Roger Clemens helped the Mets win, Posada hit a shot that was almost as majestic to help the Yankees prevail. Jeter said the comparison between the catchers provides reporters with a ''good story,'' but nothing more. Piazza does not pitch to Posada and vice versa. Still, there has to be motivation. Just as Jeter wants to play better against Nomar Garciaparra, Posada surely wanted to play better when Piazza makes his only visit to the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''I can't compare myself to Piazza,'' Posada said sheepishly. ''I just relax and do what I can do.''</p>
        <p>Pettitte retired six straight Mets after Posada's homer sparked a five-run fifth inning, and the Yankees kept attacking. They scored one in the sixth and four in the seventh, pounding the Mets the way they were pounded on Friday. It had looked gloomy for the Yankees when they played sluggishly for four and a half innings, but they showed their resiliency and superiority with a Lakers-like spurt of 10 straight runs.</p>
        <p>''It's a sign of a good team,'' Williams said. ''After the loss we had last night, we had to come back and regroup and get stronger and we did that.''</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, who is always calm, admitted there was a sense of urgency in the Yankees' dugout, an urgency to get a good performance from Pettitte. The manager said the Yankees had not been worried about their early ragged play or about the possibility of a sweep. But that was a lot easier for Torre to say after the Yankees won and ensured themselves of a little more peace.</p>
        <p>''As far as losing because of what George says,'' said Torre, pausing and shrugging, ''I think losing is enough of a torture for us.''</p>
