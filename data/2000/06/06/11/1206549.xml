        <p>The subject was helping people afford prescription drugs. But the object was getting Vice President Al Gore a promotion.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore is taking them on,'' the announcer declared, ''fighting for a Medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors like Bob Darthez.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Darthez, a 74-year-old Medicare recipient, were the star players in the first national commercial of the general election, a 30-second spot by the Democratic National Committee that ran this weekend in 15 states, including Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio, all considered especially decisive this fall.</p>
        <p>Democrats say the advertising offensive that runs until the conventions in late July and August will cost them at least $25 million. Some of that will be paid with soft money, the unrestricted donations that corporations, individuals and unions can make to the parties.</p>
        <p>In a March 14 e-mail message, Mr. Gore had challenged Gov. George W. Bush to a bilateral ban on the use of soft money to pay for issue commercials. So Republicans were only too happy to point out that the vice president was the first to go back on the offer. But Mr. Gore asserted that he could not be bound by a proposal that Mr. Bush had rejected. (The exchange occurred just as the Senate was approving a campaign finance reform measure, imposing financial disclosure requirements on tax-exempt special interest groups that raise and spend money secretly on political activities.)</p>
        <p>At week's end, the Republicans were preparing to unveil their own ''party-building'' ads on behalf of Mr. Bush, to run in all the states in which Mr. Gore and Mr. Darthez are appearing.</p>
        <p>For all the rancor over campaign spending, however, Republicans were making plans for a national party convention in Philadelphia that is to feature a lot more celebration than denigration. The convention's traditional ''attack'' night, reserved for giving the rival candidate a pasting, will be replaced with unending hurrahs for the party's standard-bearer, Republicans said.</p>
        <p>''Each night will have a positive discussion of Governor Bush's proposals,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director.</p>
        <p>In other words, one long feel-good commercial.</p>
