      <abstract>
        <p>British band Cure, led by Robert Smith, will perform at PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, NJ, and Blockbuster Sony Entertainment Center in Camden (S)</p>

        <p>Some music lovers look for uplifting concert experiences, hoping to get caught up in exhilarating transport. Others, like fans of the British band the Cure, like to wallow in misery, at home and in stadiums. Well, New Jersey Goths can rejoice, or to be precise, they can find something less horrible than daily existence to look forward to, because Robert Smith and his Cure are coming to the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel at 8 p.m. Friday and the Blockbuster Sony Entertainment Center in Camden at 8 p.m. next Sunday.</p>
        <p>The odd Mr. Smith, the band's leader, is a dark and moody androgynous dreamboat to some and a grotesque-looking Edward Scissorhands clone to others. Since 1979, his various incarnations of the band have served up angst and melancholia.</p>
        <p>Misery does love company.</p>
