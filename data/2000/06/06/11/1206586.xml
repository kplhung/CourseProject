        <p>COUPONS. Cue-pons.</p>
        <p>No matter how one says the word, it does not exactly send shivers down most investors' spines. For chat-room tyros who expect to make their first million day-trading by age 27, paging through the Sunday newspaper with a pair of scissors just to save a couple of cents on Cheetos seems so, well, old economy.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to Valassis Communications, a quiet favorite of Wall Street analysts and some mutual fund managers, including Mark Greenberg of the the $550 million Invesco Leisure fund. Valassis is Mr. Greenberg's third-largest holding.</p>
        <p>''It's a very good business, a very good company that no one on Wall Street cares about,'' Mr. Greenberg said. But he expects that to change over time, as Valassis turns in steady growth. ''It's an absurdly cheap stock,'' he said, noting that shares trade at less than half the price-to-earnings multiple of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.</p>
        <p>Based in Livonia, Mich., Valassis has about half the market for printing and distributing the coupon inserts that fatten Sunday newspapers nationwide. Valassis splits the coupon distribution market about evenly with News America, a division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and neither company is particularly aggressive on price, analysts say.</p>
        <p>''It's competition, but it's not ferocious competition. It's not too much of a price-competition business,'' said Troy Mastin, an analyst at Raymond James, a brokerage firm based in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''I think they both understand that if they get aggressive on price, there's a response from the other.''</p>
        <p>Yet the business remains extremely difficult for new entrants to crack, because it has relatively high fixed costs that cannot be recouped without a critical mass of advertisers, Mr. Mastin said. And most potential advertisers are tied to Valassis or the News Corporation by contracts more than a year long. So since the early 1990's, when a would-be competitor lost more than $50 million trying to enter the market, Valassis and News have had the coupon industry pretty much to themselves.</p>
        <p>As a result, Valassis' gross profit margins were almost 40 percent of sales last year, and its net income was 15 percent of sales. The company earned $121 million, or $2.04 a share, on sales of $794 million. Even better, that per-share profit figure was up 35 percent from 1998.</p>
        <p>This year, analysts expect the gains to continue. Officially, most analysts expect Valassis to earn $2.43 a share in 2000, but Valassis has a habit of beating posted estimates, and their unofficial consensus is closer to $2.50. Valassis shares closed on Friday at $35.0625, so even if the company does nothing more than meet official estimates for the year, it is trading at just over 14 times earnings.</p>
        <p>''They've got a very strong track record of growing earnings in excess of 20 percent,'' said Edward Atorino, an analyst at Wasserstein Perella Securities. ''It's been one of my favorite stocks.''</p>
        <p>In addition, the nature of the coupon business means that Valassis is likely to prosper whether the United States economy is strong or weak. ''In recessionary times, coupons are used to move product,'' Mr. Mastin said. ''In good times, there tend to be more new product rollouts.''</p>
        <p>Then there is the Internet, which is both an opportunity and a threat to Valassis. So-called reverse auction companies like Priceline WebHouse Club, which theoretically enable consumers to ''name their own price'' for groceries, have the potential to take business from Valassis. On the other hand, Valassis is testing Internet coupons at its majority-owned Web site, save.com, and the results so far have been promising, Mr. Mastin said. Because Internet coupons have no printing or distribution costs, gross margins on them could top 90 percent for Valassis, he said.</p>
        <p>It is still too early to tell whether Valassis will be a winner in the Internet coupon business, Mr. Greenberg said. However, given the health of the company's core printed coupon business, he is not worrying unduly about the matter.</p>
