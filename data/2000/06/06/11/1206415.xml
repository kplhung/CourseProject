        <p>IF this be the year of Tomas Straussler -- on Broadway, in Connecticut, in London -- will the play ''Rough Crossing'' finally have its day?</p>
        <p>Just as the supremely well-known playwright Tom Stoppard may not have a household birth name, his play, now at Hartford Stage, is better known as ''The Play's the Thing,'' P.G. Wodehouse's 1926 adaptation of a 1924 romantic operetta-style comedy (read sex farce) by the Hungarian playwright Ferenc Molnar.</p>
        <p>Even though Mr. Stoppard wrote ''Rough Crossing'' in 1984, two years after ''The Real Thing'' won its first round of awards, attention was not paid to the ever-dazzling playwright's resetting of an established trifle from a castle -- even that play had an original name, ''The Play at the Castle'' -- on a luxury liner.</p>
        <p>On a showboat where puns and non sequiturs float and all pseudo-creative temperaments sink, a Broadway-bound musical is being woefully rewritten and frenetically rehearsed. The faux musical, with three songs by Andre Previn, was obviously playtime for an intellectually weighty playwright, whose wordplay in this work is more felicitous and frivolous than deeply intended.</p>
        <p>Perhaps theatergoers weren't primed for Stoppard lite.</p>
        <p>The failed ''Rough Crossing'' had a short run in London, then landed in Brooklyn six years later, in a streamlined staging. Seven years after that, an Off Off Broadway production on the Lower East Side followed. But Broadway or Off Broadway, never.</p>
        <p>Now ''The Real Thing'' has made a dazzling sweep of the Tony Awards: best revival, best actor, best actress. That was last Sunday.</p>
        <p>On May 9, Mr. Stoppard received the Order of Merit from Queen Elizabeth; it is considered the queen's personal gift.</p>
        <p>And, on May 22, Yale University conferred an honorary doctorate on Mr. Stoppard. It ought to be redundant to be reminded of last year's Oscar for co-writing the ''Shakespeare in Love'' screenplay, but not everyone knows that ''Indian Ink,'' also by Tom Stoppard, won a Helen Hayes Award in Washington, D.C. this year.</p>
        <p>For that matter, how many people know ''Indian Ink'' (1995)?</p>
        <p>Since Hartford Stage announced ''Rough Crossing'' before Mr. Stoppard's most recent amassing of honors, the obvious question is: Why?</p>
        <p>''Tracy and I were looking for a comedy,'' said the company's artistic director, Michael Wilson, referring to the play's director, Tracy Brigden. They were actually looking Noel Coward's way, with the Coward centennial in mind. But one thing or another led to ''Rough Crossing,'' which critics have compared to Coward. Mr. Wilson admits the play is ''very Coward-y.''</p>
        <p>''When I read it,'' Mr. Wilson continued, ''I howled.'' He said he was charmed by Mr. Stoppard's ''love of theater, his celebration of its craziness, of its eccentric personalities.''</p>
        <p>Admitting that the play ''isn't the emotional roller coaster ride of 'The Real Thing','' Mr. Wilson said he was dazzled by its ''buoyancy and straightforwardness and what an accomplished farce it is.'' ''It is not complex,'' he added, ''it is not confusing.''</p>
        <p>For all that, the play is not the thing here, it is the production.</p>
        <p>Minor Stoppard, anyway you see it, ''Rough Crossing'' sinks or floats on direction and farcical elan. In regional productions, it sank at the Westport Playhouse in 1990 -- but it floated at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., in 1994. Reviewers of the Hartford production were divided, with an emphasis on the favorable. Ms. Brigden's production is a hybrid, Mr. Wilson said, blending the original version, with chorus, and a revision, without. ''Tracy added chorus here and there.'' Mr. Stoppard phoned in his blessing.</p>
        <p>The Hartford production has six principals and six chorus members. ''And a live piano, a baby grand,'' Mr. Wilson added, reminding one of Mr. Previn's score, something new, not borrowed, for the occasion. ''It's more of a musical than 'Contact','' he had to agree.</p>
        <p>''Rough Crossing,'' Hartford Stage, 50 Church Street, Hartford; 860-527-5151. Performances through June 24.</p>
