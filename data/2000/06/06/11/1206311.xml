        <p>No more staring at closed elevator doors, repeatedly pressing a call button in frustration.

        <p>Otis Elevator Company plans to liberate the elevator -- and the elevator rider -- by letting them skip sideways from shaft to shaft. They imagine cars moving up and down buildings like roadsters on a freeway rather than buckets in a well.</p>
        <p>This makes several things possible. First, it allows multiple elevators to occupy a hoistway at any one time, which means that not only does the ratio of cars to riders in a building increase (think back to the dozen people crammed crankily into your elevator each morning) but also that the halting progress of the one-car-one-shaft system can be made obsolete. If you're traveling up to the 75th floor, for example, and above you there are cars stopping on 17, 28, 39 and 57, then the computer on your car, in constant communication with the others, will read the situation and adjust accordingly, sliding laterally into a neighboring shaft and keeping you on the move.</p>
        <p>The addition of horizontal travel -- what Otis calls the Odyssey system -- works best in taller buildings (Malaysia's Petronas Towers is currently the world's tallest at 1,483 feet, but there are plans in the works for taller structures to go up in Chicago and S</p>
