        <p>GUTTERS are an important part of any house. They capture rainwater running down from the roof and they route it through the downspouts away from the house. This helps to keep basements and crawl spaces dry, prevent topsoil erosion and shield windows and doors from water penetration.</p>
        <p>Gutters should be inspected and cleaned twice a year: once in the fall to remove leaves and debris accumulated from shedding trees and again in the spring to make sure they are able to handle the heavy rains of spring and summer.</p>

        <p>GUTTERS are an important part of any house. They capture rainwater running down from the roof and they route it through the downspouts away from the house. This helps to keep basements and crawl spaces dry, prevent topsoil erosion and shield windows and doors from water penetration.</p>
        <p>Gutters should be inspected and cleaned twice a year: once in the fall to remove leaves and debris accumulated from shedding trees and again in the spring to make sure they are able to handle the heavy rains of spring and summer.</p>
        <p>When inspecting the gutters, check for accumulations of debris, downspout clogs, leaks and sags. Sags usually occur because the gutter is insufficiently supported by hangers (There should be a hanger every 30 inches along the gutter run) or because the hangers that are in place loosen and give way.</p>
        <p>Other things to check for are proper slope and rust damage. In order to provide proper drainage, the gutters should slope toward the downspouts one inch for every 20 feet.</p>
        <p>Metal gutters with rust damage should be repaired before the rust eats through the base of the gutter. Use a wire brush or abrasive pad to remove the rust, then prime and paint the area. Holes must be patched with either metal or fiberglass then painted.</p>
        <p>Gutters with extensive rust and holes should be replaced. If you have to replace your damaged gutters, you may be tempted to install new gutters exactly like the one you already have. However, it is wise to shop around. Gutters manufactured today are available in a wide variety of materials and styles and it's good to consider your options before you buy. Gutters are made out of galvanized steel, aluminum, stainless steel, vinyl, copper and wood. They are either sectional or seamless.</p>
        <p>Galvanized steel gutters are the most economical; they cost about $4 to $8 a linear foot installed. They are structurally rigid, so they can stand up the impact of ladders and falling branches better than aluminum can. Their main drawback is that unless they are properly maintained, the galvanized coating will eventually wear through and the gutters will rust.</p>
        <p>Aluminum gutters are a little more expensive, $5 to $9 a linear foot installed. They are not as rigid as galvanized steel, but this is not a concern unless you do a lot of roof work and lean a ladder against them. With aluminum gutters, you never have to worry about rust. Some companies offer gutters made with either primary or secondary aluminum. Gutters made with primary aluminum are the better choice because the thickness of the stock is consistent. Secondary aluminum gutters, on the other hand, are made from recycled metal and they vary in thickness.</p>
        <p>Stainless steel gutters may be an option if you can afford them. They cost about $20 a linear foot, but they are rugged and rust-  and maintenance-free.</p>
        <p>Most metal gutters range in thickness from 0.019 inch to 0.032 inch. When buying new gutters, choose those with the thickest metal that you can afford. Thin-metal gutters are not very durable and may soon have to be replaced.</p>
        <p>Vinyl gutters are a good choice for do-it-yourself installation because they are lightweight and easy to cut to size. They are impervious to rust, but they can get brittle with age and are likely to crack in extreme cold. They cost about $3 to $5 a linear foot installed.</p>
        <p>Copper and wood gutters are made for restoration work. Those with period houses who want to maintain their authenticity may choose to install gutters made of these materials. Copper gutters are frequently installed on historic houses because they are stately, durable and never need painting. They are also expensive, costing about $15 a linear foot to install. Wood gutters are made from redwood, red cedar and Douglas fir. You must coat the gutters with linseed oil every year or they weather badly. Wood gutters are not cheap. They may cost anywhere from $12 to $20 a linear foot to have them installed.</p>
        <p>Metal and vinyl gutters are available in either sectional form or they can be extruded into long seamless lengths. Sectional gutters are preformed and sold in pieces. Basically, sectional gutters are sold as component systems with caps, snap-in connectors, corner pieces and drop outlets. The components with snap fittings make it easy for the do-it-yourselfer to install. The downside to sectional gutters is that they are prone to leak at the seams.</p>
        <p>In contrast, extruded gutters have no seams (for this reason they are often called seamless gutters). Extruded gutters come as sheet stock in a tight roll. The metal, galvanized steel, aluminum or copper is cranked through a machine that bends it into a shape called a profile. The two most common gutter profiles are the U and K shape. Because extruded gutters require special machinery, they can only be installed by a professional.</p>
