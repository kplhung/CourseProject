        <p>A REVIEWER'S lot is not always a happy one. A terrific restaurant is discovered, praised and then kissed good-bye, usually forever. Another awaits. Five years ago, I swooned over Villa Doria in Bellmore. Now, with the arrival of new owners, chef and staff, another visit was called for.</p>
        <p>The place looks much as it did: a somewhat drab dining room with a more inviting glassed-in porch, overlooking a canal. Flowers were always a hallmark of Villa Doria and still are. A sideboard holds a dozen or more bouquets, just as it did in the past. But there are somewhat fewer flowers elsewhere; among the missing is the focal point arrangement on the bar, which once greeted diners.</p>

        <p>A REVIEWER'S lot is not always a happy one. A terrific restaurant is discovered, praised and then kissed good-bye, usually forever. Another awaits. Five years ago, I swooned over Villa Doria in Bellmore. Now, with the arrival of new owners, chef and staff, another visit was called for.</p>
        <p>The place looks much as it did: a somewhat drab dining room with a more inviting glassed-in porch, overlooking a canal. Flowers were always a hallmark of Villa Doria and still are. A sideboard holds a dozen or more bouquets, just as it did in the past. But there are somewhat fewer flowers elsewhere; among the missing is the focal point arrangement on the bar, which once greeted diners.</p>
        <p>Villa Doria is about more than flowers and waterfront ambience.  Food is the big story here, and that's where the new regime stumbles. It's difficult for any newcomer to live up to a fondly remembered favorite, but using any measure, the food falls short.</p>
        <p>Take the menu item called lobster in paradise. Ours should have been labeled the lobster from hell. The seafood was mushy, almost runny, and stuck to its shell. These are signs that the lobster was not alive when it hit the cooking pot. Just as bad was the seafood fra diavolo over pasta.  The mussels in the assembly tasted old, and their strong flavor permeated and ruined the whole dish. The diner who ordered it, a big fellow who always cleans his plate, left most of this catastrophe. (''That's a first,'' his wife said.)</p>
        <p>Also coming up short were an overcooked St. Peter's fish in an assertive crust of sun-dried tomatoes and black olives, which overwhelmed the delicate fish, and a New York strip steak glazed with Gorgonzola cheese and crowned with French-fried onion rings. It was ordered medium rare but was gray throughout.</p>
        <p>Not everything was a disaster.  There were a few creations that sparkled and a good number that passed muster. Beginnings and endings were better than entrees. Tops among the starters were smoked salmon rosettes perched on buckwheat blini, a beet and goat cheese timbale escorted by baby greens and a plate of tender, crisp rings of fried calamari.</p>
        <p>Steamed mussels crowned with a slab of grilled bread were sweet and plump, and baked clams were given a flavor boost by a drizzle of lemon oil. The shrimp cocktail of four firm jumbos was commendable, as was the Caesar salad of whole romaine leaves in a spunky dressing with a Parmesan crisp topper.</p>
        <p>The field greens with poached pear, walnuts and shaved ricotta salata, though, were rendered too sweet by a sticky port wine reduction. A vegetable bisque made from turnips, carrots and sweet potatoes also gave evidence of a sweet tooth in the kitchen. Italian sushi is best forgotten. This jarring cross-cultural mistake, consisting of a warm roll enclosed in a rubbery ring of calamari, won no converts at our table.</p>
        <p>Not too many entrees were unqualified successes. Dishes I'd order again are rigatoni covered with slices of house-made veal sausage, spinach, garlic and truffle oil; a crispy skin roasted chicken over garlic risotto; and shrimp Gabriella, five big shrimps surrounding a centerpiece of couscous. The pan-seared duck tasted fine, but was more well done than requested. The rack of lamb was medium rare as ordered, but an interesting-sounding ''wild forest berry crust'' was undetectable. Skip the spaghetti in plum tomato sauce. The menu also mentions prosciutto and shallots in the mix, but ours was just a dull tomato sauce.</p>
        <p>Smiles returned at dessert time.  The homemade apple cobbler with its cake-like crust was a warm delight. Another night this winning sweet included apples, pears and raspberries. Desserts made elsewhere but still worth the calories include a creamy raspberry cheesecake and a trio of mousse creations (raspberry, chocolate and caramel), each presented on a thin circle of chocolate cake.</p>
