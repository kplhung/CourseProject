        <p>Mallory McCreary, a Brooklyn resident, faced that challenge in 1995 when she tried to book a three-day getaway to the Hamptons.

        <p>Shake Off the City  www.shakeoffthecity.com  Weekend Escapes</p>
        <p>Planning a weekend trip can be as tricky as securing a green patch of Central Park on a balmy Saturday.</p>
        <p>Mallory McCreary, a Brooklyn resident, faced that challenge in 1995 when she tried to book a three-day getaway to the Hamptons. She found scant information on the Internet, and the places she did uncover were either overbooked or overpriced. Even worse were travel directories that peddled advertisements as independent reviews.</p>
        <p>''You had to read between the lines,'' said Ms. McCreary, a freelance marketing consultant and writer. ''It was really difficult to find reliable information on places to stay.''</p>
        <p>But she saw a dot-com opportunity. She started Shakeoffthecity.com, a site that describes itself as ''the perfect tool for frazzled New Yorkers to plan the perfect getaway.''</p>
        <p>The site, begun last summer, includes travel information on 11 regions within a few hours from the city, like the Hamptons, the Catskills, the Hudson Valley, the Jersey Shore, the Berkshires and the Poconos. Listings were culled from published directories, tourist offices and Ms. McCreary's personal travels.</p>
        <p>All reviews are impartial, although some lodges paid to have a photograph and their Internet address displayed, Ms. McCreary said. Active New Yorkers can also search by outdoor diversions such as hiking, fishing, biking, hot air ballooning, canoeing and sun tanning.</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU SEE: A scenic postcard beckons harried New Yorkers to ''Explore next door'' and invites visitors to find nearby lodges and activities. ''Search for lodging'' allows for precise searches, like finding a condominium on the beach. ''Search of activities'' offers a broad range of distractions, like fishing in Montauk or antiquing in Saratoga Springs. Clicking on ''Romantic Getaways'' takes lovebirds to suggestions for fueling their passions. Selecting any of the 11 highlighted regions at the left side of the screen brings up a brief description and sample itinerary. (The North Fork is described as ''the best-kept secret of Long Island.'') Certain words, like specific towns and activities, are hyperlinked. Following them brings up a resource page with addresses and phone numbers.</p>
        <p>A navigation bar at the bottom of each page includes ''Tips'' for travel planning, ''Your $0.02'' for user feedback, and ''Stay in town'' for residents stuck in the city. A message board, found under ''Gab,'' allows visitors to exchange ideas about traveling without a car, summer shares and other leisure concerns.</p>
        <p>LINKS: To hundreds of nearby lodges, camps and outdoor places for sports, adventure or undisturbed loafing. Also includes links to the Empire State B&amp;B Association and other tourist groups, as well as travel directories like Coolworks, a site for finding jobs at vacation spots.</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU GET: An online travel resource for planning a quick escape from the city.</p>
