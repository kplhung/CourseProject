        <p>The installation of 124 cheerful portraits in an otherwise gloomy subway station on Memorial Day won praise from just about everybody who viewed them, except New York Transit.</p>
        <p>To the dismay of patrons of the 181st Street A train station, the drawings of people, animals and anthropomorphized fruit that Margery Cohen, a local artist, had posted in empty advertising spaces along the platform were removed after just three days.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cohen had been denied permission to put the portraits up, so she was not shocked when an M.T.A. representative called her at home and asked her to remove them. The surprise came when she entered the station a few hours later on her way to teach an art class to 6-year-olds. She noticed workers from Transportation Displays Inc. (TDI), which manages advertising in the subway, ripping down her work, to jeers from the public.</p>
        <p>''We deal with the Transit Authority closely, and they tell us what to do and what not to do,'' said Carmine Adisano, transit operations manager for TDI. He acknowledged that there were no immediate plans to use the spaces for advertising, but said the station manager had complained  about the artwork.</p>
        <p>''We can't just allow people to arbitrarily put up their art without authorization,'' said Deirdre Parker, an M.T.A. spokeswoman. ''It's no reflection on her as an artist.''</p>
        <p>Local residents who had admired the work were baffled and saddened by its removal. By the next day, an anonymous rider had posted a sign urging fellow straphangers to complain to the Transit Authority.</p>
        <p>''It's a shame,'' said Greg Sioris, a copyright lawyer and lifelong neighborhood resident. ''It's too bad for the people that put them up. When you've got space that's not being utilized, there's really nothing harmful about having artists use it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cohen is focusing on the success of the project.</p>
        <p>''Even with the short period of time it was up,'' she said, ''far more people saw it than would have in a gallery.''</p>
