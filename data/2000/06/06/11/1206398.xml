        <p>BEING a teenager is tough enough under the best of circumstances. For students who have faced physical and emotional disabilities or extreme poverty, simply getting to school is often an accomplishment.</p>
        <p>The Student Advocacy Organization, an Elmsford-based nonprofit group that provides services for about 1,500 students and their families annually, recognized four of these students for their persistence and achievements at their fourth annual Overcoming the Odds Award dinner earlier this spring.

        <p>BEING a teenager is tough enough under the best of circumstances. For students who have faced physical and emotional disabilities or extreme poverty, simply getting to school is often an accomplishment.</p>
        <p>The Student Advocacy Organization, an Elmsford-based nonprofit group that provides services for about 1,500 students and their families annually, recognized four of these students for their persistence and achievements at their fourth annual Overcoming the Odds Award dinner earlier this spring. One of them, Jennifer Rea, a 19-year-old senior at Brewster High School, did not attend the awards program.</p>
        <p>Here are the stories of the other three students:</p>
        <p>For 13-year-old Jody Sorozan, being a seventh grader at the South Orangetown Middle School in Rockland County is one of the experiences that makes her life fulfilling.</p>
        <p>Born with spina bifida, Jody has already had 17 operations and has several more to go. She attends school dances in her wheelchair, recently joined the Girl Scouts (her mother goes on the overnight camping trips with her) and enjoys having her friends hang out at her house on weekends.</p>
        <p>''What I like up here is everything,'' said Jody, an A student and aspiring teacher, who admits to struggling with math. ''The kids have been nice, and it's very easy to get around. I believe in keeping a positive attitude.''</p>
        <p>Like many other teenagers, Ailena Hill, a senior at Roosevelt High School in Yonkers, has to balance her school work with after school jobs. Unlike most other students, however, she works to support herself: paying rent, buying her own food, clothing and school supplies and trying to save money for college.</p>
        <p>Raised in foster homes from the age of 6 because of her mother's substance abuse problems, Ms. Hill returned to her mother at various times during her childhood. When she was 16, Ms. Hill and her mother lived in a homeless shelter before finding an apartment. As a senior, Ms. Hill moved into her own apartment, which she currently shares with a roommate.</p>
        <p>Her guidance counselor, Robin Klein, said: ''She's so self-motivated and driven to succeed. That's what impressed me most. She has her own desire to have a better life, and she's making it happen.''</p>
        <p>Despite attending six different high schools in the last four years, Ms. Hill is resolute about getting her diploma and moving on.</p>
        <p>''I want to major in business and computers,'' said Ms. Hill, who is waiting to hear from colleges and figure out where she can afford to study. ''I want to have a job where I sit at a desk. I get up at 7, go to school, and work from 1:15 to 10 at night, and then do my homework. I'm tired, and I get depressed when I go to sleep. It's frustrating. Sometimes I just want to be a kid again, but I haven't been a kid ever.''</p>
        <p>Juan Torres, 19, a senior at Croton High School in Croton-on-Hudson, lived in 13 foster homes from the time he was 10 until 14. He is blind because of complications from being born prematurely. His father died when he was 3 and his childhood was characterized by instability.</p>
        <p>''I was moved every three to six months,'' Mr. Torres said. ''I wasn't trusting a lot of people.''</p>
        <p>Being a student at Croton has provided some security for Mr. Torres, who was also one of a dozen Westchester students to receive a $10,000 four-year college scholarship from the Jandon Foundation. He will be a music student at Nyack College next year and hopes to become a music teacher. He plays keyboard, congas and drums and is a vocalist.</p>
        <p>At Croton High, Mr. Torres takes part in wrestling, jazz band and chorus, and he recently went on an exchange trip to Spain.</p>
        <p>He has also gotten started on new part of his life. With three friends, he formed a gospel band, which has produced its own CD and become well enough known in the New York metropolitan region to line up several concerts this summer.</p>
        <p>''The biggest challenge for me is being able to move on,'' he said.</p>
