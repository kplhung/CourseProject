        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The May 14 article about the Somers pool referendum paints the erroneous impression that parents of young children are unified in support of the proposed five-pool complex adjacent to one of the town's most historic sites.</p>
        <p>Over nine years ago, we moved to Somers from over-developed Long Island. Like many parents of young children, we decided to raise our family in Somers because of its open spaces, semi-rural landscape and pre-Revolutionary War heritage. We believe it is vitally important to preserve the scenic landscape and historic heritage of Somers.</p>

        <p>The May 14 article about the Somers pool referendum paints the erroneous impression that parents of young children are unified in support of the proposed five-pool complex adjacent to one of the town's most historic sites.</p>
        <p>Over nine years ago, we moved to Somers from over-developed Long Island. Like many parents of young children, we decided to raise our family in Somers because of its open spaces, semi-rural landscape and pre-Revolutionary War heritage. We believe it is vitally important to preserve the scenic landscape and historic heritage of Somers.</p>
        <p>Recently, much has been made of the fact that Somers is one of a few towns in Westchester without a town pool. However, in many ways, the character and quality of life in Somers is defined by what the town does not have. For instance, Somers does not have garish strip malls, fast-food franchises or the ills that are attendant to suburban sprawl, such as excessive traffic, noise and congestion.</p>
        <p>We share the concerns of other parents regarding the recreational opportunities for our children. In this regard, we would likely support a town pool on a more modest scale at a site that would not be a blight on the landscape.</p>
