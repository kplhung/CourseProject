        <p>New York City's public advocate, Mark Green, responding to a call by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for improved safety procedures on subway platforms, said yesterday that the best safety measure would be more frequent service. More trains, he said, would prevent overcrowding in subway stations.</p>
        <p>At a news conference, Mr. Green released a study of the frequency of service during the morning rush hour, which found that trains on more than half the city's subway lines arrived at intervals of more than six minutes. He said more trains should be put into service, to shorten the time between trains to no more than four minutes, comparable to subway systems in Tokyo, London, Paris and other foreign capitals.</p>

        <p>New York City's public advocate, Mark Green, responding to a call by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for improved safety procedures on subway platforms, said yesterday that the best safety measure would be more frequent service. More trains, he said, would prevent overcrowding in subway stations.</p>
        <p>At a news conference, Mr. Green released a study of the frequency of service during the morning rush hour, which found that trains on more than half the city's subway lines arrived at intervals of more than six minutes. He said more trains should be put into service, to shorten the time between trains to no more than four minutes, comparable to subway systems in Tokyo, London, Paris and other foreign capitals.</p>
        <p>''When subway platforms are so overcrowded that riders are at risk of falling onto the tracks,'' Mr. Green said, ''it's time for increased and more reliable service.''</p>
        <p>The comments by Mr. Green, a frequent adversary of Mr. Giuliani who has announced his intention to run for mayor in 2001, came five days after Mr. Giuliani said he had ordered the police to study ways to reduce the risk of accidents in which people fall onto the tracks and of incidents in which people are deliberately pushed.</p>
        <p>Police records show that there have been nine platform pushing incidents this year, the same number as for all of 1999. The statistics for accidental pushings have not yet been compiled.</p>
        <p>But increased service can be brought about only by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its subsidiary that runs the subway system, New York City Transit.</p>
        <p>Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the M.T.A., said yesterday that the agency would review Mr. Green's suggestions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green released copies of a letter yesterday that he sent on May 19 to Lawrence G. Reuter, president of New York City Transit, more than two weeks before the mayor announced his police study. The letter recommended a fresh investment in new subway trains, saying that service had fallen far short of keeping pace with increased ridership over the last three years, an increase due largely to the city's robust economy and surging tourism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green said yesterday that Mr. Reuter had not responded. Mr. Kelly, the M.T.A. spokesman, declined to comment on the letter.</p>
        <p>At his news conference, Mr. Green ranked subway lines on the basis of their rush-hour frequency. He said the study found the least frequent service on the B, C and M lines, with trains arriving at intervals of more than 8 minutes, and on the G line, where trains arrived at 10-minute intervals.</p>
        <p>The transit agency's biggest hurdle in relieving overcrowding, he said, was on the Lexington Avenue line, where riders have complained for decades about crowding despite short waits between trains.</p>
        <p>The M.T.A. says no more trains can be squeezed into the rush-hour schedule on that line. Mr. Green said the only solution on that line was to build a Second Avenue subway.</p>
