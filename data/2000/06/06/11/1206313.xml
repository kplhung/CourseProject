        <p>It's all about the hand, the current love affair with gadgets. It may seem, at first glance, that it has to do with brushed aluminum, the alluring surface du jour.

No, these qualities may fuel the new economy, but they're not responsible for that peculiar, lustful yearning one feels for the latest cell phone or personal digital assistant, or P.D.A., an abbreviation previously reserved for ''public display of affection.''</p>

        <p>It's all about the hand, the current love affair with gadgets. It may seem, at first glance, that it has to do with brushed aluminum, the alluring surface du jour. Or perhaps speed or power. But you can't actually feel the wind in your hair when a processor is ''blazingly fast.'' No, these qualities may fuel the new economy, but they're not responsible for that peculiar, lustful yearning one feels for the latest cell phone or personal digital assistant, or P.D.A., an abbreviation previously reserved for ''public display of affection.''</p>
        <p>Here's my theory: we love these gadgets so much right now because the evolutionary downsizing of computer technology has reached the point where powerful computers can fit in the human hand.</p>
        <p>For many years, technology of all sorts -- electronic and otherwise -- was big and frightening. Soon enough it will be too small to see, and therefore scary in another way. But right now, this minute, in a store near you, there is some elegant little package with buttons and an antenna (usually) that will sit perfectly in your palm. Not too big. Not too small. Just right.</p>
        <p>In the history of computing, this is the Goldilocks moment. And like Goldilocks, we just can't resist.</p>
        <p>It's an evolutionary intersection, really. Touch is an old sense, more primitive than sight and hearing, and we connect to the world with our hands as much as we do with our eyes or ears. So just as some things look or sound right, the sense that something feels right can be a powerful, if not altogether rational, persuader.</p>
        <p>From the time human beings started chipping rocks, we have made new implements with our hands and used them with our hands. Indeed, for many thousands of years all tools were hand tools. Then came the Industrial Revolution, which brought us technology only a Socialist Realist painter could love. Big technology ruled.</p>
        <p>It was not, as they say, user friendly. Consider Three Mile Island, monster trucks, the bomb, strip-mining machines, mainframe computers. Even now, we associate big computers with huge databases of information on our debts and sexual habits, with the issuing of bills for objects we never purchased and telephone calls we never made, with H.M.O.'s and the I.R.S.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's, I had a summer job in a government office. I worked in the data-processing department, which, of course, processed data. Not on neat little floppy disks, or on big, hidden hard drives, but on punch cards and spools of magnetic tape. The computers were taller than I was, and stood in rows with their tape drives in a cool, dry room with glass walls.</p>
        <p>I didn't work in that room. I worked in the stockroom with another kid my age, tending a machine called a burster. My memory is hazy, but I think it punched perforations in sheets of cards used by trucking companies at highway toll plazas. All I'm certain of is that we would feed sheets of something into it and it chomped them pretty hard.</p>
        <p>One day a new kid came to work in the stockroom, and within his first few days on the job, he got his hand caught in the burster. The machine made the same shuddering sound it did when too many punch cards jammed it, though we could all see it wasn't punch cards that had gummed up the works. As for him, he was too stoic to scream. The process of getting his hand out was the same as getting crumpled cards unstuck, except for the blood. He didn't lose any fingers, or so we heard after his trip to the hospital, but for the rest of the summer, he didn't come back to the stockroom.</p>
        <p>What's the point of this story? Well, do you know anyone who was injured by a personal digital assistant?</p>
        <p>The comparison may seem silly, but I'm convinced that in our primitive consciousness, the part of the brain that regulates sex and shopping, the difference between the sort of technology that can mangle your hands and the sort you hold in your hand is highly significant.</p>
        <p>You look at a technological object and it speaks to you. It says, ''Hands off, buddy!'' Or it says, ''Touch me, hold me, push my buttons. . . . '' (You can finish the sentence with the endearment of your choice.)</p>
        <p>Most of us give in. But once we buy that perfect little P.D.A., or phone, or combination Global Positioning System/digital camera/blood-pressure monitor, we find there's some sleight of hand going on. The gadgets invariably feel great. They look right. Holding them in our hands produces the pleasant belief that we control them. But we don't.</p>
        <p>They control us. And instead of helping us organize our weeks or keep track of our children or resolve family confusion, they are ruining our lives, undermining civilized behavior, destroying the fine dining experience.</p>
        <p>The little machines threaten to devour every minute of time we have. They keep coming out in newer versions, with more features we don't need. And being able to identify this pattern is by no means enough to protect one from falling into it. I'm now onto my second Palm, though I didn't need the first one, and I wanted to trade my cell phone in as soon as I got it. Phone envy. Everyone else's was so much smaller.</p>
        <p>This situation isn't permanent, which is both good and bad news. The Goldilocks moment is fleeting: as chips and intelligent machines get even smaller, they will get to a scale where they become alien again. Perhaps cell phones will be implanted into our skulls with teeny, tiny drills. Medical nanomachines may course through our bloodstreams. Stuff so small we won't be able to think about it will be everywhere, doing who knows what.</p>
        <p>Wired magazine, which is to the new economy what Playboy was to the sexual revolution, recently ran a major essay detailing the dangers of self-reproducing nanomachines and genetic modifications. Technology, the essay said, was getting out of hand, partly because the genes and nanobots could spread and replicate on their own.</p>
        <p>I can feel my skin starting to crawl already. Nasty little invisible bots! They're not like tools, they're technofleas, silicon parasites, with zero consumer appeal. After all, if they're too small to see, they're probably going to be too small to buy. They are not at all handy. And if you ask me, we probably ought to handle them with kid gloves.</p>
