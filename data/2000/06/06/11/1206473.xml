        <p>The legendary James Bond toy car -- the classic boy toy of the mid-1960's -- has been reintroduced by the British manufacturer Hamleys of London. Available as a limited edition in the original Aston Martin model ($59.99, gold-plated collector's edition only) or a white Lotus Esprit model ($49.99; both available at www.Hamleys.com), the cars come with ejector seat, pop-up bullet shield and James Bond figure inside, providing hours of amusement and opportunity to make vroom-vroom noises for fathers and sons alike. And if Dad bursts out crying because he's lost his mini-Bond in the first minutes of playing, never fear: extra replacement figures -- Oddjob, Jaws or 007 himself -- are included.</p>
