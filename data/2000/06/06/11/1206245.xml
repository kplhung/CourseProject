        <p>EUROPE'S REFORMATIONS, 1450-1650</p>
        <p>By James D. Tracy.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 387 pp. Lanham, Md.:</p>
        <p>Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers. $29.95.</p>
        <p>PROTESTANTISM and Roman Catholicism carve up the textbooks. But the difference that really mattered in Reformation Europe was between godliness and worldliness. A life-changing religion of conversion challenged the Christianity of ordinary people, a part-time Christianity that is content to leave some areas of life unaffected. Godly zealots for the reformation of culture took the gospel to the rootless masses of growing towns. They invaded the underevangelized countryside, supplanted local religion with universal cults, blew the bellows among the tepid and policed non-Christian thoughts and tastes. To historians in the future, the Protestants will appear less as a countercurrent than as a spot of turbulence within this great wave.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, for a well-informed, critical, independent-minded but essentially traditional view of the subject, we have a new conspectus by James D. Tracy. He is masterly in absorbing information and masterful in organizing it -- skeptical of fashion, clear in exposition, fluent in communication, unremittingly scholarly. ''Europe's Reformations'' displays in print his efficient, engaging classroom manner. The fact that I disagree with much of it does not make me admire it less or recommend it less warmly.</p>
        <p>Tracy writes for readers who need to be told that Apollo is ''one of the ancient gods'' and Mary is the mother of Jesus. He sacrifices space to basics. He feels obliged to include accounts of episodes of supposedly religious warfare, even though the battles and massacres tell us nothing about religion except the feebleness of its moral impact. England gets a whole chapter, whereas there is virtually nothing about critical arenas like Poland and religious missions sent beyond Europe. High politics absorb nearly half the book. In consequence, Tracy has no time for matters as important as art and music, mysticism, curriculums, sacramentals and the transformation of Europe's old sacred landscapes of shrines and remembered miracles. He even has relatively little time for what he really wants to say.</p>
        <p>This is a pity because his message is important and some of it is right. He shows that the Reformations were essentially similar to movements that preceded them in the Middle Ages and continued into modern times, though he is still too inclined, I think, to claim innovations. He takes it for granted that the Catholic and Protestant Reformations can be treated together, though in practice he gives little space to Catholicism. He rightly, and unfashionably, insists that the Catholic movement was both a Catholic reformation and a counterreformation, though he exaggerates the extent to which it was shaped by reaction. He points out that the growth and social diffusion of confessional ''identities'' were necessarily slow-maturing processes, but gives little attention to the problem of how and when they happened. He brilliantly summarizes research on urban reformations but leaves out the role of factionalism. He argues that Catholicism after the Council of Trent perpetuated a medieval ''pluralism of religious perspectives,'' but does not exemplify this challenging thesis. He identifies reform of society as the evangelicals' aim but does not follow this up. Sex, for instance, was never something divines recommended; but now they were united in thinking it did least harm when licensed by themselves as part of an attempt to monopolize social rituals.</p>
        <p>Tracy acknowledges that ''the Catholic and Protestant Reformations had many of the same objectives'' but instead of developing this insight he concentrates on the differences. He points out that the Reformations have analogues in Orthodox, Confucian, Jewish and Islamic tradition, but he misses the chance to draw the most interesting parallels, which place Western European events in a worldwide context of movements for the recovery of ancient texts and ''pure'' traditions in the early modern period.</p>
        <p>Not all his judgments are sound. He sticks to the view that the Reformation was an expression of anticlericalism, in defiance of most of the work done on this subject since 1925. This may be a result of a rare slip: Tracy believes, contrary to fact, that there was almost no anticlericalism in Castile. He suggests that religion was not ''a familiar motive for war'' in 16th-century Europe and that Calvinism became ''the majority religion'' in the 17th-century Netherlands. He interprets court statistics as evidence that reformed Genevans became ''less quarrelsome . . . and more honest,'' whereas they really reflect the diminishing zeal of denouncers. He regards Catholicism as unique in endorsing ''existing social and ethnic distinctions,'' whereas he would have found many more Protestant cases had he looked more widely. He praises Calvinist success in building a Christian community without giving due weight to his own findings: these ''communities'' were often grim theocracies that victimized ''sinners.''</p>
        <p>In general, I think Tracy's decision to make doctrine the focus of the book is a mistake: he is good at explicating it but poor at making it important. There can hardly be an utterance made by a Protestant on a matter of faith in self-awareness as a Protestant that has not been echoed by a Catholic. This applies to the three points of doctrine Tracy regards as defining: the unique authority of Scripture, the priesthood of all believers and salvation by faith. To most people, doctrine means little; and most early modern investigations showed ignorance or indifference, even among people prepared to fight for their faith. This suggests that what mattered to them were aspects Tracy has little time for, such as the experience of worship, the comradeship of congregations, the charisma of leaders and people's responsiveness to rival claims to authority.</p>
        <p>The divisive issues of the Reformation were historical rather than theological. The question could be put thus: Was the church founded by the apostles, or had some disfiguring discontinuity set in? A Protestant might answer that the church was a wayward child or diabolical changeling. Luther denounced the See of Rome as the foundation not of an apostle but of the Devil. Yet even here, the Reformation debates were conducted with a shared aim: the retrieval of ''purity.'' The Roman church's search for apostolic credentials was not initiated in response to Protestant reforms: it was part of a tradition of pursuit of primitive models of church life and doctrine. The goal was to build a future directly on foundations unearthed from the past -- literally unearthed when, in the 16th century, archaeology began to play a part.</p>
