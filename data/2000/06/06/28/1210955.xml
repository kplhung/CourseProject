        <p>The American Civil Liberties Union today accused the State of Michigan of discriminating against minority students by awarding thousands of merit scholarships solely on the basis of standardized state test scores.</p>
        <p>In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Detroit, A.C.L.U. lawyers asked that the state be prevented from using scores from the Michigan Educational Assessment Program to award onetime scholarships of up to $2,500 to college-bound high school seniors.

        <p>The American Civil Liberties Union today accused the State of Michigan of discriminating against minority students by awarding thousands of merit scholarships solely on the basis of standardized state test scores.</p>
        <p>In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Detroit, A.C.L.U. lawyers asked that the state be prevented from using scores from the Michigan Educational Assessment Program to award onetime scholarships of up to $2,500 to college-bound high school seniors. The lawsuit said  the practice violated Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</p>
        <p>The group also wants a judge to order the Michigan Merit Award Scholarship Program to re-evaluate students who were denied awards this year and to include other gauges like grade point averages and extracurricular activities in its selection process. The A.C.L.U. filed its suit today on behalf of five high school graduates, all members of minorities, who did not earn passing scores on the reading, writing, science and math exams that make up the voluntary Michigan test.</p>
        <p>The A.C.L.U. maintains that the Michigan test is flawed because students in poor schools rarely receive the same amount of preparation for the tests as students from wealthier districts and private schools.</p>
        <p>''This is not an attack on the MEAP test,'' the executive director of the Michigan A.C.L.U., Kary Moss, said in a news conference. ''What it is an attack on is the misuse of the MEAP. By using the MEAP test alone, the state is essentially punishing students for the schools they attend.''</p>
        <p>The state plans to give more than $100 million this fall to colleges and universities that have accepted the roughly 40,000 Michigan high school students who won scholarships. While states are increasingly tying grade promotion and graduation to student test scores, Michigan is considered the only one to base college tuition scholarships solely on test scores. Experts say most states use a combination of measures in awarding tuition.</p>
        <p>The A.C.L.U.'s lawsuit, which comes at a time of intense national debate over standards in education and the use of test scores, could set a precedent, much like a 1989 case in New York State. In that case, a federal judge forbade officials to use SAT scores to award the prestigious  Regents and Empire scholarships, and the A.C.L.U.'s Women's Rights Project said girls were disproportionately discriminated against.</p>
        <p>''A defeat in Michigan should stop other potential test-score abusers in their tracks,'' said Robert Schaeffer, public education director for the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, a nonprofit advocacy group.</p>
        <p>State officials here insisted that the test scores offered a clear picture of academic achievement.</p>
        <p>''A 2-point grade average is not the same in every school,'' said State Treasurer Mark Murray, whose office administers the program. ''We have a uniform, unbiased assessment instrument that is the same in every school. No student has an advantage or disadvantage.''</p>
        <p>The program is paid for with money from the state's settlement with tobacco manufacturers. Students who attend Michigan colleges are eligible for $2,500 in aid, while those who go out of state receive $1,000.</p>
        <p>To further ensure equal access to a scholarship, Mr. Murray said students who failed the test have two chances to retake it, and can qualify by passing two of the four sections of the MEAP and receiving at least a 24 on the ACT or 1170 on the SAT. The  program was created by the Legislature in 1999.</p>
        <p>Donald Heller, an assistant professor of education at the University of Michigan who spent a year researching the legislation's impact, said such allowances did little to close the gap. Based on his research, Mr. Heller said 1 in 3 white students who took all 4 of the tests in spring of 1999 received a scholarship, whereas only 1 in 14 blacks, and 1 in 5 Hispanics and Indians received awards.</p>
        <p>''Michigan is the only state that uses a test like the MEAP test as the sole criterion for awarding these scholarships,'' he said. ''In all other state measures such as high school rank, grade point average or those in combination with a test like the SAT or ACT are used to determine who is awarded these scholarships.''</p>
        <p>The A.C.L.U. lawsuit was based in part on Mr. Heller's research, which was conducted independently months before the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>''The vast majority of these  awards are likely to go to students who would have attended college anyway,'' Mr. Heller said.</p>
        <p>After maintaining a 3.45 grade point average through high school and graduating sixth in her class at Beecher High School in Flint, Bianca Kelly was certain that she would be selected as a Michigan Merit Scholar. Even after learning she had scored a 19 on the ACT and passed all but one of the MEAP tests -- science -- she thought her record and extracurricular activities would help  snare an award. After all, Howard University had found reason enough to accept her.</p>
        <p>But Michigan's scholarship program did not.</p>
        <p>Bianca is applying for loans and depending on help from her family to  pay tuition, room and board at Howard. ''It's just that I worked so hard and it's like it still wasn't good enough,'' she said.</p>
