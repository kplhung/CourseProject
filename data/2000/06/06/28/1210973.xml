        <p>Columbia University plans to create a private school, for kindergarten through eighth grade, in which half of the roughly 700 seats would be reserved for children of the university's faculty and about 70 places would be reserved for neighborhood children on full scholarship, Columbia officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The plan, unanimously approved at a March 3 meeting of the Columbia board of trustees, has not been publicly announced by the university. But as news of the plan has spread through word of mouth, it has already sparked some unease on the Upper West Side, an area that is struggling to produce good public schools. It has also worried some nearby private schools, which could lose students.</p>
        <p>Columbia says it needs the school to be competitive with other universities and attract the best faculty in the world. Neighborhood residents worry that it will drain some of the most educated, affluent and committed families from public schools.</p>
        <p>Jonathan R. Cole, provost and dean of faculties for Columbia, said yesterday that high housing prices and the negative perception of New York City schools had been an obstacle to recruiting top-notch researchers, faculty members and graduate and post-doctoral students. He said some faculty members had fled to places like the University of Michigan after unhappy experiences with New York's public schools.</p>
        <p>''We feel that we have to provide two things in order for those people to come and remain in New York: affordable housing and excellent schooling,'' Mr. Cole said. ''A lot of people don't even come to Columbia because they feel that the quality of some of the public schools are not the quality that they're seeking for their children. That's unfortunate.''</p>
        <p>The school, tentatively called the Columbia University School, would be housed in a 12-story building to be built by Columbia on land it owns on the southeast corner of 110th Street and Broadway, five blocks from the Columbia campus. A D'Agostino's and several smaller stores -- a dry cleaner, a check-cashing store, a fish market and Mike's Papaya, a hot-dog stand -- now occupy the spot.</p>
        <p>The ground floor of the building, which is expected to open in the fall of 2003, would remain commercial and there would be 30 or 40 apartments for Columbia faculty above the floors occupied by the school. Columbia officials said there would be an effort to attract another supermarket to the location.</p>
        <p>Some public school advocates said they viewed the move as an abdication of responsibility by Columbia, because rather than strengthening the public schools in the West Side and Harlem communities, Columbia would be competing with them.</p>
        <p>They questioned why Columbia, if it wanted to build a school, did not instead form a cooperative venture with the public school system. And they raised a 30-year-old specter: Columbia's proposal to build a gymnasium in Morningside Park, between Columbia's campus and a Harlem neighborhood, that triggered a strike in 1968 by university students who said the project would deprive blacks of recreation space.  The proposal was later abandoned.</p>
        <p>''Columbia is further cutting itself off from the neighborhood it lives in,'' said Clara Hemphill, the author of two guides to New York City's best public schools and a consultant for Advocates for Children, a nonprofit group concerned with school and social welfare issues. ''Columbia, with all its expertise and money, has decided to pour that into faculty children. I think the public school system is really in the balance.''</p>
        <p>There have already been concerns about the size of the project. It has  been scaled down to about 12 floors, or 140 feet, from a previous plan for 20 floors, according to Emily Lloyd, executive vice president for administration at Columbia. The original height of the building, to be designed by the architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle, had drawn strong protest from the neighborhood, where most buildings are now shorter than 12 stories. Before proceeding, Columbia must get some zoning variances, Ms. Lloyd said, including one to use a straight facade, like most others on Broadway, rather than an 85-foot setback, and to retain Chase Bank on two floors at one end of the building. Requests for those variances will be heard by the Board of Standards and Appeals, in consultation with Community Board 7, she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cole said the school was modeled on the University of Chicago Laboratory School, started by John Dewey, the pioneering progressive educator, more than 100 years ago. The Chicago school is also private, he said, and has been a magnet for university faculty while also serving neighborhood children.</p>
        <p>Children of Columbia faculty and officers would automatically be admitted to the new school. In a May 1 letter to Columbia faculty, Mr. Cole said this would ''eliminate the time, anxiety and uncertainty associated with application to either the best public or independent schools in the city.'' He added that the current volume of private-school applications in New York City ''far exceeds the number of available slots for children.''</p>
        <p>Tuition would be set at the market rate, and students affiliated with Columbia would receive a 50 percent discount, or pay on a sliding scale based on income, officials said. In addition to the children from the neighborhood who would be on full scholarships, another 20 percent of the pupils would be children of parents working at other nonprofit institutions, like museums and foundations. The rest of the students would be admitted from anywhere in the city.</p>
        <p>Within four blocks of the site are three other independent or parochial  schools -- St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's, the Bank Street School and Cathedral School, which also have attracted Columbia faculty.</p>
        <p>Augusta Kappner, president of Bank Street College, on 112th Street and Broadway, said her school did not feel threatened by Columbia. But, she said, Bank Street officials were puzzled by the decision to build an elementary and middle school. Early on, she said, Columbia had been talking about building a high school, which, she said, was much more needed in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>It is a neighborhood where many parents have applied to ''choice'' schools, which, although public, admit students by application. One of those choice schools, which attracted many Columbia parents, was the Manhattan School for Children, around the corner at 109th Street and Broadway. But it will move out of the area in September, to a building at 93rd Street and Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>The other school at 109th Street, P.S. 165, has become a mostly bilingual school, serving the children of Dominican immigrants. The next closest public school that attracts significant numbers of Columbia families is P.S. 75 on West 96th Street, almost a mile away.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cole said that the Columbia school hoped to establish a ''collaborative relationship'' with nearby public schools and that there had been no intention of abandoning the community. He said Columbia planned to be involved in training teachers, and developing programs with the nearby schools.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, he said, Columbia had conceived of its school as a public school, perhaps a charter school, to be created in partnership with the New York City school system. But, he said, negotiations had broken down. He would not provide further details.</p>
        <p>A neighborhood resident familiar with the talks confirmed Mr. Cole's account and said that District 3, the school district serving the Upper West Side and part of Harlem, had offered Columbia at least two locations for its school. Both of the proposed buildings were then occupied by failing schools in poor neighborhoods of central Harlem, beyond easy walking distance from the university.</p>
        <p>One of the sites the district offered to Columbia, P.S. 76, on West 121st Street, is separated from Columbia University by Morningside Park, down a steep cliff with no easy transportation. The other, P.S. 113, on West 113th Street, is more accessible, but was ultimately given to another public school, the Family Academy, which wanted to expand.</p>
        <p>The resident said that negotiations between Columbia and the school district had also broken down over disagreements about how many places in a Columbia-sponsored public school should be reserved for the children of Columbia faculty.</p>
        <p>Patricia Romandetto, the superintendent of District 3, did not return a telephone call seeking comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cole, the Columbia provost, said there had been many factors at work in the decision to create a private rather than a public school. Besides location, he said, university officials were concerned about issues like how much control they would have over the hiring of teachers and a principal at a public or charter school.</p>
