        <p>The House voted this morning to require a growing number of shadowy tax-exempt groups that raise and spend unlimited amounts on political advocacy to disclose their donors and spending, opening the way for the first major change in campaign finance law in two decades.</p>
        <p>In a surprising reversal, lawmakers approved by a vote of 385 to 39 a bill that mirrors an amendment sponsored by Senator John McCain and endorsed by the Senate this month. On substance and the numbers, there is scant difference between the House and Senate versions, and President Clinton supports the legislation. But the Senate must still give the measure final approval, and the question remains whether Senate Republican foes will try to block or postpone action on the measure.</p>
        <p>Just three weeks ago, the House narrowly defeated virtually the same bill after Republican leaders bowed to pressure from party moderates and promised to bring an even broader campaign disclosure bill to the floor by the July 4 recess if they voted against the more narrow legislation.</p>
        <p>But the strategy backfired when organizations on the left and right, like Common Cause and the National Right to Life Committee, strongly objected to provisions in the leadership-backed bill that would have forced them to disclose their contributors and nonpolitical activities.</p>
        <p>Many Republican leaders and their allies conceded that they had overreached and only reluctantly voted for the more targeted measure.</p>
        <p>''It's a C-minus, not an A,'' said Representative Amo Houghton, a New York Republican who wrote the leadership-backed bill. ''We just couldn't get it. It had too many people with too many pieces that they hated.''</p>
        <p>But champions of tightening the nation's campaign finance laws, who criticized the larger bill as unconstitutional and deliberately punitive toward unions, hailed this morning's  outcome as a victory in closing a loophole created by elected officials and interest groups under Section 527 of the tax code.</p>
        <p>''This represents one small triumph of democracy over secrecy,'' said Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who sponsored the measure that the House rejected on June 9. ''Disclosure by secret 527 political organizations is one modest reform we can still enact before this year's election.''</p>
        <p>In this morning's vote, 205 Democrats, 178 Republicans and two independents voted for the measure; 39 Republicans voted against.</p>
        <p>Speaker J. Dennis Hastert supported the bill, but Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, opposed it, saying it violated First Amendment free speech rights.</p>
        <p>''This so-called 'reform' bill is in reality nothing more than a last-ditch effort by the Democrats to protect their vulnerable incumbent members from valid attacks on their positions and beliefs,'' Mr. DeLay said in a statement.</p>
        <p>If enacted, the campaign disclosure measure would be the first change to campaign finance law since technical changes were made in 1979 to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974, which was passed after the Watergate scandal.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain's measure was adopted, 57 to 42, as an amendment to a military budget bill. But the measure immediately faced a constitutional challenge because experts said the amendment amounted to a revenue measure because it involved possible changes in the tax status of political groups. Under the Constitution, all revenue bills must originate in the House.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the measure say the question now is whether the Senate Republican leadership, specifically Trent Lott, the majority leader, will try to stall or block Mr. McCain's measure. The Senate Finance Committee is to hold hearings on 527 groups on July 12.</p>
        <p>''We have the momentum, we have the policy, we have the votes,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a group that supports overhauling campaign finance law.</p>
        <p>Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, expressed optimism that the House and Senate votes on campaign disclosure could enhance prospects for a ban that he and Mr. McCain support on unrestricted donations, called soft money. But many political analysts say that clamping down on 527 groups does not translate into support for limits on soft money.</p>
        <p>Scores of the new tax-exempt groups have cropped up in recent years, exploited by nonprofit political organizations seeking to avoid the donor disclosure rules and the contribution limits of federal election law.</p>
        <p>These secretive groups are affiliated with causes across the political spectrum, from the Sierra Club to groups with close ties to Representative DeLay of Texas. They are allowed to raise money, buy television and radio advertisements, conduct polling and other political activities, without disclosure, so long as they do not expressly advocate voting for a candidate.</p>
        <p>The measure requires the 527 political organizations to follow federal campaign law and file tax returns.  They would have to disclose any contributors who give more than $200, and report any expenditures more than $500. Violators would have to pay a 35 percent tax on all contributions and expenditures.</p>
        <p>House Republican aides said the measure would take effect upon enactment, meaning it would cover at least part of this election cycle.</p>
        <p>''I'm pleased the House today voted to close the 527 loophole in the tax code that allows money from any source to be spent in American political campaigns without being disclosed to public scrutiny,'' Mr. McCain said in a statement. ''I am very proud of the members of the House who rejected partisan appeals to support a sham reform.''</p>
        <p>This morning's vote capped several days of contentious meetings between House Republican leaders, Republican moderates and Mr. McCain to reach a compromise.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders had sought to win approval for a bill that passed the House Ways and Means Committee last week on a party-line vote.  Under that bill, organizations that spend more than $10,000 on political activities would have to disclose contributions of $1,000 or more. Currently, there is no such requirement. The legislation covered all Section 527 organizations.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeLay and other opponents of revamping campaign finance law have argued for years that what is needed is more disclosure, not more limits on fund-raising. But Democrats and many moderate Republicans complained that the leadership's bill would apply to all sorts of activities, not just those in election campaigns.</p>
        <p>With bipartisan opposition growing to the broader bill, Republican leaders conceded defeat and agreed to bring up the measure dealing only with 527 groups. But they moved the bill to the floor under procedures designed to speed along uncontentious bills, like renaming post offices.</p>
        <p>The process, called the suspension calendar, allows for only 40 minutes of debate, no amendments and requires two-thirds vote for approval, rather than a simple majority.</p>
        <p>Even so, some House conservatives threatened to vote against a top priority of their leaders -- a separate bill to expand Medicare to provide coverage for prescription drugs -- if Republican leaders allowed the 527 bill to come to the floor at all.</p>
        <p>The Republicans voting agains the measure this morning were: Representatives Bob Barr, Joe L. Barton, Herbert H. Bateman, Henry Bonilla, Dan Burton, Charles T. Canady, Helen Chenoweth-Hage, Tom Coburn, Larry Combest, John Cooksey, Philip M. Crane, Tom DeLay, Jay Dickey, John T. Doolittle, J. D. Hayworth, Joel Hefley, Wally Herger, John Hostettler, Bill Jenkins and Sam Johnson.</p>
        <p>Also, Representatives Jack Kingston, Jerry Lewis, John Linder, Donald Manzullo, John L. Mica, Sue Myrick, Michael G. Oxley, Ron Paul, John E. Peterson, Joseph R. Pitts, Richard W. Pombo, George P. Radanovich, Jim Ryun, Mark Souder, Bob Stump, Bill Thomas, Tom Tancredo, William M. Thornberry and  Todd Tiahrt.</p>
