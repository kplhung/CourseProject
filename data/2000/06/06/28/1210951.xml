        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno said today at a Senate hearing that no one ever pressured her into deciding to refuse to seek an outside prosecutor to investigate President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore for their political fund-raising activities during the 1996 campaign.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno, who has repeatedly rebuffed requests for outside inquiries of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, testified that she had made judgments on the basis of the facts and her interpretation of the independent counsel law.</p>
        <p>''I have not been shy about appointing independent counsels when the facts and the law required it,'' she told the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>
        <p>Republicans sought to probe beneath the surface of Ms. Reno's decision-making, but she blunted their efforts, frequently reading aloud Justice Department documents, made public long ago, in which she had explained her thinking.</p>
        <p>For their part, Democrats rallied around Ms. Reno. In an exchange with Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, the attorney general said she had never asked any Justice Department official to reach a particular outcome when interpreting whether to send a case to an independent counsel.</p>
        <p>''Did you ask him to come out a certain way, though, in determining which way -- whether to prosecute or not to prosecute on those campaign finance cases?'' Mr. Leahy asked, referring to Lee J. Radek, head of a unit that advised Ms. Reno on such matters.</p>
        <p>''Never,'' Ms. Reno replied.</p>
        <p>''Did the president of the United States ever pressure you to come out a particular way on any particular matter?'' the senator asked.</p>
        <p>''No, sir,'' Ms. Reno said.</p>
        <p>''Did the vice president of the United States ever pressure you to come out a particular way on a particular matter?'' the senator then asked.</p>
        <p>''No, sir,'' she replied.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno testified five days after Justice Department officials confirmed that Robert J. Conrad Jr.,  head of the agency's campaign finance unit, had urged her to appoint a special counsel to investigate Mr. Gore's fund-raising in 1996.</p>
        <p>Today, Gore aides criticized a Republican on the committee, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who has been leading hearings into how the Justice Department handled campaign finance issues and who was the first lawmaker to publicly disclose Mr. Conrad's recommendation.</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the  Gore campaign, accused Mr. Specter of ''McCarthyite tactics.'' Mr. Lehane said that Mr. Specter and other Republicans ''have turned the Congress into a scandal industrial complex designed to manufacture and create partisan scandals and inflict political damage on the vice president a mere four months before voters go to the polls.''</p>
        <p>At the hearing, Mr. Specter said he had announced Mr. Conrad's recommendation for purposes of ''public accountability'' only after Mr. Conrad had refused to respond when Mr. Specter asked him in an earlier hearing whether the prosecutor had sought a special counsel for Mr. Clinton or Mr. Gore. ''That disclosure was made in the course of the committee's business,'' Mr. Specter said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno is weighing the proposal and has asked Mr. Conrad to respond in writing to questions she has raised about it, government officials said today. Mr. Conrad is expected to meet in a few days with Ms. Reno, who, the officials said, seems unlikely to opt for an outside prosecutor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno has twice refused to seek an independent counsel to investigate Mr. Gore's political fund-raising. Although the law governing such appointments has lapsed, Ms. Reno still has the authority to name special counsels under rules that grant these prosecutors much the same powers as an independent counsel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad's recommendation to appoint a special counsel was based largely on Mr. Gore's sometimes combative answers during an April 18 interview with prosecutors in which Mr. Gore was asked about a number of events, among them his appearance at a Buddhist temple in California, White House coffees for campaign supporters and missing e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>Today, Republicans sought to persuade Ms. Reno to discuss her deliberations on Mr. Conrad's recommendation, but she would not comment on what she said was a pending case. She said, ''If the circumstances justify the appointment of a special counsel, I'll be the first to make it.''</p>
