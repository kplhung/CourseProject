        <p>Columbus sailed west to discover Ella Fitzgerald. The new design for Columbus Center, the 55-story, 2.77-million-square-foot edifice that will take the place of the New York Coliseum, must be seen in light of this previously unreported fact.</p>
        <p>The sounds of Count Basie, Tony Bennett, Miles Davis and Antonio Carlos Jobim are among the richest treasures to turn up in the New World. Columbus Center is a monument to their art form. Though the home of Jazz at Lincoln Center will occupy only a small portion of this massive development, there is music throughout the design.</p>
        <p>Designed by David M. Childs of the New York office of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, Columbus Center will occupy a site that stretches west toward Ninth Avenue, between West 58th and West 60th Streets. In addition to Jazz at Lincoln Center, the building will house the headquarters for AOL-Time Warner. Its two glass towers will include apartments and an eight-story hotel. A retail galleria will occupy the curving base.</p>
        <p>The new design departs substantially from any that have previously been made public, including several prepared by Mr. Childs. His earlier versions were highly derivative designs, plainly modeled after the Century and the Majestic, the great twin-towered apartment buildings designed by Irwin S. Chanin for Central Park West in the late 1920's.</p>
        <p>The new design, by contrast, is an asymmetrical composition of crystalline contour. Sleek abstract geometry has replaced excessively detailed Art Deco motifs. Masonry walls have dematerialized into glass. Instead of mimicking Chanin at three times the scale, the design taps into what was essential in his work.</p>
        <p>The vast bulk of the structure builds on the abstract classicism inherent in the Art Deco style. At the base and the top, unfortunately, the design withdraws into nervous period mannerisms. The result will remind some viewers of a Lincoln Town Car: sleek styling between retro extremities. This is architecture at the amber light. It proceeds with caution. But it does proceed.</p>
        <p>The irregular massing of Columbus Center expresses the mix of uses inside. Six tenants with varied identities will be stacked within what is essentially a vertical city. The bottom four stories of the seven-story base will house a shopping mall with -- oh, groan -- a four-story atrium.</p>
        <p>The mall will be entered at the center of the base's main facade, a sweeping arc of glass and stone that will dominate Columbus Circle's public face. A quiltlike composition of overlapping grids, the facade resembles the silhouette of a classical arcade. The grids have been designed at different scales to create a transition from the street to the gigantic geometrical forms that soar above. Whether this design passes or fails will depend largely on the choice of stone, yet to be made.</p>
        <p>Jazz at Lincoln Center will occupy a privileged spot on the top three floors in the middle of the base. In effect, it is Columbus Center's keystone. Designed by Rafael Vinoly, this suite of interiors includes performance spaces, rehearsal studios and classrooms. A clublike space, aligned with the axis of Central Park South, will provide a spectacular cityscape backdrop. This is the most important cultural project yet undertaken by the Giuliani administration. Bravo, Rudy!</p>
        <p>The theater does not protrude beyond the facade's surface, and this may prompt criticism that the most public-spirited of the building's tenants deserves a more conspicuous profile. Concern has also been raised over the racial implications of placing the jazz center behind a glass and metal screen rather than allowing this most African-American of arts to erupt into the cityscape. But to my eye, the entire design for Columbus Center is infused with the spirit of jazz.</p>
        <p>Setbacks, rising from 5 to 11 stories above the base, will house AOL-Time Warner, Columbus Center's primary tenant (and Related Companies, the developers of the project). Here the glass skin of the building breaks free from the stone grille at the base, like crystals protruding from rock. Rows of overlapping glass panels create a faceted podium for the setbacks and the sheer towers that rise above them.</p>
        <p>Even the two towers now have swing. This is the major improvement over previous designs. Instead of rectangular shafts, strictly aligned with the street grid, the sides of the towers have been tweaked. Parallelograms, now sheathed in glass instead of cast stone, the towers rise like upended prisms.</p>
        <p>The glass is the pearlescent shade of a friendly ghost. Small fins of glass will project from the otherwise flush skin at intervals of 5 and 10 feet. Depending on the sun, and on one's angle of vision, these will scatter light across the surface, as if a jeweler's hammer had split the building's crystalline formation into a thousand glinting shards.</p>
        <p>The towers enclose a sliver of empty space above the jazz theater. Through this void, the view of sky will widen and contract as a person moves around the building, while the towers themselves will appear to shift in volume. Just as music depends on silence, so this angled, vibrant space will be Columbus Center's most powerful device.</p>
        <p>The parallelogram shape was not driven by aesthetics alone. It allows the towers to convey in three dimensions Broadway's deviation from the orthogonal street grid. This is a far more integral response to context than is ordinarily encountered in so-called contextual buildings.</p>
        <p>It recasts the building as a gateway structure, a hinge between Midtown and the Upper West Side. And it reinforces the identity of the media corridor that now extends up (and around) Broadway between Times Square and the ABC Studios on West 66th Street.</p>
        <p>Illuminated crowns on the top of the towers are the design's most explicit Art Deco reference. The building does not gain from them. Three-story lanterns punctuated with vertical stainless steel blades, they introduce the note of pastiche at precisely the climactic moment when the towers should claim a contemporary place in the skyline.</p>
        <p>Aesthetic backsliding also infects the main base facade. This, too, is a remnant of earlier schemes that tried to give Columbus Circle the classical coherence its City Beautiful designers intended. But Americans prefer liveliness to coherence in public spaces. This is not reflected in the facade's classical arcade. While less ponderous than in previous versions, even less would be more. The halves of the facade might have benefited from a more heterogeneous design.</p>
        <p>This is a transitional building, designed by a firm that has long represented the center of gravity in American architecture. The center is shifting. The superiority of the design to previous versions cannot be accounted for by taste. It rests on the internal logic of the design's aesthetic intention.</p>
        <p>If you intend to honor Chanin's architecture, you must begin by analyzing its fundamental characteristic. Chanin put classical architecture through a process of abstraction. His work adhered to classical laws of symmetry and proportion but deleted explicit symbols of classical style. In this, it differs from, say, the former AT&amp;T tower at 195 Broadway, with its rows of columns and pilasters stacked to the sky.</p>
        <p>Abstraction, for 20th-century artists, was not a purely aesthetic matter. Liberation from explicit historical motifs held social meaning. It conveyed the idea that assimilation into the Western tradition did not require submission to archaic and undemocratic forms of privilege.</p>
        <p>The best way to honor Chanin's precedent is to continue the abstraction process. That means deleting explicit references to Chanin as rigorously as Chanin deleted references to Greece and Rome. If you copy Chanin's period details, as Mr. Childs did in earlier versions, the design ceases to be abstraction and becomes representation. Instead of honoring Chanin, the design contradicts him. It becomes a picture of a 1920's building, rather than a rethinking of his process.</p>
        <p>With its use of glass, reduction in detail and crisp geometric forms, the new version of Columbus Center resumes the abstraction process. This process could have been pushed further. Indeed, last November Mr. Childs prepared such a plan, which was presented to the New York City Planning Commission. After months of wrangling with the city, which nearly caused Mr. Childs to quit the job, his original design was at least partly restored.</p>
        <p>Even in its compromised state, the new design is a compelling recapitulation of S.O.M.'s history. It fuses the International style crispness of the firm's vintage years with the revivalist imagery of more recent work. And it reaches back further, trying to reconcile the differences that divided modernist architects from their Art Deco counterparts in the 30's.</p>
        <p>Like a jazz fugue, the design picks up a tune that has been bouncing around town for the better part of a century. At dusk, when the lights come up on the skyline, indigo will reverberate between the towers. Only in New York could a colossus become a mood piece.</p>
