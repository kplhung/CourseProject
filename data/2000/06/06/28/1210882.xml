        <p>A Place With Taste</p>
        <p>The first Manhattan restaurant designed by Adam Tihany was La Coupole, at 32nd Street and Park Avenue, which failed as an enterprise but not as a handsome design. When La Coupole closed, the space was turned over to An American Place, which moved out last year. Now, Mr. Tihany is about to refurbish the room, paying homage to his original design. In the fall it is to become Artisan, a wine bar with brasserie food and atmosphere and an emphasis on cheese. The owner, Terrence Brennan, who owns Picholine, said Artisan will also have a cheese shop.</p>
        <p>Thalia Addition</p>
        <p>Thalia Kitchen, a small takeout counter on 50th Street just off Eighth Avenue, is a new addition to Thalia, around the corner at 828 Eighth Avenue. It sells breakfast items, soups, sandwiches and salads. Desserts, including lemon mousse with shortbread and fresh berry tarts, are prepared by the restaurant's pastry chef, Verite Mazzola.</p>
        <p>Chefs on the Move</p>
        <p>Brian Young, who had worked at Le Bernardin, is leaving Pop, the hip spot on Fourth Avenue and 13th Street, to become the executive chef of the Citarella restaurant, which is to open this fall at 49th Street and Avenue of the Americas.</p>
        <p>Alex Garcia, the chef at Calle Ocho on the Upper West Side, will also be a partner in Babalou, a Latin restaurant and dance club, with Ralph Mercado, a Latin music producer, and Jose Rosado, who develops nightclubs. They have taken over the Ibis space at 323 West 44th Street and also plan a 300-seat dinner theater and cafe.</p>
        <p>David Adjey, who worked at San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara, Calif., and was once Dan Ackroyd's personal chef, is the new executive chef at the Rihga Royal Hotel.</p>
        <p>Claude-Alain Solliard has left his post as executive chef at Raoul's in SoHo to devote his energies to Seppi's on West 56th Street, where he was also cooking, and to work on a new venture, Kino, in the Dumbo district of Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Frederic Kieffer, who had been at Windows on the World and Southwest NY, is adding Gallic touches to the menu at the Farmhouse in East Hampton, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The Palm West, a steakhouse on West 50th Street, has hired Craig Kennah, a native of Queens, whose credentials include Michelin-starred places in France and Ambrosia in Boston.</p>
