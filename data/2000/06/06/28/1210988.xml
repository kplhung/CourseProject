        <p>Just over a week ago, Rod Thorn and Byron Scott sat in a room in O'Hare Airport in Chicago talking basketball. There were no game films to watch, no statistical profiles to ponder, just Thorn and Scott and a magnetic board between them.</p>
        <p>Thorn, the Nets' president, asked Scott to use the magnetic pieces to demonstrate everything he knew about basketball -- offensive game plans, defensive philosophy and fast-break theories. For six hours, Scott worked the board, astounding Thorn with his knowledge and convincing him that he was the coach the Nets needed.</p>

        <p>Just over a week ago, Rod Thorn and Byron Scott sat in a room in O'Hare Airport in Chicago talking basketball. There were no game films to watch, no statistical profiles to ponder, just Thorn and Scott and a magnetic board between them.</p>
        <p>Thorn, the Nets' president, asked Scott to use the magnetic pieces to demonstrate everything he knew about basketball -- offensive game plans, defensive philosophy and fast-break theories. For six hours, Scott worked the board, astounding Thorn with his knowledge and convincing him that he was the coach the Nets needed.</p>
        <p>''We went over every possible conceivable situation that could happen on the basketball court,'' Thorn said today at the Nets' Champion Center. ''That's when I became sold on Byron. He had all the answers, so I was very impressed with what he knew about the X's and O's part of the game. Not only was he a terrific player, but he also has been doing his homework regarding how the game is played, how the game is taught, how the game is coached. This team needs a terrific coach. This team needs somebody who will nurture our young players and this team needs a firm hand where rules will be set and rules will be followed. That's what Byron Scott brings to the table.''</p>
        <p>Today, Scott, the former Los Angeles Lakers guard who won three championships playing with Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, was announced as the Nets' new head coach. He received a three-year deal for $6.3 million, and the Nets have an option to keep him for a fourth season.</p>
        <p>Scott, who played for the Lakers, Indiana Pacers and Vancouver Grizzlies during his 14-year career, said the day's events were the fulfillment of a dream that began six years ago, when Larry Brown told him that he would make a good head coach.</p>
        <p>''Larry allowed me to come in there and teach the guys, teach them how to win and what winning was all about,'' Scott said of the two years he played under Brown with the Pacers. ''That was the first time I really started thinking about coaching. He was the first person to tell me that I think you'd be a great coach. It's been on my mind ever since.''</p>
        <p>While Scott's strategic knowledge impressed Thorn, his background also served as an advantage. In addition to playing for Brown, he also played seven seasons for Pat Riley with the Lakers, giving him the distinction of having played for two of the league's top coaches. Scott, 39, said he learned a great deal from the two coaches and incorporates much of their style and teachings into his coaching.</p>
        <p>''I'll bring the type of discipline that they bring to a team,'' Scott said. ''I'm very demanding because I've had two very demanding coaches, so I have nothing but that in my blood right now.</p>
        <p>''I'm a positive person. I understand that these guys love to be patted on the back, but they also want that discipline of knowing that they did do or didn't do the right thing.''</p>
        <p>Scott, whose only coaching experience came when he assisted Rick Adelman in Sacramento the past two seasons, compared himself to Doc Rivers, the former player who was coach of the year this season in his first year with Orlando. Scott said he believes that former players have an advantage as coaches because they can better relate to the players.</p>
        <p>''We've been through all the stuff the players are going through, so what you tell them carries a little more weight,'' said Scott, who retired in 1997. ''I understand the players. I understand what it takes to win. I've been to the mountain top. I've achieved unbelievable success as an N.B.A. player so I know what it takes to get to the next level, and I know how to push those buttons.''</p>
        <p>Stephon Marbury, the Nets' star point guard, is already sold.</p>
        <p>''He brings respect from the door, as soon as he walks in,'' Marbury said. ''Having a guy like that, you know his mentality as far as practice. You know what's going to be expected of you. You know you're going to have to come in every day and work, and that's what we need. We need that attitude.''</p>
        <p>Scott said he will attempt to bring the fast-break style of the Lakers to New Jersey. Offensively, that will mean lots of ball movement. He will also encourage Marbury to push the ball in the open court. Defensively, that will mean improved on-the-ball and help coverage and stronger rebounding.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The nine-year career of JAYSON WILLIAMS will officially come to an end on Wednesday when the Nets announce that he can no longer play because of the broken right leg he suffered in a collision with STEPHON MARBURY during a game on April 1, 1999. . . . BYRON SCOTT, who has not chosen his assistant coaches yet, said he will consider all of the current Nets' assistants, EDDIE JORDAN, JIMMY LYNAM and MIKE O'KOREN. Jordan will definitely remain on the staff, and Lynam was the coach of the San Diego Clippers when the team drafted Scott with the fourth pick in the 1983 draft. The Clippers then traded Scott, along with SWEN NATER, to the Lakers for NORM NIXON and Jordan.</p>
