        <p>Throughout the New York City school system, principals and other administrators are increasingly being asked to take a business approach -- rather than an educational one -- to problem solving. From the chancellor's quarters of Harold O. Levy, a former corporate executive, to the principal's office, where administrators are being given more authority over budgeting, a new attitude is being fostered.</p>
        <p>And that is making many school principals uneasy.</p>
        <p>''I keep hearing the chancellor say that instructional leaders are managers, but my education is not one with managerial aspects to it,'' Mary McInerney, principal of the Richard R. Hungerford School, a special education school on Staten Island, said at a recent principal training session that Mr. Levy addressed. ''There is this whole shift to being a manager that I don't know if I'm prepared for. And when I need to ask someone about accounting or writing a press release, there is nobody in the Board of Education to teach me.''</p>
        <p>Helping New York City school principals adjust to that way of thinking is the focus of two training programs sponsored by independent civic groups. One, the Pencil Fellows program, a monthly seminar series in its first year, is an extension of the Principal for a Day program run by the educational group Pencil, which brings 1,100 corporate managers each year into the city's schools to give them a taste of life in the schools.</p>
        <p>Another program, sponsored by the National Executive Service Corps, has been working with New York City principals for five years, similarly aiming to develop partnerships between schools and the managers of local foundations and corporations.</p>
        <p>The Pencil Fellows program matches a principal with a corporate manager for a six-month series of meetings, said Ruth Cohen, Pencil's executive director. At the meetings, the partners work one-on-one, talking about issues facing the school leaders and potential ways to solve them, and in groups, discussing ideas they have tried, some that worked and some that did not.</p>
        <p>Several principals voiced concern about the fact that their job performance is being judged by their students' scores on standardized tests. That score, even if the principals can influence it, does not account for the different homes and environments of students in varying schools.</p>
        <p>But some corporate managers reminded the principals that that is how things work elsewhere. Norma Kamali, the fashion designer, told the group at a recent Pencil Fellows session that the principals' quandary was no different from her own: she is judged every season by her designs, and her success is measured by how well they sell, whether the critics love them or not.</p>
        <p>Gillian Williams, the principal of Public School 63, a South Bronx school that is part of the Chancellor's District for underperforming schools, agreed. Even though many of her students come from disadvantaged backgrounds, ''I want them to be judged the same as the kids in the suburbs,'' she said, ''because ultimately I want them to be competing for spots in college with those kids.''</p>
        <p>But as with any attempt to teach the often esoteric skills of management, tangible results of the programs can be hard to pinpoint. And leaders of the programs admit  that the results are, so far, mixed at best.</p>
        <p>''The assumption is that when you put together a group of intelligent, committed professionals, they will teach each other and trust each other,'' said Gerald D. Levy, president of the Education Group of the National Executive Service Corps, an association of retired executives who do consulting work with nonprofit groups and agencies. ''But even in the best program, that is not something that very often happens.''</p>
        <p>School principals themselves admit that the problems with that approach are many. ''Principals are very competitive, so there is some pressure not to be so honest,'' Vincent Brevetti, principal of the Humanities Prep High School in Manhattan, said in an interview. In fact, he said, when you get a bunch of school principals together to talk about problems at work, the last thing they want to do is to acknowledge they have problems.</p>
        <p>There is also a certain wariness among principals who have become inured to the plodding bureaucracy of the Board of Education and cynical about attempts to inject  life into it.</p>
        <p>During more than one of the Pencil Fellows sessions this year, the moderators worked hard to keep the session from devolving into an exercise in bashing the  Board of Education. But participants in both programs say they have at least begun to learn how to translate each other's experiences and skills into ideas that could improve schools.</p>
        <p>James L. Williams, a vice president at the National Executive Service Corps, explains how in one session in his program, principals expressed frustration that they had to keep training parents who joined parent-teacher organizations.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the group began to rely on the model many corporations use for their boards of directors, Mr. Williams said. ''A principal from another district told how they had staggered the terms, getting parents of younger kids first involved in subcommittees so that once they were experienced, they could move up to bigger positions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Hashing through those issues has not been easy, both the principals and the corporate managers said.</p>
        <p>''I worry about the idea among some principals that 'We were not taught to be managers,' '' said Brad Y. Coleman, an investment banker at Salomon Smith Barney who was matched with a school leader in the Pencil Fellows program. ''I wasn't taught how to be a manager, either, or how to be a psychiatrist to the 100 people who work for me. But it comes with the territory.''</p>
