        <p>SUMMER is here, business travelers! Time to glare at those airport tote boards and boil.</p>
        <p>Summertime flight delays are starting to pile up as traffic increases at domestic airports. And despite new strategies for better-coordinated air traffic control responses to weather-related delays that cause most of the problems in an overtaxed system, the industry is worried that this summer is going to be a lot like last summer, the worst period ever for domestic flight delays.</p>
        <p>''Last summer was an unmitigated disaster,'' said David A. Fuscus, the vice president for communications at the Air Transport Association, the airline industry's main trade group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fuscus didn't want to specifically predict another unmitigated disaster. ''This summer it looks like we'll have the same type of record,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Actually, federal records so far indicate a slight improvement in the situation this year. In April, the airline industry and the Federal Aviation Administration put into place a new program called the Spring/Summer 2000 Severe Weather Plan. Among its provisions, Mr. Fuscus said, is a procedure that gives a ''more robust role'' to the main federal air traffic control center in Virginia. This enables controllers there to do central monitoring and adjusting of traffic in every segment of the domestic system during those times when bad weather in various places starts those airport tote boards blinking.</p>
        <p>In May, flight delays dropped by 7 percent, the F.A.A. said. But the industry isn't exactly breaking out the Champagne over that. ''On the surface, it may sound good, and the F.A.A. may tell you that it's good -- until you consider that we've had a flight-delay crisis over the last three summers, including this summer,'' Mr. Fuscus said. ''If you go back to May of 1997, though, you actually see an increase in delays of 90 percent this May.''</p>
        <p>Anticipating another summer of snarled skies, some airlines are even reducing flight schedules in advance. ''No one is more frustrated by it than the airlines,'' Mr. Fuscus said. ''I mean, United Airlines just canceled 4,500 flights throughout the summer because there is no confidence they wouldn't be delayed.''</p>
        <p>The overall problem is an out-of-date air traffic control system. ''It can't move enough planes through the sky quickly enough under the present safety parameters, which are, of course, correct,'' said Mr. Fuscus, whose organization has been assiduously lobbying Congress to put a lot more money than it has so far into modernizing the aged aviation infrastructure, which the airline industry contends will take another 7 to 10 years to bring fully up to date.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, delays in the summer are here to stay until that air traffic control system is fixed,'' Mr. Fuscus said. ''It gets our customers screaming mad. And they don't get mad at the F.A.A., they get mad at us.''</p>
        <p>But hey, it could be worse. For example, we could be stuck with a system like the one in Europe, where antiquated technology combines with nationalistic chauvinism to create an air traffic network so fragile that some indignant Frenchmen can basically shut it down like dairy farmers railing against European Union cheese quotas.</p>
        <p>I refer to the situation in France this week. French air traffic controllers, incensed at the European Union for discussing the idea of a central, and perhaps partially privately owned, air traffic system for all of Europe, walked off the job for 24 hours on Monday in a wildcat strike. The action grounded 90 percent of the flights within France and caused backups and cancellations throughout the Western European air system. About half of the international flights that pass through French airspace were also canceled, and stranded business travelers in France had to commandeer space on busses and trains to get to neighboring countries like Belgium to try to pick up flights.</p>
        <p>''Our traffic is back to normal today, and we don't see any other problems in the near future,'' a spokeswoman for Air France said yesterday afternoon. British Airways, which canceled 37 flights to and from France on Monday, also said that its operations had returned to normal. But the French protest spread yesterday to Greece, where air traffic controllers, demanding assurance that the Greek system won't be privatized, began a four-day strike during prime flight hours to make their feelings known about control-tower sovereignty.</p>
        <p>Pierre J. Jeanniot, the director general of the International Air Transport Association, predicted a summer of major delays in the European air system. ''The situation is totally unacceptable,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fuscus said: ''If there's an example of something that works worse than our system, it's the European system. We've got a delay crisis; they've got a delay calamity brewing. It's absolutely abysmal. I can't imagine there could be anything worse than our system in the summertime in terms of delays, but there it is: Europe.''</p>
