        <p>Fox and NBC have rejected Major League Baseball's request to triple their rights fees, opening the door for baseball to seek CBS's and ABC's interest.</p>
        <p>Baseball believes it can justify raising Fox's annual rights fee to $345 million and NBC's to $240 million because ESPN is now paying nearly four times what it paid last season under a regular-season contract signed last year.</p>

        <p>Fox and NBC have rejected Major League Baseball's request to triple their rights fees, opening the door for baseball to seek CBS's and ABC's interest.</p>
        <p>Baseball believes it can justify raising Fox's annual rights fee to $345 million and NBC's to $240 million because ESPN is now paying nearly four times what it paid last season under a regular-season contract signed last year.</p>
        <p>ESPN, which has a separate playoff deal with baseball, rejected demands to increase its fee for seven division series games. ESPN has been paying $42 million a year for the games. It is not known how much more money baseball wanted.</p>
        <p>If CBS and ABC voice interest in what NBC and Fox turned down, baseball must offer them a deal at the rejected prices, industry officials said. And if baseball scales back its demands, it must first present them to NBC and Fox.</p>
        <p>Because CBS and ABC don't desperately need or covet baseball, it seems unlikely that either network would meet baseball's demands.</p>
        <p>Fox and NBC, whose contracts expire after this season, are unwilling to pay more because they believe it would guarantee high losses. Modest increases would probably be acceptable because the networks believe their current deals are fairly priced, while ESPN paid more because its previous contract was undervalued.</p>
        <p>If CBS and ABC enter the talks, they would probably prefer NBC's package, which includes one League Championship Series, three division series games and All-Star Games and World Series in alternate years. Most of baseball's value is in the postseason; Fox carries the regular-season Game of the Week Saturdays. Fox also carries one L.C.S., up to six division series games and every other World Series and All-Star Game.</p>
