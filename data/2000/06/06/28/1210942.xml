        <p>For the first time in a decade, inflation-adjusted spending on public school students in New York City has significantly exceeded the peak it reached before the city plunged into recession in the early 1990's, the Board of Education reported yesterday.</p>
        <p>In the school year that ends this week, the board expects to spend at least $10.5 billion, or an average of $9,573 for each of its 1.1 million students. That is an increase of almost 7 percent from the 1998-99 school year, when spending totaled $8,957 per student.</p>

        <p>For the first time in a decade, inflation-adjusted spending on public school students in New York City has significantly exceeded the peak it reached before the city plunged into recession in the early 1990's, the Board of Education reported yesterday.</p>
        <p>In the school year that ends this week, the board expects to spend at least $10.5 billion, or an average of $9,573 for each of its 1.1 million students. That is an increase of almost 7 percent from the 1998-99 school year, when spending totaled $8,957 per student.</p>
        <p>Measured in constant 1990 dollars, this year's spending is expected to total $7,600 per student, the first significant gain over the $7,400 that was spent in the 1989-90 school year and again last year. With the onset of a national recession in 1990-91 -- one whose effects lingered in the New York region longer than in many other areas of the country -- per-pupil spending fell steadily, to a low of $6,600 per student in the 1997-98 school year, before beginning to rebound.</p>
        <p>The Board of Education was also able to direct a higher percentage of its total outlays into the classroom this year than in each of the three previous years, thanks in large part to the long boom on Wall Street. Meanwhile, fewer dollars were directed to programs like building maintenance and school safety.</p>
        <p>The budget figures released yesterday were part of the board's annual School-Based Budget Reports, which are preliminary estimates of year-end figures based on spending through May 17.</p>
        <p>Final reports on the year's actual expenditures, which are expected to be closer to $10.8 billion, will be released in January.</p>
        <p>Because gains in the city's financial investments this year reduced its required contribution to pension plans for retired board employees, proportionately more dollars were scheduled this year for classroom instruction, one of seven major categories of spending tracked by the board.</p>
        <p>Spending on classroom instruction, which includes expenses for teacher salaries, books and supplies and teacher training, is expected to total 54.5 percent of outlays this year. That is the highest since the Board of Education began releasing detailed budget breakdowns in the 1996-97 school year. Last year, classroom spending accounted for 52.7 percent of total expenses.</p>
        <p>Much of the new money is paying for teacher training programs and instructional supplies, according to the budget reports.</p>
        <p>Professional development and other contracted instructional services rose to 2.9 percent of total spending this year from 1.9 percent last year, while instructional supplies and equipment -- which covers everything from software to furniture -- rose to 2.2 percent of spending from 1.1 percent.</p>
        <p>Several categories of spending are expected to decline this year, both in total dollars and percentage of total outlays, including building maintenance and school safety.</p>
        <p>Projected spending on school safety officers and supplies declined to $102.8 million, or 1 percent of the budget, from $117 million, or 1.2 percent of total spending last year.</p>
        <p>Beverly Donohue, the board's chief financial officer, said that  spending would jump significantly next year with the addition of 500 safety officers recently approved by the Giuliani administration.</p>
        <p>Building maintenance, which includes salaries and supplies for maintenance but not for the separate custodial services, is expected to account for $180 million, or 1.7 percent of the total budget. Last year, spending on building maintenance totaled $187 million, or 1.9 percent of outlays.</p>
