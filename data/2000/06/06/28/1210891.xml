        <p>''It's always like this,'' said Marilyn Soto, an editor at Young &amp; Rubicam, who was in a line of more than 20 people inching their way to the counter of Rainbow Cafe Falafel, 26 East 17th Street.

The owner, Mohammad Jamal, confirmed that it had been like that since the day he opened -- with a line -- about six years ago.</p>
        <p>So is it just the food? No. As Ms. Soto put it, ''The people are incredibly friendly and nice.''

        <p>The falafel sandwich is about as good as a falafel sandwich can be. A whole-wheat pita is filled first with a salad of shredded lettuce, onion and carrots. Then, ovals of crisp, spicy, freshly fried falafel are tucked inside, followed by diced tomato and a generous drizzle of tahini dressing. It costs $3. No wonder there's a line.</p>
