        <p>I SPENT the first 18 years of my life in Baltimore, and not once did I eat pit beef. I am not particularly proud of this fact, but it does reflect the parochialism of the region's food. I grew up in the suburb of Pikesville, Md., and the foods of my childhood embraced the four C's of Baltimore gastronomy: crab, corned beef, coddies (leaden cakes of codfish and potatoes) and chocolate tops (cookies crowned with a rosette of chocolate icing).</p>
        <p>Pit beef came from a working-class neighborhood on the east side of town, which for me might as well have been another planet.</p>
        <p>Pit beef is Baltimore's version of barbecue: beef grilled crusty on the outside, rare and juicy inside and heaped high on a sandwich. Several things make it distinctive in the realm of American barbecue.</p>
        <p>For starters, pit beef is grilled, not smoked, so it lacks the heavy hickory or mesquite flavor characteristic of Texas- or Kansas City-style barbecue. It is also ideally served rare, which would be unthinkable for a Texas-style brisket. Baltimore pit bosses use top round, not brisket, and to make this flavorful but tough cut of beef tender, they shave it paper-thin on a meat slicer.</p>
        <p>Then there's the bread: the proper way to serve pit beef is on a kaiser roll or, more distinctively, on rye bread. The caraway seeds in the rye reflect the Eastern European ancestry of many Baltimoreans in this part of town and add an aromatic, earthy flavor to the beef.</p>
        <p>Finally, there is the sauce. No ketchup, brown sugar and liquid smoke, as you would find in Kansas City. No Texas-style chili hellfire or piquant vinegar sauces in the style of North Carolina. The proper condiment for Baltimore pit beef is horseradish sauce -- as much as you can bear without crying. And speaking of crying, you need slices of crisp, pungent white onion to make the sandwich complete.</p>
        <p>The center of Baltimore pit beef is an industrial thoroughfare called Pulaski Highway, also known as Route 40. As you drive east out of the city, you pass truck stops, tractor dealerships and inexpensive motels. Nestled among them are the simple roadside eateries that purvey pit beef.</p>
        <p>You could stop at one of the best known, Chaps, a white cinder-block building with picnic table seating. It has been cooking old-fashioned pit beef -- over blazing charcoal -- since 1987. Or you could head for Big Al's, where every pit beef sandwich comes with a nugget of Italian hot sausage.</p>
        <p>For my money, there's no better place to sample pit beef than Big Fat Daddy's in Rosedale, Md., next to a country-Western dance hall named Little Texas. To call Big Fat Daddy's a restaurant would be stretching. The ''dining room'' is a yellow and red tent with plastic siding. The pit (a gas and lava stone grill) is housed in a cinder block building not much bigger than a closet. You place your order at the window and dine at a picnic table, watching the traffic rumble by.</p>
        <p>Big Fat Daddy's takes its name from Brian Schafer, 31, a ruddy barbecue entrepreneur. He is big, all right, tipping the scales at 280 pounds. But he has shed 65 pounds since he opened the eatery in 1996 and worked 100 hours a week, running the restaurant and a catering business. ''I got tired of working for other people,'' he said. ''I thought I could do things a little better.''</p>
        <p>If perfection lies in attention to detail, the details distinguish Big Fat Daddy's from the other pit beef emporiums. Mr. Schafer rubs his beef with a tangy mixture of seasoned salt, pepper, oregano, garlic powder and paprika, and he lets the meat sit in the rub for three days. (Most Baltimore pit beef is grilled without all this.) When he makes a sandwich, he takes the time to slice a few burnt edges (the charred crust) to mix with the rare beef, thus adding smoke, crunch and flavor.</p>
        <p>Most pit beef places serve bottled prepared horseradish, but Mr. Schafer makes his own sauce, a rich, creamy confection of horseradish and mayonnaise.</p>
        <p>Regulars may miss the old days, when Big Fat Daddy's grilled its beef over charcoal. Mr. Schafer switched to gas two years ago, he said, because ''we got tired of looking like we cooked in a coal mine.''</p>
        <p>These touches have brought big success. In the summer, Big Fat Daddy's goes through 40 top rounds (each weighing 25 pounds) a week. That is enough to serve 3,000 to 4,000 sandwiches, at $4 each, every week.</p>
        <p>Baltimore pit beef isn't difficult to prepare at home and makes a nice switch from the usual ribs and brisket for a party. The only real challenge is slicing the beef thin enough. If you have a meat slicer, you will have no problem. If not, a thin-slicing disc on a food processor will do the trick. Cut the roast in pieces small enough to fit into the feed tube. Or, just slice the meat as thin as possible by hand, then chop it with a cleaver.</p>
        <p>The recipe here will give you eight two-fisted sandwiches. The rub is based on the seasoning mix used at Big Fat Daddy's. Lettuce and tomatoes are optional.</p>
        <p>This Baltimore boy never knew what he was missing.</p>
        <p>BALTIMORE PIT BEEF SANDWICH  Adapted from Big Fat Daddy's  Time: 1 hour, plus 3 hours' to 3 days' marinating</p>
        <p>For the rub:  2 tablespoons seasoned salt  1 tablespoon sweet paprika  1 teaspoon garlic powder  1 teaspoon dried oregano</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</p>
        <p>For the sandwich:  1 3-pound piece top round  8 kaiser rolls or 16 slices of rye bread  Horseradish sauce (see recipe)  1 sweet white onion, sliced thin  2 ripe tomatoes, sliced thin (optional)  Iceburg lettuce (optional).</p>
        <p>1. Combine ingredients for the rub in a bowl, and mix. Sprinkle 3 to 4 tablespoons all over the beef, patting it in. Place in a baking dish, and cover with plastic wrap. You can cover the beef with the rub for a few hours, but for maximum flavor, leave it for 3 days in the refrigerator, turning once a day.</p>
        <p>2. Prepare a hot grill. Grill beef 30 to 40 minutes, or until outside is crusty and dark brown and internal temperature is about 120 degrees (for rare). Turn beef often. Transfer to a cutting board; let it rest 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Slice beef thinly across grain. Pile beef high on a roll or bread slathered with horseradish sauce. Garnish with onions, tomatoes and sliced lettuce. Serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 sandwiches.</p>
        <p>HORSERADISH SAUCE  Adapted from Big Fat Daddy's  Time: 3 minutes</p>
        <p>1 cup mayonnaise</p>
        <p>1/2 cup prepared white horseradish, or to taste  2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice  Salt and black pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>Combine ingredients in a bowl, and whisk to mix. Adjust seasonings to taste.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 1/2 cups.</p>
