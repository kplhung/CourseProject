        <p>THE opening of a new Balducci's on the Upper West Side this month certainly struck many in the neighborhood as a marvelous gift from downtown, an outpost of one of the city's finest food shops.</p>
        <p>But to others the West Side store represents a new chapter in what has been a rancorous family fight that has persisted relentlessly for years. In fact, the estrangement is now so complete that at both Balducci's the only thing left of the family is the name. And that was sold to an outside company last year.</p>
        <p>For years the food world has buzzed about the hostility among the three Balducci siblings, two of whom ran the famous Greenwich Village store with their parents and some of their children until 1985, when Grace Balducci Doria and her husband, Joe, left to open Grace's Marketplace on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>It was the beginning of the end of a 54-year-old family business, and of a pioneering speciality food market in New York. Balducci's was the first to sell premium quality foods -- with a top flight butcher shop, fishmonger, deli and greengrocer all under one roof. It was a model for speciality markets all over the city, but especially for those opened by other Balducci family members, as difficult working conditions drove them away.</p>
        <p>Today, Balducci's is owned by Sutton Place Gourmet, a Maryland-based company once renowned for its high-quality food but now better known for its high prices. It's products have never been on the level Balducci's were in its halcyon days.</p>
        <p>With so many third-generation Balduccis available to take over the business, how and why did the stores end up out of the family?</p>
        <p>The answer is a byzantine story, a soap opera in fact, of an immigrant family with jealousies and rivalries over money and power, lawsuits and fistfights outside a courtroom. Interviews with eight members of the Balducci family, seven of whom are children and grandchildren of the store's founders, Louis and Maria Balducci, provide fragments that don't always fit together. Some of the family members still get angry when they discuss the old disputes; others retain their calm. Only Andy Balducci maintains that he has no regrets. Sibling rivalry between Andy, 74, and Charles, 76, dates back more than 70 years, when it became clear that Charles was his father's favorite son, even before he became ''my son the doctor.'' Both of the sons were born in Italy, as was their sister, Grace, 62.</p>
        <p>''Everybody's proud to have a doctor in the family,'' said Andy, the middle child. ''He was older, he always got the best, but I never felt deprived.''</p>
        <p>Andy, his mother's favorite, has spent his life proving that he was better than his older brother, family members say, even though he had only a grade-school education. It was Andy who went into business with his father when he started an open-air fruit and vegetable stand on Greenwich Avenue in 1946.  But Andy had higher aspirations. ''I always thought the store should be a little more sophisticated,'' he said. ''So I put up a sign, 'Balducci Produce,' not fruit and vegetable.''</p>
        <p>In 1952, Andy married Nina D'Amelio. ''Nina didn't want to be married to a man with dirty fingernails, and her father had a business where he was a white collar executive,'' said Andy's cousin Charlie Balducci. In 1953, Andy left to work for his father-in-law, where he made a lot of changes. ''I turned a mason yard into a stone, marble and granite business,'' Andy said. He stayed for 15 years, but was never permitted to buy into the business.</p>
        <p>''I was president of four different corporations and owner of none,'' Andy said. ''My father-in-law asked me to stay, but the answer was no. So I left, and my father-in-law says to me: 'What are you going to do? Go back to sell potatoes?' ''</p>
        <p>Others have different versions about why Andy left, but they all come down to the same thing: Andy wanted to run the show but his temperamental style grated others, and so his father-in-law would not let him.</p>
        <p>The question of style comes up frequently when the subject is Andy Balducci. Those who worked in the store say he put people down. A former employee, who did want to be named, said that whenever Andy screamed, his point was always right but his treatment was abusive.</p>
        <p>One of Andy's nephews, known as Louis B., said in a description confirmed by several other family members, ''Andy has a violent temper,'' but Andy denies it: ''No, I don't lose my temper. I'm opinionated, but so far I haven't killed anyone.''</p>
        <p>Andy returned to his family's business four years before they signed a lease in 1972 to move Balducci's to its current location at Avenue of the Americas and Ninth Street. That's where the humble, but successful, fruit and vegetable market became an emporium of gastronomy. Andy, like most second-generation owners of family businesses, had much bigger dreams than his father.</p>
        <p>''When I went back, I found what I left,'' he said. ''There was no progress at all.''</p>
        <p>Even his critics give him credit for the store's success. His nephew Louis B., the son of Andy's brother, Dr. Charles Balducci, worked in the store for years. ''Andy was the creative and driving force, but he also had an incredible team behind him,'' he said. ''In the 70's and 80's you couldn't touch Balducci's.''</p>
        <p>During the years Andy was working for his father-in-law, his father ran the store with Joe Doria. Andy's sister, Grace, had worked in the store from the time she was 17. She met Joe there. In later years she helped her mother make the prepared food.</p>
        <p>When Andy returned, he wanted more, and that's when the trouble began.</p>
        <p>It is almost impossible to sort out why Louis, the founder of the company, did not sign the 1972 lease for the new store or join the newly formed corporation. Louis died in 1988; his wife, Maria, in 1989. But when all the papers were signed, Louis Balducci had no part of anything he started. The store now belonged to Andy and Nina Balducci and Grace and Joe Doria.</p>
        <p>Charlie Balducci says that Louis, his uncle, had no idea that he had been written out of the store. ''My uncle always thought he owned one-third of the business,'' he said. ''In the early 80's, when I was already working in the business, I was giving him a lift home and he said to me, 'My son is a thief.' And then he shouted at me: 'Do you hear me? My son is a thief.' ''</p>
        <p>Upon hearing that story, Andy said, ''That was Pop's opinion,'' and then after a long pause he added, ''I don't believe my father would say that, knowing my father.''</p>
        <p>Andy said his father ''didn't want to be involved in either the lease or the corporation,'' because he was afraid he might lose everything in the new Village venture. Whatever the facts, Louis Balducci later sued for his share of the partnership, a suit Andy says his brother, Dr. Charles Balducci, put him up to. There are differing versions on how it was resolved and court papers do not discuss the terms of the settlement.</p>
        <p>Some family members say Andy convinced his father, who was then retired, to stay out of the corporation to avoid tax problems. Others suspect that Grace and Joe Doria also played a part in keeping Louis out of the lease. Grace Doria maintains that ''Andy did everything -- we were  just puppets.''</p>
        <p>WHATEVER the reason, the new corporation had four partners: Andy and Nina owned 51 percent; Grace and Joe 49 percent.</p>
        <p>Andy said he explained to Joe: ''Somebody's going to hold the extra share for legal purposes; somebody has to have the last word.'' He continued, ''Joe doesn't want 51 percent. He says, 'No, no, you take it Andy.' I said: 'Understand, this is not about money and profit; but somebody has to take the leadership. We will share the profits 50-50.''</p>
        <p>Grace said that she didn't understand that whoever owns 51 percent is the boss. ''Andy pulled the wool over our eyes and I was naive,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Charles Balducci, her brother, has another take on the situation. He says his father's will called for giving each of his three children a third of the business. The new corporation, Dr. Balducci said, was ''strictly done to get me out of the will.''</p>
        <p>''My motivation for wanting any part of the business was that I wanted it for my son,'' he said of Louis B., who had worked in the store since he was 18. ''My son was so loyal to Balducci's.'' In Dr. Balducci's mind ''the whole purpose of the 49-51 split was to take it away from me.''</p>
        <p>Today, Grace agrees with him. Whoever is correct, once Andy and his wife became majority owners, tension between the Dorias and the Balduccis escalated.</p>
        <p>'''Andy was very demanding,'' Louis B. said. ''Andy wanted everything his way, and that's hard to deal with. Joe and Grace swallowed a lot of things they didn't want.''</p>
        <p>Grace says there was friction for five or six years, that Andy humiliated her and her husband every day. ''The year before we left, Andy put together a press kit and it never mentioned Joe or me,'' she said. ''It was all about them. It was very well planned out, pushing us little by little and degrading Joe very day. When Joe approached Andy about opening a store uptown, Andy said to him: 'You can't take care of one store. How can you take care of two?' ''</p>
        <p>For his part, Andy describes Joe as ''a happy-go-lucky, hard-working man.'' But he added, ''Grace keeps knocking him and saying, 'Why can't you be more like Andy?' 'Grace,' I say, 'leave him alone.' ''</p>
        <p>The charges and countercharges come thick and fast. Grace says that during a meeting with Andy and Nina, Andy grabbed her and shook her; Andy insists that he just tried to calm her down. Whatever happened everyone agrees that one of Grace's sons, Frank, punched Andy after the incident. Grace said that the police were called and that she and her son fled in a taxi.</p>
        <p>Charlie Balducci said he believes that in the end, Andy outgrew his need for Joe. ''For a very handsome salary you can bring in someone with no claim on the business and no baggage like children who might want to come into the business and a wife who gave Nina a hard time,'' a reference to the hard feelings between the sisters-in-law.</p>
        <p>Grace and Joe left Balducci's in 1985. She says her brother offered them $500,000 for their share of the business. So they sued him. Their father sued him at the same time for his share of the business. The case was settled out of court. Joe Doria says Louis Balducci received $2.5 million, the Dorias another $2.5 million. Grace says her father said that he wanted only part of the money and and that the rest should go to the Dorias. Five months later, a specialty market called Grace Balducci's Marketplace opened on Third Avenue at 71st Street.</p>
        <p>Andy disputes the figures and says his father got nothing. ''All my father got was a broken heart,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Joe and Grace got paid for their 50 percent ownership of the business,'' Andy said. ''How much I don't know. It's absolutely wrong that Grace and Joe got $2.5 million. They got a hell of a lot more than $2.5 million. I'm not going to divulge any number. What they are telling you is nonsense. They got more than $5 million. I remember $10 million, but it could be more than that.''</p>
        <p>After Grace and Joe opened their store, Andy sued the Dorias, saying they were not entitled to use the Balducci name.</p>
        <p>ANDY'S mother, Maria, was subpoenaed to testify that her daughter's name was Grace Doria, not Grace Balducci. She submitted two affidavits, the first typewritten in English saying her daughter is known as Grace Doria;  the second in her own handwriting in Italian. In the second she states that she neither reads or writes English and that her daughter is also known as Grace Balducci. Dr. Charles Balducci was in court and was so angry with Andy for subpoenaing their frail mother that ''when we were walking out of the courtroom, I said to Andy: 'What kind of a man are you? You subpoena your mother who has a history of strokes.' I spit in his face. He tried to spit back and then I slapped him across the face. We both ended up on the floor. I am not proud of what I did.''</p>
        <p>Andy acknowledges that incident and says he never hit back. He also said: ''I don't want to get into the details. I didn't subpoena my mother; the lawyer did.''</p>
        <p>Andy Balducci's request for a preliminary injunction to prevent Grace Doria from using the name Grace Balducci's Marketplace was denied as long as her store made clear there was no affiliation with Balducci's in the Village. But not long after, Grace Balducci's became Grace's Marketplace.</p>
        <p>Then, Balducci's was owned by Andy and Nina. Dr. Balducci's son, Louis B., was working for his uncle. Would Louis B., who had risen to manager, be the heir apparent? One thing all the family members agree on is that Louis B. is, as Charlie Balducci said, ''a wonderful retailer with a passion for what he is doing.''</p>
        <p>But Louis B. left Balducci's in the late 80's and became a partner in Agata &amp; Valentina, a similar specialty grocery shop on the Upper East Side that opened in 1993. He said he thought he was the logical person to take over Balducci's, ''but I didn't feel I was going anywhere.''</p>
        <p>''I don't think Andy wanted anyone to take over the business,'' he said. ''I think Andy felt he put his life, his soul, his blood, his guts into it, and I don't think in his heart he wanted to give it to anyone. I don't think he thinks anyone is capable of taking over, including me.''</p>
        <p>But Andy sees it differently: ''I told Louis, 'Someday somebody's going to sit in my chair, and I want it to be you.' But he said he didn't want to do that. He was scared. He was afraid of the mammoth responsibilities.''</p>
        <p>With Louis B. gone, and none of Andy's daughters interested in going into the business, and with his own advancing years, he decided to sell. His sister, Grace, had right of first refusal but decided the store was not worth $26.5 million, the price for which Andy sold it to Sutton Place Gourmet. Andy says he received stock and cash. He and his wife have a five-year consulting contract with Sutton Place.</p>
        <p>When Sutton Place took over in 1999, a number of longtime employees left Balducci's, including Charlie Balducci, who said he did not want to work for a corporation. He now works for Andy Balducci's former son-in-law, Kevin Murphy, who owns Baldor, a produce wholesaler.</p>
        <p>So important is it for Sutton Place to create the impression that there are still Balduccis connected with Balducci's that this month's company newsletter suggests that Alan Butzbach, the vice president of operations, is married to a Balducci daughter. It reads: ''Alan is a native New Yorker and has been a member of the Balducci family for 16 years. Married to Andy and Nina's youngest daughter, Alan spent many years traveling throughout Europe under the tutelage of the Balduccis.''</p>
        <p>The article goes on to refer to the fresh fritattas Mr. Butzbach makes on Sunday mornings for ''his wife and two daughters.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Butzbach has been divorced from the Balducci's youngest daughter for years; she died after they separated. He remarried, and his wife and their daughters are the ones referred to in the article, not the Balduccis' daughter.</p>
        <p>Asked about the article, Mr. Butzbach said: ''It wasn't supposed to come across that way. We are trying to convey that someone connected to the family is in the business.''</p>
        <p>Along with the disappearance of the family and its family-style service, Balducci's has lost some of its luster; the downtown store has begun to look shabby, with chipped and scratched takeout counter cases and long-neglected window displays.</p>
        <p>Andy Balducci says he has no regrets. ''I have no ''</p>
        <p>He does not see Grace either. ''My sister's emotional,'' he said. ''What can I tell you? She'll get over it.</p>
        <p>''I'm happy with what I did. I'm proud of what I did. Why are they bitter?''</p>
