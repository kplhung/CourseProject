        <p>Microscopic particles of air pollutants from tailpipes, power plants and other sources are causing measurable increases in deaths and the hospitalizations of the elderly, a study of the nation's 90 largest metropolitan areas has found.</p>
        <p>The study was conducted by an independent scientific organization financed by auto manufacturers and the Environmental Protection Agency and is scheduled to be released on Wednesday by the Health Effects Institute of Cambridge, Mass.</p>
        <p>It found a 1 percent rise in the death rate for each small increase of tiny particles in the air and a 2 percent to 4 percent increase in hospitalization of the elderly. The quantity of particles -- 20 micrograms per cubic meter -- is equivalent to about seven ten-millionths of an ounce. At that rate, an ounce of the particles added to a five-story building that is 950 feet wide would raise the death rate 1 percent.</p>
        <p>The correlation was strongest in the Northeast, researchers found, and in the New York City area, the increase in the death rate was twice as high as the average of the other cities studied.</p>
        <p>Researchers said the reason was not clear but might be that New York has better monitoring of particulate pollution than some other cities. With a clearer picture of pollution levels, the correlations were stronger. Or, the researchers added, it might be because the tiny particles in the Northeast are made up of different chemicals, tending to be sulfur-oxygen compounds, while in the West, they are more likely to be nitrogen-oxygen compounds.</p>
        <p>Although one percentage point sounds small, government officials said the finding was important because of the huge number of people exposed to particulate pollution. Robert W. Perciasepe, the head of the E.P.A.'s air pollution program, said that elevated particulate levels might occur ''two days this week, two days next week,'' and other times in the year. Considering that this short-term effect could be repeated over and over, and considering that there is probably also a long-term effect, which was not addressed by this study, ''it's thousands of deaths a year.''</p>
        <p>But the study's authors did not give a number of deaths.</p>
        <p>''There is still some work that needs to be done in terms of translating our numbers,'' said Dr. Jonathan Samet, the principal investigator and a researcher with the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health. ''We didn't do that exercise.''</p>
        <p>The study raised another question it did not answer: whether the additional deaths were among frail people whose demise was simply hastened by a few days, or whether the people dying would otherwise have lived for many years. Some air pollution experts blame many of the 5,000 asthma deaths per year on particulate pollution, although they acknowledge that some of those who die have heart and lung problems that would probably have killed them soon anyway.</p>
        <p>The study is only the latest in a series that links particulate emissions to illness and death. Others, in fact, found a larger correlation, but they covered one or a handful of cities. This one is considered by statisticians to be more reliable because it integrates data from a large area.</p>
        <p>In addition, by looking at death rates and particulate concentrations over time, in a variety of different weather conditions, the authors say, it isolates the effect of the particles from the effects of summer heat, or of other pollutants, like smog.</p>
        <p>The study is being published as the E.P.A. is making a major effort to clean up diesel engines, a major source of particulate pollution. The agency has recently proposed sharp reductions in the allowable level of sulfur in diesel fuel and hopes to issue a final rule by the end of the year. The new rule would reduce the tailpipe emissions of sulfur compounds that can form particles, and it would also allow the use of sophisticated catalytic devices that capture nitrogen compounds. The catalytic devices are poisoned by high-sulfur fuel and thus are not practical now.</p>
        <p>The authors, from Johns Hopkins University and the Harvard School of Public Health, wrote that their study provided ''new and strong evidence linking particulate air pollution to adverse health effects.''</p>
        <p>Clean air advocates and government officials familiar with the findings of the report praised it. Mr. Perciasepe said, ''I believe the study substantially validates some of the basic science behind the regulations, with real-world data.''</p>
        <p>At the American Lung Association, Ronald H. White, the director of national programs, said, ''this is additional scientific evidence that supports toughening the standard for particulate matter.'' The study, he noted, does not appear to identify a threshold concentration level, below which particles are safe. That means the government should pursue any strategy to reduce particulate emissions, he added. The current federal limit is an annual average of 50 micrograms per cubic meter and 150 micrograms in a 24-hour period.</p>
        <p>At the Ford Motor Company, which is a sponsor of the institute, Phil Colley, a spokesman, said: ''We respect their findings. We're not arguing with their findings.''</p>
        <p>In a written statement, the company said it would continue developing new technologies to control particulate emissions, and would continue supporting scientific research.</p>
