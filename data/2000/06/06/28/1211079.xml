        <p>REEMTSMA-Keith. The faculty and staff of Columbia University College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons and the New York-Presbyterian Hospital mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Dr. Keith Reemtsma. Internationally recognized as a pioneer of organ transplants and transplantation immunology, Dr. Reemtsma's contributions have had a profound influence in medical education, research and clinical care. He established one of the leading heart transplant programs in the world and co-founded one of the first programs to bioengineer artificial organs. Dr. Reemtsma was the first to show that non-human organs could successfully be transplanted into humans and was devoted to finding a cure for diabetes through the transplantation of islet cells. Dr. Reemtsma received his surgical training at Columbia University and later returned as Chairman of the Department of Surgery in 1971. He was a trusted advisor to generations of medical students and faculty. A long time friend and colleague whose many contributions enriched the field of medicine, he will be greatly missed and his memory cherished. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Judy, his sons Dirk and Lance, and to the entire Reemtsma family. Thomas Q. Morris, M.D, Interim Dean for Clinical &amp; Educational Affairs Columbia University College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons David Hirsh, Ph.D. Interim Dean for Research Columbia University College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons Herbert Pardes, M.D. President &amp; CEO New York-Presbyterian Hospital</p>
