        <p>A mother and son who were convicted of killing an Upper East Side woman in a plot to seize her town house proclaimed their innocence yesterday in bizarre, rambling and sometimes vulgar statements before a judge, who then sentenced them both to life in prison.</p>
        <p>A jury on May 18 had found Sante Kimes, 65, and her son, Kenneth, 25, guilty of murdering Irene Silverman, whose body has not been found. Yesterday, Judge Rena K. Uviller of State Supreme Court in Manhattan sentenced Mrs. Kimes to 120 2/3 years to life in prison, and her son to 126 1/3 years to life.</p>
        <p>Judge Uviller described Mrs. Kimes as a ''sociopath'' of ''unremitting malevolence'' and her son as a ''vacuous dupe'' who had evolved into a ''remorseless predator'' under his mother's influence.</p>
        <p>The sentence capped a bizarre day in which Sante and Kenneth Kimes railed against their own lawyers, the police, the district attorney and the judge in meandering statements. Mr. Kimes even accused Judge Uviller of using hand signals to conspire with prosecutors throughout the trial.</p>
        <p>''All of our precious civil and constitutional rights were trampled,'' Mrs. Kimes said. ''Much like the witch hunts of old Salem, the police planted and planted and planted evidence to fool the jury. No one has been told the truth in this case.''</p>
        <p>The grandiosity and self-pity of their statements came as little surprise to more than a dozen detectives who sat in the jury box yesterday to watch the sentencing. They had searched for Mrs. Silverman's body without success but had uncovered what they have called a trail of fraud, theft, arson, identify theft and murder that stretched from Hawaii to Las Vegas to the Bahamas.</p>
        <p>They also turned up 14 notebooks in which Mrs. Kimes, whose son had rented an apartment in Mrs. Silverman's house in 1998, wrote of her plan to murder the wealthy socialite, dispose of her body, then assume her identity and steal her town house, which is valued at $7.7 million. The notebooks, along with a forged deed to the house, allowed prosecutors to build a successful murder case, even without a body.</p>
        <p>The Kimeses' legal battles do not end in New York. They are expected to stand trial in Los Angeles on charges that they killed a former business associate, David J. Kazdin, whose body was found in a garbage bin near Los Angeles International Airport.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kimes's lawyer, Michael Hardy, argued before the sentencing yesterday that his client was not so evil that she deserved to die in jail. ''Is Ms. Kimes a Hitler?'' he asked. ''Is she a Mussolini? Is she a Jack the Ripper?''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kimes's statement did little to soften her image as she criticized almost everyone who had participated in her trial, then proclaimed it ''the first time in United States history that an innocent mother and son have been convicted of a crime that didn't happen.''</p>
        <p>Judge Uviller urged her to come to the point, but as Mr. Hardy intervened in an effort to stop her from speaking further and hurting her chances of appeal, Mrs. Kimes went on to say that ''the only murderers in this case are the prosecutors, for murdering our Constitution.''</p>
        <p>When Mrs. Kimes exceeded her allotted time, Judge Uviller interrupted and said, ''Ms. Kimes, your performance, I mean your statement, is over.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimes's lawyer, Mel Sachs, then tried to distinguish his client from Mrs. Kimes by saying that the son did not have the luxury in life of choosing his own mother and that unlike her, he felt remorse.</p>
        <p>But Kenneth Kimes then gave a long, disjointed and venomous speech that was anything but remorseful. He began by saying that his mother was afraid of law enforcement officials. He then turned to the detectives in the jury box and said, ''No offense, but you're spooky.''</p>
        <p>He went on to accuse a witness in the California case of murdering Mrs. Silverman, to claim that he had been illegally interrogated and to complain about the exclusion of Court TV from the courtroom.</p>
        <p>In the sentencing, Judge Uviller first spoke of Mrs. Silverman as someone who embodied the best of New York City and was interested in its ''buzz,'' opening her home to boarders without regard to ''class, education or wealth.'' Then she described Mrs. Kimes as ''the most degenerate defendant who has ever appeared in this courtroom.''</p>
        <p>As the judge made her remarks and imposed the maximum sentences, the mother and son sat silently. When they were led from the courtroom, Detective Anthony Vasquez called out from the jury box, ''You have plenty of time to tell us where Irene Silverman is.''</p>
