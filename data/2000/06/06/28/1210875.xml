        <p>AT Esca, the most important word in the Italian language is crudo. It means raw, and that's the way the fish comes to the table in a dazzling array of appetizers that could be thought of as Italian sushi, except there's no rice, or as Italy's answer to ceviche, except the fish doesn't sit long enough in its pool of olive oil and lemon to ''cook.''</p>
        <p>Joe Bastianich and Mario Batali, the impresarios behind Esca, insist that their way with raw fish is a venerable Italian tradition, indulged by humble fishermen up north along the Adriatic coast and down south from Naples to Sicily, but it's a little hard to imagine hard-laboring pescatori mincing tiny radishes and plucking baby greens to garnish their catch of the day. It pays to remember that Mr. Batali is the man who gave the world squid cooked ''Sicilian lifeguard style,'' an instant classic at Babbo that did not exist until he thought of it.</p>

        <p>AT Esca, the most important word in the Italian language is crudo. It means raw, and that's the way the fish comes to the table in a dazzling array of appetizers that could be thought of as Italian sushi, except there's no rice, or as Italy's answer to ceviche, except the fish doesn't sit long enough in its pool of olive oil and lemon to ''cook.''</p>
        <p>Joe Bastianich and Mario Batali, the impresarios behind Esca, insist that their way with raw fish is a venerable Italian tradition, indulged by humble fishermen up north along the Adriatic coast and down south from Naples to Sicily, but it's a little hard to imagine hard-laboring pescatori mincing tiny radishes and plucking baby greens to garnish their catch of the day. It pays to remember that Mr. Batali is the man who gave the world squid cooked ''Sicilian lifeguard style,'' an instant classic at Babbo that did not exist until he thought of it.</p>
        <p>It matters not. The crudo appetizers at Esca are the freshest, most exciting thing to happen to Italian food in recent memory. Mr. Batali and Mr. Bastianich, who are also partners in such successes as Po, Babbo and Lupa, have engaged the services of David Pasternack of Picholine as chef, and in his hands, the crudo formula shows remarkable flexibility. By changing olive oils, adding a bitter green, or throwing in a scattering of minced chilies, Mr. Pasternack works thrilling variations on a very simple theme. Pink snapper takes nothing more than a sprinkling of coarse sea salt. Fluke, another mild fish, is topped with a few spindly sea beans and tiny radish slivers.</p>
        <p>At the far end of the flavor spectrum, full-flavored bluefish can stand up to more aggressive treatment: a robust olive oil from Tuscany, green chilies chopped to near-molecular tininess and filaments of mint. In this department, ingenuity knows no bounds. A splash of tangerine oil adds just the right bitter note to underline the sweetness in raw scallops. A few leaves of salad burnet give freshness and bite to gope, a Mediterranean fish something similar to a small sardine.</p>
        <p>Fish is the thing at Esca, whose name means bait, and whose menu changes daily depending on what comes out of the sea. Look hard enough, and you can find a dish like guinea hen with fingerling potatoes and broccoli rape, or roast chicken with spring greens and cippoline onions, but it seems perverse to order anything but seafood. You get the hint at the start of each meal, when a waiter brings over a plate of bruschetta loaded up with a creamy topping of mackerel, beans and onions. It's simple but arresting.</p>
        <p>The same could be said for much of the menu. Firm, meaty grilled octopus, a characteristic appetizer, comes surrounded with almost cartoonish-looking giant corona beans, the porterhouse steaks of the bean kingdom. Sorrento lemons and a rosemary vinaigrette make this an octopus to remember, but there's an even better octopus dish in the pasta department, bucatini with a spicy octopus sauce, made crunchy with a dusting of toasted bread crumbs. The pasta at Esca tends to be oversauced, but there's no such thing as too much of this one.</p>
        <p>Often a single, standout ingredient carries an entire dish. Baked branzino, or sea bass, a special one evening, looked as plain as a sheet of blank paper, nothing more than a big deboned fish with some olive oil, caperberries and a handful of giant Sicilian olives. But oh, those olives. Baking had turned them into 100-megaton flavor bombs that released a complex, ravishing juice, earthy, winy and spicy all at once. Caprese salad, an old standby, makes a comeback here thanks to an incomparable buffalo mozzarella from Naples, fluffy inside, but firm to the bite, with the thrillingly sour tang missing from nearly every cheese that, insolently, appropriates the name.</p>
        <p>About half the menu consists of knockouts. Half is rather ordinary, although the surroundings at Esca can trick any diner into believing otherwise. The former Frico Bar has been reconfigured and redecorated, with great success. The lemon-yellow walls and sea-green tiles give it a bright, cool look, and the solid wooden table in the center of the dining room, loaded down with vegetable side dishes, strikes a rustic note while communicating the food philosophy: fresh from the market, and prepared without fuss. A long bar in the adjoining room shows off seafood on ice. When it comes to atmospherics, Esca hits the high notes without a quaver. The stellar wine list, a budget-priced tour of every corner of Italy, also provides a brilliant diversion when the food sags a bit.</p>
        <p>For a restaurant that worships fish, a fair amount of it comes to the table either slightly or very overcooked. Such was the fate of halibut with raw artichokes and Cerignola olives one evening, and pagrus, or sea bream, with olive pesto. Turbot cooked in parchment with leeks and salsify was done in by the addition of too much Cinzano vermouth. Spaghetti with lobster failed to get off the ground; the chili was subtly hot, the mint was cool, but somehow the flavors failed to strike a deal with the lobster. There are a fair number of dishes like these at Esca. They read better than they taste.</p>
        <p>The service, too, perplexes. It strikes the wrong tone. The waiters are attentive and solicitous, but a little too formal for what is, at heart, a simple trattoria in a fairly funky patch of Manhattan. A little less preciousness in the presentation would help matters. And a little more speed. Lunch can easily break the two-hour barrier. Esca is a lovely place to pass the time, but eventually, even the most infatuated diners want to move on to the next phase in their lives.</p>
        <p>That brings us to the second-most-important bit of Italian at Esca. It's ''Il conto, per favore.'' It means ''Check, please.''</p>
