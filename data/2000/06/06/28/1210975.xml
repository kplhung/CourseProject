      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Black residents of New York City are afraid of being brutalized by the police, but they welcome and appreciate officers who keep criminals out of their neighborhood.</p>
        <p>At all income levels, blacks in the city are convinced that racial discrimination limits their income and holds back job advancement. Yet they also believe that the major reason that young black men have troubled lives is not discrimination, but the breakdown of black families and a lack of personal motivation.</p>
        <p>Amid New York's economic boom, with overall unemployment at a 12-year low, blacks in the city say their most important problem is a lack of jobs. But they are convinced that their children will be more successful than they have been.</p>
        <p>These ambivalent attitudes are part of a wide-ranging State of Black New York poll conducted this month for the New York Urban League. Based on random telephone interviews with 801 blacks across the city, the survey paints a portrait of a community on edge, one that feels victimized by unemployment, police brutality and racial discrimination.</p>
        <p>But it also shows that most blacks are optimistic about the future, deeply committed to their churches and introspective about a breakdown in black family life, which they link to the poor performance of many young blacks in schools and the workplace.</p>
        <p>''I thought there would be more consistency,'' said Dennis M. Walcott, president of the New York Urban League, who helped write the questions in the poll. ''The relationship between the local cop and the black community is not as strained or as simple as has been portrayed in the media.''</p>
        <p>Another surprise in the poll was the relative lack of support among New York blacks for school vouchers.</p>
        <p>While blacks had serious concerns about the quality of public schools, only 41 percent of those polled supported using tax money for vouchers. Fifty-three percent said tax money should be used for only public education.</p>
        <p>The findings differ from most nationwide polls of blacks, which have found support for vouchers running about 60 percent.</p>
        <p>Support for vouchers, as measured by the poll, increased sharply among New York blacks as income decreased. A narrow majority of households with yearly incomes under $10,000 supported vouchers. But at income levels above $50,000, there was strong opposition to shifting public money to private schools.</p>
        <p>Income made little difference, though, in the perception among blacks in New York that racial discrimination stains nearly every aspect of their lives.</p>
        <p>''This survey shows that no matter how successful black people become, they still suffer the slings and arrows of racism,'' Mr. Walcott said. ''Whether it is engagement with the police department or issues involving promotion or disparity in wages, the figures show that people feel that racism has touched their lives.''</p>
        <p>Asked to name places where racial discrimination was most common, the greatest proportion of those polled, 30 percent, mentioned stores, where blacks have long complained about being followed by clerks and security officers.</p>
        <p>Based on their perception of discrimination, more than four out of five respondents said that affirmative action was still needed in jobs and schools. Support for affirmative action was strongest in households earning more than $50,000 a year.</p>
        <p>''What jumps out at me from this survey is the emphasis on jobs and economic development,'' said Walter Stafford, a professor of public policy and urban planning at New York University who analyzed the poll for the Urban League. ''Across the board, people tend to perceive discrimination in access to jobs and mobility -- even at high income levels.''</p>
        <p>The city's unemployment rate in 1999 was 11.8 percent for black men and 10.4 percent for women, compared with a citywide average of 6.7 percent last year. Black men and women had nearly double the unemployment rates of whites in 1999.</p>
        <p>''What also strikes me is that this is not a secure group,'' Professor Stafford said, pointing to results showing that 53 percent of respondents said they had no pensions other than Social Security.</p>
        <p>The survey, from June 5 to 16, was done for the New York Urban League by Blum &amp; Weprin Associates, a New York polling firm. About 70 percent of the respondents identified themselves as black or African-American; about 30 percent said they were Caribbean or West Indian blacks.</p>
        <p>Many of the poll's findings, particularly those concerning black attitudes toward the police, echo some results of two recent polls by The New York Times and CBS News. Those polls were conducted after the police shooting of Amadou Diallo in February 1999 and the shooting of Patrick M. Dorismond this March.</p>
        <p>Compared with The Times' polls, which surveyed New Yorkers of all races, the Urban League survey contacted three to five times as many black respondents in the city, making it relatively more precise in assessing black views. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
        <p>The Urban League survey found a deep and pervasive ambivalence among black New Yorkers in their attitudes toward the police. While they feel that the police disproportionately victimize them because they are black, they also want police protection against crime, the poll found.</p>
        <p>''It is like straddling a fence,'' said Lileathea Grays-Wallace, 44, a divorced mother of three who lives in the South Bronx and who participated in the poll. ''I am worried about the police on one side and the criminals on the other.''</p>
        <p>Like 45 percent of those polled in the survey, Ms. Grays-Wallace said that she believed that the police in her immediate neighborhood (she lives a block from a police station) did a good-to-excellent job of being helpful and friendly.</p>
        <p>''But four blocks down, I don't know,'' said Ms. Grays-Wallace, who, like nearly 9 of out 10 respondents in the survey, said police brutality was a ''serious problem.''</p>
        <p>Her oldest daughter works as a dispatcher for the police department, she said. Still, she said she was afraid that her younger daughters, who are 13 and 8, would say the wrong thing to the police on the street and be arrested or abused.</p>
        <p>''It is a miscommunication thing,'' she said. ''I tell my daughters they will be judged by what they look like. I explain to them to keep their senses up and show respect.''</p>
        <p>This simultaneous need for and fear of the police has overwhelmed the life of Daisy Boyd, 77, who lives in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn and also participated in the poll.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, her son, Daniel Lee, then 30, was shot to death in front of her apartment when he tried to chase away gang members selling drugs, Mrs. Boyd said. Last week, she said that another son, Jasper, 33, was arrested by the police and was forced to spend a night in jail after he tried to stop a fight outside a homeless shelter in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''It hurt my son so bad to be arrested that he just cried, and he is a college graduate,'' Mrs. Boyd said. ''Some of the police are just mean. They don't like the black man, no way. The police seem to be pretty nice to me, but they are not so nice to the young people.''</p>
        <p>The Urban League poll avoided questions about politics and politicians, other than to ask if the withdrawal of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani from the Senate race would make black residents more or less likely to vote in November. About three-quarters of those polled said the withdrawal of the mayor, who is widely blamed by blacks for worsening racial tensions in the city, would not affect their interest in voting.</p>
        <p>Supporting the longstanding importance of the church in black communities, the poll found religion plays a significant role in the lives of an overwhelming majority of black New Yorkers. Nearly four out of five respondents said that religion is either extremely or very important, while 61 percent said they attended church at least once a month and 35 percent said that they volunteer at least 5 hours a month at their church.</p>
        <p>''Across all income levels, the church is important,'' said Mr. Walcott of the New York Urban League.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walcott said that high levels of religious involvement are connected to what he described as the poll's findings of ''introspection on the part of the black community.''</p>
        <p>''The poll got at the issue of family structure and how it contributes to a lack of success for young black men,'' he said. ''It also talked about family dysfunction as a reason for poor performance in school. The black community isn't solely dealing with external conditions such as racism. It is also aware of the internal issues that need to be addressed for equal opportunity to be achieved.''</p>
        <p>As much as black New Yorkers say they feel oppressed by discrimination, only about 11 percent felt that the quality of life in the city had grown worse in the last five years. Forty-four percent felt that the quality of life had remained about the same and 43 percent said it had improved.</p>
        <p>Ms. Grays-Wallace, the mother in the South Bronx, is among those blacks in the city who are upset about racism and afraid of the police for her children. But she says she believes that her life and that of her children is improving.</p>
        <p>''Everything is just a little better, just a little calmer,'' she said. ''It is not relaxed. New Yorkers do not relax.''</p>
