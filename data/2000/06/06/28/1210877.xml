        <p>LIKE so many fermented products -- cheese, wine and pickles, for example -- kimchi began as a way of preserving a bounty that would otherwise go bad. Anyone who has seen the huge piles of cabbage harvested annually in Korea knows that it cannot all be eaten in the next days or weeks. Pickling allows the cabbage to be kept for months.</p>
        <p>There is also a tradition of making kimchi for immediate consumption, although even that might be more work than most people would want on a weeknight. But it is easy enough to take the basic ingredients and flavors of kimchi and create a fast cabbage salad that puts ordinary coleslaw to shame. Use this as a bed for grilled beef -- or anything else that has the flavor to stand up to it -- and you have a great summer dish.</p>

        <p>There is also a tradition of making kimchi for immediate consumption, although even that might be more work than most people would want on a weeknight. But it is easy enough to take the basic ingredients and flavors of kimchi and create a fast cabbage salad that puts ordinary coleslaw to shame. Use this as a bed for grilled beef -- or anything else that has the flavor to stand up to it -- and you have a great summer dish.</p>
        <p>Quick kimchi takes very little work, but the cabbage is best if salted and allowed to sit for an hour or longer, drawing out excess water and making the cabbage ultracrisp. Skip that step if you're pressed for time; the salad will taste just as good.</p>
        <p>All kimchi packs a punch, thanks to plenty of garlic and chili peppers, and I have included appropriate quantities of those here. Increase the amounts if you like, though these should be strong enough.</p>
        <p>If you can get to a Korean market, buy some of the ground chili powder labeled co chu karo, which is hot but also flavorful. Otherwise substitute any good ground chilies or crushed red pepper flakes. Fish sauce is traditional (in truth, dried oysters or dried shrimp are traditional, but fish sauce has the same character), although you can use soy sauce if you prefer.</p>
        <p>I grill the flank steak with nothing but salt and pepper; a drizzle of the salad dressing on top gives it plenty of additional flavor. Grilled pork, shrimp, tuna or chicken (legs, for best flavor) would also be good.</p>
        <p>GRILLED FLANK STEAK WITH KIMCHI-STYLE COLESLAW  Time: About an hour, plus at least one hour's resting</p>
        <p>1 small head Napa or Savoy cabbage, about 1 1/2 pounds</p>
        <p>Coarse salt</p>
        <p>3 spring onions or 6 large scallions, trimmed and chopped</p>
        <p>3 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon co chu karo or crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon peeled and minced ginger</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons fish sauce or soy sauce</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons rice wine or other vinegar</p>
        <p>1 flank steak, about 1 1/2 pounds</p>
        <p>Ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>1. Remove tough exterior leaves of cabbage; core it by cutting a cone-shape wedge out of the stem end. Shred cabbage into thin strips, and separate the strips by hand. Put in a colander, and toss with about 1 tablespoon salt and the onions or scallions. Let sit for at least an hour, preferably two, tossing occasionally, until cabbage wilts.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, prepare a grill. Combine garlic, co chu karo, ginger, fish sauce and vinegar in a bowl. Grill steak for about 4 minutes to a side for medium rare (more time or less according to the degree of doneness you prefer), turning once. Sprinkle steak with salt and pepper as it cooks.</p>
        <p>3. Remove steak from grill, and let it rest. Squeeze as much liquid as you can out of the cabbage, and toss it with dressing. To serve, carve steak. Place a portion of cabbage on a plate, and top with slices of steak. Spoon a little dressing over steak, and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
