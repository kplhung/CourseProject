        <p>The 24-hour cable news competition, it appears, is continuing to close in on CNN, which, until the mid-1990's, was the only national all-news network.</p>
        <p>CNBC, the financial network, was watched in more homes per day than CNN during the second quarter of 2000, representing the first quarterly ratings period in which that has happened.

        <p>The 24-hour cable news competition, it appears, is continuing to close in on CNN, which, until the mid-1990's, was the only national all-news network.</p>
        <p>CNBC, the financial network, was watched in more homes per day than CNN during the second quarter of 2000, representing the first quarterly ratings period in which that has happened. CNBC was watched in an average of 280,000 homes per day compared with 253,000 for CNN from April through late June, according to Nielsen Media Research statistics.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, CNN faced increased competition from the Fox News Channel. Its household audience grew by 20 percent, an average 132,000 households, between the second quarter of 1999 and the second quarter of 2000.</p>
        <p>During that same period CNN's audience decreased by 35 percent, marking its worst second quarter in a decade.</p>
        <p>CNN executives, who recently celebrated the channel's 20th anniversary, have been contending with reports about their ratings for some time now and have blamed the figures on a slow news period.</p>
        <p>They have maintained that Fox and CNBC have separate reasons for their audience gains. While the overall news cycle is slow, there has been plenty of significant financial news for CNBC. And Fox's 20 percent growth in audience coincides with a 22 percent gain in subscribing households.</p>
        <p>Then again, MSNBC is in 14 percent more households than it was last year, yet its audience was 17 percent smaller.</p>
        <p>CNN did have some positive news: it had 19 of the top 20 most-watched programs among all-news channels during the period.</p>
