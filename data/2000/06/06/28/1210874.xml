        <p>ONE of the most remarkable figures in the French wine business, Jean-Michel Cazes, has retired at 65. Sort of. In 1986, when the conventional wisdom held that most French businessmen were still trapped in the dark ages, Mr. Cazes was already well ahead of the crowd.</p>
        <p>With his friend Claude Bebear, Mr. Cazes was running a successful insurance agency in Pauillac, in the center of the Bordeaux wine country. He was also the owner of Chateau Lynch-Bages and other wine properties. Mr. Bebear was the president and managing director of Axa, a huge insurance group. The two had met in the 1950's when they were students and playing rugby in Paris.</p>
        <p>Axa had decided to get into the wine business, and Mr. Bebear asked his friend about buying Cantenac Brown, a well-known wine chateau in Bordeaux. Mr. Cazes told him to do it. But another group, Compagnie du Midi, outbid Axa. Mr. Bebear waited and then bought Compagnie du Midi.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, he asked Mr. Cazes to head a new subsidiary called Axa-Millesimes, formed expressly for buying and developing wine properties. Under French law, insurance companies must invest part of their assets in French real estate. In the 1980's, as the Bordeaux wine trade came out of a decade's slump, the big insurance companies began to move. As a French newspaper said at the time: ''They bought Paris, then they bought the forests; now they want to buy Bordeaux.''</p>
        <p>Working together, Mr. Bebear and Mr. Cazes assembled a top-line portfolio, which includes the Pichon-Longueville Baron, Cantenac Brown, Suduiraut and Petit Village chateaus in Bordeaux and, moving away from France, the Quinta do Noval, a Port producer in the Duoro Valley in Portugal, and the Disznoko estate in Hungary, which makes Tokay.</p>
        <p>They are always attracted by high-quality properties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cazes took on Axa-Millesimes while continuing to manage his family's holdings, which include Lynch-Bages, Chateau Les Ormes de Pez in St.-Estephe and Villa Belair, a chateau in the Graves region, south of Bordeaux. Of course, there is still the insurance agency in Pauillac and, almost next door to Lynch-Bages, where he lives, Chateau Cordeillan-Bages, once a minor wine estate and now an elegant small hotel and restaurant, with its own vineyard and a wine school.</p>
        <p>Lynch-Bages is the jewel in the Cazes diadem. In the famous 1855 classification of the 60 top Bordeaux chateaus, it was placed in the fifth or lowest group. Under Mr. Cazes, Lynch-Bages has become one of the finest of the rated chateaus. Today, it is informally considered among the best of the original 60.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cazes's retirement implies no change in his frantic pace. It means only that he is 65, and Axa says he has to give up that side of his life. His friend Claude Bebear has to go, too.</p>
        <p>The Cazes family was not born to the chateau life. It came from the Pyrenees, near the Spanish border, farmers and shepherds for centuries. The first Cazes to arrive in the Bordeaux region in the mid-1800's was named Jean. His second son, Jean-Charles Cazes, became a baker, worked for a bank and then opened his insurance agency in 1927. In 1933, he became a tenant farmer at Lynch-Bages, buying it outright five years later. In 1940, he bought Les Ormes de Pez.</p>
        <p>Andre Cazes, his son and Jean-Michel's father, took over the insurance business in 1945, after five years as a prisoner of war of the Germans. In 1949, Andre Cazes was elected mayor of Pauillac, a post he held for 42 years.</p>
        <p>Jean-Michel Cazes planned a life away from Bordeaux and wine. After graduating from France's M.I.T., the Ecole National des Mines in Paris, he spent a year studying petroleum engineering at the University of Texas in Austin. Back in France and in the Air Force, he was exposed to computers for the first time, which led to 12 years with I.B.M. in Paris. By 1973, his father needed help in Pauillac, and the younger Mr. Cazes went home. They began a 15-year renovation program at Lynch-Bages and Les Ormes de Pez.</p>
        <p>They decided, too, to make Lynch-Bages a top quality wine. A second label was created, Haut-Bages-Averous, and henceforth only the best vats of wines were used in Lynch-Bages. The rest went, as it does today, into Haut-Bages-Averous.</p>
        <p>For more than a century, Bordeaux was dominated by a small, clannish and powerful group of merchants who bought the wine from each chateau, aged it and bottled it in their own cellars on a section of the Bordeaux waterfront known as the Quai des Chartrons. The Chartronnais, as they were called, set prices, lent money and called in mortgages at will.</p>
        <p>One of the first to break the stranglehold of the Chartronnais was Baron Philippe de Rothschild, at Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, who insisted on bottling and selling his own wine. Alexis Lichine is often credited with dragging the old conservatives into the 20th century with his use of marketing and promotion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cazes, partly with Axa's help but mostly on his own, has emphasized the global dimensions of the Bordeaux wine trade. Thanks in part to his example, the younger Bordelais are as comfortable flying off to Bangkok for a sales meeting as their fathers were dashing off to London for a couple of Savile Row suits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cazes still has a seat on the Axa Millesimes board. He also owns a wine wholesaling business and part of a company that makes wine management software. He is grand master of the Commanderie du Bontemps, a chateau owners promotional group.</p>
        <p>He is also looking at vineyard and winery investments around the world, including other properties in Bordeaux.</p>
        <p>But he insisted: ''I am going to cut back. Really. I'm going to retire from my insurance business next year, and my wife and I are going to travel more.''</p>
        <p>''Anyway,'' he added, almost guiltily, ''the Interenet, e-mail and a good connection allow everyone to keep in touch from anywhere.'' Some retirement.</p>
