        <p>It was on Thanksgiving Day in Dublin in 1949 that J. P. Donleavy had the idea for the novel that would change his life. He and his friends, many of them Americans studying at Trinity College on the G.I. Bill, were leaving the school. They were all headed in different directions, professionally as well as geographically.</p>
        <p>As he recalled during a recent visit to New York from his home in Ireland, he suddenly realized, ''This is all over: Trinity and the world that we knew in Dublin,'' a world that he has described as ''celebratory, boisterous and resolutely careless mayhem.'' He decided to memorialize the high and rough times in print. At the center was a fellow American, Gainor Stephen Crist, who became the model for Sebastian Dangerfield, the title character in his novel, ''The Ginger Man.''</p>
        <p>In a later book, ''The History of the Ginger Man,'' Mr. Donleavy called Crist ''a pagan sensualist,'' while making it clear that he also always expressed moral values. His motto was, ''Do no evil.''</p>
        <p>''To me, he has to be regarded as a saint -- as simple as that,'' Mr. Donleavy said. ''I'm hoping that the tourist board in Ireland will, at some future date, say, 'Saint Gainor Stephen Crist, guide to all tourists in Ireland.' ''</p>
        <p>When Maurice Girodias published ''The Ginger Man'' in Paris in 1955, adding it to his list of erotic books, it became a scandalous event. But the novel was subsequently acclaimed, especially by other writers. Dorothy Parker called it ''a rigadoon of rascality, a bawled-out comic song of sex.'' Capturing the rebellious spirit of its time, along with ''The Catcher in the Rye'' it was taken up by students as a kind of monument to iconoclasm. Eventually it became an international best seller. ''The Ginger Man'' has sold more than 10 million copies and has never been out of print.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donleavy's play based on the novel has had numerous productions, although the current revival at the Irish Arts Center, performed by a company of actors from Dublin, is the first New York production since it was done off Broadway in 1963. Mr. Donleavy, 74, was in New York for the revival, one of his periodic returns to the city of his birth.</p>
        <p>The perfect personification of a dignified country squire -- the opposite of the pub-crawling young men in his book -- and wearing his customary tweeds, he looked as if he had just come from a walk in the Irish countryside. Since 1967 he has been an Irish citizen. For almost 30 years he has lived on a 180-acre estate called Levington Park in Mullingar, Ireland -- a working farm where he raises cattle and also has a soccer field and an indoor swimming pool.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, when the Modern Library named the 100 best novels in the English language in the 20th century, ''The Ginger Man'' was 99th, just ahead of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' by Booth Tarkington. No. 1 was James Joyce's ''Ulysses.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Donleavy greeted that lowly position without rancor, while saying, ''Some of my friends were outraged that I was at the bottom.'' In common with many others on the list, ''The Ginger Man'' is generally accepted as a contemporary classic.</p>
        <p>The novel brought the author fame and, at first, a certain degree of misfortune. After it was rejected by scores of publishers in the United States and England -- the number varies from 35 to 45 -- Mr. Donleavy left New York for Ireland, where his parents lived before coming to the United States.</p>
        <p>Back in Dublin, he was at a loss as to what to do with the novel. A friend, the playwright Brendan Behan, read the manuscript and filled it with a profusion of mostly helpful editorial comments and corrections. He suggested that Mr. Donleavy send it to Girodias, head of the Olympia Press in Paris. Behan had himself tried to write a pornographic novel for Olympia and been turned down. He thought Mr. Donleavy might have better luck -- and he did, in a manner of speaking.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Donleavy's dismay, the book was published by Girodias (in paperback) in the Traveler's Companion series of pornographic, mostly pseudonymous novels. In the back of the first edition, it was listed alongside such titles as ''White Thighs'' and ''The Sexual Life of Robinson Crusoe.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Donleavy said that Girodias published his novel ''to cloak his dealings as a pornographer -- he never thought the book would ever make a penny.'' Because of the imprint, ''The Ginger Man'' was regarded as something illegitimate.</p>
        <p>''That was basically the end of my career,'' he said. ''I was 'a dirty book writer' out of Paris.''</p>
        <p>He vowed to take revenge on his publisher and to regain control of his book. Through more than 20 years of litigation, Girodias tied up the rights, one reason the novel was not filmed despite interest from movie companies. (In recent years, Mr. Donleavy's son Philip has been trying to put together a film production of the novel.) Largely as a result of his conflict with the publisher, Mr. Donleavy became a legal expert and began drawing up his own contracts. Not only did he win his case, but he also ended up buying Olympia at auction. In a final twist, the original edition of the book is a valuable collector's item.</p>
        <p>The turning point in the novel's reputation came, the author said, when in an interview John Osborne welcomed Mr. Donleavy as an American cousin of Britain's Angry Young Men. As Mr. Donleavy later discovered, Osborne had apparently read ''The Ginger Man'' before he wrote ''Look Back in Anger.'' Despite differences in the works, both Dangerfield and Osborne's Jimmy Porter are rebels thumbing their noses at accepted behavior.</p>
        <p>Speaking about his first novel, he remembered his friend Gainor Crist, who died in the early 1960's. With Crist, he said, he can't ''separate fiction from reality,'' but whenever he and their mutual friend George Roy Hill, the film director, would get together they would swap stories about the charismatic Crist. Irrepressibly convivial, Crist would talk to anyone in a bar or on the street and, in hindsight, turn that person into ''an incredible individual.''</p>
        <p>Crist read parts of ''The Ginger Man'' as it was written. ''He was very much impressed by it but never thought it had much to do with him,'' Mr. Donleavy said. He did, however, recognize a few events, including the farcical scene in which the ceiling of his apartment collapsed. For a while Crist taught English in Spain, and later he worked for an airline in New York. Welcoming foreign dignitaries, he ran up an astronomical bar bill. The name Dangerfield was a tribute to Crist: it was his favorite name for an Englishman.</p>
        <p>At first, Mr. Donleavy called the novel ''SB'' or ''Sebastian Dangerfield,'' but he changed the title at the request of Girodias, who also rejected his other choice, ''His Hands Refuse to Labor.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Donleavy, who said he had never suffered from writer's block, went on to write more than a dozen novels (his latest in 1998) and several plays, as well as nonfiction. He has written sequels to other books, but ''The Ginger Man'' is singular: ''I guess that it had a degree of finality about it in this period and time.'' The end of the book is the end of Dangerfield's story:</p>
        <p>God's mercy</p>
        <p>On the Wild</p>
        <p>Ginger Man.</p>
        <p>Although he has always retained his independence from anything resembling a literary movement, Mr. Donleavy is well aware that in recent years Ireland has become a far more hospitable place for writers. ''Ireland has gone mad with authors,'' he said, and with the mischievousness of Dangerfield, he added, ''I think they should all go out and get decent jobs.''</p>
