        <p>The Justice Department sought to curb the headlong consolidation of the telecommunications industry yesterday by moving to block WorldCom's proposed $115 billion acquisition of the Sprint Corporation.</p>
        <p>At the same time, in the face of opposition in Europe, WorldCom and Sprint formally withdrew their deal from consideration by the European Commission, reserving the option to file again in the future.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department, while  seeking an injunction against the deal in Federal court, cited concerns that the combined company would stifle competition on the Internet and in the long-distance telephone industry. Industry executives said the filing probably doomed the deal, which was agreed to last year and would have created an Internet powerhouse and the nation's second-largest long-distance phone company after AT&amp;T. Two days ago, the European Commission's top antitrust regulator said he was unlikely to support the deal, contending that it would place too much Internet traffic under control of one company.</p>
        <p>Regarding their plans, the companies said only that they would review their options. WorldCom and Sprint could fight the government in court, but executives from the companies have said in the past that they would almost surely abandon their deal in the face of a government suit.</p>
        <p>People close to the companies said that while Sprint and WorldCom remained unlikely to battle the Justice Department through an entire trial, they might file preliminary objections to the suit in hopes of reopening negotiations to win approval.</p>
        <p>Shares of Sprint fell $1.1875, to $58.375, while Worldcom stock rose $2.1875, to $39.6875.</p>
        <p>The attempted merger is the biggest the department has ever tried to block, dwarfing the previous largest -- Lockheed Martin's $8.3 billion plan to acquire Northrop Grumman, which would have created a behemoth in the military industry. Lockheed and Northrop abandoned their pact in 1998 in the face of the Justice Department's opposition.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's move indicates that the Justice Department intends to draw limits, even amid the multibillion-dollar consolidation in various sectors of the telecommunications industry, as companies of all size and description try to expand their geographic and technical reach.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, AT&amp;T won conditional approval from the Federal Communications Commission for its $58 billion acquisition of the MediaOne Group Inc., one of the nation's biggest cable television companies. And less than two weeks later Bell Atlantic won the F.C.C.'s conditional approval of the company's $53 billion acquisition of the GTE Corporation, a deal that will create the nation's biggest phone company. In both cases, the Justice Department had already signed off on the mergers, provided that certain conditions were met.</p>
        <p>One merger still pending antitrust and regulatory review is America Online Inc.'s proposed $165 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc. That deal would create the biggest company in both traditional and electronic media.</p>
        <p>But the America Online-Time Warner deal could have an easier time with regulators than the WorldCom-Sprint merger, at least on antitrust grounds. Because WorldCom and Sprint currently compete in many of the same markets, their merger appears much more vulnerable to a traditional antitrust challenge than the deal between America Online and Time Warner, which are not significant competitors in any of their far-flung operations.</p>
        <p>Antitrust regulators traditionally consider whether a merger would reduce competition and, as a result, limit customer choices. In its filing with the United States District Court in Washington, the Justice Department made just such an argument, saying that a Sprint-WorldCom merger would reduce competition in markets where the two companies are currently rivals.</p>
        <p>''This merger threatens to undermine the competitive gains achieved since the department challenged AT&amp;T's monopoly 25 years ago,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said in a statement yesterday. ''It is critical to our economy that we preserve competition for services that many of us rely upon in our everyday lives -- long-distance calls, data network services and Internet connections.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference, Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said that his main concern about the WorldCom-Sprint deal was that it would reduce the number of major competitors in the long-distance market from three to two.</p>
        <p>WorldCom acquired the MCI Communications Corporation in 1998 and still uses the MCI brand for some products. AT&amp;T controls roughly half of the $80 billion long-distance business while WorldCom currently controls about 20 percent and Sprint about 8 percent.</p>
        <p>''The difference between two and three bidders can be very, very significant,'' Mr. Klein said in an interview. ''They're both on the tube and in telemarketing to compete for your business. When you take one of them out, most consumers are aware, that restricts your options,''</p>
        <p>Similar considerations would probably not apply in the America Online-Time Warner deal, because the companies generally do not compete in the same markets. The exception is areas where Time Warner's Roadrunner cable modem Internet-access service competes against America Online's Internet service over telephone lines.</p>
        <p>''Sprint-WorldCom is irrelevant to AOL-Time Warner,'' said Scott Cleland, a regulatory analyst in Washington for the Precursor Group, an independent research firm. ''WorldCom-Sprint is a very different sort of merger in that it is a straight horizontal merger, and AOL-Time Warner is a vertical merger. The horizontal mergers have a lot of precedents and very clear guidelines. Vertical mergers have very few guidelines and few standards so it's much more an unknown.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cleland said the closer comparison for AOL-Time Warner would be the AT&amp;T-MediaOne deal that the government has already approved.  That comparison is cold comfort for WorldCom.</p>
        <p>People close to WorldCom and Sprint had said last week that the two companies were considering big concessions -- including a complete spinoff of Sprint's long-distance telephone business and Internet operation -- to appease antitrust regulators. But in the end, the concession offer never came, those people said, because the Justice Department wanted the companies to also agree to a spinoff of Sprint's local phone business. WorldCom was reluctant to agree, while Sprint was adamantly opposed, they said. Mr. Klein refused to discuss details of his negotiations with the two companies.</p>
        <p>WorldCom could consider some concessions because its main goal in acquiring Sprint was to gain control of Sprint's extensive wireless telephone network -- a business in which WorldCom has a neglible presence.</p>
        <p>In a terse statement yesterday, WorldCom said: ''WorldCom was advised today that the U.S. Department of Justice intends to file suit to block WorldCom's proposed merger with Sprint. WorldCom will promptly review its options with Sprint.''</p>
        <p>J. Richard Devlin, Sprint's general counsel, said in a statement: ''We are disappointed that we have been unable to convince the Justice Department that the merger is in the best interest of the American public and would advance competition. Over the next several days we will determine our next steps.''</p>
        <p>Investors yesterday were already trying to handicap the companies' next moves. If WorldCom and Sprint do in fact tear up their deal, WorldCom will still lack a wireless operation and will probably still seek one.</p>
        <p>The most likely candidates are Nextel Communications Inc., based in Reston, Va., and the VoiceStream Wireless Corporation, based in Bellevue, Wash. Shares of both companies rose yesterday on speculation that either could become the next potential target for WorldCom. Nextel stock rose by $1.4375, to $60.625, while shares of VoiceStream closed at $126, up $4.875 in Nasdaq trading.</p>
        <p>If Sprint remains single, its most likely consolidation partners appear to be the BellSouth Corporation and Deutsche Telekom of Germany. BellSouth, the only one of the seven original Baby Bell local phone companies  that has not yet participated in a major merger, lost a bidding war for Sprint with WorldCom last year.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom, meanwhile, has long cast about for entree to the United States market and until last year was a partner with Sprint in an international venture called Global One. Each of those companies, however, could face serious regulatory or legal hurdles.</p>
        <p>BellSouth, as one of the regional Bell companies that emerged from the breakup of the old American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company in 1984, is currently not allowed to sell long-distance communications services to customers in its core Southeastern region. Long-distance, of course, is Sprint's main business.</p>
        <p>Under current laws and regulations, Deutsche Telekom, Germany's main phone company, would probably face few serious hurdles to acquiring Sprint. But yesterday, Senator Ernest Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, introduced a bill that could block such a deal.</p>
        <p>''All American companies are vulnerable to takeover, and we want full control,'' the senator said.</p>
        <p>Under the Hollings bill, companies in which foreign governments own a stake of 25 percent or more would not be allowed to acquire United States communications companies. The German government owns 58 percent of Deutsche Telekom.</p>
