        <p>The young women will pine for the maid service and the two meals a day, and some will even miss the fact that suitors were not allowed in their rooms, only in the elegantly appointed ''beau parlors.''</p>
        <p>But most of all, in this market of cloud-scaling housing costs, they will miss the rent: $600 to $700 a month, breakfast and dinner and maid service included.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Katharine House and Roberts House -- Manhattan's last two residential hotels for young women -- will be vacant, except for staff members who have until July 14 to leave. The closing of the residences will end an era when dozens of long-term hotels housed dewy-eyed women from all over the world. The most famous was the Barbizon Hotel for Women, which became a spa in 1988.</p>
        <p>The young residents of these hotels were an ambitious lot: aspiring models, actresses, dancers, writers and students. They had come to take on New York, hunting fame and fortune and, yes, husbands.</p>
        <p>Not just anyone could stay at these residences. At Roberts House, at 151 East 36th Street in Murray Hill, and Katharine House, at 118 West 13th Street in Greenwich Village, the women had to be between 18 and 25 years old and could not earn more than $25,000 a year.</p>
        <p>''It's a great entree into the city,'' said George Liu, one of the 25 to 30 young women at Roberts House who were still looking for new places to live last week. ''It's a great place to start. We've made great friends.''</p>
        <p>This week, Ms. Liu found a room on the Upper West Side. By yesterday, the 14 women remaining at Roberts House and the 13 at Katharine House were packing, some of them to return home, others to stay with friends.</p>
        <p>The two houses, each more than 70 years old and with 80 rooms, are owned by the Ladies Christian Union, a nonprofit organization founded before the Civil War. The organization has listed the buildings with Sotheby's International Realty Company, which estimates they will fetch just under $10 million each.</p>
        <p>Yeshiva University is seriously interested in Roberts House as a women's dormitory, said Dolly Lenz, executive vice president of Sotheby's. And Katharine House has caught the eye of a developer who wants to turn it into a condominium.</p>
        <p>The Ladies Christian Union once ran six such residences for women. ''Our goal is to promote the temporal, moral and religious welfare of women -- particularly young women -- who are dependent upon their own exertions for support,'' said Noelle Mills Adler, the organization's president.</p>
        <p>That mission has not changed, Mrs. Adler said, but the group's methods will. ''We feel there are more effective ways of fulfilling our purpose and reaching more needy young women by becoming a grant-making organization,'' she said, adding that the group would contribute to hardship cases at colleges, universities and performing arts and vocational schools.</p>
        <p>But the young women who have yet to find a new place to live in New York, or who have all but given up trying, are skeptical. ''I think they're sort of selling out,'' said Bonnie Freestone, a 23-year-old teacher at a Roman Catholic high school on the Upper East Side and a resident of Katharine House for more than a year. ''This is the last bit of affordable housing in the West Village, and now it's gone.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Freestone, who plans to go to graduate school in New Jersey after Katharine House closes, said that certain rules at the residence were a bit anachronistic. For example, she laughed when showing a visitor the beau parlor, a chintz-filled room with  flowers, and laughed again when asked if any men might have found their way into the women's rooms without the knowledge of the resident director, who functions in many ways like a dorm mother.</p>
        <p>''This place isn't even in the 20th century,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But that Victorian ethos comforted the parents of the young women from far-flung places who moved into the residences. At both houses, visitors are not allowed above the first floor without permission. At Katharine House receptionists buzz the young women in their rooms -- twice for a guest and once for a phone call. (The rooms at Roberts House have telephones.) At both buildings, the rules required suitors to leave by 11 p.m.</p>
        <p>Until the 1950's, there was even a curfew for residents: 11 p.m. on weekdays, midnight on weekends. ''There was a Salvation Army residence on 38th Street, and the girls who didn't meet the curfew used to go around there and spend the night,'' Mrs. Adler said. ''Well, the Salvation Army complained so bitterly, we dropped the curfew.''</p>
        <p>Melissa Mae Crawford, a 21-year-old resident of Roberts House and an aspiring artist, recalled that when her boyfriend came to install a stereo system in her room, a chaperon came, too.</p>
        <p>Ms. Crawford, a native of Lake Charles, La., recently found an apartment in Astoria to share with two other women. But the landlord has not finished renovating the place, ''so for two months we will be homeless,'' she said, glumly.</p>
        <p>Barbara Dawe, a dancer, has been looking for rooms in other long-term Manhattan hotels, a few of which started out as residences for young women but have since opened their doors to men and older women. Those moves changed the character of the residences. But that is not her chief concern.</p>
        <p>''They just don't seem to be as clean as this place,'' Ms. Dawe said last week as she ate a chili sandwich in the dining room of Roberts House. ''They just don't seem to be as nice, and they're more expensive. Here there are no ants, no roaches, no rats.''</p>
        <p>Staff members have been looking for new jobs, and in some cases, homes too. Alexandra Polychronopoulou, a residence co-director at Roberts House for the last four years, said that she would have to give up her own one-bedroom apartment there. Some days, she recalled, she could hear the sound of music coming from the baby grand piano in the living room whenever the women decided to throw an impromptu concert. Her eyes sparkled at the memory.</p>
        <p>''On many days, there were French girls eating in the garden, just chirping away,'' she said. ''In the winter, the girls would have hot chocolate, in their pajamas. And we would have the biggest Christmas tree and menorah.''</p>
        <p>Few residents or employees have been feeling festive lately.</p>
        <p>''I haven't reached the weeping stage yet,'' said Nikki Hinds, 25, a resident of Katharine House for a year and a half. ''But I've heard lots of weeping.'' Ms. Hinds, a part-time research assistant who has just completed a graduate program in public policy at New School University, is searching for an apartment with a friend. So far, they have come up empty-handed.</p>
        <p>Both buildings had been fully occupied until it was announced six months ago that they were being sold. ''A lot of girls just gave up and went back home,'' Ms. Hinds said.</p>
        <p>Dina Vickermann, a 21-year-old from Germany who came to study acting at the Lee Strasberg Institute, planned to do just that. Ms. Vickermann, who has lived at Roberts House for six months, said last week that she would return to Germany to study medicine. ''I'd like to try acting, but I need something where I can support myself,'' she said.</p>
        <p>And Becky Peterson, a 24-year-old editorial assistant at a publishing company, plans to leave Manhattan and live with relatives in the San Francisco Bay area after Katharine House closes. She has dreams of being a writer. ''I can't afford to live here anymore,'' she said. ''If I can't live in Manhattan, then I don't want to be here. Getting a share with someone in the outer boroughs is not what I came here for.''</p>
