        <p>WHEN a politician anywhere in America wants to build a stadium, it is customary to make a pilgrimage here to Oriole Park at Camden Yards. New York City officials have already performed the ritual twice. In 1998 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani came to watch the Yankees play and personally inspected the luxury sky boxes.</p>
        <p>''This is an enormously, an enormously successful project,'' Mr. Giuliani said then.  ''When you look at the development that it's helped in part to energize, it really is quite impressive.''</p>
        <p>Yes, the development on the nearby waterfront is impressive: sold-out hotels, bustling stores and restaurants, promenades crowded with tourists. But politicians might get a truer picture if they came when the Orioles are out of town, like this last week in June. The crowds are still here. The hotels routinely sell out on summer weekends even when there is no game.</p>
        <p>The crowds were here long before the stadium opened in 1992. This week the city is celebrating the 20th anniversary of Harborplace, the complex of stores and food stands dedicated to what urban planners call ''recreational shopping.'' It was Harborplace, plus a new aquarium and other tourist attractions, that revived the waterfront. The Orioles play only 81 games per year, but recreational shopping never stops.</p>
        <p>Maryland taxpayers spent $200 million on Oriole Park, and $210 million more for the adjacent football stadium, which opened in 1998. New York officials have been contemplating both kinds of stadiums for the West Side of Manhattan, at a cost of $1 billion each.</p>
        <p>Politicians in New York envision hotels springing up next to a stadium, but that's not happening in Baltimore. There are still warehouses near the Ravens' football stadium. A new hotel is being built, but it's across the harbor -- far from the stadiums but close to stores and tourist attractions.</p>
        <p>Oriole Park is a financial success story if you compare it with the football stadium, or with almost any other new stadium. (Cleveland's baseball stadium is the other one held up as a model.) But even it is a money-losing proposition, according to a study by two economists at Johns Hopkins University, Bruce W. Hamilton and Peter Kahn.</p>
        <p>''If you're getting more people in the ballpark, you're taking them away from bars and and bowling alleys and places like that,'' Dr. Hamilton said. Nationally, new stadiums hurt the economy by diverting investment from more productive enterprises. Locally, they make sense only by attracting money from out-of-towners.</p>
        <p>''New York City, like Baltimore, can draw people from nearby jurisdictions,'' Dr. Hamilton said. ''You can rip off people from New Jersey just like we can try to rip off people from Washington. The problem is that they're not going to bring in enough money from New Jersey to justify spending a billion dollars on a stadium.''</p>
        <p>ATTENDANCE at the Orioles' games rose after they moved to Camden Yards, with about 70 percent of the new revenue coming from out of state. The result, according to the Hopkins study, has been new jobs and tax revenues worth about $3 million annually, which is $11 million less than what the stadium costs taxpayers. That works out to a loss of about $15 annually for each household in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>For Baltimoreans, that may seem a small price to pay for a source of entertainment, pride and civic unity. ''If there had been a referendum,'' Dr. Hamilton said, ''asking people in the Baltimore area if they were willing to pay $15 a household to keep the Orioles from leaving, I think it would have passed.'' Voters would have assumed that the stadium was essential to keep the Orioles from fleeing to a better deal elsewhere in the country.</p>
        <p>But fans in the New York area don't have to worry much about their teams' heading to an upstart city in the Sun Belt. The teams are already in the biggest and most lucrative market in the country. A team can cross the Hudson in search of a better deal without leaving that market, but any move out of the metropolitan area could be financially disastrous.</p>
        <p>''New York has much more bargaining power than Baltimore,'' Dr. Hamilton said. ''Its baseball and football teams are not going to a smaller city somewhere else. It would be more sensible for New York to forge an agreement with New Jersey not to bid against each other. Instead of paying a billion dollars for a new stadium for the Yankees, New York might pay New Jersey a much smaller amount to keep them from trying to steal the Yankees.''</p>
