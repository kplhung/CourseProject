        <p>Offering a sweeping vision of a future in which pollution is conquered and cars run without a ''drop of oil or gasoline,'' Vice President Al Gore proposed tax breaks and other incentives today for both reducing America's dependence on oil and cleaning up the environment.</p>
        <p>And he made clear that he wanted to claim these issues in the presidential election not only with his soaring oratory but with the amount of money that he was willing to devote to them, more than $125 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>The plans that the vice president outlined today -- mostly various forms of tax breaks for businesses that provided or invested in more efficient, less conventional or less polluting sources of energy -- represented an estimated $75 billion in lost federal tax revenue or spending over 10 years, aides said. But they said that the additional proposals that Mr. Gore was expected to make on Wednesday and Thursday would bring that figure up to more than $125 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore framed that investment as both an opportunity and an obligation created by the country's current period of extraordinary prosperity.</p>
        <p>''There can be a next stage of prosperity in which American creativity builds not just a better product but also a healthier planet,'' Mr. Gore said outside an energy plant here that was a model for the use of newer, cleaner, more efficient technology.</p>
        <p>''We will say to the nation's inventors and entrepreneurs: if you invest in these new technologies, America will invest in you,'' Mr. Gore continued. ''And we will prove, once and for all, that we can clean up pollution, make our power systems more efficient and more reliable, and move away from dependence on others all with no new taxes, no new bureaucracies, and no onerous regulations.''</p>
        <p>While economists and business executives often worry that more clean-air efforts and stringent environmental regulations would hamper industry and limit the creation of new jobs, Mr. Gore's approach emphasized the carrot of tax savings rather than the stick of restrictions, and it anticipated the growth of new companies and new jobs on the cutting edge of fuel technology.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore's pitch was more than just an exhortation for a cleaner environment. It also reflected the sudden emergence of high gasoline prices as a potent issue in the 2000 presidential elections. Republicans have assailed the Clinton administration for an energy policy that they say has left the country too vulnerable to the whims of foreign oil producers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore even folded into his speech a call for the Federal Trade Commission's investigation into possible price-gouging by the oil industry to include public hearings, possibly with testimony from consumers.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, when Mr. Gore embarked on what he called a ''prosperity and progress'' tour, he said he would spend this week talking about environmental policy. But since then, gas prices have become an increasingly heated point of contention between Republicans and Democrats, and today, the word energy accompanied and even preceded the word environment in the headlines atop the written remarks and policy summaries that Mr. Gore's aides distributed to reporters.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Gore frequently alluded in his 26-minute address to the problems of American dependence on ''big oil,'' a phrase undoubtedly meant as a dig against his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a former oil company executive. Democrats have said that Mr. Bush's former professional ties and the enormous sums of campaign money he has received from oil companies would make him unwilling to press for lower prices at the gas pump.</p>
        <p>In any case, Mr. Gore said in his speech, ''Our next-stage prosperity must be built on our ability to make sure Americans will be free forever from the dominance of big oil and foreign oil.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said that America today stood ''on a new frontier of energy independence and environmental protection'' and should not fail to explore it. ''It is an old, timid way of thinking to build our lives and livelihoods around a fuel source that is distant, uncertain and easily manipulated,'' he said. ''It is a new, bold way of thinking to demand and develop new technologies to free ourselves from gas-tank price-gouging.''</p>
        <p>Later, in a satellite interview with an ABC affiliate in Green Bay, Wis., Mr. Gore attacked Mr. Bush more directly.</p>
        <p>''I have never been afraid to take on big oil,'' Mr. Gore said. But, the vice president added, ''My opponent comes out of the oil industry. His experience is as an oil company executive. He called for higher oil prices to boost the oil companies' profits.''</p>
        <p>Officials with the Bush campaign noted that Mr. Bush had endorsed the Federal Trade Commission's investigation into oil companies and said that Mr. Gore was merely trying to deflect attention from the Clinton administration's responsibility for gas prices that have risen as much as 50 cents a gallon in some areas of the Midwest. Mr. Gore, as it happens, will be taking his new energy message to that region over the next few days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides further said that what Mr. Gore unveiled today was really a set of environmental proposals, none of them especially visionary, that were recast and reconfigured to sound like an energy plan because the political landscape had changed so quickly.</p>
        <p>''The vice president seems to forget who's been in office for seven years,'' Mr. Bush said at a news conference in Michigan this afternoon. ''This is an administration that's been in charge and the price of gasoline has risen steadily.''</p>
        <p>The plan that Mr. Gore began to outline today centered on an unspecified ''menu of financial mechanisms,'' as material distributed by his aides called it, of tax incentives, loans, grants and bonds to help ''power plants and industries that come forward with projects that promise to dramatically reduce climate and health-threatening pollution.''</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Gore's proposals represented expansions of current federal programs, while others were new. They included doubling the tax credit for businesses that turn wind or landfill methane into electricity and giving accelerated tax deductions to companies for the purchase of equipment that makes cleaner and more efficient use of fuel. In the coming days, Mr. Gore's aides said, the vice president will talk about tax breaks for consumers who use solar energy or buy products, like cars, that do not use traditional sources of fuel like oil.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's proposals seem to veer in somewhat different directions from those of the last Democratic president to offer a sweeping set of proposals on energy use, Jimmy Carter. As a way of trying to reduce dependence on foreign oil, Mr. Carter set import quotas on the amount of foreign oil accepted into American ports. And he encouraged the development of alternative sources of fuel, including coal, oil shale, unconventional gas and the sun. Mr. Carter asked that utility companies cut their use of oil by 50 percent over a decade, and switch to other fuels,  particularly coal.</p>
        <p>And most famously, he ordered thermostats turned down in the winter as a conservation measure and wore a sweater in the chilly White House.</p>
