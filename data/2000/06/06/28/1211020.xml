        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>ALBANY: FOSTER PARENT LAW -- The State Legislature has passed a bill allowing some felons to become foster and adoptive parents. The bill is expected to be signed by Gov. George E. Pataki, a spokesman for his office said. If it becomes law, it would overturn the current law, which requires fingerprinting of all foster and adoptive parents. If violent felonies are found in the parents' background, their children must be removed, even if caseworkers had determined that the children were safe. Two State Family Court judges have already ruled the provision unconstitutional, and advocates for foster parents and children and city child welfare officials want the law overturned.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: MONEY LAUNDERING RING -- Federal prosecutors in Manhattan and Brooklyn yesterday charged 17 people, including nine city employees, with conspiracy to launder money. The authorities said repeated cash deposits of just less than $10,000 were made to avoid federal laws that require banks to report large cash deposits to the Internal Revenue Service. About $200,000 was seized from one defendant. The Department of Investigation said yesterday that the implicated city workers were not high-level employees and not in law enforcement.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: SEX ABUSE CHARGED -- In two separate incidents, four primary school students were arrested yesterday on charges of sexually abusing 9-year-old girls inside their Brooklyn schools, the police said. In the first incident, a girl was in a bathroom at Public School 56 on Gates Avenue in the Clinton Hill section when two other 9-year-old girls sexually abused her, said Detective Edward Reuss, a police spokesman. The attack happened on June 16 but was not reported to the police until yesterday, he said. In the second incident, which took place yesterday morning, two boys, 10 and 11, attacked a 9-year-old girl in the hallway of P.S. 25 on Lafayette Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Detective Reuss said. An investigator said the boys threw the girl to the ground and grabbed at her through her clothing.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: GUN CAMPAIGN -- Andrew M. Cuomo, left, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Eliot L. Spitzer, New York attorney general, yesterday urged New York City to join 400 other cities in a campaign of economic pressure on handgun manufacturers.</p>
        <p>The cities give preference in their police handgun purchases to Smith &amp; Wesson, the largest handgun producer and the only one that has agreed to install trigger locks and other safety features on its guns.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: JANITOR HUNGER STRIKE -- Eight janitors who work at a Brooklyn office tower began a hunger strike on Monday to protest the building owner's fight against their efforts to join the city's largest janitors' union, Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International Union.</p>
        <p>For six weeks, 31 janitors at the building, Brooklyn Renaissance Plaza, which is owned by Muss Development, have been on strike. They say many of them are paid less than half the $16 an hour earned by New York's unionized janitors.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: MORE MINORITIES STOPPED -- New data gathered by the state police show that more members of minorities are stopped by troopers on the New Jersey Turnpike than elsewhere in the state. The data, compiled under a consent decree in a recent racial profiling case, show that 38.3 percent of drivers stopped on the turnpike from January through April were members of minority groups, compared with 22.1 percent of drivers stopped by troopers in other places. Officials declined to comment on the data.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: TROOPERS OBJECT -- Lawyers for James Kenna and John Hogan, the state troopers who face trial on attempted murder and aggravated assault charges in the 1998 shooting of three minority men in a van on the New Jersey Turnpike, accused prosecutors of misleading and improperly influencing the grand jury to obtain indictments against the troopers. Judge Andrew J. Smithson of Superior Court said he would rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss the indictments on July 25.</p>
        <p>David M. Halbfinger (NYT)</p>
        <p>TRENTON: H.M.O. BAILOUT -- New Jersey's health maintenance organizations sued the state yesterday to overturn a law requiring them to pay $50 million in claims by doctors and hospitals against two H.M.O.'s that went bankrupt in 1998. The New Jersey Association of Health Plans filed the suit in Superior Court in Mercer County, asserting that their forced bailout of the companies, HIP Health Plan of New Jersey and American Preferred Provider Plan, was an unconstitutional taking of property. The Department of Banking and Insurance ordered the payment as part of a $100 million bailout plan.</p>
        <p>Steve Strunsky (NYT)</p>
        <p>TRENTON: BEACH FEES -- A senior Assembly Democrat yesterday called for constitutional amendments banning fees for New Jersey beaches and establishing a lottery to pay for beach maintenance. The assemblyman, Neil M. Cohen, Democrat of Elizabeth, introduced a bill last month to hold a referendum on the issue.</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>HARTFORD: LAWMAKERS CRITICIZED -- The Connecticut League of Conservation Voters yesterday criticized the Connecticut General Assembly, saying it did little about environmental legislation. The league said only one of nine bills it tracked passed. The failed bills included proposals to reduce solid waste and minimize power-plant pollution.</p>
