        <p>Conde Nast to close down Women's Sports &amp; Fitness magazine with September issue; EMAP Petersen announces it will cease publication of Sport magazine, general-interest monthly that has been published since 1946 (M)</p>

        <p>After less than four years of publication, Women's Sports &amp; Fitness, an enthusiast magazine for women that was perhaps best known for featuring the volleyball player Gabrielle Reece on its cover more times than any other magazine in the world -- will cease publication with the September issue.</p>
        <p>The move signals a continued trend toward watching the bottom line at Conde Nast, which publishes Women's Sports. In March, S. I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Conde Nast and its parent, Advance Publications, announced that he would temporarily shut Details magazine, a magazine for young men, and transfer it to Fairchild Publications, which Advance bought last summer, for a makeover.</p>

        <p>The move signals a continued trend toward watching the bottom line at Conde Nast, which publishes Women's Sports. In March, S. I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Conde Nast and its parent, Advance Publications, announced that he would temporarily shut Details magazine, a magazine for young men, and transfer it to Fairchild Publications, which Advance bought last summer, for a makeover.</p>
        <p>The demise of Women's Sports comes one day after EMAP Petersen announced that it would cease publication of Sport magazine, a general-interest monthly that has been published since 1946.</p>
        <p>From the first issue in 1997, Women's Sports &amp; Fitness ambled from one editorial identity to another. First titled Conde Nast Women's Sports &amp; Fitness, the magazine changed its name to Women's Sports &amp; Fitness in 1998. Its publication scheduled went from monthly to every other month and then back.</p>
        <p>The magazine recently raised its rate base -- the circulation guaranteed to advertisers -- to 650,000, but Conde Nast executives said the additional circulation was acquired through off-price subscription offers and was not reliable over the long term. Overall circulation grew 9.9 percent for the six months ended Dec. 31, 1999, but newsstand sales fell 3.9 percent in the same period, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.</p>
        <p>James Truman, Conde Nast's editorial director and the editor who conceived of the idea for a women's sports magazine, said that Women's Sports never found an audience.</p>
        <p>''We felt we were publishing a very good magazine, and we had been really holding on with it for a long time, 18 months,'' he said. ''We kept hoping the audience would materialize, but it did not.''</p>
        <p>Advertising pages were up -- by 41.9 percent through July to 346 pages, according to Mediaweek Magazine -- but not sufficiently. Advertisers never flocked to the title, citing its lack of focus. Lucy Schulte Danziger, the magazine's editor in chief, said yesterday that she would resign.</p>
