        <p>The Yankees were considered a great team the last time David Cone won a game, on April 28. They were feared. They were easy favorites to repeat as World Series champions.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch's throwing problems were dormant, the pitching rotation was deep, the lineup considered potent.</p>
        <p>But that was two months ago, two long months since Cone last won, and in the interim, the Yankees have become timid, injuries nagging at them, ragged and prone to mistakes. They are only three games over .500 after losing, 7-6 in 11 innings, to Detroit tonight, with the Tigers scoring the decisive run against an unusual defensive alignment.</p>
        <p>Over the last 40 games -- roughly a quarter of the season -- the Yankees are 15-25; projected over a full season, that translates to 100 losses. They are a team in need of a stimulant, an emotional comeback victory, a modest winning streak, the explosive return of someone like Roger Clemens, or perhaps a trade.</p>
        <p>Cone could have been the stimulant tonight, he admitted afterward. ''Tonight would've helped,'' he said, after allowing 11 hits and 6 runs in four and a third innings; he has not won any of his last 10 starts. ''The team needed me to step up and have a big game.''</p>
        <p>They presented him with an early lead, three runs in the fourth against Hideo Nomo. Tony Clark slugged a homer leading off the bottom of the inning, but Cone pitched out of further trouble. Through four innings, the Tigers were hitless in seven at-bats with runners in scoring position, a trend from Cone's most recent starts.</p>
        <p>The Yankees (37-34) had the bases loaded and one out in the fifth when Chris Turner hit a ground ball to second. After a forceout at second, shortstop Deivi Cruz threw to first. It was easy to see, from a distance, that Turner crossed first base before the ball arrived at the bag. Television replays confirmed that he had clearly beaten the throw, and the Yankees should have had another run. Except that Jeff Kellogg, the first-base umpire, called Turner out.</p>
        <p>Turner spun to the ground in disgust. Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, bumped through some irate players in his dugout and rushed onto the field, arguing at length before leaving the field. But the bench coach Don Zimmer yelled something and Kellogg ejected him, and Torre came out to resume the quarrel, challenging Kellogg until he was ejected. Zimmer hobbled out of the dugout and approached Kellogg, yelling and gesturing, while Torre tried to keep his body between Zimmer and the umpires. Cone had finished his warm-ups, and he waited. The arguing continued. Cone waited. Torre and Zimmer departed, and the bottom of the fifth inning began. Four Yankees have been ejected this season, all in the last eight days, as they have plummeted toward .500 and their frustration has grown.</p>
        <p>The Tigers ripped three consecutive hits, one run scoring. Cone struck out Juan Gonzalez on a slider, walked Clark to reload the bases and then hung a slider to Dean Palmer, who destroyed it, a grand slam. A quick collapse for Cone.</p>
        <p>''More of the same,'' he said, referring to his own performance. ''It's a familiar story line.''</p>
        <p>Cone was asked if the delay was a factor in his collapse. ''It shouldn't have been,'' he said. ''It's always frustrating when you have to wait for any delay. It's no excuse.''</p>
        <p>Cone walked off the mound with the Yankees trailing, 6-3, but his teammates tied the game, scoring twice in the seventh, once in the eighth.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to the 11th, after Jason Grimsley, Mike Stanton and Jeff Nelson combined to shut out the Tigers for five straight innings. Mariano Rivera jogged out of the bullpen to pitch the bottom of the 11th, and Bobby Higginson lined a single over shortstop. Nobody out.</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams made a sliding catch on a looping fly ball hit by Gonzalez, but when Shane Halter hit a ground ball to Derek Jeter -- with Higginson running on the pitch -- the grounder skipped off Jeter's glove and into short left field. Higginson sped into third. It was the 10th error of the season for Jeter, who made 9 errors in 1998, 14 last year.</p>
        <p>This error, Jeter said, was ''a huge mistake.'' The Tigers had runners on first and third and one out, and the right-handed-hitting Robert Fick was coming to bat. Almost uniformly, teams move their defenses in under these circumstances, to try to cut off the winning run at the plate.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' middle infielders were back, playing for a double play. It was unusual for another reason: Rivera breaks so many bats with his fastball that even when there are no runners on base, the Yankees' infielders will come in a step or two. Torre said afterward that he was managing the team after he was ejected, ''doing a lot of 50-yard dashes.''</p>
        <p>Fick dribbled a slow roller toward Jeter, who had to rush in several steps before fielding and throwing home, the ball reaching the catcher, Turner, almost at the same time as Higginson. But Higginson never stepped on home and Turner dropped the ball, and it took both players an instant to realize that the home-plate umpire had not made a call.</p>
        <p>Higginson jabbed a foot at the plate, just ahead of Turner's lunge, and the game was over, on the 60th day since Cone's last victory.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Yankees received good news on all the players coping with nagging injuries. ORLANDO HERNANDEZ threw for 15 minutes off a mound here and if his elbow feels all right, he could be plugged back into the rotation for the weekend series in Tampa Bay. ROGER CLEMENS threw 60 pitches in a bullpen workout in Tampa, Fla., Tuesday and will throw batting practice to hitters Thursday. If he comes through that in good shape, he could rejoin the Yankees' rotation sometime next week. SCOTT BROSIUS, the third baseman, could have played Tuesday, but was given the day off to rest his right hamstring, which caused him to leave Sunday's game. RAMIRO MENDOZA, who has felt stiffness in his shoulder, will play catch, and if he feels all right, he could maintain his place in the rotation. But Mendoza's wife is expecting a baby any day, and he might have to leave the team.</p>
        <p>One day after the Yankees prospects ALFONSO SORIANO, TED LILLY and JACKSON MELIAN were all scratched from lineups in minor league games -- fueling speculation that a deal for SAMMY SOSA was imminent -- all were available to play Tuesday night. Soriano is working out at second base, but contrary to an earlier report, the Yankees don't intend to promote him right away and use CHUCK KNOBLAUCH as a designated hitter.</p>
