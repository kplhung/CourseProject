        <p>House Republican leaders agreed today to end four decades of sanctions on sales of food to Cuba, in a decision that carried great political significance.</p>
        <p>But the economic value is relatively minor, as Cuban-American lawmakers managed to place severe restrictions in the bill.</p>
        <p>The deal would in principle allow American farmers and agricultural businesses to sell their goods directly to Cuba for the first time since 1962. The agreement also echoes existing policy allowing the sale of medicine.</p>
        <p>But the federal government and American banks would be barred from providing any financing for Cuba, making it difficult for Cuba, with little cash, to buy goods.</p>
        <p>In addition, the trade would be one-way: Cuba would not be permitted to export to the United States.</p>
        <p>The Senate has already approved a more expansive version of the legislation as part of its agriculture spending bill. The House and Senate must now resolve their differences, but the more stringent House language is expected to win approval. If not, the deal among House Republican leaders will probably fall apart.</p>
        <p>The full House and Senate could take up the bill in the coming weeks as part of a larger spending package. That means there would be no vote specifically on lifting the Cuba sanctions, only on the larger bill.</p>
        <p>The bill would also lift unilateral food and medicine sanctions against Libya, Sudan, North Korea and Iran. Under the bill, Iran would also be ineligible for private financing from American banks.</p>
        <p>The House Republican leaders reached their agreement early this morning after nearly six hours of negotiations.</p>
        <p>House Republican leaders long opposed any weakening of the embargo against Cuba, which is meant to put pressure on President Fidel Castro. But an intense lobbying campaign by agribusiness and recent action by Congress and the Clinton administration to ease trade restrictions on other nations, including China and North Korea, helped soften the Republican opposition this year.</p>
        <p>Even so, the White House expressed reservations about the deal, mostly because it would require the president to get Congress to approve the imposing of future sanctions on sales of food and medicine to other countries. That has been a presidential prerogative.</p>
        <p>Representative George W. Nethercutt, the Washington Republican who championed the bill, described the agreement as a ''fundamental shift in American foreign policy.''</p>
        <p>Doing business with Cuba, he said, is ''not as easy as it would otherwise be'' because of the restrictions. ''But the door is open and that's what's important.''</p>
        <p>Representatives Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Florida Republicans, said they viewed the agreement as a symbolic matter that benefited their agenda as well. For instance, the bill would turn existing federal restrictions on tourism into law. Currently, federal rules specify who can travel to Cuba, with cultural and religious groups among them.</p>
        <p>That provision brought a round of criticism from House and Senate Democrats.</p>
        <p>The Republican proposal ''not only does too little to insure that U.S. food and medicine will reach the Cuban people,'' said Representative Sam Gejdenson, a Connecticut Democrat, in a typical comment. ''It also will unnecessarily interfere with critical people-to-people contacts.''</p>
        <p>The reaction from Cuba was negative. The president of the National Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon, said the bill contained ''unacceptable discriminatory conditions.''</p>
        <p>The bill is silent on existing law that complicates the transport of farm goods to Cuba. Under a 1992 law, any ship that visits Cuba, whether registered in the United States or a foreign country, is barred from calling at any United States port for six months, and most analysts agreed this adds another obstacle to the deal.</p>
        <p>The limitation ''makes it less attractive commercially,'' said Wally Workman, vice president of international affairs for the United States Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>Still, agricultural and business groups, as well as academic experts, said the bill could be the first chink in the armor of American sanctions to clear Congress.</p>
        <p>''The main thing that it means politically is that this is the first time that the U.S. Congress has taken a decision to open up economic sanctions with Cuba, I think ever,'' said Jorge Dominguez, a professor of government at Harvard University.</p>
        <p>For the House Republican leadership, the agreement was a political calculation. Mr. Nethercutt faces a tough re-election bid in a swing district and, with a slim Republican majority in the House, leaders did not want to defeat him on his signature issue and anger his constituents. Neither did they want to anger Cuban-Americans.</p>
        <p>The Elian Gonzalez saga also played into Congressional sensibilities this year after the boy's plight prompted a widespread discussion of America's policy toward Cuba.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said today at a news conference in Wayne, Mich., that he continued to oppose the legislation, saying no softening in sanctions are warranted until Mr. Castro puts an end to human rights violations.</p>
        <p>''I have opposed lifting the sanctions, and I still continue to do so,'' Mr. Bush said. He expressed skepticism that Mr. Castro would let food reach his people, and added, ''I like to remind people this is a man who is tyrannical.''</p>
        <p>Aides for Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, said Mr. Gore took issue with the bill's interference with a president's right to issue sanctions.</p>
        <p>The biggest beneficiaries of the bill would be large agricultural companies, which have lobbied Congress for years to lift the embargo.</p>
        <p>They are best equipped to help obtain loans for Cuba from foreign banks. But unlike Iran, with its oil, Cuba has no hard currency exports to speak of.</p>
        <p>Cuba withdrew from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the 1960's and so is barred from any financing from them.</p>
        <p>Cuba buys from countries like France, China and Canada, whose governments heavily subsidize the sales.</p>
        <p>The American Farm Bureau calculates that Cuba spends $1 billion a year on agricultural products.</p>
        <p>In the next 12 months, American farmers stand to make sales to Cuba of $25 million to $45 million, according to an estimate by the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a center financed by businesses.</p>
        <p>The Cuban-American National Foundation, the leading anti-Castro lobby, said it would fight the bill.</p>
