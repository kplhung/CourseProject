        <p>The state lobbying commission assessed $133,600 in fines today, quadruple what it levied in all of 1998, in a sign that a new lobbying law and a get-tough attitude by the commission are affecting a culture of lax compliance with disclosure rules.</p>
        <p>The Temporary State Commission on Lobbying fined 37 organizations, including the New York Yankees, New School University, the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young, Polytechnic University of Brooklyn, the unions representing New York City's police detectives and paramedics, and various less famous transgressors -- all for failure to meet filing deadlines.</p>
        <p>Lobbyists and their clients are required to disclose lobbying income and expenses every three months. But under the old law, a missed deadline brought nothing more than a warning, followed by a grace period in which the report could be filed late without penalty.</p>
        <p>The new law, adopted in December, eliminates the grace period and allows fines up to $25,000 for violations of the disclosure rules, up from a maximum of $5,000 under the old law.</p>
        <p>Last year, it was revealed that the chief lobbyist here for Philip Morris, the world's largest tobacco company, had failed to disclose dinners, tickets to events and other gifts to legislators and other state officials, and had falsified many of her lobbying reports.</p>
        <p>After those disclosures, the commission -- which, despite its name, has existed since the 1970's -- began flexing its muscles. In November, it assessed fines of $75,000 against Philip Morris and $15,000 against its lobbyist, Sharon T. Portnoy, for repeated violations of the law. No person, company or firm had ever been fined more than $5,000 in a single case.</p>
        <p>This year, the commission fined Microsoft $30,000 for filing a report that misstated who had attended a dinner it gave at a Manhattan restaurant for city and state officials.</p>
        <p>Today's fines were meted out against one lobbyist and 37 lobbying clients for failure to file year-end reports on 1999 lobbying by Jan. 15.  The commission held a public hearing on the late reports last week, then held a closed meeting to set the fines, which ranged from $1,500 to $5,000. Officials at the commission declined to explain the differing amounts.</p>
        <p>In a written statement, the commission said that in addition to the fines, it had already charged fees of up to $25 for each day a report was late.</p>
        <p>The commission assessed $21,900 in fines for all of 1997. In 1998, the figure rose to $33,300. In 1999, it jumped to $103,750, but $90,000 of that was the Philip Morris case.</p>
        <p>So far, this year, the commission has levied $183,600 in fines, almost half of it for late filings.</p>
        <p>''The year's only half over,'' said David M. Grandeau, executive director of the commission. ''I'm sure there will be more.''</p>
