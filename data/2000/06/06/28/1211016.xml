        <p>The Sammy Sosa trade talks envelop the Yankees like a fog that won't go away. But the president of the Cubs wants the discussions settled, one way or the other. And the Yankee manager, Joe Torre, has suggested to club executives that for the good of the team, they should make a deal or move on.</p>
        <p>With pressure for a resolution mounting from both sides, Sosa could be a Yankee within 24 hours, in a trade of five to seven prospects for Sosa and pitcher Ismael Valdes. Or the Yanks might make another deal, perhaps with the Oakland Athletics, Pittsburgh Pirates or Baltimore Orioles. Or, they might do nothing.</p>
        <p>''There's no reason for this thing to be prolonged any further,'' Andy MacPhail, the Cubs' president, said in a telephone interview tonight. ''I will push for this to come to a resolution one way or another shortly. It's not that hard. We can agree, or we can agree to disagree.''</p>
        <p>Torre said, ''Make it happen, or make it go away.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees and the Cubs are on the verge of settling on a trade that would send a stable of prospects -- shortstop Alfonso Soriano, infielder D'Angelo Jimenez, pitchers Jake Westbrook and Alex Graman, outfielder Jackson Melian and outfielder Ricky Ledee are among those being discussed -- to Chicago for Sosa and Valdes, a right-handed pitcher who would presumably join the Yankees' rotation. Once the two sides reach an agreement on players, then the Yankees would presumably receive a 72-hour window within which to negotiate a contract with Sosa and to persuade him to waive his right to veto the trade.</p>
        <p>Both sides understand now where the middle ground is. They both understand what it will take to complete a deal. But while the Yankees continue to talk to the Cubs -- one Yankee official indicated that the Cubs are pushing to complete the deal -- New York is evaluating the implications of the huge commitment in money and prospects the trade would entail.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, whose farm teams are solid but not teeming with prospects, would bite deep into their system and swap a handful of young players who could help them, while earning low salaries, in the years to come. In return, they would receive Valdes, a talented but erratic pitcher whose fortitude has been repeatedly questioned, and a high-impact offensive player who could contribute lots of home runs, lots and lots of strikeouts and phenomenal marquee value.</p>
        <p>The Yankees could go in another direction. They have had discussions with the Oakland Athletics about acquiring an offensive player, possibly John Jaha or Matt Stairs; Oakland covets Soriano and Shane Spencer.</p>
        <p>The Pirates represent a more modest deal that would bring the Yankees a pitcher and a hitter -- either Francisco Cordova or Jose Silva, both right-handed pitchers, paired with either the proven hitter Wil Cordero or the veteran John Vander Wal. The Yankees also spoke with the Baltimore Orioles today about the availability of the right-hander Scott Erickson, and continued discussions about the left-handed-hitting outfielder B. J. Surhoff; these talks are not yet serious.</p>
        <p>Talks regarding Houston's Moises Alou are all but destined to fail; Alou has a no-trade provision in his contract and doesn't want to be dealt.</p>
        <p>What the Yankees must decide is whether they are ready to take the Sosa leap; it's the bungee jump of their trade options.</p>
        <p>Everybody involved, from executives to players, want the Yankees to jump quickly, or back off quickly. Bernie Williams, the Yankees' center fielder and the team's leader, believes the trade talks have weighed on the team, which has lost 24 of its last 39 games. ''You see a guy trying to press, like it's their last game,'' Williams said. ''Everybody's wondering what's going to happen. Even if it takes away only 5 percent of our attention, or 10 percent, it's still a distraction.''</p>
        <p>Williams didn't mention Ledee's name directly, but he might as well have. Ledee has been on edge since spring training, when his name was part of the Jim Edmonds trade talks, and particularly since May, when George Steinbrenner wondered aloud whether Ledee was tough enough to play in New York.</p>
        <p>Ledee learned last Thursday that he was part of the conditional Juan Gonzalez deal with Detroit, and for four days, he waited to see if Gonzalez would reach a contract agreement with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Monday night, Ledee flipped on his computer in the Atheneum hotel in downtown Detroit, and the first headline he saw said that Gonzalez had turned down a one-year offer from the Yankees. Ledee signed on to the Yankees' Web site, and he read as fans batted his name back and forth in trade rumors, for Sosa, for Cordero. He turned the computer off well past midnight.</p>
