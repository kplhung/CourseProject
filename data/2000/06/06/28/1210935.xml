        <p>The Japanese government said today that it would sell the bankrupt Tokyo Sowa Bank to an investment fund led by Wilbur L. Ross, a specialist in corporate rescues who has made a name for himself through investing in financially distressed companies in the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross's fund, the Asia Recovery Fund, will pay 35 billion yen, or about $331 million at current exchange rates, for Tokyo Sowa, the second Japanese bank it has bought. Last month, the government sold the failed Kofuku Bank, which operates mainly in Osaka, to the fund.</p>
        <p>Tokyo Sowa is the third bank the government has sold to foreigners and the sixth nationalized bank it has returned to the private sector since it began overhauling the country's shaky financial system two years ago. By the time it hands Tokyo Sowa over to Mr. Ross, the government will have spent 70 billion yen, or about $673 million, cleaning it up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross has been one of the most serious foreign investors in Asia since the financial crisis that gripped much of the region in 1997.</p>
        <p>A bankruptcy specialist in the United States, he has promoted the idea of vulture investing here, or buying distressed businesses that can be salvaged for profit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross says he sees great opportunities in the Japanese banking industry, which has been riddled with bad loans as a legacy of the speculative-bubble economy of the 1980's.</p>
        <p>By melding the two troubled Japanese banks he is buying, Mr. Ross plans to create a network of 200 branches offering services to individuals and small and midsize companies in and around Tokyo and Osaka, Japan's two largest cities. ''This will give us critical mass, making critical investments in information technology and marketing more affordable,'' Mr. Ross said.</p>
        <p>Tokyo Sowa is smaller than Kofuku but has several strengths that Mr. Ross hopes will enhance the investment. The Tokyo bank is known for having one of the best automated teller machine networks in Japan, distinguishing itself by offering a broad range of 24-hour services, still relatively rare here. It also issues credit cards, a business that Kofuku abandoned but would now like to re-enter. ''We now will have a big distribution system through which we can offer money management, insurance and other products that generate fees,'' Mr. Ross said. ''Increasing sales of fee-based products is key for Japanese banks. Interest rates are too low here to make a good rate of return with your balance sheet alone.''</p>
        <p>Japanese interest rates have been near zero for more than a year because of Japan's weak economy. The low rates have helped banks by keeping their own borrowing costs down. But the low rates also mean the banks have little reason to loan more money out and must find other ways to be profitable. Mr. Ross has been making a name for himself in Asia, at a time when many private equity investors are complaining about what they call the difficulty of finding attractive deals.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Ross's investment firm, W. L. Ross &amp; Company, joined with the American International Group, a leading American insurer, to invest $800 million in a mutual fund company that is part of South Korea's giant Hyundai conglomerate. Mr. Ross's firm also owns a life insurance company in South Korea and is managing the resolution of some defaulted loans for the South Korean government.</p>
        <p>In Japan, Mr. Ross has put money into a bankrupt auto parts manufacturer and the two banks. ''It's baloney to say there aren't opportunities in this region,'' Mr. Ross said. ''You just have to be prepared to do things differently than the way we do them in the United States.''</p>
        <p>In the bidding for Tokyo Sowa, Mr. Ross beat out Shinsei Bank, formerly known as Long-Term Credit Bank, which is owned by a group of investors led by Ripplewood Holdings, a Wall Street investment firm, and the H.I.S. Company, a travel agency that specializes in selling discount tickets. The government said the deal with Mr. Ross's group was the best for Japanese taxpayers. But officials at the Financial Reconstruction Commission, the agency overseeing the restructuring of the financial sector, may also be irritated with Shinsei because the bank has effectively put the government in the position of rescuing a private company.</p>
        <p>To facilitate the sale of Shinsei last year, the government pledged to buy back loans made by Shinsei whose value falls by a certain percentage. Shinsei exercised that agreement yesterday, placing the government in an awkward position.</p>
        <p>Critics of the government have said such an arrangement is unfairly generous to Shinsei and victimizes Japanese taxpayers.</p>
