      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>When I first tasted Frosty Bites at Sassy's Sliders, 1530 Third Avenue (86th Street), they reminded me of the nuggets of freeze-dried astronaut ice cream that every parent who takes children to the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington feels compelled to buy. Frosty Bites, ice cream bits the size of peppercorns, do have a futuristic quality, but they taste a lot better than freeze-dried. They are served in a cup, and you spoon them up like breakfast cereal. The sensation is a little odd, since they lack the softly melting surface of a scoop of ice cream. I can't imagine a rippled flavor like vanilla-fudge or caramel swirl being satisfying in this form, but for crunchy Oreo cookie it's just fine. Frosty Bites are $3.25 a portion and also come in vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, mint-chocolate and rainbow sorbet. Mixing's allowed.</p>
