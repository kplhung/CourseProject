        <p>In a deal that may break a logjam in promoting the secure downloading of music from the Internet, America Online said yesterday that it had agreed to include software from the InterTrust Technologies Corporation on compact discs containing AOL 6.0, the newest version of its own popular software, later this year.</p>
        <p>InterTrust allows a recording company to wrap music in software that ensures it will only be played according to rules specified by the company. Before downloading a song, customers would agree to terms like how much they would pay, or how long they would be able to play it. But to make that choice, they would need to have special software to interpret what is being offered.</p>

        <p>In a deal that may break a logjam in promoting the secure downloading of music from the Internet, America Online said yesterday that it had agreed to include software from the InterTrust Technologies Corporation on compact discs containing AOL 6.0, the newest version of its own popular software, later this year.</p>
        <p>InterTrust allows a recording company to wrap music in software that ensures it will only be played according to rules specified by the company. Before downloading a song, customers would agree to terms like how much they would pay, or how long they would be able to play it. But to make that choice, they would need to have special software to interpret what is being offered.</p>
        <p>Although the software would be invisible to users, getting it on enough computers to make the system worthwhile has been a problem.</p>
        <p>With more than 20 million subscribers and a notorious strategy for blanketing the nation with its compact discs, America Online could serve as a potent delivery vehicle.</p>
        <p>The online service also said that it would integrate InterTrust's system into a version of its Winamp music player, another piece of the digital music puzzle required to make secure distribution work. Already one of the most popular MP3 players, Winamp could become more attractive to companies seeking to securely distribute digital music.</p>
        <p>With the huge popularity of the MP3 format, which allows music to be sent quickly and at no cost across the Internet, the challenge for recording companies is to find a way to entice consumers to use a system that would require them to pay and restrict their ability to copy. But the music industry has been slow to even try, in part because of the difficulties in putting the technology in place.</p>
        <p>''So far, it's been that consumers don't need the players that use the secure format because there's no content in the format, and content owners don't put content in the secure format because the consumers don't have the players to play it,'' said Eric Sheirer, media and entertainment analyst for Forrester Research, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. ''This gets them over the chicken-and-egg hurdle.''</p>
        <p>Other companies competing in the area of digital rights management include Microsoft -- whose software is currently being used by Sony Music to distribute about 50 singles for $2.49 each that can be played only on Microsoft's Windows Media Player -- and I.B.M., which along with InterTrust is among the companies that Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment unit selected to use in its own digital download system, scheduled for introduction later this summer.</p>
        <p>Whether America Online's pending merger with Time Warner means that Warner Music will endorse InterTrust as a result of the deal is unclear.</p>
        <p>Even less clear is whether consumers will choose to use the technology of secure distribution, however easy it is made for them to do so.</p>
        <p>But Talal Shamoon, senior vice president for media at InterTrust, said America Online's large user base would be an ideal setting for a secure version of Napster, the widely used system for swapping pirated music files. For instance, music companies could harness AOL's subscribers to drive sales by offering incentives like free concert tickets to people who convince friends to buy a particular piece of digital music, Mr. Shamoon said.</p>
        <p>''We could be at the threshold of something very big,'' Mr. Shamoon added. ''A robust electronic community of people exchanging content in a safe way, where rights holders get paid and consumers feel good about the experience.''</p>
