        <p>A School's Grandpa</p>
        <p>Eighty-seven fifth graders at Community Elementary School 42 in the Morrisania section of the Bronx were surprised at graduation on Friday when they each received $100 checks from ALFRED KNOBLER, right, who graduated from the school in 1928.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knobler, 85, returned to the school four years ago. Since then, he has shown up every Tuesday to read to four classes. Students call him Grandpa Alfred. Janet L. Kaminsky, principal, calls him the school's ''guardian angel'' because he donates money to cultivate arts and for cultural outings. He even donated a baby grand piano.</p>
        <p>Changes at District 2</p>
        <p>ELAINE FINK, superintendent of Community School District 2, and one of her top deputies, ANDREW LACHMAN, are moving on.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fink is resigning effective Friday to move to San Diego. She would not disclose her plans there, but said through a spokesman that she would not be working for the San Diego schools. Her former boss, ANTHONY ALVARADO, is chief of instruction there. Under Mr. Alvarado, reading and math scores in District 2 rose steadily to make it New York City's second-ranked district. Mr. Alvarado left in 1998 and was succeeded by Ms. Fink.</p>
        <p>SHELLEY HARWAYNE, the former principal of the Manhattan New School on the Upper East Side, has been named acting superintendent, and is likely, officials said, to be a candidate for the permanent job.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lachman will become executive director of the Connecticut Center for School Change, a public policy group.</p>
        <p>Architect on CUNY Board</p>
        <p>GOV. GEORGE E. PATAKI has added an architectural designer, WELLINGTON Z. CHEN -- a City College graduate -- to the board of the City University of New York. Born in Taiwan, Mr. Chen lived in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Brazil before arriving in New York 30 years ago as a teenager. Because his English was poor, he was sent to woodworking class instead of being put on an academic track. But the woodworking teacher nurtured him and his classmates, and many of them went on to study architecture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen, a Democrat, is a senior vice president at the TDC Development Corporation, a real estate company in Queens.</p>
        <p>New Program for Gifted</p>
        <p>Community School District 29 in southeast Queens is introducing a large-scale program for gifted students this fall, with classes at eight of its elementary schools and five middle schools, said the acting district superintendent, MICHAEL A. JOHNSON. Students will be selected for the program based on test scores.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson said that he devised the program for those students who were already performing well and who would benefit from a more challenging workload.</p>
        <p>River City via White House</p>
        <p>When President Clinton visited Public School 96 in East Harlem on June 16, one of the speakers was KELVIN EUSEBIO, a fourth grader. Kelvin ended his speech with a spirited plea for tickets to ''The Music Man.'' In the audience was LARRY FISCHER, president of Time Warner City Cable. Mr. Fischer conveyed the message to Dodger Theatricals, the show's main producer, and yesterday, the producer treated Kelvin, his mother and his sister to tickets to last night's show.</p>
