        <p>Bargain hunters, perhaps it is time to consider a shopping trip to Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>Admittedly, it is a schlep, requiring a journey across Iran or over the rugged mountains of the Hindu Kush or through the steep gorges of the Khyber Pass.</p>
        <p>But in a place called Spinbaldak -- in the flat, desert terrain near the Pakistani border -- there are ever-so-cheap cars, television sets, stereos and cameras.</p>
        <p>Entire stores carry nothing but motor oil from England or sewing machines from Japan or wheel rims from just about anywhere. There are great deals on Vaseline Hair Tonic and Palmolive Shampoo. For those who prefer to buy in bulk, there are sets of 72 Duralex French tumblers, 10-packs of Sony tape cassettes and bars of Lux soap by the gross.</p>
        <p>Spinbaldak is like a Costco  crossed with a Salvation Army store and a flea market. There are about 100 shops, each one spare and decidedly inelegant. Most are merely open cargo containers -- 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep. There is no electricity. The climate control seems stuck on the notch that calls for a dust storm.</p>
        <p>But service is friendly. ''Sprechen Sie Deutsch?'' called out one merchant, Abdul Qadir. ''No? O.K., I speak a little English, too. And I give you the best deals.''</p>
        <p>Oddly enough, Mr. Qadir trades in television sets, which are banned by the Taliban militia, rulers of most of the country. But his customers are not Afghans. They are usually Pakistanis and Iranians here to buy on the cheap for themselves or for resale back home.</p>
        <p>''What you like?'' asked Mr. Qadir, a tall, persistent man standing before two rows of televisions stacked eye high, perhaps 70 in all. ''Samsung, Panasonic, Toshiba? Here look, I sell you a 29-inch Sony for 10,000 rupees'' (about $200).</p>
        <p>There are some hitches to buying appliances in Spinbaldak, and these became apparent as the sales pitch went on. ''I guarantee you that 80 percent of my televisions work,'' Mr. Qadir said. ''And the rest, easy to fix. No problem.''</p>
        <p>While the soap sold here is brand new, the appliances and cars are all used. These are goods discarded by Japanese families and gathered in large quantities by traders. They are then shipped to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and hauled into Afghanistan by truck.</p>
        <p>The small-time merchants of Spinbaldak buy the wares by the container full, either on their own or with partners. They sell the merchandise just as they bought it, unaware of whether it functions. In this part of the world, repairs are cheap.</p>
        <p>Until recently, there was no shortage of customers, but the new military government in Pakistan seems to be unusually serious about collecting customs duties at the border.</p>
        <p>In Spinbaldak, a three-hour drive from any sizable city, this surge in enforcement is a bother. More border guards means more people who must be bribed. Customers pass a far longer gantlet of open palms.</p>
        <p>These greedy men in uniforms can be avoided by employing a smuggler. Men with donkeys will carry just about anything along more discreet trails. But this does add to the buyer's expense, about $60 extra on that $200 television. At the same time, the condition of an appliance is unlikely to improve while it is strapped to the back of a donkey.</p>
        <p>''May I show you a camera?'' asked Abdul Bari, whose shop is more eclectic than the others, filled with hair dryers, clocks, ashtrays, motorcycle helmets and toaster  ovens.</p>
        <p>He opened a large suitcase full of cameras, displayed in a heap like ties at an end-of-the-season sale. ''For Nikon, I usually charge more,'' he said amiably. ''But for you, my friend, the price is the same and I will give you one that will work for sure.''</p>
        <p>Down the way, Gul Khan was selling sewing machines. By his guess, 90 percent were broken. ''But you cannot go wrong,'' he said. ''I'll sell you this machine for 250 rupees'' -- $5 -- ''and if you are worried about spare parts, you can buy two more at the same price.''</p>
        <p>The Taliban are popular here. When they began their conquest of the country in 1994, they received financial support from big traders who wanted the highways cleared of brigands. The Taliban have made travel in Afghanistan safe again, and they, in turn, make a hefty sum taxing cross-country shipments.</p>
        <p>''Before the Taliban, robbers would not only steal your vehicle, they'd take your money and maybe even your clothes,'' said Amir Muhammad, an auto dealer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Muhammad and several associates run a car lot. The autos, all Japanese models, were bought from traders in Dubai who have a take-it-or-leave-it attitude. They allow the cars to be started but not driven.</p>
        <p>Mr. Muhammad had a 1995 Toyota Land Cruiser on sale for $5,600. The interior was clean. The tires had treads. The engine operated without a cough. But was it a good vehicle?</p>
        <p>Mr. Muhammad considered the question. ''If you want a cheap car, this is the right place,'' he said bluntly. ''If you want a perfect car, maybe you should go somewhere else.''</p>
