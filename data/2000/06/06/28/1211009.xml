        <p>Leon Johnson, the versatile running back whose career was threatened recently by knee surgery, was cut outright by the Jets yesterday.</p>
        <p>Johnson is at least the fourth key player for the Jets to be cut or traded since the end of last season.</p>
        <p>Earlier, wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson was traded, and left tackle Jumbo Elliott and linebacker Chad Cascadden were released.</p>
        <p>Johnson had been attempting to return from a season-ending injury last year in which he tore ligaments in his left knee in the opening game of the season.</p>
        <p>But he reinjured his knee recently, either at the Jets' minicamp in late May or while working out on his own.</p>
        <p>The team has not said exactly how Johnson reinjured his knee, and the circumstances remain clouded. His agent, Art Weiss, did not return phone calls seeking a comment.</p>
        <p>In any event, Johnson recently underwent knee surgery again, which a person with knowledge of the injury described as ''career-threatening.''</p>
        <p>If the Jets had cut him and given him a so-called ''injury settlement,'' they would have been unable to sign Johnson again. But his $450,000 contract included a clause that called for him to be paid $220,000 in the event he could not play because of an injury. That clause was exercised, thus Johnson is free to sign with another team if he recovers, and he is also free to renegotiate with the Jets.</p>
        <p>Johnson, who would be entering his fourth season, participated in the minicamp, which was open to the news media. He was not observed to have an injury. The next week, however, the workouts were closed.</p>
        <p>But Johnson, one of the league's best kick-returners as a rookie in 1997, also went with his teammate Dedric Ward to a charity game in Iowa recently. The Jets will not say whether Johnson played in that game.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Jets remain without a big receiver, and yesterday they entertained the Seattle Seahawks' 6-foot-4-inch free agent, SEAN DAWKINS. Dawkins is a viable alternative to the Cincinnati Bengals' CARL PICKENS, who could be available in the next few weeks.</p>
