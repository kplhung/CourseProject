        <p>If seizing the moment were an Olympic event, like figure skating, Noel Coward's characters would surely take the honors for form. True, they generally don't have the athleticism of American hedonists; ''seize,'' in fact, may not be quite the correct word for what they do.</p>
        <p>But as demonstrated in the choppy but intriguing Williamstown Theater Festival production of ''Tonight at 8:30,'' a sextet of short Coward plays presented over two evenings, much can be said for savoring fleeting joys with the restraint and rueful elegance of the people portrayed here.</p>
        <p>Even when they break into spontaneous song, which they do in the most unexpected places, these charmed souls keep their backs straight, their smiles suave and their eyebrows arched. Their choice of rhythms, as often as not, is waltz time. And their crisply rhymed lyrics are as tart as they are sentimental, as in:</p>
        <p>Life needn't be gray,</p>
        <p>Although it's changing day by day,</p>
        <p>Though a few old dreams may decay,</p>
        <p>Play, orchestra, play.</p>
        <p>That fragment of song comes from ''Shadow Play,'' a surreal and fluid vision of life as a dark musical comedy and a work that prompted the critic Kenneth Tynan to identify Coward as a precursor to Harold Pinter. It appears on the second part of the bill at Williamstown, under the direction of Ann Reinking, and it may come as a slight jolt to audience members who know Coward only for ''Private Lives'' and ''Blithe Spirit.''</p>
        <p>Its tone is throughly typical of the Coward regularly performed in repertory; its form is less obviously so. The same might be said of two of the offerings in the first trio of plays, directed by Michael Greif, in which thought-defining songs erupt among both a group of Victorian mourners and a tense romantic triangle at a colonial supper club.</p>
        <p>As a character in ''Shadow Play'' speculates, ''It would be so much easier if we had music when things go wrong, music and a little dancing.'' Coward, being a gentleman, saw fit to grant that wish, and the results, if imperfectly executed in these productions, are truly fascinating.</p>
        <p>In selecting from the nine plays that originally made up ''Tonight at 8:30,'' first performed in rotation in London in 1936 as starring vehicles for Coward and Gertrude Lawrence, the Williamstown Theater Festival hasn't gone for the obvious, sidestepping such well-known pieces as ''Still Life'' (the basis for the film ''Brief Encounter'') and ''Fumed Oak.''</p>
        <p>In fact, ''Star Chamber,'' a broadly entertaining satiric portrait of a committee meeting of self-serving actors here directed by Ms. Reinking, was not part of either the West End or Broadway cycle, having been eliminated on the road.</p>
        <p>The choices of directors and cast aren't obvious either. Mr. Greif is best known for staging the popular rock musical ''Rent,'' while Ms. Reinking is primarily identified as a star of and choreographer for the works of Bob Fosse. Yet there's a strange modernity about these little quasi-musicals that justifies the pairings of directors and plays.</p>
        <p>It has to be said that the strategy pays off only intermittently. There is a bedrock Englishness about Coward that it's hard for Americans to conquer, especially with the limited rehearsal time allowed for the Williamstown productions. On the other hand, what fun is a summer festival if it doesn't take a few risks? And if you're patient, you'll find that ''Tonight at 8:30,'' in addition to presenting Coward that few people know firsthand, offers some delicious surprises.</p>
        <p>There is, for example, the fact that the soigne, dramatically understated husband in ''Shadow Play,'' wearing a silk bed jacket, of course, is played by Bill Irwin, the great physical (and usually silent) comic performer of ''Fool Moon.'' Mr. Irwin does admirably by his quintessentially Cowardesque part, both dashing and melancholy at once.</p>
        <p>In the other two playlets directed by Ms. Reinking, ''Red Peppers'' and ''Star Chamber,'' Mr. Irwin plays music hall comedians, which would seem to be a natural fit. But while his rubber-limbed, rubber-faced animation is as winning as always, the actor's cockney accent begs for subtitles, which is unfortunate with as verbal a playwright as Coward.</p>
        <p>Charlotte d'Amboise, the luscious dancer-actress, is a splendid cockney as Mr. Irwin's spitfire wife and partner in ''Red Peppers,'' and the pair's opening dance together is a treat, despite uncertain vocal harmony. Ms. d'Amboise also takes on the Gertrude Lawrence role in ''Shadow Play,'' that of a Mayfair socialite with a troubled marriage. Her all-American enthusiasm and energy run against the grain of her brittle character here, though she is lovely in a hauntingly conflicted dream ballet by Ms. Reinking.</p>
        <p>The two sets of plays also feature such familiar theatrical faces as Stephen Collins, Terrence Mann (unrecognizable in three gruff character roles, which he clearly relishes) and Deborah Rush, who is quite delectable (if a touch too Hollywood) as a silly West End diva in ''Star Chamber.'' Jessica Stone, a young performer with pitch-perfect command of Coward-era style, delivers a piquant version of the song ''World Weary'' in a maid's uniform.</p>
        <p>But it is Blythe Danner, a Williamstown stalwart, who seems most at home in the handsomely appointed sets by Allen Moyer. Ms. Danner appears in all three of the works directed by Mr. Greif, and whether portraying a Victorian matron (''Family Album''), a dizzy society hostess modeled on Edwina Mountbatten (''Hands Across the Sea'') or a colonial wife on the brink of bolting from her marriage (''We Were Dancing''), the actress projects a seductive certainty of tone.</p>
        <p>Though rarely associated with broad comedy, Ms. Danner is deliriously funny in ''Hands'' as her garrulous, absent-minded character steamrolls her way through a rare moment of social uncertainty. She is more restrained, to equally appealing effect, in ''Album'' and ''Dancing,'' wearing a cryptic, contented smile that hints at a interior dialogue with the nuances of Coward's bittersweet worldview.</p>
        <p>In ''Dancing,'' Ms. Danner, playing a woman who arbitrarily falls in and out of love in the course of one evening, has occasion to slide without fanfare into song. A worldly siren in closely wrapped white chiffon, the actress turns singer with an enchanting lack of self-consciousness that makes you wonder why she hasn't been starring in musicals on Broadway.</p>
        <p>Here she is the ideal embodiment of Coward's wayward but precise emotional logic and of his suggestion that pure happiness can be measured, at best, only in seconds. ''There has never been a moment like this moment before in the history of the world,'' Ms. Danner's love-struck character proclaims in ''Dancing.'' The moment passes, as such moments inevitably do in Coward's world. But not before it has been expressed in urbane, moonlight-worshiping song.</p>
