        <p>Something truly wonderful has been happening in Atlanta this baseball season, but unfortunately it has been obscured by the blather of John Rocker.</p>
        <p>Just turned 39, Andres Galarraga has bounced back from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of cancer in his lower back. After a full year of inactivity and four months of rebuilding in the gym, he has made one of the great recoveries in the history of sport.</p>
        <p>''The Big Cat -- it's a wonderful story,'' said Joe Torre of the Yankees, who is recovering from prostate cancer. ''It gives hope to a lot of people with cancer. He lets people know there's life out there.''</p>
        <p>If there is any justice in the world, Torre will be managing against Galarraga in the All-Star Game in Atlanta on July 11. Galarraga is currently second in the voting behind Mark McGwire, and his own manager, Bobby Cox, gets to fill out the roster.</p>
        <p>''It's a phenomenal happening,'' Cox said recently of Galarraga. ''It's a tribute to medical science plus the strength of somebody's heart.''</p>
        <p>There are miracles all around us. We must never become jaded to the advances in heart bypass surgery, organ transplant, cancer treatment, joint replacement, techniques that were not available a decade or a generation ago. When they are personified in a very public man of grace like Galarraga, the message is as vivid as the pealing of bells.</p>
        <p>He had a backache at the end of the 1998 season, and the doctors discovered the lymphoma in the third lumbar vertebra in the lower back, and said he would need five months of chemotherapy and a short series of radiation.</p>
        <p>He was feeling well enough to join the Braves late in the 1999 season, and stay in uniform right through the four-game loss to the Yankees in the World Series.</p>
        <p>''He lit up the clubhouse; it was great for the club,'' Brian Jordan said. ''You pray for him. You can't explain what's happening. With his smile, you know angels are watching over him.''</p>
        <p>The doctors and his personal angels got him to a point last November, but then Galarraga had to push himself toward major league condition.</p>
        <p>''When I saw myself in the mirror, I didn't believe it,'' Galarraga said the other day. ''I said, 'Wow, I have to lose weight.' ''</p>
        <p>Once again, his angels were with him. Instead of going home to Venezuela in the winter, Galarraga went to Powerhouse Gym on Okeechobee Road in West Palm Beach, Fla. There he introduced himself to a muscular trainer named Eric V. Peterman, a former social worker dedicated to ''drug-free'' body-building.</p>
        <p>''I had no idea who he was,'' Peterman said on Monday. ''I never really followed baseball. It turned out I had seen him discussing his illness on television but I never once made the connection.''</p>
        <p>Peterman was neither a hero-worshiper, nor was he squeamish about working with a man recovering from cancer.</p>
        <p>''In my profession, I worked with multiproblem adolescents and later I worked with sexual abuse,'' Peterman said. ''None of this stuff fazed me.''</p>
        <p>Peterman had also worked out with members of the Cleveland Browns in his hometown, so he knew how hard he could push.</p>
        <p>''Professional athletes have a totally different passion from everybody else,'' Peterman said. ''Their health and fitness are the key to their success. Without that, they have no career, no lucrative contract. I realized he's a pro. Hee wants to win. He wants to get back on that stage.''</p>
        <p>They worked out routines that would put no stress on the weakened bones and muscles in the lower back. At first, Galarraga was capable of a biceps curl with only the 45-pound bar; four months later, he was curling between 115 and 135 pounds.</p>
        <p>''He was also watching his diet, starting to run, then he went to the batting cage,'' Peterman recalled. ''He would slam the ball and come back with a grin on his face like he'd discovered a new kind of candy.''</p>
        <p>By February, Galarraga was in shape to report to spring training. Bobby Cox, moving at a newfound trot on his own surgically rebuilt knees, followed Galarraga out to a batting cage.</p>
        <p>''He shocked us,'' Cox said. ''We had gotten Wally Joyner just in case, but Andres hit balls 500 feet the first day. We were going to take it easy, but he was in as good a shape as anybody.</p>
        <p>''The doctor said, 'Go ahead, keep going.' You didn't know if he should take it easy. He dictated everything. He played as if everything was normal.''</p>
        <p>Jordan recalled: ''I came in early this spring, I saw him, you had to ask, 'Was he ever ill?' It couldn't happen to a nicer guy.''</p>
        <p>Galarraga got off to a strong start, and has never slipped. Going into last night's game in Montreal, Galarraga was batting .308 with 18 homers and 55 runs batted in playing in 70 of the Braves' 75 games. He thanked Peterman by flying him up to a homestand and introducing him around the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to stay alive,'' Galarraga said recently. ''I also wanted to be here with my glove and bat. I had to keep myself strong.''</p>
        <p>His strength, both physical and mental, has been a marvel to those who have been paying attention.</p>
        <p>When the Braves arrive at Shea Stadium tomorrow, a warm salute for Andres Galarraga would be a perfect way for fans to exorcise the prejudiced toxins let loose by John Rocker.</p>
