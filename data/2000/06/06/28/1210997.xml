        <p>George Zahringer III of Deepdale Golf Club in Manhasset, N.Y., a two-time champion in the Met Life/Met Golf Association Ike Tournament, shot a three-under-par 66 for the first-round lead in the event yesterday at the Nassau Country Club in Glen Cove, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The 47-year-old Zahringer, the winner in 1989 and 1993, held a three-stroke lead over Andy Svoboda, Jim Graham and Larry Hall in the stroke-play competition.</p>
        <p>''I played in only five tournaments last year,'' Zahringer said, ''and I closed the season by winning the Nassau Invitational on this very same course. That gave me great psychological confidence for this year.''</p>
        <p>A field of 98 started, and the cut was six-over 75, leaving 45 players remaining for today's final 36 holes. Par is normally 70, but it was dropped to 69 because of the recent heavy rains.</p>
        <p>Ken Macdonald, the defending champion, registered a 70 along with his cousin Dan Macdonald and Mike Hyland. Ed Gibstein, who captured the Ike in 1994, is one of three players at 71. Jerry Courville Jr., a three-time winner, the last being in 1997, is at 72.</p>
