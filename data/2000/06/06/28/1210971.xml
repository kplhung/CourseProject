        <p>New government data shows just how far prosperity has spread across America, with stock options, two-career couples and capital gains helping to lift a record number of families to six-figure annual incomes. One taxpayer in 15 resided in this economic realm in 1998, the government reported yesterday -- an increase of 1.1 million over 1997.</p>
        <p>The number of taxpayers (the I.R.S. counts a married couple who file jointly as one taxpayer) with incomes of $100,000 or more soared in 1998 to 8.3 million, up 15 percent from 7.2 million in 1997, preliminary figures from 1998 income tax returns showed..</p>
        <p>The thick book of dry statistical tables issued by the Internal Revenue Service included some minor surprises.</p>
        <p>The data helps explain why federal tax revenues are surging, prompting President Clinton on Monday to raise the budget surplus over the next decade to $1.9 trillion, from the February estimate of $792 billion.</p>
        <p>Analysis of the I.R.S. data also showed that the share of the economic pie going to those making $100,000 or more expanded to 36.9 percent in 1998 from 34.2 percent in 1997.</p>
        <p>In the first glimpse of the impact of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the taxes paid by these prosperous Americans rose 30.4 percent as more of their income was subject to the 31 percent, 36 percent and 39.6 percent rates.</p>
        <p>The 6.6 percent of taxpayers earning more than $100,000 paid 58 percent of all income taxes in 1998.</p>
        <p>Many more taxpayers -- 828,000, a 40 percent increase over the previous year -- paid the Alternative Minimum Tax in 1998, the new data shows. The tax, which phases out deductions for state and local taxes, and even for children, was adopted 31 years ago to stop rich taxpayers from making such aggressive use of legitimate tax breaks that they paid no federal income taxes.</p>
        <p>''This shows how this frightening tax complexity monster is growing in our midst,'' said David Keating of the National Taxpayers Union.</p>
        <p>Because Congress has not updated the law for inflation, the minimum tax now reaches so far down the economic ladder that it can sometimes tax a single parent making $28,000.</p>
        <p>The new tax data also raised questions about the effectiveness of the sharp reduction in capital gains taxes, a major element of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which was sponsored by the House Republican leadership.</p>
        <p>The highest long-term capital gains rate was cut to 20 percent, from 28 percent in 1996 and part of 1997, yet the rate of growth in capital gains fell by half, from 48 percent in 1996 to 22 percent in 1998.</p>
        <p>Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, promoted the lower rate as a key to increasing savings and investment and building a prosperous future. At first glance, taxpayers with incomes less than $15,000 seem to be lagging behind inflation. But interpreting the data is hard because the lowest income category is now heavy with rich children.</p>
        <p>The number of people with incomes of less than $15,000 declined by 3 percent, from 40.4 million in 1997 to 40.1 million in 1998. Still, the average income grew by just 0.6 percent, far less than the rate of inflation, to $6,290, an increase of a scant $45 over 1997. Complicating the picture is the growing number of prosperous families who must file tax returns in the names of children who have their own college funds.</p>
        <p>The one indication that the lowest income category is now heavy with rich children is that 44 percent of this group's income came from capital gains, four times the contribution of capital gains to the incomes of those making $30,000 to $100,000.</p>
        <p>Analysis of the I.R.S. data also showed that the boom at the top is  overwhelmingly the result of more people crossing the $100,000 income threshold, rather than of increases in income among those already there.</p>
        <p>Among the 6.2 million taxpayers making $100,000 to $200,000, the average income fell by $514, to $131,189, from $131,703 in 1997. This suggests that many people just made it over the $100,000 threshold.</p>
        <p>Among the 2 million taxpayers making more than $200,000, total income was up a robust 17.7 percent, but the average income rose only 3.1 percent to $568,941.</p>
