        <p>The number of American households that cared for parents or relatives afflicted with the infirmities of old age tripled between 1988 and 1996, to 21 million from 7 million. And corporate America was quick to lend a helping hand.</p>
        <p>Forty-seven percent of large companies surveyed by Hewitt Associates said they offered elder-care programs in 1999, up from 20 percent in 1993. The most common forms of assistance, available at 40 percent of the corporations, were resource and referral programs. These services list options and openings throughout the nation and are intended to save time when searching for care providers.</p>
        <p>In addition, 32 percent of the respondents offered dependent-care spending accounts, which enable employees to shelter a part of their earnings used for elder care from taxes, while 17 percent offered long-term care insurance, usually not subsidized by the employer.</p>
        <p>The growth of programs reflects the surge in workers who also are caring for an older loved one. In 1997, the Families and Work Institute found that almost half of workers expected to provide such care within five years.</p>
        <p>Carol Sladek, a consultant at Hewitt, notes that the programs can be set up at relatively low expense to employers. Resource and referral programs that include both child and elder care cost an average of only $10 to $15 per employee, she said.</p>
