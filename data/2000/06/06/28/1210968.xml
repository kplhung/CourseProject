        <p>A terrifying surge of communal violence, apparently fueled by anti-government agitators in Jakarta, is tearing apart the remote and beautiful islands of Maluku, raising fears of destabilization throughout Indonesia's ailing archipelago.</p>
        <p>More than 200 people have reportedly been killed in the last week in village massacres and in street fighting in the small city of Ambon, pushing the death toll during the last 18 months to more than 2,500.</p>
        <p>The unchecked fighting in Maluku, once known as the Spice Islands, has become one of the main challenges to the political control of President Abdurrahman Wahid, who faces a possible vote of no confidence in a parliamentary assembly in August.</p>
        <p>''This has become a very serious issue,'' said Umar Juoro, a former presidential aide who heads an Islamic policy institute. ''Now when you go to the mosque or you go to church you are hearing about the killing of Muslims and the killing of Christians. This is getting into our daily lives around Indonesia.''</p>
        <p>''This is much more serious for Indonesia than East Timor because it involves a conflict of elites in Jakarta,'' Mr. Juoro said of the former Portuguese colony that broke away in August and was never an integral part of national affairs.</p>
        <p>The government's inability to curb the violence is adding to a perception among some Indonesians that Mr. Wahid is unable to control an array of powerful and vengeful forces that were disenfranchised with the overthrow of former President Suharto two years ago.</p>
        <p>Analysts suggest an array of disaffected groups that may be involved: loyalists or family members of Mr. Suharto who fear punishment by the government; extremist Islamic groups seeking to create a less moderate leadership in this largely Muslim nation; elements of the military who oppose the downgrading of their political role in Indonesia, and powerful economic interests seeking to maintain their control.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Wahid has sought to foster good will, his nine months in office have seen repeated outbreaks of religious violence, many apparently provoked by unidentified agitators, including attacks on mosques and churches as well as communal fighting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid continues to command widespread respect for his liberal and democratic goals. But the quality of his leadership has also come into question from a series of financial scandals, political missteps and seemingly intemperate comments.</p>
        <p>Critics say he has been slow to act on the Maluku fighting as well as on other pressing issues. His defenders say that the deep-rooted problems he faces defy aggressive solutions. In this case, the situation has only spiraled further out of control.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Wahid announced a state of emergency in Maluku on Monday and vowed to disarm the combatants, he drew an anguished reaction from local residents reached by telephone, who said they feared the military as much as the local religious gangs.</p>
        <p>''The military is no longer capable of stopping the conflict,'' said Joseph Tethool, the Roman Catholic bishop of Ambon, who sent a letter this weekend to the United Nations pleading for international help. ''Many soldiers have taken sides.''</p>
        <p>The Rev. Sammy Titaley, who heads the Protestant churches in Ambon, said the fighting had escalated to include mortars, automatic weapons and even small armored vehicles, a sign of organized military involvement.</p>
        <p>In a scene reminiscent of the violence last year in East Timor, the local military appears to have run out of control, arming civilian combatants and, according to witnesses, sometimes leading the attacks.</p>
        <p>But in East Timor, the rogue military groups were clearly better organized and commanded from above. In Maluku, the chain of command appears to have broken down more thoroughly as Muslim soldiers join the Muslim side and Christian soldiers join with Christian fighters.</p>
        <p>''Even the commanders cannot control their men,'' said Umelto Labetubun, a student who lives on the Christian side of the now-divided town. ''One Christian soldier stopped by my house, a first lieutenant, and he said, 'Some of my men are on the other side and they are now shooting at us.' ''</p>
        <p>But the problem goes well beyond a breakdown of military command.</p>
        <p>''The problem is that the government of Abdurrahman Wahid is weak,'' said Salim Said, a political scientist. ''If you do not have a strong government in this country you cannot overcome the many problems that are the legacy of the old government. The old government was put down but not destroyed. It is still very strong.''</p>
        <p>One of the most obvious signs of trouble has been the influx in recent weeks of 2,200 white-robed Muslim fighters calling themselves the Laskar Jihad, who were mostly organized and trained at a camp near Jakarta.</p>
        <p>Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsonso, in a recent interview, said  there was no way to stop them from boarding interisland ferries and traveling to the area, where they then received weapons from unknown sources.</p>
        <p>Local residents said they believed that those fighters were involved in a horrific massacre a week ago at the village of Duma on the island of Halmahera, where church workers said 206 Christian villagers were killed in an attack that lasted just one hour.</p>
        <p>Members of Laskar Jihad have said they are engaged in ''self-defense'' and the attack on Duma was described as a revenge attack. Last December, hundreds of Muslims were killed on Halmahera by Christian gangs.</p>
        <p>''It is a very complicated, very big problem, because national politics is involved,'' the Maluku governor, Saleh Latuconsina, told a Dutch journalist last month. ''The Laskar Jihad is connected to some political elite, because they can come to Ambon without anyone stopping them. Maybe it's from the people of the status quo . . . well, Suharto.''</p>
        <p>The governor, himself a Muslim, said he believed that ''not more than 10 percent'' of the people of either religion wanted to fight.</p>
        <p>A European political scientist who has lived in Maluku said the most disturbing thing was that villagers could be so easily provoked to go to war with each other.</p>
        <p>More than 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people are Muslim, making this the world's largest Muslim nation. But they have traditionally lived in harmony with religious minorities. Maluku is one of the few areas where Christians and Muslims live in nearly equal numbers.</p>
        <p>''The areas in Ambon and Halmahera where the killings are going on are places I worked 10 years ago, and I found them to be some of the more peaceful and beautiful places I have visited anywhere in the world,'' said the scholar. ''It does not bear thinking what would happen if groups in other parts of Indonesia begin attacking their fellow Indonesians for religious reasons.''</p>
        <p>Last month more than 120 people were killed and thousands of people were driven from their homes when Muslims fought Christians for several days on the island of Sulawesi in eastern Indonesia.</p>
        <p>In Maluku, the divisions have spread to the military in a way they have not done elsewhere. When a national police barracks in Ambon was burned down last week, Mr. Labetubun said, some of the attackers were wearing police uniforms.</p>
        <p>Told of the president's imposition of a state of emergency, he only laughed in despair.</p>
        <p>''The military is just making it worse,'' he said. ''I am crying because I cannot stand it any more. The military is shooting at us so how can we trust the military? We cannot trust anybody.''</p>
        <p>He said Ambon, the regional center, is now ''a dead city'' where banks have closed and food and fuel are becoming scarce. ''The day time is just like the night time,'' he said. ''No one goes out of the house. You hear no sound, no car. Then you hear the shooting and explosions.''</p>
