        <p>The Energy Department has failed to convince scientists at the government's nuclear weapons laboratories of the need for tougher security and counterintelligence measures to prevent espionage, according to a new Congressional report.</p>
        <p>Because senior officials have not won the support of the scientific community at the three national weapons laboratories, their efforts to impose tougher security rules have fallen short, according to the report by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.</p>
        <p>New regulations imposed by the Energy Department in the wake of accusations of Chinese nuclear espionage at Los Alamos National Laboratory were not accompanied by a strong effort by department officials to sell the changes to the rank-and-file at the laboratories, the report said. As a result, there has been open rebellion against plans to subject key weapons scientists to polygraph examinations, while counterintelligence training efforts at the laboratories have been dismal.</p>
        <p>''No organization, governmental or private, can have effective counterintelligence without active, visible and sustained support from management and active 'buy-in' by the employees,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>Energy Secretary Bill Richardson's plan to require about 800 laboratory employees to undergo polygraph examinations as part of a more stringent counterintelligence program has drawn intense criticism from laboratory employees over the past few months. Laboratory employees have worn buttons to work with slogans like ''Just say no to the polygraph.''</p>
        <p>''The attitude toward polygraphs at the laboratories runs the gamut from cautiously and rationally negative to emotionally and irrationally negative,'' the report found. ''Moreover, since the polygraph is a highly visible part of the overall counterintelligence effort, the entire counterintelligence program has been negatively affected by this development.''</p>
        <p>The report was the result of a review of counterintelligence at the laboratories conducted by a special panel headed by Paul Redmond, former chief of counterintelligence at the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
        <p>The Redmond panel was created by the House intelligence committee in response to the furor over charges that China may have stolen nuclear data from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. The study was conducted before the latest security problem: hard drives containing sensitive information about nuclear weapons that were missing for several weeks.</p>
        <p>The report acknowledged that the scientists have some legitimate concerns about whether such a large polygraph program could be implemented fairly. But the report also noted that part of the problem was that the scientists believed they were ''indispensable and special, and thus should be exempt from such demeaning and intrusive measures as the polygraph.''</p>
        <p>The report criticized the Energy Department's effort to explain the need for polygraphs to employees as ''ineffectual.'' The Redmond panel found that while the resistance to polygraphs had in some cases been ''unreasonable,'' the Energy Department's response had been ''dictatorial and pre-emptory.''</p>
        <p>The panel urged the Energy Department to get local managers at the laboratories more heavily involved in selecting the employees who should undergo polygraph examinations because of the sensitive nature of their work.</p>
        <p>The panel also recommended that the Energy Department and the laboratories model their counterintelligence programs after those used at the National Security Agency, the government's secret code-breaking and eavesdropping arm. The agency, like the national laboratories, employs many highly educated people with strong academic backgrounds. While the laboratories employ physicists and other scientists, the security agency employs world-class mathematicians and cryptographers.</p>
        <p>''The key factor in N.S.A.'s success in the training and awareness appears to be that its overall integrated security and counterintelligence program has been in existence for many years, and the mathematicians enter a culture where, from the very beginning of their employment, security, counterintelligence and the polygraph are givens in their daily work,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department, it continued, ''is now starting virtually from scratch and would do well to learn from the positive experiences of agencies such as N.S.A.''</p>
