        <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency said yesterday in a report to Congress that a quarter or more of houses within 500 feet of the United States coast may be lost to erosion in the next 60 years, putting intolerable strain on the federal Flood Insurance Program.</p>

        <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency said yesterday in a report to Congress that a quarter or more of houses within 500 feet of the United States coast may be lost to erosion in the next 60 years, putting intolerable strain on the federal Flood Insurance Program.</p>
        <p>The report called for a major new effort to map coastal erosion, identify hazard areas and raise premiums in the insurance program, perhaps even doubling them, to take erosion risk into account. And it suggested that the agency consider adopting setback requirements to limit building at the edge of the sea.</p>
        <p>Though the report covers all ocean and Great Lakes coasts, it said the erosion problem was particularly severe on the Atlantic, where beaches retreat on average two to three feet a year, and the Gulf Coast, where the overall annual erosion rate is six feet.</p>
        <p>More than 1,500 coastal structures now fall to erosion annually, James Lee Witt, director of the emergency management agency, said in an interview yesterday, adding that the figure could rise to as many as 10,000 in 10 years. Almost 350,000 houses are within 500 feet of the coastline, according to the report. Though most are not covered by the federal program, ''we have a lot more structures out there at risk than we anticipated,'' Mr. Witt said.</p>
        <p>He said the situation would get worse if sea level continued to rise and Americans continued to migrate toward coastal regions.</p>
        <p>''You have on average 3,600 people relocating to these regions per day,'' he said. ''You're looking at an awful lot of risk.''</p>
        <p>Stephen P. Leatherman, a coastal geologist at Florida International University, where he heads the International Hurricane Center, led the team of researchers who produced the report.</p>
        <p>''A lot people have been startled by the findings,'' Mr. Leatherman said. ''What we see is a lot of properties that have been insured by FEMA that were built when there was a wide beach and a big sand dune. Those have either been diminished or in some places are completely gone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Witt said erosion hazard maps and better building codes would reduce property damage, but he also praised setback requirements as ''a first step and a good step.''</p>
        <p>Advocates for coastal property owners called the report a thinly disguised effort to use federal insurance regulations to force people off the beach.</p>
        <p>''There is a small group of self-proclaimed experts who are convinced that no one should live anywhere near the coast,'' the American Coastal Coalition, an advocacy group for coastal communities, said in a statement. ''Unfortunately the report cloaks bad policy recommendations in the garments of scientific respectability.''</p>
        <p>Howard Marlowe, the coalition's president, said in an interview that it was important for coastal residents, or prospective coastal residents, to understand the hazards. But Mr. Marlowe said the federal government should not use its insurance program to discourage people who want to build at the coast.</p>
        <p>As for setback requirements, he said it was crucial for decisions to be made locally. ''We don't want to put the federal government into the business of making zoning ordinances,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Michael Buckley, who heads FEMA's mapping effort, said the agency would seek Congressional approval of money to cover erosion mapping and whatever authorization was needed for changes in insurance rates. A similar effort, including setback requirements, foundered a decade ago amid opposition from representatives of coastal areas.</p>
        <p>The agency administers the Flood Insurance Program, which since its establishment in 1968 has offered coverage to homeowners in coastal areas who might otherwise have been unable to obtain it. Towns seeking to make the insurance available to residents must enact FEMA-approved building codes that, among other things, call for structures to be elevated in zones where flood waters would spread in major storms. Structures built in compliance with FEMA codes have consistently survived with less damage in coastal storms.</p>
        <p>Critics assert that the program, by offering coverage that private insurance companies are increasingly unwilling to provide, inadvertently encourages unwise development of the coast.</p>
        <p>In any event, in establishing its zones and insurance rates, the program did not take erosion into account. The report issued yesterday says that was a mistake.</p>
        <p>''Within the first few hundred feet bordering the nation's coast, property owners face as large a risk of damage from erosion as they do from flooding,'' it says. Unless rates are altered to reflect that risk, it says, ''erosion losses will be subsidized by policyholders in noneroding areas or general taxpayers.''</p>
        <p>To fully reflect this risk, the report says, insurance rates in high-risk areas would be, on average, twice as high as they are now, typically $700 to $2,000 per $100,000 worth of coverage. Coverage is capped at $250,000 for a house and $100,000 for its contents.</p>
        <p>The report, produced by the H. John Heinz III Center for Science Economics and Environment under contract with FEMA, is available at www.heinzcenter.org.</p>
        <p>It estimates that it would cost about $5 million a year to identify erosion hazard areas, map them, maintain the maps and make the information available to potential buyers or local officials. But the investment would save money in the long run, it says, because ''if all currently empty lots in areas most susceptible to erosion are built on, damage from erosion would rise by roughly $100 million per year for the value of the structures alone.''</p>
        <p>The report notes that several methods, notably beach nourishment and hard structures like groins, revetments or sea walls can protect structures on the beach. But hard structures can, as the report put it, ''have negative impacts on the physical and aesthetic characteristics of beaches.'' And replacing sand lost from eroding beaches costs an average of $300,000 a year per mile of coast, the report said.</p>
        <p>''Shoreline protection measures can augment, but are not substitutes for, other options,'' it says.</p>
