        <p>In what has become a midseason pennant race if not a morality play, the Mets mowed down still another victim last night and began to set the table for the four-game visit by the Atlanta Braves that starts tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>Glendon Rusch, with relief help from John Franco and Armando Benitez, helped the Mets extend their winning string to six games with a 5-2 victory over the Florida Marlins at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>''You could feel the fans' energy,'' Franco said of his dramatic strikeout of the Marlins slugger Preston Wilson with the bases loaded and two out in the eighth. ''But I had to stay cool.''</p>
        <p>Just as significant as the streak is the fact that the Mets chopped another game off the first-place Braves' lead in National League East. It is down to two games, with the Mets facing the Marlins again tonight before the curtain parts on the theatrics of the long weekend.</p>
        <p>''Sure I watched the scoreboard,'' said Todd Pratt, who started at catcher to give Mike Piazza a rest. ''But this isn't a pennant race yet.''</p>
        <p>Don't tell that to Rusch. He understands that the Mets are waiting for the Braves.</p>
        <p>Rusch pitched deep into the eighth inning, and allowed only five hits. Then he yielded a single to Mark Kotsay with two out after another Marlin had reached base on an error.</p>
        <p>Franco came on and handcuffed Cliff Floyd, who hit a bouncer off first base, then beat the throw to Franco, who was covering the bag. With the bases loaded and the Mets up by three, Wilson took his stance.</p>
        <p>Franco got the count to 1-2 and then tossed a fastball past the flailing Wilson. Franco pumped the air and dashed off the mound.</p>
        <p>Benitez took over in the ninth, and got his 18th save in the shadow of the showdown with Atlanta. ''None of us,'' said center fielder Jay Payton, ''are talking about the Braves among ourselves. It just hasn't come up in conversation.''</p>
        <p>That will change. ''Definitely,'' Rusch said. ''We all know what's going on. It'll be going on the last three months of the season.''</p>
        <p>If the Mets continue to get help from players like Melvin Mora, who has capably replaced the injured Rey Ordonez at shortstop, or Benny Agbayani, who has taken over impressively in left field since the release of Rickey Henderson, there will be production from unexpected sources.</p>
        <p>Rusch was formidable the first three innings last night. After mowing down the first eight batters, the left-hander yielded a bunt single by the opposing starter, Jesus Sanchez, down the third-base line.</p>
        <p>Mora immediately produced a highlight-film dive to end the inning. The shortstop pounced to his left to snare Luis Castillo's sharp grounder up the middle. Mora set himself and then shoveled the ball to second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo for the force.</p>
        <p>''The one thing on my mind is to play the best defense I can,'' Mora said. ''That will give us victories. It let us keep it close.''</p>
        <p>But Rusch was not so lucky in the fourth. Kotsay and Floyd reached with a single and double, and both scored on sacrifice flies, from Wilson and Mike Lowell.</p>
        <p>The Mets responded with a sacrifice fly of their own in the bottom half. They loaded the bases on a single and two walks before Payton lofted a fly to short right that scored Derek Bell.</p>
        <p>Agbayani, who speaks of the difficulty he faced while waiting for Henderson to give way, has now moved up from eighth to sixth in the batting order. He drilled a single past short, scoring Alfonzo to tie the game, and the Mets took the lead when Pratt's groundout scored Todd Zeile.</p>
        <p>Joe McEwing delivered the Mets' third hit of the inning, a single that scored Agbayani for a 4-2 edge.</p>
        <p>The Mets added a run in the seventh when Mora hit his second double of the game and scored on Alfonzo's needle-threading single to the right side, one of only seven hits the Mets managed.</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine kept Piazza and Robin Ventura, his Nos. 4 and 5 hitters, out of the game. Ventura, who usually hits fifth, missed the game because of what was described as a sore shoulder; he hurt it diving for a ball on Monday. And Piazza, the club's cleanup hitter, was given a rest, presumably to be ready for the four games against the Braves.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>RICH RODRIGUEZ, signed by the Mets in the off-season, will be earning his money in the minor leagues for the next month. The left-handed reliever is going to Class AAA Norfolk and pitcher ERIC CAMMACK is being brought up.</p>
