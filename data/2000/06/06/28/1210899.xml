        <p>THE summer our grandmother, a ninth-generation Manhattanite, moved down South to live nearer to the family, she brought with her a truckload of sleek, blond mid-century furniture, a closetful of spike heels and a tattered, handwritten recipe for pesto Genoese. The year was 1982, and we had never tasted anything like it. Shining through the richness of Parmesan, pine nuts and garlic was the sunny, uplifting flavor of fresh basil, an epiphany we would forever associate with summer and urban sophistication.</p>
        <p>Or so we thought. Basil is still the quintessence of summer for us, but over the years it has lost its cosmopolitan credentials; every other restaurant in America, it seems, is turning out some pale version of fresh pesto, slathered over grilled chicken or salmon or pizza.</p>
        <p>Then, on a recent spring day at the Union Square Greenmarket, we came across a stall with 11 varieties of basil, with alluring, exotic names: Thai Siam Queen, Purple Ruffles, Mrs. Burns's lemon basil, and lime, cinnamon and holy basils. There were bushy plants with dainty, teardrop-shaped leaves and the pale tone of pea soup standing beside a lanky variety with razor-toothed leaves shot through with purple veins. One basil had the saturated color of inky zinfandel, and broad leaves that were ridiculously frilly at the edges.</p>
        <p>We sampled them all, beneath the wary gaze of the grower, and each bite brought on the excitement and thrill of the new. Suddenly, basil was once again a culinary adventure.</p>
        <p>The cold, wet spring has delayed local harvests by several weeks, but now bundles of exotic basils are beginning to turn up in specialty grocers and farmers' markets around New York.</p>
        <p>These basils really are different from the varieties available year-round. Besides the familiar sweet basil flavor, they have other beguiling flavors and aromas, like warm cinnamon toast, lemon zest, bay leaf, ripe berries, tobacco and clove, to name a few. These are delicate nuances, no matter how pronounced the flavors may be. When you cook with an exotic basil, you have to think about it differently and handle it differently or its distinctive essence will vanish.</p>
        <p>That day at the market, we bought one of each plant, put them in our Harlem community garden plot and, since we weren't patient enough to wait for them to mature, bought even more plants expressly for cooking.</p>
        <p>In fact, the 11 varieties we found represent only a fraction of the number of basils. Eileen Boyle, the director of horticulture at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, ventures that there are several hundred basil varieties among 60 or 70 species in the genus Ocimum, native to India, Africa and Asia.</p>
        <p>A cook can divide them into four flavor categories: the citrusy basils, like lemon, lime or Mexican basil, all as intense as a lollipop and perfect for perfuming sauces. Then there are the anise or licorice varieties -- less assertive than the citrus basils but more complex than the standard sweet basils. These include Thai, Armenian and Holly's Painted basil.</p>
        <p>The spicy basils, like cinnamon, clove or chocolate basil, tend to have flavors that are fleeting, and need to be eaten fresh. Finally, there are the lustrous purple and opal basils. They are generally muted versions of the basic sweet Italian basil; they can add visual spice to a plate, but not a whole lot of flavor.</p>
        <p>Cooking with exotic basils is about preserving the herb's heady, aromatic oils. The vibrancy of these oils makes them seem invincible, but sustained heat will reduce even Mrs. Burns's lemon basil to a shadow of her outrageously lemony self. We had resolved to keep heat to a minimum, and still we slipped up. We coated two small, whole red snappers with a generous rub of kosher salt, ground black pepper and minced lemon basil, then wrapped the fish in a nest of basil sprigs, hoping that a brief blast of heat on the grill wouldn't dent the intense lemon perfume. After just five minutes on the grill, it had faded into dark oblivion.</p>
        <p>So we tried a lemon basil beurre blanc, with a half cup of chopped leaves blended into the sauce once the pan was safely off the flame. It was perfect for the fish, the lemony essence of the basil deftly parting the richness of sauce and fish.</p>
        <p>We also learned that simply substituting a lemon basil or a licorice basil in recipes that call for the standard Genoese won't always work. Flattering their distinctive flavors can be a challenge.</p>
        <p>For instance, cinnamon basil pesto sounded great but lacked the piney, peppery kick of good pesto; the bold synergy of herb, cheese and nut collapsed. Using both basils, in a proportion of one to one, added the mysterious note of cinnamon and sandalwood we were after without upsetting the balance.</p>
        <p>With the most potent basils, like Mrs. Burns's lemon basil or holy basil, merely rubbing a leaf across a surface -- say, of a crisp bruschetta or a fresh fig -- will release enough aroma and flavor to set off visions of lush mountain meadows.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, we also discovered that a discreet twist of lemon peel, a tablespoon of diced fennel or a cinnamon stick can reinforce the character of the herbs without selling them short.</p>
        <p>One sure bet with all basils is to let them shine on their own, in salads: insalata Caprese, the rustic salad of sliced tomato, fresh mozzarella and basil, is a classic formula that can stand up to a zinger, like holy basil. Any green salad can be deepened and intensified with just a handful of whole basil leaves thrown in.</p>
        <p>Our favorite recipe came about from free-association. Our lime basil made us think of a favorite summer nibble: Cuban grilled corn, lightly brushed with homemade mayonnaise and sprinkled with lime juice and queso fresco. We set out to simulate that balance of corn, lime and cheese flavors in a dish that would be a light summer meal. A sweet corn risotto seemed perfect, with a dusting of Parmesan and 40 dime-size leaves of lime basil folded in before serving.</p>
        <p>Basil's tarragonlike, herbal tendencies make it indispensable in savory dishes, but its mint, cinnamon and anise qualities point toward dessert. So we dunked strawberries into a pint of store-bought creme fraiche that we had blended with chopped cinnamon basil. Strawberries and cinnamon? Strawberries and basil? Sounds odd. But it was delicious, not to mention easy, and it performed double duty as a crudite dip when we added salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>We also made more ambitious desserts, after consulting Jerry Traunfeld, the executive chef of the Herbfarm Restaurant in Fall City, Wash., which has acres of kitchen gardens. His book, ''The Herbfarm Cookbook'' (Scribner), was published this spring. The popularity of Genoese basil among his clientele inspired the Basil Banquet, nine courses with different varieties of basil, including cinnamon, licorice and lemon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Traunfeld uses whole leaves in salads and sauces, and with grilled fruit. He drops battered leaves into hot oil for basil tempura, and smokes salmon with ''basil wood,'' the dried stems of basil plants. But the real fireworks are in desserts, like licorice basil and apricot sorbet, and cinnamon basil and blueberry shortcake, that use herb-infused simple syrups and creams.</p>
        <p>''When you infuse,'' Mr. Traunfeld told us, ''you get that wonderful spice flavor and strain out the green vegetal flavors.''</p>
        <p>Following his advice, we plunged whole leaves of basil into a bath of hot cream, steeping them for half an hour. Once the cream was suffused with the herb's flavor, we threw out the leaves and made a superb lime basil and coconut ice cream, and a cinnamon basil chocolate mousse. Chocolate and basil -- perhaps against one's better instincts -- go well together. If you need a validating precedent, note that the Michelin three-star restaurant Arpege in Paris pairs a basil ice cream with chocolate.</p>
        <p>Despite the enthusiasm these basils inspire in chefs and culinary tinkerers like us, they're decidedly unsung and underexposed in American markets.</p>
        <p>They're less durable than supermarket varieties, said Susan Blew of Oak Grove Plantation, a specialist in organic herbs in Pittsfield, N.J., which sells exotic basils at the Union Square Greenmarket all summer long. Ms. Blew begins her basil crop in her greenhouse right after New Year's Day. She scrutinizes January forecasts for a stretch of three days of full sun to allow seeding. If the weather report is wrong, she'll start over again.</p>
        <p>''Basil's like kids,'' she told us. ''They don't like cold and they don't like wet feet.''</p>
        <p>And then there's the matter of distribution. The exotics wilt quickly after picking, so they're more often sold as plants, roots and all, in garden markets rather than in supermarkets. ''If Dean &amp; DeLuca is out of Thai basil,'' one shopper observed, ''I go to Home Depot.''</p>
        <p>Quincy Horan, a Connecticut grower of organic heirloom produce, won't take the chance of shipping bunches of the nine varieties of basil he grows at Waldingfield Farms out of Litchfield County.</p>
        <p>On Long Island, Peconic River Herb Farm, a nursery in Calverton, has solved the delivery problem: fans of exotic basils pick them themselves. In the nursery's 200-square-foot herb garden, you can choose among six varieties, including cinnamon, Thai Siam Queen and Thai Lemon (a basket and clippers are provided; the basils cost 50 cents an ounce, or $6 a pound).</p>
        <p>It takes a good greengrocer -- the sort that partners with local growers and has a sophisticated clientele -- to stock exotic  basils. Among these are Citarella, which has Thai, lemon and cinnamon basil. Gourmet Garage has Thai basil. The Bangkok Center Grocery at 104 Mosco Street, between Mulberry and Mott, has both sweet and spicy Thai basil.</p>
        <p>When you find these basils -- and they  will get easier to find as the harvest peaks in late August and early September -- it's wise to preserve them. Washed and dried leaves freeze well in a sealed plastic container or in a tightly sealed freezer bag. Then, just simply defrost and use them.</p>
        <p>But we prefer to pack basil tightly in a small jar, like those used for baby food or spices, with olive oil and a layer of rock salt at the neck of the jar. Store the jars in the refrigerator and, after each use, top off the jar with a little more rock salt. Leaves near the top may discolor, but will not lose flavor.  Vegetable oil is equally suited to preserving basil and is not as expensive as olive oil, but we find the olive oil becomes infused with the essence of the herbs and is superb -- especially in the first gray days of autumn -- when a drizzle on a slice of apple will transport you back to a warm, slow afternoon. Not a drop is wasted.</p>
        <p>A Summer Full of Fragrant Basils to Grow</p>
        <p>IF you have a small patch of earth (or a sunny windowsill), you can grow basil.</p>
        <p>When you buy it, look for bushy vigorous plants. Leaves may be curled somewhat, but avoid plants with leaves that look closed up, or that have brown splotches. A few flowering tips are a sign of a healthy plant, but too many flowers indicate the plant may be past its peak and turning bitter. Conduct an on-site taste test.</p>
        <p>Plants will usually have more than one stem. Don't separate the stems when you transplant; basil is sensitive to root damage. Plant 10 inches apart (not more than three plants in a 36-inch window box) and trim back older leaves and tips. Water daily, letting plants drain well, and when the plants begin to flower, keep pinching off the flowers to foster growth and to prevent the flavor from turning resinous. Snip leaves with a pair of scissors, cutting just above the point where a leaf branches.</p>
        <p>Pick the midsize leaves on a sprig for the sweetest, most pronounced taste. Topmost leaves are the fruitiest and most fragrant, and perform best in fresh preparations like salads. Older leaves tend to be more bitter.</p>
        <p>There are many good sources for scented basil plants, including the following:</p>
        <p>At the Union Square Greenmarket, Oak Grove Plantation sells about 10 varieties, all organically grown. Plants are $4 each or four for $14. In Westport, Conn., Gilbertie's Herb Farm (203-227-4175) has 13 varieties, including anise, cinnamon, lemon and Sweet Bush, for $2.50 each. Peconic River Herb Farm in Calverton, N.Y., (516-369-0058) sells cinnamon, Thai Lemon and Thai Siam Queen basil and, for true green-thumbs, seedlings ($6 a plant; $1.50 for four seedlings). Chelsea Garden's three Manhattan locations will special-order flats of lemon, Thai and cinnamon basil for $5.99 a plant.</p>

        <p>4. When rice is done, stir in remaining cup of corn kernels, lime juice and remaining  3/4 cup chopped basil leaves. Add salt, pepper and Parmesan to taste.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>CINNAMON BASIL CHOCOLATE MOUSSE  Time: 15 minutes, plus 3 hours' refrigeration</p>
        <p>2 ounces unsweetened chocolate</p>
        <p>1/2 cup sugar  2 eggs, separated  2 cups cinnamon basil whipped cream (see recipe).</p>
        <p>1. In a saucepan, melt chocolate with  1/4 cup sugar and  1/4 cup hot water, stirring until smooth. Beat egg yolks and stir into chocolate. Remove saucepan from heat.</p>
        <p>2. Beat egg whites, gradually adding remaining  1/4 cup sugar, until peaks form. Fold egg whites into chocolate. Fold 1 1/4 cups cinnamon basil whipped cream into chocolate. Pour mixture into ramekins or glasses and chill for 3 hours. Top with remaining whipped cream and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>CINNAMON BASIL-INFUSED WHIPPED CREAM  Adapted from ''The Herbfarm Cookbook''  Time: 45 minutes, plus 6 hours' refrigeration</p>
        <p>24 leaves cinnamon basil  2 cups heavy cream, preferably not ultra-pasteurized  1 2-inch cinnamon stick  2 tablespoons sugar.</p>
        <p>1. Wrap basil leaves in a towel and roll a rolling pin over them once or twice to bruise them slightly. Heat cream over medium-high heat until it begins to boil, stirring constantly so cream does not scald. Add basil leaves and cinnamon stick, submerging them in cream. Turn off heat.</p>
        <p>2. Cover tightly and let sit for a half-hour. Strain, pressing out juice in leaves. Refrigerate until very cold, about 6 hours. Place cold cream and sugar in a mixer and whip until it forms peaks.</p>
        <p>Yield: 3 1/2 to 4 cups.</p>
        <p>CINNAMON BASIL CREME FRAICHE  Time: 5 minutes</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons chopped cinnamon basil  2 tablespoons heavy cream  8 ounces creme fraiche  Sugar to taste  Fresh berries.</p>
        <p>1. In a blender, puree basil with cream. (Or mince basil and mash in a mortar and pestle with cream and a couple pinches of sugar.)</p>
        <p>2. With a spoon, blend mixture thoroughly into creme fraiche. Add sugar to taste. Serve in a bowl, with fresh berries alongside for dipping.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>

        <p>SPRING ROLLS WITH THAI BASIL  Adapted from ''Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone,'' by Deborah Madison (Broadway, 2000)  Time: 1 1/2 hours</p>
        <p>4 ounces rice vermicelli  2 carrots  2 cups mung bean sprouts, blanched briefly  4 cups napa cabbage, finely shredded  8 scallions, first 4 inches quartered lengthwise, then chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 cup cilantro, coarsely chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 cup mint, coarsely chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 cup Thai basil, coarsely chopped  4 cloves garlic  1 teaspoon sugar  4 roasted serrano chiles, peeled, seeded and minced  4 to 6 peppercorns  Juice of 4 limes  12 large rice spring roll wrappers  Rice wine vinegar, soy sauce and red chili paste for dipping.</p>
        <p>1. With a knife, chop rice vermicelli (it tends to stick together in a block) into roughly 2-inch segments. Place noodles in a bowl and pour boiling water over them. Let sit until soft (1 to 2 minutes), then drain through a  fine strainer.</p>
        <p>2. With a vegetable peeler, shave each carrot in thin, two-inch pieces.</p>
        <p>3. In a large bowl, combine noodles, carrots, sprouts, cabbage, scallions, cilantro, mint and basil. In a mortar and pestle, mash garlic, sugar, chiles and peppercorns to a paste. Whisk in lime juice and pour over  vegetable mixture. Toss well so that dressing, vegetables and noodles are evenly distributed.</p>
        <p>4. In a pan large enough to fit rice wrappers, pour water about an inch deep. Submerge a wrapper until soft, slippery and flexible.  Gently remove wrapper and lay it on a clean, damp towel. Place a heaping 1/2 cup of mixture an inch below center of wrapper and pat down. Fold bottom end of wrapper over mixture, followed by each side. Roll wrapped mixture up to top edge, creating a neat package. Place finished roll on a platter lined with a clean, damp towel and repeat until all the vegetable mixture has  been used.</p>
        <p>5. Serve with cruets of rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, and sriracha (red chili paste), so that everyone can make a dipping sauce to taste.</p>
        <p>Yield: 12 large rolls.</p>
