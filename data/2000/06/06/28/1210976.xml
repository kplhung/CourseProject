        <p>Few politicians have been able to resist exploiting public anger over $2-a-gallon gasoline in the Midwest. But none have shed much light on the subject. Vice President Al Gore suspects that oil companies are gouging customers, and he would not mind if voters took revenge on Gov. George W. Bush, a former oil company executive. Mr. Bush accuses the administration of having sat back while OPEC tripled the price of crude oil. He also cites Mr. Gore's book on the environment to suggest that Mr. Gore thinks gas prices are too low to begin with. Others have called for relaxing environmental standards.</p>
        <p>But beyond the accusations lie rather mundane facts. The industry has often been accused of price collusion, but investigations have never turned up evidence. OPEC decisions explain why prices are up nationwide -- but not why they are sky-high in the Midwest. Whatever role environmental regulations have played in boosting gas prices, their impact is temporary and appears to be waning.</p>
        <p>A study by the Congressional Research Service provides rough estimates that supply cutbacks by OPEC have boosted gasoline prices nationwide by about 50 cents a gallon over the last 18 months. Gas prices in the Midwest are about 50 cents higher than that. Approximately half of the gap can be traced to broken pipelines. The other half could be due to a peculiar interplay among various environmental rules and ethanol, a fuel additive.</p>
        <p>To meet provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act, refiners in certain Midwest cities blend ethanol into gasoline to reduce carbon monoxide and toxic chemicals. But ethanol also tends to make gasoline evaporate easily, and in so doing adds to urban smog. In recognition of the smog problem, the Environmental Protection Agency on June 1 imposed updated rules designed to reduce evaporation. This meant the refiners had to figure out anew how to blend ethanol with gasoline in a way that alleviates one air pollution problem without aggravating another. This task, in turn, has complicated production and may have at least temporarily contributed to the shortage.</p>
        <p>Even modest interruptions in gasoline supplies can drive prices upward, in part because refineries hold small inventories and thus have little gas on hand to absorb production drops. But the interruptions, though troublesome, are temporary. They do not justify suspending the June 1 environmental rules that are important to cleaning up the air and have been years in the making. Besides, they are unlikely to raise prices by more than about a nickel a gallon once the system has time to settle down.</p>
        <p>In truth, many scientists now question the need to add ethanol or any other ingredient to gasoline to control carbon monoxide emissions. But this is a matter for Congress to decide, and should not be driven by short-term supply imbalances in the Midwest. Until the Federal Trade Commission completes its current study of the situation, no one will know for sure why gas prices rose above $2 a gallon. But it seems unlikely that the commission will find a single villain.</p>
