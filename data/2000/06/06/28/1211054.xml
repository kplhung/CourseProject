        <p>The Henley Royal Regatta, as much a part of the English social season as it is a part of the international rowing circuit, continues to have a special appeal to American collegiate crews.

        <p>The United States national team, in training for the Sydney Olympics in September, is passing up Henley this year, leaving the United States collegiate entry to carry the load in the 151st rowing of Henley. All 18 finals will be raced on Sunday.</p>

        <p>The Henley Royal Regatta, as much a part of the English social season as it is a part of the international rowing circuit, continues to have a special appeal to American collegiate crews. They make up the majority of this year's overseasentry that begins five days of knockout competition today at Henley-on-Thames, England.</p>
        <p>The United States national team, in training for the Sydney Olympics in September, is passing up Henley this year, leaving the United States collegiate entry to carry the load in the 151st rowing of Henley. All 18 finals will be raced on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Columbia University, which in 1878 became the first American crew to compete at Henley, is represented by its varsity lightweight crew, which won the Eastern Sprint championship by 11-hundredths of a second over Yale on May 20. Yale avenged that defeat two weeks later and claimed the national collegiate lightweight title by finishing six-tenths of a second ahead of Princeton, relegating Columbia to third place.</p>
        <p>Yale and Princeton are at Henley in the same half of the Temple Challenge Cup draw, and should meet in Saturday's quarterfinals. The Rutgers lightweight varsity, Brown's heavyweight freshman crew and Virginia's varsity are also in the Temple Cup.</p>
        <p>California's undefeated varsity heavyweight eight, the national collegiate champion, is1 entered in Henley's second-highest standard eight-oared event, the Ladies' Challenge Plate, as is Brown's Eastern Sprint champion varsity. Cal is the only crew Brown has not defeated this season.</p>
        <p>In what shapes up as an Olympic preview, the British and Australian national eights will contest Henley's premiere eight-oared event, the Grand Challenge Cup. The British won the silver medal behind the United States world champion last year.</p>
        <p>For the first time, Henley has established an eight-oared event for women, the Henley Prize. Washington and Virginia will row in the eight-crew event.</p>
