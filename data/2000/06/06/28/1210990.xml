        <p>Trout fishing on many of the Catskills' blue-ribbon streams has become so crowded in the last year or two, especially on weekends, that it is S.R.O. The trout streams' surge in popularity parallels the rise in fly fishing's growth in America and has also ushered in a new-found economy among these verdant hills. Local entrepreneurs have responded by refurbishing restaurants and motels, adding new tackle shops, museums and a booming guide service.</p>
        <p>The crowded conditions on the better-known streams and pools were succinctly impressed upon me, first and fittingly, on April 1, the opening day of the trout season in New York State. At about 6 a.m. on that day, I was there in Roscoe, N.Y., alias Trout Town U.S.A, standing in a line of anglers on the Route 17A bridge that spans the famed Beaverkill. A hundred yards downstream, it meets Willowemoc Creek and forms the famous Junction Pool.</p>

        <p>Trout fishing on many of the Catskills' blue-ribbon streams has become so crowded in the last year or two, especially on weekends, that it is S.R.O. The trout streams' surge in popularity parallels the rise in fly fishing's growth in America and has also ushered in a new-found economy among these verdant hills. Local entrepreneurs have responded by refurbishing restaurants and motels, adding new tackle shops, museums and a booming guide service.</p>
        <p>The crowded conditions on the better-known streams and pools were succinctly impressed upon me, first and fittingly, on April 1, the opening day of the trout season in New York State. At about 6 a.m. on that day, I was there in Roscoe, N.Y., alias Trout Town U.S.A, standing in a line of anglers on the Route 17A bridge that spans the famed Beaverkill. A hundred yards downstream, it meets Willowemoc Creek and forms the famous Junction Pool.</p>
        <p>I was there because fishing Junction Pool is one of the required rites of spring for all Catskills anglers. The fishermen before me were waiting their turn to jog down the well-worn path on the bridge's west abutment so they could gain access to the well-publicized confluence.</p>
        <p>Forget it! It was standing-room-only on the banks. Even if I were able to get to the water's edge, I'd be shoulder-to-shoulder with other anglers. I drove downstream on old Route 17, which parallels the Beaverkill, looking for a pool with space.</p>
        <p>At one time, you could easily tell the productive spots on the river by the number of cars pulled off the road. The technique still works but the Theodore Gordon Fly Fishers have made life easier for the itinerant angler. At each pool, they've placed sturdy, cast-iron signs, similar to historical markers the state erects. They identify the pools and give a description of why it bears that name.</p>
        <p>I passed Ferdon's, Barnhart's and Hendrickson's pools and Horse Block Run, all packed with cars and anglers. I slowed at Cairn's Pool to tally the number of anglers and lost count after 25. I passed Wagon Tracks, School House, Trestle, Mountain and Lower Mountain pools and stopped at Cemetery Pool. All were filled with anglers. I realized I couldn't fish the Beaverkill.</p>
        <p>I returned on a weekend in mid-May, during ''Bug Week,'' to find the crowding even worse. ''Kind of tough getting to the water, isn't it?'' asked a stocky, wader-clad angler who wore a heavily laden fishing vest and a wide-brimmed hat. He sat down next to me on a newly constructed wooden ramp that led down from the road, via a switch-back, to the water's edge. His left ear was pierced by a silver, metallic trout jumping through the bottom of the lobe.</p>
        <p>''Where's your rod?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>''Never use one when I'm guiding,'' said Rick Miller.</p>
        <p>Miller, 57, was born in Stamford, Conn., but made a beeline for Roscoe when he retired after 30 years in the fire department.</p>
        <p>''Since I was 20, I've been coming here to fish,'' he said. ''In those days, we worked the Golden Triangle. It was composed of the Neversink, Willowemoc, Beaverkill, East Branch'' -- of the Delaware River -- ''Esopus, Schoharie and Roundout. Finding space on a pool was never a problem in those days.''</p>
        <p>Miller built a fishing lodge in Craig-E-Clair, five miles from Roscoe. From there, he guides about 150 days a year. His service has grown so rapidly that during the busier times of the season, he uses several area guides.</p>
        <p>''I saw this coming,'' he said as we watched one of his rods set the hook on a fish. ''For the last three years, I've made a serious effort to inventory the trout fishing in almost every tributary stream in the six counties of the Catskills. I've found that at times fishing on these streams off the beaten track can be as good, if not better, than on the main streams. One thing is sure, the ambience and solitude is well worth the added effort of searching them out.''</p>
        <p>Reluctantly, he disclosed the streams' names but cautioned that on some access is limited, while on others the state has acquired the fishing rights.</p>
        <p>Off the West Branch of the Delaware, they include Little Delaware, Falls, Honest and Elk Creeks and Betty Brook. On the West Branch, they include Read Creek, Baxter, Trout and Downs Brooks, and Batavia and Bush Kills. On the Beaverkill, they include Trout, Horton and Russell Brooks, and off the Willowemoc, Little Beaverkill, Mongaup Creek and Fir Brook. Off the lower Delaware River, there's East Branch Callicoon Creek and Panther Rock Brook.</p>
        <p>If you want to avoid crowds and fish streams off the beaten track, your first task is to get a free map/brochure called ''I Love New York Catskill Fishing.'' It is available at all Department of Environmental Conservation offices and at most tackle shops and motels in the area or can be obtained by calling (800) NYS-CATS. Or you can contact Rick Miller at (800) 884-7088.</p>
