        <p>I'M not usually one for making predictions, but having observed restaurants at the southwest corner of Broadway and 100th Street come and go faster than Italian prime ministers over the last decade, I feel confident that Turkuaz, a Turkish restaurant that opened a few weeks ago, will outlast them all.</p>
        <p>When restaurants fail repeatedly at a single site, it's reflex to describe the spot as cursed. But the only curse at this particular site has been the series of woeful restaurants that have tried to force themselves onto the neighborhood. Most recently it was a bad Asian restaurant. Earlier it had been bad Mexican, bad Southwestern and more than a few bad Italian.</p>

        <p>I'M not usually one for making predictions, but having observed restaurants at the southwest corner of Broadway and 100th Street come and go faster than Italian prime ministers over the last decade, I feel confident that Turkuaz, a Turkish restaurant that opened a few weeks ago, will outlast them all.</p>
        <p>When restaurants fail repeatedly at a single site, it's reflex to describe the spot as cursed. But the only curse at this particular site has been the series of woeful restaurants that have tried to force themselves onto the neighborhood. Most recently it was a bad Asian restaurant. Earlier it had been bad Mexican, bad Southwestern and more than a few bad Italian.</p>
        <p>Turkuaz differs not only because the food is good, but also because it has a clear identity. The dining room, previously a cold, awkwardly long space that was consistently dispiriting no matter what food was being served, is now draped in billowy fabric so that it resembles an Ottoman tent. Seat covers give standard restaurant chairs a lush appearance, and the staff is adorned in traditional Turkish costumes. It's a low-budget makeover, but the payoff is a room transformed.</p>
        <p>Turkuaz has an extensive menu, and I head directly for the cold appetizers, perfect when the going gets steamy and just right with a basket of puffy, fresh-baked Turkish bread. The lineup includes the usual Middle Eastern complement, like creamy hummus ($4.50) and smoky baba ghanouj ($4.50), along with Turkish specialties like patlican salatasi ($6.50), a tangy, garlic-enhanced eggplant puree, and acili ezme ($4.95), a mash of tomatoes, green peppers, onions and walnuts blended with parsley, olive oil and lemon juice and given a pleasant jolt with red pepper flakes.</p>
        <p>I love cacik ($3.95), a refreshing blend of yogurt, cucumbers, garlic, fresh mint and dill that resembles the Greek tzatziki. Turkuaz also serves a variation, haydari ($4.50), made with thicker, creamier yogurt. Shepherd's salad ($5.95), a mixture of chopped tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers flavored with herbs, olive oil and lemon juice, is bright and cooling. I do wish Turkuaz offered a combination platter of appetizers.</p>
        <p>Turkuaz offers, as a light meal, an excellent lahmacun ($3), a wafer-thin, crisp bread topped with well-seasoned ground lamb that is sometimes called Turkish pizza. Playing calzone to the pizza are pides, long, thin, glossy breads that are wrapped around stuffings like air-dried beef and feta ($8.50) or cubes of lamb ($8.50) and then cut into sections.</p>
        <p>Main courses tend to be simple and elementally satisfying, like beyti kebab ($14.50), spicy chopped lamb charcoal-grilled with herbs and garlic, chewy lamb kebabs ($13.50) and tender, well-flavored lamb chops ($17.50). For added complexity, adana yogurtlu ($14.50), a blend of beef and lamb layered with yogurt and tomato sauce over crisp bread, is well put together, while hunkar begendi ($13.50), chunks of lamb in an eggplant puree, is rich and creamy.</p>
        <p>The restaurant does not yet have its liquor license, but it does offer interesting Turkish soft drinks ($2) like refreshing sour cherry juice and soda that tastes exactly like bubble gum. Desserts include the usual baklava ($4) and kadayif ($4), dripping with honey, as well as a neat variation on rice pudding ($3.50), served with the top caramelized like creme brulee.</p>
        <p>Turkuaz is still working out kinks in its service, which tends to be slow, but if I'm permitted another prediction, the problems will be solved. Curiously, the three owners have no previous restaurant experience. Maybe this saved them from making the same old mistakes.</p>
        <p>Turkuaz  2637 Broadway (100th Street), Manhattan; (212) 665-9541.</p>
