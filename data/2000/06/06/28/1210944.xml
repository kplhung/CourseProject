        <p>Even though the unraveling of the human genome is only now being completed, much of the genetic code has already been claimed for commerce. In what has often been compared to a land grab, companies and universities have filed for patents on hundreds of thousands of genes and gene fragments.</p>
        <p>Amid concerns that such patents are being granted too liberally and that they could hinder innovation, the Patent and Trademark Office is about to implement new guidelines that will make it harder to patent genes. But critics say the new rules are still too lax.</p>
        <p>Some opponents say it is a moral affront to patent living things or parts of living things. They argue that a gene is not an invention, but something that exists in nature and should be the common heritage of mankind.</p>
        <p>''The notion that some company has a monopoly on my genes is like claiming ownership of the sea,'' said Jonathan King, a professor of molecular biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>According to the Patent and Trademark Office, however, the law allows patenting of discoveries from nature, like penicillin, if they are isolated and purified by the hand of man. ''From a patent law standpoint, genes are treated just like any other chemical found in nature,'' said Q. Todd Dickinson, director of the patent office. The patent office has now issued patents on 6,000 genes, about 1,000 of them human genes.</p>
        <p>Indeed, genes have been patented for years. Many of the first were for drugs. For example, erythropoietin, for anemia, was made by cloning the gene that coded for that protein. In those early days, scientists knew the function of the protein and worked backward, taking years to isolate a single gene.</p>
        <p>But now high-speed gene sequencing and other techniques are allowing genes or fragments of genes to be discovered en masse, without knowing the functions of the proteins produced by the genes.</p>
        <p>These genes, rather than representing a product in themselves, are guides to future product discovery. And there is concern that granting exclusive rights based on this upstream work would discourage scientists from doing the harder downstream work -- figuring out what the genes do and using the information to treat disease. Some compare it to granting ownership of the alphabet, rather than of a novel or play.</p>
        <p>''You have people who haven't contributed to subsequent discovery being able to lay claim to those discoveries,'' said Rebecca S. Eisenberg, a law professor at the University of Michigan.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, for example, Human Genome Sciences, based in Rockville, Md., was granted a patent on a gene for a protein that turned out to serve as the entryway for the AIDS virus to infect cells. While the company identified the gene as an immune system receptor, its role in AIDS was not discovered until later by other researchers. Still, Human Genome says it is entitled to royalties on any drug that takes aim at this entry portal -- or even to block development of such a drug.</p>
        <p>Some doctors fear that genetic testing of patients could become prohibitively expensive if each gene is patented. Research scientists are already searching for clues to disease by seeing which genes are active in diseased cells. But the chips used to study the matter might become impractical if the rights to each gene had to be licensed.</p>
        <p>Even some big drug companies, which normally preach the importance of patents for spurring innovation, have expressed concern about the ramifications of patenting genes.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert I. Levy, senior vice president for science and technology at American Home Products, calls the gene patenting situation a ''minefield.'' Finding out who owns rights to what takes an increasing amount of time, Dr. Levy said at a health care conference in San Francisco earlier this year organized by Chase H &amp; Q, an investment bank. Royalties paid to holders of patents on genes, research mice and other tools can total 12 to 14 percent of the cost of a drug, he said, making some products uneconomical to produce.</p>
        <p>As a result of these concerns, 10 big drug companies formed a consortium last year to study differences in the genome between one person and another. These differences, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms, or S.N.P.'s, could be important in testing susceptibility to disease. The consortium is putting them in the public domain to prevent other companies from patenting the S.N.P.'s before their function is known. ''It's to ensure we have the basic alphabet,'' said Arthur Holden, chief executive of the consortium.</p>
        <p>Some executives say concerns that innovation will be blocked are unwarranted, pointing out that patents are designed to encourage innovation, not retard it, by giving an incentive to inventors. Also, the contents of patents must be published so that others can learn from them.</p>
        <p>William A. Haseltine, president of Human Genome Sciences, the leading patenter of human genes, said the electronics industry continues to innovate rapidly and reduce prices despite numerous patents.</p>
        <p>Stephen P. A. Fodor, chairman and chief executive of Affymetrix Inc., which makes gene chips, said only one patent holder had refused to allow its gene to be placed on a chip. Most patent holders want people to do research on their genes in hopes of finding a drug, which would bring really big royalties, he said.</p>
        <p>Scientists often make a distinction between the genome itself -- the entire sequence of three billion chemical units in human chromosomes -- and individual genes. It was a confusion between the two that caused the stocks of biotechnology stocks to plummet in March after President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain issued a statement saying the genome should be publicly available.</p>
        <p>White House officials later emphasized that genes themselves, as opposed to the entire genome sequence, should be eligible for patents.</p>
        <p>The crucial issue for patent examiners has been how much of the gene's function must be known to satisfy the requirement that any patentable invention be useful. Until now, companies have filed for patents in large numbers without knowing the functions of many genes, contending that, at a minimum, genes make a protein that can be used as animal feed. The patent office has granted some of these patents.</p>
        <p>Applications are pending for more than half a million fragments of genes, which are known as expressed sequence tags, said John Doll, director of biotechnology at the patent office. Some applications contend that a fragment is useful because it can allow scientists to find the entire gene.</p>
        <p>But in response to criticism, the patent office is raising the bar by requiring that more of the gene's function be known. ''Nobody would go through the time and cost of isolating a protein from a diseased cell merely to put it in dog food,'' Mr. Doll said.</p>
        <p>Under the new guidelines expected to take effect in the next few months, gene fragments will probably not qualify for patents. But fully characterized genes whose functions are known -- like a gene that predisposes women to breast cancer and can be used in a diagnostic test -- will continue to be patentable.</p>
        <p>There is still a vast ground in the middle, consisting of full-length genes whose function is not known for sure but is guessed at by computer analysis. The National Institutes of Health and the National Academy of Sciences oppose patents on these genes but the patent office said some such patents could be granted.</p>
        <p>With the technology in so much flux, Jeremy Rifkin, a critic of the biotechnology industry, has said he plans to file a lawsuit challenging the legality of gene patents. Congress might also revisit the issue. For companies that have staked their futures on owning the rights to genes, and for science in general, a lot is riding on the outcome.</p>
