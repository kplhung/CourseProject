        <p>BESIDES being an accomplished architect, Aydin Boysan is perhaps Turkey's most famous bon vivant. That means, inevitably, that he is a passionate drinker of raki.</p>
        <p>''Raki civilizes society,'' Mr. Boysan said between sips on a recent evening. ''That's very important here, because Turkey is such a huge mess that if we didn't have something like raki, we'd probably become hopeless and all commit suicide. Raki is our only consolation.''</p>
        <p>It is difficult to imagine Turkey without raki. More than simply the national drink, it is a potent, anise-flavored distillation of the Turkish soul. It accompanies much of the best after-dark conversation and is woven inextricably into the country's social fabric.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boysan took his first drink of raki when he was 18 and now, 61 years later, describes it as ''my lawfully wedded wife.'' He worries that two evils imported from the West, bars and cocktail parties, are eroding the raki tradition.</p>
        <p>As long as Turks love life as much as he does, however, it seems in no danger of disappearing.</p>
        <p>''You have to drink it like a gentleman, which of course means never drinking too much,'' he said earnestly. ''All the senses are involved. First, you watch the water being poured into the glass and mixing with the raki. Then, you pick up the glass and inhale the aroma. When you drink it, you take a small sip, feel the pleasure of it flowing down your throat, take another small sip, then put the glass down.</p>
        <p>''The best part is feeling it go down your throat. A giraffe -- that's an animal ideally made to appreciate raki.''</p>
        <p>Raki is clear when poured out of the bottle, usually into tall glasses. The glass is filled about one-third with the liquor. Water is then added, turning the liquid translucently white. That appearance gives it the widely used nickname lion's milk.</p>
        <p>It is unusual to see raki being consumed without food. Most often it is served with the small appetizers called mezes that have been a mainstay of Mediterranean cooking since time immemorial. Most connoisseurs agree that the ideal dish is seafood.</p>
        <p>Records of raki production go back to the early 17th century. Though it is one of Turkey's great passions, in Central Asia, where Turkic tribes originated, there is no tradition of anise-flavored liquor. That tradition is Mediterranean, and Turks adopted it during Ottoman rule over Greece and nearby lands. To this day, Greeks and Turks argue over the relative merits of raki and its Greek counterpart, ouzo.</p>
        <p>Turks claim that the process for making classic raki is more complex. It involves two distillations in traditional copper vats, one using a concentrate made from seedless grapes and the other a special variety of anise. Raki's alcohol content is 45 percent.</p>
        <p>There are three grades, but even drinkers who could easily afford the small premium for the highest grade, Altinbas, say the basic Yeni raki is best. It is cheaper because it is made partly with pure alcohol, while Altinbas and the mid-grade Kulup are made with fermented grapes only.</p>
        <p>The government liquor and cigarette monopoly, Tekel, is the only legal producer of raki. In the countryside there are still producers of bathtub raki, but the relatively low price of the legal stuff -- about $5.75 for a 70-centiliter bottle of Yeni raki -- makes bootlegging a small-scale labor of love rather than a serious business.</p>
        <p>Raki makes its way to the United States, much of it served in Turkish restaurants. In New York a 750-milliliter bottle is sold at Sherry Lehmann, 679 Madison Avenue (61st Street) for $17.95.</p>
        <p>Certainly the most famous of all raki drinkers was Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish Republic, who was born and raised in what is now the Greek city of Thessaloniki. Ataturk died of cirrhosis in 1938 at age 58, and there are countless stories about his fondness for raki.</p>
        <p>''When the Republic was founded, most members of Parliament were very conservative religious figures, and alcohol was illegal,'' said Ali Gok, a manager of Tekel. ''Ataturk used to serve it to his friends at home. They would say to him, 'Pasha, it's great that we can drink when we're with you, but why don't you make raki legal so we can drink it in our own homes?' That made sense to him, and after a while the ban was lifted.''</p>
        <p>According to a new biography of Ataturk, he once asked a dinner guest what goes best with raki. ''Leblebi,'' the guest answered, referring to a dish made from roasted chickpeas.</p>
        <p>''Wrong,'' the great man replied. ''The best accompaniment to raki is good conversation.''</p>
        <p>Drinking raki is indeed a social thing, not something you do alone. ''It's also a macho thing,'' said Dr. Warren Winkler, an American-born physician who has lived in Turkey for nearly 40 years. ''A lot of foreign women who live here develop a taste for it, but not many Turkish women do. You'll see 6 or 8 or 10 or 20 guys sitting around a table drinking without a woman in sight.''</p>
        <p>Although it is quite common to see working-class men drinking raki, many intellectuals also consider it essential to provocative discussion and debate.</p>
        <p>''During the 1950's and 60's, educated people didn't want to drink raki because it was considered too folksy and rural,'' said Ilter Turan, a political scientist who is the rector of Bilgi University in Istanbul. ''It was considered more sophisticated to drink wine or whiskey. But that didn't last long.  Raki has been reinstated as our national drink. It's a sign that Turkey is becoming more comfortable with itself, a recognition that something from our own tradition is not negation of the modernity we're seeking.''</p>
