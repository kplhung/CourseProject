        <p>The safe and logical pick is to go with the sure thing, the player who will help you next season, the power forward from Cincinnati who can block shots, rebound, score inside and fill the void left by the imminent retirement of Jayson Williams. But the latest high school phenom is also available, and in four years, while Cincinnati's Kenyon Martin could be very good, East St. Louis High's Darius Miles could be sensational.</p>
        <p>Do the Nets fill a need with a potential all-star or take a risk with a potential superstar? Rod Thorn, team president, is still deciding.</p>
        <p>''Ten years ago, you wouldn't think about picking a high school guy with the No. 1 pick,'' Thorn said today. ''Six years ago, you wouldn't think about picking a high school guy. When Kevin Garnett went fifth, everybody thought he went too high. Kobe Bryant went 13th. But potential doesn't always make it. That's where it gets ticklish because sometimes guys with great potential realize it and sometimes they don't. So you've got to have a feel for the player and that's what we're wrestling with.''</p>
        <p>The prevailing opinion around the league is that the Nets will select Martin, a powerful and athletic 6-foot-9-inch, 230-pounder, in the National Basketball Association draft Wednesday if they keep the first pick. But Thorn said today that he had not made up his mind. If he does not trade the pick, he said he will take either Martin, Miles or Stromile Swift, a 6-9 forward with the wingspan of a center from Louisiana State.</p>
        <p>The Nets' selection could be the most dramatic moment of the draft. Hours later, the Knicks will make the 22nd pick, and while theirs will not have the intrigue or impact of the Nets' selection, it could be interesting. The Knicks would like to take a power player, and they are hoping that Jamaal Magloire, a 6-10 center from Kentucky, is available. If Magloire is gone, the Knicks may turn their attention to Donnell Harvey, a 6-8 forward from Florida.</p>
        <p>There are some draft analysts who believe the Knicks will select a point guard, and the possibilities appear to be Erick Barkley of St. John's and Speedy Claxton of Hofstra, both native New Yorkers. Lavor Postell, St. John's strong and athletic 6-6 swingman, may also be considered. If the Knicks pass on Barkley or Postell, it will be the second straight season that they bypassed a local favorite. Last season, they used the 15th pick to select a French center, Frederick Weis, instead of Ron Artest, the St. John's forward from Queensbridge.</p>
        <p>General Manager Scott Layden, who is directing his first draft for the Knicks, said the club will not allow the position of a player affect its choice.</p>
        <p>''When you are drafting late you need to keep an open mind for any position,'' said Layden, who had great success with late picks while in Utah's front office. ''Fortunately, our team is well balanced so we're able to take on virtually any position. This is a draft where frankly we are wide open.''</p>
        <p>Miles, who has been endorsed by none other than Michael Jordan, has scouts around the league drooling. A super-thin 6-9 forward, he has been called a smaller version of Garnett. His athleticism is reportedly off the charts, and while he currently lacks range on his jump shot, he is expected to have a tremendous career.</p>
        <p>But while he admitted that Miles has more upside than anyone in the draft, Thorn may still select Martin. With the end of Williams's career being announced before the draft, the Nets need immediate help inside. Martin is a terrific shot blocker with a tenacious attitude, great athleticism and a good post game.</p>
        <p>''This is not like playing in Sacramento, where you get a kid, wait three years and let him develop,'' said Thorn, who has been told by doctors that Martin's broken right leg is no medical risk. ''In the New York area, you have to be ready when you come here.''</p>
        <p>Thorn is still considering the possibility of trading the pick and said two teams recently made intriguing offers. He said any offer would have to include an established player.</p>
