        <p>A LEADING forecaster of advertising spending has raised his estimates for 2000, citing economic conditions that are more robust than he expected as well as strong spending so far this year by marketers in major categories from automobiles to computers to drugs.</p>
        <p>And in a sign that the sustained boom on Madison Avenue shows little likelihood of slowing down -- dot-coms or not-coms -- a preliminary prognostication for 2001 was similarly upbeat.</p>
        <p>''We think these good trends will continue,'' Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann, said at a presentation of his predictions yesterday at the University Club in Midtown Manhattan. ''There is continued strong demand for media time and space.''</p>
        <p>Ad spending is considered a sensitive barometer of the economy, particularly the willingness of consumers to continue shopping as enthusiastically as they have. Though the Conference Board reported yesterday that consumer confidence fell this month from a record in May, the data for the second quarter was the second best ever. That suggested that the consumer spending spree was unlikely to slow significantly.</p>
        <p>''There are legs to the story'' of continued sustained ad spending growth, said Karen R. Ficker, a managing director at ING Barings in New York who attended Mr. Coen's presentation.</p>
        <p>In addition to the categories cited by Mr. Coen, which also included alcoholic beverages, brokers and mutual funds, restaurants and resorts, Ms. Ficker said she expected big increases in ad spending in ''emerging categories'' like wireless and hand-held devices that ''are going to need to brand themselves to differentiate themselves.''</p>
        <p>In his presentation, which Mr. Coen makes twice a year, he predicted that ad spending this year in the United States would total a record $235.6 billion, up 9.4 percent from a revised figure of $215.3 billion spent in 1999.</p>
        <p>The 1999 figure was an increase of 6.8 percent from the $201.6 billion spent in 1998 -- and was ''very good for an odd-numbered year,'' Mr. Coen said, that did not have the stimulative effects of elections and the Olympics. Those events are of course adding to the projected increases for 2000, along with special campaigns with millennium themes.</p>
        <p>An increase of 9.4 percent this year would be the largest percentage gain since 1984 -- also a year of Olympics and elections -- when ad spending climbed 15.8 percent.</p>
        <p>The estimate yesterday was the second time that Mr. Coen, who has been following ad spending trends since 1948, had raised his 2000 forecast. His first prediction, made in June 1999, was for an increase of 7.5 percent; six months later, he revised his outlook to an increase of 8.3 percent.</p>
        <p>''The economic expectations are considerably brighter for 2000 than they were in December,'' Mr. Coen said, primarily because many advertisers ''are posting phenomenal increases'' in ad spending.</p>
        <p>National ad spending this year is now expected to rise 11.1 percent, to $141.9 billion, compared with Mr. Coen's estimate in December of 9.1 percent to $139.2 billion.</p>
        <p>Local ad spending, however, is now expected to rise 7 percent, to $93.8 billion, rather than 7.1 percent, to $93.9 billion. Mr. Coen attributed the slight decrease in his estimate to ''a weak performance in retail'' advertising in newspapers.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Coen's latest estimates for 2000 prove right, ad spending as a percentage of gross domestic product would reach a record 2.4 percent, compared with 2.33 percent in 1999 and 2.3 percent in 1998.</p>
        <p>That pleased another analyst attending the presentation, Leland A. Westerfield of PaineWebber in New York, who has theorized that ad spending may be breaking out from historic norms. Until now, Mr. Westerfield said, when ad spending reached or exceeded 2.3 percent of gross domestic product, it would drop back down below that rate.</p>
        <p>''There's no one else who can bring 50-plus years of economic observations to his forecasts,'' Mr. Westerfield said, ''which provides a large measure of credibility when Bob says advertising can outpace G.D.P. growth.''</p>
        <p>If advertisers cooperate with Mr. Coen's initial estimate for 2001 -- $251 billion, an increase of 6.5 percent from his adjusted forecast for 2000 -- ad spending next year would amount to 2.42 percent of projected gross domestic product.</p>
        <p>Turning to ad spending abroad, Mr. Coen was also optimistic, citing expected gains in several countries that account for about two-thirds of all spending outside the United States, among them Canada, France, Germany and Italy.</p>
        <p>Spending overseas should total $229.2 billion, Mr. Coen said, an increase of 7.2 percent from a final total of $213.8 billion for 1999, which has been adjusted downward from earlier estimates of $216.3 billion. The revised total for 1999 marked a gain of 4.2 percent from $205.2 billion spent abroad in 1998.</p>
        <p>For 2000, then, Mr. Coen's worldwide total estimate is $464.8 billion, up 8.3 percent from his final figure of $429.1 billion for 1999. That would be the biggest one-year percentage increase since 1995, when worldwide ad spending rose 11.5 percent. The final 1999 figure represented an increase of 5.5 percent from the $205.2 billion spent in 1998.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead to 2001, Mr. Coen said that ad spending abroad would reach $247 billion, up 7.8 percent from his revised forecast for 2000; that would also be the biggest one-year percentage increase since 1995.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Coen's worldwide total estimate for 2001 is $498 billion, an increase of 7.1 percent from his projected total for 2000.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't quite juggle those percentages to get to $500 billion, half a trillion,'' Mr. Coen said, laughing.</p>
        <p>One audience member at the presentation suggested with a smile that if Mr. Coen was ''worried about getting to $500 billion,'' he should raise his estimate for online ad spending, now set at in 2000 of $3.4 billion, up 75 percent from 1999. (Actually, Mr. Coen had; the figure he projected in December was $3.2 billion.)</p>
        <p>As for dot-com spending in the traditional media, which may decline if more e-commerce companies close or conserve cash to remain afloat, Mr. Coen was sanguine.</p>
        <p>''If two of these companies lose their ability to buy traditional media,'' he said, ''10 more can fly in to replace them.''</p>
        <p>Universal McCann, where Mr. Coen works, is the media services division of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising. That agency is part of the McCann-Erickson World Group, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
