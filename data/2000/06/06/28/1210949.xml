        <p>YOU could get lost in the Carnegie Hall warren of Vincent La Selva, conductor, creator, artistic director and phone answerer of the New York Grand Opera.</p>
        <p>There are stacks of orchestrations; racks of costumes, secondhand of course. There is also a dusty photo of a weather-beaten statue of Giuseppe Verdi, which stands on a little scrap of park at Broadway and 73rd.</p>
        <p>''I did a concert there,'' Mr. La Selva, 70, is saying. ''I even had my singers clean that statue. It looked terrible; it was dirty, it had pigeon fallings all over it. I wheeled an upright piano there, got four singers and gave a concert. Then we got buckets and brushes and cleaned Verdi's statue.''</p>
        <p>One cannot recall hearing of a conductor who scrubs down a statue. Also, a question: Why not clean the statue before the performance?</p>
        <p>''It's easier to sing first, then work, than to work and get up and sing.''</p>
        <p>Do not be led astray by the name of the New York Grand Opera Company -- grand, in the usual sense, it is not. It does not have a permanent home; the costumes and scenery are worn; the members of the chorus are often very young or very old, as if there had been a war in opera land and the great tenors had been taken away. And yet the company, which has given over 150 performances since its creation in 1973, often garners fine reviews.</p>
        <p>It is also doing what Mr. La Selva and his fans believe to be a first:  presenting all 28 operas composed by Verdi in the order in which they were written. Mr. La Selva began the project in 1994. This evening, the company will perform ''Un Ballo in Maschera,'' opera No. 23. Mr. La Selva plans to finish the program next summer, on the 100th anniversary of Verdi's death.</p>
        <p>The program has not been done elsewhere because it does not make sense financially. The Grand Opera, which is financed by grants, is without those concerns. The musicians work for scale, as does Mr. La Selva, earning $1,200 or $1,300 for conducting the Central Park season. For operating the company, he earns nothing.</p>
        <p>''It's not that I don't want to get paid, it's just there's never enough left over for me.''</p>
        <p>The absence of money, is this the leitmotif in the conductor's life? Telling you about his background, Mr. La Selva explains that the west side of Cleveland was not where the money was -- the money was on the east side of town. His father, an Italian immigrant, worked in a wire-weaving factory.</p>
        <p>Mr. La Selva starts playing trumpet at age 8; by 14 he is working neighborhood beer gardens and strip joints for $1 a night. He wants to be Harry James, but in high school a teacher introduces him to conducting and the obsession is born.</p>
        <p>Mr. La Selva comes to New York and works his way through Juilliard.  Later, he organizes the Xavier Symphony, performing for seven years out of St. Francis Xavier Church in Manhattan. He takes no salary. Mr. La Selva is by this time married, to Helen Daniels Lovell, a former singer. They have two children. Eventually, there will be three. How does he survive?</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure,'' Mr. La Selva says, after giving it some thought.</p>
        <p>TIME to call the wife, at the real estate office in New Jersey where she works.</p>
        <p>''We often wonder: how did we live?'' she says, quite cheerfully. ''I think he had a drum student and a trombone student, but what could they have paid him? We lived in the Ansonia Hotel up to the time when they raised our rent. So we came out to New Jersey, to Montclair, and found a whole house for $250 a month. Somebody lent us the money to pay the first month's rent. ''</p>
        <p>She didn't consider divorce?</p>
        <p>She laughs.</p>
        <p>''The trouble with Vincent is money is the last thing on his mind. Actually, it's his most endearing quality. Once, I was meeting him at Seventh Avenue and 57th and we ran into Jean Morel; he was conducting at the Met. He said, 'Oh, you're the wife. Well, just remember one thing: Music, one. You, two.' Maybe a lot of women would have run like banshees, but I knew that.''</p>
        <p>In 1965, Mr. La Selva makes his professional debut with the New York City Opera. His reviews are good, but for some reason, Mr. La Selva does not go on to have a great career with an established company. Ask him why, and he crosses his arms across his chest and insists he doesn't know.</p>
        <p>''I can take a beating. My whole life has been that. I believe in music and creating great music. That's what keeps me going.''</p>
        <p>Now Mr. La Selva teaches at Juilliard and runs his own company. The operas are part of summer in the city; sit down at the Summerstage with the skyline as your backdrop and the moon as your chandelier and listen. So what if the acoustics fail, or the wind blows away the top of a set, or the maestro conducts in a white dinner jacket that suggests better days and is driven to the performance not by limo, but by his wife, from Jersey?</p>
        <p>Says the conductor:</p>
        <p>''Verdi had a great line. You know what he said? When things get really tough, you put your hand over your heart and keep going.''</p>
        <p>Says the wife:</p>
        <p>''We can be driving home, talking about the day, the children. All of a sudden I see the hand go up and he's conducting something. He's hearing something. It's the music, it's going on in his head all the time.''</p>
