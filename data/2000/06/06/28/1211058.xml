        <p>Pokemon, it seems, may not be immune to children's very rapid aging process, in which 1.5 adult years can be equal to, say, 86 kiddie years.</p>
        <p>Following the fizzles of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers crazes, there are signs that the appetite for all things Pokemon, once considered insatiable, is starting to subside.</p>
        <p>One bellwether: quarterly ratings figures released yesterday show that viewership is shrinking for ''Pokemon,'' the cartoon show based on the Nintendo video game that runs at various times throughout the week on the WB network.</p>
        <p>According to the latest figures, the audience for the show's flagship broadcast on Saturdays at 10 a.m. was 1.8 million strong during the second quarter of 2000, down by nearly 1 million viewers from the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Likewise, the household audience for the 9 a.m. Saturday showing of the cartoon was down by nearly 1 million viewers compared with its February debut in that time slot. Ratings for the 4 p.m. weekday broadcasts were off a bit as well.</p>
        <p>One thing WB executives can tell their sponsors is that the second quarter includes some of those lazy days in June when school is out and youngsters are soaking in the sun rather than the cathode rays of the television.</p>
        <p>Yet the show did not have the same sort of audience declines for from the first to second quarters in 1999.</p>
        <p>That is delighting executives at other networks that run children's programming, especially Nickelodeon, the cable channel that had held first place on Saturday mornings for two years until ''Pokemon'' came on strong in the fall and helped WB take it over.</p>
        <p>But with the show's decline, Nickelodeon's ''Rugrats'' has reclaimed its place as the No. 1 show in children's television, returning Nickelodeon to its former state of Saturday morning glory.</p>
        <p>Executives at WB said they believed that they had nothing to fear and that ''Pokemon'' would continue to show strength.</p>
        <p>On July 21 Warner Brothers will release the second Pokemon movie. When the first feature was released last year, it did extremely well and helped the entire Pokemon franchise. The WB executives said that they believed the same thing would happen this year and that the film would help their ratings into the fall.</p>
