        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I just finished reading R. W. Apple Jr.'s delightful and informative article (''Toque and Dagger: The Sauce Secrets of Worcester,'' June 21). I was surprised he didn't mention that at least in Britain, the sauce is called simply Worcester (pronounced wooster) sauce, even though the label reads Worcestershire Sauce. It's a lot easier to say.</p>

        <p>And sadly, the ingredients are not the same the world over. I was disgusted to find on my latest bottle of Lea &amp; Perrins, made in Fair Lawn, N.J., that sugar has been dispensed with in favor of high-fructose corn syrup, a substitution that makes products traditionally prepared with pure sugar less bright in taste. Fortunately, the American-made Lea &amp; Perrins still tastes pretty good.  JOEL M. WOLDMAN  Alexandria, Va.</p>
