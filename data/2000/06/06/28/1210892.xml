        <p>''That's why people lie, out of necessity,'' says Judith (Heather Matarazzo), the clear-eyed protagonist of Lisanne Skyler's entrancing ''Getting to Know You.'' The movie, which opens today at the Film Forum, is based on Joyce Carol Oates stories and conjures an alluring spell of mistrust and hope, getting to the self-deception that Ms. Oates's characters often weave for themselves.</p>
        <p>Ms. Matarazzo's Judith -- her face a conglomeration of angles and rounded curves with a hint of a dimple in her cheek -- is stuck in a bus station with her older brother, Wesley (Zach Braff). The squabbling between the siblings, who have that way of getting on each other's nerves as only a brother and sister can, is an honest outcropping of their defense mechanisms.</p>
        <p>The easygoing Judith, with her clear blue eyes, has a friendly streak of curiosity in her, compared with the closed-off ambition of her brother, who pursues his studies as if school were a one-way ticket out of his misery. Judith's interest leads her to Jimmy (Mark Weston), who claims to know her from school.</p>
        <p>Judith and Wesley have been essentially abandoned by their parents, Trix (Bebe Neuwirth) and Darryl (Mark Blum), a pair of former ballroom dancers. These self-absorbed failed performers play-act at being a grown-up couple; they have turned their marriage into dinner theater.</p>
        <p>''They don't talk much about the future or us, just themselves,'' Wesley observes as he and his sister hide on a staircase while their parents float across the living room of a house from which they will probably soon be evicted.</p>
        <p>The soured practicality of these children, who have become like a married couple as they fend for themselves, is chilling and, like many of the details in ''Getting to Know You,'' is underplayed.</p>
        <p>Judith and Jimmy have their own sort of game, making up stories around the lives of other people at the bus station.</p>
        <p>Ms. Skyler has woven her film from Ms. Oates's strains of self-deception and fear of betrayal. In doing so, she strikes a note of hope. And even though it's the kind of hope that comes out of a delirium, it's still more than one might feel the right to ask for.</p>
        <p>The hope comes across in the giddiness of her actors, who take to the material with welcoming arms. Ms. Skyler doesn't pursue the modest, petty desperation Ms. Oates can traffic in. The director supplants it with the neediness of small-time dreamers, offering people who can feel better about themselves only by loving others. She makes the ache in Jimmy and Judith all the more real because they're creating these bus-station scenarios, like a pair of Scheherazades in a treehouse.</p>
        <p>In one of these stories, which function as subplots, Irene (Tristine Skyler, the director's sister) falls for Sonny (Chris Noth), a gambler whose surface confidence is a magnet to her. The story unfolds almost as fully in Irene's big, expressive brown eyes as it does through action and dialogue. When Sonny's luck goes cold and his depressive side emerges -- Mr. Noth is better at the low notes than the high ones -- Irene feels his downturn more deeply than he does and wants to help.</p>
        <p>Lisanne Skyler has cast her actresses well. Audiences who have seen Ms. Neuwirth only as the emory-board Lilith from ''Frasier'' and are unaware of how fully she can use her dancer's body will experience the elation she feels through movement. Her Trix refuses to allow Judith and Wesley to call her Mother or Mom and is slightly nonplused at the concept that these tall strangers came from her. She uses them more as an audiences than anything else, and she turns mean at the idea of their growing up and leaving her.</p>
        <p>''Getting to Know You'' is the kind of independent movie that tests the system, because it's missing the cramped, high-concept, low-budget pushiness that makes many small films the bargain bin equivalent of studio pictures. Ms. Skyler's patience and skill reveal themselves in a number of small, gratifying ways. The vivacious color scheme contrasts with the plangent emotional tone, most noticeably in the bus station; it takes on life beyond just a framing device. She's not only a filmmaker, she's truly a director.</p>
