        <p>Congress is scheduled to vote Wednesday on a constitutional amendment that would allow foreigners to invest in the country's media companies, ending a prohibition that has lasted for 66 years.</p>
        <p>If the amendment is passed, Brazil's media companies would be one step closer to the financing they need to keep up with technological advances that are revolutionizing print and broadcast businesses elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''These are investments that will make the growth and development of the whole industry possible,'' said Paulo Machado de Carvalho Neto, vice president of the Brazilian Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters.</p>
        <p>The amendment, which has been circulating in Congress for the last two years, has broad-based support.</p>
        <p>It would allow foreigners to own up to 30 percent of the capital of radio and television stations, newspaper and magazine publishers.  Opposition groups, including unions and leftist parties that are normally against foreign investment in important Brazilian industries, have been largely mollified by the relatively low investment that will be permitted and a clause that prevents foreigners from assuming any control over editorial content.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the amendment would let Brazilian companies for the first time own 30 percent of radio and television stations and 100 percent of publishing houses. The current wording of the constitution allows only Brazilian-born private citizens to own media outlets.</p>
        <p>Brazil's media regulations date to 1934, when post-World War I nationalism spurred the government to enact laws that would protect the country from what was then considered undue influence by foreign powers. A succession of military leaders kept the legislation in place through the 1970's and 1980's. By the time Brazil's government and economy started loosening controls on business in the 1990's, media groups were already hampered by high lending rates and large debts with nowhere to turn except to other wealthy individuals.</p>
        <p>Since media groups are all privately owned, the exact indebtedness of the industry is unknown, but the information that has found its way into the market suggests deep-seated financial problems.</p>
        <p>''In many cases, companies have a high level of indebtedness, outstanding debts with the government and with the social security system,'' said Haroldo de Britto, an economist at Goes &amp; Consultores, a consulting firm in Brasilia. ''In some cases, they are almost buried.''</p>
        <p>Although there was some concern about whether Congress would have enough members on the floor this week to vote on the amendment in light of the impending winter recess, there was little doubt that it would eventually be passed. Media companies are already starting to navigate through a breach in the law by selling off interests in their online publishing ventures. Organizacoes Globo, the leading Brazilian media company, recently sold a 30 percent stake in its online news portal Globo.com to Telecom Italia for $810 million, while Universo Online, an internet news and entertainment portal owned by publishing companies Folha Group and Editora Abril, is planning an initial public offering.</p>
        <p>Essentially betting that the amendment will pass, the country's media giants are preparing for the future. Editora Abril, which publishes more than 200 magazines, including the world's fourth-largest newsweekly, Veja, already audits its finances as if it were a public company in preparation for the opening of the market. Globo, which, along with the Folha Group, started the country's second national business newspaper, Valor Economico, earlier this year with an initial investment of $50 million, has already announced that it is actively seeking foreign partners to bring content and capital to the publication. Globo also has plans for an initial public offering as early as next year.</p>
        <p>The country's smaller media outlets are likely to gain the most from changes in the law. Brazil has more than 3,000 radio stations, most of them independent and suffering from a shortage of funding. With the help of the new legislation, the radio stations are expected to consolidate into chains that would have stronger financial potential to improve technology and offer wider coverage.</p>
        <p>''We have seen this development in the United States and elsewhere,'' said Mr. Machado de Carvalho Neto of the broadcasters association. ''If you begin to value the industry, it winds up creating a positive situation for the businesses, the investors, and principally, the public.''</p>
        <p>Smaller television networks, which see advertising revenue and credit availability suffer under the shadow of the TV Globo empire, will also gain more access to capital.</p>
        <p>''We need technological know-how to be able to accompany the process of digitalization that will reach us in three or four years,'' said Flavio Cavalcante Jr., director at SBT Television, one of the major national network channels. ''This demands a huge amount of resources. We want to have the option to form a partnership with an international company at some time in the future.''</p>
