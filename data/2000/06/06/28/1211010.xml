        <p>Larry Kelley, the Yale end who won the Heisman Trophy as college football's top player in 1936, was found dead at his home in Hightstown, N.J., yesterday of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was 85.</p>
        <p>''It appears to be a suicide,'' a Mercer County assistant prosecutor, Angelo Onofri, told Reuters.</p>
        <p>A niece, Pat Hullfish, said last night in a telephone interview that Kelley's body was found during the morning by his wife, Mary Ruth.</p>
        <p>Kelley sold his Heisman at auction in December 1999 for $328,110 to the owners of a sports bar and restaurant. He had suffered a stroke seven months earlier and his wife was also in ill health.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to right my affairs and my estate and take care of my 18 nieces and nephews,'' Kelley said then. It was the second Heisman to be sold. O. J. Simpson's 1968 Heisman was auctioned for $230,000 in February 1999.</p>
        <p>Kelley was the first player to win a formal Heisman Trophy, the award named for the former player and longtime coach John Heisman. The award was first presented in 1935, to Jay Berwanger of the University of Chicago, but was known then as the Downtown Athletic Club Trophy.</p>
        <p>In the six-decade history of the Heisman, only three schools have produced back-to-back winners. Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis of Army won the award in 1945 and 1946 respectively, and Archie Griffin of Ohio State won it in 1974 and 1975. The school that first had consecutive winners was Yale -- Kelley and then running back Clint Frank.</p>
        <p>In his senior season, Kelley caught 17 passes for 372 yards -- in an era dominated by the running game -- to lead Yale to a 7-1 record. And he had been the only player for Yale, Harvard or Princeton -- the Big Three -- to score a touchdown in each of his six games in the Ivy rivalry.</p>
        <p>His wife is his only immediate survivor.</p>
