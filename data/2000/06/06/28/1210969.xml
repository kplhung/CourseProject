        <p>FOR Carl Cohn, the path to educational innovation began a decade ago on a gritty Long Beach street when a few dozen children, caught in the middle of a gang shootout, were forced to the floor of a school bus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohn was a former truant officer in this heavily industrialized port city adjacent to Los Angeles, and in the wake of that lawlessness he was asked to head an antigang task force. Its principal aim was, like that of some United Nations peacekeeping missions, to protect noncombatants, known elsewhere as primary school students.</p>
        <p>''We needed to give safe passage for students through some very tricky terrain,'' said Mr. Cohn, now the superintendent of schools here. ''We realized the way to make it visible who the students were was clothing, uniforms. We didn't think about all the other issues. It was safety, pure and simple.''</p>
        <p>It was an unusual start for what came to be hailed as a major step in helping to reinvigorate public education, not just here but across the country.</p>
        <p>In 1994, Long Beach mandated uniforms at all its elementary schools after trials at a couple of schools. Test scores and grades rose. Absenteeism, failures and discipline problems declined. Schools in more than 35 states have now adopted uniforms policies, with Philadelphia set to adopt such a policy this fall.</p>
        <p>But it is worth recalling the sobering origins of that success as Long Beach takes the next step, completing the introduction of uniforms at its first high school. The school district that helped push school uniforms to the front lines has now pulled them back, if slightly, as a tool.</p>
        <p>Woodrow Wilson High School, to which students must apply for entry, has phased uniforms in one year at a time, and next year, students in all grades will be wearing khaki bottoms and burgundy or white collared shirts. But a visit to the school and conversations with administrators, parents and students reveal a subtle appreciation for the limitations as well as the merits of uniforms.</p>
        <p>For one thing, if uniforms mean uniformity, these are a failure. The school allows the students to fulfill the requirements in many ways. They can wear trousers, skirts, baggy shorts or capri pants on the bottom and a range of tops on condition they are white or burgundy and have collars.</p>
        <p>Jon Meyer, the school's co-principal, said the administrators chose loose standards to allow older students to express themselves while minimizing the potentially divisive effects of dress, like designating gang affiliation or economic differences. He is even toying with eliminating a rule requiring students to keep their shirts tucked in in the classrooms.</p>
        <p>The point, Mr. Meyer said, is that they have found uniforms just one of several tools for refocusing the school, and, he insisted, they require complete support by parents and students.</p>
        <p>'It's not the answer, but it contributes,'' he said. 'I don't think that the uniform alone does a whole lot, actually.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, there have been improvements. Three years ago, the school had 861 suspensions. This past year, there were 280.</p>
        <p>And that is not just because the school began a policy three years ago that students apply to get in. Despite that, the student body still represents a cross section of the city. Well over a half of the students come from families with incomes below the poverty line, said Keith Hansen, the assistant principal, and 350 of the students speak English as a second language.</p>
        <p>But the real issue is that uniforms were just the most visible of several reforms introduced. Students are required to take more credits, including four years of a foreign language, math, science and English. They must maintain a C average.</p>
        <p>Noelle Ebright, who will begin her senior year at Wilson in the fall and was the student government president last year, said of uniforms, ''They aggravate me more than they help me.'' But she added that they appeared to have cut down on the number of fights.</p>
        <p>Richard Flanary, a senior administrator at the National Association of Secondary School Principals, in Arlington, Va., said the limited amount of research on the subject had placed only modest emphasis on uniforms as a way of turning around a troubled high school.</p>
        <p>''There is no direct link between uniforms and performance,'' Mr. Flanary said, ''but we know there is a link between the school environment and performance. Uniforms might be one way of affecting the environment, but just one.''</p>
        <p>Still, even with their expectations moderated, Long Beach officials are believers, if well-informed believers.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, it's a very good question as to whether 5 or 7 years from now uniforms will still be a priority,'' Mr. Cohn said. ''There is a part of me that says if we really want to grow these young people into young adults, it is, in fact, their behavior that will really mark them, not what they wear.</p>
        <p>''Having said that, these are difficult times. And there is the reality that there is something to be gained if these young people spend less time paying attention to their dress.''</p>
