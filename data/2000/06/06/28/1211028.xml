        <p>The Army has ended an unusually public review for its account, with ad spending estimated at $95 million annually, by hiring a new lineup of agencies led by Leo Burnett Worldwide in Chicago, part of the B Com3  Group.</p>
        <p>The review began in January when the Army expressed dissatisfaction with the incumbent agency since 1987, Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising in New York, and unexpectedly decided not to exercise a one-year renewal option clause in a long-term contract. Two months later, Y.&amp; R. Advertising decided not to take part in the review, which narrowed down to Burnett and Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>

        <p>The Army has ended an unusually public review for its account, with ad spending estimated at $95 million annually, by hiring a new lineup of agencies led by Leo Burnett Worldwide in Chicago, part of the B Com3  Group.</p>
        <p>The review began in January when the Army expressed dissatisfaction with the incumbent agency since 1987, Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising in New York, and unexpectedly decided not to exercise a one-year renewal option clause in a long-term contract. Two months later, Y.&amp; R. Advertising decided not to take part in the review, which narrowed down to Burnett and Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>The Army contract with Burnett, announced yesterday at the Pentagon, is for one year with three one-year renewal options, and for the first time will partly tie the agency's compensation to the Army's recruitment success. Unhappiness grew with Y.&amp; R. after the Army failed to meet goals for enlistees, who have been harder to find as the economy improves and young men and women seek jobs in the private sector.</p>
        <p>In addition to Burnett, the Army hired three agencies for specialized tasks. Images U.S.A. in Atlanta will handle marketing aimed at African-Americans, which had been at the Chisholm-Mingo Group in New York. Cartel Creativo in San Antonio will handle marketing aimed at people who speak Spanish, which had been handled by the Bravo Group in New York. And Starcom U.S.A. in Chicago, also a B Com3  unit, will handle media services, which had been at Media Edge in New York. Like Y.&amp; R. Advertising, Bravo and Media Edge are owned by Y.&amp; R. Inc.</p>
