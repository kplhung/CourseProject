        <p>As Hafez al-Assad, absolute ruler of Syria for 30 years, slipped into a final coma several days before he died on June 10, his closest circle of aides and advisers worked swiftly behind the scenes in Damascus to ensure that his untested 34-year-old son would have a smooth, well orchestrated ascension to power.</p>
        <p>That steady, swift march continued today as that son, Bashar al-Assad, was, not unexpectedly, approved unanimously by Parliament as the sole candidate for President in a referendum scheduled for July 10.</p>
        <p>His father regularly won such referundums by an official tally of 99.9 percent, and there is little likelihood of voter drop-off.</p>
        <p>The speaker of Parliament paused a second or so before declaring the result of the show of hands, followed by cheers and chants.</p>
        <p>Dr. Assad had already, in rapid succession, been promoted from army colonel to lieutenant general -- his father's rank -- and commander in chief, elected leader of the ruling Baath Party by acclaim at its first congress in 15 years and leader of its ruling Regional Command Council, all in the last 16 days.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the only thing that slowed the bandwagon was the eagerness of Syrian officals to climb aboard. A parliamentary committee delegated to study his candidacy on Sunday found him overwhelmingly qualified, and he was scheduled to be anointed in a session on Monday night. But so many lawmakers -- about 200 of the 250-member assembly -- wanted to speak in his praise that the voting had to be rescheduled for today.</p>
        <p>The late president, one delegate declared, made Syria ''the envy of all the world.'' To his son the delegate pledged, ''We shall march behind you with absolute loyalty and sincerity.'' Another called him a ''knight, who will lead us day to day.''</p>
        <p>There was momentary consternation on Monday when one member objected to a constitutional change put through in 15 minutes after the president's death that lowered the age for president to 34, not coincidentally the age of the son. The lawmaker who objected was shouted down and later apologized.</p>
        <p>Hafez al-Assad was known as a very careful planner, and the pieces have been put into place in the last two years as his son was put in charge of Syria's domination of Lebanon and given more and more responsibility for governing at home.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important, last year he was put in charge of an anti-corruption drive that purged a number of high-ranking politicians and generals who might have turned into challengers.</p>
        <p>Among the once-powerful figures no longer on the scene as a result is former Prime Minister Mahmoud Zubi. After 13 years as prime minister and several more as speaker of Parliament, Mr. Zubi was reported to have committed suicide last month as security forces surrounded his villa after accusations that he was corrupt.</p>
        <p>Gen. Hekmat Shehabi, who had been the army chief of staff, fled the country rather than face a graft investigation.</p>
        <p>The member of his father's old guard who appears to be most protective and supportive of Bashar al-Assad is the defense minister, Gen. Mustafa Tlas. He arranged at least two meetings for senior military officers to get to know the young man and has been by his side at many of his public appearances since the president's death.</p>
        <p>General Tlas's son, Manaf, is said to be one of Dr. Assad's closest friends and has been introducing him to members of the country's Sunni Muslim merchant class in an apparent attempt to broaden his base of support. Manaf Tlas commands a battalion in the elite Republican Guard, a mainstay of the late president's support, as does Dr. Assad's younger brother, Maher. Mr. Tlas's brother-in-law, Asef Shawkat, is the director of security and military intelligence. Another important supporter is Bahajat Suleiman, director of internal security.</p>
        <p>The support of the military and the dozen or so overlapping intelligence agencies, which were central to his father's rule, will also be crucial to the new president's survival. Many key security positions are held by Alawites, who like the Assad family are members of a once-poor minority sect risen to power. It did not pass unnoticed that Mr. Zubi was a Sunni Muslim and so is General Shehabi.</p>
        <p>Dr. Assad was training in London as an ophthalmologist until his older brother, Basil, a charismatic soldier and athlete who was the heir apparent, died in a car crash in 1994. Michael C. Hudson, director of the Center for Arab Studies at Georgetown University, recalled meeting Dr. Assad at a computer convention and described him as shy, studious and ''apparently a genuinely nice guy.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Hudson, who happened to be in Damascus at the time of President Assad's funeral, said Dr. Assad must ''thread his way through minefields of potential opposition as he moves to build his own power base,'' warning that the anticorruption drive could be a two-edged sword.</p>
        <p>''Dozens of other high officials are vulnerable to similar charges,'' Dr. Hudson said. ''They must already be strategizing about how to curb this possibly dangerous young man.''</p>
        <p>While the plan to bring the young man to power appeared well orchestrated, said Fawaz A. Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Sarah Lawrence College, Dr. Assad's most urgent task is ''not only to gain legitimacy and consolidate power, but also to keep the military-security ruling elite united.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Gerges said that in the coming months, it will be crucial for Dr. Assad to build ''a coalition of like-minded lieutenants who fully support him, as well as to manage wisely and decisively rivalry among the elite that might spin out of control.''</p>
        <p>A measure of the speed with which the old guard is moving to consolidate itself around Dr. Assad is that the election date has been set well before the end of the traditional 40-day Muslim period of mourning, which would be July 20.</p>
        <p>Some of the shifting political alliances could be seen in the appointments to the 21-member regional command, the Baath Party's ruling body. Among those joining General Tlas and Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam, who promoted Dr. Assad to general and commander, are Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara and Prime Minister Mohammed Mero, new members who appear to be part of an established core of support for Dr. Assad.</p>
        <p>Another major new appointment is of Saeed Bkhaitan, a close aide of Dr. Assad who is now director of the National Security Bureau, which coordinates party and government bodies.</p>
        <p>Several formerly important generals have been eased into retirement and lost their political positions in recent months.</p>
