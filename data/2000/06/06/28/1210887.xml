      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The British conductor Andrea Quinn, who takes over as the music director of the New York City Ballet in August of next year, brings some clear attributes to the job: youth, dynamism, solid musicianship, long involvement with 20th-century music and a wealth of pragmatic experience as the music director of the Royal Ballet in London. The City Ballet orchestra musicians, who were involved in the selection process, are said to be excited by the appointment. And Ms. Quinn, 35, who has been a guest conductor with City Ballet, is eager to join it full time.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Quinn would not be accepting the post were the orchestra of City Ballet not in the midst of a turnaround. Last fall, a bruising strike by the musicians exposed longstanding problems with the quality of the  orchestra's playing and the commitment of its members, who, it was felt by City Ballet's management, had been abusing a privilege, endorsed by their union, that allowed them to send substitutes to rehearsals and performances.</p>
        <p>The settlement reached in December required stricter attendance, and the beneficial results are already apparent. Of course, more work needs to be done. For the last two years the company has been searching for a successor to Gordon Boelzner, the music director for 41 years, who has been ill. During this period the orchestra has played under a frustratingly large number of guest conductors.</p>
        <p>Over all, dance critics have noted an improvement in the musicians' playing during the season that closed on Sunday, an assessment that this music critic and ballet fan can second on the basis of three recent performances at the New York State Theater. Ms. Quinn will be walking into a situation that has gone from almost impossible to very promising.</p>
        <p>Given the traditional relationship of music to dance in ballet, the work of a ballet company orchestra can seem musically thankless. Matters of tempo, phrasing and structure must yield to the demands of the choreography. Even the accepted protocols of ballet audiences must be frustrating for the musicians. Excited fans think nothing of vigorously applauding a fancy turn by a dancer in the middle of a performance.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the repertory of the City Ballet is notably diverse and demanding, a legacy of George Balanchine, its artistic director for 35 years and the most musically sophisticated choreographer in the history of ballet. Of some 100 active works in the repertory, about 30 are scores commissioned by the company from composers as different as Igor Stravinsky and Wynton Marsalis. On top of this, many of the scores the orchestra performs are well known as concert pieces, like Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta, employed by the choreographer Christopher d'Amboise for his new ballet ''Triptych,'' which received its premiere on June 7.</p>
        <p>It is unfair to attend this ballet expecting the orchestra's performance of the score to rival the classic recorded accounts by Fritz Reiner, Pierre Boulez and other great conductors. That said, too many players in the orchestra reacted to the challenges and frustrations of the situation by treating City Ballet as if it were just another gig.</p>
        <p>That a musician might need to miss a rehearsal or performance for personal reasons is understandable. But the absentee rate had grown disturbing. In performance, conductors routinely faced rows of players they had never seen. Regular orchestra members were repeatedly missing dates to accept less distinguished but more lucrative work elsewhere.</p>
        <p>When the contract came up for renewal, the company wanted the situation changed. The players, represented by Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, argued that they were already maintaining acceptable professional standards. But the numbers alone, not to mention the often poor playing, told a different story. Significantly, on the night the strike began, on Nov. 23, 22 of the 62 musicians in the pit would have been substitutes.</p>
        <p>If the musicians had counted on a groundswell of support from the public, or at least indifference, they were mistaken. Their absenteeism made no sense to the parent accustomed to schlepping a child to mandatory play rehearsals or soccer practices in the name of instilling work ethics.</p>
        <p>A few City Ballet players exacerbated the situation in remarks to the news media, chiding the public for its lack of understanding about the ways of professional musicians. One prominent orchestra member explained that substitutes at rehearsals carefully marked in the individual scores the conductor's instructions so that when the regular musician turned up for the performance he or she would know what to do.</p>
        <p>This was absurd. The words ''Take time'' scribbled over a measure are no more indicative of how a passage should be played than the printed score itself, which is, after all, just a blueprint for a performance that must be worked out in direct consultation during rehearsals.</p>
        <p>There were signs that the musicians had lost public respect when the City Ballet decided to use a recording of ''The Nutcracker'' to back up its dancers. Understandably, many patrons were upset. But a significant majority of ''Nutcracker'' fans did not seem to care.</p>
        <p>The strike was settled on Dec. 7.  The players pledged that during the ballet season (23 weeks at the State Theater and three weeks in residence at Saratoga, N.Y.), the City Ballet would be their primary orchestral responsibility. They also agreed to attendance rules that compel them to meet roughly three-quarters of the rehearsal and performance commitments.</p>
        <p>Finally, either the principal or the associate principal of each section (first violins, clarinets, etc.) must be in attendance, along with a minimum number of total players per section. This is to ensure that, for example, all three regular trumpet players in a particular piece are not missing. All told, although the players have clearly made concessions, the rules still permit reasonable flexibility.</p>
        <p>The changes have already made a palpable difference. The playing has been stronger, and not just in matters of execution and accuracy. There is a general sense of a collective ensemble and involvement.</p>
        <p>On a recent Sunday afternoon the orchestra gave an effective account of Bach's Double Violin Concerto in D minor, the score to Balanchine's 1948 ''Concerto Barocco.'' The playing was not flawless, but the undulant rhythmic drive of the music came through, and the violin soloists -- Guillermo Figueroa, the concertmaster, and Nicolas Danielson, the associate concertmaster -- played ably. This performance was just one component of a musically demanding program that included Mr. Figueroa as soloist in Prokofiev's seldom-heard Violin Concerto No. 1 in D, the score for Jerome Robbins's ''Opus 19/The Dreamer.''</p>
        <p>The concerto, composed when Prokofiev was just 26, is a structurally elusive and episodic work with an often fitful solo part. If Mr. Figueroa's playing lacked a degree of polish and control, certainly that was related in part to the demands of playing from the pit with a mind to the needs of the dancers in this intricate ballet. But the dramatic impact and rueful tone of the music came through strongly.</p>
        <p>The program concluded with the ''Brahms-Schoenberg Quartet,'' Balanchine's 1966 ballet using Schoenberg's elaborate orchestral transcription of Brahms's Piano Quartet in G minor. The orchestration is thick, complex and quite fancy, with multiple winds and brasses and a large battery of percussion instruments. In his scoring Schoenberg tries to enhance and project every harmonic nuance and instrumental color in the original chamber work. It would be a challenging score for the New York Philharmonic, and this performance was sometimes tentative and shaky. But under the company's principal conductor, Hugo Fiorato, the contours and character of the music were always evident. The playing seemed to inspire some electrifying dancing.</p>
        <p>Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta, the score for ''Triptych,'' is obviously new to the players, and in a recent performance  they seemed to be feeling their way. Still, this was an honorable account of a difficult score. The opening movement, a great, slow-moving, inexorable fugue for strings, lacked textural definition: the contrapuntal writing is supposed to be murky, but not amorphous. Yet the second movement, the driving Allegro, with its stuttering dance rhythms, had energy and flair. The percussion colors in the static third movement were vivid; and the orchestra captured the rhapsodic quality of the final movement.</p>
        <p>Of course, one listens to music differently at the ballet. A favorite Balanchine maxim was ''See the music, hear the dance.'' And whatever the Bartok performance lacked in strictly musical terms, it did provide a sense of what Balanchine meant. In the second movement, as the piano and percussion instruments pounded out the theme of the first movement fugue, which is recalled in staggered, jabbing chords, there onstage in Albert Evans's leaps and thrusts the music came alive as it seldom does in a concert hall.</p>
        <p>The most auspicious performance came on another recent evening when Ms. Quinn took the podium for ''Symphony in C,'' the classic 1948 Balanchine ballet to the score of Bizet's ebullient youthful symphony. This is a repertory staple at City Ballet, but it's hard to imagine that the orchestra ever played it with more zest and style than on this occasion. And, watching Balanchine's elegant choreographic illustrations of the music, one could hear the symphony with a new and exciting awareness.</p>
        <p>Just as the orchestra players deserved criticism for years of sloppy work and for arrogance during the strike, they deserve praise for the turnaround they have begun and their renewed commitment. Much remains to be done. The special demands placed on a ballet orchestra make it more important, not less, that there be consistency in work habits and personnel. But things seem to be changing. Ms. Quinn could not be coming at a more fortuitous time.</p>
