        <p>About half of all 15-year-olds in the African countries worst affected by AIDS will eventually die of the disease even if the rates of infection drop substantially in the next few years, the United Nations reported yesterday.</p>
        <p>And if infection rates remain high, the odds are that more than two-thirds of the 15-year-olds will die from AIDS in countries like Botswana, according to projections from Unaids, a joint United Nations program in Geneva.</p>
        <p>''The world has never before experienced death rates of this magnitude among young adults of both sexes across all social strata,'' Unaids said in a report released ahead of the 13th International AIDS Conference, which begins on July 9 in Durban, South Africa.</p>
        <p>It is Unaids's second comprehensive report on the global epidemic of AIDS. The first report was published two years ago in conjunction with the last international AIDS conference, in Geneva. That report painted a bleak picture of AIDS, showing one in four people were infected in some parts of Africa.</p>
        <p>The projections were calculated from surveys showing H.I.V. infection rates that have been conducted within various countries. The researchers built statistical models that took into account from current infection rates the odds that a 15-year-old would acquire H.I.V. in his or her lifetime. In countries like South Africa and Zimbabwe, where at least a fifth of the adult population is H.I.V. infected, AIDS would eventually kill about half of all of those who are now 15 years old.</p>
        <p>The new report brings this picture into a sharper, grimmer focus. More new infections are occurring through heterosexual sex simply because the chances of an uninfected individual encountering an infected partner have become higher, Unaids said.</p>
        <p>But the report contained glimmers of hope. Infection rates have fallen in a small number of places, showing that health officials are not powerless in stopping the epidemic.</p>
        <p>In the new report, Unaids calculated for the first time the impact of AIDS on young people, the individuals who are most often infected by H.I.V., the AIDS virus. H.I.V., which has been spread primarily through heterosexual sex in Africa, is wiping out many households, decimating other families, destroying national economies and killing off so many teachers that it is undermining the delivery of basic education, Dr. Peter Piot, the head of Unaids, said in a telephone news conference from Geneva.</p>
        <p>But most people with H.I.V. do not know they are infected because testing for H.I.V. is not widely available in Africa, said Dr. Noerine Kaleeba, a Ugandan who is a Unaids official.</p>
        <p>H.I.V. infection rates are more than five times as high among African teenage girls as among teenage boys, largely because young girls have sex with older men, who are more likely to be infected. Also, girls are much more likely to be infected during vaginal intercourse with an infected partner than are the boys. As men age, their infection rate approaches that of women.</p>
        <p>The infection rates in sub-Saharan Africa are far greater than any expert or computer model had predicted 10 years ago, Dr. Piot said.</p>
        <p>The result is an unusual demographic pattern in which a population includes as many 60-year-olds as 40-year-olds instead of the usual pattern of fewer older people. The United States Census Bureau predicts that in Botswana, there will be more adults in their 60's and 70's than in their 40's and 50's, assuming that H.I.V. infection rates do not change.</p>
        <p>The ferocity of the AIDS epidemic in Africa is such that its ravages thus far will seem minor compared with what lies ahead unless affected countries make AIDS control programs a national priority and other nations contribute much more money for prevention and care, Unaids said.</p>
        <p>The estimated $300 million in international support this year pales compared with the $2 billion needed each year in sub-Saharan Africa alone, Dr. Piot said.</p>
        <p>He also said, ''It's time we make the connection between debt relief and epidemic relief, because one reason that many developing countries cannot invest enough in AIDS prevention is that they have to pay such a high proportion of their national budget'' for debt.</p>
        <p>On an encouraging note, Dr. Piot said 19 years of experience with AIDS has generated important insights into how to reduce the impact of the epidemic. More young people are delaying first sexual intercourse, decreasing numbers of partners and using condoms more often, he said.</p>
        <p>Uganda has dropped off the list of the top 16 infected countries because its government, which was the first in Africa to recognize the danger of AIDS to national development, has promoted broader education and use of such measures to lower its infection rate to 8 percent, from 14 percent in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Zambia may follow Uganda's lead. Its infection rates have fallen in recent years in its capital, Lusaka, where far fewer young women were having sex before marriage in 1996 than in 1990.</p>
        <p>Senegal has stabilized its H.I.V. infection rate at less than 2 percent.</p>
        <p>Protecting another generation of young people from premature illness and death is the greatest leadership challenge for many countries. That requires a nationally driven agenda, the report said.</p>
        <p>While the H.I.V. rate has stabilized in the United States and other developed countries at a fraction of 1 percent, it exceeds 10 percent in 16 African countries. Among developed countries, Portugal's rate of 0.7 percent and the United States's rate of 0.6 percent are the highest, said Dr. Bernhard Schwartlander, a principal author of the Unaids report.</p>
        <p>In virtually any country where 15 percent or more of all adults are currently infected with H.I.V., at least 35 percent of 15-year-olds will eventually die of AIDS, Unaids said.</p>
        <p>The 16 African countries and their infection rates are: Botswana (35.8 percent); Swaziland (25.25 percent), Zimbabwe (25.06 percent), Lesotho (23.57 percent), Zambia (19.95 percent), South Africa (19.94 percent), Namibia (19.54 percent), Malawi (15.96 percent), Kenya (13.95 percent), Central African Republic (13.84 percent), Mozambique (13.2 percent), Djibouti (11.75 percent), Burundi (11.32 percent), Rwanda (11.21 percent), Ivory Coast (10.76 percent), and Ethiopia (10.63 percent).</p>
        <p>In South Africa, the country with the largest number of people (4.2 million) living with H.I.V., the infection rate has jumped to 19.9 percent from 12.9 percent two years ago.</p>
        <p>Rates of infection and an understanding about how H.I.V. is transmitted vary greatly within a country. In Carletonville, South Africa, nearly 60 percent of women 15 to 24 years old were infected. But only 40 percent of men or women knew that an individual can be H.I.V.-infected for many years, yet appear healthy.</p>
        <p>Infection rates are creeping up in West Africa. In addition to Ivory Coast, which is 15th highest, Nigeria, the most populous country in sub-Saharan Africa, has reached a 5 percent rate.</p>
        <p>Two countries in the Caribbean -- Haiti and the Bahamas -- have worse epidemics than any other country outside of Africa. In Haiti, more than 5 percent of adults are infected and in the Bahamas, the rate is more than 4 percent.</p>
        <p>AIDS has made inroads in Asia, but it is not clear whether rates will explode to rival those in Africa and when that might occur, Unaids said.</p>
        <p>In India, where only 7 adults in 1,000 are infected, 3.7 million people were living with H.I.V. at the beginning of this year. The total number in India is second largest in the world, behind South Africa. In India some states show almost no infection while other states have reached adult H.I.V. prevalence rates of more than 2 percent.</p>
        <p>Injecting drug users have transmitted H.I.V. to their wives and girlfriends through unprotected sex.</p>
