        <p>The United States women have become accustomed to dramatic finishes but never before have they had to rely on something as obscure and unsatisfying as a coin toss.</p>
        <p>But that is how it was determined tonight that the Americans had won group play over Brazil in the Gold Cup tournament after Kristine Lilly had a penalty kick saved in the 90th minute of a scoreless tie before 16,386 at Foxboro Stadium.</p>
        <p>Both teams had scored 19 goals and given up none in their two previous matches in round-robin play, so after tonight's tie they resorted to a fourth tie breaker, the coin toss, which was implemented instead of the preferred resolution of overtime or penalty kicks.</p>
        <p>Sissi, the Brazilian captain, called tails, but the coin came up heads, which means the Americans won group play with a 2-0-1 record.</p>
        <p>The United States will now likely face Canada on Saturday in the Gold Cup semifinals in Louisville, Ky., while Brazil (2-0-1) will play China. The final will be played here next Monday.</p>
        <p>The Americans had an inviting chance to win in the 90th minute when Brazil's Formiga was called for a foul for undercutting Julie Foudy as she jumped for a Brandi Chastain pass in the penalty area and they were awarded a penalty kick.</p>
        <p>Lilly scored confidently in the upper left corner as the Americans won the 1999 Women's World Cup on penalty kicks over China, but tonight she placed a soft shot to her right. The shot lacked any pace and Brazilian goalkeeper Andreia made a diving save. ''I did the thing you're not supposed to do: I changed my mind,'' Lilly said. ''That was a big mistake.''</p>
        <p>In this replay of the World Cup semifinals, which the United States won, 2-0, the Americans dominated from the beginning, outshooting Brazil by 18-8, but could never score. Lilly, the world's most experienced international player, had several tempting chances. In the 11th minute, she blocked a clearing pass by Brazil's Tania, chested the ball toward the goal and spun a shot that nicked the post. At the end of the first half, her left footer from 19 yards was deflected by Andreia off the crossbar.</p>
        <p>Brazil's best chance came in the 81st minute when forward Katia, who scored seven goals in an earlier match against Trinidad and Tobago, got behind Kate Sobrero and launched a low line drive that goalkeeper Siri Mullinix deflected with a sliding save. Mullinix continued to play superbly in replacing the injured Briana Scurry, roaming frequently and aggressively.</p>
        <p>''It was odd that it didn't go into overtime or P.K.'s,'' Mullinix said.</p>
        <p>Overwhelmingly, that's what the American players would have preferred, to keep playing.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen it,'' Coach April Heinrichs said of a coin-toss resolution. ''We've always talked about what a disaster it is to decide a game like that. When you invest so much emotionally and physically, you want to get the benefit of a win.''</p>
        <p>Foudy, the American captain, said the tie felt like a loss. She said she was not quite sure what was happening as she and Sissi stood at midfield for the coin toss. After the coin came up heads, and the Americans advanced as group champions, Foudy did not react at all, simply walking back to her teammates.</p>
        <p>''How can you celebrate a coin toss?'' she said. ''We're happy with the way it turned out, but you want to win. You don't want a tie or a coin toss.''</p>
