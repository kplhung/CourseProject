        <p>President Jacques Chirac of France urged Germany today to join France in spearheading a core group of European Union countries that would move faster than others toward political and economic union.</p>

        <p>President Jacques Chirac of France urged Germany today to join France in spearheading a core group of European Union countries that would move faster than others toward political and economic union.</p>
        <p>''Those countries that want to proceed further with integration, on a voluntary basis and in specific areas, must be allowed to do so without being held back by those who, with every right, do not want to proceed as quickly,'' Mr. Chirac said in a speech to the German Parliament.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac cited the new European currency, the euro, as an example of a success achieved with only 11 of the 15 European Union members taking part.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac's speech was intended to be the high point of a two-day visit here proving that the French-German ''motor'' was still vigorous despite what has seemed like a cooling of the relationship in recent years.</p>
        <p>But his speech was seen here as the beginning of what is likely to be a long and heated debate about the future of the European Union. Last month, Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, suggested that a European federation with a directly elected president and a parliament sharing real executive and legislative powers was needed for the union to function effectively.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fischer's plan, put forward as his personal opinion, brought a harsh reaction from France's interior minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement. At first, Mr. Chevenement said the proposal showed that Germany had yet to recover from the ''derailment'' of Nazism and still wanted to restore a sort of Germanic Holy Roman Empire. He later apologized for some of his remarks.</p>
        <p>But the fact that Mr. Fischer spoke out at all was widely applauded in some quarters. As the European Union is poised to take in a dozen new members in the next few years, there is a wide consensus that its institutions must be overhauled or face paralysis. But there has been little public discussion.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Chirac hinted at his position when he told reporters that he hoped for a ''united Europe of states rather than a United States of Europe.'' Today, in his speech at the Reichstag, the first there by a foreign head of state since its renovation, Mr. Chirac maintained that theme.</p>
        <p>''Our nations are the source of our identities and of our roots, '' he said.  ''The diversity of our political traditions, cultures and languages is one of the strengths of the union. In the future, our nations will stay the first reference point for our people.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Chirac conceded that much work needed to be done to ensure that the union continued to function and grow. He called for clarifying lines of authority and for allowing majority voting instead of unanimity on most issues, and he endorsed the weighting of member states' votes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac also endorsed the drafting of a European constitution.</p>
        <p>He emphasized, however, that he did not believe that there was any need for a new treaty. And he said that nation states had to remain the core of the union. ''Neither you nor we envisage the creation of a European superstate that would take the place of our nation states and end their role as actors on the international stage,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac's idea of letting some union countries go ahead with reforms that others are not inclined to or ready for is a controversial one. Some countries fear that it could create a two-tier system, with some nations' having second-class status.</p>
        <p>France is to take over the rotating presidency of the European Union  this weekend and has set an ambitious agenda, including agreement on many of those reforms by December. Germany has expressed support for that aim. But Germany wants a second intergovernmental conference before 2004 over the power-sharing issue, a move that some experts believe could lead to foot-dragging this year.</p>
