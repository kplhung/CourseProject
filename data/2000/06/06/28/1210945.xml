        <p>The police here have detained an accused terrorist who is linked to the network of Osama bin Laden and to an Islamic fundamentalist cell in Canada that plotted to bomb American buildings, an investigator said.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Abdelssalem Boulanouar, a 34-year-old Frenchman of Algerian origin, was arrested when he arrived on Saturday after being deported from the Philippines, where he had served a six-month sentence for possession of explosives, according to an investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>He is believed to have close ties to Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian arrested in December at the border with Canada with bomb material in his car. Mr. Ressam, whose trial is to begin in July in the state of Washington, is accused of plotting to blow up American buildings and faces up to 130 years in prison.</p>
        <p>The two men are part of a group led by Fateh Kamel, an Algerian veteran of the Afghan war against the Soviet Union, that kept apartments in both France and Montreal, the investigator said. Three years ago, they raised money through armed robberies in northern France and planned to bomb a meeting of the Group of 7 industrialized nations. The French police learned their names from personal phone books found in raids, but much of the group scattered.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boulanouar apparently went to the Philippines, where he has links to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which is fighting to create an Islamic state there and is thought to be behind a spate of bombings. Mr. bin Laden, the Saudi-born millionaire suspected of masterminding the 1998 bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, is thought to pay for the training camps used by the Moro Front and its rival, the Abu Sayyaf group. The latter is now holding about 20 foreign hostages.</p>
        <p>Under French law, proof that Mr. Boulanouar was a member of a terrorist cell could be enough to jail him for 10 years, the source said. The French police do not believe that he is a suspect in the Kenya and Tanzania bombings or in the plot to bomb American buildings.</p>
