        <p>Spurred by two pharmaceutical companies that want to take their cholesterol-lowering medications over the counter, the Food and Drug Administration is considering whether many more medicines -- from antibiotics to birth control pills -- should be made available without a doctor's prescription.</p>
        <p>Beginning with public hearings on Wednesday and Thursday, the drug agency will re-examine the way it regulates over-the-counter drugs, the first such review in nearly three decades. The last one, in 1972, created a new system for approving over-the-counter drugs that enabled more than 600 drugs to switch from prescription to nonprescription status.</p>
        <p>Typically, nonprescription drugs treat mild conditions, like headaches, colds and athlete's foot. But now, in addition to looking at infection-fighting agents and oral contraceptives, the agency is raising a new question: whether patients with chronic conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and osteoporosis, should be able to treat themselves.</p>
        <p>''We are open to the possibility of having more and different kinds of medicines available to consumers,'' said Dr. Robert DeLap, the agency official leading the review.</p>
        <p>''The health care environment has changed tremendously in recent years,'' Dr. DeLap said. ''People are much more interested in self-care, and in being able to manage their minor conditions themselves.''</p>
        <p>But what constitutes a minor condition is a matter of debate, and some drug safety experts worry that broadening access to medications will only harm patients, enabling them to take drugs in dangerous combinations. And in making more drugs available without a prescription, the drug agency could greatly affect the $100 billion pharmaceutical industry, changing the dynamic of who pays for medicines and how much they cost at a time when these issues are at the center of the political debate in Congress.</p>
        <p>Nonprescription drugs are generally cheaper than prescription drugs, and also save money on doctors' visits. The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents nonprescription drug manufacturers, says consumers save nearly $13 billion a year by using over-the-counter medicines that were once available by prescription only. But while these drugs cost less, patients, and not insurance companies, must pay for them.</p>
        <p>Agency officials said they are not certain whether or when any regulations will change, but the review is already generating controversy.</p>
        <p>In all, 55 people are scheduled to testify at this week's hearings, including drug and insurance company officials, safety advocates, infectious disease specialists worried about antibiotic resistance and abortion opponents, who are fighting an over-the-counter birth control pill, which taken in high doses can be used as a morning-after contraceptive.</p>
        <p>''Anytime you tamper with the health care system, you run into very emotional responses,'' said Steve Francesco, a consultant who advises the drug industry on changing drugs from prescription to nonprescription status. ''The F.D.A. is saying let's throw a rock in this pond and see where the waves move. I think that's very courageous, and long overdue.''</p>
        <p>One case in point is Claritin, the best-selling allergy medication, which last year generated $2.3 billion of its $2.7 billion in sales from the United States. Claritin is available in other countries without a prescription, and Blue Cross of California has petitioned the drug agency to give it over-the-counter status.</p>
        <p>A switch would inevitably force the drug's maker, Schering Plough Corporation, to lower Claritin's price, to make it competitive with other over-the-counter antihistamines, and the company opposes it. But health insurers, like Blue Cross, would benefit from such a move because they would no longer have to pay for the medication.</p>
        <p>The drug agency typically does not make a drug over-the-counter unless the manufacturer requests it. But as the agency reopens the issue of over-the-counter drug regulation, the Claritin debate is generating fears within the industry that the longstanding policy will change.</p>
        <p>''Pharmaceutical companies have the most detailed knowledge of their drugs, and they should decide when to make the switch,'' said Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, a trade group. ''Economics should not play a role.''</p>
        <p>But economics does play a role. ''What's at stake here is money, and control and safety,'' said Matthew Weinberg, an industry consultant.</p>
        <p>Before 1972, the F.D.A. did not formally review all over-the-counter drugs for safety and effectiveness. That year, the agency began to set standards for the 300,000 to 400,000 nonprescription drugs that were already available; drugs that met those standards were permitted to remain on the market. But new medicines had to submit to a formal review by the agency.</p>
        <p>In the years since, a range of medicines, from Rogaine for hair loss to Aleve for pain to Monistat for vaginal yeast infections, have switched from prescription to over-the-counter status.</p>
        <p>Now regulators must consider whether to add cholesterol-lowering medication to that list. Next month, the drug agency is scheduled to convene a panel of scientific experts to evaluate applications from two drug manufacturers, Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb, to make low-dose versions of their anti-cholesterol pills available without a prescription.</p>
        <p>Merck's request comes a year before the patent on its drug, Mevacor, is due to expire; in seeking to market a 10-milligram dose without a prescription, financial analysts say Merck is trying to build brand loyalty and increase profits before a generic equivalent goes on the market. Mevacor's United States sales dropped to $480 million from $593 million from 1998 and 1999.</p>
        <p>The Bristol-Myers Squibb drug, Pravachol, does not face patent expiration until 2005. In submitting its application to the F.D.A., analysts say, the company is trying to compete with Merck.</p>
        <p>Officials at both companies cast the discussion in terms of patients, not profits. They argue that consumers who are not being treated for high cholesterol would benefit from easy access to their drugs.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, who as director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, an advocacy organization, is a frequent critic of the drug agency, said it would be both ''dumb and dangerous'' to permit cholesterol-lowering pills to be sold without a doctor's orders.</p>
        <p>Unlike a patient who has a headache, Dr. Wolfe said, a patient with high cholesterol may not have symptoms. A test is needed to detect the problem, he said, and a doctor is needed to interpret that test and follow the patient to make certain the cholesterol condition does not deteriorate into a case of serious heart disease. The drugs also have the potential to cause liver damage.</p>
        <p>For those reasons, some financial analysts are skeptical that the drug agency will approve the Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb requests.</p>
        <p>If cholesterol sounds like a thorny issue, consider oral contraceptives. Women's health advocates are expected to argue that the ''morning after pill,'' which is used for emergency contraception, should be made available over-the-counter.</p>
        <p>But abortion opponents have flooded the drug agency with letters arguing against any change that would make the birth control pill readily available to teenagers.</p>
        <p>Some have suggested that the agency follow Canada's lead, and create a category known as ''under-the-counter'' drugs. These drugs do not require a prescription but cannot simply be picked up off store shelves. Instead, the pharmacist would control access, acting as a buffer between consumers and potentially dangerous medications, said Dr. Raymond Woosley, chairman of the pharmacology department at Georgetown University. ''That is a classification we have not had in the past,'' Dr. Woosley said, ''and I think it is one we should be discussing.''</p>
