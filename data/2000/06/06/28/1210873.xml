        <p>OF all the seasons, summer demands the most of its beverages, requiring refreshment as well as lightness and balance. You could drink a heavy Chateauneuf-du-Pape or a tannic cabernet sauvignon with a hearty roast, but who would want to? The first rule of summer drinking is not to work up a sweat doing it. And that's where prosecco comes in.</p>
        <p>Prosecco, a crisp, light-bodied sparkling wine produced in the Veneto region of northeast Italy, is a perfect summer aperitif. It's winsome and light in alcohol, generally around 11 percent, as slim and stylish as an Italian motor scooter. You might not want prosecco at a wedding or on New Year's Eve; it doesn't have the depth of Champagne. But freed from the burden of heavy expectations and pretensions -- and price, for that matter -- it exists simply to please.</p>

        <p>OF all the seasons, summer demands the most of its beverages, requiring refreshment as well as lightness and balance.

And that's where prosecco comes in.</p>
        <p>Prosecco, a crisp, light-bodied sparkling wine produced in the Veneto region of northeast Italy, is a perfect summer aperitif. It's winsome and light in alcohol, generally around 11 percent, as slim and stylish as an Italian motor scooter. You might not want prosecco at a wedding or on New Year's Eve; it doesn't have the depth of Champagne. But freed from the burden of heavy expectations and pretensions -- and price, for that matter -- it exists simply to please.</p>
        <p>Prosecco is produced from the white prosecco grape, which is also used to make still wines, though you rarely see them in the United States. Most of the sparkling varieties are labeled Prosecco di Valdobbiadene or Prosecco di Conegliano, two of the prime prosecco areas in Veneto. A small percentage of prosecco is called frizzante, meaning it is lightly sparkling with a soft texture, which I find particularly attractive. But most proseccos are spumante, or fully sparkling, positively frothing compared with the frizzante wines. Incidentally, the more famous Asti Spumanti, the sweet sparkling wines from the Asti region, are made from the muscat grape, not from prosecco.</p>
        <p>Naturally, not all proseccos are created equal. It's easy to find insipid versions that are either too sweet or too dull. But the following proseccos, all nonvintage and spumanti unless labeled otherwise, are just right for relaxed summer evenings, when the world is your hammock and the most difficult problem is deciding whether to roll over.</p>
        <p>BELLENDA VITTORIO, COL DE LUNA, FRIZZANTE: $10  Bready aroma, zesty, lightly fizzy and delightful.</p>
        <p>. . .  RUGGERI &amp; C., PROSECCO DI VALDOBBIADENE: $14  Aromas of lemons, apples and anise; crisp and fresh.</p>
        <p>. . .  BISOL DESIDERIO &amp; FIGLI, PROSECCO DI VALDOBBIADENE, CREDE: $16  Aromas of peaches and peppermint; off-dry yet refreshing.</p>
        <p>. . .  COLLALBRIGO BRUT, PROSECCO DI CONEGLIANO: $15  Lively apple and lime aromas; light dry apple flavor.</p>
        <p>. . .  ZARDETTO, PROSECCO DI CONEGLIANO: $14  Apple and anise aromas; fruity with a slight yeastiness.</p>
        <p>. . .  MIONETTO, PROSECCO DI VALDOBBIADENE, FRIZZANTE: $11.60  Dry, lightly fruity and pleasant.</p>
        <p>Listed in order of preference. Prices are those paid in various Manhattan wine shops.</p>
