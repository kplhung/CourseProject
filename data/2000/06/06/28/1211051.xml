        <p>Juan Gonzalez stepped into the batter's box tonight, and just like last week the signals he received were decidedly mixed. One day after the Yankees effectively folded on a trade for the two-time most valuable player by offering him a one-year contract extension they knew he would not accept, Gonzalez returned to Comerica Park to face the Detroit fans.</p>
        <p>There had been speculation that Gonzalez was reluctant to come to New York because of less-than-friendly treatment by New York fans when he was with Texas. But tonight, Detroit fans -- stung by the fact that Gonzalez had considered waiving his no-trade clause if the Yankees made a long-term extension offer -- surely left Gonzalez wondering how much tougher New York could have been. He was greeted by a mixture of boos and restrained applause when he came to the plate as the designated hitter for the first time and then watched -- and listened -- as the mood quickly devolved as his miserable and futile evening wore on.</p>

        <p>Juan Gonzalez stepped into the batter's box tonight, and just like last week the signals he received were decidedly mixed. One day after the Yankees effectively folded on a trade for the two-time most valuable player by offering him a one-year contract extension they knew he would not accept, Gonzalez returned to Comerica Park to face the Detroit fans.</p>
        <p>There had been speculation that Gonzalez was reluctant to come to New York because of less-than-friendly treatment by New York fans when he was with Texas. But tonight, Detroit fans -- stung by the fact that Gonzalez had considered waiving his no-trade clause if the Yankees made a long-term extension offer -- surely left Gonzalez wondering how much tougher New York could have been. He was greeted by a mixture of boos and restrained applause when he came to the plate as the designated hitter for the first time and then watched -- and listened -- as the mood quickly devolved as his miserable and futile evening wore on.</p>
        <p>Fans booed briefly when Gonzalez popped up to end the first inning. And when David Cone struck him out to end the third on three straight pitches with a runner on third base, the discontent was apparent.</p>
        <p>Detroit Manager Phil Garner would later concede that he thought Gonzalez was pressing, particularly on that at-bat, when he flailed wildly at pitches out of the strike zone.</p>
        <p>The evening only grew worse for Gonzalez. He entered the game 10 for 64 with men in scoring position, the fourth-worst mark among American League regulars. Tonight, he went 0 for 4 with men in scoring position and was 0 for 6 for the game. He was even booed when his boyhood friend Bernie Williams covered much of center field to make a marvelous running catch of a Gonzalez fly ball in the 11th inning.</p>
        <p>General Manager Randy Smith had expressed concern about the fans' reaction before the game, indicating that how Gonzalez is received directly affects his comfort level with Detroit and could affect whether Gonzalez chooses to consider a long-term deal. So bad was the reception that the Tigers' owner, Michael Ilitch, made a rare postgame appearance in the clubhouse to boost Gonzalez's spirits.</p>
        <p>Gonzalez later recalled the conversation.</p>
        <p>''He told me: 'Keep your head up. I've never seen the fans on one player like that,' '' Gonzalez said.</p>
        <p>Gonzalez declined to speak to reporters either before or after the game. But Garner, too, was troubled by the reception Gonzalez received.</p>
        <p>''Fans have a right to express their opinion,'' Garner said. ''For radio people to say to boo him, I don't understand it. I don't know where they're coming from.''</p>
        <p>It is difficult to know where Gonzalez is coming from right now. He has been virtually silent since the deal collapsed Monday night. The clubhouse television was conveniently blaring hourly updates of the Yankees' ongoing talks to acquire Sosa this afternoon, providing surreal background music for the player the Yankees had snubbed just one day before as he hurriedly changed his clothes before the game without commenting on the head-spinning circumstances of the last few days.</p>
        <p>''Leave me alone, please,'' Gonzalez said to reporters before tonight's game. It is, in part, Gonzalez's discomfort with public speaking that has led to rampant speculation about his intentions, Smith said.</p>
        <p>''It would make it easier for a lot of people if he said what is on his mind,'' Smith said. ''People try to speak for Juan. A lot of people make their own educated guess, but the only person who knows is Juan.''</p>
        <p>The general manager did not question the Yankees' motives for negotiating the deal, but he did say he never thought the trade would get done.</p>
        <p>''I don't think anybody thought it would turn out any different than it did turn out,'' Smith said. ''From all the phone calls I received, I don't think it was much ado about nothing. I don't think you go through all the stuff you go through if you're not serious about doing something. I never thought he was going. It was a thing that needed to be played out. We felt we should stay out of it. I said, 'Juan, I think it's in your best interest to play this out.' He needed to make the decision he's comfortable with.''</p>
        <p>Smith and Garner spoke to Gonzalez last week, when the trade was initially being hammered out. Garner said Gonzalez told him he did not want to go and expressed regret that he wasn't playing better in Detroit.</p>
        <p>''If those weren't true emotions, he deserves an Academy Award,'' Smith said. ''The man was very sincere in our conversation. He was sincere in his feelings about the organization.''</p>
