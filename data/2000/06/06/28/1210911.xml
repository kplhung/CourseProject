        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is indeed nothing unusual for people to spend years in jail unjustly in modern Russia (Op-Ed, June 21). Furthermore, people who are arrested by the F.S.B., the federal domestic intelligence agency that succeeded the K.G.B., do not have even a glimmer of hope for an open or fair trial.</p>
        <p>When a colleague of mine, Igor Sutyagin, a researcher at a Moscow academic institute, was arrested eight months ago on charges of treason and espionage, the F.S.B. promptly classified his case. Now it will be heard behind closed doors.</p>
        <p>Why does the agency shun open trials? Certainly not because state secrets are involved, since Dr. Sutyagin has never had access to such secrets. Rather, it is because the agency's charges will not withstand the scrutiny of an open trial.</p>
        <p>All this shows that the K.G.B. is back in Russia. In fact, it has never left. The only question is whether Russians can stop it from tightening its hold on the country.</p>
        <p>PAVEL PODVIG  Moscow, June 23, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a researcher at the Center for Arms Control Studies.</p>
