        <p>When Vice President Al Gore announced last week that he was releasing the transcript from his April 18 interview with Justice Department investigators, he confidently declared, ''I think the truth is my friend in this.''</p>
        <p>Democrats are convinced that he is right. Attorney General Janet Reno is unlikely to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mr. Gore's 1996 fund-raising activities, they say. And voters will be inclined to view Mr. Gore as having been truthful in the interview and forthright in releasing the transcript.</p>
        <p>But Republicans clearly believe Mr. Gore's transcript will also be their friend. Even if Ms. Reno does not appoint a special prosecutor, they say, the mere whiff of scandal from the transcript will hurt the vice president this November.</p>
        <p>And perhaps more useful, Republican strategists argue, will be Mr. Gore's words themselves. In the frequently combative four hours of questioning, conducted under oath, the vice president often comes across as evasive or legalistic, they assert. Many of his answers are too carefully parsed. And more than a few times, his memory -- considered to be quite excellent -- fails.</p>
        <p>For that reason, Republicans argue, Mr. Gore's performance that day can only bolster their contention that he, like President Clinton, plays fast and loose with the truth.</p>
        <p>''When I read one of his answers, I laughed out loud because it sounded so Clintonesque,'' said Mark Miller, executive director the Republican Leadership Council, a centrist group. ''He was trying to define the word 'raising.' And I just said to myself, he's learned from the master.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller was referring to a passage in which Robert Conrad of the Justice Department's task force on campaign finance abuses, quizzed Mr. Gore about White House events in which contributors, or potential contributors, met with Mr. Clinton or Mr. Gore over coffee. Had anyone told Mr. Gore that those coffees would be used to raise money, Mr. Conrad asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore replied, ''Well, let me define the term 'raising,' if I could, because if you mean by it, would they be events at which money was raised, the answer is no.'' In fact, Mr. Gore said, the coffees were a means to show potential contributors ''respect,'' and that the pitch for money would come later. Hence, they were not fund-raisers, he argued.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad followed up. Did Mr. Gore know that, according to a Senate Republican report, more than 103 White House coffees had helped raise $26.4 million? And given that report, would it not be fair to describe the coffees as ''a fund-raising tool?''</p>
        <p>''I hesitate to wordsmith it,'' Mr. Gore replied. ''I would not call them fund-raising tools.''</p>
        <p>To some political analysts, such hair-splitting echoes President Clinton's response to a question about whether he was having an affair with Monica S. Lewinsky: ''It depends on what the definition of is, is.'' Or Mr. Gore's explanation for why he had not broken the law when he made fund-raising phone calls from the White House, that there was ''no controlling legal authority.''</p>
        <p>Of that reply, Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said: ''If he had not used that tortured expression a few years ago, which has become a mantra for evasion and subterfuge, I would think this would be less damaging.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides argue that the public will see Mr. Gore's answers as reasonable and forthright, given the contentious conditions of the interview. More important, they assert that the public no longer cares about the continuing scandal investigations, and that there may even be an electoral backlash against Republicans who continue to push for more.</p>
        <p>''The Republicans think this plays into Clinton fatigue,'' said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's press secretary. ''But the thing people are fatigued with is scandal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's argument with Mr. Conrad over the definition of ''fund-raiser'' spilled over into questions about his 1996 appearance at the Hsi Lai Temple in Los Angeles. In 1996, Mr. Gore described that event as ''community outreach.'' In 1997, he called it ''a political event'' at which ''finance people were going to be present.'' And to Mr. Conrad, he called it a ''finance-related event.''</p>
        <p>Asked to define that, Mr. Gore said the event was not a fund-raiser because, ''There was no solicitation of money. I did not see any money or checks exchange hands.''</p>
        <p>But several people who attended the temple event, including Buddhist monks and nuns, later gave checks to the Democratic Party, in many cases using money that was not their own. The organizer, Maria Hsia, was convicted in March for hiding $109,000 in illegal contributions and making false statements to federal regulators about the luncheon.</p>
        <p>In yet another passage, Mr. Gore seemed to raise questions about the sincerity of form letters to his supporters. One letter contained ''the kind of routine overstatement that is quite common,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>''So, when you refer to them as great friends, you don't necessarily mean that?'' Mr. Conrad asked.</p>
        <p>''I do mean it,'' Mr. Gore replied. ''But I don't mean it in the way that you and I would use the phrase with a lifelong friend that you met in college or something.''</p>
