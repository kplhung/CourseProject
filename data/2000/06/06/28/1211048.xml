        <p>First, the drug makers rolled out advertisements featuring ''Flo,'' an arthritic bowler who warned against a Clinton administration proposal for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Now the industry is enticing twenty-somethings to call their grandparents and urge them to lobby against the Clinton drug plan.</p>
        <p>The global drug industry, operating through a group that can legally conceal the source of its money and the targets of its spending, has accelerated lobbying against the administration's drug proposal, which it contends will lead to price controls and throttle pharmaceutical research.</p>
        <p>The stepped-up campaign coincides with a vote in the House that is expected as early as Wednesday on competing Republican and Democratic proposals on Medicare drugs.</p>
        <p>Citizens for Better Medicare, a group created a year ago by drug manufacturers, has spent more than $2 million in just the past three weeks on television advertisements opposing the administration's drug proposal, according to the Democratic officials who are tracking its advertising.</p>
        <p>Last month, Citizens for Better Medicare tried to draw young visitors to its two Web sites by offering free $10 calling cards and urging them to telephone their grandparents to talk about Medicare drug coverage. Demand for the free cards was so great that the group is now asking people to call their grandparents ''on your own dime.''</p>
        <p>Since its inception last July, the group has spent more than $30 million on television advertising alone and unknown amounts on radio, print and Internet advertising, said the analysis conducted by the Democrats.</p>
        <p>Many of the recent television spots are running in the same regions of the country as a new Democratic National Committee advertising  campaign supporting the administration's prescription drug plan.</p>
        <p>The group operates under a tax provision allowing it to engage in issue advocacy but not to campaign for or against candidates. But it has focused its advertising on the districts of a number of Democrats who support expanded Medicare drug benefits, skating close to the rule barring direct involvement in elections.</p>
        <p>The most recent drug industry advertisements warn against allowing ''big government'' into people's medicine chests. They also charge that millions of seniors will lose their drug benefits if the Clinton plan is enacted. Citizens for Better Medicare urges a ''bipartisan approach'' that would leave coverage of the cost of prescription drugs in the hands of private insurers.</p>
        <p>Critics say the group is little more than a front organization for the drug industry, which they say is lobbying to kill drug benefits while also offering a vague compromise plan that has little support in Congress.</p>
        <p>''They say they're all for better Medicare, but the point is this is a very, very deceptive campaign,'' said Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut. ''Look at their name: these are not citizens, they are not for a better Medicare. This is a pharmaceutical industry front group, pure and simple. Their interest is to distort the issue and frighten the elderly rather than have a debate on an affordable drug coverage for seniors.''</p>
        <p>Timothy C. Ryan, the executive director of Citizens for Better Medicare, acknowledged that the majority of the group's money comes from drug makers, but he said the aim was not to thwart legislation, only to ensure that any drug plan would not create a costly new bureaucracy or lead to government price controls on medicine.</p>
        <p>''Ultimately this is a philosophical debate about whether you stand for greater or lesser government control as we devise a plan to help seniors better afford their medicines,'' Mr. Ryan said.</p>
        <p>He added that while Citizens for Better Medicare and the pharmaceutical companies oppose Democratic plans for drug coverage, they are not fully supportive of the Republican alternative, either. It would provide subsidies for the elderly to purchase private prescription drug insurance.</p>
        <p>''We would like to see comprehensive reform,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''In an election year with a lot at stake, that seems unlikely.''</p>
        <p>Citizens for Better Medicare describes itself on its Web site as a broad-based coalition of ''patients, seniors, pharmaceutical research companies, doctors, caregivers, hospitals, employers and health care experts.'' The group lists more than 40 members, including the well-known National Association of Manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>Lesser-known members include the Alliance for Aging Research; the Alliance for Lung Cancer Advocacy, Support and Education; the Association of Black Cardiologists; the Healthcare Marketing and Communications Council and the Kidney Cancer Association. All receive substantial support from drug companies, according to a study published last week by Public Citizen, a group founded by Ralph Nader.</p>
        <p>Citizens for Better Medicare was established as the lobbying and grass-roots organizing arm of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association. Last year, Mr. Ryan left the association, where he served as marketing director, to lead Citizens for Better Medicare.</p>
        <p>''It was a phony coalition when it was started, and it's a phony coalition now,'' said Martin A. Corry, director of federal affairs for the AARP. ''They were created by the pharmaceutical industry and are almost entirely funded by the pharmaceutical industry. They're not fooling anybody.''</p>
        <p>The group was set up under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, which governs political activity by nonprofit organizations. It does not have to report its income or divulge its spending, so long as it sticks to issue advocacy and does not advocate the election or defeat of candidates.</p>
        <p>Such groups can accept money from any source, including foreign corporations and individuals. Several of the biggest members of the pharmaceutical association are the United States subsidiaries of European pharmaceutical concerns, including Bayer A.G., Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc., Glaxo Wellcome P.L.C., Hoechst Marion Roussel A.G. and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc.</p>
        <p>Citizens for Better Medicare is one of the prime targets of members of Congress who have introduced legislation to require greater disclosure by so-called 527 groups.</p>
        <p>[Early on Wednesday, the House passed a measure to open these groups to greater scrutiny, requiring them to disclose their donors and spending. The Senate passed a similar version earlier this month, but it is not clear whether the Senate Republican leadership will try to prevent further action on the measure.]</p>
        <p>In its advertising, Citizens for Better Medicare has taken aim at a number of House Democrats who co-sponsored a bill that would require drug companies to offer discounts to pharmacies for medicines they sell to Medicare recipients. The advertisements name Representatives Leonard L. Boswell of Iowa, Darlene Hooley of Oregon, Bill Luther of Minnesota and Mark Udall of Colorado, but stop short of telling viewers to vote against them.</p>
        <p>The group reserved particular wrath for Brian Schweitzer of Montana, a rancher and first-time candidate who is challenging Senator Conrad Burns, the two-term incumbent Republican.</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. Schweitzer led a widely publicized bus trip of seniors to Canada to dramatize the lower cost of prescription medicines there. Citizens for Better Medicare responded with an advertisement broadcast across Montana. ''Brian Schweitzer wants Canadian-style government-controlled health care on prescription medications here in America,'' the narrator intoned. ''Tell Brian Schweitzer no thanks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ryan called Mr. Schweitzer's bus trip a ''stunt'' and said the drug industry wanted to explain that drugs were cheaper in Canada because Canada imposes price controls under its national health system.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Schweitzer said the industry's tactic backfired, increasing his name recognition and creating a groundswell of support.</p>
        <p>''It was clear what they were trying to do -- prop up the failing re-election bid of Conrad Burns,'' Mr. Schweitzer said in a telephone interview. He estimated that Citizens for Better Medicare has spent between $500,000 and $750,000 in radio and television advertising in Montana, including $60,000 in radio advertisements last week alone.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 30, 2000, Friday  An article on Wednesday about lobbying by the drug industry against the Clinton administration's Medicare prescription drug proposal included an outdated reference to the Alliance for Lung Cancer Advocacy, Support and Education. The group was indeed a member of Citizens for Better Medicare, a group largely financed by the pharmaceutical industry. But last week it severed the connection because it was uncomfortable with the group's aggressive lobbying against expansion of Medicare benefits, a senior executive of the alliance said.</p>
