      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Imagine Edna St. Vincent Millay resurrected as a Los Angeles-based songwriter and performer and you have Amanda McBroom, the composer of ''The Rose'' and a theatrically trained singer whose plummy folk-pop alto is a perfect match for her own material. Although some of those songs settle for greeting-card platitudes, the best ones, like ''The Portrait,'' ''Errol Flynn'' (a tribute to her father, a supporting actor who worked with that star) and ''Ship in a Bottle,'' are beautifully precise, insightful verses that transcend the homespun to convey a deep personal sadness.</p>
        <p>Ms. McBroom, who is appearing through July 6 at Joe's Pub (with Joel Silberman at the piano) presents herself as a robust, cheerful everywoman who sees through the  romance-novel fantasies that sustain her characters through dull marriages and dimming hopes. She offers an unusually direct and honest vision of life as a process of gaining wisdom while letting go of cherished dreams. The warmth of her stage personality and her voice, which spills over with empathy, act as a protective balm against the songs' bleaker sentiments.</p>

        <p>Imagine Edna St. Vincent Millay resurrected as a Los Angeles-based songwriter and performer and you have Amanda McBroom, the composer of ''The Rose'' and a theatrically trained singer whose plummy folk-pop alto is a perfect match for her own material.

        <p>Ms. McBroom, who is appearing through July 6 at Joe's Pub (with Joel Silberman at the piano) presents herself as a robust, cheerful everywoman who sees through the  romance-novel fantasies that sustain her characters through dull marriages and dimming hopes. She offers an unusually direct and honest vision of life as a process of gaining wisdom while letting go of cherished dreams. The warmth of her stage personality and her voice, which spills over with empathy, act as a protective balm against the songs' bleaker sentiments.</p>
        <p>Monday's opening-night performance was leavened by astutely funny songs about plastic surgery (''The Lift'' written with Michele Brourman) a clever pop blues takeoff on  Shakespeare (''Ariel's Lament,'' written with Mr. Silberman) and a sharp but good-humored attack on Martha Stewart (again written with Mr. Silberman), done in a mock operetta style. For these lighter songs Ms. McBroom slipped into a saucy, Betty Boop-influenced voice.</p>
        <p>The set's one nonoriginal number, ''Marieke,'' a cabaret warhorse by Jacques Brel (the composer whom Ms. McBroom credited as her greatest influence) was a stunner that she built to a rending emotional peak.</p>
