      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In two important new cases, New York State and New York City have filed lawsuits against gun manufacturers for injuries to their citizens from unsafe and illegal weapons. Attorney General Eliot Spitzer filed the first state lawsuit in the country on Monday with a forceful new argument that gun makers are contributing to a public nuisance by flooding the state with illegal firearms. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's lawsuit against gun makers last week also lends a powerful political voice to the gun control debate, since he is the first Republican mayor to join more than 30 communities taking the manufacturers to court. For that reason, Mr. Giuliani helps rob the nation's gun makers of their expectation that the issue will go away if more Republicans are elected this November.</p>
        <p>The city's lawsuit, unlike the state's, raises some concerns by including the nation's largest handgun manufacturer, Smith &amp; Wesson, the only gun maker that has negotiated an important gun control deal with the Clinton administration. The Smith &amp; Wesson settlement is not perfect, but it represents a brave move against gun violence. The National Rifle Association has organized a boycott against the company, and Smith &amp; Wesson has tried to back out of parts of its original agreement. But by lumping Smith &amp; Wesson with other gun makers, the city could inadvertently discourage similar settlements by other manufacturers that might conclude that there is no point in compromising if they are going to be sued anyway. The city should work quickly to settle with Smith &amp; Wesson, making sure that the company honors the terms of its original agreement with the administration.</p>

        <p>In two important new cases, New York State and New York City have filed lawsuits against gun manufacturers for injuries to their citizens from unsafe and illegal weapons. Attorney General Eliot Spitzer filed the first state lawsuit in the country on Monday with a forceful new argument that gun makers are contributing to a public nuisance by flooding the state with illegal firearms. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's lawsuit against gun makers last week also lends a powerful political voice to the gun control debate, since he is the first Republican mayor to join more than 30 communities taking the manufacturers to court. For that reason, Mr. Giuliani helps rob the nation's gun makers of their expectation that the issue will go away if more Republicans are elected this November.</p>
        <p>The city's lawsuit, unlike the state's, raises some concerns by including the nation's largest handgun manufacturer, Smith &amp; Wesson, the only gun maker that has negotiated an important gun control deal with the Clinton administration. The Smith &amp; Wesson settlement is not perfect, but it represents a brave move against gun violence. The National Rifle Association has organized a boycott against the company, and Smith &amp; Wesson has tried to back out of parts of its original agreement. But by lumping Smith &amp; Wesson with other gun makers, the city could inadvertently discourage similar settlements by other manufacturers that might conclude that there is no point in compromising if they are going to be sued anyway. The city should work quickly to settle with Smith &amp; Wesson, making sure that the company honors the terms of its original agreement with the administration.</p>
        <p>Filed in conjunction with the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, in Washington, the city's suit argues correctly that the manufacturers have been negligent in marketing and distribution, often saturating markets in states with weaker gun controls so that weapons can more easily move into New York City, which has tougher gun laws. The suit also accuses the gun makers of producing a defective product missing crucial safety mechanisms.</p>
        <p>The state's suit does not ask for damages, a good way of putting extra pressure on other gun makers to negotiate a deal like Smith &amp; Wesson's with the federal government. Mr. Spitzer argues that the state should be working more to change behavior than to collect dollars and that his method would bring a speedier resolution. But these bullies may not listen to reason unless they are threatened with paying a hefty price.</p>
        <p>The lawsuits appear at an important time, when most manufacturers are trying to get the courts and Congress to stop local and state governments from rewarding Smith &amp; Wesson with contracts to provide guns for law enforcement. The state should consider adding damages to its case. The city needs to subtract Smith &amp; Wesson from its case. Then both can focus more heat on the less responsible gun makers.</p>
