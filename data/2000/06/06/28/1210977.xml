        <p>Moo-Stripa the cow is missing.</p>
        <p>ON Monday morning, Moo-Stripa, a seven-foot-long fiberglass cow that is part of the 500 such statues that make up a citywide art event called Cow Parade 2000, stood contentedly in Forest Park in Richmond Hill, Queens.</p>
        <p>Sometime after 11 a.m., she disappeared, the police said. Since the cow was bolted to a 500-pound concrete base, foul play is suspected.</p>
        <p>Moo-Stripa, who was decorated by a seventh-grade student at P.S. 43 in Queens, has orange, white, green and blue stripes. She is four feet tall and weighs 80 pounds.</p>
        <p>Pat Smith, a spokesman for Cow Parade 2000, said that some vandalism had been expected, and that half of a dozen cows had had ears cut off or flanks defaced with graffiti.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the sponsors of the exhibition, Cow Parade Holdings Corporation, have offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the cow thief.</p>
        <p>The corporation's president, Jerome Elbaum, had a question: ''Why would anyone want to damage these beautiful cows, which were decorated with such love and creativity by talented artists, including New York City schoolchildren?''</p>
