        <p>Kenyon Martin is still rehabilitating the leg he fractured three months ago, but insists he will be healthy for training camp. ''I should be fine,'' he said. ''I just have to work extra hard.''</p>
        <p>Darius Miles has not had a full-time job, but he would like to be a sixth or seventh man for a National Basketball Association team.</p>
        <p>''I think teams will pick me like they did Kevin Garnett or Tracy McGrady or Kobe -- a player that comes straight out of high school that can learn quickly, like they did,'' the 18-year-old said today. ''That's how I think teams look at me. I don't think they look at me to dominate the game.''</p>
        <p>This is not your grandfather's draft. It is not even Garnett's 1995 draft. They are calling it the Stars of Tomorrow Auction.</p>
        <p>Martin, the consensus national college basketball player of the year, is expected to be taken No. 1 Wednesday night by the soft-in-the-middle Nets.</p>
        <p>Stromile Swift's two-month ascension from unknown L.S.U. shot-blocker to bona fide lottery pick will most likely end with the Vancouver Grizzlies selecting the 6-foot-9-inch forward No. 2.</p>
        <p>Late tonight, the Los Angeles Clippers were on the verge of shaking up the draft order. They were seriously considering trading their No. 3 pick to Orlando. The Magic is offering its No. 5 and 10th picks along with Corey Maggette, Matt Harpring or Michael Doleac in order to grab Miles.</p>
        <p>That would drop Iowa State the power forward Marcus Fizer into Chicago's lap with the fourth pick. Chris Mihm, the 7-foot Texas center, is expected not to go lower than No. 7.</p>
        <p>After Florida's Mike Miller, Cincinnati's DerMarr Johnson and Fresno State's Courtney Alexander, the nation's leading scorer, a plethora of forwards and 6-foot-and-under point guards will compete for attention in the Target Center green room.</p>
        <p>Another bumper crop of early-entry candidates applied. Of the 37 prospects, 27 are college underclassmen, 8 are international players and 2 are high school teenagers. After Miles, DeShawn Stevenson out of Washington Union High School in Fresno, Calif., hopes to become the 15th player in the league's modern era to jump straight from high school to the N.B.A.</p>
        <p>With the proliferation of teenagers still storming the league with alarming regularity, free agency has proven more of a quick fix than the draft in recent years. But there are power brokers who still see the annual talent auction as a genuine way to build their teams.</p>
        <p>Chicago General Manager Jerry Krause, who once drafted Scottie Pippen and Charles Oakley, possesses the Nos. 4, 7 and 24 picks in the first round, not to mention the 32nd through 34th picks in the second round.</p>
        <p>Orlando has the 5th, 10th and 13th selections, while the Clippers pick No. 3, No. 18 and No. 30.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, six players from three teams were swapped today in the first action of the postseason.</p>
        <p>Milwaukee dealt forwards Robert Traylor and J. R. Reid to the Cavaliers while trading the veteran guard Vinny Del Negro to the Warriors. Cleveland dealt guard Bob Sura to the Warriors, and Golden State sent forwards Jason Caffey and Billy Owens to Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>Martin, out of Cincinnati, would become the second power forward to go No. 1 in consecutive years after Chicago plucked Elton Brand out of Duke last June.</p>
        <p>He would also be the first top pick from Dallas since the Charlotte Hornets selected Larry Johnson No. 1 in 1991.</p>
        <p>The Nets ran a battery of tests on Martin's broken leg and had their doctors closely inspect the injury. No long-term effects were projected, and the Nets' president, Rod Thorn, has intimated he will most likely take Martin with the first pick -- if Orlando does not pry it out of his hands with a lucrative deal.</p>
        <p>''That remains to be seen,'' Martin said today. ''I'm going to do all I can to help the team win if I'm there. They have Keith, Stephon, Kendall Gill and people like that, so they have a pretty good nucleus already.''</p>
        <p>If Martin does not go No. 1? ''I don't think I'll slip far,'' he said. ''If I don't go No. 1, there's a good chance I'll go two or three.''</p>
        <p>Miles is the most intriguing player available. Lean and agile at 6-9 and less than 220 pounds, he can sky over defenders or contort his way through mounds of muscle in the paint. Last year, he worked as a counselor at Michael Jordan's summer camp in Santa Barbara, Calif.</p>
        <p>''We played a little counselor game every night and he picked me to be on his team every night,'' Miles said of Jordan, who has publicly stated he would take Miles if Washington had the No. 1 pick. He truly liked the kid's precocious behavior.</p>
        <p>''If somebody like the Lakers or Portland had a top pick, I know I'd never get to play,'' Miles said when asked if he'd rather go to a lottery team. ''Sometimes I'd probably just put my warm-up suit on, and not even my jersey. Low teams need the lottery pick.</p>
        <p>''They need players that are going to make a difference. Like Vince Carter. He came in, and three years later they made the playoffs.''</p>
