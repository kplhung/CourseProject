        <p>ON the menu at Blue Hill, a new restaurant on Washington Place, there's a dish that might give diners pause. It's called ''Not Another Roast Chicken.'' Dan Barber, one of the chefs, said he wants diners to know that this isn't the cliched dish found in every restaurant. It's a free-range organic chicken from a small, obscure farm, roasted in a fancy high-tech oven imported from Austria.</p>
        <p>''We're inviting interaction,'' Mr. Barber said. He wants to provoke a reaction, so his waiters can have a chance to explain how it's different.</p>
        <p>This is also Mr. Barber's way of using the menu as one more way of communicating with the customer. In New York these days the traditional serious menu is being upstaged by menus that try to make some personal comment: funny, ironic, intriguing, sometimes just sophomoric.</p>
        <p>Personality is beginning to emerge somewhere between the entree and the price, offering small glimpses of the chefs tucked away in the kitchen. They're not just dutifully cranking out dinners; they have ideas about food and eating that they want to express to their customers. And the menu is the first chance to communicate those ideas.</p>
        <p>When this is done well and with restraint, it's refreshing, even charming. For instance, on the Lobster Club's menu, you'll come across ''Creamed Spinach With Almost No Fat?'' You have to think about it for a second. It's a tease. There is no such thing as creamed spinach without fat.</p>
        <p>When it's not done so well, as in the references to ''Seizure Salad'' at Greenwich Village Bistro and ''Chocolate Salami'' at Revel, it can leave you worrying about who's behind that swinging door.</p>
        <p>The other, serious, school of menu writing lists all the ingredients and their sources like film credits. As reading material, this ranks in excitement with a dental equipment catalog: by the end, you are dizzy and exhausted from the whirl of words, and so bored you could cry.</p>
        <p>Anne Rosenzweig's menus at the Lobster Club are a reaction to these styles. ''I've always felt that a menu was an opportunity for chefs to have fun and poke a little fun at themselves,'' she said, ''because I think chefs take themselves too seriously and menus are too serious.''</p>
        <p>Her ''Sexy Grits,'' ''Voluptuous Cauliflower'' and ''He-Man Salad,'' appearing periodically on the menu, may not be ha-ha funny, but they are surprising. ''When we're devising dishes in the kitchen, it's exactly how I talk about food,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Thomas Keller, the chef at the French Laundry in the Napa Valley, is famously irreverent on his menu. Two of his classic dishes are ''Macaroni and Cheese'' and ''Tongue in Cheek.'' Of course, the macaroni and cheese is made with lobster, mascarpone and orzo. And the tongue in cheek is braised veal tongue and beef cheeks.</p>
        <p>There is a fine line, however, between clever and cloying.</p>
        <p>''Flantastico'' at Patria, for instance, feels more like an entry in the Zagat guide describing a flan shop. And ''Fusilli Aum! Aum!'' -- Neapolitan for ''Fusilli Yum! Yum!'' -- at La Locanda is cute, but when the moment comes to order it, who is actually going to say the words?</p>
        <p>Fortunately some chefs realize when they've crossed the line. At Atlas, the desserts called ''Rumpledinger's Ice-Cargots'' and ''Vacherin 'A Liberal Interpretation' '' have been reconsidered.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people just didn't get it,'' said James Danos, the chef. Now, the ice-cargots is called ''Rumpledinger's Ice Cream and Sorbet.'' The vacherin has been retired.</p>
        <p>Mr. Danos did, however, keep the ''Baked Black Truffle Mutton Button,'' a cheese course of sheep's milk cheese and truffles that is nothing more than a delicious little treat.</p>
        <p>At Blue Hill, Mr. Barber, 30, and his partner, Alex Urena, 29, are new to running a restaurant. He admitted that they have had second thoughts about the commentary they have added to their menu. ''I wonder if saying 'Not Another Roast Chicken' is a little too early for us,'' he said. Someone like Mr. Keller, he pointed out, has the pedigree and the cooking skills to back it up.</p>
        <p>And yet, Mr. Barber and Mr. Urena are both shy about going out into the dining room. To them, a menu with bits of their personalities -- they also offer ''Real Slow Cooked Salmon'' and ''Spring'' (a salad) -- is a way to step out of the kitchen without actually speaking to people.</p>
        <p>Of course, when you invite communication, you may actually get it. Not long ago, one diner sent the roast chicken back to the kitchen with a message for the chef: it was, indeed, just another roast chicken.</p>
