        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed new rules yesterday to tighten standards on what additional services accounting firms could sell to companies whose books they audit.

        <p>''Without confidence in an auditor's objectivity and fairness, how can an investor know whether to trust the numbers?'' asked Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the S.E.C.

        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed new rules yesterday to tighten standards on what additional services accounting firms could sell to companies whose books they audit. The proposal immediately ran into stiff criticism from some accounting firms, but gained support from others.</p>
        <p>''Without confidence in an auditor's objectivity and fairness, how can an investor know whether to trust the numbers?'' asked Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the S.E.C. ''Sound and verifiable numbers are to financial markets what oxygen is to breathing. Our financial markets simply cannot work without access to strong, high-quality financial reporting.''</p>
        <p>The proposed rules, which will be subject to public comment for 75 days and then to public hearings before the commission decides whether to adopt them, would in some cases bar accounting firms from performing consulting services they now perform for companies whose books they audit.</p>
        <p>The proposal asks for comment on a wide range of issues, including whether auditors should be allowed to write promotional materials for tax shelter advocates, whether they should be allowed to help design the financial systems they will then critique as part of their audits and whether it is proper for auditors to lobby on behalf of their clients.</p>
        <p>''This is the first time there has ever been a rule proposal on the scope of services these firms provide,'' said Lynn Turner, the S.E.C.'s chief accountant. ''People have wondered whether that growing scope related to some of the major audit failures we have seen.''</p>
        <p>Three of the five largest accounting firms, and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, strongly criticized the proposal as being unnecessary and seeking to solve a problem that does not exist. They have already begun to enlist Congressional allies in case they need to seek legislation to overturn any rules the commission adopts.</p>
        <p>They argued that there was no demonstrated problem, and challenged the S.E.C. to name one audit that was compromised because the auditor also performed consulting services for the client. And, they added, the knowledge of consultants helped, not hurt, the audit.</p>
        <p>''For us to protect investors, you need a wide range of expertise within our firm,'' said Stephen Aliss of KPMG. ''The direction of this proposal is to drive talent from our firm.''</p>
        <p>He argued that it would be hard to attract highly qualified consultants because many potential customers would be off limits as audit clients.</p>
        <p>Representatives of Deloitte &amp; Touche and Arthur Andersen joined in the criticism. ''The more you know about the client, the better the audit is going to be,'' said Jeffrey Peck, a managing director of Arthur Andersen, adding that the S.E.C. proposal would reduce the quality of audits.</p>
        <p>But the remaining big five firms -- Ernst &amp; Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers -- said they broadly support the S.E.C.'s initiative. ''We believe that the perceived independence problem is becoming a factor in the marketplace and needs to be dealt with,'' said Larry Parnall, a spokesman for Ernst &amp; Young. ''We hope the rule-making process is the beginning of this effort and we look forward to working with the S.E.C. on this.''</p>
        <p>PricewaterhouseCoopers issued a statement saying: ''We are fully committed to supporting the S.E.C.'s efforts to enhance audit quality and investor protection. At this crucial moment in the history of the accounting profession, the public interest must take precedence over self-interest.''</p>
        <p>That split in the accounting profession could make it easier for the S.E.C. to take action this year. Some of the opponents contend that the commission was rushing the comment period in an effort to complete its work before a new president took office in January. The new president would be able to name a new S.E.C. chairman if he wished to do so.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Levitt emphasized that the commission had already discussed the ideas extensively with the industry and was open to all comments. ''The firms have nothing to fear and investors have everything to gain from this open public debate,'' he said. He said he hoped for broad public participation in the process.</p>
        <p>The A.F.L.-C.I.O. offered support for the proposal. ''We believe that the proposed changes, by extending the range of financial, business and employment relationships that are deemed to create conflicts of interest, will ensure that auditors are genuinely independent,'' said John Sweeney, the federation's president.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. proposal also includes a series of generally noncontroversial proposals to liberalize the rules regarding investments by employees and officials of auditing firms. In general, the rules would allow many more investments and would substantially relax the rules relating to spouses of such people.</p>
        <p>A report released by the S.E.C. in January concluded that most partners at PricewaterhouseCoopers had violated the existing rules and similar studies are now underway regarding the other four firms.</p>
        <p>Accountants who are opposed to the other changes complained that the S.E.C. should have separated those rules to enable them to be adopted quickly.</p>
        <p>All the major accounting firms have considered efforts to separate themselves to some extent from their consulting divisions. Ernst &amp; Young has gone the furthest, selling its operation. Others are considering a variety of revamping proposals, including the sale of minority stakes. The proposal seeks comment on the extent of separation that would be needed before a related consulting firm could provide otherwise prohibited services to the accounting firm's audit client.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner, the S.E.C.'s chief accountant, said the argument that providing consulting services made for better audits ''just doesn't hold water.'' He noted that one study showed three-quarters of audit clients get no other services from their auditing firms. ''Does that mean that in 75 percent of the cases, we have poor audits?''</p>
