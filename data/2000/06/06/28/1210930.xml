        <p>A bewildered Jennifer Capriati once searched out a coach capable of salvaging the confidence she had lost during the haze of her dysfunctional disappearance from tennis.

        <p>A bewildered Jennifer Capriati once searched out a coach capable of salvaging the confidence she had lost during the haze of her dysfunctional disappearance from tennis. With her spirits in a puddle, she found a faith healer of sorts in Harold Solomon to push her through a remarkable revival last year.</p>
        <p>But he was not in the friends box of Court 1 this afternoon. In mid-April, Capriati parted with Solomon, began a romance with a talented but underachieving Belgian player, Xavier Malisse, and let her discipline to diet slip. But with her ranking tumbling from 13th to 18th, and after a disturbing first-round exit in the French Open, she did not reach for Solomon again to right her.</p>
        <p>Capriati turned to a familiar face. After she panted just a bit today while overpowering 16th-seeded Dominique Van Roost, 6-2, 6-4, with fuel-injected ground strokes, Capriati stopped lumbering and waved at a coach who once appeared to be part creator of her dark teenage funk: her husky father, Stefano. With him, she will try to reinvent yet another comeback.</p>
        <p>''That's one thing I've learned, how to come back from feeling down or not so confident,'' Capriati said. ''I can always get it back, you know?''</p>
        <p>Eventually, ''always'' seems to run out. But for this second day of Wimbledon -- which left Andre Agassi and Lindsay Davenport, both seeded second, with victories made simpler when their opponents retired with injuries -- two players once branded as the next hot items in American tennis had a chance to keep hope alive.</p>
        <p>At age 24, Capriati pulled off an upset in the first round, as did the 23-year-old Jan-Michael Gambill. With herky-jerky forehands and backhands, the 56th-ranked Gambill swiped the gloss off Australia's paparazzi target, seventh-seeded Lleyton Hewitt, with a 6-3, 6-2, 7-5 victory.</p>
        <p>Gambill was once just like the 19-year-old Hewitt: fresh, handsome and all the rage. Just one week removed from undoing Pete Sampras at Queen's Club and several days into a news media frenzy, Hewitt was facing high expectations. Gambill remembers the hype well.</p>
        <p>''It's very tough to live up to what we have to live up to, frankly,'' said Gambill, referring to his generation of players. ''Pete has done unbelievable. If I somehow make it to anywhere near that level, I'd be very happy.''</p>
        <p>Gambill never wavered against Hewitt. With unshakable nerves, he came up with 5 break points in 11 opportunities. When Hewitt had an opening for a break, he sprayed the ball and converted just one of six. It was odd to see Hewitt so flat. Normally, the buoyant Australian can manufacture enough positive energy to overcome pressure situations.</p>
        <p>''I just had one of those days,'' he said. ''There wasn't much to get pumped up about.''</p>
        <p>Agassi was different in his ability to come with an edge on call. He was playing against a qualifier, the American Taylor Dent, who was ranked 256th but very capable of unveiling the game of his life on Center Court. At least for half an hour. With volleys that kissed the baselines, a 130-mile-an-hour serve that generated eight aces and with pinpoint approach shots, Dent unsettled a crowd assembled to rave about Steffi Graf's domed beau. In 24 minutes, Dent had the first set, 6-2.</p>
        <p>Unfazed, Agassi sharpened his focus and took a 2-6, 6-3, 6-0, 4-0 lead when Dent left the court after falling awkwardly on his right knee. In Dent's wake, there was a question: is this unknown 19-year-old from California, the son of the former Australian Davis Cup player Phil Dent, another American hope?</p>
        <p>''It's always hard to say,'' Agassi said. ''There's a lot you need to have to succeed out there.''</p>
        <p>Having just the right support group is as critical as having the tools. Capriati appeared to have just the right mix with Solomon. Fresh off her success at the United States Open, she zipped through the draw at the Australian Open. On her way to the semifinals, she was effusive about the miracles Solomon had worked on her will. Then, everything changed.</p>
        <p>''It's not always going to last forever, be a forever thing,'' Capriati said. ''Just one of those things. We didn't see things, you know, the same way.''</p>
        <p>Some on the tour wonder if Capriati's budding romance started taking priority over her practice schedule and suspect Malisse's spotty work ethic as a player has rubbed off on her. Whatever the case, Solomon has been dropped, and her father has stepped in at the controls again.</p>
        <p>''It's just that he's known my game ever since, well, he started me playing,'' Capriati said. ''Really, just he knows, I guess, the way to tell me things. He just says the little things here and there the simple way he knows that will make me really understand it.''</p>
        <p>Stefano Capriati has been her coach since the French Open. Although his daughter was not the fittest player on the grounds today, she still managed to lean back on her power and whip up only her third victory in her last nine matches. That's a start to another reclamation project.</p>
        <p>''It's fine for him to be my coach and father,'' Capriati said. ''It's just getting the balance that's the key. You know, I think we've got the right balance now.''</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>Six seeded players were upset Tuesday. Beyond DOMINIQUE VAN ROOST and LLEYTON HEWITT, 13th-seeded AMELIE MAURESMO lost to 47th-ranked GALA LEON GARCIA, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5; seventh-seeded NATHALIE TAUZIAT was beaten by 31st-ranked KIM CLIJSTERS, 6-3, 3-6, 6-2; Tommy Haas upset his fellow German NICOLAS KIEFER, seeded 13th, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-3; and JULIE HALARD-DECUGIS, the 14th-seeded woman, lost to KRISTIE BOOGERT, 7-6 (4), 0-6, 6-1. . . . LINDSAY DAVENPORT was in an uncomfortable position when her friend and doubles partner, CORINA MORARIU, slipped in the second set of their first-round match. Morariu lost her footing, fell to the grass and injured her left shoulder. On a day when she was testing her sore back and getting good results, Davenport was in control, 6-3, 1-0, when Morariu retired, but she felt uneasy with the way her victory came about. ''It's very bittersweet,'' Davenport said. ''It's good I won the first set with two breaks. I was going to have break point at the beginning of the second, but then when something like that happens to a good friend, it's terrible.''</p>
