        <p>THE familiar forest-green awnings and instantly recognizable white ''B'' adorn the new West 66th Street branch of Balducci's, the Greenwich Village speciality market.

        <p>THE familiar forest-green awnings and instantly recognizable white ''B'' adorn the new West 66th Street branch of Balducci's, the Greenwich Village speciality market. But without the name on signs throughout the new place, longtime patrons of the downtown store would be hard-pressed to see a connection. Then again, anyone who had shopped at the original Balducci's in the 1970's and 80's and had not been back since would not recognize it.</p>
        <p>Now that the cooking for the store's formerly fabled prepared foods is no longer done by a member of the Balducci family, now that not a single member of that family works in either of the stores and now that Sutton Place Gourmet owns the Balducci name, the culinary attributes for which it was famous are being diluted.</p>
        <p>In both stores, the meat still looks beautiful, the fish fresh. The shelves are neatly stocked. But the magic of Balducci's has disappeared.</p>
        <p>The downtown store is in serious need of a face-lift. The cases containing the prepared foods are falling apart: a piece of plastic covers a section where plexiglass used to be, and the interior of the cases is scratched.</p>
        <p>In the produce department, once known for having only the best, there are wrinkled eggplants, ridged asparagus, soft cucumbers and zucchini with gouges in the flesh. In the new store the produce is picture perfect, but the peaches are so hard they will rot before they ripen. There isn't a local strawberry in sight.</p>
        <p>In both stores a lot of the merchandise carries the Hay Day label belonging to a chain of Connecticut speciality food stores that Sutton Place bought a few years ago. Sutton Place owns 14 stores on the East Coast.</p>
        <p>There is an occasional glimpse of the past glory, for example in the wonderful flavor of Mama's Mashed Potatoes. Otherwise, the prepared food never rises above the Italian-American food that was common 50 years ago, back when Parmigiano-Reggiano was called Parmesan cheese and came in green cardboard cans. The risotto is so gummy it sticks to the roof of your mouth. The stuffed veal is dry, tough and tasteless. The fresh mozzarella isn't.</p>
        <p>Beyond cannoli and biscotti, there was not another Italian dessert in the 66th Street store. The only fresh pesto was made with coriander, not basil. According to Alan Butzbach, vice president of operations for Balducci's, the breads are either completely baked in Maryland or par-baked there and then finished in New York. Some of the food is prepared in Balducci's central commissary in Long Island City.</p>
        <p>The one thing at Balducci's that hasn't changed are the prices. They are high, but no longer worth it.</p>
