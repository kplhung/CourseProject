        <p>Cable cars may look quaint swooping up and down the streets of San Francisco, but for Dorcey Winant, the white-and-black streetcars that began passing beneath her windows in April hold far less charm.</p>
        <p>''They're huge, and they sound like an 18-wheeler with flat tires,'' said Ms. Winant, a television director. ''These are no Rice-a-Roni trolleys, especially when they wake you up at 5:45 a.m.''</p>
        <p>For those who live along the route of the new Hudson-Bergen Light Rail line, the return of the streetcar after a half-century's absence is igniting more anger than nostalgia.</p>
        <p>Claiming that the trolleys are destroying their quality of life, a group of residents is taking legal action to force New Jersey Transit to reduce the noise the trains make. They say the agency lied when it told them the system would be unobtrusive.</p>
        <p>The wheels screech and thump, the overhead electrical equipment howls and even the heaviest sleepers say they are roused by the bells and horns that sound at every intersection. For those who live near the stations, high-powered station lights fill their apartments with a charmless, round-the-clock glare.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I'm living in a subway tunnel,'' said Donna Gloeckner, an executive at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ''I've become very cranky.''</p>
        <p>Even her cat, Max, has been adversely affected, she said. ''It's like we're living under siege.''</p>
        <p>Transit officials say they are still working out kinks in the 7.5-mile system, which now connects Bayonne to Jersey City's waterfront. When it is completed in 2010, it will reach suburban Bergen County.</p>
        <p>''This is a work in progress,'' said Ken Miller, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit. He said residents whose homes face the tracks were receiving soundproof windows, and engineers have been instructed to honk their horns less often. To reduce the screeching of steel on steel, the agency is experimenting with various kinds of rail lubrication.</p>
        <p>Although the system passes through long stretches of undeveloped land, a six-block portion runs on Essex Street, where most of the dozen plaintiffs live. But even those whose homes are farther away say the trains are an unavoidable nuisance.</p>
        <p>Josephine Sielski, 70, lives more than a block from the tracks, but every time a train crosses nearby Halladay Street, a piercing horn jolts her from her chair. ''People here are sick over it,'' she said.</p>
