        <p>A year ago, they were the highest-profile technology managers ever, making presentations to top executives and corporate boards, testifying before Congress and spending billions of dollars as the world worked feverishly to avert computer chaos as the year 2000 arrived.</p>
        <p>When it did arrive with almost no notable disruptions anywhere, they were relieved, proud and, they acknowledge, surprised. Far sooner than most had expected, it was time to move on.</p>
        <p>But where? With nothing like Y2K in corporate history, there was no obvious next step for most of those who had managed the biggest repair projects.</p>
        <p>Now, nearly six months into the Y2K hereafter, some credit their Y2K assignments with giving their careers a priceless lift. Others think their involvement in what ended up looking to the public like a ridiculously hyped nonevent has held them back.</p>
        <p>Most have gone on to e-commerce jobs that may lack the visibility of the Y2K crusade but put them on the cutting edge of Internet development. A few headed for the exit ramp, like Paul H. Couvillion, who ran DuPont's Year 2000 project for more than two years. Mr. Couvillion, 59, is wallpapering his home in the North Carolina mountains, honing his golf game and spending time with grandchildren as he uses up vacation days on his way to early retirement from DuPont in August.</p>
        <p>''When I got down to the house, I found one of the clocks had stopped at 11:59 on Dec. 31,'' he said. ''I'm keeping it as a reminder of what would have happened if the work hadn't been done.''</p>
        <p>Those not looking ahead to retirement had wondered from the start what Y2K would do to their careers. There was no obvious upside in making sure that computers could recognize the digits 00 in dates as the year 2000 rather than 1900 or an invalid entry. The date flaws, if not found and fixed, seemed likely to wreak havoc on the economy and government services. But in the end it was all about dodging a bullet, not creating something new. In short, failure would bring blame for disaster; few thought that success would result in the kind of profit-creating work that normally enhances careers.</p>
        <p>No wonder some of Paula Larkin's colleagues reacted as if she had been handed a time bomb when she was named to oversee J. P. Morgan's Year 2000 project in 1996.</p>
        <p>''They told me it would be a career-killer,'' Ms. Larkin recalled recently. ''They said that spotlighting people who weren't delivering would make too many enemies within Morgan and that there would be too many outside forces beyond my control.''</p>
        <p>Fortunately for her, her superiors appreciated the ways she used the Year 2000 challenge to update and streamline the bank's technology and to strengthen its relations with customers, other banks and regulators. In March, Ms. Larkin emerged with a promotion to managing director, a two-month paid sabbatical and a choice of attractive assignments.</p>
        <p>''Y2K clearly put me over the top,'' Ms. Larkin said of her promotion. Before starting on her new assignment as project manager for LabMorgan, the bank's new incubator for Internet-based financial businesses, Ms. Larkin used the time off taking golf lessons and renovating a home on Cape Cod.</p>
        <p>Lorraine Gornick felt far less appreciated. A year ago, Ms. Gornick was the longest-serving manager on Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company's Y2K project. She was also the giant retailer's representative to the National Retail Federation's nationwide program to avert panic buying and other Y2K-related disruptions.</p>
        <p>So, when she decided to resign to start her own consulting business after wrapping up the repair project, she expected at least to get an attractive counteroffer. It never came, leading her to conclude that her bosses had not paid much attention to her work or put much thought into her future. To reward herself for five years of Y2K labor, she started her firm, Strategy Alliance, as a part-time business to allow time for singing with two choirs in the Chicago area.</p>
        <p>''It seems so long ago,'' she said of Y2K work before leaving this week for a choir festival in Austria. ''We knew there wouldn't be much recognition if it went well.''</p>
        <p>Sears, for its part, says it promised early in 1999 that every member of its Y2K team would get a ''meaningful'' assignment once the high-risk period was over and that those who stayed found good opportunities. ''No one knew where they were going to land at the time she left,'' said Janice R. Drummond, a Sears spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Many longtime Y2K managers, like Jay Abshier at Texaco Inc., landed in computer security, one of the hottest computer industry niches. The largest contingent, though, moved into cyberspace. Donald Rose, who oversaw Year 2000 preparations for Intel's factories, for example, became co-manager of a new Intel business that markets Internet services to the health care industry. And Del Clark, head of Phillips Petroleum's Y2K project, became director of global e-business overseeing the company's participation on projects like the Web-based procurement exchange that Phillips and 13 other oil and chemical companies set up this year.</p>
        <p>''The pent-up demand was in the e-commerce environment,'' said Brian Robbins, a senior vice president who managed Chase Manhattan's Y2K project and who saw e-business as the logical place to make a splash. ''What else could you go into?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Robbins began talking about his interest in seeing the bank use Internet technology more efficiently with Steven L. Sheinheit, his boss, as the two shuttled among Chase command posts during the New Year's weekend. He ended up running a new 125-member unit called eSpace Services, which provides technology to Chase business units to help them develop both internal and external Internet applications.</p>
        <p>The Internet assignments, like Y2K, often cross traditional boundaries and require tough choices about priorities, according to managers like Brian Cohen, who directed New York City's computer preparations and was named this year as executive director of the city's new E-Government Office, which helps agencies go online. ''I have a shirt that says 'Only (blank) days left,' so you can keep reducing the number in the blank,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''It was given to me for Y2K, but it works in my new job, too.''</p>
        <p>Still, many managers found that prime e-business jobs had been snapped up by others while they were tied up on Y2K work, according to James Devlin, Citibank's Year 2000 project director. And some were sidelined from bidding on promising jobs created by major mergers in the last few years.</p>
        <p>''Given what they know now,'' Mr. Devlin said, ''most people I talk to say they wouldn't have stayed with Y2K.''</p>
