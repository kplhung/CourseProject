        <p>IN all the conversations about Sammy Sosa, two numbers are invariably mentioned, 66 and 63, his total of home runs for the Chicago Cubs in the past two seasons. Hardly anybody has mentioned the numbers 174, 171 and 171, his total of strikeouts for the Chicago Cubs in the past three seasons.</p>
        <p>And he has already struck out 82 times this season.</p>
        <p>That's too many K's -- the scorebook shorthand for a strikeout.</p>
        <p>Too many times Sosa whiffed or took a third strike. Too many times he didn't even hit the ball where it might have dropped between the outfielders or might have been bobbled or thrown away for an error. Too many times when he diminished the chance for a big inning.</p>
        <p>When Sosa's name first surfaced two weeks ago in trade discussions, all those K's were the first stat that one of George Steinbrenner's ''people'' brought up.</p>
        <p>''He's not what we need,'' a respected member of the Yankee hierarchy replied when asked if a trade for Sosa was being considered. ''He swings and misses too much.''</p>
        <p>When Steinbrenner was reminded of Sosa's strikeout habit, the principal owner had his ''people'' pursue Juan Gonzalez, the Detroit Tigers' outfielder who hit 45 and 39 homers for the Texas Rangers the past two seasons with a more reasonable number of strikeouts for a slugger, 126 and 105.</p>
        <p>But after Gonzalez declined the Yankees' one-year, $12.5 million offer, Sosa again appeared to be the principal owner's fondest remedy for the Yankees, who are struggling to score runs and struggling to return to what they consider their rightful place, first, in the American League East.</p>
        <p>But for all his home runs, Sammy Sosa is not what the Yankees need.</p>
        <p>What the Yankees need is another dependable starting pitcher, if not two. What they need is another hitter who will crash some home runs, but not strike out too often. What they need is a principal owner who will forget about trading for a slugger who, for all his home runs, does strike out too much and whose $20 million contract demand might disrupt the clubhouse calm.</p>
        <p>Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams, each with three World Series rings, deserve to be the highest-paid Yankees -- not Sosa, who would be a Yankee-come-lately.</p>
        <p>With the Cubs, a franchise that has been rebuilding almost annually since 1908, when it last won the World Series, the Sosa headlines have emphasized his home runs (20 this season) because at Wrigley Field that's about all there is to emphasize.</p>
        <p>His strikeouts (82 this season) are mostly ignored, because the Cubs now are next to last in the National League Central after finishing in the cellar last season.</p>
        <p>In Sosa's home run duels with Mark McGwire, who hit 70 and 66 the last two seasons, Sosa's 171 strikeouts each year were even more than McGwire's 155 and 141 strikeouts.</p>
        <p>Over their history, the Yankees have been synonymous with home runs, but none of their Hall of Fame sluggers -- Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle and Reggie Jackson -- ever struck out in a season anywhere near as often as Sosa did the last two seasons and this season.</p>
        <p>Ruth's high in strikeouts was 93 in 1923. When he hit 60 homers in 1927, he struck out only 89 times. His career total was only 1,330.</p>
        <p>Gehrig twice led the American League in home runs, with 49 in both 1934 and 1936. He struck out only 31 times in 1934, only 46 times in 1936.</p>
        <p>DiMaggio's ratio of home runs to strikeouts is arguably even more impressive than his 56-game hitting streak. Over his career, DiMaggio hit 361 homers against only 369 strikeouts. In 1941, the year of his hitting streak, he had only 13 strikeouts. In 1939, he had only 20 strikeouts.</p>
        <p>Mantle's career strikeout total of 1,710 ranks ninth all-time, but his season high was 126, in 1959. When he batted .353, slugged 52 homers and drove in 130 runs for the triple crown in 1956, he struck out 99 times.</p>
        <p>Jackson is the career leader in strikeouts with 2,597, but in measuring the Yankees for World Series rings in both 1977 and 1978, he struck out only (for him) 129 and 133 times. He led the league five times in strikeouts, four times with Oakland (he had 171 in 1968, his first full major-league season) and once with California.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees don't need anybody with as many K's in the scorebook as Sammy Sosa.</p>
