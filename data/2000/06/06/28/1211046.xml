        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>PROTEST PLANS MONITORED  Some advance anxiety is on display in Philadelphia, five weeks before the Republican presidential convention, as organizers of a protest march voice suspicions that the police are tracking their plans and photographing them. Some groups have promised extensive protests and possible civil disobedience, while police officials have promised to keep the city orderly for the conventioneers. ''The Secret Service, the F.B.I., the Justice Department and the Philadelphia police have all videotaped our news conferences,'' said Mike Morrill, an organizer of the Unity 2000 protest march planned for July 31, the eve of the convention. There is nothing illegal about that, but Mr. Morrill said the police were ''doing lots of things to intimidate demonstrators in general.'' Police departments routinely gather intelligence in advance of demonstrations. But the Philadelphia American Civil Liberties Union said it would check to see that proper procedures were being followed.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>BIG BREAKFAST FOR BUSH  Gov. George W. Bush of Texas knows how to give a breakfast. By offering scrambled eggs at the River Club overlooking the East River in Manhattan yesterday, he was able to extract $3 million from about  55 donors for the Republican National Committee. Neither the campaign nor the committee would identify any of the people at the event. The location was kept secret from reporters until the event was over. Karen Hughes, Mr. Bush's spokeswoman, said private events were, well, private. This also applies to a lunch that Mr. Bush is to attend today in Cleveland, where each couple will pay $25,000 to raise $1 million for the committee. The breakfast was unusual in that such big-ticket events are rarely held in the morning. (Usually donors get at least lunch.) A Bush fund-raiser said the donors came from across New York State, although most were from Manhattan and many were from Wall Street.</p>

        <p>THE THIRD PARTIES</p>
        <p>ILLINOIS BALLOT GROWS  The two leading third-party presidential hopefuls, Patrick J. Buchanan and Ralph Nader, have filed petitions for a ballot spot in Illinois. Mr. Buchanan, the probable Reform Party nominee, showed up on Monday in Springfield, the capital, to file, saying he had collected some 67,000 signatures from supporters, more than twice the 25,000 required. ''Illinois is a crucial swing state, and if you're not on the ballot in Illinois, you're not a serious candidate,'' he declared. The papers to put Mr. Nader, the Green Party nominee, on the ballot were also filed on Monday, by party officials. Both men say they expect to make the ballot in almost every state by Election Day. The two are still well down in the single digits in most national polls, but in states where Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore are in a tight race, like Illinois, they could be an influential factor.</p>

        <p>THE PRIMARIES</p>
        <p>NEWCOMER BEATS G.O.P. LAWMAKER  Representative Merrill Cook of Utah, who spent two controversial terms in the House, became the first Republican incumbent to lose in a primary this year. He was defeated last night rather easily by Derek W. Smith, a business owner and political neophyte. Mr. Cook, whose district includes most of Salt Lake City and surrounding areas, conceded when about half the 356 precincts had reported and Mr. Smith held almost 60 percent of the vote. Mr. Cook's popularity in the district faded steadily after a series of episodes that included temper tantrums, staff turnovers, a jury finding that he owed a former consultant almost $200,000 and most recently, a boisterous encounter with Mr. Smith on a Salt Lake City sidewalk. In Utah's Republican primary race for governor, the incumbent, Michael O. Leavitt turned back another newcomer, Glen Davis, winning about 60 percent of the vote.</p>
