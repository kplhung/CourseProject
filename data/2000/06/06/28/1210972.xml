        <p>A former Brooklyn police officer was sentenced yesterday to 15 years and eight months in prison for taking part in the savage assault on Abner Louima and plotting to cover up his role in the attack.

        <p>A former Brooklyn police officer was sentenced yesterday to 15 years and eight months in prison for taking part in the savage assault on Abner Louima and plotting to cover up his role in the attack. Two other former officers convicted with him in the cover-up scheme were sentenced to five years in prison each at the same impassioned, two-hour hearing.</p>
        <p>The first officer, Charles Schwarz, who faced a life term, had steadfastly denied that he was anywhere near the bathroom of the 70th Precinct station house in Flatbush when Mr. Louima was sodomized there with a broken broom handle on Aug. 9, 1997.</p>
        <p>Reading with somber indignity from his notes, Mr. Schwarz told Judge Eugene H. Nickerson, who has presided over the case since it began, that he would not ask for a light sentence because he was innocent.</p>
        <p>''I am not even going to ask you, Judge Nickerson, to consider leniency,'' Mr. Schwarz said, lifting his eyes to meet the judge's gaze. ''I have no doubt in my mind that you will give me a harsh sentence. I refuse to demean myself and beg for mercy for a crime I did not commit.''</p>
        <p>''I have already spent 384 days in jail, isolated in a six-by-nine cell, 23 hours a day, and it's 384 days too many,'' Mr. Schwarz said.</p>
        <p>The two other former officers, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese, were sentenced to the maximum penalties they faced. Both men addressed the court, telling Judge Nickerson in aggrieved but defiant tones that they had been wrongly accused of lying to the authorities to protect Mr. Schwarz.</p>
        <p>''I will always be known as one of the Louima cops,'' Mr. Bruder said, his eyes blinking, his chin tucked into his chest. ''A very dubious title.''</p>
        <p>Moments later, Mr. Wiese told the judge that although Abner Louima was clearly a victim, so, too, were ''the police officers wrongly accused, our families, and the citizens of New York who lost their faith and trust in  their police department.''</p>
        <p>Judge Nickerson said his decision to hand down a 15-year sentence, rather than a life term, was based on the dangers Mr. Schwarz is likely to face in prison for being a former police officer, the care Mr. Schwarz had given to his brother, a quadriplegic, Mr. Schwarz's military service and years in the New York Police Department and his secondary role in the attack.</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. Schwarz was found guilty of restraining Mr. Louima as another officer, Justin A. Volpe, sodomized him with the broken stick. Mr. Volpe, who later said that Mr.  Wiese, not Mr. Schwarz, was with him during the attack, pleaded guilty and is serving a 30-year prison term.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wiese, too, has said that he -- not Mr. Schwarz -- was the second man in the bathroom that night, but maintains that he was not involved in the attack. Mr. Bruder confirmed that report, but federal prosecutors charged that they lied by giving that account.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's hearing was fraught with raw emotion, especially from the defendants' families and friends. The gallery erupted into wild applause each time the defendants spoke. Judge Nickerson asked three times for silence. Three times his orders were ignored.</p>
        <p>Many of the officers' supporters wore large blue buttons reading, ''Free Chuck Schwarz.'' Some wore T-shirts emblazoned with a boot stomping on the Constitution. On the boot was printed, ''United States Attorney's Office.'' The tensions spilled out of the courtroom to the street in front of Federal District Court in Brooklyn as Mr. Louima's supporters heckled the officers, yelling, ''Torturers!'' and ''You should have gotten life!'' The officers' supporters shouted back, ''Good cops!'' and ''Keep your heads up, guys!''</p>
        <p>The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has advised Mr. Louima throughout his ordeal, spoke to reporters after the hearing, saying he was glad that Mr. Schwarz was in prison, but added that 15 years was not long enough. As Mr. Sharpton walked away, he was confronted by an elderly white woman making her way through the crowd with a cane. She called out that he, too, should be in jail. The reverend turned to her, thrusting his arms back and his chest out, shouting, ''What are you going to do? Just run your mouth?''</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters, Mr. Louima, who was present at the hearing, said he was disappointed by Mr. Schwarz's sentence. ''I was hoping for the maximum,'' he said. ''But justice was served. I hope the sentence today sends a clear message: that no one is above the law.''</p>
        <p>Ronald Fischetti, Mr. Schwarz's lawyer, said, ''This is a terribly sad day. A sad day for Chuck Schwarz. A sad day for his wife, Andra. A sad day for each and every one us.'' Mr. Fischetti -- along with Mr. Wiese's lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, and Mr. Bruder's lawyer, Stuart London -- said they were confident the convictions would be overturned on appeal.</p>
        <p>Speaking inside the courtroom, Alan Vinegrad, the chief prosecutor, summed up the government's response by saying that the Louima case has been a tragedy for everyone involved -- the victim, the defendants, the Police Department and the citizens of New York.</p>
        <p>There was a time, Mr. Vinegrad said, ''when a police officer's word was presumed to be the truth. A police officer's credibility was the foundation of our criminal justice system.''</p>
        <p>He went on, saying the three men sentenced yesterday ''have helped create an atmosphere in which it is harder for people to accept and trust and believe the word of a cop. That's an enormous tragedy.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 29, 2000, Thursday  A picture caption yesterday about the sentencing of three former New York City police officers for their roles in the assault on Abner Louima reversed the names of two of the ex-officers. Thomas Wiese was in the foreground of the left picture, and Thomas Bruder was at right in the center picture.</p>
