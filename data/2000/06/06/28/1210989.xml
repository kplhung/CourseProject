        <p>Javier Sotomayor, the Cuban world record-holder in the high jump and the only person to leap eight feet, was suspended yesterday for a positive drug test and barred from competing in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, track and field's international governing body announced.</p>
        <p>Sotomayor, the 1992 Olympic champion, who has jumped 8 feet  1/2 inch, tested positive for cocaine at the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and was stripped of first place.</p>
        <p>Cuban sports officials declined to suspend the 32-year-old Sotomayor, saying that his urine sample had been manipulated. But in international sports, it is up to the athlete to prove his or her innocence in a doping offense, which Sotomayor was unable to do before an arbitration panel of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, which is based in Monaco.</p>
        <p>The two-year suspension from international competition is retroactive to last summer and will remain in effect until July 30, 2001.</p>
        <p>In the past, he would have been subjected to a four-year suspension, but the I.A.A.F. has reduced its most severe punishment in doping offenses to two years after losing several right-to-work cases in court.</p>
        <p>''The international bodies of sport assume always in a positive case that you are guilty, and the burden of proof that something was manipulated is on the shoulders of the athletes,'' said Georgio Reineri, a spokesman for the I.A.A.F.</p>
        <p>Next week, another I.A.A.F. arbitration panel is expected to rule on an appeal of a suspension by Merlene Ottey, a multiple world and Olympic medalist from Jamaica, who tested positive for the steroid nandrolone, Reineri said.</p>
        <p>The I.A.A.F.'s doping commission will also probably review the case of Dieter Baumann, the German distance runner who won the 5,000 meters at the 1992 Summer Olympics and who also tested positive for nandrolone last year.</p>
        <p>The German track federation last week lifted its ban of Baumann, who promptly qualified for the Sydney Games. But he must receive clearance from the I.A.A.F. before he can compete internationally. Reineri said the I.A.A.F. could refer the case to arbitration if it did not agree that the suspension should be lifted.</p>
        <p>Nandrolone, which has been easily detectable for years, has surfaced in recent months in several cases. Some athletes and scientists believe that it is being consumed in nutritional supplements that are not properly labeled.</p>
        <p>Baumann, who has been outspoken against drug use, has said that someone tried to sabotage his career by spiking his toothpaste with nandrolone.</p>
