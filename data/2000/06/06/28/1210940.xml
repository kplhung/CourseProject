        <p>When the Nautical Meets the Political</p>
        <p>Put this in the it's-nice-to-have-spouses-in-high-places category.</p>
        <p>On July 4, HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON will be in the heart of the camera-friendly patriotic action twice: by day in New York Harbor for the parade of tall ships, and by night in Washington for the fireworks.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's daytime appearance seems particularly propitious, given her current campaign for the United States Senate. She will accompany President Clinton, who will travel to New York to greet the warships and windjammers. The Clintons will first board the naval vessel Hue City and will then be transferred to the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy to view the parade.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton will be front and center throughout this high-profile exercise in pageantry, one that will provide lots of Kodak moments, not to mention network-quality video moments at no cost to her campaign, though her aides insisted yesterday that her presence at the nautical maneuvers would not be a political maneuver: she would be on hand as first lady, they said, not as a candidate.</p>
        <p>And REPRESENTATIVE RICK A. LAZIO, the Suffolk County Republican who is running against her in the Senate race? Mr. Lazio does not expect to be anywhere near New York Harbor on that day. Instead, he will be in the midst of another bus trip, taking him around New York State. An aide to Mr. Lazio would not comment on Mrs. Clinton's plans.</p>
        <p>Perhaps a Baby Sometimes Forgets</p>
        <p>SHANA ALEXANDER'S book ''The Astonishing Elephant'' begins with a chapter recalling the birth of an elephant at the zoo in Portland, Ore., an event she trumpeted in a cover story in Life magazine when it finally happened in 1962 after a 22-month pregnancy.</p>
        <p>Fast-forward to a few weeks ago, when Ms. Alexander was in Portland for the usual autograph signings that authors do on book tours.</p>
        <p>''One of the keepers felt it important that I have private time with Packy,'' Ms. Alexander said. ''I didn't feel it, but he did. My time was tightly planned: dinner with the new zoo man and his wife and the new keeper. The keeper was careful to tell me, 'I'm going to get you some time with Packy.' ''</p>
        <p>Off she went to the zoo for her private time with Packy -- all 14,000 pounds of him.</p>
        <p>''This man believed Packy would know me,'' Ms. Alexander said. ''I didn't believe it. I don't know if my dogs know me. I don't think he knew me. This was a monster. When I first saw him, he was 230 pounds.''</p>
        <p>Reunion Precedes The Graduation</p>
        <p>AMELIA KOTTE -- grade point average of 97.53, SAT score of 1,220, captain of the soccer team -- gave the valedictorian's speech at Christopher Columbus High School in the Bronx yesterday. Her mother was in the audience.</p>
        <p>It might sound like just another high school graduation, except that the mother, IRMA GJERGA, had arrived on Monday from Albania. Ms. Kotte, who arrived in this country five years ago, lives with an uncle in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Also in the audience was JOHN SCHWARTZ, senior vice president of European American Bank in Uniondale, N.Y., who met Ms. Kotte after she gave a speech at an awards dinner on June 1.</p>
        <p>''She thanked her family and educators and coaches, she particularly thanked her mother and then she broke down and cried,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''She went on to say she has not seen her mother in the five years she has been in this country.'' After the speech, he handed her his business card and said: ''If you think of anything I can do, call me.''</p>
        <p>She did not wait to call. She said her mother needed a visa by graduation day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz called GEORGE FARRELL, a lawyer and director of the bank who has done volunteer work in the Balkans. He made some calls, and eventually he gave Mr. Schwartz the name of someone at the United States Embassy. Mr. Schwartz sent an e-mail message.</p>
        <p>The visa came through last week, and Mr. Schwartz drove Ms. Kotte to Kennedy International Airport on Monday to meet her mother's plane. ''We set up this situation where she had a VCR camera, which I was going to shoot for her, and if she stood in a certain place I could get them both as her mother came out,'' he said. ''But she sees her mother in this hallway, goes under the rope, runs down the hallway and embraces her.''</p>
