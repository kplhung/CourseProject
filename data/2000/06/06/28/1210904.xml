        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''A Firehouse Tradition Gives Way, Uneasily'' (news article, June 22) casts volunteer firefighters as the opposite of professionals. This is simply not the case. Whether they take a check home twice a month or never get paid for the countless hours of dedicated service, firefighters are all professionals.</p>
        <p>In my seven years as a volunteer firefighter, I have worked alongside some of the most dedicated and professional firefighters both paid and volunteer in Nassau County and in Montgomery County, Md.</p>
        <p>It is true that firehouse membership across the county is low, and finding recruits can be difficult. Calling one group ''professional'' at the other's expense will only worsen this divide at a time when both groups need to be working together more closely and strengthening each other.</p>
