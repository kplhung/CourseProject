        <p>The ''Survivor'' connection to CBS News will be extended next week when the news magazine program ''48 Hours'' broadcasts a segment featuring two of that adventure  show's contestants in an edition devoted to the subject ''The Price of Fame.''</p>
        <p>The segment, which will offer a profile of two of the people who signed up to compete for a $1 million prize on ''Survivor,'' the hit CBS summer series, will be one of four reports on the program exploring the lengths to which Americans are willing to go to to achieve some measure of fame. The program, normally seen on Thursday nights at 10, is to run as a special next Wednesday at 10. There will also be a Thursday edition.</p>
        <p>That Wednesday is the same night that ''Survivor'' will be broadcasting its fifth episode at 8, leading in directly to the first episode of CBS's other heavily publicized summer reality series, ''Big Brother,'' at 9 p.m.</p>
        <p>Both shows have already become closely tied to CBS News, mainly through regular features on ''The Early Show.'' The news announcer from that show, Julie Chen, will participate directly in ''Big Brother,'' supplying the voice that will tell the contestants in the competition which one of them has been banished each  week.</p>
        <p>Ms. Chen's role in ''Big Brother'' has initiated concerns within some quarters of CBS News that ratings concerns are eliminating barriers between news and entertainment.</p>
        <p>Susan Zirinsky, the executive producer of ''48 Hours,'' said that the ''Survivor'' segment on her news program had nothing to do with a network-wide promotional push for the reality shows.</p>
        <p>''Nobody from the entertainment division suggested I do this,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But she said that she had long planned to do a show on fame and that the ''Survivor'' participants seemed a natural fit with that theme. ''These are people who agreed to go to this island because they are lusting after fame,'' Ms. Zirinsky said. ''We're looking to answer the question: why are these people willing to do these things?''</p>
        <p>The idea for the fame program began, Ms. Zirinsky said, when a ''48 Hours'' crew was following an 11-year-old singer, Sammie Bush. The program trailed him for a year, during which he did in fact emerge as a young singing sensation.</p>
        <p>The program will also present profiles of the actors who starred in the award winning ''Whass-up?'' commercials for Budweiser.</p>
        <p>Almost inevitably, Ms. Zirinsky is also including an interview with Darva Conger, who exploded into fame on the year's most discredited reality show, ''Who Wants To Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' and then spent months disdaining that performance in interview and is now topping off the collision with fame by appearing nude in Playboy.</p>
        <p>''People seem to believe they have an inalienable right to be famous,'' Ms. Zirinsky said.</p>
        <p>As for the chances that her program might be accused of being swept up in the ''Survivor'' tidal wave sweeping CBS, Ms. Zirinsky said: ''I don't think that would be fair. We're doing an honest deal here on fame. I still believe in the total separation of church and state.''</p>
