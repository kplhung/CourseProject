        <p>New York Apple Tours' red double-decker buses, which have been banished from the city's streets for nearly a month, may be rolling again as early as this weekend. On Monday, a panel of state appellate judges rejected an attempt by the city and state to sideline the buses while they try to shut the company down permanently.</p>
        <p>The company, which has racked up hundreds of regulatory and safety violations and accidents in its nine years of ferrying tourists around the city, has been under siege by the authorities and residents since May 22, when one of its buses struck and  killed a 71-year-old pedestrian in Midtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Even before the accident, the State Department of Motor Vehicles and the city Department of Consumer Affairs had started administrative hearings to revoke New York Apple's licenses. But on May 31, Governor George E. Pataki issued an order pulling the registration of the company's 63 buses pending the outcome of the hearings.</p>
        <p>New York Apple challenged the order, saying it violated its rights to due process, and on June 14, a State Supreme Court judge in Manhattan agreed. Judge Phyllis Gangel-Jacob reversed the governor's order, although she also appointed a former city official to monitor the company.</p>
        <p>The city and state immediately appealed the ruling, forcing the buses to stay off the road until the appellate ruling on Monday.</p>
        <p>The state and city both said yesterday that they would abide by the appellate panel's ruling, which rejected their appeal.</p>
        <p>''We disagree with the decision, but we will comply and will work closely with the monitor to ensure  the safety of the pedestrians and motorists of New York City,'' Suzanne Morris, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>New York Apple's president, Hayim Grant, said the buses would roll again as soon as the company did two things: demonstrated to the court-appointed monitor, Ross Sandler, a former city transportation commissioner, that its buses and drivers are in compliance with safety laws; and found enough employees to get back in business.</p>
        <p>''We have to call over 350 employees that were laid off to convince them to come back to work,'' Mr. Grant said yesterday. ''I'm sure many have already gotten replacement employment. But we are hopeful that we'll be back on the road by this weekend.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Grant said New York Apple officials planned to meet with Mr. Sandler last night to ''to determine what steps we need to take before we can operate again.'' Mr. Sandler could not be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>New York Apple's problems with the authorities escalated on May 22, when one of its drivers, who was not licensed to operate a bus, made an illegal turn onto West 45th Street and ran over and killed Randolph Walker, an actor walking home from an audition.</p>
        <p>The accident galvanized neighborhood opposition, which had been building for years, and the authorities reacted by pulling the company's licenses.</p>
        <p>But in her ruling last week, Judge Gangel-Jacob said letting the buses continue to operate would ''not do any harm to any public interest,'' while shutting the company without a full trial would hurt the company and its employees and could damage the city's tourism industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grant said he was pleased with the ruling, which was not accompanied by any comments from the justices.</p>
        <p>''We feel that we're entitled to a proper defense before we're shut down,'' he said. ''We've been serving visitors to New York for close to 10 years now, we're the leader in the industry, and to shut us down without a proper hearing and defense we felt was not constitutional.''</p>
