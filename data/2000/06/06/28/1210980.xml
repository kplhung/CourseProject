        <p>U.S. Goes to Court to Stop WorldCom Deal for Sprint  The Justice Department sought an injunction in federal court against WorldCom's proposed $115 billion acquisition of Sprint, citing concerns that the combined company would stifle competition on the Internet and in the long-distance telephone industry.</p>
