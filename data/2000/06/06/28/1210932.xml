        <p>Now that decipherment of the human genome has been so grandly trumpeted, practical and highly personal questions inevitably arise. What difference will this make to me? How soon will it help or hurt me? The answers were not always easy to discern in the torrent of commentary after Monday's triumphal announcement that a public consortium of academic institutions and a private company had each determined the exact sequence of the vast majority of chemical letters in the human genetic material. It is those letters that determine, when strung together as genes, how all the cells in the human body develop and function. In the commonly used metaphor, the genome is a blueprint for life.</p>
        <p>In the long run, there seems no question that deciphering the genome will help propel research and medicine to a deeper level of understanding.  Using so-called gene expression chips, scientists will be able to detect which genes are active in a heart cell and which are active in a kidney cell, shedding light on what makes those cells develop differently. They will also be able to compare gene activity in normal cells and cancer cells, in an effort to identify all the genes involved in causing the cancer and then to find a way to intervene at the molecular level. That would leave today's primary treatments for cancer -- cutting the cancer out, or zapping it with radiation, or hitting it with a toxic brew of chemicals -- looking like crude and barbaric relics of a less sophisticated past.</p>

        <p>Now that decipherment of the human genome has been so grandly trumpeted, practical and highly personal questions inevitably arise. What difference will this make to me? How soon will it help or hurt me? The answers were not always easy to discern in the torrent of commentary after Monday's triumphal announcement that a public consortium of academic institutions and a private company had each determined the exact sequence of the vast majority of chemical letters in the human genetic material.

        <p>In the long run, there seems no question that deciphering the genome will help propel research and medicine to a deeper level of understanding.  Using so-called gene expression chips, scientists will be able to detect which genes are active in a heart cell and which are active in a kidney cell, shedding light on what makes those cells develop differently.

That would leave today's primary treatments for cancer -- cutting the cancer out, or zapping it with radiation, or hitting it with a toxic brew of chemicals -- looking like crude and barbaric relics of a less sophisticated past.</p>
        <p>But what is often lost in the excitement is how long the process of discovery may take. Everyone expects some medical breakthroughs, in the form of drugs or diagnostic tests based on the new genetic understandings, to emerge in the next 5 to 10 years, but no one can say for certain just what the breakthroughs will be. Dr. Francis Collins, head of the publicly funded Human Genome Project, hazarded a guess that within the next decade there will be tests to tell people what genetically influenced diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, they are at increased risk for, and that in 15 to 20 years drugs will be targeted on the precise molecular problem contributing to, say, cancer or mental illness. But Dr. Collins seemed much less sanguine about manipulating the aging process to extend the human life span, calling that far less certain to happen over the next 40 to 50 years, though it could.</p>
        <p>Nobody really knows. Indeed, the truth is that simply knowing the exact sequence of chemical units in the human genetic material does not tell scientists much about how the genes function, how they interact with each other, or what proteins they produce to catalyze events in the body's cells. The proteins are the real center of interest in biology and the most likely targets of drug treatments. Their mysteries will be far harder to penetrate than was the genome. That is why eminent biologists have been saying there is a century of work ahead.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, having the entire genome laid out on computer databases will be a great advantage because researchers can search for relevant genes at speeds unimagined in the recent past. At Monday's ceremonies, key scientists in the genome work recounted how genes that took a decade of hard work to find in the 1980's could be found today by a single postgraduate student in anywhere from 15 seconds to two weeks, just by searching a database. That enormous amplification of research power alone warrants all the exuberance over the genome project.</p>
