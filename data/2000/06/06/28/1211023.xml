        <p>An Alberta court has approved a proposal by Canadian Airlines to settle with creditors holding 3.5 billion Canadian dollars ($2.4 billion) worth of debt, paving the way for its integration with Air Canada of Montreal. Canadian Airlines was bought by its larger and healthier rival in January for 92 million Canadian dollars, or about $63 million, and in March was forced to seek protection from creditors. Under the court-approved restructuring plan, Canadian Airlines' secured creditors will get 97 percent of what they are owed, while unsecured creditors will get 14 percent. The Calgary-based carrier's chief executive, Paul Brotto, said integration with Air Canada could come this year.</p>
