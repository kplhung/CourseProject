        <p>In 1985, 20 years after the blackout that plunged much of the Northeast into darkness, New York commemorated the anniversary with a festival called Urban Light. Among the enthusiastic participants, even though it would not formally open for another year, was the International Design Center in Long Island City, Queens, for which the architectural firm of I. M. Pei &amp; Partners designed the master plan.</p>
        <p>Yet five years after its opening, the $150 million design center was itself nearly plunged into darkness, not from a power failure but from an exodus of tenants. The showrooms and shops in the center and the developer, the Lazard Development Corporation, had badly overestimated the willingness of  design companies and their customers to make the leap across the East River from Manhattan.</p>
        <p>But after several false starts, multiple owners and bankruptcy, the lights are back on at the center. Now, however, the one-million-square-foot complex is known as the Queens Atrium Corporate Center, and the center's two buildings, at 30-20 and 30-30 Thomson Avenue, are fully leased to corporations and city agencies.</p>
        <p>When MCI Worldcom Network Services recently asked for more space in the center -- in addition to the 260,000 square feet it had leased for 15 years toward the end of 1999 -- Insignia/ESG, the center's leasing and management agent, was able to accommodate the request only by buying out a tenant.</p>
        <p>''Through the 90's, the center was only 40 to 50 percent occupied,'' said Richard Karson, executive director of Insignia/ESG. ''And right before we were hired to reposition the property at the end of 1996, the building was in danger of losing its biggest tenant, whose lease was set to expire.''</p>
        <p>One of the buildings in the complex, a 6-story, 500,000-square-foot structure constructed in 1919, had already been through any number of changes. Perhaps the most visible came when the American Chicle Company moved its factory and headquarters there from Manhattan in 1923. American Chicle remained there for 48 years, its huge rooftop signs, proclaiming the company's Chiclets and Dentyne brands, dominating the Long Island City skyline.</p>
        <p>When Lazard Development, a subsidiary of Lazard Freres &amp; Company, the investment banking firm, began developing the site in the early 1980's, at the urging of New York City officials and after a $23 million federal urban development action grant, it added an atrium and full-length skylight to the former American Chicle building and added an atrium to the neighboring 8-story, 450,000-square-foot Bucilla Building, which was built in 1914.</p>
        <p>The original intent was to convert the buildings into offices, showrooms and retail shops for furniture, lighting and accessories in a single, convenient location, just across the Queensboro Bridge from Manhattan. The consensus of investors, tenants and the city fathers was that the combination of easy access, rents 20 percent to 60 percent less than comparable space in Manhattan and generous tax breaks would add up to a sure thing. Mr. Pei predicted, ''We will have one-stop design shopping.''</p>
        <p>The way things turned out, ''no-stop shopping'' would have been more accurate. As one visitor described it in 1991, ''the center looks like an archaeological site.''</p>
        <p>Adam H. Foster, managing director of Insignia/ESG, said many people had a psychological block about being so close to Manhattan without actually being there -- a mind-set that still poses a problem for his brokers. ''When we were trying to interest tenants in the corporate center,'' he said, ''our biggest problem was getting chief financial officers and other decision makers to come over the bridge or jump on the subway.''</p>
        <p>As recently as a year or two ago, Mr. Foster said, before commercial rental space became so scarce and expensive in Manhattan, ''we had companies turn down coming here even though it would cost them $10 million to $15 million more a year to be in Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>From the beginning, the repositioning plan consisted of going after tenants who needed lots of space, instead of the warrens that were there in the buildings' previous incarnation. In addition, Insignia/ESG obtained a package of financial incentives from the New York City Economic Development Corporation for qualifying tenants. So while annual rents for the corporate center run in the mid-$20's per square foot, the incentives typically bring it down to the high teens.</p>
        <p>Despite the corporate center's name, the space is almost evenly divided between corporate tenants and New York City agencies. Those agencies are the New York City School Construction Authority, which recently signed a 12-year renewal lease; the Department of Transportation and the Department of Design and Construction. Together, the three take up about 95 percent of the space in Center One, the handsome six-story building.</p>
        <p>The revived fortunes of the corporate center received a big boost in 1998 (a year after Oaktree Capital Management of Los Angeles bought the buildings from the Bank of New York) when the DeVry Institute of Technology, based in Illinois, was looking to expand its chain of 18 colleges into New York.</p>
        <p>''DeVry was chasing several deals in Manhattan,'' Mr. Foster said, ''but as prices there rose, they kept losing out on them. So we contacted their broker, and they wound up taking two floors and an option on a third.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Karson of Insignia/ESG said the school was attracted to the Queens Atrium Corporate Center for the same reasons most of the corporate tenants were, and because it was only a block from  CUNY's La Guardia Community College. DeVry opened in the corporate center in the fall of 1998 with 500 students; last fall's count was 1,200.</p>
        <p>''Now that rental space is almost impossible to find at any price in Manhattan, corporations aren't as reluctant to come here,'' Mr. Karson said, pointing toward a number of nearby buildings with corporate tenants. And with both buildings of the Queens Atrium Corporate Center sold out, he lamented, ''if only we had another half-million square feet to rent.''</p>
