        <p>The scene prompts amused, head-shaking, eye-blinking wonder: the Beatles, the Fab Four themselves, sharing heart-to-hearts with the Monkees, the Prefab Four, about the perils of fame and the burdens of talent.</p>
        <p>That actually happened. The inventive American entertainment machine sculptured four strangers into a band that parodied the Beatles but ultimately shared their pop universe. ''Daydream Believers: The Monkees Story,'' a smart and cheerful movie on VH1 tonight, dramatizes the wildly improbable ride of this manufactured band.</p>
        <p>The Monkees were conceived in 1965 as a gimmick: Take the madcap style of the Beatles' film ''A Hard Day's Night,'' adapt it for television and mix in talents like the filmmakers Bob Rafelson and Paul Mazursky, all designed to tap into the nation's Beatlemania. ''You give me a free hand,'' the pop impresario Don Kirshner says in the film, ''and I'll have 'em outselling the Beatles in six months.''</p>
        <p>Who would have expected this idea to yield chart-topping hits, a movie written by Jack Nicholson and audiences with the Beatles? Not even the Monkees themselves. At first they seem delighted just to have jobs. Yet ''Daydream Believers'' makes clear how this puppet group gained its own life, thanks to the unlikely chemistry of its members.</p>
        <p>Mike Nesmith (Jeff Geddis) and Peter Tork (L. B. Fisher) are budding musicians; Micky Dolenz (Aaron Lohr) and Davy Jones (George Stanchev) are workmanlike actors. All four need an opportunity and respond to the open casting call for a proposed television comedy titled ''The Monkees.''</p>
        <p>''Daydream Believers'' makes the series the brainchild of a somewhat composite character, Van Foreman (Colin Ferguson in an intelligent performance), using the musical guidance of Kirshner (Wallace Langham, who makes the role far more biting than Paul Shaffer's familiar ''Saturday Night Live'' caricature). Kirshner is promised total creative control of the Monkees' sound, well before the band members are cast.</p>
        <p>That control doesn't sit well with Mike, who chafes at Kirshner's use of studio musicians for the band's songs. ''Daydream Believers'' portrays Mike as arrogant but somewhat innocent in his belief that the Monkees can transcend the marketing forces that made them.</p>
        <p>And in their desire for respect as a band, the Monkees seem to dismiss a large part of their success: their Emmy Award-winning comic ensemble and the appealing personalities it offered, all based on the performers themselves and bearing their real names. By movie's end, with their television series canceled, the Monkees seem to appreciate what they achieved, too late.</p>
        <p>''Daydream Believers'' has cast the Monkees with look-alikes (aside from Mr. Lohr's Micky) who give subtle honesty to what could have been rote performances. Mr. Fisher makes the intriguing Peter both sweet and compellingly earnest; Mr. Geddis captures Mike's style with relaxed clarity; and Mr. Lohr makes a likable individual of Micky, the television show's broadest talent but the television film's least developed Monkee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stanchev's Davy is the center of this story. He clearly portrays Davy's growing isolation from the other Monkees, who embrace the rock 'n' roll life while he struggles to remain an actor though he has become a phenomenon.</p>
        <p>The film's strong acting and thematic focus trump its sometimes sketchy and formulaic dialogue. Nonetheless, the boldest moment of ''Daydream Believers'' is the script's: an opening scene in which a contemporary man tries to sell a laptop-obsessed executive on the ''cutting edge'' idea of a show about a band, a scene that segues into the series' 1965 pitch. The scene's apparent aim is to introduce the Monkees to an audience familiar with today's Backstreet Boys and similar manufactured acts.</p>
        <p>There's a big difference, however, between then and now. Can anyone imagine the Backstreet Boys as stars of a weekly comedy series? The Monkees may not have been the Beatles, but as ''Daydream'' seems to believe, they honestly earned their places in pop history.</p>
        <p>DAYDREAM BELIEVERS  The Monkees Story VH1, tonight at 9</p>
        <p>Written by Ron McGee; Susan Murdoch, producer; Neill Fearnley, director; Joanne Jackson, production manager; Marie-Claude Harnois, production coordinator.</p>
        <p>WITH: George Stanchev (Davy), Aaron Lohr (Micky), Jeff Geddis (Mike), L. B. Fisher (Peter), Colin Ferguson (Van Foreman), Stephen Bogaert (Harris Green) and Wallace Langham (Don Kirshner).</p>
