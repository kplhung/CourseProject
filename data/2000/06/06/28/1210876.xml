        <p>MEASURING spoons have a clear purpose and a simple design that you would think should be foolproof. And yet, aside from the food processor with all its parts, there may be no other tool that can be more of a pain in the neck to use and clean. There are those bound by an inseparable ring, so that every time you use one, you must clean them all. There are others with seams that catch specks of flour or grease, and those that inevitably spill their contents when set down on a counter.</p>
        <p>CuisiPro, in New Castle, Del., did something about these problems. Its spoon set is held together by a ring with a separable joint. Each spoon is made of a single piece of stainless steel, so there are no seams, and has a long, narrow head to fit into all sorts of bottles and jars. The most innovative feature, though, is a handle that curves downward at the end, so when you put a spoon down, it sits level.</p>

        <p>The spoons also have gentle curves and a nice heft. Why not have something that's pleasurable to hold as you dutifully measure something down to the last eighth of a teaspoon?</p>
        <p>CuisiPro measuring spoons are $6.98 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street), (212) 787-2000. For locations of other stores: (302) 326-4802.</p>
