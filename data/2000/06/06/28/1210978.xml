        <p>A prisoner with a history of violence escaped from Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx early yesterday after what officials suspect was a feigned seizure, and the three veteran corrections officers who were guarding him have been suspended without pay pending an investigation.</p>
        <p>The man who escaped, Jamel Hightower, 24, who until his transfer to the hospital was being held at the Bronx House of Detention awaiting trial on charges of attempted murder and robbery, was still at large last night. A $1,000 reward was offered for information leading to his capture.</p>
        <p>A preliminary investigation indicated that two of his guards had slipped away to have something to eat, and the third had fallen asleep in the hall outside the prisoner's hospital room, said a jail official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The guards were all officers with 10 to 21 years of service.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Hightower, of the Bronx, was taken from the jail to the Bronx Courthouse for a routine court appearance. There, in the holding area behind the courtroom, Mr. Hightower ''took a seizure,'' said Thomas Antenen, a spokesman for the Department of Correction.</p>
        <p>It appeared that the seizure, coming as it did when Mr. Hightower was out of reach of the jail's security and medical staff, could have been a ruse. ''We would look at it as very convenient that on his day in court, he had a seizure,'' Mr. Antenen said.</p>
        <p>The prisoner, dressed in jeans and a white T-shirt, was taken to Lincoln Hospital. Procedure calls for two officers to accompany prisoners to the hospital. Prisoners are supposed to have their feet shackled together when moving around the hospital, and to have one foot shackled to the  bed while in a room.</p>
        <p>Because Mr. Hightower was known to be dangerous, three officers were sent, Mr. Antenen said, so two would always be on guard. He said it was customary for guards to stand outside hospital rooms.</p>
        <p>At 6 a.m., Mr. Antenen said, the prisoner may have asked to go to the bathroom. It is not clear whether a guard released him from his restraints. ''At some point those shackles came off,'' Mr. Antenen said, ''and the inmate just bolted out of the room, made his way from the eighth floor to the first floor to the emergency room exit, and went out into the street.''</p>
        <p>The three guards, Chet Outten, Cleveland Wilson and Joseph Shanley, gave conflicting accounts of what happened, Mr. Antenen said. But there was no doubt that rules had been broken. ''This is a major breach of departmental policy,'' he said. ''It goes to the heart of what we do, really, providing security for inmates.'' A fourth employee, who was in charge of arranging security for the prisoner, was also suspended. His  name was not released pending his notification.</p>
        <p>The police are now searching for Mr. Hightower, and a phone line for tips, (718) 546-1525, has been set up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hightower was being held on charges filed in connection with a gun battle with the police in April.  The police said he stabbed two people in a Bronx apartment, then later  opened fire on a police car. In the ensuing gun battle, a bystander was shot and seriously injured. He remains in the hospital.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hightower fled, leading the police on a wild chase and holding a bus driver and a woman on a train platform at gunpoint along the way, the police said. He was caught trying  to climb a railroad station fence.</p>
        <p>At the time, he was on parole for two attacks in 1994 in which he robbed and sexually abused women  in Manhattan elevators.</p>
        <p>The parole board denied his parole twice, but he was released by the prison system for good behavior on March 15. Six weeks later, the stabbings, which police said were drug-related, occurred.</p>
