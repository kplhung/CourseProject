        <p>An environmental group that helped broker a 1997 agreement exempting New York City from building a $6 billion water filtration plant said today that it would sue the city to try to scuttle that agreement.</p>
        <p>Riverkeeper, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Garrison, N.Y., said the city had failed to take enough measures to assure the quality of drinking water from its upstate reservoirs.</p>
        <p>The group said it would seek to invalidate New York's agreement with the federal Environmental Protection Agency because two of the city's largest reservoirs are threatened by pollutants from the growing commercial development in northern Westchester and Putnam Counties.</p>
        <p>''If you lose these reservoirs, you lose the whole system,'' said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the chief lawyer for Riverkeeper.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy said he notified city officials last week that he would file the lawsuit in Federal District Court in White Plains. He said the lawsuit would not seek any money but would ask the court to direct city and federal environmental officials to adopt more stringent measures to protect the water system.</p>
        <p>Charles G. Sturcken, chief of staff for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, would not comment specifically on Riverkeeper's complaints, but he emphasized that the city had made many improvements to its water system in the three years since the agreement took effect.</p>
        <p>''We meet every month with the federal government, which is like our teacher and principal here,'' he said. ''And they would tell us if we were failing or passing. So far we're passing.''</p>
        <p>In the 1997 agreement, New York City and communities around the reservoirs in the so-called Catskills water system, which provides 90 percent of the city's drinking water, pledged to undertake a series of costly actions, like installing new equipment in sewage plants that discharge treated waste water into the reservoirs and buying land to prevent development that could let chemicals enter the water.</p>
        <p>In return, the federal agency has allowed the city to maintain an unfiltered water supply, the largest in the country. But if the city does not follow through on its part of the agreement, the agency will require it to filter its drinking water from the Catskills reservoirs beginning in May 2002.</p>
        <p>As part of a separate court settlement with the federal agency, the city has reached a commitment to build a $600 million filtration plant for its other major line of reservoirs, the Croton system, farther to the east.</p>
        <p>Mary Mears, a spokeswoman for the federal agency, said that while the agency agreed with many of Riverkeeper's concerns, it intended to give city officials more time to address them. ''We're on our own timeline,'' she said. ''The city's doing very well in some areas, but we're particularly concerned with their progress in others.''</p>
        <p>Last month, in its first comprehensive review of the water system since the 1997 agreement, the federal agency said city officials had fallen far behind in their efforts to upgrade 34 sewage plants. The federal agency also said the city had managed to buy only 17 undeveloped acres of the 1,000 available around a crucial reservoir in the Catskills system, the Kensico.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sturcken, the city environmental official, said he expected the work at the sewage plants to proceed more quickly once the initial engineering plans were approved. In addition, he said, since 1997 the city had acquired 11,000 acres around the Catskills reservoirs and had contracts to buy 12,000 more.</p>
        <p>''Nobody has attempted anything on this scale,'' he said. ''And for the two and a half years we've been doing it, I think our marks are pretty good.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kennedy said that much more could be done to protect the watershed. He called for new restrictions on commercial development around the Kensico Reservoir and the West Branch Reservoir in Putnam County, which is also part of the Catskills water system.</p>
        <p>Several environmentalists and state legislators said today that Riverkeeper had refocused attention on a problem that had already been on their minds.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester who heads the environmental conservation committee, said he planned to hold public hearings on the watershed agreement this summer. He said that if necessary, the state could free more resources to buy undeveloped land or take on a larger enforcement role.</p>
        <p>''What you had was a well-conceived model that clearly has run into serious bumps in the implementation process,'' he said. ''The state has been the silent Big Brother in watching this process unfold. If we have to, there is much more we can do on a practical basis.''</p>
