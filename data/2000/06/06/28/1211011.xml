        <p>John Rocker may not be riding the No. 7 train to Shea Stadium after all, but his pending four-day visit remains a headache, and police officials said yesterday that undercover police officers would be in the stands to protect the Atlanta Braves pitcher from unruly fans.</p>
        <p>The deployment of undercover officers is one in a series of strategies the police are planning to ensure that Rocker is not assaulted or injured during a four-game series between the Braves and the Mets, which begins tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>Many of the moves under discussion are designed to protect Rocker should he go through with his avowed plan to travel to Shea on the No. 7 subway line, whose riders are among the New Yorkers he had chosen to belittle.</p>
        <p>But doubt was cast on Rocker's plan last night. In Montreal, Braves Manager Bobby Cox said the Braves had made it clear to Rocker that they did not want him riding the No. 7 train, and Cox seemed to think Rocker would comply. And one of Rocker's teammates -- catcher Javier Lopez -- said flat out that Rocker, who was not talking, would not be on the subway.</p>
        <p>Earlier yesterday, Commissioner Bud Selig, who suspended and fined Rocker for his remarks about foreigners, gays and members of minorities, said he was confident that everything surrounding Rocker's stay in New York would be handled properly.</p>
        <p>''I've talked to the mayor,'' Selig said, referring to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. ''I've talked to the Braves. The Braves are talking to him.''</p>
        <p>Ever since Rocker announced his intention to take the train to the game, baseball officials have said privately they do not believe he will.</p>
        <p>If Rocker does somehow end up on the No. 7 train, police officials said his trip will definitely not feature face-to-face encounters with angry straphangers.</p>
        <p>''The only thing he will be seeing in his car will be police officers,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir said. ''This is like protecting the Ku Klux Klan. You don't want to do it but you have an obligation to protect people from themselves.''</p>
        <p>Police officials said Rocker would be guarded around the clock while he is in New York. During discussions Monday, the police and the baseball supervisors talked of assigning a team of nine police officers to travel with Rocker during any subway trip, but police officials said yesterday that the actual number remained fluid.</p>
        <p>Other security arrangements being discussed included posting an officer at every station of the No. 7 train between Grand Central Terminal and Shea and possibly converting whatever train Rocker got on into an express for the rest of its journey. But many of these preparations now seem moot unless Rocker surprises the Braves and baseball and does end up on a train.</p>
        <p>At the stadium, the police are planning to have as many as 600 officers -- as many as usually patrol a playoff game -- on hand, including several mounted officers to keep fans off the field after the game. Usually the police detail at Shea consists of 45 to 60 officers, depending on attendance, the police said.</p>
        <p>At least one of the undercover officers will be an Atlanta police lieutenant who is traveling with the Braves and will be working at field level in a team uniform to provide an extra level of security for Rocker, the police said.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mets officials have said they plan to erect a covered fence around the bullpen to prevent fans from throwing things at Rocker during the game.</p>
        <p>David Howard, the Mets' senior vice president of business and legal affairs, said mounted police and highway patrol cars would be part of the police deployment at Shea.</p>
