        <p>Russian parliamentary leaders said today that they are appealing to Belarus's autocratic president to allow the country's opposition parties to take part in all aspects of elections this fall.</p>
        <p>The appeal adds significant political weight to the message, already delivered by European leaders, that Russia shares concerns that the future of democracy is under threat in Belarus as repression rises. During the last year, some opposition leaders have disappeared, fled or been jailed on political charges, newspapers have been shut down and journalists have been harassed.</p>
        <p>Last week, a delegation of the European Parliament admonished Belarus's president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, who has led the country of 10 million since his election in 1994, to open talks with opposition parties. European leaders have threatened to withhold sending election observers to Belarus this fall unless Mr. Lukashenko allows opposition party members on the electoral commission that will supervise elections and gives opposition candidates access to the state-controlled news media.</p>
        <p>''We are taking our obligation seriously to do everything in our power to democratize the electoral process in Belarus,'' said Oleg G. Naumov, a member of Russia's Parliament from the reformist Union of Right Forces Party. ''We are trying to avoid any ultimatum because an ultimatum could only lead to the strengthening of the Lukashenko regime. That is the same thing that happened with Milosevic in Yugoslavia.''</p>
        <p>The final draft of the appeal, which was coordinated with but not openly endorsed by the Kremlin, will carry the signatures of Yevgeny Primakov, head of the Fatherland-All Russia Party; Boris Gryzlov, leader of the Unity Party, which is most closely aligned with President Vladimir V. Putin; and the leaders of the Yabloko and Union of Right Forces parties.</p>
        <p>As of this evening, only the Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, had not signed the appeal, but organizers said the Communists might yet sign on before the document is sent to Minsk, the Belarussian capital.</p>
        <p>''We are convinced that the legislation for elections to the Belarussian Parliament must meet international standards, and the vote should be democratic and fair,'' the appeal says. The document calls on Mr. Lukashenko to form electoral commissions with participation of all registered parties and to grant equal access to the state-run media.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lukashenko was here today meeting with Mr. Putin in a session of the Supreme State Council of the union of Belarus and Russia. The union was sealed last December by Mr. Lukashenko and former President Boris N. Yeltsin and though it leaves both countries independent it provides for integration of economic and security policies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin and Mr. Lukashenko made no public comments today about the looming confrontation over the elections in Belarus. In Minsk, Yuri Khodyko, deputy chairman of the opposition People's Front, told reporters that it makes sense to take part in elections that really give the right to choose. But based on Mr. Lukashenko's statements so far, he said, the opposition fears that he is planning to hold a farce, not legitimate elections.</p>
        <p>Belarussian opposition leaders came here last week to seek assistance from liberal party leaders to put pressure on Mr. Lukashenko.</p>
