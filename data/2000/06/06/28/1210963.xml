        <p>Four months ago, with demolition of the New York Coliseum under way, a final design had yet to be approved for Columbus Center, the project that would take its place on a two-block site from 58th to 60th Street. Instead, the developers, their architects and city officials were at an impasse.</p>
        <p>About all they could agree on was this: Columbus Center had become a camel.</p>
        <p>Architectural visions for the Columbus Circle site had begun with a gargantuan prism in 1985, and evolved into an over scaled Central Park West apartment tower in 1988 and then a glass-sheathed echo of Deco in 1998.</p>
        <p>But by February, as the development group and a mayoral design advisory panel were negotiating over the percentage of stone in the facade, the vision had turned into two boxy towers; a horse designed by committee.</p>
        <p>''Everybody's common denominator was not a good plan,'' said the chief architect, David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill.</p>
        <p>With little time to lose, Mr. Childs drew up a new plan. The 55-story, 750-foot towers would shed their stone for broad planes of sheer glass. Shaped like parallelograms, they would skew to Broadway's angle. They would rise from a curved seven-story base hugging Columbus Circle, with a prow at one end announcing the presence of the company formed by the merger of America Online and Time Warner, and a midblock atrium, where 59th Street once ran, topped by a glass-walled performance space for Jazz at Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>''When I saw it, I liked it immediately,'' said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is to unveil the design today at Columbus Circle. Mr. Giuliani gave credit to the five-member panel of civic leaders, architects and planners that advised him on ''what they thought was the most beautiful and aesthetically pleasing project.''</p>
        <p>''It worked very well,'' he said of the review process.</p>
        <p>Asked about the occasional tumult that resulted, Mr. Giuliani laughed. ''Luckily, I wasn't a part of it,'' he said. ''Usually I'm in the middle of these things. By having a committee come to me, sometimes with Band-Aids on their faces, I didn't know about all the fighting. I just got the end result.''</p>
        <p>After much pushing and pulling -- as well as some table pounding and gauntlet tossing -- room was found in a single building for AOL-Time Warner headquarters and a suite of CNN studios; Jazz at Lincoln Center, including a theater with a seating capacity of 1,300 and a performance atrium; 543,000 square feet of retail space (almost as much as in Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship store); a 249-room, five-star Mandarin Oriental Hotel; 203 condominium apartments; and 548 parking spaces. It is to be finished in 2003.</p>
        <p>Each element had not only its own needs but also its own architect: Rafael Vinoly for Jazz at Lincoln Center, Elkus/Manfredi for the retail space, Brennan Beer Gorman for the hotel, HLW International for AOL-Time Warner.</p>
        <p>One of the developers, Kenneth A. Himmel, who is president and chief executive of the Palladium Company, is managing the $1.7 billion Columbus Center project with Stephen M. Ross, chairman and chief executive of Related Companies. The other developer is William L. Mack, co-founder and senior partner of Apollo Real Estate Advisors.</p>
        <p>They make up the second group in 15 years to try to claim the prize of developing the extraordinarily visible 3.4-acre site at the confluence of Central Park, Midtown, Clinton and the Upper West Side; a void along Broadway between the theater district and Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde of Boston Properties were the first. With the financial concern of Salomon Brothers as their major tenant and co-developer, they proposed a 2.7 million-square-foot building designed by Moshe Safdie &amp; Associates as a bundle of angled shafts rising 925 feet.</p>
        <p>Among the opponents was Joseph B. Rose, now the chairman of the City Planning Commission, then the chairman of Community Board 5 in mid-Manhattan. At the time, he assailed the ''striking numbness to any aesthetic criteria whatsoever'' in the choice of the Boston Properties plan.</p>
        <p>Protesters with black umbrellas captured the public imagination in 1987 by tracing the shadow they said the building would cast across Central Park. Later that year, Salomon withdrew from the project just before opponents won a court case that challenged the zoning benefit given to Boston Properties.</p>
        <p>With that, Mr. Zuckerman turned to Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. ''People hated the Safdie scheme,'' Mr. Childs recalled. ''It was so alien. I was trying to find ways to make it fit in.'' In 1988, Boston Properties offered a plan that was derived from 1930's Central Park West towers.</p>
        <p>By 1989, the bottom had dropped out of the real estate market. Five years later, Boston Properties dropped out of the project.</p>
        <p>In 1996, the Giuliani administration and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owned the site, issued a new request for development proposals. Mr. Ross and his partners offered an apartment and hotel project designed by Mr. Childs. In overall shape, though not in architectural detailing, it was similar to the earlier Boston Properties design.</p>
        <p>The development guidelines limited the towers to 750 feet and the size of the project to 2.1 million square feet.</p>
        <p>(The approved project will actually have 2,768,700 square feet of space -- almost as much as the former Pan Am Building at 200 Park Avenue -- but 668,700 square feet are not counted for zoning purposes because the space is underground or used for mechanical equipment. That calculation does not convince Olive Freud of the Committee for Environmentally Sound Development, a neighborhood group that has long opposed Columbus Center. She regards it as an unauthorized increase of 30 percent in the project size.)</p>
        <p>Two things happened in 1997 that profoundly affected the design. Mr. Ross and Mr. Himmel persuaded Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner, to join the project. And Mayor Giuliani insisted that the Columbus Circle development include a performing arts center, perhaps for opera. ''I felt we could extend Lincoln Center by doing that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It turned out that the constituent most in need of a permanent home was Jazz at Lincoln Center. ''Until you have a physical presence,'' said Rob Gibson, its executive producer and director, ''you're not connected to the industry of the city. Or the public.''</p>
        <p>The developers have agreed to set aside 100,000 square feet of space and build the basic structural shell for Jazz at Lincoln Center, which will complete and maintain the space.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the Columbus Center partners were chosen as the new developers. That was when the hard work of accommodating all the diverse occupants began.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most important change in layout was the skewing of the towers, which were originally aligned in such a way that occupants on the north side of the 58th Street building would have a view of another building only 65 feet away. Ditto for occupants on the south side of the 60th Street tower.</p>
        <p>There began a series of revisions and compromises resulting in designs that pleased no one. ''You looked at it and your heart sank,'' recalled Mr. Rose. ''I said: 'We did not go through this whole process to end up with a building designed by committee. We want something here the city can be proud of, an iconic building, not a series of unsuccessful compromises.' ''</p>
        <p>But didn't the administration itself create just such a committee?</p>
        <p>No, he said. The purpose of the panel was not to fine-tune but to point the developers in a direction that would be acceptable to Mr. Giuliani. Besides Mr. Rose, the panel includes John S. Dyson, a former deputy mayor; Jack L. Goldstein, executive director of the Theater Development Fund; Andrew Heiskell, chairman emeritus of the New York Public Library; and Jaquelin T. Robertson of the architectural firm Cooper, Robertson &amp; Partners. ''When the architects came back treating the feedback as if it were 'tweak this and tweak that,' the response was fairly brutal,'' Mr. Rose said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Childs, too, was reaching the end of his patience. ''I'm pretty good at compromise,'' he said. ''But at a certain point, I said: 'I've let this go too far. We'll get the building done but frankly, I don't want to have my name on it.' Thank God, it went over. Everyone agreed. Everyone realized that it had gone too far overboard.''</p>
        <p>Understandably, the developers did not take quite so bleak a view, although they acknowledged the camel-like aspects of the interim version. ''Nobody was happy, but we were prepared to accept it,'' Mr. Ross said. ''Time was marching on. We had already ordered the steel. It was pretty scary. There had to be a lot of faith on both parts -- but more from us than them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Childs and his partners T. J. Gottesdiener and Mustafa K. Abadan made one more try. ''When this orthogonal geometry slid into the modern shape of a parallelogram, its expression couldn't be in square brick any longer,'' Mr. Childs said. ''It's now in ice, sliced ice. Glass.''</p>
        <p>The response from officials was enthusiastic, but one expanse of glass in the new design became a source of contention. The 600-seat performance space of Jazz at Lincoln Center, which once was to overlook Columbus Circle, will now be recessed 20 feet behind a larger glass wall framing the central atrium.</p>
        <p>''The issue of presence and visibility is critical,'' said Mr. Vinoly, the architect for Jazz at Lincoln Center.  Mr. Rose, the planning chairman, said the jazz space would be a ''major presence'' in the project. ''It's the best design yet,'' he said. ''The building captures its place in the city, in the urban context. David Childs rose to the occasion. There were some raised voices involved, but it was to good effect.</p>
        <p>''This is not a place for a bad building.''</p>
