        <p>Timing, in constitutional law no less than in life or love, can mean everything, and when it came to timing, the opponents of the Miranda decision who finally managed to push the Supreme Court into revisiting the case after 34 years turned out to have been spectacularly unlucky.</p>
        <p>There might well have been a period, sometime in the last three decades, when the court would have overturned Miranda, a bitterly fought 5-to-4 decision that had appeared ever since to have an ever more fragile hold on the court's loyalties.</p>
        <p>But it was the bad fortune of opponents finally to get the justices' attention at the very moment when the court's interest in protecting its constitutional turf against Congressional incursions was at a peak unmatched in recent years.</p>
        <p>At issue in the case decided on Monday was a 1968 law by which Congress sought to overturn Miranda by replacing the familiar warnings with the case-by-case test of a confession's ''voluntariness'' that the Miranda decision found constitutionally inadequate.</p>
        <p>The notion that Congress would tell the court what the Constitution does or does not mean undoubtedly would have offended the court when the law was passed. By this year, when the court got its first chance to rule on the law, the idea was anathema, and a much more conservative group of justices than the members of the Warren Court who had struggled over the confession issue 34 years ago struck down the law and reaffirmed Miranda by a 7-to-2 vote.</p>
        <p>In a real sense, the surprisingly lopsided decision this week said more about the court itself than about Miranda or about defendants' rights in general.</p>
        <p>''It's power, pure power,'' said Leon Friedman, a constitutional law professor at Hofstra Law School. ''The court is telling Congress: 'You can't overturn our good decisions, and you can't overturn our bad decisions. You can't overturn our decisions -- period.' ''</p>
        <p>One precedent Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist cited in his opinion was telling: City of Boerne v. Flores, the 1997 decision that overturned the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Congress had passed that law in 1993 to give more official protection to religious practice than the court had said, in a decision three years earlier, the First Amendment's free exercise clause provided for. ''The power to interpret the Constitution in a case or controversy remains in the judiciary,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court in the Boerne case.</p>
        <p>In that instance, Congress was being more protective of individual rights than the court, while in the anti-Miranda statute, known as Section 3501, it was less protective. The outcome was the same. ''Congress may not legislatively supersede our decisions interpreting and applying the Constitution,'' Chief Justice Rehnquist said on Monday in the Miranda case, United States v. Dickerson.</p>
        <p>Barely a month earlier, in his opinion for the court striking down the civil damages provision of the Violence Against Women Act on the ground that Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority, Chief Justice Rehnquist reached back to Chief Justice John Marshall's declaration in Marbury v. Madison in 1803 for the ultimate statement of judicial supremacy: ''It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.''</p>
        <p>Even in the context of the other recent cases, however, Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion for the court on Monday was notable because it placed him so strikingly against type. He joined the court six years after Miranda was decided and even as a very junior associate justice quickly became one of the decision's most outspoken critics.</p>
        <p>He has never been known for changing his mind, and there is no reason to think that he has changed his basic view of the decision. What quite clearly gave him pause was not some newfound affection for Miranda, but the possible consequences to the court of overturning it at this point, after dozens of decisions had applied Miranda to state-court convictions and to state prisoners' federal petitions for habeas corpus.</p>
        <p>As the chief justice noted in his opinion, the only possible source of the court's authority to apply Miranda came from the decision's status as a direct interpretation of the Constitution. To decide now that Congress had legislatively overruled Miranda 32 years ago -- a colossal ''never mind'' -- would have made the court look ineffectual if not fatuous. A close student of the court's history, on which he has published three well-received books, Chief Justice Rehnquist may well have been dismayed by the prospect that a decision to overturn Miranda might go down in the public mind as the main legacy of his tenure as chief justice.</p>
        <p>The 75-year-old chief justice may not be as preoccupied with his legacy as President Clinton is with his; unlike the president, the chief justice faces no timetable for leaving office and, for all anyone knows, may have no retirement plans. Still, having served on the court since the age of 47, for the last 14 years as chief justice, it would hardly be surprising if he had another, more affirmative sort of legacy in mind.</p>
        <p>And in fact, his mark on the court is substantial. He is the prime mover behind the federalism revolution, the court's dramatically revived interest in policing the exercise of Congressional power as well as the boundary between state and federal authority.</p>
        <p>Since 1995, when the court ruled in United States v. Lopez, in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, that Congress had exceeded its authority in making it a federal crime to carry a gun near a school, the court has invalidated all or part of 25 federal laws, many on federalism or separation of powers grounds. When Miranda's opponents set Section 3501 years ago on its circuitous journey to the court, they should have expected heavy waters but can be excused for not having anticipated the shoals on which the statute foundered and ultimately sank.</p>
