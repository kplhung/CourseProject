        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Schools Turning From Teaching Trades'' (front page, June 21) did not mention the trend of school-to-work partnerships between businesses and schools. One study predicts that by the year 2005, only 21 percent of the jobs generated in this country will require a college degree. School-to-work partnerships play a vital role in matching skills with job requirements.</p>

        <p>''Schools Turning From Teaching Trades'' (front page, June 21) did not mention the trend of school-to-work partnerships between businesses and schools. One study predicts that by the year 2005, only 21 percent of the jobs generated in this country will require a college degree. School-to-work partnerships play a vital role in matching skills with job requirements.</p>
        <p>One example is the nationwide Automotive Youth Education Systems program, co-sponsored by automakers and dealerships. Students carry a full academic workload and are guaranteed a job at the local dealership upon completing the program -- a strong incentive to finish school. There are 175 schools and 1,660 dealerships in 31 states now taking part.</p>
        <p>This kind of training is compatible with a solid academic education and is essential to meeting the nation's needs.</p>
