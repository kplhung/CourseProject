        <p>NEWS</p>
        <p>Fanfare  With ''Bach and Beyond: Music for the New  Millennium'' as its theme, the 13th season of the Vail Valley Music Festival in Colorado begins at 6 tonight when Marin Alsop leads  the Colorado Symphony in works by Copland, Chopin, Bach and Beethoven. The pianist Garrick Ohlsson is the soloist in Chopin's Concerto No. 1 in E minor. Others to appear before the festival ends on Aug. 6 include the violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, the pianist Christopher O'Riley and the soprano Sylvia McNair.</p>
        <p>Conjuring  ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.'' Long kept secret, that is the title of the fourth of the immensely popular J. K. Rowling ''Harry Potter'' novels, which is to be published on July 8 in the United States by Scholastic with a first printing of 3.8 million copies. The 752-page book, priced at $25.95, will go on sale in some stores at midnight.</p>
        <p>Now Hear This  Most museum exhibitions are designed for the eye, but the one that opens on Sunday for a run through September at the P.S.  1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City is described as the institution's least visual show. It is ''Volume: Bed of Sound.'' The show includes everything from sound effects by Walter Murch from ''Apocalypse Now!'' to world premiere pieces by Laurie Anderson and Ryuichi Sakomoto.</p>
        <p>Beholding Life  Ralph Fasanella once said: ''The most important thing is to paint your identity.'' He also said: ''New York sends me up. The city sings and I want to sing with it.'' Fasanella, who grew up in Greenwich Village and lived in Ardsley in Westchester County for more than 30 years, dropped out of school at 14 and worked as a gas station attendant, truck driver, machinist and labor organizer. In bright colors and meticulous detail, he painted what he knew: stickball games, street festivals, service stations and train stations. From Friday until Sept. 10, some 25 of his paintings, assembled from the private collection of his family and celebrating the urban working class, immigrant life and the American dream, will be on display in ''Fun City: Celebrating the Life of Ralph Fasanella'' at the Hudson River Museum, 511 Warburton Avenue, Yonkers.</p>
