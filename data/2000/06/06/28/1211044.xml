        <p>I very much appreciated the article about scallops (''Sweet Bounty Returns: Sea Scallops,'' June 21) and will be sure to refer to them in the future as day boat scallops or diver scallops (much as I've learned to assure my guests that they're eating the famed -- and totally mythical -- peekytoe crabs).</p>

        <p>I very much appreciated the article about scallops (''Sweet Bounty Returns: Sea Scallops,'' June 21) and will be sure to refer to them in the future as day boat scallops or diver scallops (much as I've learned to assure my guests that they're eating the famed -- and totally mythical -- peekytoe crabs).</p>
        <p>But when we served scallops to a marine biologist visiting from Edinburgh, all he wanted to know was what happened to the roe attached to the adductor, the only part of the scallop we in America eat. Throughout Europe, scallops are sold and served entire.</p>
        <p>I'm not quite sure why ours are de-sexed but suspect it has more to do with red tide than with Puritan sensibilities. In any event, I wish we could get what our guest referred to as ''the good part.''</p>
