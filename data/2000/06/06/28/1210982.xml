        <p>Media Metrix Inc., an influential arbiter of who's hot and who's not in the Internet world, will acquire Jupiter Communications, a leading analyst of Internet trends, the two companies said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Combining the two companies will create ''the definitive source for Internet measurement and analysis,'' said Tod Johnson, chairman and chief executive of Media Metrix, which calculates the popularity of more than 21,000 Web sites based on software tracking the habits of 70,000 computer users in the United States and overseas.</p>
        <p>Both Media Metrix and Jupiter are seen as industry leaders in providing valuable insights into trends however questionable the actual figures on which they are based.</p>
        <p>''Media Metrix's monthly reports definitely move stocks,'' said Henry Blodgett, who tracks a broad portfolio of Internet companies for Merrill Lynch. ''It's the closest thing there is to a standard.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson said that the merger should help the two companies expand overseas where demand for Internet information is growing rapidly. It is also intended to provide opportunities for ''hybrid'' products, including analytical commentaries on Media Metrix data and databases that help Jupiter produce analysis of more narrowly defined market segments.</p>
        <p>Media Metrix's largest competitor is Nielsen/NetRatings (an alliance of Nielsen Media Research and NetRatings Inc.). Jupiter, which gets most of its revenue from subscribers to monthly research reports and seminars, competes most directly with Forrester Research, based in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
        <p>Investors were not immediately impressed by the possibilities of Jupiter Media Metrix. Shares of Media Metrix fell $4.875, or 17 percent, to $23.375, while Jupiter's dipped $1.937, or 8 percent, to $21.625. Under the terms of the agreement, Jupiter shareholders will receive 0.946 share of Media Metrix stock for each of their shares. The stock swap, which was valued at about $414 million when the deal was announced, was worth $343 million by the end of trading.</p>
