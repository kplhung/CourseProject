        <p>Go.com, Walt Disney's Internet unit, agreed yesterday to sell Ultraseek, its corporate networking subsidiary, to the Inktomi Corporation for $344.7 million in cash and stock. The move to sell Ultraseek, which provides customizable search and navigation software to businesses, is part of Go.com's efforts to focus on consumers. The company, based in North Hollywood, Calif., acquired Ultraseek as part of its deal to buy Infoseek last year. Inktomi, based in Foster City, Calif., will pay $3.5 million in cash, and stock valued at $341.2 million. Inktomi's shares fell $2.9375, to $125.875, while Go.com rose 18.75 cents, to $12.50.</p>
