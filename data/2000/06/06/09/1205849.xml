        <p>With flying knives, jagged bottles, snipping scissors and a chomping chopper, Penn &amp; Teller are back on Broadway with a sharp show.</p>
        <p>It's not just that they are making mischief with the blindfolded young woman from the audience who is asked to hurl knives at the inviting target that is the 6-foot-6-inch, 274-pound Penn Jillette. Or that flaming torches aren't enough for him; he has to juggle empty liquor bottles whose bottoms he has shattered. Or that the sawed-off, silent Teller seems to have an accident with a little white bunny and that voracious chopper.</p>

        <p>With flying knives, jagged bottles, snipping scissors and a chomping chopper, Penn &amp; Teller are back on Broadway with a sharp show.</p>
        <p>It's not just that they are making mischief with the blindfolded young woman from the audience who is asked to hurl knives at the inviting target that is the 6-foot-6-inch, 274-pound Penn Jillette. Or that flaming torches aren't enough for him; he has to juggle empty liquor bottles whose bottoms he has shattered. Or that the sawed-off, silent Teller seems to have an accident with a little white bunny and that voracious chopper.</p>
        <p>And never mind the crimson streak Teller leaves after he has used a pair of gleaming scissors to snip the leaves off the shadow of a flower and leaves in a vase, even as the petals of that same flower and those leaves simultaneously fall to the floor. And what about the sheet that mysteriously floods with blood  after Mr. Jillette delivers a lecture on medical trauma?</p>
        <p>Call them tricksters, conjurers, prestidigitators, illusionists or masters of legerdemain. To their credit,  Penn &amp; Teller have more on their inventive minds than unadulterated entertainment in this intelligent, highly diverting show, which runs through Sunday at the Beacon Theater. In the midst of all the tricks and patter, here's the place to find a discussion of First Amendment issues like flag burning or shouting ''Fire!'' in a crowded theater.</p>
        <p>So, while dazzling the eye and tickling the funny bone, Penn &amp; Teller make clear that magic resides, too, in stimulating the mind with words and ideas. Time spent in their company is both entertaining and eloquent.</p>
        <p>As always, Penn delights in explaining the magician's bag of tricks -- skills like palming, misdirection and switching -- and then, with Teller as his accomplished accomplice, in proceeding to fool the audience anyway. An egg turns into a lemon; a cut cloth becomes whole. A playing card tossed into that chopper emerges intact, and its missing portion is filled by the piece held by the audience member who tore it off.</p>
        <p>And in a tribute to Houdini, Teller is tied and stapled into a chair by two audience members and put behind a curtain where bells beyond his reach ring and a face appears. When the curtain is opened, Teller is no longer wearing his jacket, though the volunteers attest to the fact that he remains tied and stapled to the chair. And when the mischief ends, the volunteers again swear that nothing has changed, whereupon Teller simply stands up and walks free.</p>
        <p>Teller also gives a hand shadow performance of Shel Silverstein's ''Unicorn,'' using as a prop the ladder on which Penn has been standing straitjacketed with his head in a noose.</p>
        <p>But never fear.</p>
        <p>Mofo the psychic gorilla, who also figures in their act, could have predicted that with Penn &amp; Teller, it's all in the best of good fun.</p>
        <p>PENN &amp; TELLER</p>
        <p>Music by Gary Stockdale; production manager, Kathleen (Burt) Bramlett; stage manager, Robert P. Libbon; sound engineer, Rex Harris; assistant to Penn &amp; Teller, Glenn Shecky Alai. At the Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 75th Street.</p>
        <p>WITH: Penn Jillette and Teller.</p>
