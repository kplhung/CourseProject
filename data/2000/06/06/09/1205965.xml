        <p>Wasting no time, Microsoft filed a court plea overnight, asking for an immediate stay of the ruling a federal judge entered against the company on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The company offered expansive reasoning for the request, saying the judgment would ''inflict grievous and irreparable harm on Microsoft, its 35,000 employees, its millions of shareholders, its thousands of business partners and tens of millions of consumers around the world who rely on Microsoft's products.''</p>
        <p>As a matter of legal routine, the appeal went to Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson -- the same judge who ruled against Microsoft. He can be expected to deny the motion, an action required before Microsoft can take the case to a Court of Appeals.</p>
        <p>Joel I. Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said during a news briefing today that Judge Jackson's order included ''straightforward remedies, things like Microsoft not being able to intimidate computer manufacturers who choose to select other people's products, things like not illegally tying two products together as a way to force them on consumers, things that are really I think rather basic and fundamental.''</p>
        <p>William Neukom, Microsoft's chief counsel, offered a different view. During a news conference on Wednesday night at the corporate headquarters in Redmond, Wash., he repeated the company's complaint that the remedy would require Microsoft to ''disclose our most valuable intellectual property, even to our competitors'' and ''that we would be required to redesign all of our operating-systems software products to the government's vague and ambiguous specifications.''</p>
        <p>Even with the continuing harsh language, both Mr. Klein and Mr. Neukom, in response to questions, said they would still be willing to settle the case. A civil case can be settled at any point, even if it is before the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>''The department is prepared to engage in meaningful settlement negotiations,'' Mr. Klein said, adding that any settlement must ''meaningfully address the harm that's occurred to this market and ensure on a going-forward basis that it not be replicated.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Neukom's theoretical endorsement of settlement discussions was tepid as well. ''I don't think we ever have or would close the door to good-faith negotiations to resolve differences,'' he said. ''We do that every day in the law department here at Microsoft. We've settled more cases than we've had to try or appeal, and that's good management and we'll continue to do that.''</p>
        <p>No movement has been made to start settlement talks, and none is expected. Judge Jackson, in a recent interview with The New York Times, said he thought Microsoft had ''probably flexed as far as they were going to'' during the four-month settlement talks that ended on April 1. At the end of those talks, the two sides remained far apart.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein announced on Wednesday evening that the Justice Department would seek to route Microsoft's appeal directly to the Supreme Court, under a 1974 revision of federal antitrust laws that allows direct appeals in cases of national significance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Neukom responded that Microsoft would oppose such an effort to ''try to circumvent an appeal to the Court of Appeals,'' where the company believes it will receive more favorable treatment. He also suggested that the Supreme Court might not accept the case because it had agreed only once before to take an expedited appeal of an antitrust case, during the suit against AT&amp;T in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein acknowledged that expedited appeals were rare. But he also said that since 1974, AT&amp;T's was the only antitrust case of true national significance that had been in the federal courts. ''So the paucity of precedent, I think, actually reinforces the government's view that the act was designed precisely for this kind of case,'' Mr. Klein said.</p>
