        <p>Issuing the first verdict in a case that outraged the public and prompted a swift strengthening of Connecticut's witness protection laws, a jury today convicted a drug dealer of ordering the murder of an 8-year-old boy last year to prevent the child from testifying against him as the state's key witness in another murder trial.</p>
        <p>The jury in State Supreme Court here convicted the dealer, Russell  Peeler Jr., of also ordering the slaying of the boy's mother, Karen Clarke; she and the boy, Leroy Brown Jr., were shot to death in their Bridgeport apartment on Jan. 7, 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peeler, 28, a convicted drug dealer who is already serving a 105-year prison sentence for killing Ms. Clarke's longtime boyfriend, may now get the death penalty.</p>
        <p>The penalty phase of the trial is scheduled to start on Tuesday and prosecutors will try to persuade the jury of five men and seven women that Mr. Peeler should be sentenced to death.</p>
        <p>The boy, known as B. J., was going to be the main prosecution witness in the killing of Ms. Clarke's fiance, Rudolph Snead Jr., whom B. J. called Dad. In 1997, at age 7, B. J. was an eyewitness when Mr. Peeler first tried to kill Mr. Snead. Mr. Peeler, charged with attempted murder, was out on bail when he did shoot Mr. Snead to death in a barbershop nine months later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peeler was also free on bail when B. J. and his mother were killed, but an electronic ankle bracelet that he was wearing by court order to track his movements made clear that he could not have been the gunman. That role, prosecutors have charged, was played by Mr. Peeler's younger brother, Adrian, 23, who is being tried separately for the killings.</p>
        <p>The brazen murders of B. J. and his mother prompted a tremendous outcry from the public and officials, who said that the state had clearly failed to protect its young witness. In response, state legislators and law enforcement officials drafted a bill that created one of the most comprehensive state witness protection programs in the country.</p>
        <p>The law was signed by Gov. John G. Rowland in July 1999 and took effect in October. It gave the chief state's attorney direct responsibility for protecting witnesses through a new witness protection unit, made it a felony to intimidate a witness, and gave judges broad authority to issue witness protection orders.</p>
        <p>The law also directed the office of the state's attorney to ''give special consideration to a witness who is a child, elderly or handicapped or otherwise more at risk of being intimidated,'' and it gave prosecutors the authority to take custody of a child witness if parents did not provide adequate protection.</p>
        <p>In a trial that lasted more than a month, the jury in State Supreme Court heard from more than 50 prosecution witnesses, including Russell Peeler's girlfriend, Angelina Keene, the mother of his three children, who testified that a month before the killings Mr. Peeler had told her that he was going to start killing witnesses. Another witness, Kybarris Taylor, testified that Mr. Peeler had offered him $10,000 to kill ''two nobodies.''</p>
        <p>Among the most provocative evidence was testimony from Josephine Lee, who lived across the street from B. J. and his mother. Ms. Lee, who pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge, said she had helped the Peeler brothers carry out the killings by getting Ms. Clarke to open her door. Defense lawyers showed the jurors several letters they had obtained in which Ms. Lee contradicted her testimony about the Peelers' involvement in the killings.</p>
        <p>Shortly after noon today, the jury announced that it had reached a verdict. Judge G. Sarsfield Ford warned spectators not to react vocally to the verdict and none did. One of Mr. Peeler's lawyers, John T. Walkley, said the conviction would be appealed on numerous grounds. ''I thought that the evidence was not there to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,'' Mr. Walkley said.</p>
