        <p>Shahzia Sikander has received much attention in the past few years. In Pakistan, where she was born, she learned the arduous techniques of Indian miniature painting. After coming to the United States she infused old models with new content to suggest tensions between Islam and Hinduism and India and the West, and the conflicted relationship of women to all of these. The pictures she produced were vivid and complex, and Ms. Sikander successfully expanded their themes into wall paintings.</p>
        <p>Wall painting is the primary format in her Whitney show, organized by Debra Singer, and the images are intriguing: goddesses in sneakers, wheels formed from cowboy boots (the artist lives part time in Texas), high-color vegetation adapted from Rajput miniatures. But there are problems.</p>

        <p>Shahzia Sikander has received much attention in the past few years. In Pakistan, where she was born, she learned the arduous techniques of Indian miniature painting. After coming to the United States she infused old models with new content to suggest tensions between Islam and Hinduism and India and the West, and the conflicted relationship of women to all of these. The pictures she produced were vivid and complex, and Ms. Sikander successfully expanded their themes into wall paintings.</p>
        <p>Wall painting is the primary format in her Whitney show, organized by Debra Singer, and the images are intriguing: goddesses in sneakers, wheels formed from cowboy boots (the artist lives part time in Texas), high-color vegetation adapted from Rajput miniatures. But there are problems.</p>
        <p>In the past, Ms. Sikander has successfully layered such forms through pinpoint-fine draftsmanship and skillfully modulated paint so that different details gradually emerged. At the Whitney, she seems to be trying for a comparable effect by painting both directly on the wall and on suspended strips of opaque paper, but the technique in this case doesn't work. The results look unresolved, even unfinished, obscurant rather than revealing.</p>
        <p>More successful are three large paintings hung high in the nearby atrium. They have the delicacy and density we have come to expect from Ms. Sikander's work and are the best things in what is, perhaps, a transitional show for a gifted artist trying to move beyond the miniaturist label.</p>
