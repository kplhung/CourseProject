        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Rescue Me, Please!'', by Maureen Dowd (column, June 7):</p>
        <p>Women bring a different perspective to the world of work. They do not necessarily value working for a corporation over taking care of themselves, their relationships and their enjoyment of life.</p>
        <p>However, all workers are called upon to make these sacrifices. How many men, if surveyed, would prefer not to work if they had the option? Probably quite a few. The popular dream of making enough money in a dot-com to retire by age 35 is evidence.</p>
        <p>It would be desirable to reshape our work so as to sacrifice less of what is important to us about life. Work as we know it is hardly pleasant for anybody. Women's resistance to it is not retro; it is forward-thinking.</p>
