        <p>The classic sole-practitioner doctor's office, usually on the ground floor of a stately building, marked by a discreet plaque, has been acquiring a new use in recent years. Reflecting changes both in the medical world and the rising real estate market, many are being converted into apartments.</p>
        <p>With increasing numbers of doctors joining group practices that require large spaces and the newest technology, and with doctors retiring at younger ages, in part due to the pressures of managed care, some say the elegant, old-world office is becoming obsolete.</p>
        <p>At the same time, with residential brokers lamenting the shortage of apartments for sale or rent, even ground-floor spaces, subject to street noise and limited light, have become attractive to apartment buyers.</p>
        <p>''With managed health care, fewer doctors want these spaces and with the tremendous lack of inventory, there is a greater demand for residential space, and this can help fill that demand,'' said Hall Willkie, executive vice president and director of sales for Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
        <p>Adding to the appeal of the ground-floor offices is that they tend to be most prevalent on Fifth and Park Avenues and are, relatively speaking, a bargain in today's overheated market.</p>
        <p>''We're certainly starting to see a trend of individuals looking for residential apartments on upper floors now beginning to look at the alternative of purchasing these spaces to convert into residences,'' said Paul Wexler, president of Corcoran Wexler Health Care Properties, which specializes in health-care-related real estate transactions.</p>
        <p>''This fills a void for the individual who wants to buy a 2,000-square-foot apartment upstairs but doesn't necessarily have the $2 million purchase price. For 50 to 60 percent of that, you can buy on the ground floor.''</p>
        <p>However, though the ground-floor unit may be the same size as one on a higher floor, there are drawbacks. Offices in buildings that predate the 1950's are likely to have been former apartments, but in many cases their once-spacious rooms have been carved into cubicles to fit medical needs.</p>
        <p>And no matter how well the premises were maintained, ''All those walls have to be knocked out,'' Mr. Willkie said. ''The bathrooms may be old and yucky and you have to put in a kitchen. Even those spaces that were residential and were left pretty much intact still need a lot of work.''</p>
        <p>And since offices in buildings from the 1960's, 1970's and later were designed as professional suites, they do not even have the basic structure for an apartment.</p>
        <p>Adding to the expense in co-op buildings, where monthly charges are calculated by the number of shares in the co-op corporation assigned to each unit, Mr. Willkie said, is that, ''Frequently when shares were established, greater numbers of them were allocated to the professional space, so the maintenance is often higher than it is for comparable space on higher floors.''</p>
        <p>Co-op boards have increasingly encouraged the conversion of doctors' offices to cut down on the traffic generated by patients, brokers say, especially where the doctor's entrance is through the lobby.</p>
        <p>But prospective buyers must get the approval of co-op boards just as they would were they purchasing apartments, and sometimes that can pose unexpected hurdles.</p>
        <p>Dr. David R. Coddon, director of the headache clinic at the Mount Sinai Medical Center and an associate professor of neurology, put his 11-room, 2,540-square-foot office on Fifth Avenue and 84th Street on the market in 1996, when, he said, ''I began to see for the first time that my overhead was more than my income.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''It is a maisonette with its own entrance, and Mike Nichols, who lives in the building, wanted to buy it. Everything was completed for the sale, but at the last minute the board wouldn't approve. I have no idea why.''</p>
        <p>Last year, he finally sold it for $1,215,000 (''On an upper floor, it would have been $4 million,'' he said) to a woman moving from the San Remo on the West Side, who, he said, seems to still be in the process of renovation.</p>
        <p>Financial considerations aside, there are pros and cons to living in a former medical office.</p>
        <p>''You have to realize when you are on the ground floor, you get a lot of what goes on on the street outside,'' Mr. Wexler said. ''I've had people who wanted to buy and then noticed that the garbage kept appearing outside the window and realized that the unit was right where the garbage is put out. For a doctor who leaves after hours that doesn't matter, but if you are living there, you don't want to come home to 62 bags of garbage.''</p>
        <p>Hope Dana, an architect, and her husband, John Perkins, an investment banker, were not necessarily looking for a doctor's office when they decided to move from Greenwich, Conn., two years ago, but they did tell their broker, Elizabeth Celano, who is with William B. May, that they wanted ''a wreck.''</p>
        <p>''We figured we would get better value and would be able to make it our own,'' Ms. Dana said. What they found was a ground-floor doctor's office in a 98-year-old building in Brooklyn Heights that had been vacant for 15 years. A previous owner had bought it intending to convert it into a residence and then abandoned it. ''It was in horrible shape, there was no kitchen, but there was a sink in every room,'' Ms. Dana said. ''We demolished everything, put in a living-dining room, eat-in kitchen, laundry room, three bedrooms and two bathrooms.''</p>
        <p>The biggest challenge was persuading the co-op board to grant permission to install central air-conditioning. ''We had 7-by-5-feet casement windows that open out which we would have had to cut and rebuild to put in individual units,'' Ms. Dana said.</p>
        <p>She would not discuss what they had paid for the space, ''but it was so cheap that we were fine,'' she said, adding: ''Now we have a three-bedroom apartment that is probably worth double what we put into it. It was a way for us to move into New York City and get a beautiful place.''</p>
