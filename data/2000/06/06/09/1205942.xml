        <p>Editorial applauds New York State Senate for finally approving legislation that would increase penalties for hate crimes; says there should be little difficulty in reaching a compromise with similar bill passed by Assembly in February</p>

        <p>It has been a source of shame that year after year New York State has failed to enact a meaningful hate-crime law even as violence against gays and minority groups has become more common. More than 40 other states have approved some form of hate-crime legislation.</p>
        <p>This week the State Senate finally approved a bill that will increase punishments for those convicted of crimes motivated by hatred. These lawmakers are sending an important message that such crimes harm entire communities as well as individual victims, and therefore deserve greater punishment. The Senate bill would increase sentences for crimes in which the victims are singled out because of their race, gender, religion, national origin, age, disability or sexual orientation.</p>

        <p>This week the State Senate finally approved a bill that will increase punishments for those convicted of crimes motivated by hatred. These lawmakers are sending an important message that such crimes harm entire communities as well as individual victims, and therefore deserve greater punishment. The Senate bill would increase sentences for crimes in which the victims are singled out because of their race, gender, religion, national origin, age, disability or sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>For more than a decade the Republican Senate has blocked such legislation. Gov. George Pataki has been supportive of tougher penalties for bias-related crimes and has offered his own program in recent years. But Senate Republicans have consistently refused to include sexual orientation in any bill, even though crimes against gays are a fast-growing segment of bias crimes. This year Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, perhaps sensitive to election-year pressures, allowed the governor's bill to be put to a floor vote. The bill passed by a vote of 48 to 12.</p>
        <p>The Assembly, which has approved hate-crime legislation for the past 11 years, passed a similar bill in February. Though the two bills are different in procedure, they both significantly increase criminal penalties. There should be little difficulty in reaching a compromise for the governor to sign. It is time New York took a strong step against violence directed toward specific groups.</p>
