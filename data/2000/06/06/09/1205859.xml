        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* ART ENSEMBLE OF CHICAGO, Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 343-8805. This performance is dedicated to Lester Bowie, the band's trumpeter through three and a half decades, who died late last year. It's hard to picture the band, now down to a woodwinds-bass-drums trio, without Bowie's comic presence, which always balanced out the saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell's formalism. But the band's deep following among the kind of audience that built the Knitting Factory ought to ensure that the  evening will at the very least have a poignancy. Performances are Sunday night at 8 and 10; tickets are $35 in advance and $40 the day of the show (Ben Ratliff).</p>

        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* ART ENSEMBLE OF CHICAGO, Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 343-8805.

Performances are Sunday night at 8 and 10; tickets are $35 in advance and $40 the day of the show (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>''AS LONG AS YOU'RE LIVING YOURS'': THE MUSIC OF KEITH JARRETT, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. This gig, timed to an RCA release of the same name, isn't a bad idea: Mr. Jarrett's impressionistic written music gets short shrift in deference to his stature as a soloist who makes his own music intimidatingly personal. The septet playing his compositions includes the saxophonists George Garzone and Jimmy Greene, and the drummer Billy Kilson, one of the sparks of Dave Holland's great new band. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a $25 cover; Sunday night sets are at 7 and 9, with an $18 cover. There is a $10 minimum for all sets (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>KENNY BARRON, Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, 58 Seventh Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 622-3300. Mr. Barron is one of the great figures in the postwar history of jazz piano playing, a refiner and fuser of bebop, blues, and the uncategorizable art of Thelonious Monk. The solo-piano performances are tomorrow night at 7 and 9; admission is $20 for each set; $15 for students and the elderly (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>JANE BUNNETT AND HAVANA SPIRIT, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 242-1785. Ms. Bunnett, a soprano saxophonist, has been traveling to Cuba through the last decade, intensively researching the music and organizing recording sessions; her latest, ''Ritmo and Soul'' (Blue Note/EMI) brings African percussionists and singers into the group, making sense of the forces of history that brought Yoruban culture and religious music to Cuba. She's an energetic, commanding saxophonist who brings all her energy to these performances. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $20 plus $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* JAMES CARTER ELECTRIC PROJECT/RUSSELL MALONE QUARTET, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. There are guitars in both bands, but the similarities might end there. Mr. Carter earned his name by a series of maverick moves: performing with everybody from Wynton Marsalis to Frank Lowe, playing several different kinds of wind instruments and showing an apparent love for the history of the saxophone from the 1930's to, as they say, the future. He's overpowering and sometimes overbearing, but this particular group does him right, setting him loose on the wild, gritty avant-funk music that grew up in New York 20 years ago. Mr. Malone, the guitarist who spent several years in Diana Krall's well-drilled band, is a slightly quieter virtuoso but no less impressive. Sets tonight through Sunday night are at 9 and 11:30; cover charge is $27.50 with a one-drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>PETER CASE, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Peter Case's songwriting inclinations have carried him from the power pop of the Plimsouls to wryly folky songs; he can be a wiseguy, a man in love or a precise observer of the down and out. Sunday night at 7:30, with Shannon Wright and Marie Beer opening. Admission is $10 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>* THE CLIENTELE, Fez, 380 Lafayette at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Sounding like the Leaves in the era of ''Walk Away Renee,'' this languidly psychedelic band from Britain is fast becoming the newest taste sensation among fans of Belle and Sebastian and other high-class retro-pop bands. The Fez is a great place to see the Clientele before the group gets more popular, and the bill, organized by the tasteful folk of Chickfactor, also features the totally charming team of Dudley Klute and L. D. Beghtol, with Tahiti 80 and the Saturday People. A lovely way to spend a balmy night. Tomorrow night at 9:30; admission is $10 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>* MARSHALL CRENSHAW/DAVID OLNEY, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. Marshall Crenshaw's songs seem to roll of the guitar in a casual blend of pre-70's styles -- folk-rock, surf-rock, country and above all the Beatles -- that put melody first. With his winsome tenor he delves into the ways love goes right and  wrong, from distant yearning to the aftermath of infidelity, hiding turmoil within the chiming tunes. David Olney is a Southern kindred spirit to Mr. Crenshaw; he, too, is a Buddy Holly fan, and his weathered voice and foursquare tunes are full of romantic yearning. Tonight at 7:30 and 10:30 admission is $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* ''DEPARTURES AND DESTINATIONS'': JACKIE McLEAN/ANDREW HILL/JASON MORAN, Aaron Davis Hall, West 134th Street and Convent Avenue, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7289. Here's a past-and-present bill that really makes sense. The saxophonist Jackie McLean and the pianist Andrew Hill made their biggest marks on jazz in the 1960's for Blue Note records, splitting the difference between bebop and the outer circles of jazz that were then called the new thing. But what they still have in common is that they produce valuable young disciples. The pianist Jason Moran has learned much from Mr. Hill, and he'll perform with his trio, with the saxophonist Greg Osby dropping in as a guest. Then Mr. McLean and Mr. Hill will perform in a startling ad-hoc band with the vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson and the drummer Billy Higgins.  Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $20 to $25, available from the number above or via Ticketmaster at (212) 307-7171 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* BO DOLLIS AND THE WILD MAGNOLIAS, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. Wearing glittery, towering feathered and beaded costumes, the Wild Magnolias, a Mardi Gras Indian tribe from New Orleans, sing what used to be fight songs: taunts for rival tribes that they'd battle on Mardi Gras day. Now, the costumes and songs have sublimated the street fights, and the drums and tambourines have been supplemented by a funk band, turning battle chants into irresistible party music. Tonight at 8:45 and 11:15; admission is $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>DAVE HALL, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. Dave Hall uses the rhythms of Africa and the Middle East to heighten the emotions expressed in his musical vignettes, chronicling the America he has discovered since his youth spent roaming America before settling in Brooklyn, figuring out where he fits within a world bent on categories he's not keen to fulfill. A gay man who expresses his sexuality as one piece of the puzzle, a folkie with a hankering for rock, Dave Hall takes the same open approach to music-making as he does to his life. Tomorrow night at 7:30 and 10:30; admission is $15 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>* ROY HAYNES TRIO, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-3080. Mr. Haynes, a drummer, has left a trail of excellence behind him, through the early days of Harlem bebop; stints with with Sarah Vaughan, Thelonius Monk John and Coltrane; Chick Corea's earliest music; one of Pat Metheny's best records; and on and on. At 75,  he plays at full strength, making a deep splash in the music whenever he sets up behind a band, always challenging his players. Taking a break from his regular group, he made a record last year with the pianist Danilo Perez and bassist John Pattitucci (''The Roy Haynes Trio'' on Verve/Universal) and it's a neat, muscular retrospective of his work. This is the band's first and perhaps only tour, so see it while it still exists. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30 plus $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>VINCENT HERRING QUINTET, Up Over Jazz Cafe, 351 Flatbush Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 398-5413. Mr. Herring, a dark horse of the tenor saxophone since the 80's, has one of the most forceful, commanding sounds around, and in this band, paired with the equally strong trumpeter Eddie Henderson, he'll be in competitive surroundings. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 10:30, and midnight; there is a $15 cover with a $5 minimum per set (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>KISS, Jones Beach Amphitheater, Meadowbrook Parkway South, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000. Will the Flaming Four really hang up their smoke bombs and platform boots after this Farewell Tour? It's true, the band's major shareholders have other career options: Paul Stanley has proven his talent for Disneyfied Broadway in a Toronto production of ''Phantom of the Opera,'' and Gene Simmons oversees the band's inexhaustible merchandising. (Get your ''Alive IV'' drumheads direct from the source!) Peter Criss and Ace Frehley have been along for the ride since the 1996 reuntion and will fade back into semi-renown as talking heads on VH-1 documentaries. But it's hard to imagine that rock's greatest living comic strip will never again take the stage to the crunching strains of ''Detroit Rock City.'' Doesn't Mr. Simmons need to spit his monthly quota of fake blood? At any rate, Kiss virgins should not miss the chance to witness the band's historic spectacle. If you hate hard rock, skip the frighteningly right-wing opening acts, Ted Nugent and Skid Row, and proceed directly to the circus. The likes of Kiss will not be seen again. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7; tickets for tonight's show are sold out, returns may be available; tickets for tomorrow's show are $35 to $85. (Powers).</p>
        <p>L7, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. The indestructible female warriors of heavy metal continue to spread their gospel of raunch and self-respect to fans around the world, showing that fierce female rock is more than a marketing category. Fourteen years after breaking through with their tough, joyful sound, these women show no signs of becoming tediously ladylike. Tonight at 10; admission is $13.50 (Powers).</p>
        <p>MOE, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Moe, from upstate New York, is one of the most invigorating bands on the jam-rock circuit. It keeps adding options to its core of Grateful Dead and Allman Brothers rock: reggae, Little Feat funk, touches of jazz. It's best onstage, where it can turn a minuscule little riff into music that keeps on generating unexpected ideas. Tonight and tomorrow at 9; admission is $22 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* ''THE MUSIC NEVER STOPS,'' Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100. Picking up where Betty Carter's ''Jazz Ahead'' program left off, the singer Abbey Lincoln -- another conscientious developer of young talent -- leads this annual display of young jazz performers, who through the corporate and public funds collected by this program have been set on a rehearsal schedule and given time to develop original music. Ms. Lincoln herself will perform with her trio, as will the pianist Geri Allen, the drummer Jack DeJohnette and the bassist Cecil McBee. But the players to concentrate on are the dozen or so celebrated up-and-comers, including the trombonist Andre Hayward, the bassist Eric Revis, the pianist Travis Shook and the saxophonist Mark Shim. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $20 and $35 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>THE NEVILLE BROTHERS/ROBERT CRAY/ JON LUCIEN/ELLIOTT SHARP'S TERRAPLANE/SEX MOB, Austin J. Tobin Plaza, World Trade Center, Lower Manhattan, (212) 219-3006. Funk, blues and jazz are all branches of the African-American musical diaspora, and at this afternoon-long free concert, listeners can make their own connections. The Neville Brothers have lately wasted too much of their sets on cover tunes but can still generate the New Orleans funk they helped invent in songs like ''Fiyo on the Bayou.'' Robert Cray, who brings convincing passion to songs about a tortured conscience, meshes blues with Memphis soul. Jon Lucien is a supple rhythm-and-blues crooner; Elliott Sharp's Terraplane is the prolific guitarist and composer's blues outlet. And Sex Mob applies the lessons of avant-gutbucket jazz to radically remake familiar songs. Tomorrow at 1 p.m.; admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>LEON PARKER QUINTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Since establishing himself as one of the important drummers of the 90's, Mr. Parker has periodically disassembled and reassembled his great trio with Jacky Terrasson, experimented with solo and duo playing in his own brand of performance art, and generally confounded expectations. He's a swinging player with a stripped-down, smacking sound, but also a student of rhythm from around the world. Sets through Sunday night are at 9:30 and 11:30, with a 1 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $20 tonight and tomorrow; $15 on Sunday. There is a $10 minimum for all sets (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* SIXTH ELEMENT, Randall's Island, (212) 307-7171 or www.6thelement.com. Dance club denizens may venture into daylight for this 10-hour marathon of top disc jockeys spinning on five stages, along with 10 groups including live musicians. The lineup spans old-school hip-hop (Kool D.J. Herc, Afrika Bambaataa), current trance (Dave Ralph, Sandra Collins), skittering drum 'n' bass (Aphrodite), techno plus stage antics (Rabbit in the Moon), house music (Erick Morillo, Tony Humphries) and rocker-turned-disc jockey Perry Farrell from Jane's Addiction, along with ambient music and other genres and subgenres in between. It includes an art and sound installation by Soundlab. Tomorrow at 2 p.m.; admission is $45 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>TANGUARDIA, BAM Cafe, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4139. Bob Telson, the composer of ''The Gospel at Colonnus'' and the globe-hopping ''Warrior Ant,'' has turned to the tango, playing piano with a group that also includes bandoneon (the Argentine accordion) and guitar. Tomorrow night at 9:30; no cover, $10 minimum (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* LOS VAN VAN, LOS LOBOS, BARBARITO TORRES, DAVID SANCHEZ, BOBBY SANABRIA Y ASCENSION, Austin J. Tobin Plaza, World Trade Center, Lower Manhattan, (212) 219-3006. This Latin extravaganza delves into salsa, rock and jazz. Los Van Van, founded in 1969, are Cuba's top dance band, and on stage their songs stretch into well-plotted jams that keep coming up with new delights. Los Lobos, the Mexican-American band from East Los Angeles, explore subterranean connections between blues, rhythm-and-blues, nortena music and hints of salsa; they've moved a long way from ''La Bamba.'' Barbarito Torres, who was in the Buena Vista Social Club, plays the laud, the brawny Cuban adaptation of the lute, with a speed demon's delight in flamboyance.  And David Sanchez and Bobby Sanabria y Ascension play exhilarating Latin jazz that prizes the connection to the dance floor. Sunday at 1 p.m.; admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>JEFF TAIN WATTS EXPERIENCE/RAVI COLTRANE QUINTET, Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 343-8805. The sets are tonight at 8 (Mr. Watts) and 10 (Mr. Coltrane); price for admission to all stages within the building for the night is $30, including performances by Michael Formanek's Northern Exposure, Yuko Fujiyama, and the Cindy Blackman Quartet (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>''WELCOME TO THE VOICE: AN OPERA,'' Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, (212) 840-2824. Steve Nieve, the man who tinkled the pianos on many a legendary Elvis Costello album, steps into the composer's role with a story he has called simple and optimistic. The filmmaker Muriel Teodori is co-author of the work. Mr. Nieve gets some help from his friends, including Mr. Costello, the Brodsky Quartet and Ron Sexsmith. This performance is part of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival. Tonight at 8; tickets are $40 (Powers).</p>
        <p>JOHN ZORN'S CHAMBER WORKS, Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, Angel Orensanz Foundation, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 343-8805. Not to be confused with Mr. Zorn's chamber-music versions of his popular Masada project, these are performances of his high-concept classical pieces from 1983 to the present, by a group of musicians including the pianist Stephen Drury, the violinist Mark Feldman, the violist Lois Martin and the cellist Erik Friedlander. The compositions, spread across two sets, include ''Cat o' Nine Tails,'' ''Dead Man,'' ''Kol Nidre,'' ''Carny,'' and seven others. Tonight at 8 and 10:30; admission is $25 (Ratliff).</p>
