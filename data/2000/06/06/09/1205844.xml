        <p>''The typewriter,'' goes a dated piece of verse by D. J. Enright, ''is creating a revolution in poetry.'' The digital video camera, we have been hearing lately, is having the same effect on filmmaking. Cheap, portable, easy to use, the new technology puts cinematic expression in reach of the masses. At a recent documentary festival, everyone I spoke to seemed to come up with the same analogy: the camera has become less like a printing press and more like a pencil, something you can grab hold of when the mood strikes, and use to transform your impressions into art.</p>
        <p>The camera as pencil is a new twist on an old idea, the ''camera-stylo,'' a phrase coined by the French ethnologist and filmmaker Jean Rouch, who also invented the term cinema verite, now the title of an informative documentary by Peter Wintonick. Is cinema verite a style or a movement? A technique or a philosophy? Or is it, as Frederick Wiseman, one of its great avatars, suggests, a piece of ''pretentious and pompous'' French jargon?</p>
        <p>Cinema verite is the preferred English term for what the French like to call direct cinema, and is itself a translation of Kino Pravda, a movement dreamed up in 1919 by the early Soviet director Dziga Vertov. One of the peculiarities of film history is that what might seem to be the movie camera's most obvious power -- the capacity to record reality as it unfolds -- should require theories, manifestoes and a specialized, multilingual vocabulary.</p>
        <p>It has also demanded, and inspired, technological innovations. Decades before the coming of High 8 and digital video, shoulder-mounted cameras and synchronized sound gave filmmakers the opportunity to wade into the jostle and unpredictability of daily life, which they recreated in the tranquillity of the editing room.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wintonick's film, which opens today at the Screening Room, gamely revisits the epistemological quandaries that have always troubled documentarians. He also talks to younger filmmakers who have adapted the hand-held, in-the-moment aesthetic to make music videos, fictional television shows and of course ''The Blair Witch Project.'' Along the way some old, still urgent philosophical questions are broached: Does the camera see the world or imagine it? Does the story belong to the people behind the camera or the ones in front of it? Is there any truth in cinema verite?</p>
        <p>One thing is certain: There is very little cinema verite in ''Cinema Verite,'' which is a sprightly collage of talking-head interviews and borrowed clips. The first of these is from an old Canadian instructional film called ''The Extension Ladder,'' a fish-in-the-barrel example of the old, boring documentary style that was swept away by a loosely affiliated band of rebels including Richard Leacock, Albert Maysles, D. A. Pennebaker, Karel Reisz and Robert Drew, all of whom turn up to reminisce and philosophize for Mr. Wintonick's friendly, patient cameras.</p>
        <p>Not that the film is an exercise in nostalgia. Yes, Mr. Wintonick feasts on the black-and-white glories of old movies both famous and obscure: Mr. Reisz's ''We Are the Lambeth Boys,'' Mr. Pennebaker's ''Don't Look Back,'' Michel Brault's ''Raquetteurs'' and episodes of the Canadian series ''Candid Eye.''</p>
        <p>But he also makes room for Barbara Kopple (who made ''Harlan County, U.S.A.'' and ''Wild Man Blues'') in her fearless prime, and for Jennifer Fox, a skeptical inheritor of the verite tradition who made ''An American Love Story,'' shown on PBS last year.</p>
        <p>Most of the old-timers are still active, still following the first rule of cinematic truth telling: shoot and shoot and then shoot some more. Toward the end we find Mr. Leacock, the movement's guru and provocateur at 80, looking into a digital viewfinder and proclaiming that there has never been a more exciting time to be making movies. Who could disagree?</p>
