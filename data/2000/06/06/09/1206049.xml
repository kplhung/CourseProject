        <p>The Stanley Cup is still within reach of the Devils. But for now, their reach exceeds their grasp. With a chance to clinch the trophy on home ice, they lost by 1-0 in the third overtime this morning to the Dallas Stars, the defending champions.</p>
        <p>The winning goal was scored at 6 minutes 21 seconds of the third overtime by Mike Modano, who cut across the slot and deflected Brett Hull's shot past Devils goalie Martin Brodeur. Hull had fired from near the blue line on the right-wing side of the zone.</p>
        <p>The result left the Devils with a three-games-to-two lead in the four-of-seven-game championship round, which will resume Saturday night in Dallas. The Devils are still the likely champions. Since the National Hockey League instituted the seven-game format for the championship round in 1939, only one team has overcome a 3-1 deficit. That was the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, who came from being down, 3-0, to beat Detroit.</p>
        <p>But the Devils also know that a precedent was set -- by them -- in the previous round when they came from being down by 3-1 to eliminate the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
        <p>In the first overtime, signs of fatigue began to be seen on both sides, but scoring chances were plentiful. Hull, the Dallas sniper, had two good tries. Brodeur stopped his slap shot after the Stars won a face-off in the New Jersey end. Moments later, Hull beat Brodeur on the glove side, but the shot sailed wide.</p>
        <p>The Devils had a 10-5 shooting edge in the period. Two of their better chances were by Sergei Brylin on a backhander from short range and by Scott Stevens on a long wrist shot from the blue line.</p>
        <p>In the second overtime, both sides used borderline tactics to get an edge or prevent a goal. Hull fired pucks whenever possible. Peter Sykora cracked a slap shot off Ed Belfour's mask. When Modano threatened to cut around Stevens, the Devils defenseman tripped him and landed on him, causing Modano to wince in pain on the bench.</p>
        <p>Derian Hatcher charged toward the net to get a good chance from the slot on a three-on-two passing combination. Brodeur blocked it. Alexander Mogilny got a breakaway for the Devils but his low wrister was turned away by Belfour.</p>
        <p>With about six minutes left after an easy save by Belfour, Claude Lemieux gave the goalie a full shower of ice chips by screeching his skates to a halt, purposefully, a few feet from the goalie, who was on his knees. Less than a minute later, at the other end, Broduer stopped Mike Keane's rebound after Guy Carbonneau's wicked, long shot.</p>
        <p>When Brylin of the Devils took a pass and split the Devils' defense, he was pulled down by Hatcher and the crowd booed when no penalty was called. As the clock passed 1 a.m., the players returned for the third overtime of the night.</p>
        <p>Earlier Thursday, Devils Coach Larry Robinson discussed what it is like to play in games that could clinch the cup, drawing on his years as a Montreal defenseman.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if anybody knows what it takes to get that final win,'' Robinson said. ''I told them this morning, I said if you are nervous, then you should be. If you are scared, then you should be. That is what playoffs is all about.</p>
        <p>''And it is not -- it is not a fear as we know it. It is not like a fear of dying or a fear of falling off a bridge or whatever. It is just -- it is a different kind of feeling that you get, knowing that it is so close, but yet know that it is again so far away.''</p>
        <p>The Devils outshot the Stars by 18-17 in the first two periods, and New Jersey had a slight edge in good scoring chances. Scott Gomez of the Devils had a good opportunity in the first period while the teams skated with one man each in the penalty box. Lemieux set him up with a pass across the slot, but Gomez couldn't get his stick on it.</p>
        <p>The Stars best chance came on a four-on-two rush, but Modano, open near Brodeur's net, could not control a difficult pass. In the final minute of the period, Bobby Holik was set up by Brian Rafalski, but Belfour, the Dallas goalie, slid across and blocked the puck.</p>
        <p>In the second period, Dallas got a good early chance, with two shots in quick succession. The best stop by Brodeur was the second, on Sylvain Cote's try at the rebound. During a Dallas power play, Jere Lehtinen got open in the slot, but Brodeur made a glove save. Moments later, when Hull fanned on a shot, Lemieux checked him hard and knocked off his helmet. As Hull skated toward the bench, Brodeur shot the helmet toward him.</p>
        <p>During a Devils power play late in the period, Holik had two good scoring chances from close range. On the second, he backhanded a rebound to the outside of the net, near the post. For a brief moment, the arena horn blew, signaling a goal that wasn't.</p>
        <p>The tension grew during the third period as both teams threatened, the Devils more often than the Stars. Joe Nieuwendyk of Dallas came close on a wraparound and Grant Marshall of the Stars was stopped by Brodeur on a low shot after being set up by Modano, who was double-shifted this time.</p>
        <p>At the other end, Gomez shot a low wrister during a 2-on-1 break and Belfour blocked the drive. Holik had another great chance with 3:09 remaining in regulation, but was stopped as he tried to put the puck between Belfour's pads.</p>
