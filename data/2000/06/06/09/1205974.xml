        <p>The newspaper industry, already radically changed this year by the pending merger of the Tribune Company and Times Mirror, was reshaped yesterday as one company offered itself for sale, a second consolidated its dominance in daily circulation and a third moved into first place in the sheer number of newspaper properties it owns.</p>
        <p>Central Newspapers Inc., owner of The Arizona Republic, the country's 11th-largest daily; The Indianapolis Star; and four other daily newspapers announced it was up for sale. The move would take another multigeneration newspaper family, the Pulliams, out of the business.</p>
        <p>A few hours later, a second announcement confirmed that the Gannett Company and Community Newspaper Holdings Inc. were growing bigger by buying the bulk of the 49 newspapers the Thomson Corporation had put on the block four months ago.</p>
        <p>Gannett is paying $1.13 billion for 21 daily newspapers in Louisiana, Maryland, Ohio, Wisconsin and Utah. With the acquisition, the company enhances its dominance in the daily circulation division. It will now own 94 newspapers, including its flagship, USA Today, with a combined circulation of about seven million. The 31 newspapers of No. 2 Knight Ridder have a combined daily circulation of just under four million.</p>
        <p>Community Newspaper Holdings, which is financed by the resources of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, paid $455 million for 17 papers in Indiana, southern Georgia and the Appalachian region of West Virginia and western Maryland. After the purchase, the company will own 112 daily newspapers with a combined circulation of almost 1.1 1 million.</p>
        <p>Owen Van Essen, the president of Dirks, Van Essen &amp; Murray, the newspaper brokerage firm based in New Mexico, said yesterday that these deals, coupled with the $8 billion purchase of Times Mirror by the Tribune Company and a variety of other pending agreements were likely to push the total amount of money spent on newspaper purchases to $15 billion by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>For the newspaper industry, that is a breathtaking number, 150 percent higher than ever before. As Mr. Van Essen said, ''The previous record was $6.2 billion in 1997, and we blew through that with the Tribune deal alone.''</p>
        <p>''Relative to other media segments, the amounts are still very, very small,'' Mr. Van Essen said. ''There's going to be $40 billion of TV that sells and $30 billion of radio and probably $50 billion of cable. By newspaper standards, this is a lot of activity. But the consolidation frenzy is just catching on with newspapers.''</p>
        <p>The announcement of Central Newspapers -- whose stock symbol, ECP, mirrors its founder's initials -- powered its stock to a 65 percent gain yesterday; the share price increased by $20.50, to $52.</p>
        <p>But with all the mergers, the vestiges of hometown newspapering are fewer and fewer. The conservative Pulliam family -- one of whose members is Dan Quayle, the former vice president -- was strongly identified with Indianapolis, where it published two newspapers until The Indianapolis News folded last fall.</p>
        <p>Gregory Favre, a vice president of the McClatchy Company whose tour in newspapering has given him a close view of a generation's worth of changes in the industry, said yesterday that the Pulliam family, ''meant a tremendous amount in Indianapolis -- like any great publishing family.'' He added, ''It's a loss to any community to lose a family like that.''</p>
        <p>The proposed sale is the second instance this year of a multigeneration newspaper family deciding to sell the business it created.</p>
        <p>And, as with the Chandlers in Los Angeles, the controlling shares of the company -- in Central's case, the Class B shares -- were held in trust for the Pulliam descendants. As with the Chandler trusts, the Eugene C. Pulliam trust contained language that posed a barrier to any sale.</p>
        <p>According to the trust document, the limitations on the trustees' power to sell their Central stock ''shall become void'' if they determine that remaining independent would ''seriously threaten'' to cause ''substantially complete loss'' of the shares' value.</p>
        <p>But Central's dropping stock price -- before yesterday, it had lost 20 percent of its value this year -- and the very high valuations that newspapers have commanded recently helped create a climate in which the three trustees -- the former chief executive, Frank E. Russell; the current chief executive, Louis H. Weil; and Myrta J. Pulliam, a granddaughter of the company's founder -- decided to sell.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Weil nor Ms. Pulliam would comment on the decision when contacted yesterday.</p>
        <p>Stuart Garner, the president of Thomson Newspapers, kept his comments brief, saying that he was ''very pleased'' with the prices the two companies paid for the 38 newspapers. Someone else who knew the terms of the deal said that Gannett and Community Newspaper Holdings paid prices that averaged about 12.8 times 12-month earnings before interest and taxes. The sale of the remaining 11 daily newspapers in the United States is expected to be completed within days. One source said there were four potential buyers, including Media General, which is based in Richmond, Va.</p>
        <p>Also out for bid are a large group of newspapers currently owned by Hollinger International Inc., the company of Conrad Black, as well as some smaller-circulation newspapers owned by The New York Times Company. None of these match the size of The Republic, which has a daily circulation of 482,000. The Republic's daily circulation dipped slightly in the last reporting period, but not as much as that of The Star, which dropped more than 8 percent, to 247,000.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, although no executives of likely buyers like Knight Ridder and McClatchy would talk on the record about the prospects, one who spoke on condition of anonymity said: ''Phoenix is a great market. And Indianapolis is a community that is growing tremendously.''</p>
