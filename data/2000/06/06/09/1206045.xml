        <p>Martin Brodeur bent over in disbelief. He was on the losing end of the longest 1-0 game in Stanley Cup finals history.</p>
        <p>The Stars' Mike Modano poked the puck through Brodeur's legs just 6 minutes 21 seconds into the third overtime this morning, collecting a pass from Brent Hull for the victory over the Devils in Game 5.</p>
        <p>For Brodeur, it was the second painful experience with multiple overtimes. In 1994 the goalie lost by 1-0 in quadruple overtime to the Buffalo Sabres in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals, having stopped 49 of 50 shots.</p>
        <p>Until Game 5, Martin Brodeur was the best goalie by far in this series.  He stopped 40 of 41 shots, but Ed Belfour was better, stopping all 48 shots he faced.</p>
        <p>Twenty days ago Brodeur and the Devils were down, three games to one, to the Philadelphia Flyers in the National Hockey League's Eastern Conference finals. After allowing 11 agonizing goals in three straight losses, Brodeur morphed into a ruthless sentinel. New Jersey was not going to lose the cup on his watch.</p>
        <p>As he resurrected his play, allowing just three goals in the final three games against Philadelphia, his teammates surged ahead with him, all the way to Game 5 at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>With expectation and anticipation squeezing the tension to the breaking point, Brodeur engaged in an end-to-end duel with Belfour, who was having his best game of the series.</p>
        <p>Something had to give, but neither goalie would give in during regulation. Belfour stopped 27 shots; Brodeur stopped 22, outdoing Belfour and himself with every save. In the first overtime, Belfour stopped 10 more shots, Brodeur 5.</p>
        <p>Although it seemed that every save Belfour and Brodeur were making was the crucial one, Brodeur had a remarkable stop with just four minutes left in the second overtime that preserved the scoreless tie. He got a pad on Guy Carbonneau's slap shot from the right circle and when Mike Keane collected the rebound in the slot and got off another shot, Brodeur made a kick save on the Stars' best chance of the period.</p>
        <p>At one point, this game seemed primed to turn on Brodeur's three power-play saves late in the second period when the Stars were threatening to cancel the Devils' celebration this weekend in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>With just under five minutes to play in the period, and 35 seconds into the power play, Brodeur saw the puck slither from behind him, by the right post and directly in front of the goal to a salivating Jere Lehtinen, who attempted to one-time it past Brodeur.</p>
        <p>Brodeur sprawled horizontally in front of his net as if he were posing for a fitness video, his right leg doing a scissors kick 45 degrees into the tense air, his left leg flat on the ice. To those accustomed to Brodeur by this point in the playoffs, it might have appeared to be a simple exercise. For Dallas and Lehtinen, it was yet another exercise in futility. Brodeur's left glove hand rose into the air and snared Lehtinen's shot like a fly at the dinner table.</p>
        <p>Forty seconds later, Brodeur made another save, and then, with his renowned strength, cleared the puck up the length of the ice with a wrist shot. The crowd roared to another decibel level. He was not done. Could he leap tall buildings in a single bound? Brodeur turned back the third shot of the power play and the Stars' Brett Hull whiffed on his ensuing chance, perhaps a symbolic image of the entire cup finals.</p>
        <p>So forgive that 11-goal lapse in those three games against the Flyers. Brodeur did not forget them, however, using them as motivation to be better than he was showing. Since then, coming into Game 5, he had been 6-1, with a 1.42 goals-against average.</p>
        <p>Before today's 1-0 loss, Brodeur had allowed just seven goals in four games, for a 1.75 goals against average, allowing just two of those goals in Reunion Arena.</p>
        <p>That was the same average Brodeur held in 1995 against the Detroit Red Wings when the Devils won the cup. It is five years later. He is 28 now, with three toddler sons, who were happily playing floor hockey with plastic sticks outside the family waiting room before the game, wearing their father's jersey.</p>
        <p>In the five years since winning his first Stanley Cup, Brodeur has matured into the Devils' household leader as well. He was voted most valuable player by his teammates for the fifth straight season this season. And before Modano's goal in the third overtime, this game could have been seen as his crowning performance.</p>
