        <p>Three advertisers have named AG Worldwide in New York, part of the Draft Worldwide unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, to handle their accounts, with combined billings estimated at $54 million.</p>
        <p>Red Cube in Zurich, which offers customized telecommunications, media and Internet services, named AG to handle its first account. The decision came after a six-week review that had been narrowed to AG and the New York office of Wieden &amp; Kennedy.</p>
        <p>Artland.com in New York, a Web site offering digital reproductions of paintings and photographs, named AG and a sibling, Surge Interactive, to handle its first account. That decision came without a review.</p>
        <p>And the worldwide account for the Jose Cuervo line of tequilas was consolidated by naming AG in New York and a sibling, Instinct AG in London, to handle those duties. The decision came after a six-month review that had been narrowed to AG and three other agencies: Bartle Bogle Hegarty in London, which is 49 percent owned by the B Com3  Group; the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, part of B Com3 ; and J. Walter Thompson in New York, part of the WPP Group. In the United States, the Jose Cuervo brand is marketed by United Distillers and Vintners North America in Stamford, Conn., part of Diageo P.L.C.; Grybauskas Beatrice in New York had handled Jose Cuervo for United Distillers. Outside this country, the brand is sold by Jose Cuervo International in Mexico City.</p>
