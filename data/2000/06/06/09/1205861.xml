        <p>''Who would want to go to a party that actually lets you know where it is?'' vents a very frustrated Neil (Jeff Witzke) in ''Groove,'' the shambling but mostly knowing and funny comedy from the director Greg Harrison. If you're nostalgic for the days of chasing around the city to find a gig and arriving just in time to see a pair of 16-year-olds earnestly discussing the merits of drum-and-bass versus jungle music, then ''Groove'' is the movie for you. And if you're not so inclined, the film's seductive lack of pretension will make a fan of you.</p>
        <p>The only showy sequence in the entire picture is at the beginning, and its portent is used as a joke: a garage door ominously cranks open and four figures stand dramatically backlighted, with rain pouring behind them. This Impossible Mission Force is Ernie (Steve Van Wormer) and his crew checking out an abandoned warehouse as a rave site.</p>

        <p>''Who would want to go to a party that actually lets you know where it is?'' vents a very frustrated Neil (Jeff Witzke) in ''Groove,'' the shambling but mostly knowing and funny comedy from the director Greg Harrison. If you're nostalgic for the days of chasing around the city to find a gig and arriving just in time to see a pair of 16-year-olds earnestly discussing the merits of drum-and-bass versus jungle music, then ''Groove'' is the movie for you. And if you're not so inclined, the film's seductive lack of pretension will make a fan of you.</p>
        <p>The only showy sequence in the entire picture is at the beginning, and its portent is used as a joke: a garage door ominously cranks open and four figures stand dramatically backlighted, with rain pouring behind them. This Impossible Mission Force is Ernie (Steve Van Wormer) and his crew checking out an abandoned warehouse as a rave site.</p>
        <p>The movie takes place in San Francisco over the course of a single night, with the word of the supposedly hush-hush party getting out via the Internet and pagers. Although Mr. Harrison uses two elements so venerable that they have calcified into institutions -- the rave scene and the life-changing-night scenario, which was a dried chestnut even when ''American Graffiti'' employed it -- the director manages to make ''Groove'' about moments.</p>
        <p>There's a girl staring contentedly at a spinning dryer while her Walkman pumps it up, and Guy (Dmitri), Ernie's second in command, riding the BART with a huge mirrored disco ball on his lap. Like ''Graffiti,'' ''Groove'' does away with plot and instead uses its wild-party setting to follow several people who are attending the rave, or trying their best to find it.</p>
        <p>This film doesn't assume the pose that raves are anything new or dangerous; rather, the view is that they're an entrenched circuit with tribal complications.</p>
        <p>And that's where the comedy is. The surly Todd (Angelo Spizziri), who gets many of the best lines while waiting for his Ecstasy high to kick in, observes that if the girls weren't all sporting Tickle Me Elmo backpacks, they'd be hot.</p>
        <p>''When'd you go all Haight-Ashbury on me?'' he barks at his psychotropic connoisseur friend Cliff (Ari Gold, who directs sharp short films when he's not acting). ''You used to listen to Nitzer Ebb.''</p>
        <p>Moments before, Cliff -- a teaching assistant during the day -- was spotted by a couple of his students. When it's clicking, ''Groove'' connects like an Ecstasy-fueled screwball comedy: everyone's synapses get scrambled by their desires and by the juiced beats per minute.</p>
        <p>Unlike other films built around electronica song scores, which employ every sleight of hand at the filmmakers' disposal, ''Groove'' settles assuredly into a spartan look at the world of the rave. How sad; now that even Ronald McDonald was featured in a commercial at an underground spot a few years back, movies about raves are finally getting made.</p>
        <p>There have probably been more rave movies in the last 12 months than there were in the previous decade. It's too bad that none were produced in the early 1990's, when the scene had some currency and Orbital's ''Halcyon'' -- which is part of the well-selected soundtrack -- could raise the roof.</p>
        <p>At times here, there's a high corn quotient. Lola Glaudini is the jaded Leyla, who is a little too old to still be hitting raves and is looking for something worthy of commitment. David (Hamish Linklater) is at his first rave and tries showing some game by telling Leyla he's from back East -- East Lansing.</p>
        <p>One of the film's inside jokes is that he grew up a little more than an hour from the home of techno music, Detroit, and was too nervous to make that trip.</p>
        <p>The film doesn't dwell on the many firsts that occur, like David's inaugural rave experience and Ecstasy consumption. ''Groove'' often belongs to Ernie, who is a techno altruist; he'd have to be, since he's charging only two bucks a head for a till-dawn jam that includes food and bottled water. He's down with the politics of dancing, so chilled that even a police bust cannot stop him, evoking the Alan Freed of ''American Hot Wax.'' And when he finally gets a chance to hit the floor -- ''You have control of the bridge,'' he tells his pal Guy -- the spark in his eyes is as potent as any of the mood-altering substances being passed around.</p>
        <p>The film's real barometer is Maggie, played by the willowy Elizabeth Sun. Whenever things are bumping, there she is, her twists shaking like it's all good. And ''Groove'' is just that.</p>
        <p>It would have been better only if the last shot were from an earlier scene: Todd's high, as it finally kicks in and he toys with a globe like a stoned kitten.</p>
        <p>''Groove'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes party language and many, many drug references.</p>
