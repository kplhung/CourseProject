        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>GORE ADDRESSES PRIVACY -- Last year, 20-year-old Amy Boyer of New Hampshire was killed by a man who had bought her Social Security number for $45 from a Web site and then tracked her down. Vice President Al Gore, who early on took an interest in Internet and privacy issues, held several discussions with her parents about ''identity theft'' and yesterday, in a campaign stop in Whittier, Calif., he proposed making it a federal crime to sell Social Security numbers. ''Let's put security back in Social Security,'' Mr. Gore said, the family at his side. As he spoke, Democratic allies in Washington were introducing a bill in Congress to make it a civil and criminal offense for someone to sell or buy another person's Social Security number without that person's consent. The Social Security Administration logged 30,000 complaints of abuse of numbers in 1999, an increase of 175 percent over 1998, and the theft of numbers accounts for much of the increase in cyber crimes and identity theft.</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>DISENCHANTED DONORS -- Political donors are still giving, but they are increasingly disenchanted with the way campaigns are being run, a new poll has found. In the survey, conducted by the Institute for Global Ethics, a nonpartisan organization in Washington, 76 percent of the respondents said attack-oriented campaigns were wrong, and 59 percent said such campaigns were on the increase. What to make of that? Nearly half of the respondents said that in the future they would be more likely to contribute to a candidate who ''publicly signs a code of conduct.'' Brad Rourke, the institute's vice president, said, ''When even the people who fund campaigns voice serious concern about the tenor of campaigns and call for reform, it is clearly time for change.'' The survey covered 600 donors of all political persuasions whose contributions ranged from $200 to $500, and was conducted from April 25 to May 1. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.</p>

        <p>THE OTHER CONTEST</p>
        <p>A BOLD STAND ON BASKETBALL -- It was a free throw for Al Gore. Asked yesterday to pick the winner of the N.B.A. finals, the vice president blurted out: ''Lakers.'' Like other politicians, Mr. Gore does not normally like to pick sides in sporting events. But he was in Los Angeles. And California, with the biggest block of electoral votes, is crucial to his presidential bid. Besides, the Lakers' rivals, the Pacers, are from Indiana, a small state that almost always votes Republican. So what did he have to lose when a local television reporter asked him which team he was rooting for? In supporting the Lakers, Mr. Gore may also have been trying to repay a favor to Shaquille O'Neal, the Laker star, who endorsed him after Michael Jordan threw his support to Bill Bradley, Mr. Gore's erstwhile rival. Asked what he would say to Pacers' fans, the vice president said: ''I try to avoid the subject.''</p>
