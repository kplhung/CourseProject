        <p>Construction workers began building a soaring 45-story Westin hotel yesterday in a once forbidding area west of Times Square, at the southeast corner of Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street.</p>
        <p>The $300 million, 858-room hotel, which would be part of the E Walk entertainment complex on 42nd Street, is the latest example of a boom in which analysts expect a record-breaking year for both hotel occupancy rates and room rates, which are the highest in the country. With many of the hotels in Manhattan effectively full, analysts expect that an additional 7,000 hotel rooms will be built in the next four years.</p>

        <p>Construction workers began building a soaring 45-story Westin hotel yesterday in a once forbidding area west of Times Square, at the southeast corner of Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street.</p>
        <p>The $300 million, 858-room hotel, which would be part of the E Walk entertainment complex on 42nd Street, is the latest example of a boom in which analysts expect a record-breaking year for both hotel occupancy rates and room rates, which are the highest in the country. With many of the hotels in Manhattan effectively full, analysts expect that an additional 7,000 hotel rooms will be built in the next four years.</p>
        <p>Westin, a chain owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts, will operate the hotel on Eighth Avenue. And five blocks away, Starwood signed a deal on Wednesday to take over the 52-story hotel nearing completion at Broadway and 47th Street as part of its W Hotels chain.</p>
        <p>The occupancy rate at Manhattan hotels rose to 89.1 percent in April, the highest point in the last 20 years, according to a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting firm. During the same month, average room rates reached $245.27, 11.7 percent higher than April 1999. And reservations for the summer and fall are running unusually strong.</p>
        <p>''It suggests that 2000 may be the best year on record for the New York City hotel business,'' said Sean Hennessey, director of the hotel consulting business at PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>
        <p>Only five years ago, many hotel owners and developers said they would never venture as far west as Eighth Avenue, because 42nd Street was too seedy to support a luxury hotel. Since then, 42nd Street and Times Square have blossomed with restaurants, television studios, game rooms, theaters and office buildings. The hotels have followed.</p>
        <p>Designed by Arquitectonica, the Westin Hotel will be split from top to bottom by a striking curved beam of light. The project is owned and developed by Tishman Realty and Construction Company, which is building the E Walk complex.</p>
        <p>Across the street, the Hilton Times Square, with 444 rooms, had its grand opening on Tuesday on the south side of 42nd Street, next door to the entertainment complex that includes Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, a 25-screen AMC multiplex movie house and HMV Records.</p>
        <p>The hotel industry in New York City has made a remarkable recovery since 1991, when nearly half the hotel rooms in the city were left empty by a recession and the war in the Persian Gulf. Five years later, the hotel industry cried poverty and persuaded city officials to reduce the hotel tax by six percentage points, to 15.25 percent. Since then, hotel owners have raised the average room rate in Manhattan by 54.3 percent, to more than $245 a night.</p>
        <p>And in the process, Times Square became contested territory. Gary Barnett, an owner of Intell Investment and Management, and Madison Equities, began construction two years ago at Broadway and 47th Street with a plan to create a Planet Hollywood Hotel.</p>
        <p>The theme restaurant chain planned to move its flagship restaurant there from 57th Street. But Intell put the hotel up for sale after Planet Hollywood tumbled into bankruptcy court last year and sold its stake in the project back to Intell for about $32 million.</p>
        <p>Sheraton, Hard Rock and a number of other companies competed for the project, and on Sunday it appeared that the Radisson hotel chain had won out with a bid to run the hotel as a joint venture. But at the last minute, real estate executives said, Starwood jumped in and grabbed the deal with an offer worth an estimated $175 million to lease the hotel and retail space for 25 years.</p>
        <p>Intell will retain the 300-foot-tall steel columns on the hotel that serve as a superstructure for the illuminated billboards, which are worth millions of dollars a year in rental fees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hennessey, the hotel analyst, said that Starwood, which owns the Sheraton, Westin, St. Regis and W chains, has been eager to open a hotel on the West Side of Manhattan, where it may be able to reap bigger profits as patrons pay higher prices.</p>
        <p>''The room rates at West Side hotels in Manhattan have been $25 to $35 below the rates of comparable hotels on the East Side,'' Mr. Hennessey said. ''With the development of first-class office space and the evolution of Times Square, that spread is going to narrow and represent stronger than average gains for West Side hotels.''</p>
        <p>Dan Gibson, a spokesman for Starwood, confirmed yesterday that the company had signed a deal to run the hotel under the W brand. But he declined to give any details.</p>
