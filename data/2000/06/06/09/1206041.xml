        <p>The Orioles were tired of seeing Shea Stadium by last night. When their road trip was extended an extra day because of Tuesday's rainout, the Orioles spiraled into a traveling disaster. There were not enough rooms to accommodate the entire team so the Orioles flew to Baltimore after Wednesday night's game here, slept at home and then returned to New York yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Yes, it was a chore. Yes, it seemed odd that the Orioles could not locate 53 rooms in the New York metropolitan area. No, it would not have been a shock if the Mets (33-26) helped make the Orioles (24-33) look like sleepwalkers last night.</p>

        <p>The Orioles were tired of seeing Shea Stadium by last night. When their road trip was extended an extra day because of Tuesday's rainout, the Orioles spiraled into a traveling disaster. There were not enough rooms to accommodate the entire team so the Orioles flew to Baltimore after Wednesday night's game here, slept at home and then returned to New York yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Yes, it was a chore. Yes, it seemed odd that the Orioles could not locate 53 rooms in the New York metropolitan area. No, it would not have been a shock if the Mets (33-26) helped make the Orioles (24-33) look like sleepwalkers last night.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the Mets did. Kurt Abbott drilled a homer into the left-field bleachers to catapult the Mets to an 8-7 victory in 10 innings. John Franco and Armando Benitez were erratic in the ninth and Glendon Rusch was erratic for the first five innings, but the Mets climbed back from 4-0 and 6-3 deficits and then prevailed.</p>
        <p>''It was a real gutty win on our part, getting down, 4-0 and 6-3, and wanting the game more than the other team,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said.</p>
        <p>There were only 9,540 people at Shea on an unusually quiet night, and some of those had bolted when Abbott batted with one out in the 10th. Jose Mercedes entered the game to start the inning and Abbott wanted to hit a pitch to right-center. Mercedes threw a split-finger fastball that hung in the strike zone and Abbott turned it into a souvenir, climaxing the 3-hour-40-minute game.</p>
        <p>Abbott, who has replaced the injured Rey Ordonez at shortstop, was a very unlikely hero. It was only his second homer and third run batted in this year. Valentine benched Abbott for two games and told him to stop trying to be Ordonez and just be himself, which sufficed as the Mets celebrated in the 10th.</p>
        <p>''It's an unbelievable feeling,'' Abbott said. ''It was a long time coming. Rounding third and seeing all of your teammates waiting there to trample you is an incredible feeling.''</p>
        <p>The Orioles, who have lost seven of their last eight, did not depart Baltimore until 3 p.m. yesterday and did not have any pregame drills. They were either stunned, or sleepy, or both, as their porous bullpen, which has botched 14 save chances, failed again.</p>
        <p>Jay Payton's third homer in the last six games, off Mike Trombley in the eighth, put the Mets ahead, 7-6. But Franco, not Benitez, started the ninth, and he allowed a walk and a single to the three batters he faced. Mike Bordick later scored on Will Clark's bases-loaded sacrifice fly off Benitez to tie it, 7-7.</p>
        <p>Rusch, who had walked only six batters in 60 2/3 innings before last night's game, was torched for 6 earned runs on 10 hits and 3 walks in five innings, and continually tried to work through deep counts.</p>
        <p>The Orioles raced to a 4-0 lead before Todd Zeile roped a three-run homer in the fourth. When Rusch was nicked for two more to make it 6-3, the Mets scored three in the sixth on Payton's double, Abbott's sacrifice fly and Jason Tyner's single.</p>
        <p>But it was Abbott who allowed the Mets to leave Shea and happily dream of playing the Yankees. Abbott also allowed the Orioles to finally leave Flushing, hoping that they would dream about anything but being here.</p>
        <p>''It's not over yet,'' Trombley said. ''We haven't gotten home yet.''</p>
