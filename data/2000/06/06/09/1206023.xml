        <p>A New Jersey appellate panel ruled yesterday that defendants in drug cases arising from motor vehicle stops can seek dismissals based on claims they were victims of racial profiling, even off the New Jersey Turnpike, the road most closely associated with the practice.</p>
        <p>The ruling, which involved three cases in which defendants had filed similar dismissal motions, did not address whether the defendants were actually the victims of racial profiling and therefore should have their cases dismissed. Rather, the decision by a three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of State Superior Court in Hackensack directed that the cases be heard by a special judge appointed by the State Supreme Court. The ruling thus establishes a standard procedure for such claims.</p>

        <p>A New Jersey appellate panel ruled yesterday that defendants in drug cases arising from motor vehicle stops can seek dismissals based on claims they were victims of racial profiling, even off the New Jersey Turnpike, the road most closely associated with the practice.</p>
        <p>The ruling, which involved three cases in which defendants had filed similar dismissal motions, did not address whether the defendants were actually the victims of racial profiling and therefore should have their cases dismissed. Rather, the decision by a three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of State Superior Court in Hackensack directed that the cases be heard by a special judge appointed by the State Supreme Court. The ruling thus establishes a standard procedure for such claims.</p>
        <p>The decision said, ''There is a sufficient basis shown in the record of each case'' to allow those defendants to seek police records to help build cases of racial profiling.</p>
        <p>Two of the cases involved stops on roads other than the turnpike, where state troopers shot and wounded three black and Hispanic men they had stopped in April 1998.</p>
        <p>The shootings led to a state report last year that confirmed the existence of racial profiling, the practice of stopping drivers based on skin color.</p>
        <p>Chuck Davis, a spokesman for the state attorney general's office, said the state would comply with any future orders to provide state police records that could help determine whether there was a pattern of racial profiling. About 150 such motions are pending in the state trial courts, he said.</p>
        <p>William Buckman, a lawyer for Ramona Maiolino, one of the defendants involved in yesterday's ruling, said the special judge appointed for racial profiling cases, Walter R. Barasonek of Superior Court in Union County, would determine what kinds of police documents each defendant was entitled to. Mr. Buckman said the original trial judge in each case would then rule on whether racial profiling was involved and whether to dismiss the case.</p>
        <p>Of yesterday's ruling, Mr. Buckman said, ''It is significant in that the state had tried to pretend that profiling was confined to the turnpike.''</p>
