        <p>New York's highest court ruled today that the state cannot refuse to provide medical coverage for people needing long-term institutional care in cases when their spouse refuses to turn the ailing person's assets over to the government.</p>
        <p>The decision by the Court of Appeals stems from a case in which the wife of a man who is now hospitalized and in a coma transferred his assets to herself in order to make him eligible for medical benefits under the Medicaid program.</p>
        <p>In a unanimous decision, the seven-member court upheld rulings by two lower courts that allowed the woman to transfer her husband's assets to herself in her capacity as his legal guardian. The court did note that the state could still try to seek some reimbursement from the wife for the costs it incurred for her husband's care.</p>
        <p>But the ruling -- which requires Medicaid eligibility for incapacitated people to be determined without consideration of their assets, even if they have been transferred to a spouse -- could make it much harder for the state ever to recover such costs.</p>
        <p>Both the state and federal governments allow people to dispose of their assets in order to qualify for Medicaid coverage for a nursing home or other long-term care. In many instances, ailing people have simply transferred their assets to relatives to qualify for the coverage.</p>
        <p>In the case on which the court ruled today, the hospitalized man, Bipin Shah, could not dispose of his assets because he was incapacitated. The court ruled that Mr. Shah would have transferred his assets to his wife, Kashmira, had he been able to do so.</p>
        <p>Writing for the majority, Judge Joseph Bellacosa said Mrs. Shah's decision to transfer her husband's assets to herself was appropriate because ''any person in Mr. Shah's condition would have preferred that the costs of his care be paid by the state, as opposed to his family.''</p>
        <p>Ellice Fatoullah, an attorney for Mrs. Shah, said that the decision will ensure that people who are incapacitated and in need of long-term medical care will be able to dispose of their assets and qualify for Medicaid just as other ailing people are able to do now. ''The court is basically allowing an incapacitated person to do what a competent person can now do,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Juanita Scarlett, a spokeswoman for the New York State attorney general's office, said that the state would abide by the court's ruling. ''It was a close case of statutory interpretation,'' she said, ''but we respect the court's decision.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shah, an engineer who lived with his wife and two children in Upper Saddle River, N.J., was struck on the head by a crane at a construction site in Amityville on Long Island in August 1996. He suffered irreversible brain damage and has been in a coma since the accident.</p>
        <p>He was first hospitalized on Long Island. But a month later, at his wife's request, he was transferred to Helen Hayes Hospital in Rockland County, which is much closer to the family's home in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Shah's private insurance was exhausted in January 1997, the hospital told Mrs. Shah that she would have to pick up the daily $1,600 costs out of her own pocket. Mrs. Shah filed a so-called spousal refusal form, meaning that her own assets would be shielded, and applied for Medicaid on her husband's behalf.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Shah also became her husband's legal guardian and transferred his assets to herself in order to support the family and make him eligible for Medicaid. But the state attempted to block the transfer of assets, saying Mrs. Shah was not entitled to all his assets but rather only to the amount the state would normally allow her to collect from an institutionalized spouse.</p>
        <p>In the end, two lower courts ruled in Mrs. Shah's favor, and the Court of Appeals upheld those rulings today.</p>
