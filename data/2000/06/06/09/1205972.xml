        <p>The New York metropolitan area, home to the nation's largest public housing agency as well as some of the most obsessively tended suburban lawns, is on the front lines of the bug war. So it came as no surprise that the announcement yesterday by the federal government banning a commonly used pesticide sent ripples through the ranks.</p>
        <p>Some exterminators said they would turn to other chemicals in their arsenal to replace chlorpyrifos, the banned pesticide, which is found in a host of bug-killing products, including some Raid and Black Flag sprays.</p>
        <p>Several managers of lawn and garden stores pledged to pull the pesticide from their shelves. And public housing officials immediately halted use of the chemical.</p>
        <p>Until yesterday, exterminators at the New York City Housing Authority, the nation's biggest, had used Dursban Pro, which contains the banned chemical, in nonresidential parts of buildings, including basements.</p>
        <p>''Until we get some more information on this developing situation, we have sent out a notice to all of our borough management offices to stop the use of Dursban until more information is available,'' said Howard Marder, a spokesman for the housing authority. ''We are immediately beginning to investigate other products that are out there that are safe and effective and would pose no kinds of dangers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marder said Dursban was only one of many pesticides that the agency's exterminators used.</p>
        <p>A study by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation showed that in 1997, chlorpyrifos was the most commonly used pesticide throughout the state. Most of that was commercial use, doctors and environmental experts said.</p>
        <p>Dow AgroSciences is the leading manufacturer of the pesticide.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency banned chlorpyrifos after concluding that the chemical posed a risk to children because of potential harm to the nervous system and brain development.</p>
        <p>Eliot L. Spitzer, New York State's attorney general, said the federal ban did not go far enough and called for retailers to pull chlorpyrifos products from their shelves.</p>
        <p>The alarm has sent people in the New York area scrambling for anti-bug alternatives.</p>
        <p>The city housing authority has been phasing out the use of Dursban over several years, said Dr. Stephen Markowitz, who runs a medical screening program for employees of the housing authority.</p>
        <p>These days, Dr. Markowitz said, the agency's exterminators were using mostly pyrethroids, a less toxic class of chemicals.</p>
        <p>''The history of pesticides is that we find out more about them as they become used more,'' he said. ''There's limited information.''</p>
        <p>Some extermination businesses also were turning toward other pesticides. They said that although Dursban was an effective spray, other chemicals could easily replace it.</p>
        <p>And in the industry, these businesses said, there has been a growing trend toward taking preventive measures like sealing wall cracks and educating people on proper food storage.</p>
        <p>''Certainly, Dursban was one of the staples,'' said E. Randy Dupree, general manager of Acme Exterminating Company in Manhattan. ''But there are so many other products out there on the market. It certainly will not be missed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dupree said that his company began phasing out Dursban this year in anticipation of the government ban. In any case, most competent exterminators rotate through many chemicals so pests do not become resistant, he said.</p>
        <p>And for residents trying to repel bugs, one physician, Dr. Philip Landrigan, recommended using a less-toxic product, Combat, if preventive measures failed. For more than a year, Dr. Landrigan has been helping residents in East Harlem battle roaches in their apartments.</p>
        <p>In the suburbs, where Dursban is commonly applied to lawns, some stores began pulling products containing it off their shelves. Wal-Mart announced that it would stop selling chlorpyrifos products by October. And Tony Maiello, manager of the Metropolitan Plant Exchange, a plant nursery in West Orange, N.J., said he would no longer carry Dursban.</p>
        <p>''We are going to see what else is on the market that is safe,'' Mr. Maiello said. ''In the meantime, we will promote the organic products that we have that will do the same job.''</p>
        <p>Lisa Nicol, who was shopping at the plant store with her 15-month-old son, said she would check the bottles of Raid in her garage.</p>
        <p>''I'll read those labels,'' Ms. Nicol  said, ''and if they have Dursban in them, I'll throw them away.''</p>
