        <p>Marlborough</p>
        <p>40 West 57th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>Through June 24</p>
        <p>If you blended equal parts of Dubuffet, Giacometti, Guston, Kiefer and Red Grooms, you might arrive at something resembling the art of Ignacio Iturria. Mr. Iturria, who is 52 and lives in Montevideo, represented Uruguay in the 1995 Venice Biennale. In his recent paintings and sculptures in this crowded show -- the artist's first New York solo -- a big, heavy-handed, faux-primitive expressionism and an oppressive brown and black palette are leavened by an idiosyncratically comic way with form and content.</p>
        <p>A lumpy primordial man emerging from a brushy clay-colored field; a boxer resting in his corner, his face and gloves built up into gnarly relief; large trompe l'oeil paintings of cabinets with shelves bearing dishes, small portraits, medicine bottles, toys and tools; a sculpture merging the figure of an elephant and the life-size form of a sofa; cartoonish heads built onto tall, cylindrical bottles: in these and other works, the paradoxical play with illusion, abstraction, materialism and a predilection for domestic imagery bespeak a charmingly whimsical sensibility.</p>

        <p>A lumpy primordial man emerging from a brushy clay-colored field; a boxer resting in his corner, his face and gloves built up into gnarly relief; large trompe l'oeil paintings of cabinets with shelves bearing dishes, small portraits, medicine bottles, toys and tools; a sculpture merging the figure of an elephant and the life-size form of a sofa; cartoonish heads built onto tall, cylindrical bottles: in these and other works, the paradoxical play with illusion, abstraction, materialism and a predilection for domestic imagery bespeak a charmingly whimsical sensibility.</p>
        <p>It seems, however, that Mr. Iturria's antic imagination might sometimes be better served by a smaller scale, a lighter touch and a little more color. Instructively, one of the show's most engaging works, a notebook-size painting of a tiny naked couple waist deep in the water of a bathroom sink, is also one of its smallest.</p>
