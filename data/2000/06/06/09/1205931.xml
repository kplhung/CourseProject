        <p>AT&amp;T's filing of rate hikes the same day that it and the Federal Communications Commission were holding press briefings to announce phone rate reductions borders on duplicitous and was surely inept. The F.C.C.'s outrage, expressed this week after The Times reported the rate hikes, also lacks candor. AT&amp;T swiftly withdrew the rate hikes. But the bad feelings will linger.</p>
        <p>The commission announced with fanfare on May 31 that it had forged an agreement whereby it would cut access charges that the long-distance carriers pay to local phone companies for use of their wires. In exchange, the carriers agreed to pass the savings along to customers as rate cuts. Specifically, AT&amp;T promised to eliminate a $3 minimum that was part of its basic rate schedule -- a major saving for customers who make few or no long-distance calls in a particular month.</p>
        <p>But that same day AT&amp;T also filed notice that it would raise some of its per-minute charges on basic customers. It raised rates from 16 cents a minute to 29 cents on weekday evenings and from 11.5 cents to 29 cents on Saturdays. The rate for Sunday was cut from 11.5 cents to 7 cents. These rates have now been withdrawn.</p>
        <p>After The Times broke the story of the rate hikes, the commission chairman, William Kennard, charged that AT&amp;T had misled the panel. That is partly true. AT&amp;T had promised to notify basic-rate customers of any rate hikes and it did not. Nor does AT&amp;T win points for candor. At the press briefing during which it promised to cut phone rates as access charges fell, AT&amp;T said nothing about raising rates 150 percent on Saturdays.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kennard's outrage over the rate hikes is also unconvincing. Documents clearly say that AT&amp;T had warned the commission that some per-minute rates would be raised. The company says the loss of revenue from eliminating the $3 minimum charge on its basic-rate customers swamps the benefit of paying lower access charges. The higher per-minute rates are designed to make up the shortfall. If Mr. Kennard or his staff did not know the extent of the rate hikes, they should have. The commission could have insisted on knowing before approving the agreement on access charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard misleads the public in another, subtle way. He vows to make sure that AT&amp;T lives up to its pledge to pass along the savings from lower access charges. But he cannot fulfill that pledge. AT&amp;T's rates, which are not regulated, rise and fall for many reasons. The commission cannot calculate what the company would have charged in the absence of the cut in access charges, so it cannot know whether AT&amp;T has passed on the full savings. What Mr. Kennard can say is that long-distance markets are competitive and that he is confident that competition will drive AT&amp;T's rates down as its costs fall.</p>
        <p>The commission did a fine job last month in simplifying and reducing access charges -- a feat that Mr. Kennard's predecessors failed to achieve. The commission has done a technically proficient job in translating the complex provisions of the 1996 Telecommunications Act into policies that promote vigorous competition. But this week was not the commission's finest hour. AT&amp;T behaved no better.  It did not live up to its promise to the commission or speak forthrightly to its customers.</p>
