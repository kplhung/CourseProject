        <p>Matthew Marks Gallery</p>
        <p>522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through June 23</p>
        <p>This is the first local gallery show since 1996 for Katharina Fritsch, an artist based in Dusseldorf, Germany, who has brought some memorable images to New York in the past. Among them were sculptures of giant rats and Day-Glo-colored Madonnas that caught the blend of folklore fantasy and religious fervor that runs through German popular culture.</p>
        <p>There's a fairy-tale component in this show, too, in the form of a tabletop wooden witch's house surrounded by giant mushrooms. The reference is to Hansel and Gretel and their brush with disaster. But far from being spun from sugar and spice, this house looks sleek, design-savvy and expensive.</p>
        <p>More abstract, and maybe for that reason less interesting, is the show's main event, ''Money Heart,'' a heart-shaped floor piece composed of thousands of plastic coins glinting with reflected light. The work invites various readings. Might the coins be taken for trail markers dropped by the wandering Hansel and Gretel and swept together into a deceptively reassuring emblem of love? Could they be a collective symbol for Chelsea itself, the heart of an art world that is generating plenty of cash these days but has otherwise lost its way?</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, ''Money Heart'' doesn't have enough visual presence to make the answer to either question seem to matter much.</p>
