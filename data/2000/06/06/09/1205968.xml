        <p>Two years of war have caused the deaths of more than 1.7 million people in eastern Congo, where people who manage to flee the fighting often die of hunger and malaria while hiding in impenetrable forests, a leading refugee agency said today.</p>
        <p>This means that about four times as many people have died in the area since August 1998 as would be expected under normal conditions, according to a study released by the agency, the International Rescue Committee in New York.</p>
        <p>Although the expected death toll in the five-province area of 18 million people would be 600,000, the actual number was 2.3 million. Of the 1.7 million additional deaths reported in the survey, 200,000 were caused by acts of violence, whereas the rest were attributed to the war-related collapse of health services and food supplies.</p>
        <p>''Men with guns come and wreak havoc on a very regular basis,'' said Les Roberts, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins University, who supervised the study for the agency. ''Those men cause more death by making people flee their homes than actually by shooting or slitting throats.</p>
        <p>''People flee into the forest when a village is attacked, often at night. If they get a little sick and they are not eating, they often die. One girl told us how she fled her village at night with her family of eight. Five of the eight died as they hid in the forest.''</p>
        <p>The survey was conducted in April and May, with random samplings of houses in and around Moba, in Katanga Province; Kabare, Katana and Kolonge in South Kivu; and Kisangani in Orientale Province. Researchers asked residents questions like how many people were in the family, whether anyone had died since last Christmas, a major holiday among the many Roman Catholics in the region, and how many died last year.</p>
        <p>The Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, where Mr. Roberts formerly worked, provided baseline statistics for sub-Sahara Africa. The results from the region, with a population of 1.2 million, were extrapolated to the interior regions and neighboring provinces.</p>
        <p>''We have done what scientists hate to do, extrapolate from 1.2 million people to 18 million people,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''But have very consistently made conservative assumptions. I think we have protected ourselves from the criticisms that we are being extremists or hyperbolic.''</p>
        <p>When he finished his survey, Mr. Roberts asked the United Nations relief assistance coordinator for the area and a representative of the United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in the region to look over his findings. They thought that he might have been conservative, Mr. Roberts recounted.</p>
        <p>Everywhere he and his team found abandoned health clinics, local economies in shatters and families struggling without the subsistence agriculture or barter systems that had sustained them, he said. Children younger than 5, the study said, account for more than one-third of the excess deaths in eastern Congo, an area disrupted since 1994 by waves of ethnic and civil wars, sometimes indistinguishable from armed scrambles for gold and diamonds.</p>
        <p>Rwanda and Uganda sent troops into Congo, the former Zaire, in August 1998 in support of rebels opposed to the government of President Laurent Kabila. Last summer, Rwandan and Ugandan troops turned on each other, and they have been fighting each other this week around a diamond center, Kisangani, adding at least 50 additional civilian deaths to the toll.</p>
        <p>Today, Secretary General Kofi Annan spoke with Presidents Paul Kagame of Rwanda and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, and he was assured that a cease-fire, not the first in recent weeks, went into effect this afternoon. But hours later, Ugandan and Rwandan troops were fighting in Kisangani, Reuters reported.</p>
        <p>Jean-David Levitte, the French ambassador to the United Nations and the president of the Security Council this month, said the council members ''deplore the loss of life and the damage inflicted by the forces of Uganda and Rwanda on the Congolese population.''</p>
        <p>In the International Rescue Committee report, Kisangani had been found to be one of the brighter spots in an extremely bleak picture of life in one of Africa's potentially richest countries. The United Nations had hoped to make the city a neutral site where a large contingent of peacekeeping troops could be based and political negotiations begun to end the Congo war.</p>
        <p>The study found that eastern Congo has become ''an unchecked incubation zone for disease.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Roberts said malaria and diarrheal diseases, including cholera, appeared to be the leading causes of death, although meningitis and suspected cases of polio were also found.</p>
        <p>Because blood transfusions are often needed for malaria victims, he said, ''my strong gut feeling is that the prevalence of H.I.V. has increased.''</p>
        <p>H.I.V., which causes AIDS, and other deadly viruses are known to have flourished in Congo. ''Congo has something like the 14th highest death rate on the planet,'' Mr. Roberts said. Most of the other 13 countries are in sub-Sahara Africa.</p>
        <p>''There has been no blood tested in this region since 1998,'' he added.</p>
