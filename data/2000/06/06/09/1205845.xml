        <p>Camped on the banks of the Oswegatchie River deep in the Adirondacks several years ago, Paul Rezendes, a master tracker and wilderness photographer, was awakened by a black bear bashing around his camp. Naked and armed with only a canoe paddle, he chased the bear into the night. As he drifted back to sleep, the snorting bear returned, bent on sampling the contents of the well-stocked cooler that Mr. Rezendes had stashed at the far end of his camp.</p>
        <p>Now dressed, Mr. Rezendes -- a balding, bearded, 5-foot-8-inch 160-pounder -- stomped, growled and screamed at the lumbering bear like a crazed professional wrestler. Each time the bear raced off, it quickly returned, advancing each time. The standoff continued for hours until Mr. Rezendes packed up and paddled off into the foggy night without his precious cooler.</p>
        <p>''Spend enough time outdoors,'' Mr. Rezendes said as we drove along the Cold River outside the small town of Charlemont, Mass., ''and you learn total humility.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rezendes owns a school that offers day, weekend and weeklong courses in tracking and wilderness survival. I had arranged a one-day one-on-one intensive session with the master himself. My class began with a two-hour conversation in the front seat of the van where he sleeps when he is on the road. Parked next to an old logging path leading into the Mohawk Trail State Forest in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts, this 57-year-old former motorcycle-gang leader who barely made it through high school articulated his ideas about the nature of seeing and the interconnectedness of all living things.</p>
        <p>While his expertise would help any hunter stalk game, to Mr. Rezendes tracking is an inner journey to restore the senses. He is less interested in sighting the animal than in finding its signs and portents. ''Tracking is  an educational process,'' he said, leaning his head back and closing his  eyes. ''It opens the door to an animal's life, and to our own.''</p>
        <p>Standing at the trail head, Mr. Rezendes took a compass reading so that we could find our way out of the woods when we wandered off the trail, which he always does. ''Just because I don't know where I am half the time doesn't mean I'm lost,'' he said. ''All I need to know is how to get back to where we started.'' Pointing to a ridge highlighted on his topographical map, he said, ''The stand of beech trees we're headed to has some of the most concentrated bear signs I've ever found.''</p>
        <p>Less than five minutes down the trail Mr. Rezendes ran his fingers over the scarred, discolored bark on a tall red pine. ''Bear graffiti,'' he said, pointing out the scores of shoulder-high claw and teeth marks. Stopping to listen to the hollow hammering of a woodpecker, he said, ''Whether done by a street tough or a bear, most graffiti says the same thing: 'I am!' ''</p>
        <p>I wanted to see bear signs. I was less sure that I wanted to see an actual bear. Had we encountered one, however, Mr. Rezendes's piercing whistle was intended to send it scampering. I scanned the dense forest as if peering down a dark alley and inquired casually about the disposition of the hulking graffiti artists in these woods.</p>
        <p>Adjusting his camouflage baseball cap, Mr. Rezendes calmly explained that the black bears in these woods  had recently come out of hibernation. The mothers, who had lost a lot of weight holed up during the winter, were with their newborn cubs and were certainly hungry. ''A bear can smell you from a mile away, and a carcass from several miles,'' he said. ''Spring is a tough time for bears. There isn't a lot to eat.''</p>
        <p>Conscious of the pungent sandwiches in my backpack, I asked about the odds of meeting one of these swift, fast-climbing beasts. (Superior vision is the only physical advantage humans have over black bears. And I'm near-sighted.)</p>
        <p>''In the spring they tend to graze lower down, but you never know,'' he said, and smirked. ''I always tell students that the odds of seeing the animal we're tracking is low, but I'm often wrong.''</p>
        <p>Should one encounter a bear, however, the most important thing, Mr. Rezendes said, is to not run, a response that would activate its predatory instincts.</p>
        <p>Just before we turned off the trail, he stood over a loopy white and green mound. ''Female wild turkey,'' he said, ignoring the black flies swarming around his face. ''The male droppings look straighter, more phallic.''</p>
        <p>Well, of course.</p>
        <p>Nimbly ducking under branches and stepping over fallen logs, Mr. Rezendes was clearly someone who had spent a lot of time bushwhacking. I've logged countless hours hiking on backcountry trails, but this was a completely different experience. Following a well-marked trail, you are free to get lost in your  thoughts, checking in every now and then to admire the scenery. Off the trail, you are part of the scenery. You either pay attention or walk into an overhanging branch. Mr. Rezendes rarely knows where he's going in the forest. ''Once I begin tracking, I let the animal guide me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Embracing uncertainty is of great importance to Mr. Rezendes. ''The movement of an animal, of life, is constantly bringing us into the unknown,'' he said. In his book ''The Wild Within: Adventures in Nature and Animal Teachings,'' Mr. Rezendes describes how he and a group of students who had spent all day tracking a bobcat in the snow emerged into a clearing to find a deer's carcass stripped to the bone. Instantly the mood of the group changed from exuberance to revulsion. He used the kill site to make the point that even in death the deer  remained part of the web of life in the forest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rezendes's own life has been a series of transformations. As a child reared in the farm country of Westport, Mass., he and his younger brother spent countless hours with their mother, talking and walking and picking wild edible plants. When young Paul was not wandering the woods, he read everything he could find about American Indians. ''I idealized their culture,'' he said. ''Back then they were my role models.''</p>
        <p>But his path led from introspective child to violent leader of a feared motorcycle gang to a devoted Roman Catholic to a yogi living in an ashram. Think of Daniel Boone, Thomas Merton, Ewell Gibbons and Marlon Brando in ''The Wild One,'' and you begin to get a sense of the diverse influences that have informed Mr. Rezendes's life and work.</p>
        <p>Though I was born in Queens and was reared in the suburbs by parents who viewed sleeping under the stars as being strictly for escaped convicts, I have long been fascinated with surviving outside, especially under adverse conditions. While I did a fair amount of hiking and camping in my 20's, in my 30's I began going further, higher, harder: hiking, biking or paddling into the great outdoors, often by myself, carrying all I needed for as long as two months. I had powerful and memorable experiences, like being pinned down by wind for a week along Lake Oahe in North Dakota and traveling nine days through the badlands of Montana without seeing another soul.</p>
        <p>But the longer I listened and observed Mr. Rezendes on this sunny spring day, the more it seemed as if my wilderness trips had as much to do with my own drives and ambitions as they did with appreciating the places where I spent so much time. Walking with him was like touring a museum with a great art historian. Stopping frequently, he pointed out fine spring flowers (dwarf ginseng, spring beauties, trout lilies) and a deer hair stuck to a tree trunk.</p>
        <p>We passed a mushroom, and my guide told me how fields of mushrooms miles wide attached to the root system of trees, making them the largest living things on earth. We walked among stands of beech and hemlocks, some 300 years old, studying the claw marks of bears heading high into a tree's canopy and spotted  bear nests, large beds of branches high in trees. (And yes, we saw plenty of bear scat.)</p>
        <p>John Muir described observation  as reading ''the great alphabet of nature.'' Mr. Rezendes said tracking  involves specialized skills and knowledge, but first and foremost it requires patience: the ability to remain open to what the woods have to offer. For example, while walking along a lake he and a group of students came upon what appeared to be fresh tracks -- half circles about a foot long -- in the sand under tall drooping grass. ''What are these?'' he asked. The elaborate answers came in bunches. All were wrong.</p>
        <p>''Try silence, try observation,'' said the master tracker, who often meditates twice a day. Several minutes later, the group observed the wind sweep the long dry blades of grass across the sand, forming foot-long half-circles. Voila!</p>
        <p>After lunch we came to what Mr. Rezendes called a vernal pool, a bog the size of a studio apartment surrounded by a handful of towering hemlock and beech trees. It was shaded, profoundly still. And it had bear written all over it. The mauled, multilayered incisions in the bark said that this had once been a popular ursine hangout. Mr. Rezendes showed me a handful of young hemlocks with the tops snapped in half: whammy trees, he called them. ''These trees are very tough, but the bears go to great trouble to break them.''</p>
        <p>Why? I asked.</p>
        <p>He shrugged his shoulders. ''I could speculate, but I'm not sure.'' Mr. Rezendes says jumping to conclusions impedes learning. For example, it took him three years before he felt confident that a certain type of hole he often saw at the base of trees was made by porcupines looking for false truffles.</p>
        <p>With nowhere to go, no agenda and plenty of daylight left, we moved slowly from tree to tree like detectives investigating a crime scene. We came to no conclusions. We had no dramatic encounters with a half-starved bear. But it mattered not at all. We'd gathered information that bought us closer to the bear's life, to the life of the forest. I had tapped into that most basic part of nature, the need to stalk, a vestigial impulse in the modern world but one that had a strange resonance as we made our way through the woods.</p>
