        <p>Without fear or remorse, Reggie Miller fired shots until the bitter end Wednesday night, refusing to believe that they would not fall. Afterward, despite making an unfathomable 1-of-16 attempts, Miller issued a warning to the Los Angeles Lakers that was as outrageous as his performance.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't put the ball in the basket, first and foremost,'' Miller said today. ''But I tell you what, if they continue to give me those looks, they're going be in trouble. My first four baskets went in and out, and every shot but one felt good. If they're going to play me like that, it's only a matter of time.''</p>

        <p>Without fear or remorse, Reggie Miller fired shots until the bitter end Wednesday night, refusing to believe that they would not fall. Afterward, despite making an unfathomable 1-of-16 attempts, Miller issued a warning to the Los Angeles Lakers that was as outrageous as his performance.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't put the ball in the basket, first and foremost,'' Miller said today. ''But I tell you what, if they continue to give me those looks, they're going be in trouble. My first four baskets went in and out, and every shot but one felt good. If they're going to play me like that, it's only a matter of time.''</p>
        <p>Down one game to none in the National Basketball Association finals, the Indiana Pacers followed Miller's bravado today and suggested that the Lakers should be worried heading into Game 2 on Friday night. As blurry as their aim was in Game 1, the Pacers can't imagine their crosshairs being cloudy two games in a row.</p>
        <p>The Pacers clung onto several life-preserving moments from their 104-87 loss. They rallied from a 64-49 deficit to close within 77-71 through three quarters, before being outscored 27-16 in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Rik Smits was a nonfactor after picking up his fourth foul midway through the third quarter. And like Miller, Jalen Rose was swallowed whole by the Laker defense.</p>
        <p>Smits and Rose finished with 12 points each. But Mark Jackson and Austin Croshere kept the Pacers from being blown out of Staples Center. Jackson led a third-quarter rally and had 18 points, 7 assists and 5 rebounds. Croshere added 16 points.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Pacers figure things cannot possibly get worse, particularly their defense against the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal, whose 43 points and 19 rebounds, Indiana claims, will be proven an aberration.</p>
        <p>''It's not an easy series for us,'' Pacers Coach Larry Bird said. ''The matchups aren't good. They're a quick team. They're big with Shaq and strong. They're able to score points in bunches. But if we have the effort of Mark Jackson that we did last night, if Jalen picks his game up, if Reggie picks things up and Rik starts hitting a few shots, we'll be right there with the Lakers.''</p>
        <p>Bird's list of ifs included shooting at least 46 percent as a team. Despite Miller missing 15-of-16 attempts, the Pacers shot 42 percent Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''As crazy as it sounds,'' Jackson said, ''we feel good about where we are right now.''</p>
        <p>Miller especially looked on the bright side after his futility never wavered throughout Game 1. He was 0 of 6 in the first quarter, 0 of 1 in the second quarter, 1 of 5 in the third quarter and 0 of 4 in the fourth quarter. He missed each of his three 3-point attempts, made 5 of 5 free throws and finished with 7 points, 4 assists and 2 rebounds.</p>
        <p>''It can only get better,'' Miller said. ''I'm going to shoot my way out of it. I can't stop shooting. I feel bad I only got up 16 shots. If I was going to be 1 for 16, I at least should have been 1 for 25 or something like that. I really feel I didn't get enough looks.''</p>
        <p>Bird said: ''We don't give up on Reggie Miller. Next game, I hope he takes another 17 to 25 shots.''</p>
        <p>Miller estimated that 11 of his 16 shots were basically uncontested. The Lakers used the clever defense of the veteran Ron Harper and the youthful quickness of Kobe Bryant to keep Miller guessing, allowing him to drive and often funneling him toward the middle, where 7-foot-1-inch, 330-pound O'Neal menacingly waited.</p>
        <p>''I'll continue to attack the basket,'' Miller said. ''Shaq stands there and zones the middle, but if they're going to give me the baseline, I'll take it every time. You can't just settle for jump shots. You have to get to the free-throw line, especially in the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>Still, Miller downplayed being overexcited about making the N.B.A. finals for the first time in his 13-year career. He said he just needed to fuel an attitude toward the Lakers like the contempt he holds for the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''I don't have any bad feelings about L.A., but you need that extra motivation, you need to create that little something to get you ticked off,'' Miller said. ''I think I've created that myself by going 1 for 16 in Game 1 of my first ever N.B.A. finals. So, I'm more upset with myself now. I've got to contend with myself, which is kind of scary.''</p>
        <p>Bird said: ''He's never been here yet, so this is a new experience for him, a great experience. But he found out the hard way last night.''</p>
