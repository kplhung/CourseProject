        <p>MONTE CARLO is accustomed to rich and beautiful people. In late May, it was a backdrop for rich and beautiful cars, too, as three auction companies held events on the same weekend.</p>
        <p>Not since 1990, when the collector-car market was at a frenzied peak, have there been three consecutive auctions in Monaco. Brooks Europe, which was conducting its 10th annual Monaco auction, was joined by Barrett-Jackson, an American auction company, and Poulain Le Fur, a French auction house. It was Barrett-Jackson's first event outside its home base in Scottsdale, Ariz.; it teamed up with Coys of Kensington, based in London, to take advantage of the dollar's strength against European currencies (and American collectors' appetite for high-end European cars).</p>
        <p>The lavish Barrett/Coys event brought in $5.6 million, including buyers' premiums, with 30 cars sold of the 50 offered. Craig Jackson, owner of Barrett-Jackson, said, ''We brought the American bidders, and Coys brought the European merchandise.''</p>
        <p>Brooks Europe, with the most variety, sold 46 of the 72 cars offered for a total of $6.2 million. By presenting cars new to the market, Brooks got top-end prices. Poulain Le Fur, in partnership with Sotheby's, put on a smaller sale, bringing in $3.8 million.</p>
        <p>At all three auctions, rare Ferraris, especially those with racing histories, brought the highest bids.</p>
        <p>KEITH MARTIN</p>
        <p>1963 Ferrari SWB 250 GT California Spyder  $1,023,799 (Poulain Le Fur/Sotheby's)</p>
        <p>The 52nd of 54 such cars built, this one's history is known from the day it left the factory. Black, with a red leather interior, it is in excellent condition. The only car of its type on the market today, it could easily have brought another $100,000 without surprising the experts.</p>
        <p>1938 Mercedes-Benz 540K Cabriolet A  $787,538 (Poulain Le Fur/Sotheby's)</p>
        <p>In the United States since 1963 and fully restored in 1988, this supercharged Mercedes has won many concours prizes and has been driven fewer than 40,000 miles since new.</p>
        <p>1959 Ferrari 250 GT SWB Competizione  $907,340 (Barrett-Jackson/Coys)</p>
        <p>This alloy-body SWB was fully restored but fitted with a replacement engine. With the original, it could have been worth another $200,000.</p>
        <p>1956 Ferrari 250 GT ''Tour de France'' Competizione Berlinetta  $752,954 (Brooks Europe)</p>
        <p>An early-production TdF, it had been out of the market for 32 years, sitting in a Danish museum. It will require a total restoration but has the potential to be a distinctive prize-winning show car.</p>
        <p>1965 Ferrari 275 GTB Speciale  Competizione Berlinetta  $831,165 (Brooks Europe)</p>
        <p>1962 Maserati 5000 GT coupe  $330,077 (Brooks Europe)</p>
        <p>The price of this car, in nightmarish condition after 33 years in storage in Egypt -- it was seized after its owner, the exiled King Saud of Saudi Arabia, left the country -- was the surprise of the weekend. One of 32 built -- just one of two with a body by Frua, an Italian coachbuilder -- the car has been driven only 2,100 miles.</p>
