        <p>John Salley never a job that required him to employ an on-call chiropractor.</p>
        <p>During the Detroit Pistons' back-to-back championship teams in 1989-1990, Salley made good money and charmed everyone with his wit. He retired three years ago, relatively pain-free. A good life, he would go on to lead.</p>
        <p>But at age 36, Salley decided to become a reserve center for the Los Angeles Lakers, and for the past nine months, his job has been to defend Shaquille O'Neal in practice -- and then have his back and neck readjusted.</p>
        <p>''He's the richest chiropractor in California,'' Salley said.</p>
        <p>''I get dumped on by Shaq on a regular basis -- in the tailbone, in the ribs, in the shoulders. And if he can hit me -- and I'm his boy -- I feel sorry for anybody else.''</p>
        <p>If Salley is sore, the Indiana Pacers may be hurting worse after the devastation caused by O'Neal in Game 1 of the National Basketball Association finals.</p>
        <p>In spite of O'Neal's 43-point barrage leveled on the Pacers Wednesday, Indiana Coach Larry Bird has decided to stay with his defensive philosophy for Game 2 on Friday night, give or take a few double-teams. It is unclear why he has taken such a stand.</p>
        <p>Maybe Bird believes O'Neal can not keep up this pace over a seven-game series, a pace that would supplant Michael Jordan's 41-point average against the Phoenix Suns in 1993 -- the highest in N.B.A. finals history.</p>
        <p>It could be Bird is trying to challenge Rik Smits, Dale Davis, Sam Perkins and every other overmatched soul who tried to guard O'Neal in Game 1, the notion that the Pacers can't possibly play any worse. Or maybe he has a more obvious reason: He can't stop O'Neal.</p>
        <p>As the Lakers' 7-foot-1-inch, 330-pound center grows larger and more dominant, perhaps no one can.</p>
        <p>A long-time acquaintance of Bird ribbed the Pacers' coach yesterday after Indiana practice.</p>
        <p>''Nice strategy on Shaq,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Bird's reply: ''He didn't get 50, did he?''</p>
        <p>The frightening aspect of O'Neal's performance Wednesday night -- the idea that it could get worse before it gets better for Indiana -- was that it was less forceful than it was diverse, shots coming from all angles and distances within 12 feet.</p>
        <p>There were jump hooks spliced in with close-range jump shots, spin-to-the-rim layups mixed in with alley-oop dunks. He unveiled a pretty baseline jumper in the first half.</p>
        <p>Twenty-one field goals, one more than Indiana's starting five. As the repertory keeps expanding, the class of elite centers keep shrinking.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if there's a stronger big man I've ever seen or coached against,'' said Dick Harter, the 68-year-old Pacers' assistant coach. ''His strength is amazing.</p>
        <p>''He's added a little Texas two-step in there and that makes him hard to defend. And when he brings his knapsack and sleeping bag, you wonder how long he's going to stay in the lane.''</p>
        <p>The Pacers have not stooped to employing the Hack-a-Shaq plan yet. It is a rather juvenile defensive scheme, employed by desperate coaches whose own players do not work hard enough and therefore feel like they need to intentionally foul O'Neal so he does not dunk them into the Earth.</p>
        <p>''There's a scenario there,'' Harter said. ''But that's not our game plan. Right now, it's not.''</p>
        <p>In their quest to become more young and athletic, the Pacers shipped Antonio Davis, the brawny power forward, to Toronto for the fifth pick in the draft last June -- corn-silk thin, 18-year-old Jonathan Bender. Not that Davis would have helped.</p>
        <p>''With Shaq's power base, I think you need a Ricky Mahorn-style power base,'' Harter said. ''He might tower over Ricky Mahorn and throw him out of there.</p>
        <p>''He's a big man version of a Larry Bird-Bernard King-Kevin McHale forward,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Harter was asked if the Lakers' triangle offense was confounding the Pacers, the same offense Lakers Coach Phil Jackson ran in Chicago.</p>
        <p>''Michael Jordan and Shaq are the obstacles,'' he said. ''The triangle is a very excellent offense, but the triangle is not beating us. Shaq is beating us.''</p>
        <p>Perkins, who has played in three finals, said: ''I don't know what it's like to play against Chamberlain and them, but this guy is a dominant center, for sure.''</p>
        <p>Only Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar have won a scoring title, a regular-season most valuable player award and an N.B.A. title in the same season. Jordan accomplished the feat four times.</p>
        <p>Early in his career, Jordan was known to test the bodies and minds of overmatched teammates in practice, running the Bulls ragged as he worked his game, dreamed his dream and hope the two would one day fuse together.</p>
        <p>O'Neal is doing the same thing today, mowing over poor John Salley and the Pacers as he motors toward his first championship. ''I can't feel sorry those guys,'' Salley said. ''I'm the one with scoleoscis.''</p>
