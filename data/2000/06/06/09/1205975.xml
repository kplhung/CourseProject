        <p>Editorial lauds Senate passage of legislation that would require certain political 'slush funds' that are raising unregulated money to dislose donors; calls on House to stand up to Repr Tom DeLay and pass similar measure</p>

        <p>The 1996 Democratic fund-raising scandals introduced the notorious phrase ''soft money'' into everyday political discourse. The term applies to the huge, corrupting sums raised from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals for political parties outside federal limits. This year another gross abuse is spreading. Slush funds created under Section 527 of the tax code are starting to raise unregulated money without actually disclosing the donors. Yesterday evening, in a surprise victory for reform, the Senate voted for an amendment to close this new loophole and require disclosure. The measure still needs final Senate approval, and also passage by the House.</p>
        <p>Section 527 has been discovered by tax experts this year as a way to let groups involved in political issues raise money from donors who escape gift taxes. These groups can spend unlimited amounts from anonymous sources as long as the money does not go for ads that advocate voting for or against a candidate. In the last election cycles, the Republican and Democratic parties both raised soft money to bypass restrictions on spending by candidates. But at least the donors of soft money had to be made public.</p>
        <p>The new loophole has led Representative Tom DeLay and others to set up shadowy fund-raising units. Mr. DeLay has opposed disclosure for these Section 527 groups even though, in other legislative contexts, he has said he preferred disclosure to actual curbs on fund-raising. Yesterday many senators who have opposed other kinds of campaign reform delivered a surprising vote in favor of disclosure to penetrate the secrecy around Section 527 fund-raising. The measure was sponsored by Senator John McCain and two Democrats, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin. They argued that their bill was evenhanded because it applied to groups raising money from both Democrats and Republicans.</p>
        <p>The best-known recent case of a Section 527 group sponsoring political ads occurred in March, when an organization called Republicans for Clean Air ran attack ads against Senator McCain in New York and other states. It turned out, to no one's great surprise, that this group had been set up by a contributor to and crony of Gov. George W. Bush.  Some supporters of Mr. Bush have also formed a group called Shape the Debate and run ads attacking Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Gore used their ads as an excuse to authorize the Democratic Party to run its own soft-money ads, despite his earlier pledge to wait until the Republican Party started running its own soft-money ads.</p>
        <p>With the victory yesterday, there is an excellent chance that a version of the same measure will pass in the House. Many self-described reformers who have voted for a soft-money ban in the past should be prepared to back it today. These include Representatives Rick Lazio of New York and Bob Franks of New Jersey, who are using their past support of campaign reform as selling points in their Senate races. Almost all Democrats favor the measure. There should be enough courageous Republicans to defy Mr. DeLay and stand up for the principles they say they espouse.</p>
