        <p>''The miners had a saying: 'If the timbers start talking, we start walking,' '' Joe Burke said, turning his head so that the thin beam from the lamp on his miner's helmet poked into the gloom, barely illuminating the stout wood columns that seemed to hold up the roof.</p>

''Their real job was to let miners know if there was what they called a squeeze -- pressure or movement in the rock above.

        <p>''The miners had a saying: 'If the timbers start talking, we start walking,' '' Joe Burke said, turning his head so that the thin beam from the lamp on his miner's helmet poked into the gloom, barely illuminating the stout wood columns that seemed to hold up the roof.</p>
        <p>These timbers don't really support the mine roof, explained Mr. Burke. It is held up by pillars of stone that miners leave standing as they dig out adjoining chambers of coal. ''You could actually remove all of these timber props, and the roof would stay the way it is,'' he said. ''Their real job was to let miners know if there was what they called a squeeze -- pressure or movement in the rock above. That would make these timbers creak and even crack, which was basically an early warning system to get out fast.''</p>
        <p>Guiding visitors along a damp and chilly tunnel in the old Lackawanna Coal Mine, 300 feet under the ground, Mr. Burke does not give the company line on the history of King Coal. Coal mining was brutish, backbreaking and sometimes fatal for those who went down into the mines. In Pennsylvania's anthracite mines, 600 to 700 men died annually in each of the 15 years of heaviest production until the end of World War I. In all, more than 30,000 workers died in accidents in the anthracite mines from 1870 to 1949, after which production fell off sharply.</p>
        <p>The hundreds of visitors who take the guided tours of the mine every day are meant to come back into the sunshine with a greater appreciation of a way of life that left deep veins of loss, misery and cultural trauma through successive generations of families in the anthracite fields of northeast Pennsylvania, where thick fingers of hard-coal deposits are splayed for 450 miles between the folds of rolling mountains.</p>
        <p>Only fairly recently have memories of mining history become cultural imprints to celebrate rather than bitterly suppress. ''Mining left a mark on many families around here,'' said Tom Supey Jr., the foreman of the restored coal mine, which is operated by Lackawanna County. ''A lot of people were killed or watched their loved ones die of black lung disease, so coal mining was kind of something they wanted to forget about.''</p>
        <p>The American labor movement was born here, starting with the first miners' strikes in the 1840's. Coal companies and the railroads that hauled coal often deployed armed thugs to respond to labor agitation. Like early SWAT teams, squads of brutal Pinkerton private detectives, as well as the hated Coal and Iron Police, were rushed by railroad cars to sites of labor unrest. On the miners' side, the night-riding Molly Maguires, a secret society whose members had fled the Irish famine in the late 1840's, rallied miners and exacted violent retribution against many abusive mine bosses in a struggle of class warfare that was forged into American labor legend.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, worried that the turbulent history of the coal fields might be forgotten as its culture faded, Mr. Supey and his brother, Andy, joined with their father, Tom Sr., to lead fund-raising efforts for restoration of the mine, whose 1,300-foot main shaft had deteriorated over the years since it was shut down in 1966. The goal was to reopen the Lackawanna mine as a way to commemorate a critical American industrial experience whose narrative, they feared, would otherwise literally die on the lips of the last generation of men who had gone down daily into the mines.</p>
        <p>The mine, which remains structurally sound, was reopened in 1985, when the idea of luring tourists to a drab, played-out upstate Pennsylvania city like Scranton was considered eccentric at best. The regional tourist business increased substantially after the opening in 1995 of Steamtown National Historic Site, where one of the country's largest collections of steam locomotives and steam-era rolling stock are gathered in a 52-acre former rail yard only a few miles from the mine.</p>
        <p>Like Steamtown, whose train-buff visitors often spill over to the Lackawanna site and the adjacent state-run Anthracite Heritage Museum, the mine tour emphasizes the real thing. ''You get the dampness, you get the cold, you get a first-hand look at what mining was like,'' Mr. Supey said.</p>
        <p>You also get guides like Joe Burke -- affable, knowledgeable and deeply cognizant of his family roots in the coal fields. Though Mr. Burke wasn't a miner, his father hauled those roof timbers down into the mines. A great-grandfather started out as a ''breaker boy,'' one of many child laborers, whose job was to pick out slate rocks and sort chunks of coal that rumbled in an endless stream along troughs in a breaker shed where giant machines crunched the newly mined coal. The miserable plight of breaker boys inspired Gilded Age journalists to loud denunciations of coal-mine exploitation and led to passage of stronger child labor laws.</p>
        <p>The Lackawanna site was one of about 200 mines that once operated in the northeastern Pennsylvania coal fields. Their product, anthracite, is a hard, clean-burning coal that first fueled the small factories,  steam engines and iron furnaces of the 19th-century Industrial Revolution; the ruins of four such structures from this era can be seen at the Scranton Iron Furnaces. Later, soft bituminous coal from West Virginia and Kentucky fed the blast furnaces that turned Pittsburgh, 300 miles to the west, into the steel-making capital of the nation.</p>
        <p>But the demand for anthracite continued to grow in the 20th century, when it was the primary home-heating fuel for the burgeoning cities of the Northeast. The anthracite market declined and the mines began closing only when oil and gas heat displaced hard coal as the dominant home-heating fuel starting in the late 1950's.</p>
        <p>The tour takes about an hour and starts at a loading platform that faces the old tipple, the area where coal cars were unloaded and their cargo dumped into the troughs to be crushed and sorted in the breaker shed. Tour visitors climb onto bench seats in a steel-gated mine car that slowly descends deep into the earth on a 25-degree slope. At the bottom they exit beside a wooden shack in the dimly lit, cool subterranean gangway, a central transportation tunnel that stretches into the darkness. The tunnel is intersected regularly by dim chambers that probe at upward angles through layers of rock and sandstone into thick veins of anthracite, natural seams of coal that radiate for 30 miles into the hills on either side of the mine.</p>
        <p>Besides the constant 58-degree chill and the gloom, the ghostly echo of water drops splashing on unseen rocks was a constant companion on the walking tour into the depths of the mine. At the start, Mr. Burke encouraged taller visitors to put on one of the hard hats on a shelf.</p>
        <p>Not that there appears to be any actual danger. In the spring, when the mine reopens for the season, hundreds of schoolchildren are escorted on daily tour groups, their voices echoing off distant rock walls. The lighting is adequate to see the pathway in the various chambers, where thick veins of anthracite appear as shiny black wainscoting.</p>
        <p>In one dim, echoing chamber, Mr. Burke showed how miners extracted the coal from veins that curl through layers of rock pushed up by the primordial forces that made mountains where an inland sea once lay. Unlike the more plentiful soft bituminous coal that is produced to the west and south into the Appalachians, anthracite doesn't yield readily to a pick. Explosives are required.</p>
        <p>A miner needed to drill a hole into the coal face to insert a dynamite packing. Mr. Burke demonstrated a hand-cranked drill that required the brute force of three men to do the job. Then, grunting, he hoisted up a big, clumsy electric drill that was in use through the 1930's. Drill bits could be as long as eight feet, he explained.</p>
        <p>''This is no Black and Decker; it's about 50 pounds,'' Mr. Burke said as he leaned into the tool. ''It's got an electric cord, which can be pretty dangerous if you were ankle deep in water. Also, if you're drilling into the coal and you should hit shale, what the miners called bone, that drill bit could seize up and the handle could turn into a propeller and rip into your shoulder or your jaw.'' The tool, which was replaced in the late 30's by a safer compressed-air drill, also threw off sparks, with potentially lethal results in a mine chamber where methane gas might have built up.</p>
        <p>Once the dynamite was tamped in, miners retreated far down the chamber. Mr. Burke had his tour group join him in a thundering recitation of the miner's bellowed warning of an imminent blast: ''Fire! Fire! Fire in the hole!'' Then he flicked a switch activating a loudspeaker that sent a deep, ominous rumble echoing through the chamber.</p>
        <p>There are other small theatrical touches on the tour. Children who gather to look into a narrow, dark tunnel shriek when a rubber mechanical hand meant to represent a buried miner begins clawing at the rubble. Here and there in the darkened caverns, lifelike mannequins of miners, including children, can be seen bent to the grueling work.</p>
        <p>One of them shows a ''mule boy,'' perhaps 12 years old, working beside one of the tens of thousands of mules that used to live in the mines, hoisting the heavy coal trucks up to the surface, before they were replaced by small locomotive cars. A mule boy's job, performed in near darkness, was to tend the beasts and stop runaway coal carts on a track by using a wooden pole called a sprag.</p>
        <p>''If that coal cart started rolling, the mule boy, well he'd just have to get down under the cart and force that sprag between the spokes,'' said Mr. Burke, who scrambled under the cart to show how it was done.</p>
        <p>Dangerous work for a child? ''Well, a good mule was considered to be a lot harder to replace than a boy,'' Mr. Burke said.</p>
        <p>Around another rocky bend, visitors come upon a wooden ''peg shanty,'' a ramshackle underground office run by the so-called fire boss,  whose main jobs were to ensure against gas-explosion hazards and to account for all miners at the end of a shift. On a board hanging beside the shack, miners would insert wooden pegs with their names on them. The pegs are still hanging there.</p>
        <p>A little farther on, we pass into a windy 30-foot-long air ventilation chamber shut off at either end by big steel doors that enabled miners to direct the flow of fresh air from giant steam fans on the surface down into various chambers. A figure of another child crouches on a crude stool beside one of these doors. ''That boy was called the nipper,'' said Mr. Burke. In the era before child labor laws, this boy's job was to open and close the doors to prevent fresh air from going where it wasn't needed.</p>
        <p>The tour ends at the foot of a long cavern, where a hulking, dusty coal locomotive stands on the tracks. Nearby, a long steel trough descends from the last dig that was made into ''belly veins'' where miners had to crawl through small tunnels to claw away boulders of coal, usually mixed with other rocks, which then thundered down the chute to be loaded into the coal car for transportation to the tipple at the surface. There, in the roaring din of the breaker house, the coal would be broken into smaller chunks and sorted by hand.</p>
        <p>''There's our vein,'' said Mr. Burke. ''What we're looking at is millions of years of the earth's history right here. We're also looking at the place where work stopped when the mine closed in 1966. The last day of work was right here.''</p>
        <p>He flicked a switch that suddenly plunged the chamber into impenetrable darkness. Then he gradually adjusted his light, first to show the pathetically weak illumination of a coal-oil lamp that would have been used in the early days of the mines, and then to show the only marginally more intense beam of a later-day coal-miner's helmet lamp. Finally, the lights came back up, and we made our way along the gangway to the work shack at the base of the shaft to wait for the cable car that would haul us to the surface.</p>
        <p>The group on Mr. Burke's tour had been unusually small -- only three of us, all adult men. At the end of the tour, the guides usually hand out souvenir ''miner's certificates,'' replicas of the actual state certificates that licensed miners to use explosives and were a coal miner's most coveted possession. But none of us wanted to take a replica miner's certificate. Thanks to Mr. Burke's efforts, we had gotten some small idea of what a real one used to cost.</p>
        <p>Tours and Trains</p>

        <p>MINING AND MOLLY MAGUIRE HISTORY. Old Jail Museum, 128 West Broadway, Jim Thorpe, Pa., (570) 325-5259. Those interested in pursuing Pennsylvania coal-mine culture can visit the Old Jail Museum and other historic sites in Jim Thorpe, 57 miles south of Scranton. The town, rich in mining and railroading history, changed its name from Mauch Chunk in the mid-1950's to play down its history in coal and instead honor Jim Thorpe, an American Indian from Oklahoma who was a 1912 Olympic champion. (In his lifetime, Thorpe had no connection to Mauch Chunk but was buried there after his widow persuaded the town to adopt his name as a promotional ploy.) In 1877 and 1878, the last seven members of 22 alleged Molly Maguires who were condemned to death after a spate of labor violence were hanged at the former Carbon County Jail. The gallows has been restored, and the museum features historical displays on the Molly Maguires. The museum and jail are open daily except Wednesdays from noon to 4:30 p.m. Admission: $4 for adults; $3.50 for the elderly and students with ID; $2.50 for children 6 to 12.</p>
