        <p>CLARK-Blair. The Hunter College community is deeply saddened by the passing of Blair Clark, Trustee of The Hunter College Foundation, a member of the Brookdale Board of Overseers and a friend of the College. He served as Co-Chair of The Committee for the Restoration of Roosevelt House and was deeply committed to its renewal. Mr. Clark was a retired journalist whose career spanned four decades. He was General Manager and Vice President for CBS News, France and New York, and editor of ''The Nation.'' We are proud of our association with Mr. Clark and shall miss him deeply. Our sincerest condolences are extended to his wife, children, and the entire family. David A. Caputo, President Hunter College CLARK-Blair. The Trustees of The Hunter College Foundation and members of The Committee for the Restoration of Roosevelt House are deeply saddened by the passing of their friend and fellow Trustee, Blair Clark. The restoration of Roosevelt House was a project close to his heart. He was an avid supporter of its renewal as a living tribute to the legacy of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt in New York City, and its place in Hunter's history. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife and family. Allan H. Kurtzman, Chairman Hunter College Foundation CLARK-L. Blair. The Club salutes its Senior Member L. Blair Clark, champion of the young, raconteur extraordinaire and splendid friend. Like his son Cameron, he was a virtuous man who passed ''mildy away''. Ours was no ''dull, sublunary lovers' love.'' Charles Kaiser, David White, Heyden White Rostow, And special guest Nancy B. Hector</p>
