        <p>HARTFORD: NEW CHILD ADVOCATE  Gov. John G. Rowland appointed Jeanne Milstein, left, of East Hartford to the Office of Child Advocate yesterday, replacing Linda Pearce Prestley, who resigned to become a Superior Court judge. The child advocate investigates complaints of abuse, makes legislative recommendations, and works with state agencies to oversee the care and protection of children in Connecticut. Ms. Milstein previously served as a senior official with the Department of Children and Families and the Connecticut Commission on Children.  Theresa Crapanzano (NYT)</p>
        <p>GREENWICH: BEACH APPEAL  An appeals court erred when it ruled that Greenwich's beaches must be open to all state residents, Greenwich lawyers contended in a request to have the case heard by the State Supreme Court. Greenwich has allowed out-of-towners on the beaches only if they are accompanied by a resident. But a state appellate court ruled last month that the policy violated the public trust doctrine, which provides that municipalities hold parks and beaches in trust for all state residents. Greenwich argues that the doctrine does not apply to its particular case.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: WORKFARE AGREEMENT  The Giuliani administration has agreed to hire 27 additional carpenters and painters to settle a lawsuit that accused the city of using workfare laborers to replace city employees. The city did not admit wrongdoing in settling the lawsuit, which was brought by the unions representing the municipal workers. The city was accused of cutting the roster of Parks Department painters to 2 from 30 a decade ago. State law bars cities from using workfare workers to replace regular employees or to do their work.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: UNION MONITOR  The national leadership of the Transport Workers Union of America has named a financial monitor to oversee day-to-day financial operations at Local 100, which represents 33,000 New York City transit workers. The parent union acted after the local removed a vice president because she had used a union credit card to improperly charge meals and concert tickets. The parent union, noting other allegations of financial impropriety at Local 100, also said it would hire an independent accounting firm to audit the local's books.</p>

        <p>NORTH HEMPSTEAD: ENVIRONMENTAL FUND  North Hempstead officials will hold a public forum on Tuesday to discuss the creation of an environmental fund financed by a tax increase. Officials of the town say a building boom is threatening open space and polluting waterways. Officials want to provide the proposed Environmental Legacy Fund with $15 million to buy land and restore environmentally sensitive areas and waterways. An initial town vote on the measure is scheduled for Sept. 19.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: ASSAULT, THEN A FATAL JUMP  After stabbing a woman numerous times last night in upper Manhattan, a man jumped to his death from a fourth-floor window of the apartment where the attack took place, the police said. The woman was in critical condition at Harlem Hospital, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman. The attack occurred around 10:30 p.m. in an apartment at 690 Academy Street in the Inwood section, Detective Pentangelo said. He added that the man knew the woman but that their relationship was unclear. The names of the two people were not released.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: GORMLEY CONCEDES  State Senator William L. Gormley, left, has made it official, conceding that United States Representative Bob Franks is the winner of Tuesday's primary for the Republican nomination for Senate. Mr. Gormley held off conceding for two days, although Mr. Franks declared victory on Election Night and spent Wednesday campaigning as he began his race against the Democratic primary winner, Jon S. Corzine. The latest tally gave Mr. Franks a 3,700-vote margin out of more than 270,000 votes cast.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: AUTO TEST DELAY  The Environmental Protection Agency allowed the state to extend a deadline for imposing stricter auto emissions tests at some public testing centers this week, prompting a suit by private service-station owners who say the move hurts them. On Monday, the E.P.A. agreed to a 30-day extension of the June 30 deadline the state faces at 7 of its 30 testing centers, where officials say more time is needed to hire additional technicians. On Wednesday, the New Jersey Gasoline Retailers Association filed a suit in Federal District Court to block the extension. The group's president, William Dressler, said his members would lose money as long as state testing centers offered the less-stringent test, which he said is preferred by many motorists.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: PATIENTS' RIGHTS  A group of health professionals and others met yesterday to support legislation giving patients the right to sue H.M.O.'s accused of denying medically necessary care. The group included representatives from the Academy of Pediatricians and the State Nurses Association as well as retirees and consumer advocates.</p>

        <p>JACKSON TOWNSHIP: TIGER RULING  The ''Tiger Lady'' of Ocean County, Joan Byron-Marasek, lost another round yesterday in her fight to hold on to her 26 tigers. The commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Protection, Robert C. Shinn, issued an opinion concurring with an administrative law judge who had ruled in April that Ms. Byron-Marasek's license to keep tigers should be revoked. The state allows people to keep wild or exotic animals only for theatrical or educational purposes, and Mr. Shinn agreed with the judge, John R. Tassini, that Ms. Byron-Marasek kept her tigers as pets, and under poor conditions. Ms. Byron-Marasek came under scrutiny in January 1999 when a 431-pound tiger wandering loose in the area was killed by the police after they were unable to sedate it with tranquilizer darts. The state believes the tiger was Ms. Byron-Marasek's, an allegation she denies.</p>
