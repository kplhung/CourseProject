        <p>John Edward Robinson Sr., 56, was a quiet man who mowed his grass three times a week and grilled the hamburgers at a neighborhood cookout two weeks ago. But the police say he had a second life as well, using the Internet to lure women into violence.</p>
        <p>Last week, the police arrested Mr. Robinson after two women said that they had met him in local hotels for sadomasochistic sex but that the man who called himself Slavemaster assaulted and robbed them. The arrest took place Friday, and then over the weekend, the police began to make a series of grisly discoveries.</p>
        <p>A search of a farm Mr. Robinson owns in La Cygne, Kan., 57 miles south of Kansas City, yielded two barrels sitting outdoors, swathed in plastic. Inside were the bodies of two women. A second search, of three storage units Mr. Robinson rented in nearby Raymore, Mo., 54 miles northeast, yielded three more 55-gallon drums and three more bodies.</p>
        <p>Only one of the women, Suzette Marie Trouten, 28, of Monroe County, Mich., has been identified. The authorities say Ms. Trouten met Mr. Robinson on the Internet, although they declined to discuss the nature of the site. And as the investigation widens, the police have linked Mr. Robinson to four other women and a baby who have also disappeared.</p>
        <p>Paul J. Morrison, the Johnson County district attorney who filed the assault charges against Mr. Robinson on Friday, is now leading a two-state task force investigating the case. Mr. Morrison said he expected to file more charges against Mr. Robinson, who was being held on a $5 million bond.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson's lawyer, Byron Cerrillo, said his client would plead not guilty to the sexual assault charges and to any murder charges that might be filed.</p>
        <p>''I resent the fact that people are now claiming that Mr. Robinson, either directly or indirectly, is a serial killer,'' Mr. Cerrillo said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson and his wife, Nancy, live in a mobile home park in Olathe, about 37 miles from the farm where the first bodies were discovered.</p>
        <p>Detective David Brown, the Lenexa, Kan., police officer acting as a spokesman for the task force, said the police had been investigating Mr. Robinson's connection to Ms. Trouten when they received the assault complaints.</p>
        <p>Detective Brown, who has been investigating computer crimes for several years, said the case underscored the importance of caution when meeting people through the Internet.</p>
        <p>Sharon LaPrad, owner of LaPrad Home Care in Monroe, Mich., 35 miles south of Detroit, had employed Ms. Trouten for much of the past decade as a nurse's aide working in the homes of dying and convalescing patients.</p>
        <p>Ms. LaPrad said her employee had been contacted last year through an Internet chat room by a man who offered her a job. Ms. Trouten was lured to her death by promises of a $62,000-a-year job as nurse and companion for her supposed patron's ''elderly father,'' Ms. LaPrad said.</p>
        <p>The job, Ms. Trouten was told, would last about a year and offered world travel, a month off after every two months of traveling, plus all expenses and extensive health and other benefits. The money, she thought, would pay for her dream -- to train to become a licensed practical nurse and eventually a registered nurse.</p>
        <p>Ms. Trouten made two trips to Kansas, in October and November, to look into the job and her prospective employer, and she returned impressed with what she saw, Ms. LaPrad said.</p>
        <p>''He picked her up at the airport in a limousine,'' Ms. LaPrad recalled in a telephone interview. ''She told me he lived in a mansion. She said she saw the mansion and a guest house. She said it was something else. The man had a lot of money.''</p>
        <p>They were going to travel for a couple of months, she told her friends, and then she would have a month off.</p>
        <p>Ms. LaPrad said she was skeptical, as were other friends of Ms. Trouten's. ''It sounded too good to be true,'' Ms. LaPrad said. ''But she was so confident. 'This is on the up and up,' she said.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Trouten related that she had received and signed a contract for the job.</p>
        <p>Ms. Trouten told Ms. LaPrad that it was not a permanent arrangement. ''Her last words to me summed it up,'' Ms. LaPrad said. ''She put her arm around me and I wished her luck and she said, 'This is only going to be for a year. It's not forever. I'll be back and forth. I'll see you in a couple of months.' ''</p>
        <p>In February, Ms. Trouten, who was single and had no children, left the Newport, Mich., home she shared with her mother, Carolyn, took her two Pekingese dogs and drove to Kansas. On Feb. 27, Ms. LaPrad said, she received an e-mail message from Ms. Trouten saying she had arrived after a 14-hour drive.</p>
        <p>A day later, Ms. Trouten's mother received an e-mail message from her daughter saying she had checked into a motel. A few days later, Carolyn Trouten received another e-mail message, this one from the man who had supposedly employed her. It said that Ms. Trouten would be gone for about two months, and it gave an itinerary that did not provide details.</p>
        <p>The mother became suspicious and called the police, Ms. LaPrad said. On Wednesday, the authorities released the names and, in some cases, photos of four missing women and one missing baby whose disappearances, they said, might be linked to Mr. Robinson. They were: Paula Godfrey, 19, reported missing on Sept. 1, 1984; Katherine Clampet, 27, reported missing June 5, 1987; Izabela K. Lewicka, 22, a Polish immigrant who has been missing since last fall; and Lisa Stasi, 19, who disappeared with her 5-month-old baby, Tiffany, on Jan. 11, 1985. All of the women were living or staying in Overland Park, Kan., at the time they vanished.</p>
        <p>Citing investigators' reports from 1985, The Kansas City Star said Ms. Stasi was staying in a domestic violence shelter at the time she met Mr. Robinson. The newspaper reported that the police believed Mr. Robinson promised to help her go to Texas to train for work as a silk-screen printer. He also offered her $800 a month for living expenses and promised to find her a baby-sitter.</p>
        <p>Later, according to the newspaper, a lawyer representing Mr. Robinson told the police that Ms. Stasi had decided to take care of herself, and Mr. Robinson told the police she had moved to Denver.</p>
        <p>The police would not disclose details of the earlier investigations or provide information about Ms. Godfrey, Ms. Clampet, or Ms. Lewicka.</p>
        <p>At Store-Mor For Less in Raymore, Mo., where the police found three bodies in Mr. Robinson's 10-by-15-foot unit, a manager who asked that her name not be used said the Robinsons rented three units in 1993.</p>
        <p>Nancy Robinson rented the first storage unit in May, 1993, and Mr. Robinson rented two more units in November or December, 1993, the manager said.</p>
        <p>''He told me his sister Beverly had gone to work for his company, Equi II, and he was storing her furniture. She supposedly had gone to Australia. The last time I saw him, he was saying that she was in Italy. He said, 'She's having a ball. I don't think she'll ever return.' ''</p>
        <p>The manager said Mr. Robinson had paid his rent on time, often in person. ''He would run through here -- I guess to check on his bones,'' she said. ''Lately he's been sending his check in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson has a lengthy criminal record of theft and fraud. He was sent to prison in Kansas in May, 1986. In 1991, he was paroled and sent to Missouri to serve a sentence for theft. He was paroled there in March, 1993. He then moved to Olathe, where his wife manages the mobile home park.</p>
        <p>Henry Timmons, 79, the Robinsons' next-door neighbor, recalled that Mr. Robinson ''kept his yard immaculate. He had elaborate decorations on all the holidays -- Christmas, Halloween, Easter.''</p>
        <p>''I assumed he was retired,'' Mr. Timmons said. ''He looks older than he is. They had grown children and at least one grandchild. There was a sign outside that said 'Grandpa's place. We Spoil Grandchildren.' They were cordial, but they were always in a hurry.''</p>
