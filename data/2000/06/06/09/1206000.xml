      <abstract>
        <p>John Dennehy, IRS agent, is cross-examined in tax-fraud trial of Albert J Pirro Jr, real estate developer in Westchester County, and he acknowledges that only 2.8 percent of the $13,034,193 in deductions taken by Pirro's myriad companies between 1988 and 1997 were actually deemed improper; says, however, that smallness of percentage does not mitigate the fact that Pirro personally and disproportionately benefited from his company's deductions, time and again, by failing to declare company purchases like a $123,000 Ferrari (M)</p>

        <p>Giving some credence to the argument that the government may have been overzealous in its prosecution of Albert J. Pirro Jr. on tax fraud charges, an agent for the Internal Revenue Service acknowledged today that only a small fraction of the deductions taken by Mr. Pirro's myriad companies were actually deemed improper.</p>
        <p>Between 1988 and 1997, Mr. Pirro's companies improperly deducted $364,617 out of $13,034,193 in total deductions -- or 2.8 percent, said the agent, John Dennehy. But during cross-examination by Robert J. Giuffra Jr., one of Mr. Pirro's lawyers, Mr. Dennehy tried to remind jurors that such a small percentage did not convey the big picture: namely, that Mr. Pirro personally and disproportionately benefited from his company's deductions, time and again, by failing to declare company purchases like a $123,000 Ferrari.</p>

        <p>Giving some credence to the argument that the government may have been overzealous in its prosecution of Albert J. Pirro Jr. on tax fraud charges, an agent for the Internal Revenue Service acknowledged today that only a small fraction of the deductions taken by Mr. Pirro's myriad companies were actually deemed improper.</p>
        <p>Between 1988 and 1997, Mr. Pirro's companies improperly deducted $364,617 out of $13,034,193 in total deductions -- or 2.8 percent, said the agent, John Dennehy. But during cross-examination by Robert J. Giuffra Jr., one of Mr. Pirro's lawyers, Mr. Dennehy tried to remind jurors that such a small percentage did not convey the big picture: namely, that Mr. Pirro personally and disproportionately benefited from his company's deductions, time and again, by failing to declare company purchases like a $123,000 Ferrari.</p>
        <p>In a way, today's testimony represented a battle over context as much as content as Mr. Dennehy took the witness stand for the fourth consecutive day in the three-week-old trial of Mr. Pirro, the husband of Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, and his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro. Together, the two brothers are accused of improperly deducting more than $1.2 million of Albert Pirro's personal and sometimes lavish expenses as business write-offs.</p>
        <p>For prosecutors, the trial strategy to date has been to offer a disciplined and meticulous account of Mr. Pirro's expenses, and to try to demonstrate that the brothers knew -- as evidenced by thousands of invoices, checks and other documents -- that what they were doing was illegal.</p>
        <p>The defense lawyers' strategy appears to be to portray the government as being prone to mistakes and possible excess, and to demonstrate that Mr. Pirro, a real estate development lawyer and powerful Republican lobbyist, was simply too busy to bother with the day-to-day, mundane details of his political and personal dealings.</p>
        <p>Today, for instance, Mr. Giuffra asked Mr. Dennehy whether he had analyzed the signatures of more than 1,300 checks that had been inspected by the government for this trial. When Mr. Dennehy said he had not, Mr. Giuffra suggested that Mr. Pirro had signed only 11 percent of those checks, while his bookkeeper, Marie Tedeschi, had signed more than 80 percent.</p>
        <p>At one point, the sometimes-testy exchanges between Mr. Giuffra and Mr. Dennehy veered into unintended humor when Mr. Dennehy said his calculator couldn't handle some computations requested by Mr. Giuffra. ''My calculator overloaded,'' he said, eliciting chuckles among the jurors and the packed gallery.</p>
        <p>Not forgotten, for a change, was Anthony Pirro, who has sat quietly, unobtrusively, for most of the trial while prosecutors focused primarily on his high-profile brother.</p>
        <p>Today, his lawyer, Roger L. Stavis, suggested that Anthony Pirro was a small fish in a very big pond by compelling Mr. Dennehy to note that Albert Pirro had, over the years, hired at least three other accounting firms to tackle his books. In addition, Mr. Dennehy acknowledged that Anthony Pirro often worked with another accountant, named Joe Sparta, to handle his brother's accounts, and that Mr. Sparta's handwriting could be found on the worksheets prosecutors used in indicting Anthony Pirro.</p>
        <p>For drama, it was hard to top the suggestion by Mr. Giuffra this morning that threats against Mrs. Pirro and her children -- including shots fired at her office window in 1987 -- forced the family to install a $45,000 gate outside their home. Prosecutors had cited that expense as an improper personal deduction.</p>
        <p>When asked later about the threats, Mrs. Pirro, who appeared quite emotional in speaking outside the courthouse, said she didn't want to talk about specifics, but added: ''I think events of the past few days make it clear that people in positions of high visibility, especially prosecutors, face issues that others might not. Security has always been an issue for me and those close to me.''</p>
