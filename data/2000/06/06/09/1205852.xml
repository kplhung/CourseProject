        <p>''I always wanted this movie to be wrapped in brown paper, like pornography,'' David Fincher said. This week Fox released his film ''Fight Club'' on DVD in a slipcase illustrated to look like a wrapper tied with twine.</p>
        <p>''I wanted it with the VHS box,'' he said, ''but we gave that up to get the DVD.''</p>
        <p>In the film, based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk, a desensitized young insomniac (Edward Norton) calls on a primal aspect of himself, personified by an anarchic 60's-style radical named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), to blast out of a sterile existence and rebuild his masculinity. Part of the process takes place in a club, started by the two of them, where depressed, threatened young men gather to work out their rage and feelings of inferiority by beating one another bloody.</p>
        <p>When ''Fight Club'' was released last fall, many filmgoers held preconceived notions about its violence and nihilism. Generally, though, reviews noted the movie's wit and subtle complexity. ''This film twists and turns in ways that only add up fully on the way out of the theater and might just require another viewing,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Her thought makes a blurb on the back of the DVD box, but Mr. Fincher said that while he appreciated viewers taking another look on video, the film got its due in theaters. ''It's the kind of movie that's going to divide people,'' he said. ''You don't read the book and say here's a mainstream fastball.''</p>
        <p>DVD, he added, is essentially for preservation. ''I don't know if the film will have another life on DVD, but it will be the record that lasts the longest.''</p>
        <p>The film comes on two discs in an elaborately designed package that opens like a book. The first disc contains the film in the wide-screen, letter-box format and four separate movie-length commentaries by Mr. Fincher, the stars and various others involved, including Mr. Palahnuik and the screenwriter, Jim Uhls.</p>
        <p>The director of ''Seven,'' another violent and controversial film starring Mr. Pitt that received frequently favorable second thoughts after its theater run in 1995, Mr. Fincher is also known for lightning-fast visuals and computer-generated manipulation. The technical aspects work best on disc. ''I'm much happier having a wide-screen DVD out there than simply a panned-and-scanned DVD,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The second disc has extended scenes of the film being made. ''They must have been thinking about DVD or some sort of after-market,'' said David Pryor, a designer and producer of DVD's who made these discs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fincher said that there were no such thoughts at the time, but that he had come to appreciate the wealth of material later.</p>
        <p>Much of it was shot from multiple angles. ''I wanted to use as much of that behind-the-scenes stuff as possible,'' Mr. Pryor said.</p>
        <p>Is all of this, not to mention the hours of commentary, too much? ''Nobody is forced to look at it,'' he said. ''It's such a dense movie, the more perspectives you can get the better.''</p>
