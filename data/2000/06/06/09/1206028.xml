        <p>'A Line and a Wall'</p>

        <p>Through June 17</p>
        <p>Of all those who have made the great outdoors their studios -- from the monument-builder Michael Heizer to the conceptualist-hiker Hamish Fulton -- none have cultivated nature so sensitively and photogenically as the British artist Andy Goldsworthy. Indoors, one misses his magical play with found situations, materials and color, but the two installations here have their own impressive and distinctly different sculptural effects.</p>
        <p>One piece consists of a long, meandering line made of thin rush reeds. Attached to the wall end-to-end by thorns, the reeds create a line that wanders happily across ceilings and walls, around corners and back and forth through doorways.</p>

        <p>Of all those who have made the great outdoors their studios -- from the monument-builder Michael Heizer to the conceptualist-hiker Hamish Fulton -- none have cultivated nature so sensitively and photogenically as the British artist Andy Goldsworthy. Indoors, one misses his magical play with found situations, materials and color, but the two installations here have their own impressive and distinctly different sculptural effects.</p>
        <p>One piece consists of a long, meandering line made of thin rush reeds. Attached to the wall end-to-end by thorns, the reeds create a line that wanders happily across ceilings and walls, around corners and back and forth through doorways.</p>
        <p>The other piece is one entire squarish wall covered inches thick in mud. Smooth and unblemished at first, the mud has progressively dried, producing an all-over craquelure. It has a powerful Minimalist impact on its own. With the line piece it polarizes into a dialogue of opposites, one airy and loopy, the other heavy and dense with a deeply imbedded, jagged web. A face-off, you might say, between the mercurial and the saturnine.</p>
