        <p>The Army's decision to reassign the commander of Fort Campbell, Ky., where a gay soldier was beaten to death last year, is provoking criticism from members of Congress and gay-rights advocates who complain that an investigation of anti-gay harassment under his command has not yet been completed.</p>

        <p>The Army's decision to reassign the commander of Fort Campbell, Ky., where a gay soldier was beaten to death last year, is provoking criticism from members of Congress and gay-rights advocates who complain that an investigation of anti-gay harassment under his command has not yet been completed.</p>
        <p>The officer, Maj. Gen. Robert T. Clark, who steps down on Friday as commander of Fort Campbell and the 101st Airborne Division, was appointed early this week to be vice director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>The transfer, which does not include a promotion in rank but does put General Clark in a position of prominence, came before the Army's inspector general had completed an investigation into whether officers at Fort Campbell tolerated or overlooked anti-gay slurs and taunting in the months leading up to the killing last July of Pfc. Barry Winchell.</p>
        <p>A day after General Clark's new assignment was announced, 30 members of the House wrote to Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen urging that he hold the general responsible for what appears to have been a highly charged environment at Fort Campbell in the months before Private Winchell's death.</p>
        <p>The members -- most but not all of them Democrats, including the minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt -- also criticized the decision to move ahead with General Clark's reassignment.</p>
        <p>''Relocating and promoting Major General Clark prior to the completion of this investigation would be wrong and undermine the department's professed commitment to enforce the gays-in-the-military policy in a fair and legal manner,'' they wrote.</p>
        <p>The Army announced the investigation in January, saying it had been  requested by General Clark himself, but the deadline for completing it has been pushed back to the beginning of July from May 1.</p>
        <p>Army officials declined to discuss the reasons behind the delay. One official said that while the inspector general's investigation was not complete, nothing had emerged to implicate General Clark in wrongdoing or leadership failings.</p>
        <p>General Clark did not respond to requests for comment, but a spokeswoman said he would address the issue at his change-of-command ceremony on Friday.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the Army's chief of staff, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, said  General Clark's command at Fort Campbell had been ''distinguished by great competence and compassionate leadership.''</p>
        <p>''The Army has placed its trust and confidence in Major General Clark,'' General Shinseki said, ''and I am confident he will continue to excel in service to our nation.''</p>
        <p>Private Winchell's death has become a rallying cry for critics of the Pentagon's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which allows gay men and lesbians to serve in the military so long as they do not disclose their orientation or engage in homosexual sex.</p>
        <p>Another private, Calvin Glover, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for killing Private Winchell with a baseball bat.</p>
        <p>In Private Glover's court-martial, soldiers testified that Private Winchell had repeatedly been taunted with anti-gay slurs and that superiors had done nothing to intervene.</p>
        <p>The killing prompted Secretary  Cohen to order a survey of attitudes about gays in the military, which  found that disparaging and even hostile feelings toward gay men and lesbians were commonplace and often tolerated by superiors.</p>
        <p>C. Dixon Osborne, co-director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an organization in Washington that provides legal aid to gay men and lesbians in the military, said General Clark's reassignment suggested that the Army did not intend to hold him accountable for the actions of troops under his command.</p>
        <p>''I'm concerned that they do a full and fair investigation,'' Mr. Osborne said, ''and not try to suggest that anti-gay harassment was simply isolated to Pfc. Winchell's unit.''</p>
