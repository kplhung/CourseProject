        <p>Late in her engaging cabaret show at the Firebird Cafe, the Welsh actress and singer Sian Phillips quotes an unidentified standup comic's recipe for life: ''Dance as though no one can see you, and love as though you can never be rejected.''</p>

        <p>Late in her engaging cabaret show at the Firebird Cafe, the Welsh actress and singer Sian Phillips quotes an unidentified standup comic's recipe for life: ''Dance as though no one can see you, and love as though you can never be rejected.''</p>
        <p>''Good advice,'' she adds, ''but what a pity it doesn't always work.''</p>
        <p>With its blend of epigrams, songs, reminiscences and poetry, Ms. Phillips's show, ''Falling in Love Again,'' which plays through June 23, epitomizes a high-styled British style of cabaret that doesn't draw the boundaries between music and drama that American performers do. The only things distinguishing ''Falling in Love Again'' from a one-woman theater piece are its modest length (one hour) and its intimate nightclub setting.</p>
        <p>As a singer, Ms. Phillips, who apologized at Wednesday's opening-night performance for having lost much of her voice, has a husky lived-in contralto whose sound is not unlike that of Marianne Faithfull. But where Ms. Faithfull conveys the bawdy abandon of a reckless sybarite emerging from the ruins of her life, Ms. Phillips maintains a certain theatrical reserve.</p>
        <p>Like so many British performers, she takes particular relish in savoring well-turned rhymes, such as those in Sheldon Harnick's nonsensical parlor song ''The Shape of Things,'' Noel Coward's wistful, elevated ''Most of Every Day,'' Alan Jay Lerner and Burton Lane's ''Why Him?'' and Rodgers and Hart's ''Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered.'' Such songs segue easily into recitations that include ''The Willow Song'' from ''Othello'' (her audition as a young actress for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts) and verses by Dorothy Parker.</p>
        <p>''Falling in Love Again'' may not include much soul-searching, but it offers the comfortable pleasures of a warm, literate after-dinner entertainment.</p>
