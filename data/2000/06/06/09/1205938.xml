        <p>Anchor Weighs In Over Microsoft</p>
        <p>PETER JENNINGS seemed to  be complaining -- not on ''World News Tonight,'' but in the daily e-mail preview that goes out before he goes on the air. His gripe on Wednesday had to do with JUDGE THOMAS PENFIELD JACKSON'S decision to split Microsoft into two parts.</p>
        <p>''This is,'' Mr. Jennings said in the e-mail message, ''one of those days on which television struggles somewhat to make this a comprehensible visual story, without playing the same images over and over again. The judge doesn't make it any easier for us: He presides over a courtroom in which cameras are banned (this is true of all federal courts); he has made almost no statements in public; and he releases his rulings late in the afternoon -- giving us very little time to put together a comprehensive report.''</p>
        <p>After ''World News Tonight'' on Wednesday, Mr. Jennings was asked if he had meant to sound whinier than he usually sounds in his e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>''It didn't even occur me that I was being whiny,'' he said. ''I did not mean to whine at all, just alert people to the notion that television is different to do than newspapering. People respond quite vigorously to how the broadcast is put together.''</p>
        <p>He returned to that theme in yesterday's e-mail, addressing -- again -- ''the unique challenges of the Microsoft story for television news'' by way of mentioning a story that was in the works for last night's broadcast.</p>
        <p>''Judges such as Thomas Penfield Jackson rarely make public remarks outside the courtroom,'' he wrote. ''So it came as a surprise to many of us to see the judge interviewed prominently in two newspapers this morning.''</p>
        <p>More Is More, Short Is Good</p>
        <p>The lunch was for ELEANOR LAMBERT, the nonagenarian fashion doyenne who created the Best-Dressed List. So it was not surprising that the guests were handed a printed list of supposedly sure-fire tips on how to land on Ms. Lambert's list.</p>
        <p>The tongue-in-cheek advice came from MICKEY BOARDMAN, the senior associate editor of Paper magazine, which had organized the lunch at Indochine, a restaurant on Lafayette Street in SoHo.</p>
        <p>Among Mr. Boardman's fashion hints was this: ''Be a clown. To be great is to be misunderstood.'' Another tip was, ''Less is not more; less is less, more is more.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boardman was himself into more. He was ablaze with glitter.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lambert, who was wearing an elegant purple silk-linen pantsuit, made one of the shortest thank-you speeches on record. It was nice, she said, that a young magazine was recognizing ''an old woman.''</p>
        <p>Then she sat down, to applause.</p>
        <p>Going 'Cheap'</p>
        <p>Russia has become a destination for cost-is-no-object travelers. The talk at a tea party given by the real-estate broker ELIZABETH STRIBLING the other day was about pricey trips there.</p>
        <p>About a third of Ms. Stribling's guests said they were going the expensive way, on the Save Venice Tour later this month. That involves a $2,500 donation to Save Venice, which preserves art and monuments in Venice, plus the cost of the trip. ''It's very high end,'' said TIA FUHRMANN, the executive director of the New York office of Save Venice.</p>
        <p>Another third said that their private tour would be ''very cheap.'' Cheap is a relative thing, of course -- the price is ''less than half'' of the Save Venice trip, said PIERRE MERLE, who organized it. Mr. Merle, who founded the Stroganoff Foundation to arrange cultural exchange programs, has invited 43 friends to accompany him to St. Petersburg, where, among other things, they will have dinner in the Stroganoff Palace. Two of Mrs. Stribling's guests who will be in Mr. Merle's group are CeCe BLACK and URSULA LOWERRE.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stribling and her husband, GUY ROBINSON, are going with the Save Venice group. ''I'm so glad CeCe and Ursula are going to be there at the same time,'' she said. ''We're going to meet in St. Petersburg.'' Not for tea, she said, but caviar and blinis.</p>
