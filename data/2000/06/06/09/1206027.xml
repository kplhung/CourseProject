        <p>Ken Johnson reviews work of five Colombian artists, at Apex Art (S)</p>

        <p>Through June 24</p>
        <p>''Define 'Context' '' makes a good point: when dealing with the work of artists who live far from the major North American centers of contemporary art, viewers should be more sensitive to questions of context. But because the five Colombian artists here all work in generic international styles and tend to affirm familiar, superficial ideas about Colombian social problems (drugs, violence, poverty), the show does not do much for the cause of deeper geopolitical understanding.</p>
        <p>Two artists address the drug trade in Neo-Pop style. Miguel Angel Rojas shows a wall-size, dotted-line drawing of a cowboy scene that uses coca leaves for dots, and Juan Fernando Herran sandwiches poppy flower-patterned fabric between news photographs of a soldier displaying uprooted poppies. Delcy Morelos presents a pair of semi-abstract paintings of exploding red cubes, evoking bloodshed in Colombia. And a slide show of Jesus Abad Colorado's photojournalism offers images of violence, poverty and street life.</p>

        <p>More in tune with the exhibition's intention is an installation by Alejandro Restrepo. It combines video glimpses of a real crocodile with a pair of quotes from Hegel and the South American explorer Alexander Von Humboldt, who disagree about the relative merits of Old World versus New World crocodiles. Hegel, a European chauvinist, thinks Old World crocodiles are bigger and more ferocious; Von Humboldt knows better. Mr. Restrepo's piece speaks amusingly and instructively to the difference between myth-based prejudice and experiential knowledge.</p>
