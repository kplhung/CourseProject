        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The obvious conclusion to be drawn from the increasing number of health maintenance organizations deserting Medicare (front page, June 3) is that they cannot deliver cost-effective care. This is not surprising since they introduce an additional, and very expensive, layer of bureaucracy between payers and providers.</p>
        <p>In the early days, H.M.O.'s justified this expense by saying care was being provided more efficiently. But after a decade or so, they have squeezed the fat out of the system. The problem is not that Medicare reimbursement levels are too low, but that H.M.O. expenses -- like profits for shareholders and generous salaries for executives -- are too high.</p>
