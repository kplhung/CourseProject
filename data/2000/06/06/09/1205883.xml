        <p>A WOMAN smiles at the camera, one foot propped on the running board of a car. A man with an uncanny resemblance to Marcel Duchamp looks toward the camera, too, his head sticking out the car window.</p>
        <p>We are talking about a black-and-white snapshot, circa 1930's, palm-size. Who are these people? They are nobody and everybody, like the photographer. One of billions of amateur photographs, source unknown, the picture is a talisman of evaporated memory that over the years probably made its way from the corner drugstore to the family album, where it was briefly cherished. Then, in the extraordinary way these things happen, it traveled from attic to Dumpster to flea market into the hands of some scavenging dealer-collector, whereupon it became an item on the art market until finally wending its way to its present location: the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>Isn't life amazing? You may now come upon the snapshot in a deceptively modest, highly unusual (for this museum, anyway) and sublimely endearing exhibition called ''Other Pictures: Vernacular Photographs  From the Thomas Walther Collection.''</p>
        <p>It's a fair guess that the man, the woman and the photographer (could they still be alive?) would be surprised to find their memento in a museum. Whenever the picture was snapped, wherever that was, the man and woman peering into the sun, the photographer maybe fumbling with the shutter before saying ''Cheese!'' -- none of them, presumably, had any inkling or even desire that this snapshot would be art.</p>
        <p>But the art is there, plain as day. It is in the reflection of the woman's body on the car door: by some act of divine comic grace, the reflection happens to match up precisely with the head of the man so that he looks like the woman's ghostly, dwarflike double, a funny-surreal coincidence that, by adding a layer of unanticipated meaning to the picture, suddenly elevates it from nothing to something.</p>
        <p>Art works this way sometimes. It doesn't arrive through the front door. It sneaks in the back, the more pleasing for being the result of dumb luck. This picture would be less likable, I suspect, if we learned that a professional had planned it. The amateur's fluke reminds us of a basic good in life, and this is always heartening; we are reminded that art is out there waiting to be noticed, the only question being whether our eyes are open wide enough to see it.</p>
        <p>We have had the impassivity of the camera to help us, fortunately. During the days of box cameras with  range-finders, amateurs went around pointing more or less in the direction of what they wanted to shoot and hoped for the best, resulting in all those headless portraits and what Mia Fineman, the curator, in the accompanying book calls ''successful failures, pictures that sail past their intended targets and into the foggy ether of a different kind of truth.''</p>
        <p>Exactly. With luck, the amateur photographers captured what they wanted, but they often got plenty of other stuff in the pictures, too, cameras being indiscriminate machines. The amateur who pointed at the building behind the wrought iron fence in one snapshot in this exhibition found a giant apple blocking the view. Our accidental Atget could thank serendipity and the camera's wide lens for what turned out to be a far more intriguing photograph, although he (or was it she?) deserves credit simply for preserving the picture, an act of connoisseurship that has allowed it to come down to us. It is among several dozen pictures in the exhibition, a few in albums, all by anonymous amateurs, shot between the 1910's and 1960's, the heyday of the black-and-white snapshot. They are a catalogue of aspiring masterpieces and glorious errors: blurs, lens flares, double exposures, overexposures, intruding shadows, touchingly awkward homespun pornography and amputated compositions. (Another show to open next week at the excellent Ubu Gallery, around the corner from the museum, will present several dozen more gems, equally lovable.)</p>
        <p>You will recall that the early part of the century was when Surrealism thrived, Surrealism having its roots in happenstance and error. It was also the era of the New Vision photographers, whose unconventional viewpoints, weird croppings, infatuation with technology and tendency toward mysterious imagery are qualities variously echoed in these vernacular pictures: a worm's-eye view of a man tipping his hat brings to mind the work of Aleksandr Rodchenko. A view straight down from atop the Eiffel Tower duplicates almost exactly something Andre Kertesz once did. And a photo-booth snapshot of a woman with her back turned to the camera mimics the familiar 19th-century photograph of the woman seen from the back by Onesipe Aguado, a modernist precursor.</p>
        <p>Coincidence? Not really. Mr. Walther's taste for modernist photography accounts partly for the heavy overlap of vernacular and professional styles here. But there is also the fact that, consciously or by osmosis, amateur photographers have always absorbed the language of professionals, as professionals (Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Harry Callahan, Lee Friedlander; the list goes on) have tried to emulate the amateur's blithe innocence and authentic, sometimes comedic charm. This has caused a two-way traffic in the history of photography, which has only accelerated over the years.</p>
        <p>You are free to ignore this fact at no particular cost to the pleasure you receive, and also to ignore various links between these amateur snapshots and current art. For the record, the links include the rising tide of so-called outsider art, a catchall phrase for whatever is dubbed art that happens not to be made by people professionally trained, which includes children, animals, the insane and by extension, one presumes, hobbyist photographers.</p>
        <p>There is also the value placed by many young artists on found objects, a modernist infatuation enjoying fresh respect. Finally, private snapshots being diaristic, vernacular photographs dovetail with a diaristic trend illustrated by the works of Nan Goldin, Elizabeth Peyton and others.</p>
        <p>But none of this matters, ultimately. The pictures are actually more appealing because of their distance from, not connection to, professional art: blessedly unpretentious, the amateur photographer expected little or nothing of the public, assuming at most an audience of family and friends, thus leaving vast room for our ignorant conjecture.</p>
        <p>And this, as the old saying goes, is the beauty part. Strangers to the images, we are blissfully free to try to fill the space between what we see and what we know, an anarchic, unbridgeable gap. What is the meaning of the gesture of a woman in a tight-fitting dress bent over a panting spaniel? One hand out, index finger of the other hand pointed up, she is like a crooked John the Baptist directing us heavenward, a divine puzzle, decipherable only perhaps by dogs and the woman's descendants.</p>
        <p>Or what about the house being dragged on tethers through the water? It floats as if in the middle of an ocean, an apparition, inscrutable.</p>
        <p>And then there is the man dangling from a zeppelin. The photograph is not a bad composition, formally speaking, two dark bands sandwiching one white, with the figure of the man in the center. He is a sailor; we know that much from the silhouette of his pants and from the crowd of sailors below him. But is he on the way up or down? And how did he get there in the first place?</p>
        <p>Finally, there is the double exposure of a bedroom and a street, simply amazing, a dreamlike miscue in which bed lamp becomes streetlamp and streetlamps become bedposts and a streetcar chugs past the foot of the bed, where a tiny woman stands alone in the sunlight. Where did this incredible picture come from?</p>
        <p>Let's hope we don't find out. Much of the appeal of the best amateur snapshot is that, alienated from its source, it stays a riddle, thereby exemplifying the bigger truth that photographs by their nature never tell us as much as we expect they will.</p>
        <p>Private pictures like these disclose especially little except, maybe, about ourselves: what used to have the narrowest meaning to the person who snapped it (that's Uncle Bob ironing his pants; that's Sylvia with the sprinkler on the lawn) becomes a Rorschach of our imagination. Trying to decipher these tiny mysteries, we progress from being voyeurs to excavators, combing our memories for what we may recognize from our own family albums, from our own lives.</p>
        <p>We look for us.</p>
        <p>''No matter how artful the photographer,'' the critic Walter Benjamin once wrote, ''no matter how carefully posed his subject, the beholder feels an irresistible urge to search such a picture for the tiny spark of contingency, of the here and now, with which reality has (so to speak) seared the subject, to find the inconspicuous spot where in the immediacy of that long-forgotten moment the future nests so eloquently that we, looking back, may rediscover it.''</p>
        <p>The redolent snapshot is one in a million. Just look at the albums in the show, which consist of pages and pages of forgettable photographs. Bear this in mind before devoting the weekend to fishing through old shoe boxes, in wallets, behind the sun visor of the car, wherever you keep your keepsakes.</p>
        <p>Then again, who knows? The world, it turns out, is full of amazing little surprises.</p>
        <p>''Other Pictures: Vernacular Photographs From the Thomas Walther Collection'' is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Aug. 27. ''Snapshots: The Extraordinary Ordinary,'' is at Ubu, 16 East 78th Street, Manhattan, (212) 794-4444, from Thursday through July 21.</p>
