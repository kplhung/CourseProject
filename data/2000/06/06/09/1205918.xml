        <p>The trainer, Jerry Hollendorfer, is a perennial top 10 fixture in the national earnings standing, but he has yet to saddle a horse in a Triple Crown race. The jockey, Mike Smith, was named the nation's top rider two years in a row, but lost his place at the top after fracturing two vertebrae two summers ago in Saratoga.</p>
        <p>The horse is Globalize, who compounded the pair's misery when he was kicked by his pony and was scratched from the Kentucky Derby two days before the race.</p>
        <p>Now this tormented threesome may hold the key to the Belmont Stakes on Saturday. In a strange spring, when Fusaichi Pegasus went from Derby-winning superhorse to runner-up in the Preakness and finally a slip-and-fall-in-his-stall-no-show in the third leg of the Triple Crown, why not a little turnaround for the snake-bitten?</p>
        <p>''I'm certainly not going to be surprised if we come out on top,'' Smith said.</p>
        <p>In the field of 11 for the $1 million Grade I race, Globalize has earned the most ($621,130), won the most (five victories) and has been the most consistent (running out of the money only twice in 10 starts).</p>
        <p>So why is he 20-1 in the morning line? For the same reason many have overlooked Hollendorfer. In the last 21 years, he has notched nearly 3,000 victories and dominated what is perceived to be a second-tier circuit in Northern California.</p>
        <p>If this slight bothers Hollendorfer, whose 1999 statistics surpassed higher-profile names in the sport, he does not let on. What he says of his chestnut colt pertains just as much to him.</p>
        <p>''He's a very even-keeled horse,'' Hollendorfer said of Globalize. ''He's never tailed off.''</p>
        <p>Besides the victories and purses, Globalize comes into the Belmont with a tangible vital to winning the one-and-a-half mile marathon, a distance few horses ever run in their lifetime. He can stay close to what historically is a loping, almost European-style pace and have something left for a final dash.</p>
        <p>When the horses enter Belmont Park's wide, sweeping far turn, they will have traveled a mile, and recent history says the eventual winner will be on the lead or at least within five lengths of it. In the last 11 Belmonts, only Easy Goer and Touch Gold came on to win from far behind heading into the turn. In 1989, Easy Goer was in third place, five lengths back. In 1997, Touch Gold was in fourth, four lengths back.</p>
        <p>With the loss of Fusaichi Pegasus and the decision by Frank Stronach, the owner of Red Bullet, the Preakness winner, not to run here, the Belmont is now a race with very few precedents. It is the first time since 1970 that the Derby and Preakness winners will not run; it is also the first time in recent memory that the field will not feature a proven Grade I winner.</p>
        <p>There is only one proven speed horse, the 50-1 Hugh Hefner, and there are five proven come-from-behind types: the 8-5 favorite Aptitude, 9-2 Impeachment, 5-1 Unshaded, 6-1 Postponed and 15-1 Curule. The two favorites -- Aptitude, the Derby runner-up, and Impeachment, who finished third in the Derby and Preakness -- have won only once each in their lifetimes.</p>
        <p>In addition, Aptitude is trying to accomplish what no Kentucky Derby starter has done in the 131 previous runnings of the Belmont: win the third leg of the Triple Crown without running a race between the Belmont and the Derby.</p>
        <p>Bobby Frankel, Aptitude's trainer, shrugs off the lessons of history and pace. He says his son of A.P. Indy, the 1992 Belmont winner, was born to win this race.</p>
        <p>''The best horse will win the Belmont no matter what the pace,'' he said. ''You go a mile and a half and no one is going to steal it and no one is going to lose it from behind if they're good enough.''</p>
        <p>Some of his colleagues are not so sure. Todd Pletcher, who trains Impeachment, concedes that a leisurely half-mile run in 50 seconds would compromise his colt's chances. The trainer of Unshaded, Carl Nafzger, singles out Globalize as a significant danger. Twice his late runner has chased down Hollendorfer's colt, including in the Peter Pan where he finished  second behind Postponed and three-fourths of a length ahead of Globalize.</p>
        <p>''He'll be knocking near the front when the speed breaks down and is going to have the first look at daylight,'' Nafzger said. ''That worries me.''</p>
        <p>Smith agrees, saying Globalize will probably make the first run toward the finish line at the top of stretch.</p>
        <p>Smith, who won the Eclipse award for riders in 1993 and 1994, continues to experience misfortune on the comeback trail. He thought he had found a horse in the same league as his best mounts, Holy Bull and Skip Away, when Horse Chestnut showed up last winter in Florida from South Africa. Together, they won the Grade III Broward by five lengths and tied a track record at Gulfstream Park. But a week before the Donn Handicap, Horse Chestnut was injured and retired.</p>
        <p>''We'll make the first run,'' he said. ''Then we'll find out if we're good enough and can hang on. I think we are. I think we will.''</p>
