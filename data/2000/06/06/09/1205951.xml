        <p>Establishing its credentials as the runaway television hit of the summer, the CBS show ''Survivor,'' which chronicles the adventures of 16 people co-existing on an island off Borneo, scored extraordinary ratings for the second consecutive week, this time even drubbing ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' in every audience category.</p>
        <p>More than 18 million people watched the show Wednesday night, about 2.5 million more than watched the show's first edition last week. That time ''Millionaire,'' which ABC had scheduled in an effort to try to keep ''Survivor'' from taking off, still had more total viewers. But as ''Survivor'' added viewers this week, ''Millionaire'' lost them. It was down about 1.2 million viewers.</p>
        <p>The success of ''Survivor'' is almost certain to stoke the market for similar reality-based programs, most of which were created by European broadcast companies and which have now been offered for sale to American networks.</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' is set up as a competition in survival skills between two groups on the island. The emotional core of the show, and apparently the most important attraction for the audience, comes in its final moments each week when one group must vote one of its members either the least helpful or simply the least well-liked, or least valuable, off the island.</p>
        <p>The rapid emergence of ''Survivor'' as a hit raises the possibility that CBS might be able to duplicate ABC's feat last summer when one big hit show totally turned around the network. Before ''Millionaire'' became a weekly series, ABC was languishing in third place; it ended the season in first place almost solely on the strength of ''Millionaire.'' Then ABC was able to sell advertising in its approaching fall shows for more money than any other network.</p>
        <p>The extra advantage for CBS is the appeal of ''Survivor'' to young viewers, who are always considered more valuable by television advertisers. CBS has been handicapped for years by the fact that its shows are mainly watched by viewers over 50.</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' has clearly begun to emerge as part of the wider culture, with news and discussion about the show widespread on television and radio talk shows and coverage increasing in newspapers.</p>
        <p>The show has become prime comedy material for both David Letterman and Jay Leno on their late night shows. Mr. Letterman did a top 10 list on ''Top 10 Things That'll Get You Thrown Off the Survivor Island,'' including ''No. 10 -- Shrieking, 'This was a mistake, we're all gonna die here!' an hour into Day 1.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, USA Today carried the results of the second ''Survivor'' episode as though it were a sports event, reporting which participant was voted off the island by the other cast members (it was B. B. Andersen, a 60-year-old retired contractor from Kansas). The newspaper also conducted a poll of readers to determine whom they would have picked to evict (26 percent chose Susan Hawk, a truck driver from Wisconsin).</p>
        <p>Mr. Andersen became an instant interview subject for numerous media outlets. Besides the CBS ''Early Show,'' which will have each rejected cast member on the air every Thursday morning, Mr. Andersen appeared yesterday on Fox News Channel, MSNBC, CNN, ''Entertainment Tonight,'' ''Access Hollywood'' and the E Channel.</p>
        <p>The surprising defeat of ''Millionaire,'' the show that dominated the recently ended television season, may represent a potential threat for ABC and its corporate owner, the Walt Disney Company, whose financial picture greatly benefited from the program.</p>
        <p>Lloyd Braun, co-chairman of ABC Entertainment, said yesterday: ''None of us believe that 'Millionaire' is at any risk, in the fall or during the ratings sweep months when we'll have special events built around 'Millionaire.' We've certainly lost no faith at all in the show.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Braun said ABC was simply acknowledging that CBS will probably be able to achieve this summer what ABC did last summer, a near monopoly on media attention for its television show. But he said: ''We've had nights before where appointment shows have done well against 'Millionaire.' We certainly don't expect 'Millionaire' to beat everything every night it's on.''</p>
        <p>Among viewers between the ages of 18 and 49, ''Survivor'' had a 7.5 rating; ''Millionaire'' had a 4.7. Among the younger group of adults between the ages of 18 and 34, ''Survivor'' had a 7.6; ''Millionaire'' had a 3.6. (Each rating point represents just over one million homes.)</p>
        <p>Christopher Mergerson, 24, a music store clerk at a record store in Emerald City, Wash., said: ''It is certainly not a first of its kind, but it feels like another, much more realistic twist on the idea of a reality adventure. It also plays to very basic human instincts of self-preservation, which in itself is alluring.''</p>
