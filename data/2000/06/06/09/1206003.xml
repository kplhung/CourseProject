        <p>Prospect of $91 million in new public spending on recreational facilities in Coney Island raises question of whether Coney Island's future should be tied to its past or whether the money would be better spent on more pressing needs; the thought of recapturing Coney Island's golden days seems hopelessly nostalgic to many New Yorkers, but some are diehard believers; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Even now, after all the dashed hopes and nowhere promises, the old-timers and tourists and politicians cling like rust to the distant fantasy that Coney Island will be what it once was, as if the great cultural and demographic tides that built and then laid waste to the place were merely boardwalk phantasms.</p>
        <p>Every summer brings the same ritualistic claims that Coney Island is rebounding, that the old carny magic lurks just around the bend. With the regularity of Elvis sightings, rumors sweep through the Surf Avenue grease joints and thrift shops that scouts from Disney are sniffing about, searching with fat checkbooks for the next Times Square.</p>
        <p>So it has gone this season, though Coney Island remains pretty much what it was 30 years ago -- a cliche of seedy decay, a shrunken little strip of mostly second-rate amusements set against a charmless backdrop of high-rise housing projects.</p>
        <p>This time, there are grand plans from City Hall: a $31 million seafront stadium for a Mets farm team and $30 million more for a boardwalk face lift, including new bathrooms, information kiosks and volleyball nets. The city has carved out, subject to future budget approvals, another $30 million to build athletic and entertainment facilities in Coney Island and elsewhere in south Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>But the prospect of $91 million in new public spending is raising provocative questions about Coney Island's past and future. Should Coney Island lash itself tighter still to the remarkable history that put it on the map? Or is nostalgia more a dead weight than an anchor?</p>
        <p>Kevin Baker, who lovingly celebrated Coney Island's heyday in his historical novel, ''Dreamland'' (HarperCollins, 1999), believes that it is time for Coney Island ''to move past the dream.'' For decades, he said, the community has been paralyzed by what it once was -- a vast, swirling kaleidoscope of a million lights, a hotel shaped like an elephant, a city of dwarfs, a young Cary Grant on stilts, Boss Tweed on the run, a Murder Inc. informer falling to his death from a sixth-floor window.</p>
        <p>George Tilyou, the peerless entrepreneur who opened Steeplechase Park in 1897, once said, ''If Paris is France, Coney Island, between June and September, is the world.''</p>
        <p>Yet on a recent rainy afternoon, after leading a small group on a walking tour of Coney Island, Mr. Baker stated what to many was painfully obvious: ''I don't think it will ever be quite what it once was.''</p>
        <p>He stood before the Thunderbolt, an abandoned 1926 roller coaster that is literally being pulled apart by bushes and vines that have wrapped around the tracks like the tentacles of an octopus. ''One of the great ruins in America,'' he called it, before asking ever so gently, ''Would that $91 million be better spent building up better housing?</p>
        <p>''The people here,'' he said, ''they've been through a lot and they deserve better.''</p>
        <p>Thousands of low-income families live within a few miles of the Coney Island boardwalk. Many are holed up in high-rise projects that are crumbling from age and neglect, their window air-conditioners blowing a death rattle that can be heard from the street.</p>
        <p>In the thrift shops -- most nothing more than converted cargo containers -- mothers search through mounds of musty clothes to buy $2 Superman pajamas for their sons. Russian pensioners wander discount furniture stores, gingerly trying out cheap mattresses. Panhandlers hit on the tourists lining up for their Authentic Hot Dog Moment in Nathan's, though the uniqueness of that experience seems in question now that Nathan's can be found in highway rest stops.</p>
        <p>Among these struggling residents the wisdom of spending $91 million on recreational facilities is sometimes elusive.</p>
        <p>''I don't get it,'' said Jorge Ruiz, 53, who scrapes by on modest disability checks. ''I love the boardwalk and I like baseball, but what about our schools and our streets and our old people? These are real problems that we face right now, today.''</p>
        <p>In the shadow of that giant coat rack, the rusting 271-foot Parachute Jump, bulldozers are already at work on the old Steeplechase Park site, making way for the new stadium. Coney Island residents have been burned too many times to break into any victory dances. The baseball stadium idea has been kicked around since the mid-1980's, and memories are still fresh of Horace Bullard, the fried chicken king who spent a decade pitching extravagant plans for a new amusement park on the very same Steeplechase site.</p>
        <p>There also remains strong opposition from the Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden, who thinks it is a waste to build a 6,500-seat stadium that will be used fewer than 40 times a year by a lowly single-A ball club. Mr. Golden's staff is scrutinizing the proposal to determine whether it can be scuttled in court. ''This is a private deal on public park land with no economic return that really does very little for the people of Coney Island,'' said Greg Brooks, Mr. Golden's chief of staff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Golden's criticisms no doubt have roots in his dislike of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the prime mover behind the stadium proposal. But even proponents of the $91 million package -- overwhelmingly approved by City Council in April -- confess to some ambivalence about pouring so much money into a struggling, run-down boardwalk in the face of the surrounding distress.</p>
        <p>City Councilman Herbert E. Berman of Brooklyn, chairman of the Council's Finance Committee and a key negotiator in the deal, said he had struggled to come to grips with the issue. The thrift stores, he said, are ''shabby.'' The Thunderbolt, he acknowledged, is ''disgusting.'' But, he added: ''Cities do not live by housing alone. You've got to have culture.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berman, who grew up in Coney Island and still recalls the red glow that filled the night sky when Luna Park burned in 1944, argued that a revived boardwalk, Coney Island's calling card to the world, would generate jobs and growth that would inevitably trickle down to the neighborhoods. There are investors and property owners, he predicted, who are just waiting for a little nudge to jump back in.</p>
        <p>The baseball stadium's fiercest critics acknowledge the power of Coney Island's legacy. If there is a third rail in Brooklyn politics, it is upholding a strict reverence for Brooklyn's fabled history. And so Jeannette Gadson, the deputy borough president, waxes nostalgic about returning Coney Island to the glory of her childhood even as she ridicules the stadium proposal.</p>
        <p>''I'm not giving up on my memories because Coney Island is what Brooklyn is all about,'' she said on Wednesday, after leading local civic leaders on an inspection tour of the boardwalk. ''Coney Island is Brooklyn. It's like giving up on the Dodgers. You can't give up on that. You can't give up on your own history.''</p>
        <p>Ric Burns, a filmmaker and a close student of New York City history who directed the 1991 documentary ''Coney Island,'' said there was a stubbornness and resiliency about the place. He called it a product of the ''completely inextinguishable'' optimism of Coney Island die-hards, and he fondly quoted the late Brooklyn historian Elliot Willensky, who said of Coney Island's prospects, ''When land and water meet, wonderful things always happen.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burns warned against writing off a revival of the old Coney Island, at least as long as the Cyclone and the Wonder Wheel continue to draw hundreds of thousands of people there on summer weekends. The story of Coney Island, he said, is one of cliffhangers and strange plot twists. In the 1890's, he noted, no one would have predicted that Coney Island was about to become home to three incredible amusement parks -- Dreamland, Luna and Steeplechase -- that together drew a million visitors a day. Nor, he said, would anyone have predicted in the 1920's that Coney Island had already reached its peak. Its long decline was hastened by television, air-conditioned movie theaters, corporate amusement parks, suburbs, cars, highways.</p>
        <p>So, Mr. Burns asked, who is to say that it cannot be what it once was? And who is to say that minor league baseball, with its affordable appeal to Coney Island's traditional base of middle-class patrons, will not be the catalyst to make it happen?</p>
        <p>''One of these dreams is going to take off,'' he said, asserting that what Coney Island really needs is 20,000 new parking spaces and better exit ramps off the Belt Parkway. ''I'm convinced it will happen.''</p>
        <p>And on a warm May day, so is Kenny Kaufman, 27, the third generation of his family to make a living off Coney Island's boardwalk. With his father, Norman Kaufman, he has invested at least $1 million over the last decade in batting cages, two go-kart tracks and, this year, a new contraption that involves small boats, mounted guns and foamy balls. ''You drive the boat and you shoot the balls,'' he explained with boyish glee.</p>
        <p>On this day, Mr. Kaufman worked the token booth at the batting cages, bantering with his regulars, boasting about the speed and accuracy of his pitching machines, plotting ways to lure fans from the new stadium, discussing plans to add flowers and other touches to his go-kart tracks.</p>
        <p>''I'm committed to Coney Island,'' he said. ''It's in my blood. When people say to me, 'You've got the best batting cages in the city,' that makes me feel good. I'm in my dream here. This is it. But you gotta grind it out, you gotta be open, you gotta be street smart. My dream for Coney Island, I'll tell you, is to get it back to what it once was. Gotta get it back to what it once was.''</p>
        <p>As balls pinged off aluminum bats, as another Russian teenager slipped $2 through the window slot for 14 whacks, and as the sun began to set behind a bank of looming thunderheads, Kenny Kaufman's optimism seemed completely inextinguishable.</p>
