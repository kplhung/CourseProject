        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>''ELECTRA.'' For the average American listener of a certain age, the name Mikis Theodorakis will probably summon up the film ''Zorba the Greek'' and perhaps two others, ''Z'' and ''Serpico,'' but not much else. Mr. Theodorakis has remained active, however, and has delved into more classical genres as well. Here, in a concert performance presented by Midamerica Productions, is one of his operas, from 1995, part of a trilogy based on classic Greek themes. Peter Tiboris conducts a Greek cast, the Nyack College Chorale, the Russian Chamber Chorus of New York and the Manhattan Philharmonic Orchestra. Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $30 to $100 (James R. Oestreich).</p>

Tickets: $30 to $100 (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>''MARRIAGE OF FIGARO.'' The homespun but attractive qualities of the Amato Opera's productions and the intimacy of its shoe-box theater offer a useful change of perspective for operagoers accustomed to the big houses uptown. The casts here vary: at the very least, the singers are eager and enthusiastic; sometimes the singing shows great promise. And Anthony Amato, the company's founder, conducts the performances with an evident love of the music. The closing production of the company's season is Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' performed in English. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Amato Opera Theater, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village; (212) 228-8200. Tickets: $25; $20 for the elderly and children (Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. There are few better places in the city to hear chamber music than this barge floating on the East River, with its live, intimate acoustics and its spectacular view of Lower Manhattan. Good weather will only enhance the experience, and the performances are often as fine as the setting. Here, in programs coordinated by Paul Neubauer, an excellent violist, he is joined by other fine performers, including Christiaan Bor, a violinist, and Peter Wiley, a cellist. The big piece tonight is Schumann's mighty Piano Quintet, with Pedja Muzijevic as pianist. Tomorrow, the program offers works of Mozart, Arensky and Alfredo d'Ambrosio (about whom your guess is as good as mine, or the New Grove Dictionary's); on Sunday, works by Shostakovich, Ravel and Mendelssohn. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, and Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-4061. Tickets: $27; $25 for the elderly; $15 for students (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>GOLDMAN MEMORIAL BAND. Outdoor concerts by concert bands can be a hard sell these days: the repertory generally has an olden quality, marches and gallops not being especially in vogue now, and the amplification that is usually necessary to help these groups compete with traffic exacts a cost from whatever subtlety the playing may show. Still, the Goldman Memorial Band, which traces its roots to 1911, tends to draw fairly large crowds to its free summer performances. Its program this weekend includes John Corigliano's ''Gazebo Dances'' and David Eaton's ''Melavations,'' as well as works by Berlioz, Auber, Grainger and the band's founder, Edwin Franko Goldman. It is giving two concerts on Sunday: at 1:30 p.m., at the New York Botanical Garden, Southern Boulevard and 200th Street, the Bronx; (718) 817-8700, and at 6 p.m. at Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center (212) 807-4915. Admission to the Botanical Garden concert is free with admission to the garden; admission to the Damrosch Park concert is free (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>HINDS SISTERS. The soprano Esther Hinds and her younger sisters Grace, a soprano, and Ruby, a mezzo-soprano, share a strong identity with their West Indies heritage. Each sister grew up singing choral music in churches and schools. Though they have accomplished much individually in opera and concert work, they have been committed to the Hinds Sisters Trio since 1982, when they were introduced by the composer Gian Carlo Menotti at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C. For their Alice Tully Hall debut program on Sunday, the Hinds Sisters will sing a program encompassing early works by Purcell and Dowland, operatic fare from the 18th through the 20th centuries and spirituals. Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets are $50, $35 and $25. Call CenterCharge: (212) 721-6500 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN CHAMBER ORCHESTRA. Richard Auldon Clark and this orchestra can usually be counted on to provide an adventuresome program, and here they offer two in one day. First, in the centenary year of Kurt Weill, they perform music of that composer: ''Mahagonny'' and the ''Berlin Requiem.'' Sunday at 2 p.m., Trinity Church, Broadway at Wall Street, (212) 602-0747; admission: $2 suggested donation. Then they take up more contemporary fare: the premiere of Howard Cass's ''Breakfast of Champions,'' based on a novel by Kurt Vonnegut; Eric Ewazen's Concerto for Trumpet and Strings; and David Snow's ''On Clearwater Mountain.'' Chris Gekker, an excellent trumpeter, is the soloist in the Ewazen and Snow works. Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, (212) 247-7800; tickets: $15 and $30; $10 for students and the elderly (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>ROLF SCHULTE, URSULA OPPENS. The Hudson Valley Chamber Music Circle, which presents important artists in interesting programs at Bard College, celebrates its 50th anniversary this season. Tomorrow night's program offers the dynamic violinist Rolf Schulte with the brilliant pianist Ursula Oppens in a program of works by Janacek, Ravel and Elliott Carter. Ms. Oppens is a particular champion of Mr. Carter's music. Mr. Schulte is also noted for his advocacy of contemporary music. Olin Hall at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.; Tomorrow at 8 p.m. Pre-concert discussion at 7 p.m. Tickets: $20, senior citizens $15, and students $5; (914) 338-1172 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>SPECULUM MUSICAE. The most venerable of our new-music groups presents a program of music for clarinet, viola and piano. Those instruments are involved in trios by Ursula Mamlok, George Edwards and Jason Uechi. Elliott Carter is represented by an early piece (''Pastoral'' for viola and piano) and a recent one (''90-Plus'' for piano). Also included is Wayne Peterson's ''Peregrinations'' for clarinet. Today at 8 p.m., Christ and St. Stephen's Church, 120 West 69th Street, (212) 787-2755. Tickets: $10, students and seniors $5 (Paul Griffiths).</p>
        <p>UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY CONCERT BAND. Don't necessarily expect Eric Ewazen to be on hand to accept applause at that concert of the Manhattan Chamber Orchestra. Here, on the same evening, another work of his is being performed: ''Of a Fortress Over a River Valley,'' the first movement of ''Legacy,'' commissioned for the bicentennial of the United States Military Academy in 2002 and celebrating the 225th anniversary of the United States Army. Other works on the program include Gershwin's ''Summertime.'' Sunday at 7 p.m., Trophy Point Amphitheater, United States Military Academy, West Point, N.Y., (914) 938-2617. Admission: free (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>Dance</p>
        <p>SUE BERNHARD DANCEWORKS. The dances by Sue Bernhard and a guest choreographer, Charlotte Griffin, include one set to rap music and one inspired by a poem by Edna St. Vincent Millay. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30. Tickets: $12; $6 for students and the elderly. Hunter College Studio Theater, Thomas Hunter Hall, Lexington Avenue between 68th and 69th Streets; (212) 924-0077 (Jennifer Dunning).</p>
        <p>GERALD CASEL. The Bessie Award-winning Gerald Casel, who danced with Stephen Petronio, will present dances set to music by Edward Ratliff and Charmain LeBlanc, a Canadian percussionist and singer who will perform live. Tonight through Sunday at 8. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and the elderly. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street; (212) 334-7479 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>H. T. CHEN AND DANCERS. The interweaving of generations and cultures in Asian-American families is celebrated in ''Bian Dan.'' The choreography makes expressive use of bamboo shoulder poles used throughout Asia to carry loads, and in various scenes they come to symbolize burdens, oracle sticks and building materials. Today and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3:30 p.m., La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710. Tickets: $20 tonight and tomorrow; $15 Sunday (Jack Anderson).</p>
        <p>CAROLYN DORFMAN DANCE COMPANY. Dance by a leading New Jersey choreographer, Carolyn Dorfman, that includes new pieces set to klezmer music and jazz. Tonight and tomorrow at 8. Tickets: $20; $18 for students and the elderly. Marymount Manhattan Theater, 221 East 71st Street; (212) 924-0077 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>KATHERINE DUNHAM. Katherine Dunham, who turns 91 on June 22, is an American dance pioneer who has endured through hard times. One of the most vibrant signs of her endurance is the Katherine Dunham Children's Museum Dance Workshop, which has continued to train and perform in impoverished East St. Louis, Ill., Ms. Dunham's hometown. She and the children, aged 8 to 18, will make a rare New York appearance in a program produced by Dr. Glory Van Scott. The children's repertory includes ''Shango,'' ''Rara Tonga'' and ''Americana.'' Ms. Dunham has promised to talk with the audience from the stage after the performance. Tomorrow at 7 p.m. Tickets: $16. Symphony Space, Broadway and 95th Street, Manhattan; (212) 864-5400 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>MIMI GARRARD DANCE THEATER. An early explorer of multimedia dance, with an emphasis on lighting and electronic effects, Mimi Garrard celebrates the 35th anniversary of her company with a retrospective that ranges from the 1984 ''Exchange'' to her new ''Mythos'' and ''Tactile.'' Today and tomorrow at 8 p.m. Tickets: $15; $8 for students. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 674-6868 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>IMPROVISATIONAL ARTS ENSEMBLES. The risky art of improvisational dance, by the companies of Kelly Donovan, Meg Fry and Katie Bull, with guest artists Naomi Pressman, a dancer and choreographer, and Lou Grassi, a jazz percussionist.

        <p>MOCO: ''IN YOUR SHOES.'' If the intelligence and imagination of Kate Gyllenhaal's performing with Sally Silvers is any guide, this program of choreography by Ms. Gyllenhaal should be interesting. The dances, performed by her MoCotroupe, are set to music as various as the Macedonian mambo, a score by Azerbaijiani composers and Mozart's ''Ah, vous dirai-je, maman'' (K. 265). Today at 9 p.m.; tomorrow at 8 p.m. Tickets: $15. Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, West Village; (212) 604-4456 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>ROSA MEI DANCE COMPANY. Dance by Rosa Mei has been described as ''crunchy brain food.'' This year's meal includes the new ''Lulu in La La Land,'' set in what Ms. Mei describes as a sparse landscape of techno-industrial props. Tonight through Sunday night at 8. Tickets: $15; $12 for students and the elderly. Clark Studio Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center; (212) 924-0077 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>BEBE MILLER COMPANY. Bebe Miller celebrates the sense of touch in ''Map of the Body.'' Its various scenes concern what kinds of touching societies allow and forbid, and occasions when touching is spontaneous or ritualized. Today, tomorrow and Sunday at 8:30 p.m., St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15 (Jack Anderson).</p>
        <p>PARSONS DANCE COMPANY. David Parsons fills his company's programs with works by himself and Robert Battle, many to live music by the Elm City Ensemble.

Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $35 (Anderson).</p>
