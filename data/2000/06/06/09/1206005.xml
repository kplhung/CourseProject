        <p>The judge in the Microsoft antitrust case, Thomas Penfield Jackson, is certainly no judicial radical. A former Naval officer, he was an active Republican when Ronald Reagan appointed him to the federal bench in 1982.</p>
        <p>His record before the Microsoft case suggested, if anything, that he was pro-business. In 1987, the federal government sued General Motors, contending that its cars had dangerous brake defects. Judge Jackson sided with the car company, dismissing the government's evidence as merely ''anecdotal accounts of skidding events.''</p>
        <p>So when news reports emerged in late January that government officials involved in settlement talks in Chicago had proposed a breakup of Microsoft, Judge Jackson was alarmed.</p>
        <p>''I should tell you, I am not at all comfortable with restructuring the company,'' he said in February, in a rare audience with a sitting judge during the course of a trial. ''I am not sure I am competent to do that. Microsoft is a large and important company, innovative and admirable in a lot of ways. And it is an engine for the nation's economy. I just don't think that is something I want to try to do on my own. I wouldn't know how to do it.''</p>
        <p>But in another interview late last month, he sounded very different. He said Microsoft's recent behavior had helped change his mind.</p>
        <p>''I've been astounded by some of the statements of Gates and Ballmer,'' he said, referring to the continuing protestations of William H. Gates, the company's chairman, and Steven A. Ballmer, the president, that Microsoft did absolutely nothing wrong. The remarks that so irked him came after his legal ruling in April that Microsoft had repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws with its predatory and anticompetitive behavior.</p>
        <p>''I'm in the midst of a growing realization,'' the judge added, ''that with what looks like Microsoft intransigence, a breakup is inevitable.''</p>
        <p>And on Wednesday, he ordered just that: a plan to split Microsoft into two companies.</p>
        <p>Just as Judge Jackson's thinking has evolved, so have the views of many others in government and industry who watched the case. In interviews with The New York Times over the last several months, dozens of the state and federal officials who have investigated and prosecuted Microsoft for the last four years, as well as industry executives, described many moves by Microsoft that they think backfired and led to a resounding court defeat.</p>
        <p>At the outset, the plaintiffs and defendant seemed evenly matched.</p>
        <p>''Microsoft and the government were the perfect opponents,'' observed David Boies, the government's lead trial lawyer. ''The government has some power, but Microsoft has at least as much. Anyone else facing either one of them would be overmatched.''</p>
        <p>And watching from the bench early on, the silver-haired, 63-year-old Judge Jackson said he was awed by the legal prowess on display in his courtroom. ''It's exhilarating to watch,'' he said. ''You'll never see better.''</p>
        <p>But over the months, the balance shifted heavily in favor of the government. In fact, Microsoft's problems began well before the trial opened in October 1998. It misjudged the legal trouble that its own e-mail and other documents could create. It chose not to reach an out-of-court settlement when the sanctions it faced were a wrist-slap compared with the breakup plan it now confronts -- though those decisions, given the company's conviction that it would win on appeal, were a calculated gamble. Whether that gamble pays off will not be known for months, or years.</p>
        <p>In court, however, the Microsoft defense stumbled repeatedly. And with each misstep, the government was emboldened.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors assembled and then presented their case with ever greater confidence, continually broadening it to embrace a far richer array of charges than the one that started it all: Microsoft's decision to tie a Web browser to the Windows operating system.</p>
        <p>As the case progressed, the government presented evidence to show that Microsoft had bullied friends and competitors alike, halting innovations that threatened its Windows monopoly. And as the allegations spilled out in court, Microsoft was increasingly on its heels as it tried to argue that all the government had really shown was that the company was a rough-and-tumble competitor, not an economic outlaw.</p>
        <p>Still, Judge Jackson remained strikingly respectful of the defendant. ''There is no doubt in my mind that Microsoft is a unique, gifted, efficient and ingenious organism,'' he said in February.</p>
        <p>In the end, however, the judge lost all patience with Microsoft. On the trial's final day last month, a Microsoft lawyer appealed for another round of hearings on the government's remedy proposal, saying Microsoft could not possibly defend itself ''in the brief time given.''</p>
        <p>''In the brief time given?'' Judge Jackson retorted with a sharp tone. ''This case has been pending for two years!''</p>
        <p>In the interview the next day, Judge Jackson, observed: ''I am not aware of any case authority that says I have to give them any due process at all. The case is over. They lost.'' Besides, he added, ''I'm suspicious that they are just playing for time, hoping they will get to deal with a new administration'' that might approach the company with a softer hand.</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson agreed to be interviewed several times after testimony in the trial had ended, with the understanding that his comments could not be published until the case had left his courtroom. The discussions, beginning last September, were friendly, informal and unstructured.</p>
        <p>Officials from the Justice Department and the states agreed to similar ground rules. Microsoft's cooperation was first requested months ago; the company's general counsel granted a lengthy interview last week.</p>
        <p>The goal in all of the interviews was to understand how the case started, how it grew from a technical fight over Internet browsers into a broader battle over Microsoft's dealings with its competitors and partners, how the government won so handily, and why, to everyone's surprise, Microsoft fared so poorly.</p>
        <p>Now the case goes to appeal, where Microsoft believes it can overturn everything that happened in Judge Jackson's courtroom. As Microsoft sees it, the government's case was a grab bag of accusations based mainly on the selective use of its e-mail messages. Some of it may look bad but, Microsoft insists, none of it should add up to an antitrust violation.</p>
        <p>''It's the kind of evidence that a skilled trial lawyer can use to make the public wonder about how tough Microsoft plays this game,'' William H. Neukom, a senior vice president and general counsel of Microsoft, said in an interview at its corporate campus in suburban Seattle. ''But that is not the way the law is supposed to work.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft will also argue on appeal that evidence Judge Jackson relied on should have been deemed inadmissible -- newspaper articles, e-mail messages from low-level employees and the like. More broadly, Microsoft believes that its view of the computer industry -- for reasons that still puzzle the company's executives -- was never appreciated by the government or the judge. ''It's clear that the whole story of Microsoft, the whole story of the PC was missed here,'' William H. Gates, the chairman, said during a news conference on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson, in the February interview, said simply, ''I think Microsoft didn't take this seriously enough.''</p>
        <p>Past as Prologue  'This Antitrust Thing Will Blow Over'</p>
        <p>Joel I. Klein, a prominent Washington appellate lawyer, joined the Justice Department in April 1995 as principal deputy to Anne K. Bingaman, chief of the antitrust division. The next year, he succeeded her.</p>
        <p>His first task was to seek final court approval of a consent decree reached with Microsoft the previous year to settle a Justice Department antitrust suit. Microsoft had agreed to stop tying the sale of one software product to the sale of another.</p>
        <p>But what Mr. Klein did not know then was that Microsoft began flouting at least the spirit of the consent decree it had just signed.</p>
        <p>''This antitrust thing will blow over,'' Mr. Gates told a group of Intel executives in July 1995, according to one Intel executive's notes of the meeting, obtained by the government. ''We haven't changed our business practices at all.''</p>
        <p>In 1995, Mr. Klein heard from America Online. The company complained that Microsoft was violating antitrust law by bundling MSN, its new online service, with Windows. But the department decided not to act.</p>
        <p>In June 1996, however, Microsoft took the step that led to Judge Jackson's courtroom. For months, James L. Barksdale, the president of Netscape Communications, the commercial pioneer in software used to browse the Web, had been growing increasingly irritated by what he regarded as the bare-knuckle tactics Microsoft deployed against his company.</p>
        <p>But then Microsoft did something more: it threatened to cancel Compaq Computer's license to Windows -- Microsoft's industry-standard operating system, which Compaq could not survive without -- because the PC maker planned to feature the Netscape browser, not Microsoft's Internet Explorer.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a lawyer, but I have more than 30 years experience in business,'' Mr. Barksdale recalled recently. ''I just knew that that was something wrong.''</p>
        <p>He calls Microsoft's threat to cancel Compaq's Windows license ''the singular act'' that prompted him to take his grievances to the Justice Department. To accomplish that, he asked the company's lawyer, Gary L. Reback, to write a ''white paper'' detailing the problem.</p>
        <p>The 222-page paper accused Microsoft, among other things, of using its dominance in operating systems to force PC makers to take Microsoft's browser. And in August Mr. Barksdale sent a copy to Mr. Klein.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein said the paper got his immediate attention. ''There was a big difference in my mind between MSN and this,'' he said. ''To me, conditioning one product on another was clearly a violation of the consent decree. I authorized San Francisco to investigate.''</p>
        <p>Right away, the Justice Department's San Francisco office asked Phillip R. Malone, an up-and-coming young lawyer, to head the Microsoft team. And the next month, he and four other lawyers began faxing civil investigative demands to Microsoft for documents related to the Netscape charges and Microsoft's Internet strategy. Such demands are the civil equivalent of a subpoena.</p>
        <p>As each new request spilled out of a fax machine in Microsoft's legal department, a Microsoft lawyer would discuss the request with Mr. Malone. Then the investigators simply waited. ''The documents just arrived in the mail,'' Mr. Malone said.</p>
        <p>Never once, he added, did an investigator have to visit Microsoft and look in file cabinets or hard drives for overlooked documents or e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's lawyers examined all the documents before they were sent off. Several government officials said these lawyers should instantly have realized those documents meant trouble.</p>
        <p>''You can't be a lawyer and not know these documents are lethal,'' Mr. Klein observed.</p>
        <p>Microsoft lawyers say they understood that some of the e-mail messages could quicken a prosecutor's pulse. But they saw it as a tactical problem -- the fiery communications of business aggression, which might seem incriminating at first glance -- and not evidence of an antitrust violation. ''No smoking gun,'' in the view of one company lawyer.</p>
        <p>Yet as the boxes of papers went out the door, Microsoft's legal troubles mounted.  More remarkably, the most damaging documents -- the ones that galvanized the resolve of state and federal prosecutors nationwide -- were written months after that first government request arrived, months after Microsoft's leaders knew that everything they  wrote was likely to wind up in prosecutors' hands.</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson likened the phenomenon to the federal prosecution of drug traffickers, who are repeatedly caught as a result of telephone wiretaps. And yet, he said, ''they never figure out that they shouldn't be saying certain things on the phone.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Neukom said Microsoft had been under investigation for so long, and e-mail was so essential to the operations of the company, that managers simply could not edit every thought and continue to manage effectively. ''E-mail is a big part of how we run this company,'' he said. ''And candid, frank, open e-mail communication is a big part of our efficiency.''</p>
        <p>A Growing Case  U.S. Finds Allies In State Capitals</p>
        <p>While Microsoft dealt with the growing federal investigation, a new group took up the chase: state attorneys general. That compounded Microsoft's problems. In time, the company would face not just the Justice Department but 20 sovereign and independent prosecutors from the states as well.</p>
        <p>About the time the Justice Department's first document requests arrived at Microsoft in September 1996, Mark Tobey, an antitrust lawyer in the Texas attorney general's office, read a Time magazine cover story about the browser war with the headline: ''An epic battle is taking place between Microsoft and Netscape.'' Mr. Tobey, whose state is home to Compaq and Dell Computer, two companies highly dependent on Microsoft software, decided to have a look at the subject. He managed to get a copy of the Netscape white paper. With that and other information, on Feb. 9, 1997, the Texas attorney general's office issued its own civil investigative demand to Microsoft -- the first formal action from a state attorney general.</p>
        <p>In April 1997, the state attorneys general gathered in Washington for their annual spring conference, and during a meeting of the antitrust section chiefs, Mr. Tobey outlined what he had been doing, hoping to recruit allies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tobey's presentation on Microsoft stirred little interest -- quite the opposite, in fact. Tom Miller, attorney general of Iowa, chairman of the antitrust committee, said his first thought was: ''Oh my God, Microsoft? We're not going to sue Microsoft, are we?''</p>
        <p>But through the spring and summer Mr. Tobey argued and lobbied and eventually persuaded several of the larger states to have a look at the Microsoft documents. And in relatively short order, the accumulating evidence persuaded other states, including Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and Wisconsin, to join the investigation because the documents had stunned them.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know much about technology, or about the industry,'' recalled Richard Blumenthal, attorney general of Connecticut. But as he read the documents ''I was really struck by the brutal, overt tactics. You rarely see things like this written down.''</p>
        <p>In the minds of almost every federal and state official interviewed, three documents stood out as the most influential. The first was a white paper that Mr. Gates wrote in May 1995, titled ''The Internet Tidal Wave.''</p>
        <p>''A new competitor born on the Internet is Netscape,'' Mr. Gates wrote. As the leader in Web browsing software, Netscape, he added, could set the technical rules for Internet computing and thus ''commoditize the underlying operating system'' -- Microsoft Windows, on 85 percent of all personal computers. In other words, Mr. Gates was saying, Netscape threatened to make Windows irrelevant.</p>
        <p>The Gates memo, though not legally damaging on its own, pinned a motivation to what followed.</p>
        <p>Two more documents that arrived during the fall of 1997 got all of the prosecutors excited. They were e-mail messages by James E. Allchin, a senior Microsoft executive in charge of the Windows group. He was worried about the company's Internet strategy. Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer, was being given away and bundled with Windows. Still, it was not catching on.</p>
        <p>In e-mail messages to another senior executive written Dec. 20, 1996, and Jan. 2, 1997 -- more than three months after the federal government had begun obtaining documents relating to Microsoft's Internet strategy -- Mr. Allchin wrote: ''I do not believe we can win on our current path. Even if we get Internet Explorer totally competitive with Navigator, why would we be chosen? They have 80 percent market share. My conclusion is we have to leverage Windows more.'' He added, ''We need something more: Windows integration.''</p>
        <p>To the prosecutors, this was the smoking gun. Mr. Allchin seemed to be clearly saying that unless Microsoft deeply embedded its browser into its monopoly product -- and thus made users go out of their way to use Netscape -- Internet Explorer would surely lose. When these documents arrived at the Justice Department office in San Francisco, Mr. Malone knew he had something special. He took them to Washington and discussed them with Mr. Klein and others.</p>
        <p>''Everybody saw it; they really captured the essence of what we believed,'' Mr. Malone said. ''They had that power.''</p>
        <p>An Interim Suit  Prosecutors Cite Evidence of Threats</p>
        <p>In early October 1997, Microsoft's lawyers attended a meeting at the Justice Department to try to explain why it included its Web browsing software in Windows. At the meeting, Mr. Klein ''held up two disks, one holding Windows and the other with the browsing software,'' Mr. Neukom said. ''He said, 'You should have consulted us. It's easy to separate these.'</p>
        <p>''That was the level of analysis,'' Mr. Neukom said, indicating he was not impressed.</p>
        <p>But once again, at another crucial point, Microsoft misread its opponents.</p>
        <p>The federal government was feeling more confident. By the summer of 1997, Mr. Malone said, ''I certainly felt we had a case.''</p>
        <p>The Justice Department had not only gathered hundreds of documents from Microsoft, but had also interviewed dozens of industry executives, including crucial officers at Netscape. And by early fall, Mr. Klein said, ''it was becoming clear to me that we had a larger case'' beyond the browser question.</p>
        <p>By now, the government's inquiry had gathered evidence that Microsoft had threatened Compaq, I.B.M. and Intel; essentially bribed America Online; and tried to hobble Sun Microsystems, among others -- all to protect the Windows monopoly.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 20, 1997, Mr. Klein filed what proved to be an interim suit against Microsoft, accusing the company of violating the 1994 consent decree by forcing computer makers to take Internet Explorer along with Windows. The idea was to step in before Microsoft released a new version of Internet Explorer, due out soon, ''rather than to let that event pass, waiting for the big case,'' A. Douglas Melamed, deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's antitrust division, said.</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson was assigned that case, and in mid-December, he ordered Microsoft to offer computer makers a version of Windows that did not include Internet Explorer -- even though Microsoft had argued that Windows and Internet Explorer were the same product. Microsoft responded that the company would offer manufacturers a choice: one version of Windows that was obsolete, or another that did not work properly.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department reacted angrily, and, as it turned out, Judge Jackson was irritated, too. Asked what had struck him about Microsoft's defense during this case, the judge referred to this exchange in court, with David Cole, a Microsoft vice president, in January 1998:</p>
        <p>''It seemed absolutely clear to you,'' the judge asked him from the bench ''that I entered an order that required that you distribute a product that would not work? Is that what you're telling me?''</p>
        <p>''In plain English, yes,'' Mr. Cole replied. ''We followed that order. It wasn't my place to consider the consequences of that.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Microsoft agreed to offer a version of Windows with Internet Explorer hidden and partly disabled, and an appeals court was due to consider the case in the spring. But it hardly mattered any longer. Windows 98 was due out in just a few months, and Microsoft was saying Internet Explorer would be even more tightly entwined.</p>
        <p>The Lobbying  A Multistate Tour Leaves Ill Will</p>
        <p>In late March 1998, the antitrust chiefs in about a dozen states agreed on a multistate action against Microsoft. At the Justice Department, Mr. Klein still was not saying what he planned. Still, by the first week of March anyone watching closely could have guessed he was serious when he hired Jeffrey H. Blattner, a former chief counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as special counsel for information technology.</p>
        <p>His actual job, Mr. Blattner explained later, was chief of staff for the Microsoft case, and as preparation for his new role he read the evidence, principally the Microsoft documents. Right away, he said, ''I had a very clear sense that lawyers never get to see documents like this.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft, apparently, was paying close attention, because within a few weeks the company set out on a lobbying campaign.</p>
        <p>In late March, Dennis C. Vacco, then New York's attorney general, got a call from Fred Foreman, a former United States attorney in Chicago. They had been colleagues years earlier, when Mr. Vacco was United States attorney in Buffalo. Mr. Foreman had been hired by Microsoft, and he asked if he and representatives of his new client could come in for a talk.</p>
        <p>A few days later, the Microsoft contingent arrived in New York, including Mr. Foreman and David A. Heiner, a Microsoft lawyer. The atmosphere in Mr. Vacco's office was friendly -- until Mr. Heiner made Microsoft's pitch: Why was his company being viewed as a competitive threat, he asked. After all, he said, Microsoft holds ''only 4 percent of the worldwide software market.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft certainly knew that Mr. Vacco was not particularly well informed about the software industry. But before meeting the Microsoft group, Stephen D. Houck, a lawyer in the attorney general's office, had given him a detailed briefing about the case. Mr. Houck said Mr. Vacco did not say much in response to the 4 percent remark. But as Mr. Vacco thought about what he had been told, he said, ''I was almost derisive.'' After all, he added, the case was not about the worldwide software business. It was about the PC operating-system business, and Microsoft held about 85 percent of that market.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if they were purposely playing me because they thought I had a lack of knowledge,'' Mr. Vacco said. ''But I knew that was ridiculous.'' Microsoft's visit, he said, hardened his resolve.</p>
        <p>That scene was replayed in state after state, about 12 in all.</p>
        <p>Then, in April, the Microsoft team showed up at the Justice Department. During a meeting in Mr. Klein's conference room, they gave a demonstration of Windows 98 and the benefits that the company said resulted from the integration of Internet Explorer.</p>
        <p>''The meeting was cordial,'' Mr. Klein said. ''We knew all of these people. We'd dealt with them before,'' including ''on the MSN-America Online case, when they obviously got the result they wanted.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Neukom said Microsoft spent several days preparing for the meeting. ''It was absolutely in our best interests to understand their concerns,'' he said. But ''there was very little indication of open-mindedness on the other side of the table.''</p>
        <p>''Their mentality was that there are two separate products that you forced together to crush Netscape,'' Mr. Neukom recalled. But by then, in fact, Microsoft had given the government hundreds of documents that would provide ammunition for a much broader case.</p>
        <p>Negotiations  The Failed Efforts To Avert a Trial</p>
        <p>By mid-April 1998, the Justice Department had produced a draft of its suit that Mr. Klein, Mr. Boies and other officials took to Attorney General Janet Reno. They met with her three times over a period of several days. Ms. Reno and her staff asked many questions, but finally she gave permission to file suit.</p>
        <p>Right away, Mr. Klein asked David Boies to sign a contract as a special government employee so he could serve as the lead courtroom lawyer. Though he had worked for the government as a consultant since December, Mr. Boies only then immersed himself in the Microsoft documents.</p>
        <p>''What most impressed me was the enthusiastic zeal with which they used their monopoly power,'' he said. ''In my experience, most companies will use it, but they are nervous, uncomfortable about it. But in this case there was such clarity and baldness in the conduct. I'd never seen anything like it.''</p>
        <p>In late April, Mr. Klein and the other leaders of the antitrust division met with the leaders of Microsoft, including Mr. Gates, at the Washington offices of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Microsoft's law firm, where Mr. Gates made impassioned arguments against the suit. As Mr. Neukom recalled it, Mr. Gates told Mr. Klein, ''What we're doing is good for consumers, good for the industry and good for Microsoft.''</p>
        <p>''Bill just felt that if he could talk to them and not through lawyers, they'd understand,'' Mr. Neukom added.</p>
        <p>The government lawyers responded by laying out their allegations. They tried to get Microsoft to respond. Now the company's chairman knew firsthand that the government had a broad and potentially serious case. But ''we couldn't get them to focus on the issues,'' Mr. Boies said. ''They just kept saying they didn't have monopoly power.'' Once more an opportunity to avoid the suit slipped away.</p>
        <p>In a several phone calls in mid-May, including some between Mr. Gates and Mr. Klein, Microsoft appeared to be making a last offer to settle the case: Microsoft would allow computer makers to alter the opening screen of the Windows operating system. As the case had broadened, that issue had been added to the government's growing list of concerns.</p>
        <p>On the strength of that, Mr. Klein agreed to meet with Microsoft and hold what antitrust lawyers call ''last rites'' talks, the United States government's final approach to the defendant in search of an equitable settlement before moving to court.</p>
        <p>On May 16, 1998, the talks opened. As the two sides sat on opposite sides of a glossy walnut conference table, Mr. Boies leaned forward and looked directly at Mr. Neukom.</p>
        <p>Everyone at the table knew his deep experience in antitrust cases; he had been the lead lawyer for I.B.M. during that company's long antitrust battle with the government. ''You know, once the United States government files suit against you, everything changes,'' Mr. Boies recalls saying. ''People are more willing to come forward and testify against you. Others are more willing to question you, resist you. The whole world changes.''</p>
        <p>Still, as Mr. Boies recalled the moment, Mr. Neukom and the company's others lawyers looked back at him with blank, unwavering expressions. ''They didn't really respond other than to repeat what they'd been saying all along'' -- that the government did not understand the software industry.</p>
        <p>In Microsoft's view, it was the government that had no intention of settling the case. Mr. Neukom recalled the two days of talks ending with a senior Justice Department official telling him: ''I guess we're in litigation. You have no idea how difficult we can make your lives.''</p>
        <p>The last rites talks fell apart. And today many government officials and industry executives regard Microsoft's refusal to settle the case that day, before the suits were even filed, as the biggest mistake the company has ever made.</p>
        <p>But in another respect, the company's refusal was not surprising. During a court hearing a short time later, a Microsoft lawyer approached Mr. Boies and offered the following remark, as Mr. Boies recalled it: ''The government has been making the same arguments for eight years. We always give the same responses. Our side always prevails. When is the government going to leave us alone?''</p>
        <p>The Judge  Hoping to Avoid Another AT&amp;T</p>
        <p>As the state and federal governments were preparing to file their suits, Judge Jackson recalled last month, he watched these developments with ''a fair amount of trepidation.''</p>
        <p>Because he had tried the earlier case, this new one would come to his courtroom. It was certain to be big, complex and possibly precedent-setting. But in truth, Judge Jackson had tried only two antitrust cases in his 16-year judicial career. And to say he knew little about technology was at best an understatement. His abiding concern: ''Please don't let me screw this up!''</p>
        <p>Still, ''I thought I could do this,'' the judge said he decided. ''I'd done it before, become literate on esoteric topics for which I have no background,'' notably as a successful trial lawyer in the 1970's defending medical malpractice cases, another highly technical area he had known little about.</p>
        <p>A week after the suits were filed, the judge called the litigants to his courtroom to set a schedule and tell them he wanted a fast-track trial.</p>
        <p>Later, he said he was determined to ''stay away from disasters like the I.B.M. and AT&amp;T cases'' each of which had dragged on for a decade. ''I'm a great believer in taking evidence, closing the record as quickly as you can and then shipping it upstairs'' to the court of appeals. The very last thing he wanted, he said, was to find himself in the same position as Harold H. Greene, the judge who spent years trying AT&amp;T and then overseeing the breakup of the company. Judge Greene died in January.</p>
        <p>On June 23, 1998, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals handed down a ruling overturning Judge Jackson's decision in December ordering Microsoft to take Internet Explorer out of Windows 95. The ruling said Microsoft had every right to integrate new products into Windows, if there was a plausible consumer benefit.</p>
        <p>Microsoft was jubilant, and the plaintiffs, at first, were crushed. Judge Jackson said he was ''wounded'' -- and angry. ''I think it was wrongheaded on several counts,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boies got a copy of the appeals court decision just as he was boarding a plane for San Francisco, where he was to meet with the Justice Department's investigative team.</p>
        <p>During the trip west, he read it and then read it again, ''and by the time I got to San Francisco, I was convinced it was a good thing for us'' because ''it gave us a road map of what the court of appeals criteria would be.'' Mr. Boies could frame his case around it. Just after he landed, he explained that to the Justice Department team. But he added with a grin, ''They didn't immediately recognize our tremendous good fortune.''</p>
        <p>Through the summer, state and federal officials feverishly prepared for trial, trying with little success to persuade Microsoft's supposed victims -- computer makers and others -- to testify. ''They were afraid of Microsoft,'' said Tom Miller, attorney general of Iowa. ''We didn't have any particular success.'' But over the summer, even more useful Microsoft documents came in, and government depositions of other industry leaders gave power to the growing list of charges.</p>
        <p>The Deposition  A Mumbling Gates Delights Prosecutor</p>
        <p>By late August 1998, the trial was scheduled to begin in less than a month, and the government was still negotiating with Microsoft over the deposition of Mr. Gates, forcing Judge Jackson to postpone the opening day. Finally, in the last days of August, Mr. Boies and Mr. Houck flew to Seattle for three days of deposition interviews with Microsoft's chairman.</p>
        <p>As he set up in a Microsoft conference room, Mr. Boies said he was apprehensive as he got ready to face the powerful corporate chief. ''I was expecting him to be articulate, passionate, tough, direct, intelligent and very, very knowledgeable about everything relating to the case,'' just as he had been in their last meeting the previous spring, Mr. Boies said. In other words, ''a very effective witness.''</p>
        <p>But as soon as the deposition opened, a very different Mr. Gates was on display. This one was mumbling, uninformed, obdurate and unaware of anything related to the government's charges. And Mr. Boies was thrilled. He knew just what he had to do.</p>
        <p>''You want to capture as much of that as you can,'' he said. ''If you have a witness that says 'I don't know,' you want to get him to say 'I don't know' 1,000 times.'' Mr. Gates obliged.</p>
        <p>After the first two days of deposition, there was a five-day break before the third and final day. Surely, Mr. Boies concluded, Mr. Gates' lawyers would talk to their client in the interim, explain how damaging his testimony had been.</p>
        <p>''I was really concerned that a recharged Gates would come back,'' Mr. Boies said. ''I had two days of him in the can, and I could see its value diminishing. I almost didn't take the third day.''</p>
        <p>But he did, and Mr. Gates came back, his behavior unchanged. When the deposition ended, Mr. Boies knew he had a powerful tool.</p>
        <p>Mr. Neukom said Microsoft never expected the tapes to be used in court, only the transcripts. Had Microsoft's lawyers known the tapes would be shown in court, Mr. Neukom said, ''we would have prepared our witness differently,'' changing the style of his presentation, but not the substance. Yet, the Justice Department thought even the transcripts were inflammatory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boies was determined to play part of the Gates tape on the trial's opening day, now set for Oct. 19, and as often as he could in the days following. He said he hoped it would send this message to the judge: ''The chairman of the company doesn't have any credible explanation for what they did, even though he was intimately involved. If he doesn't have an explanation, then how can you credit the explanations of his underlings?'' The strategy worked.</p>
        <p>As he watched the Gates tape, Judge Jackson said later, he was thinking, ''I can't conceive of Bill Gates being allowed to testify like that on deposition.''</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson said it was an ''ingenious strategy'' on the part of the prosecution. ''Here is the guy who is the head of the organization, and his testimony is inherently without credibility. At the start, it makes you skeptical about the rest of the trial. You are saying, if you can't believe this guy, who else can you believe? It was a brilliant move by David Boies.''</p>
        <p>The Trial  A Loss of Patience From the Bench</p>
        <p>As the trial proceeded and the testimony grew ever more technical and obscure, many evenings the government legal team left the courtroom, and as they walked down the courthouse steps they would be thinking about the judge, and, as Mr. Boies recalled it, one lawyer would ask the other: ''Do you think he understood?''</p>
        <p>In February, looking back, Judge Jackson chuckled at the question and said: ''By and large I was able to follow what they were saying.'' Still, when Judge Jackson left the courtroom many days, he would corner his law clerks and ask them to explain the technology issues he did not understand. ''I had excellent law clerks,'' he said. ''They were computer literate enough to explain things to me. We talked all the time.''</p>
        <p>Toward the end of the trial, with Microsoft's defense in disarray, the judge grew ever more abrupt. ''There were times when I became impatient with Microsoft witnesses who were giving speeches,'' he said. In addition, ''they were telling me things I just flatly could not credit,'' echoing the impression Mr. Boies had said he hoped the judge would take away from the trial.</p>
        <p>When the main part of the trial ended on Feb. 25, 1999, the two sides held settlement discussions at the judge's urging. In fact, Judge Jackson vigorously pushed the litigants to settle, but this turned out to be another missed opportunity.</p>
        <p>By now, Microsoft could have little doubt that the government held a strong hand. The post-trial mood of the federal and state government lawyers was confident. ''I've never been involved in a case that went as well as this one,'' said Kevin J. O'Connor, an assistant attorney general from Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>But Microsoft was not ready to concede a thing.</p>
        <p>During several meetings that opened on March 29 and ended in early June, Mr. Klein told Microsoft for the first time that the government wanted to break up the company. The Microsoft team said they were unwilling even to discuss the idea. In an interview later, Mr. Neukom said he was not particularly surprised, but regarded it mainly as an opening maneuver in negotiations. But once again, that was a grave misreading; the government was utterly serious.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, during the last meeting, Mr. Klein laid out a proposal not for a breakup but for conduct remedies similar to the ones the judge approved on Wednesday. The Microsoft team listened impassively. When Mr. Klein was finished, the Microsoft lawyers said they wanted to think about it. But as Mr. Neukom said in the interview, ''It was way over the top.''</p>
        <p>At the end of the meeting, ''there was a clear expectation they would get back to us,'' said Mr. Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general. ''But they never did.''</p>
        <p>The Ruling  Overcoming Qualms About a Breakup</p>
        <p>By fall, the trial was over; only the judge's rulings were left, and Judge Jackson looked back at the experience. A fast-paced trial schedule, he said, can produce one of two results: a settlement, or a war.</p>
        <p>''And what we got was a war. This is like the battle that ended the War of the Roses,'' he said in September. ''That's the way I look at this case.''</p>
        <p>He said he was separating the findings of fact in his verdict from the final ruling, the conclusions of law, because ''I want to encourage a settlement.'' And a few weeks later the idea to ask Richard A. Posner, chief judge for the United States Court of Appeals in Chicago, to serve as mediator, hit him like ''a bolt out of the blue.''</p>
        <p>''I knew,'' he explained in February, ''that the egos were sufficiently high on both sides that, with any ordinary person, they would just say, 'So, who are you?' '' And when he called Judge Posner, ''I was grateful that, one, he would take a call from a district court judge, and two, that he didn't say, 'I have so many things going on I don't have time.' ''</p>
        <p>After four months, the settlement talks failed; Microsoft once again rejected a package of conduct remedies prepared by the state and federal governments -- certainly knowing, given the history, that a breakup proposal might well follow. And as the time for a final ruling loomed early this year, Judge Jackson was obviously troubled.</p>
        <p>''I have been in splendid isolation on this case long enough,'' he said. ''I would welcome another mind studying my work product to see if I am correct or wrongheaded. I want to move this case upstairs as quickly as possible.''</p>
        <p>That, as much as anything else, prompted him to speed through the remedy phase. ''The sooner this gets definitively resolved, the better it is for the country -- including the defendant.''</p>
        <p>As for his reluctance, in February, to break up Microsoft, Judge Jackson said last month, ''I'm still uncomfortable.'' On Wednesday, however, he accepted the government breakup proposal without alteration.</p>
        <p>''Assuming, as I think they are, that the Justice Department and the states are genuinely concerned about the public interest,'' he said last month, ''I know they have carefully studied all the possible options. This isn't a bunch of amateurs. They have consulted with some of the best minds in America over a long period of time.</p>
        <p>''I am not in a position to duplicate that and re-engineer their work. There's no way I can equip myself to do a better job than they have done. I think this is the best possible proposal, neither the most drastic that could be imposed or as loosely constructed as the consent decree'' in 1995 ''which they did not think accomplished what they intended.''</p>
        <p>As for his competence to supervise a breakup, the judge said he was certain the government would help him. Still, Judge Jackson leaned back in his chair and shook his head.</p>
        <p>''Shades of Harold Greene,'' he said with a rueful smile. ''I tried so hard to avoid the pitfalls he encountered in that trial.''</p>
