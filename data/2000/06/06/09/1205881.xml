        <p>DANCE preceded drama in ancient days and the tension between the two forms is felt today in choreography. Ballet, more than modern dance, has seen the comeback of an old opera-house genre, the full-evening narrative spectacle. But plotless ballets, sometimes dramatic in an abstract way, continue to reign supreme among American choreographers.</p>
        <p>To tell a story or not is far from a burning issue: dance-drama is no longer a contradiction in terms. Nonetheless, the great divide in aesthetics exists, is mirrored in public taste, and is embodied this weekend at American Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet.</p>
        <p>Storytelling dominates in ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' John Cranko's boisterous treatment of Shakespeare's comedy, which has its company premiere tonight at Ballet Theater, with two performances tomorrow at the Metropolitan Opera House. A high point is Kate's rollicking romance with a drumstick  as Petruchio tries to starve her into submission. Cranko was a man of the theater and ''Shrew'' was a big hit in the Stuttgart Ballet's debut season in New York in 1969.</p>
        <p>Still, if no one goes to ''Swan Lake'' just for the story, I am not sure one attends ''Shrew'' for the dancing. I once timed the ballet's opening moments to see how long it took before anyone danced a conventional step: 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>Cranko had two wonderful virtuoso leads, Marcia Haydee and Richard Cragun, for whom he created his typical Soviet-style duets. But in 1969 ''Shrew'' masked the weak technique of a young ensemble. ''Shrew'' is a brilliant exercise in blocked-out movement rather than real choreography. It is dance  poor in certain respects but expressive physical theater in its storytelling. Compare ''Shrew'' to ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' the musical based on the same material, and you won't miss the words. Domenico Scarlatti, whose music is used in the ballet, is no Cole Porter,  but then Porter is no Scarlatti.</p>
        <p>Across Lincoln Center plaza, New York City Ballet makes the case in its Diamond Project (a series of new works) that pure form in dance can be expressive in itself.</p>
        <p>This was an idea shared by the French poet Stephane Mallarme, who saw ballet as an art that invoked an ideal through abstraction.  The female dancer, in his view, could be part of a narrative but she operated on a level akin to poetry: like a poem, her dancing required no ''scribe,'' as he wrote.</p>
        <p>Plotless choreography, as promoted by City Ballet's co-founder, George Balanchine, constantly reveals rich levels of formal structures and combinations of steps in relation to music. But it can also be too plain, with nothing behind a classroom display.</p>
        <p>Pure dance has nevertheless been the norm in the Diamond Project, established in 1992 by Peter Martins, City Ballet's artistic director, to encourage new choreographers. The latest premiere, Christopher d'Amboise's ''Triptych,'' will be performed tomorrow afternoon at the New York State Theater, and Kevin O'Day's ''Swerve Poems'' is to be repeated tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>The eighth and ninth premieres are by Mr. Martins on June 17 and Miriam Mahdaviani on June 20. The Martins work will be seen along with  his ''Todos Buenos Aires'' and ''Slonimsky's Earbox.'' Both of these were performed at the May 3 gala that included Christopher Wheeldon's ''Mercurial Manoeuvres'' and Helgi Tomasson's ''Prism.''</p>
        <p>So successful were these four plotless ballets that one was obliged to rethink some occasional dark thoughts, namely that City Ballet should widen its range. It could even revert to the dramatic works and eclectic repertory it had from 1948 through the early 1960's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martins smiles at news conferences when asked if any choreographers would be drummed out of the New York State Theater should they attempt a story ballet under his watch. There is no rule, he replies, except that the classical vocabulary must be used by every choreographer.</p>
        <p>City Ballet today is the company as it was redefined by Balanchine from the 1970's until his death in 1983. Like many artists in the twilight of their careers, he pared his work down to essentials. And essentials in the Balanchine canon meant identifying music with dancing. Virtually all new ballets were suddenly named after their musical titles and older ones like Balanchine's ''Ballet Imperial'' were stripped down to plain costumes and retitled after a score (''Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2'').</p>
        <p>The process was carried on with a vengeance in the festivals that Balanchine organized in tribute to composers: Stravinsky (1972 and 1982), Ravel (1975) and Tchaikovsky (1981). Even a Balachine work that seems to hover around the edges of dance-drama like the 1980 ''Robert Schumann's 'Davidsbundlertanze,' '' given this season, is really about its music. Here, Balanchine seemed to tell a story about a Schumann-like figure descending into madness against Rouben Ter-Arutunian's neo-Romantic decor.</p>
        <p>Yet the work's ruling image of the alienated artist was directly related to the music's coded references to the composer's imaginary brotherhood arrayed against the Philistines. Even at his most theatrical, Balanchine offered a translation of the music as he understood it.</p>
        <p>Balanchine himself could turn out full-evening original narrative works. Two of his most innovative ballets were ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1962), more musical than literary in its inspiration, and ''Don Quixote'' (1965). With a stream-of-consciousness structure, that work was very different from 19th-century Russian ballet versions of Cervantes's novel.</p>
        <p>Yet Balanchine dropped ''Don Quixote'' from the repertory, and plot seemed to interest him less in his later years. One of the things he admired about Mr. Martins as a novice choreographer, he once said during a conversation, was that Mr. Martins did not tell stories.</p>
        <p>The brilliance of the Diamond Project's first four premieres in May grandly justified City Ballet's emphasis on the plotless. The question is whether City Ballet can remain true to itself only if its new works tell no story.</p>
        <p>The truth is that the City Ballet was also defined by Jerome Robbins's early choreography, which was strong on distilled dance drama. (''The Cage,'' ''Afternoon of a Faun'' and ''Fancy Free'' from that early era are in the repertory.) It was also a company that presented works by a range of choreographers, including Antony Tudor and Frederick Ashton. Even Cranko created a Gothic ballet, ''The Witch,'' danced by the company on tour in London in 1951.</p>
        <p>The City Ballet of that era is no more. But this does not mean that Ashton's ''Illuminations,'' an evocative 1950 ode to the poet Arthur Rimbaud, cannot be revived by the company that created it.</p>
        <p>The idea that City Ballet is identified with plotless works and that Ballet Theater specializes in story ballets is a formula that is only partly true. It is not surprising that the works of Tudor, Ashton and Cranko have been danced by both Ballet Theater and City Ballet. There was a time when lines were not as clearly drawn in competing aesthetics.</p>
        <p>It is no accident that Tudor, Ashton and Cranko came out of British ballet. The British are not immune to abstraction, but in dance, at least, they like to tell stories.</p>
        <p>Distinct from the 19th-century classics, the 20th-century narratives at Ballet Theater spring out of this tradition. British-born choreographers have dominated that wing of the repertory and include Kenneth MacMillan (''Romeo and Juliet,'' ''Manon,'' ''Anastasia''), Ronald Hynd (''The Merry Widow'') and Ben Stevenson, artistic director of the Houston Ballet (''Cinderella,'' ''The Snow Maiden'').</p>
        <p>Tudor's exquisite one-act ''Jardin aux Lilas'' (repeated June 16 to 17), represents psychologically driven dance from another era (1936). Its entangled tale of an arranged marriage is nothing but dramatic. But this is drama compressed and atmospheric, not spun out in the measured linear fashion of the three-act ballets.</p>
        <p>Virtually all those works, including the ''Othello'' that Lar Lubovitch created for Ballet Theater a few seasons ago, have a literary inspiration. Kevin McKenzie, the company's artistic director, makes no apologies for his preference for full-length narrative works: they afford dancers an opportunity to shine as individuals and have box-office appeal to a general public.</p>
        <p>Balanchine took 40 years to educate his public to appreciate dance for dance's sake. But in recent years, even companies directed by his disciples throughout the country have staged full-evening ballets with plot to satisfy public demand.</p>
        <p>Why that demand exists is open to debate. Possibly, the return to figurative painting has its counterpart in dance, whose audience now rejects the abstraction embraced after the 1960's. But perhaps it is also that people like to see characters with whose emotions they can identify.</p>
        <p>Mallarme warned that his ideal ballet performance was impossible as long as the spectator, because he paid for his seat, felt entitled to see a mirror of himself onstage.</p>
        <p>Still, familiar signposts in a ballet translated from literature can elevate the spirit, as Leonid Lavrovsky's ''Romeo and Juliet'' proves on the Bolshoi Ballet's current tour of the United States. Certainly, the best introduction to ballet for children is a dance work whose story they can follow.</p>
        <p>The 19th-century classics, however, are in a different category. One goes to see how ''Swan Lake'' is danced, not how it ends.</p>
        <p>City Ballet now includes a sampling from the 19th century. Balanchine and Alexandra Danilova staged ''Coppelia'' for City Ballet. Mr. Martins has added his stagings of ''The Sleeping Beauty'' and ''Swan Lake.'' Mr. McKenzie's straightforward ''Swan Lake'' is new at Ballet Theater.</p>
        <p>''Don Quixote,'' ''La Bayadere'' and ''Le Corsaire,'' all in Ballet Theater's season, have negligible or impossible plots: they are machines for dancing and it is the quality of that dancing that determines if they will endure.</p>
