        <p>Maureen Dowd (column, June 7) criticizes women who'd ''ditch work if they could afford to.''

        <p>There are, of course, those of us who have no choice but to work, climb that ladder and evolve professionally while facing gender bias head on. Whether we are demanding equality, having fun or desiring to loll about, we women are entitled, just as men are, to pursue what we want. The injustice lies in the restrictions we face in the course of our pursuits.</p>
