        <p>The vice president just was not satisfied. A team of graphic artists had labored to come up with a logo to emblazon on Al Gore's campaign buttons, bumper stickers and placards, but he felt they had failed to capture the right spirit. So he sketched an alternative, a swoosh and a star -- a simple, futuristic look with the words, ''Gore 2000.''</p>
        <p>''I took several of the suggested designs and kind of recombined them and added a different approach,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I sat down and drew that on the table with the people who had made suggestions.''</p>
        <p>It never occurred to Gov. George W. Bush to do that. When his staff presented him with a proposal for a blocky, traditional logo featuring an American flag and the words, ''George W. Bush For President,'' his response was to the point.</p>
        <p>''I just looked at it and said, 'It looks good,' '' Mr. Bush recalled.</p>
        <p>It may seem like a small thing, but Mr. Gore's keen interest in the signature of his campaign and Mr. Bush's admitted lack of interest perfectly capture the stark differences in how they are running for president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's fingerprints are on every major move or pronouncement. He prides himself on making decisions based on his judgment, built on nearly 8 years in the White House and 16 years in Congress, and not on the views of his advisers.</p>
        <p>The vice president immerses himself in policy, and often even in logistical matters. Recently, when he was in a rush to travel from New York to Washington, Mr. Gore announced that he was scuttling Air Force Two because he would make better time on the US Airways shuttle. His stunned military and Secret Service aides knew not to try to talk him out of it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, by contrast, is far more removed from specifics. He prefers to surround himself with people he trusts. Once he feels comfortable that they understand his philosophy, he leaves them to come up with proposals for him to sign off on. Notably, it was Mr. Bush's aides, not the candidate, who plotted a course of action when the campaign was in crisis after Mr. Bush lost the New Hampshire primary.</p>
        <p>The unmistakable contrasts in how Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore make decisions, handle pressure and relate to their advisers offer revealing insights into how they would run their presidencies. In extensive interviews, officials from both campaigns sought to play up anecdotes that showed that their candidate would operate most effectively in the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's supporters say his impressive knowledge base allows him to comfortably make informed decisions. Mr. Bush's backers argue that his lower level of engagement is a virtue because the governor is not burdened by needless detail.</p>
        <p>Still, it is possible to move beyond the campaigns' spin to see striking differences in the candidates' approaches.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore bases his decisions on devouring information and reaching a reasoned conclusion; Mr. Bush operates more on gut instinct. Mr. Gore often lectures his advisers; Mr. Bush expects his to tell him what he needs to know.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore happily debates policy minutiae; Mr. Bush prefers to speed through meetings to get to the heart of the matter. Mr. Gore is not bashful about sitting at a laptop and rewriting speeches; Mr. Bush prefers using a black Sharpie marker to delete sections or change a word here or there.</p>
        <p>The vice president's aides say he sometimes sees himself as the smartest person in the room, and often he is right. Mr. Bush's aides say he likes to joke to assembled advisers about holes in his knowledge, which is a healthy sign, they say, of confidence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore scours the newspapers and, often several times a day, will cut out an obscure detail or paragraph and hand it to an aide with instructions. He tries to read every word written about him. Mr. Bush's aides said the governor read about himself from time to time, but preferred to have his wife, Laura, or others sum up what was written about him.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Gore nor Mr. Bush is the stereotypical empty suit manipulated by handlers. If anything, both candidates tend to be stubborn, often not yielding to their advisers' suggestions. Not surprisingly, both are sensitive to caricatures: Mr. Gore as a control freak drowning in specifics who discounts others' opinions or Mr. Bush as a naive puppet.</p>
        <p>Insisting in an interview that his artistry on the logo was ''the exception rather than the rule,'' Mr. Gore said he tried ''to avoid getting bogged down in details.'' He made clear that his style was not like that of President Jimmy Carter, who obsessed over the schedule at the White House tennis courts, or President Calvin Coolidge, who scrutinized guest lists at White House parties.</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. Gore asserted that his grasp of policy would be invaluable in the White House. ''I like the broad brush strokes,'' he said. ''But sometimes a significant detail is actually a broad brush stroke in disguise. Sometimes, a significant detail can be a fulcrum around which the rest of the issue turns.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush made no excuses for his gaps in knowledge. ''I don't think anybody knows everything about every subject, and anyone who pretends they do is someone I don't want to be the president, because this is a complicated world,'' he said in an interview. ''The key to the presidency is to set divisions, to lay out the parameters by which decisions will be made and to encourage really good, competent people to serve the country for the right reasons and to build a team.''</p>
        <p>A Force Behind Decisions</p>
        <p>''I'm not a figurehead here!'' the vice president snapped, after a cluster of aides had failed to adequately brief him about an event in New Hampshire in the primaries.  ''I've got to know what's going on in this campaign.''</p>
        <p>If anything, that was an understatement. The reality is that Mr. Gore is the driving force behind virtually every big decision of his campaign, and many small ones. His propensity to run things himself has not scared off talented aides. But Mr. Gore often turns to them more as resources to press forward with his own decisions rather than as principal decision makers.</p>
        <p>At a meeting in late May of his closest advisers at his residence at the Naval Observatory here, Mr. Gore offhandedly told them he had settled on a new campaign strategy. He would halt the relentless attacks on Mr. Bush that some Democrats feared were doing Mr. Gore more harm than good.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'That's what I'm going to do,' '' recalled Carter Eskew, one of Mr. Gore's top advisers. ''Then he laid out a series of things, like family issues, that became the basis of the next two weeks.''</p>
        <p>Some advisers had felt it was important that Mr. Gore stay on the offensive. But no one dared to challenge him. ''When you work with somebody, you know when there's an opening -- and when there isn't,'' Mr. Eskew said. ''He was emphatic.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides also winced when he told them he would propose a sweeping reform of the campaign finance system. Many thought he would be ridiculed because of the questions surrounding his own fund-raising practices in 1996. Others worried that the issue was not a big vote-getter.</p>
        <p>Repeatedly, they tried to distract Mr. Gore by saying other matters needed attention first.</p>
        <p>''We'd divert him into some other areas and he'd say, 'What about that speech?' '' said Tony Coelho, the Gore campaign chairman.</p>
        <p>Such delay tactics, Mr. Eskew conceded, were ''a way to try to kill it.''</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Gore persisted. ''It did not give me pause,'' the vice president said of the objections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is similarly never hesitant about upending speeches or events. Early last month, when he was traveling on Air Force Two from Washington to Chicago, he abruptly discarded a health care speech after reading a clipping from a morning newspaper saying that the National Rifle Association was thrilled at the prospect of a Bush presidency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who was traveling to a conference of health care reporters, summoned aides to his cabin and announced that he would talk about gun violence. The hook: that easy access to handguns is a health care issue.</p>
        <p>His aides said they argued against it, but Mr. Gore did not budge. After Air Force Two  landed, Mr. Gore kept the motorcade waiting while he worked the phones. He called one aide in Washington about statistics he remembered that had been put out by the American Medical Association.</p>
        <p>''I asked her to quickly find out whether or not I was right in remembering that the A.M.A. had done a big statement or publication on the handgun and the health care issue,'' Mr. Gore said, ''and find relevant statistics on it. She found the statistics that I said I needed.''</p>
        <p>He then instructed his staff to rewrite the speech.</p>
        <p>That was hardly an exception. After Mr. Gore's advisers drafted a statement for him last December that castigated his own administration's policy on gays in the military, the vice president thought it was too weak. So he wrote a harder-edged statement himself, over the objections of several advisers. ''We thought it would kill him in the South,'' one said.</p>
        <p>Then, when Mr. Bush announced his plan to cut taxes by $483 billion over five years, Mr. Gore told his aides, ''We need to respond quickly.'' Riding in a sport utility vehicle headed to Ida Grove, Iowa, from Sioux City, he began calling experts like Lawrence H. Summers, the treasury secretary, and Gene Sperling, President Clinton's national economic adviser.</p>
        <p>Often, Mr. Sperling said, the vice president is ''searching for his own formulation, and he's looking for you to deliver the facts he needs to make the argument the way he wants.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sperling said Mr. Gore had quizzed him with questions like ''How does it compare with the House tax cut?'' and ''Will this consume all of the budget surplus?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore attacked the tax plan at an open meeting and then again at a news conference, saying it would squander the surplus.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, Mr. Gore plays scheduler. On the morning after the Iowa caucuses, he and his aides were operating on virtually no sleep. Finally, his entourage made it to a hotel in Nashua, N.H., for a few hours' nap before the one scheduled event of the day.</p>
        <p>But just as two aides, Michael Feldman and Chris Lehane, were falling asleep in their shared hotel room, Mr. Gore came banging on the door. ''Go away,'' Mr. Lehane shouted, not realizing it was the vice president.</p>
        <p>Finally, the two aides, wearing boxer shorts, opened the door. Mr. Gore, clad in a bathrobe with his schedule in hand, demanded, ''This is all we're doing today?''</p>
        <p>''Sir,'' Mr. Feldman reminded him, ''there's six inches of snow on the ground.''</p>
        <p>It was no use. The aides, reluctantly, added an MTV event to the schedule and a photo opportunity: they delivered coffee to the local snow crews.</p>
        <p>Because of his deep involvement in decisions, Mr. Gore cannot blame his advisers for ones that go awry, like how he distanced himself from President Clinton on Elian Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't like we dragged him kicking and screaming,'' a top adviser said.</p>
        <p>A Corporate Executive's Touch</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is not inclined to alter a speech sharply or a schedule on the fly. He behaves more like a corporate executive. His aides welcome the comparison to President Ronald Reagan, who did not dither with details and set out broad goals, despite being ridiculed as out of touch.</p>
        <p>Even at the most turbulent moment of Mr. Bush's campaign, after his humiliating loss to Senator John McCain in the New Hampshire primary, the governor stuck to his policy.</p>
        <p>First, Mr. Bush made clear to his aides that he was distressed with the state of the campaign, telling them that it had to be more aggressive and not watch idly as Mr. McCain persuaded voters that he was the only reformer in the race. Then, rather than dictate remedies, Mr. Bush dispatched his aides to come up with suggestions.</p>
        <p>''He laid out the principles of what he thought went right and wrong in New Hampshire,'' said Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist. ''Then we came up with options that were presented to him formally and informally over a couple days. He accepted them and rejected a few.''</p>
        <p>It was a far cry from what Mr. Gore did last September, when former Senator Bill Bradley began surging in polls. Without consulting his aides, Mr. Gore uprooted his listless operation in Washington and moved it to Nashville. ''I announced we were going to do it,'' he recalled, ''and that was it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides could not cite a time when the governor, responding to Mr. Gore or a news development, had ripped up a speech and turned a day's schedule on its head.</p>
        <p>''We try to control our own agenda,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director and one of his closest aides. ''That doesn't mean that he's inflexible. When Cardinal O'Connor passed away, the governor wanted to attend the funeral. That's an example of something that changed.''</p>
        <p>But even the decision to attend the funeral of Cardinal John O'Connor came at the suggestion of an aide, not Mr. Bush. ''I don't think it initially came from him,'' Ms. Hughes said.</p>
        <p>It would be unfair, though, to portray Mr. Bush as passive. He does not hesitate to overrule his advisers, and when he does he is often guided more by instinct than policy.</p>
        <p>After reviewing a speech he was due to deliver on Social Security before a group of newspaper publishers in May, Ms. Hughes said, Mr. Bush was puzzled by the content because he was scheduled to deliver a Social Security address the next week. She recalled: ''He turned around and looked at me: 'Why are we talking about just Social Security? Why aren't we talking about the importance of reforming education and rebuilding the military?' '' The speech was retooled.</p>
        <p>Before the South Carolina primary, Mr. Bush's advertising team had produced a commercial that opened with black-and-white shots of lobbyists in cigars in a smoke-filled room. The intent was to portray Senator McCain as in the pocket of lobbyists.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush rejected the commercial as too harsh. Mark McKinnon, Mr. Bush's media consultant, said: ''He was very affirmative about it: 'This isn't going out under my name.' It was not a debatable point.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McKinnon said he argued that because of time pressure it was not advisable to change the spot. ''Listen, this was in the pressure cooker of South Carolina and minutes mattered,'' he said. The governor prevailed and the shots of the lobbyists were pulled.</p>
        <p>And the night Mr. Bush defeated Mr. McCain in the Virginia primary, his aides had prepared a blistering victory speech. But in his heavy black marker, Mr. Bush deleted several pages of the most negative sections about Mr. McCain. For example, he kept the sentence, ''On the next step of welfare reform, he has no plan.'' But he crossed out the next sentence: ''His policy agenda is narrow and shallow, and it makes no place for the poor and the forgotten and the frail.''</p>
        <p>''The feeling was we needed to keep the pressure on Senator McCain,'' Ms. Hughes said. ''I told him there was a lot of frustration at headquarters.'' She said Mr. Bush telephoned several aides to explain that he did not want to undermine them, but felt that the speech was too strident.</p>
        <p>Candidates of Divergent Styles</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore fume when staff members arrive late for meetings. They have little tolerance for aides who are not prepared. Yet their styles are quite different. Mr. Gore is more like a sometimes overbearing teacher, while Mr. Bush often plays the impatient student.</p>
        <p>The governor prefers oral presentations to leafing through briefing books. ''I've seen the governor say, 'Why don't you close the book and tell me what you think is most important?' '' Ms. Hughes said. ''He gets to the heart of the matter.''</p>
        <p>Donald L. Evans, the campaign chairman and Mr. Bush's best friend, put it this way, ''His classic question is, 'Have you told me everything I need to know?' ''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush's biggest peeve at meetings is when aides leave their cell phones or pagers on, he is also known for not abiding long-winded presentations.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't sit there and let a briefing go on that isn't a good use of his time,'' said Josh Bolten, his domestic policy adviser.  ''You get maybe 60 seconds in. If there's a really good briefer who's doing a good job, you might get three or four minutes before he's interrupted.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is not bashful about pleading ignorance, and will even joke about how he failed a reporter's pop quiz on foreign policy.</p>
        <p>''If he doesn't know, he'll say, 'Hold it,' '' Mr. Bolten said. ''If somebody uses an acronym he doesn't know, he'll stop them and say, 'What does that mean?' Sometimes he says, 'Use plain English.' He's not afraid to say when he doesn't know.''</p>
        <p>Explaining Mr. Bush's aversion to too much detail about the campaign's finances, Mr. Evans said: ''We talk about the budget a fair amount. All he wants to know is, 'Are we under or over?' ''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush has no use for flip charts, aides said, Mr. Gore often draws charts on an easel. ''Some days I think he is a professor,'' said Donna Brazile, the campaign manager.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Gore acknowledged that his grasp of issues, and his certainty about how to proceed, could be intimidating. ''I think sometimes a young staffer or a new staffer who hasn't gone through the process before may feel sometimes a little hesitant to speak up in disagreement,'' he said. ''But it doesn't last long because I try to encourage it.''</p>
        <p>Still, some who know Mr. Gore worry that his vast knowledge can sometimes lead him to foreclose other points of view.</p>
        <p>''Gore comes off to me as a guy who has absolute confidence in what should be done and really isn't all that interested in what you think substantively,'' said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat who supported Mr. Gore in the primaries. ''Al is interested in getting briefed, forming an opinion and then it's settled. That reflects a political certitude: a guy who will make decisions a la Harry Truman and go home and go to sleep. Except Truman operated on a gut assessment based on a historical context. Al operates on an intellectual assessment that doesn't accommodate much input.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also compared his style to Harry Truman's. But he said that was a positive attribute.</p>
        <p>''I'm a big fan of Harry Truman's philosophy,'' he said. ''The essence of it was: 'Go ahead and make good decisions and then move on to the next decision.' Right. You live with the consequences and you get better as you go along.''</p>
        <p>Two Views of Logos</p>
        <p>The operating approaches of Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush not only reflect their experiences but also their personalities and interests. Mr. Gore had a deep interest in his campaign's logo -- as well as in helping dream up a logo for the Democratic National Convention -- because he has dabbled himself in painting and thinks political branding is important.</p>
        <p>''I've always felt that logos and other visual symbols that are seen over and over and over again actually are pretty important,'' Mr. Gore said. ''And if you get one that really hangs together well, it's much better than having one that's kind of mediocre.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush does not share that passion. In fact, asked about his logo, he replied, ''You mean what's on the bumper sticker and stuff?'' Saying that such artistic endeavors would waste his time, he added, ''There are people smarter than me on designing logos.''</p>
