        <p>John Maginnes, who is 163rd on the PGA Tour money list this year, is realistic about his standing on the tour.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I'm a Ford running against a bunch of Cadillacs out there, but all I can do is be the best Ford I can be,'' Maginnes said. ''I can't worry about what the Cadillacs are doing. I'm an old '67 Mustang with vinyl seats and eight-track cassette trying to beat up a bunch of Cadillacs.''</p>

        <p>John Maginnes, who is 163rd on the PGA Tour money list this year, is realistic about his standing on the tour.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I'm a Ford running against a bunch of Cadillacs out there, but all I can do is be the best Ford I can be,'' Maginnes said. ''I can't worry about what the Cadillacs are doing. I'm an old '67 Mustang with vinyl seats and eight-track cassette trying to beat up a bunch of Cadillacs.''</p>
        <p>Maginnes held his own today, shooting a four-under-par 67 to tie for fifth place, only two strokes behind the leader, Dennis Paulson. Though he has never won a tour event, Maginnes hoped he could build on today's round.</p>
        <p>''I can't wait until tomorrow,'' he said. ''That's the thing about this stupid game. I know I'm capable of getting it around the golf course.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't scare me to think of winning the golf tournament. I mean, I have an 18-month-old to feed for the next 25 years. My options are pretty limited as to what I can do if this doesn't work out. So I'll just keep working as hard as I can.''</p>
        <p>Switching Tours?</p>
        <p>There is speculation in the golf world that Jose Maria Olazabal, the two-time Masters champion, may leave the European Tour and compete on the PGA Tour next year.</p>
        <p>Miguel Angel Jimenez, a fellow Spaniard and a good friend of Olazabal, said he could understand Olazabal's feelings. But Jimenez said he would likely always remain a tour member in Europe.</p>
        <p>''I'm 36 years old now,'' said Jimenez, who shot a 66 to tie Davis Love III and Duffy Waldorf for second. I'm a family man, and I don't want to bring my family here. I'm very happy in the place where I live.''</p>
        <p>Lasting Memory</p>
        <p>Holding the first-round lead at this year's Masters made Dennis Paulson much more recognizable among fans, particularly that week.</p>
        <p>''Dropping my car off at the Atlanta airport that morning, I'm in the bus, and everybody is looking at me like I've got something on my shirt or something hanging of my face,'' Paulson said. ''Somebody finally said, 'You sure look like Paulson.' I said, 'Well, I am.' Then everybody is throwing stuff at me, getting me to sign stuff. It's fun.''</p>
        <p>But Paulson does not want one round at Augusta to be the signature moment of his career.</p>
        <p>''Leading doesn't mean anything,'' he said. ''You've got to win it.''</p>
