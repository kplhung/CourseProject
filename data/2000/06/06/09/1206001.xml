        <p>CHINA: U.S. ARMS TALKS -- China and the United States have agreed to resume talks on arms control issues in July, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said. Talks on arms and other topics were suspended after the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by NATO, but have gradually been reopened. China strongly opposes the American quest for a missile defense system, which China says could negate its own small force of missiles and set off an arms race. The United States wants stronger controls on Chinese missile technology exports.</p>

        <p>AFGHANISTAN: U.N. FOOD AID -- United Nations planes air-dropped an emergency supply of food into the Dari Souf district in the north, responding to reports of several deaths as a result of drought conditions. The world organization has appealed for $67.8 million in emergency aid to Afghanistan.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: EMERGENCY EXTENDED -- In the wake of a suicide bombing that killed Industry Minister C. V. Guneratne and 23 others, Parliament has extended by a month emergency powers that allow the government wide latitude in arresting people, seizing property and restricting the press.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: ECEVIT SEEKS AEGEAN TALKS -- Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said he was ready for ''friendly dialogue'' with Greece over questions of sovereignty in the Aegean Sea. During a visit to the Aegean town of Marmaris, he said Turks have ''no claims on another nation's land or sea.'' A senior adviser to Mr. Ecevit recently recommended that Turkey disband its 100,000-man Aegean Army.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: MAD-COW TESTS -- France will begin a nationwide testing program next week to look for mad-cow disease among the nation's 21 million head of cattle. The government will spend about $40 million a year on the program to test some 50,000 cows over the age of 2 that die of unknown causes or exhibit odd behavior. Officials are warning that the program could show that France has far more cases of the disease than previously known.</p>

        <p>BOSNIA: SERB SLAIN -- A former Bosnian Serb paramilitary commander, Ljubisa Savic-Mauzer, 42, was killed in a drive-by shooting in Bijeljina, the police said. During the 1992-95 Bosnian war Mr. Mauzer, left, commanded paramilitary troops called the Panthers and supported the Serb Democratic Party of Radovan Karadzic, a top war-crimes suspect. After 1997 Mr. Mauzer advocated cooperation with the West, turning former friends into enemies. He survived three other assassination attempts.</p>

        <p>SWEDEN: JAILED IN DISCO FIRE -- A court sentenced three men to prison terms ranging from six to eight years and a fourth man to three years in juvenile detention for setting fire to a Goteborg disco in October 1998, killing 63 teenagers. According to the indictment, the four, all Iranian immigrants, acted out of anger at having been evicted from the club.</p>

        <p>SWITZERLAND: CHILD LABOR ACCORD -- Twenty-seven countries have ratified a treaty in Geneva banning the worst forms of child labor, the highest number of countries signing on to any International Labor Organization treaty. Signers include the United States, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia and Mexico. The pact bars children from working in dangerous jobs like mining and in occupations like prostitution, pornography and drug trafficking.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: STRIKERS FREED -- Six leaders of a student strike at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the last of the strikers still in custody, were freed on bail of up to $5,700. The six still face criminal charges, including robbery and assault. They had been imprisoned since the federal police ended the nine-month strike in February, and their supporters staged constant protests demanding their freedom.</p>

        <p>PACIFIC</p>
        <p>SOLOMON ISLANDS: EVACUATION -- Hundreds of foreigners -- mostly women and children -- boarded an Australian Navy ship to escape rebels battling in the jungles and Honiara, the capital. The rebels have held Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, left, hostage since Monday in a coup attempt. There are 700 Australians and 220 New Zealanders on the islands. The ship, which can carry 800 people, was ready to take more people today.</p>

        <p>GAZA: PALESTINIAN SHOOTOUT -- Palestinian intelligence officers opened fire on each other at their headquarters, and two agents were hurt, in an apparent internal power struggle. A witness said the shootout involved about two dozen agents drawn into a rivalry between the head of the intelligence service, Maj. Gen. Amin al-Hindi, and his deputy, Tarek Abu Rajab.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>IRAQ: U.N. EXTENDS AID -- In a unanimous vote, the Security Council agreed late last night to extend the United Nations relief program in Iraq for another six months and authorize a far-reaching study on the humanitarian situation in the country.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>ZIMBABWE: MUGABE ACCUSED -- In a sharply critical report, Amnesty International officials accused the government of President Robert Mugabe of either instigating or condoning killings and torture in an effort to intimidate voters before this month's parliamentary elections. More than 20 people have been killed in political violence since March. Government officials denied the accusations.</p>
