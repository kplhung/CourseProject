        <p>By chopping its modest space into a maze of mini-galleries, Alleged has transformed a strong late-season group show into six entertaining solos, all of which tap into the abject, obsessive side of American life.</p>
        <p>Kim Bennett is first up to bat with inventive textile pieces that make something twisted out of domestic stitchwork. Libby McInnis, self-identified as an ''ex-sugar junkie,'' contributes a high-carbohydrate wall painting and some cut cardboard pornographic tableaus, while Brian DeGraw comes through with a chapel-like installation mixing Bible Belt apocalypticism and self-portraiture.</p>
        <p>Kim Gordon, a founding member of the band Sonic Youth, focuses on the spell cast by rock celebrity, with video stills of her 12-year-old niece singing soulfully into a hairbrush. Cameron Jamie goes after star quality of another kind in his film of a pint-size punk backyard wrestler who calls himself Mr. Fantastic and engages in a brutal face-off with a small but resilient doll.</p>
        <p>If things feel just a little too weird for comfort around Mr. Jamie, there's relief to be found in the company of the art world's premier social commentator and comedian, Alex Bag. On hand is Ms. Bag's customized 1997 Dodge van, equipped with a viewing room lined in black leather and fake pink fur. And a selection of the artist's films are playing; in one she impersonates a burned-out art school student terminally soured on life. Too bad the student can't catch a few of Ms. Bag's films, which put art, life and America in perfect perspective, which means seriously, hilariously skewed.</p>
