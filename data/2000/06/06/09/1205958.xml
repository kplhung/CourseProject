        <p>Until yesterday, Dennis Masellis hardly seemed to need a lawyer. For 12 years he was surrounded by them, as a manager in the accounting department of one of the world's largest law firms.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, his own lawyer stood by his side as he pleaded guilty to stealing $7 million from his former employer, Baker &amp; McKenzie, which has 2,700 lawyers in 61 offices around the world. Now, Mr. Masellis faces up to 15 years in prison.</p>

        <p>Until yesterday, Dennis Masellis hardly seemed to need a lawyer. For 12 years he was surrounded by them, as a manager in the accounting department of one of the world's largest law firms.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, his own lawyer stood by his side as he pleaded guilty to stealing $7 million from his former employer, Baker &amp; McKenzie, which has 2,700 lawyers in 61 offices around the world. Now, Mr. Masellis faces up to 15 years in prison.</p>
        <p>Mr. Masellis, 40, lived at Riverside Drive and 158th Street and, like many workers, received his paycheck through direct deposit.</p>
        <p>But direct deposit was more than just convenient for him. It was also the mechanism that Mr. Masellis used to increase his salary by millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>While prosecutors said that it was not yet clear where all the money went, one person with knowledge of the investigation said that Mr. Masellis collected antique costume jewelry and perfume bottles, as well as Christmas ornaments.</p>
        <p>As manager of the payroll unit in the firm's New York office, Mr. Masellis had the right to issue money to employees and process records. He created fictitious employees and then directed their salaries to his personal bank account, through direct-deposit payments from the firm,  He also arranged for the computer to deduct a negative amount of money from his check -- a maneuver that had the effect of adding that much instead, according to documents filed in Manhattan Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The firm learned of Mr. Masellis's self-administered raises last year, when it changed its accounting system. As an investigation proceeded, Mr. Masellis hired a lawyer, Norman Bloch, who then approached the Manhattan district attorney with a confession and the hope of a lighter sentence, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>''It's a very sad situation, for him and for the law firm,'' said Mr. Bloch, who would not discuss details of the case.</p>
        <p>At the firm's Chicago office, a partner, William J. Linklater, said,  ''The firm is, of course, dismayed and disappointed to learn of this breach of trust from a trusted employee.'' The loss was limited to Baker &amp; McKenzie itself, rather than clients, Mr. Linklater said, concluding, ''We are hopeful that there may be some restitution.''</p>
