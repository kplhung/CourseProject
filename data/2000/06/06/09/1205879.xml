        <p>The documentary ''Bookwars,'' a minor film about the book vendors who populate the streets of Manhattan, doesn't get into the wars until the last 20 minutes of the picture. Before that section, which deals with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's ''quality of life'' mission -- which, among other things, sought to clear Manhattan streets of vendors -- ''Bookwars'' is a slice of true life.</p>
        <p>Jason Rosette, who directed, edited and narrated the movie (it begins with the credit ''A Rosette flick'') uses the phrase ''adventures in the book trade,'' and though it's not as high-concept as ''Bookwars,'' the statement is more appropriate.</p>
        <p>The film grazes the culture of the people who sell books al fresco; Mr. Rosette spent time peddling literature and other volumes on New York's streets himself and uses a mix of videotape and film to capture fleeting moments and eccentric characters. There's Pete, who's the elder, and Rick, who's in training to be a magician, and Paul, who's referred to as ''the kid.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosette also shows the kinds of reading material found in different areas. The Avenue of the Americas ''had more comic books and porno magazines,'' he says in his mellow voice-over. ''West Fourth Street was heavy into literature and philosophy. 'Naked Lunch' is a best seller, and 'On the Road.' '' To the surprise of absolutely no one watching the film, Mr. Rosette plied his trade on West Fourth. Cool jazz by artists like the organist Jack McDuff can be heard on the soundtrack, complementing the unruffled narration.</p>
        <p>''Bookwars'' provides a glimpse into the way these guys find materials, scouting yard sales and libraries that are getting rid of unwanted books. When the police start harassing the street vendors, pressing them to produce taxpayer identification  numbers or confiscating their wares, a little tension is introduced. Mr. Rosette notes that the First Amendment offers protection for the street vendors, a protection that a court ruling emphasizes. Yet the assaults by the city and New York University on the vendors' livelihood does take a toll, driving many off the streets, and into a few happy endings.</p>
        <p>By that point, ''Bookwars'' -- which ambled through mini-profiles of Mr. Rosette's fellow vendors, all men though not much is made of this -- is nearly over. There are very few memorable moments: a gray-haired man comes to one table looking for a paperback edition of ''The Subterraneans,'' which featured the man modeling on its cover. The movie is like spending an idle afternoon browsing, and not buying.</p>
        <p>BOOKWARS</p>
        <p>Produced, directed and edited by Jason Rosette; director of photography, Mr. Rosette; music by Rich Goldstein and Little Muddy; released by Avatar Films. At the Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 79 minutes. This film is not rated.</p>
        <p>WITH: Peter Whitney, Rick Sherman, Marvin, Paul, Everett Shapiro, Polish Joe, Al Mappo, Margueritte, Ron Harris and Jason Rosette (Street Booksellers).</p>
