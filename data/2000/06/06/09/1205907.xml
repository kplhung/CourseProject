        <p>An article on May 28 about turmoil at Bennington College over the dismissal of some faculty members in a reorganization referred to events surrounding the firing of a philosophy professor, Carlin Romano. It said that before Mr. Romano's dismissal he was quoted in The Chronicle of Higher Education as calling the college president, Dr. Elizabeth Coleman, ''a serial violator of academic freedom'' and predicting that he would be fired. The Times article also said Dr. Coleman and others attributed Mr. Romano's departure to his chronic lateness with evaluations and his having threatened a dean.</p>
        <p>In fairness the article should have included a response from Mr. Romano. He denies having made threats. His prediction about dismissal came from an April 28 article in The Chronicle, which truncated a quotation from the journal's March 31 issue, in which Mr. Romano said he expected ''to be fired or in some way discriminated against or punished like everyone who has spoken out before.''</p>
