        <p>The British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, tried today to reassure anxious Sierra Leoneans of Britain's long-term commitment to its former West African colony, even as British troops prepared to withdraw next week and leave the country's security in the hands of a United Nations peacekeeping force.</p>
        <p>Making a one-day trip through Freetown, Sierra Leone's rain-soaked capital, Mr. Cook met with President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and leaders of a fragile pro-government coalition, including the heads of two militias that had fought each other for years. He then met with the civilian and military heads of the United Nations force that had teetered on the edge of collapse in early May before the British arrived.</p>
        <p>''I have assured President Kabbah that Britain wants to be a long-term partner in ensuring a stable, successful, enterprising Sierra Leone,'' Mr. Cook said at a news conference after meeting the president. ''And I can assure President Kabbah that Britain is ready to go the distance until we have achieved our joint objective of a lasting security.''</p>
        <p>The British government is proceeding with its plans to pull out its 800 marines, saying it has achieved its stated aim of stabilizing the situation here as the United Nations has built up its force by more than 3,000 to the current level of about 11,900 in the last month. Already, British soldiers who had been guarding the international airport and western Freetown have been replaced by United Nations peacekeepers.</p>
        <p>The planned withdrawal comes as many Sierra Leoneans, clearly lacking confidence in a United Nations force that appeared helpless against Foday Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front, have pleaded with the British to stay.</p>
        <p>''Don't leave, don't leave,'' said Muctar Jalloh, the unofficial mayor of a camp for people whose hands, arms or legs were chopped off as part of the atrocities that came to define Sierra Leone's war.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cook, like most foreign dignitaries before him, paid a visit to the camp, which is run by the volunteer medical agency Doctors Without Borders. He visited several amputees, including Abu, an 18-month-old boy whose right leg was hacked off above the knee when he was 2 months old.</p>
        <p>At a news conference, Mr. Cook said that Britain was not leaving Sierra Leone. A team of 180 military officials will arrive soon to train 1,000 soldiers for a new Sierra Leone army, followed later by a smaller group that will be charged with re-creating the rest of the army over the next three years. Two warships, a frigate and a supply boat, will remain anchored off the coast of Freetown, he added.</p>
        <p>''It is something I totally agree with,'' President Kabbah, sitting next to Mr. Cook, said of Britain's plans. He added: ''The British people have done a lot for us. We appreciate it.''</p>
