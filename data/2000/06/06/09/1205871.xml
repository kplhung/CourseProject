        <p>More male eyes tear up in ''Pop and Me,'' a likable documentary about fathers and sons, than turn misty in ''Frequency,'' the macho tear-jerker about filial devotion that word of mouth has turned into a surprise hit.

        <p>''Pop and Me,'' directed by Chris Roe, a generically clean-cut young Californian who seems largely untouched by life, follows the boyish filmmaker on a nine-month trip around the world with his recently divorced and unemployed 55-year-old father, Richard.

        <p>More male eyes tear up in ''Pop and Me,'' a likable documentary about fathers and sons, than turn misty in ''Frequency,'' the macho tear-jerker about filial devotion that word of mouth has turned into a surprise hit. Could it be that the tough-but-tender ethos of Robert Bly's ''Iron John'' has trickled down into the cultural mainstream despite the buckets of glib derision heaped on the men's movement? The coincidence of these two male weepies suggests perhaps yes.</p>
        <p>''Pop and Me,'' directed by Chris Roe, a generically clean-cut young Californian who seems largely untouched by life, follows the boyish filmmaker on a nine-month trip around the world with his recently divorced and unemployed 55-year-old father, Richard. While on the road, between bickering and making up, the Roes interview pairs of fathers and sons in various cultures about their relationships. Although the majority of these interviews turn out to be question-and-answer sessions that reveal almost nothing, two or three are quite touching.</p>
        <p>We visit the home of a bossy Egyptian general who, in the custom of many Muslim families, unconditionally rules the roost in a household where he is surrounded by several generations of his family. According to Islamic teaching, he tells us, children must unquestioningly obey their parents. And judging from the film's joint interview with the general and a grown-up son who lives at home and clearly idolizes his father, such strictures can help ensure a familial social stability. But even in this tight-lipped environment, as the general is questioned about whether he loves his son and awkward hugs are exchanged, the mists begin to roll into their eyes.</p>
        <p>It is in Australia, of all places, while visiting an old friend of Richard's, that the Roes' kissy-huggy ethos is stonewalled by the son of a rancher who smugly dismisses this freshly thawed style of filial camaraderie as wimpy ''American stuff.''</p>
        <p>The interviews and some pretty travel scenery are really only the glue holding together the story of Chris and Richard's thorny relationship while traveling. Their agreement before setting out is that Chris will be in charge of the film and Richard, who is footing the bill, in charge of travel, meals and accommodations. But Chris, the second of three sons, resents being bossed around by his father, and their relationship becomes increasingly strained until the end of the trip, when Chris coaxes his acrophobic dad into a dual bungee jump while holding a camera and sound equipment.</p>
        <p>For a film devoted to celebrating intimacy and the breaking down of emotional barriers, ''Pop and Me'' is oddly withholding of information about the travelers. By the end of the movie Chris, who has done a smooth job of directing, seems almost as blank as he did at the beginning. When addressing the camera he is affable enough, but we get no sense of any inner life beyond his continual peevishness about not being in command. We learn a great more about Richard, who comes fairly close to being an ideal father with his mixture of confidence, humor, optimism and general openness. Born in the  Bronx, he recalls being the son of a hopeless alcoholic who spent the last decades of his life in a mental institution. In the film's most touching story, he recalls paying a rare visit to the hospital shortly before his father's death and apologizing for being such a neglectful son. For a moment his father emerged from his fog, Richard recalls, just long enough to forgive his son.</p>
        <p>What we don't find out is anything about the career or the marriage Richard is leaving behind or why he is stranded without even (we learn at the end of the film) a home base to go back to. Talk about midlife crises! Although Richard appears affluent enough not to have to worry about making a living once he returns to the United States, his future at the end of the movie is a complete mystery. ''Pop and Me'' leaves you wishing more cards had been put on the table.</p>
