        <p>The Sunbeam Corporation, a maker of small appliances that hired and later fired Al Dunlap as its chief executive, has sued the management consulting firm that Mr. Dunlap turned to for advice on restructuring Sunbeam.</p>

        <p>The Sunbeam Corporation, a maker of small appliances that hired and later fired Al Dunlap as its chief executive, has sued the management consulting firm that Mr. Dunlap turned to for advice on restructuring Sunbeam.</p>
        <p>The suit, filed in a Florida state court against PricewaterhouseCoopers, contends that Coopers &amp; Lybrand, a predecessor firm, ''failed miserably in its duties'' when it recommended restructuring steps that the company says proved to be highly damaging. ''Cooper's inept bungling has cost Sunbeam millions of dollars,'' it says.</p>
        <p>Steven Silber, a spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers, called the suit ''baseless and without merit,'' adding that ''the overblown reckless language in this suit is akin to swearing and cursing when you don't have facts and logic behind your arguments.''</p>
        <p>The suit, which sought an unspecified amount of damages, was filed on Tuesday in Palm Beach County Circuit Court. It charged that ''the work Coopers did was superficial at best and did not contain enough detailed analysis to support its recommended 'rubber stamp' of the Dunlap restructuring'' plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunlap was hired as Sunbeam's chief executive in 1996 and fired in 1998. He is now engaged in arbitration with the company, which refused to make severance payments to him; he has retained PricewaterhouseCoopers as an accountant to help him in that arbitration. In the suit, Sunbeam said PricewaterhouseCoopers had violated its obligations to Sunbeam by taking on that assignment.</p>
