        <p>In reality, only a few minutes separated today's women's semifinals, yet it felt more like decades.</p>
        <p>After Conchita Martinez and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario had offered topspin loops, languid slices and afterthought serves of yesteryear, Mary Pierce and Martina Hingis hit the fast-forward button as they bashed the two-handed backhands and bold returns of today and tomorrow at each other.</p>
        <p>But these two matches, so disparate in form and suspense, did share one significant characteristic: the favorite lost in both.</p>
        <p>Sanchez-Vicario lost first, falling prey to her own inconsistency and to Martinez's hypnotic, anachronistic rhythm shifts by the score of 6-1, 6-2. Even more surprisingly, the top-seeded Hingis lost next, saving a match point before winning the second set but proving unable to match Pierce's big-swinging baseline tempo, public support or confidence down the stretch.</p>
        <p>Pierce, the Canadian-born American resident who represents France, began to cramp in her left calf midway through the final set but managed to close out a 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 victory. Both the sixth-seeded Pierce and the fifth-seeded Martinez had lost seven times in a row to their semifinal opponents.</p>
        <p>Three months after enlisting her brother David as coach, Pierce succeeded in putting an end to her run of bad form and fortune at Roland Garros in recent years. Hingis's streak is still very much alive.</p>
        <p>A two-time junior champion here who grew up playing on clay, Hingis has won all of the Grand Slam singles titles except the French Open.</p>
        <p>''There are many other players who have never won this tournament,'' Hingis said. ''I mean, I have a lot of years in front of me. As you see, Pierce and Martinez never won this tournament. One of them is going to win. One is 25 and the other 28. I have nothing to worry about right now.''</p>
        <p>In 1997, not at her fittest after a riding injury, Hingis was upset in the final by Iva Majoli, who has beaten few people since. In last year's final against Steffi Graf, Hingis lost her composure and the public's sympathy after crossing to Graf's side of the net to question a line call. After that match, she sobbed on French player Nathalie Tauziat's shoulder, saying, according to Tauziat, that she believed she would never win here.</p>
        <p>Today, she played well below her best, making 44 unforced errors against Pierce, who had beaten Hingis in their only previous clay-court match in 1996.</p>
        <p>''Mary was just focused,'' Hingis said. ''Definitely that was the best she played me in a long time. But on a hard court, it's a different game. She's got more time on clay.''</p>
        <p>Pierce, a French Open finalist in 1994 who has struggled here since and has been booed regularly for it, happens to be Hingis's friend and doubles partner, and they reached the semifinals together on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''It's true that Martina thinks very well on the court, and I think in watching her play singles over the years, I think I learned a lot from her,'' Pierce said. ''I think I've learned a lot from playing doubles with her, too.''</p>
        <p>The question is whether she will be able to play doubles on Friday or have enough time to recover and play her best in Saturday's singles final. While leading by 4-2 and 15-15 on her serve in the final set, Pierce leaped and hit a cross-court backhand winner (her best weapon all day) and started limping after she landed. Before serving the next point, she stretched her calf but still managed to chase down a Hingis drop shot in the next exchange and hold her serve. Still stretching between points, she then broke Hingis for the ninth time to win the match.</p>
        <p>Shortly after leaving the court, Pierce said she began cramping severely in her legs and had to spend more than an hour stretching, drinking fluids and receiving fluid intravenously.</p>
        <p>Asked if she would be able to play on Saturday, Pierce answered: ''I've never had cramps before; I don't know how I'm going to feel tomorrow. I think I've done everything possible I could this evening to help myself recover the best possible.''</p>
        <p>A healthy Martinez will be waiting. Long one of the world's best clay-court players, she is now in her first French Open final. With her mind on her father's struggle with cancer and her motivation waning, she dropped out of the top 20 a year ago. But with the help of Patricia Tarabini, her Argentine coach and doubles partner, and a Spanish sports psychologist, Guillermo Perez, Martinez has rebuilt her fitness and ranking.</p>
        <p>''Since I've been working with Patricia, I've decided to play tennis with a smile on my face, which was hard the past years,'' said Martinez, never the most diligent in practice or most joyful on court.</p>
        <p>Last month, she beat Hingis on clay en route to the title in Berlin and by then she was already having a recurring dream about winning in Paris.</p>
        <p>''I have a lot of faith in dreams, and I have never dreamed this until this year, but I have been dreaming it now for the last month or month and a half,'' she said.</p>
