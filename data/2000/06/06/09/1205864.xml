        <p>If John Ruskin is right and all great art is praise, then the exhibition of Helen Levitt's photography at the Laurence Miller Gallery is a vibrant paean to what Flannery O'Connor called the ''mystery and manners'' of childhood.</p>
        <p>In these images, which span the late 1930's through the mid-80's, even adults seem to have a childlike aura. A young woman, a wedding band on her left hand, sits on the lap of an older woman who looks troubled as she talks to an inattentive listener. Addressing the out-of-camera-range driver of a Checker cab is a woman who has a child's disregard for clashing patterns in hat, jacket and skirt. A thin elderly woman in glasses, hat, jacket, dress and rain shoes looks like a child as she absentmindedly hoses down a sidewalk.</p>

        <p>If John Ruskin is right and all great art is praise, then the exhibition of Helen Levitt's photography at the Laurence Miller Gallery is a vibrant paean to what Flannery O'Connor called the ''mystery and manners'' of childhood.</p>
        <p>In these images, which span the late 1930's through the mid-80's, even adults seem to have a childlike aura. A young woman, a wedding band on her left hand, sits on the lap of an older woman who looks troubled as she talks to an inattentive listener. Addressing the out-of-camera-range driver of a Checker cab is a woman who has a child's disregard for clashing patterns in hat, jacket and skirt. A thin elderly woman in glasses, hat, jacket, dress and rain shoes looks like a child as she absentmindedly hoses down a sidewalk.</p>
        <p>In Ms. Levitt's world, a broken record seems to skip and dance on an empty street as a child would, observed by a crowd of women's dresses in a shop window.</p>
        <p>As delightful as they are, these pictures serve as an understated foil to the masterpieces in Ms. Levitt's extraordinary oeuvre: lyrical and empathetic images of children at play or otherwise engaged on the street that was the living room for New York City's poorer residents. To look at these photographs is to be reminded that great art continues to give a delicious tingle of pleasure no matter how many times the image is viewed.</p>
        <p>Adding to the pleasure is an elegantly uncluttered installation and the decision by Ms. Levitt and Mr. Miller to make oversize prints (about 30 by 40 inches) of some of her images of chalk-drawn graffiti on city walls and other surfaces.  Four of these murals, each on a separate gallery wall, are here.</p>
        <p>Clearly the highlight of the exhibition, the murals are a bold and sly rejoinder to the recent proliferation of Walker Evans shows and books. A viewer will probably think, ''Aha, Walker Evans!'' These images are undeniably spare and frontal and direct. And they were taken in the late 1930's when Ms. Levitt, then an aspiring photographer, was sharing a darkroom with Evans and helping him make up prints for his book and exhibition ''American Photographs.''</p>
        <p>One mural, ''Poster Girl,'' is almost a knockoff of Evans's ''Torn Movie Poster'' (1930), from the tight close-up of part of a woman's face to the snippet of three letters on the left. But while Evans's pictures of signs are laconic and, in some instances, iconic, Ms. Levitt's chalk-graffiti photographs are all of a piece with her images of children. Like the children who leave their delicate, innocently baroque marks on city walls, these images are both stringently unsentimental and wonderfully endearing.</p>
        <p>In ''Face on Tin,'' who else but a child would see in the wreath pattern  on a piece of embossed tin just the place to draw curls of hair around a round face? Would the child, though, have noticed that above this handiwork is a poster publicizing an ''8-year-old child sensation''? As for  ''Poster Girl,'' the real girl outlined in chalk, and seemingly floating near the poster girl's shoulder, has big eyes, big lips, spots of rouge on her cheeks, long curly hair and a heart-shaped bosom.</p>
        <p>With its combination of austere minimalism and impudent whimsy, ''Fresh Eggs'' is a most appealing mural. A poster showing a carton of a dozen eggs with the letter P suspended in the dark void around the box inspires a child to put smiling faces on a number of eggs and, inexplicably, to cross out one row of them.</p>
        <p>While the Evans touch is evident in the murals, a number of Ms. Levitt's smaller black-and-white prints show the influence of Henri Cartier-Bresson, whom Ms. Levitt met in 1935 during his yearlong stay in New York City. She bought a Leica that year, the same small, hand-held camera that the French photographer used; it became Ms. Levitt's preferred camera. Both Evans and  Cartier-Bresson focused on the commonplace in life, as has Ms. Levitt. With her keen interests in music, dance and movies, she appreciated the transfiguring, fluid choreography at the heart of the Bressonian decisive moment.</p>
        <p>But for much of her work, Ms. Levitt developed a poetics of photography that combined what she liked best about Evans's art with what she admired in Cartier-Bresson's. As she focused on the residents of the city's humbler neighborhoods, wrote her friend James Agee, Ms. Levitt lent her work a spontaneity, grace and lyricism that were seldom seen ''outside the best of jazz.''</p>
        <p>Many of Ms. Levitt's most captivating pictures are here, including those of three children with Halloween masks and the white girl and black boy twirling in a dance of their own imagining. In an unusually intricate tableau, a group of boys hover in a circle around a large, empty mirror frame on a crowded street. Two  boys, minds elsewhere, hold the vertical sides of the frame. In the foreground boys watch closely as one attends to the mirror shards in the gutter. Sharing center stage with the frame is a perplexed younger boy on a tricycle, who seems transfixed within the frame, either staring at the broken glass on the ground or perplexed by the experience of looking at the world through a looking-glass frame.</p>
        <p>There are lesser-known images, too. In one of Ms. Levitt's early and more mystifying pictures, two girls, perhaps 7 or 8, stand with a younger child between them, as if at a grave site. One girl holds a life-size baby doll in one arm. The other, holding a bunch of flowers, tilts her head and looks pensive.</p>
        <p>Among Ms. Levitt's color work here is a complex 1972 photograph that seems to have elements from earlier pictures. On the right a boy and a girl dance happily. Another boy and a child look at something out of camera range to the left. In the middle an older girl fusses with a big bag of laundry like a grown-up.</p>
        <p>In the 1989 book ''Photography Speaks: 66 Photographers on Their Art,'' Ms. Levitt's entry was characteristically brief: ''All I can say about the work I try to do is that the aesthetic is in reality itself.''</p>
        <p>For more than six decades, that reality was found mostly on the unfashionable streets of Manhattan, and it is on display in this exhibition.</p>
        <p>''Helen Levitt'' is at the Laurence Miller Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 397-3930, through June 29.</p>
