        <p>A judge's ruling that gave some foster parents the same rights as birth parents in cases where the authorities remove children from a home was struck down yesterday by a federal appeals court.</p>
        <p>The original ruling, issued in September 1998, held that such foster parents have constitutional due-process rights to contest a removal promptly. It had been hailed by children's-rights lawyers as expanding the definition of a family and shielding children with no other parents from arbitrary removals from their long-term foster families. Lawyers for the city had argued that giving foster parents such rights could hamper child welfare workers trying to remove children from dangerous foster homes.</p>
        <p>A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the ruling.</p>
        <p>In 1977, the United States Supreme Court chose not to resolve the question of whether there was a constitutionally protected right in the relationship of foster parent and child. In recent decisions, however, the Supreme Court has shown a willingness to say that significant relationships between children and people who are not their biological parents may deserve protection.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they would appeal the new ruling. Family-law experts said the case, which was decided on narrow grounds, could provide the Supreme Court with an opportunity to clarify its position on the broader and contentious issue of what rights arise from relationships in a changing array of family situations.</p>
        <p>The case involves a 4-year-old boy who was about to be adopted by his foster mother but was abruptly removed from her home in the Bronx when a caseworker found him being watched only by the woman's 12-year-old learning-disabled son. The 4-year-old had been in her care since infancy, and his birth parents' rights had been terminated.</p>
        <p>Nearly four months passed before the foster mother, Sylvia Rodriguez, was granted a hearing to contest the removal, and meanwhile, visits with the child, Andrew, were denied by the foster care agency, Cardinal McCloskey Children's and Family Services. After a city investigation, the child was returned to her care, and she has since adopted him.</p>
        <p>The earlier decision, by Judge Kimba M. Wood of Federal District Court in Manhattan, was a broad 50-page ruling extending constitutional protection. It held that although the removal was justifiable, under the circumstances, the foster mother and the child could sue the city for damages for violating her right to a prompt hearing and denying visits.</p>
        <p>A federal jury subsequently awarded Ms. Rodriguez and Andrew $50,000 in damages, finding that the agency had shown ''callous disregard'' of their rights. The appellate court's ruling voids that award.</p>
        <p>Justice Amalya L. Kearse, who was joined by Ralph K. Winter and Norman A. Mordue, the panel called the handling of Ms. Rodriguez's case by the foster care agency ''a judgmental error,'' but held that Ms. Rodriguez was not entitled to sue because under her adoption agreement -- as in all other city-supervised cases -- legal custody would not shift  to the parent until the adoption was final.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rodriguez cited a state regulation that includes in the definition of an adoptive parent ''a person with whom a child has been placed for adoption.'' The regulation requires that ''efforts to remove a child from the care and custody of his biological parent, adoptive parent, or legal guardian'' shall be made only when it is in the child's best interest.</p>
        <p>But the appeals court held that though Ms. Rodriguez fell within the statute's definition, it did not apply to her and Andrew, since she did not yet have legal custody.</p>
        <p>The ruling potentially affects thousands of children and foster parents. According to city figures, of 34,099 children in New York City foster care in April, 2,875 were legally free for adoption and in a pre-adoptive home with a signed agreement -- the category encompassed by Judge Wood's original ruling. An additional 2,201 children have had their parent's rights legally terminated but are not yet in pre-adoptive homes, and 13,500 have the goal of adoption.</p>
        <p>Jonathan M. Sobel, a lawyer with Chadbourne &amp; Parke, which is representing Ms. Rodriguez and Andrew,  said that if the decision stood, it would nullify the statute's effort to protect children from the arbitrary breakup of relationships that often have the same emotional strength as biological bonds.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Scoppetta, commissioner of the city's Administration for Children's Services, noted that the administration itself had criticized the contract agency's handling of the case, especially the denial of visits. ''There's an emotional tie, there's a relationship,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Scoppetta said the court was correct in holding that constitutional protections did not apply because ''her investment in the child, her development of emotional ties, all began as a partnership with the state.'' The court, he added, properly distinguished between the rights of a parent, who is entitled to a hearing within 24 hours of an emergency removal, and the rights of ''someone who is potentially a parent.''</p>
        <p>Leonard Koerner, chief of appeals for the City Law Department, said the city wanted to overturn the 1998 ruling in part because of the potential for financial liability.</p>
        <p>''You don't want the agency to worry about damages every time they want to remove a child,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Martin Guggenheim, a professor of law at New York University, said the core issue was the child's right to due process review, considering his best interests before the state disrupted such an important relationship.</p>
        <p>In its last word directly on the issue, in 1977, the Supreme Court noted that ''at least where a child has been placed in foster care as an infant, has never known his natural parents, and has remained continuously for several years in the care of the same foster parents, it is natural that the foster family should hold the same place in the emotional life of the foster child, and fulfill the same socializing functions as the natural family.''</p>
