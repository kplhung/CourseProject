        <p>The door to President Clinton's suite was closed for much of the trip, meaning, ''Do Not Disturb.'' The lights were out in the Secret Service cabin. In the back of the plane, the journalists had their mouths open but only heavy breathing was coming out.</p>
        <p>During occasional moments of consciousness, more than one passenger aboard the presidential aircraft blamed Vice President Al Gore for their out-of-whack body clocks.</p>
        <p>In other times, it might have been Air Force Two streaking back and forth across the Pacific like a commuter shuttle for the funeral of a fallen prime minister. Memorial services have long been part of the unwritten portfolio of the vice president, and this one, in the opinion of some White House aides, had Mr. Gore's name written all over it.</p>
        <p>Jet-Lagged Presidential Mourner</p>
        <p>Eleven thousand people crowded into a Tokyo sports arena today to pay respects to Keizo Obuchi, the prime minister of Japan, who died a month ago. Vietnam sent its deputy prime minister to the memorial service honoring Mr. Obuchi, who had been in the job two years before being replaced by Yoshiro Mori in April after suffering a stroke. Macao flew in its secretary for social affairs and culture. Sri Lanka was represented by Dhamasiri Senanayake, the minister for tourism and civil aviation.</p>
        <p>Sitting among them, in a dark suit with a solemn expression on his face, was a seriously jet-lagged Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's aides had not been unanimous about making the trip. There were suggestions to send Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. Mr. Gore was out of contention because of his campaign schedule. But Mr. Clinton had overruled the naysayers. He had wanted to remember Mr. Obuchi, who had visited the White House in May 1999, in a personal way. Samuel R. Berger, the president's national security adviser, had backed him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berger made the case that the event was important to the Japanese, and that they would remember a presidential snub long into the next administration. And other world leaders were attending: the prime ministers of Australia, Thailand and Malaysia, for instance, and the presidents of South Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia.</p>
        <p>So even though Mr. Clinton is planning a state visit to Japan next month, and even though he just returned from a trip to Portugal, Germany, Russia and Ukraine, and even though Japan is 13 hours away by plane, he sandwiched a trip to Tokyo into his week.</p>
        <p>It was not easy. He returned from Kiev on Monday night. He met with King Abdullah of Jordan at the White House on Tuesday. President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico was arriving for lunch on Friday. Mr. Clinton is off on Saturday for a commencement address in Minnesota. That left an opening, with just barely enough time to get to Tokyo, shake some hands, gulp down a spicy tuna roll and climb back aboard Air Force One.</p>
        <p>On this trip, Mr. Clinton roamed less on the plane than he usually does. Except for an intense card-playing session with the Air Force flight attendants in the galley, and another session with aides on the return trip in the conference room, Mr. Clinton spent the bulk of the trip retired to his room.</p>
        <p>Just a Sentimental Journey?</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton broke no records today with his jet-lag diplomacy. Back in 1994, he had traveled to Budapest and back in 24 hours, spending just seven hours on the ground. Before him, President Bush had jetted to and from Cartagena, Colombia, in the same day. And President Carter had flown to and from Tokyo for a meeting that was shorter than Mr. Clinton's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton looked as fresh as can be aside the other dark-suited leaders at the memorial service, thanks to a steward that keeps his clothes unwrinkled and an on-board shower. But all the hours in the air seemed to slow him.</p>
        <p>During his half-day in Japan, Mr. Clinton did sit down with Mr. Mori for a short conversation in the morning. President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea, who is preparing to meet with his North Korean counterpart for a summit meeting next week, briefed Mr. Clinton in the afternoon. But aides said again and again that this trip was not about pressing foreign policy interests, and they offered the brutal schedule as exhibit A of the affection Mr. Clinton had for Mr. Obuchi.</p>
        <p>''This whole trip, door to door, is about 36 hours,'' said a senior administration official, overestimating the length of the trip by a couple of hours. ''That highlights what the president is willing to do in order to personally be there for this commemorative event.''</p>
