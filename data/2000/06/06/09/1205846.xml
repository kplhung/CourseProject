        <p>A good king's throne is usurped by his evil brother. The dead monarch's young son realizes he must free the people from his uncle's tyranny. But the prince hesitates: does he have the courage to take the crown?</p>
        <p>These characters may sound familiar, but they are neither Danish royalty nor Disney lions. The story is ''The Little Lame Prince,'' a 19th-century children's tale by Dinah Maria Mulock Craik that Jonathon Ward and Greg Pliska have transformed into an intimate musical.</p>
        <p>If you thought the last thing the theater needed was another Hamlet-and-Claudius, Simba-and-Scar conflict, don't be deterred: now at the Abrons Arts Center, this adaptation shows why the book is justly considered a forgotten classic.</p>
        <p>Called ''Little Lame Prince and the Magic Cloak,'' the musical is set in Moorish Spain, where the boy hero, played alternately by Marshall Pailet and Michael Dunn, is shut in a tower, lonely and unable to walk.</p>
        <p>Tended by a devoted nurse (Rana Fellgraff), a horseman (Larry Purifory) and a disguised friend among the king's attendants (Venessa Maria Diaz), the prince doesn't know that he is royalty or that his storybook, its final pages oddly missing, is really recorded history.</p>
        <p>Children will delight in watching the young hero learn the truth and eventually gain the confidence to triumph over his buffoonish uncle (Sean Elias-Reyes) and his uncle's smug son (John Cencio Burgos).</p>
        <p>Mr. Ward has added humor to the play's book and lyrics without diminishing the poignancy of the prince's situation. Judd Silverman, the director, has also introduced some hilarious stage business: the king sings of his wickedness while brandishing his crown and sword as if they were a cane and a porkpie hat.</p>
        <p>The show, for ages 5 and over, also has fantasy elements, including shadow and rod puppets. Add Mr. Pliska's haunting melodies, and the story, like the best of fairy tales, seems as fresh as it is familiar.</p>
        <p>''Little Lame Prince and the Magic Cloak,'' through June 18 at the Henry Street Settlement Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 598-0400. Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $5. Reservations advised.</p>
        <p>Honored Guests</p>
        <p>Tomorrow children can follow in the footsteps -- the very small footsteps -- of a huge literary star.</p>
        <p>She is Eloise, the 6-year-old ''city child'' who lives in, or rather reigns over, the Plaza Hotel in Kay Thompson's famous storybooks. She will also preside, at least in spirit, over ''Eloise's Plaza,'' a children's walking tour sponsored by Friends of the Upper East Side Historic Districts, a preservation group.</p>
        <p>''I'll talk a little bit about the hotel's history and the architecture -- not too much, because it's geared to first through third graders,'' said Jane Cowan, an architectural educator who will lead the tour. She plans to say that the Plaza, built in 1905, was designed to look like a chateau.</p>
        <p>Then Ms. Cowan will give a dramatic reading of ''Eloise'' and show the group some of the hotel's rooms.</p>
        <p>''We'll go to the Palm Court and the Edwardian Room and the Oak Room,'' she said. ''Some of these are in the book, so it will be fun to look.''</p>
        <p>Later the children will have refreshments (Eloise, a fan of room service, would approve) and create hotel postcards. ''I'd like them to do a picture, either of the outside or of one of the rooms,'' Ms. Cowan said.</p>
        <p>The point is to pretend that they are Eloise, although presumably they won't get carried away and pour water down the Plaza's mail chute.</p>
        <p>''Eloise's Plaza,'' tomorrow from 10 a.m. to noon at the Plaza Hotel, 59th Street and Fifth Avenue. Admission: $10; children, $5; members of sponsoring organization, $8. Reservations required, (212) 535-2526.</p>
        <p>Disco Duck</p>
        <p>One trend in dramatizing fairy tales is to return to the grimness of the Brothers Grimm. The Vital Children's Theater Company, however, takes a different approach: although it retains the happy endings that small children find comforting, it injects contemporary references, comic twists, Hollywood music and opportunities for the audience to join in.</p>
        <p>Consider its latest production, ''Unwanted: The Very Ugly Duckling,'' by Michael Aman and Oscar E. Moore. In this New Age interpretation of Hans Christian Andersen, the hero, who hatches from an adopted egg, grows up to discover both his inner beauty and his birth mother.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, he is subjected to the usual torments by his vain sister (Lisa Catherine Clark) and a nosy hen (Heather E. Cunningham), who seems to be related to Chicken Little. When she sees the size of the adopted egg the mother duck (Megan Muckelmann) is incubating, she runs off squawking about an alien invasion.</p>
        <p>Poor Ted (his name is the last syllable of ''Unwanted''), played with appropriate pluck by Richard Guido, is always trying to avoid exposure, even asking for an audience volunteer to take his place at swim lessons. But he still manages to find himself center stage, whether it's in a confrontation with a hunter (Norm Isaksson, armed with a slingshot and a voice like Elmer Fudd's) or in a ballet that is a disco version of -- what else? -- ''Swan Lake.''</p>
        <p>Ted's self-image improves, and it's impossible not to cheer him on when he goes for Olympic gold as a synchronized swimmer. The company, expertly directed by Don Bill, deserves a medal, too.</p>
        <p>''Unwanted: The Very Ugly Duckling,'' Saturdays at 10:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. through July 1 at Vital Theater Company, 432 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 592-4508. Tickets: $10. Reservations advised.</p>
