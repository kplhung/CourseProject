        <p>Mika Salmi says that he is always a little cautious when venturing into the wilds of Hollywood from his Atomfilms home base in Seattle.</p>
        <p>''It's very fast in Hollywood,'' said Mr. Salmi, whose company produces short films on the Internet and sells them to outlets like airlines and shopping malls. ''People are always coming to us, trying to buy us. We're not anti-Hollywood. The key is just not to get caught by them.''</p>
        <p>Over the last year or so, the once separate and distinct worlds of old-line Hollywood and the dot-coms of the new economy have been intermingling with increasing urgency, taking their first faltering steps toward the coming age of digital entertainment, whatever that might turn out to be. While the major studios, conservative as always, are largely maintaining a discreet distance from the roiling waters of the Web, many entertainment executives, filmmakers, celebrities and talent agencies have been plunging head-first into the digital deep end.</p>
        <p>Hardly a week passes without the announcement of a new actor or director signing a deal with a dot-com to create exclusive digital films, or of a Hollywood insider proclaiming the acquisition or creation of a new venture.</p>
        <p>''You have so many people in Hollywood who know so much about their business that they convince themselves that they know about every business,'' said David Wertheimer, chairman of WireBreak.com, which emphasizes interactive entertainment on its Web site. ''They look at what's on the Web and they say, 'Hey, I can make better videos. I'll start my own dot-com.' They see so much attention and so much money going to these Internet guys and they think, 'Who's that pimply faced guy on the cover of Time Magazine? That's supposed to be me.' ''</p>
        <p>Hollywood has had to dodge or absorb a steady stream of challenges over the decades, from sound to color to television to videocassettes to independent films. Each one was predicted, at the time, to be the movie establishment's undoing. Yet each time, Hollywood not only persevered, but, eventually, overcame the threat. Now, while that may well happen again, many are wondering whether the hidebound studios have finally found an adversary they will be unable to dominate.</p>
        <p>To Joe Roth -- a longtime movie executive who left the top job at Walt Disney Studios last year to start the just-introduced Revolution Studios, an independent production company, and who is also involved in two Internet ventures -- the issue is just that stark. ''When all of this resolves itself,'' he asks, ''who will be occupying the top tier?''</p>
        <p>In other words, will the entertainment conglomerates own the dot-coms or -- as in the case of the America Online acquisition of Time Warner -- will the dot-coms own the entertainment conglomerates?</p>
        <p>''I think this is definitely a time of confusion and opportunity,'' said Larry Kasanoff, a longtime feature-film producer whose Threshold Entertainment includes a dot-com operation aimed at attracting young males with a combination of sophomoric sitcoms, video-game sagas and models in bikinis. ''Is this period going to be long enough that a bunch of dot-com start-ups will have time to get established? I don't know. I think, five years from now, we'll look back and a lot of these dot-coms will have been absorbed by the big studios. Others will have been able to use this confusion time to take their place in the landscape. We intend to be one of those.''</p>
        <p>The new entertainment dot-coms fall into a number of categories. Some offer so-called streaming video, usually live-action and animated shorts on the Internet, with a smattering of games and chat rooms and varying degrees of interactivity. Others are more business-to-business sites, connecting filmmakers with agents, with projects or with each other. Some are digital laboratories, aiming for a niche audience and, through the success or failure of their programming, providing an incubator for future movie and television projects. And many are just flat-out marketing tools, dedicated to the glories of a particular film or image-conscious celebrity.</p>
        <p>As might be expected in a business where celebrity is the hottest commodity, many of the Hollywood dot-coms have been trying to outdo one another by signing up major actors and filmmakers. Shockwave.com, which creates Web-based animation software as well as maintaining its own destination site, has signed deals with filmmakers like James Brooks and David Lynch. Z.com, among whose backers is the manager turned mogul Brad Grey of Basic Entertainment, has signed deals with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer and the director Oliver Stone. And there are dozens of others.</p>
        <p>The invasion of the dot-coms has been, as far as Hollywood is concerned, a relatively recent phenomenon. ''If you look back to early 1999, there were maybe six or seven Internet sites offering streaming video in one form or another,'' said Rick Hess, president of Propaganda Films, which makes theatrical features as well as digital entertainment for the Web. ''Today, there are maybe 75, and that number is going up. But everyone figures that, down the road, when the dust settles, there will only be maybe a dozen of them left.''</p>
        <p>Those in the Hollywood mainstream who have been counseling caution feel somewhat vindicated by the failure of recent Internet initial public offerings, and the precipitous drop in high-tech stock prices. And few can contain their delight at the collapse, last month, of one of the highest-profile of the entertainment dot-coms, the Digital Entertainment Network, even though its financial troubles were largely attributed to its profligate spending rather than to a flaw in the overall strategy of streaming video over the Internet.</p>
        <p>No one in Hollywood expects that the venture will be the last entertainment dot-com to fail, and much of the discussion in recent weeks has been about which will go next.</p>
        <p>''I've detected a real change,'' Mr. Wertheimer said, as people have reacted to the one-two punch of the Nasdaq plummet in April and the collapse of the DEN. Many of the players who were poised to jump into the dot-com waters have decided to pull back, or wait a little longer, he said, and some of those who are already in up to their eyeballs are getting a lot more cautious.</p>
        <p>''I think that this may turn out to be Hollywood's Vietnam, with a lot of people rushing into this without a clear idea of why they're getting in,'' Mr. Wertheimer said. ''We're going to see a lot of people retreating and declaring victory.''</p>
        <p>Handicapping the field has been particularly difficult, in part because there is no clear picture of where this is all headed and because so many of these new entertainment dot-coms have shifted their strategies in recent months in the face of rapidly changing technologies, increased competition and growing investor nervousness.</p>
        <p>Ifilm, initially based in San Francisco and one of the early leaders, began as a site where filmmakers could post their digital shorts and try to find an audience. Now, it is based in Los Angeles and offers not only its own stable of shorts but also serves as a portal with easy-click access to digital entertainment all over the Web.</p>
        <p>Pop.com, an Internet partnership between Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks and Ron Howard and Brian Grazer of Imagine Entertainment, was announced with a lot of fanfare last October as a site that would be up and running this spring, offering original short ''pops'' of entertainment featuring some of Hollywood's top performers and filmmakers. But Pop.com is still not online and there are reports that its principals are retooling their Internet strategy.</p>
        <p>When this wave of dot-coms took off, much of the initial momentum was toward building so-called destination sites, aimed at grabbing and holding an audience, preferably the 12-to-24-year-old males who drive so much of popular entertainment. Now, however, with a lot of destinations but with a scarcity of things to watch there, many of the new start-ups and some of the older ones have turned their attention elsewhere. Several companies have announced, or intend to announce soon, that they will spend more time and energy on creating content for others' sites than for themselves.</p>
        <p>No one has a real clue where all this will end. ''We are in the middle, right now, of speeding toward some future unknown environment,'' said Morgan Rector, president of the Imperial Bank Entertainment Group, one of the financial institutions most active in underwriting feature films.</p>
        <p>The Hollywood establishment is worried that with the Internet offering the promise of new ways to distribute movies while also competing for eyeballs and entertainment dollars, the new order might well upset longstanding financial arrangements. And, just as significantly, there are worries that what has happened to the pop music business -- with songs being swapped and pirated on the Internet beyond the reach of record company accountants -- will happen with movies, too, if firm protections are not put in place fast.</p>
        <p>The dot-coms, meanwhile, worry about being transformed into just another division of a profit-hungry global media conglomerate that will prevent them from expanding and exploding outdated entertainment concepts. ''They always said that Hollywood runs on fear and greed, and it's definitely true,'' Mr. Salmi said. ''The greed kicks in when they look at all the dot-com millions. The fear is, 'Oh my gosh, we'd better act quickly or we'll miss something big.' ''</p>
        <p>To some, there is a bit of a lemming-like quality to the way so many independent producers and former studio bosses have announced the formation of their own start-ups, as though having a dot-com in your roster of in-house activities is now as essential as getting the best table at Spago or the Grill.</p>
        <p>''In a way, it's like, if you don't have that as part of your dialogue over lunch at the Grill, then you're not with it,'' Mr. Hess said.</p>
        <p>Hollywood is meeting the dot-coms in a variety of ways. Each of the major studios has its own in-house Web operation. Some, like Warner Brothers Entertaindom.com or Sony's Station.com offer original entertainment and games. Others, however, are simply marketing devices for coming releases.</p>
        <p>But the heavy action has been in Internet start-up companies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth, for instance, has hired John Hegeman, one of the people responsible for the successful ''Blair Witch Project'' Internet marketing campaign, to create Distantcorners.com, a site specializing in horror and science fiction. And he bought a substantial interest in Mediatrip.com, which his Revolution Studios intends to use as a marketing tool for his feature films and as an incubator for new characters and offbeat stories.</p>
        <p>Robert Cooper, former head of production at DreamWorks, recently announced the creation of a new Internet start-up, which will be aimed at creating digital content for a variety of Web sites.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in interviews with more than a dozen top entertainment executives, every one had either started his own dot-com, bought an interest in somebody else's, or claimed he was just waiting for the perfect moment to announce a new dot-com strategy.</p>
        <p>There is more here, they all insisted, than smoke and mirrors. ''I believe it,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''I'm betting my money on it.''</p>
