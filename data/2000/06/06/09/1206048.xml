        <p>The smell of barbecue, the amplified boom of heavy metal and guys being guys. It was a typical tailgate party at the Continental Arena. But as the fans set up Hibachis in the parking lot, there was something different in the air, an atmosphere seldom felt before the start of a Devils game: desperation for tickets.</p>
        <p>Hours before the team faced the Dallas Stars in Game 5 tonight, in what would be a 1-0 loss in triple overtime, dozens of people milled about, anxiously calling out for spare tickets. One man's sign offered to trade four Yankees box seats for a single ticket. Another fan said he would pay any price and add his first-born son.</p>
        <p>Andy Ness of Neptune, N.J., surveyed the scene and was clearly pleased. After years of suffering the jeers of friends and the lonely nights sitting through dismally attended home games, the growing panic around him was satisfying.</p>
        <p>''We're finally getting the respect we deserve,'' said the 26-year-old Ness, his face streaked with black and red paint. ''It's about time.''</p>
        <p>But even though the Devils are in the cup finals, their fans still crave for recognition and respect. ''Were so overshadowed by the Rangers and the Flyers,'' said Rich Downey, 30, a computer analyst from South Brunswick. ''It's so infuriating.''</p>
        <p>Craig Coccaro, 24, a native Jerseyite who now lives in Philadelphia, has had to put up with endless taunts from friends and co-workers for being a Devils fan.</p>
        <p>''They're all jealous now,'' he said. ''They wish they lived in Jersey.''</p>
