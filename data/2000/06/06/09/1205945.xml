        <p>PITY, isn't it, about John Rocker?</p>
        <p>Not that the loopy pitcher for the Atlanta Braves was sent down to the minor leagues this week because of his wild arm and even wilder mouth. It is a pity that New Yorkers have to find a new whipping boy to show the world how virtuous they are.</p>

        <p>PITY, isn't it, about John Rocker?</p>
        <p>Not that the loopy pitcher for the Atlanta Braves was sent down to the minor leagues this week because of his wild arm and even wilder mouth. It is a pity that New Yorkers have to find a new whipping boy to show the world how virtuous they are.</p>
        <p>Nothing makes people feel better about themselves than a lout just begging to be denounced. For every right-thinking New Yorker, Mr. Rocker has been the perfect foil since the infamous Sports Illustrated interview in which he insulted just about everyone in this city, especially gays, immigrants, unwed mothers and riders of the No. 7 train.</p>
        <p>Never mind that this young man shows signs of being an ace and a king short of an emotional full deck. He expressed impure thoughts, and, for some, that makes him unworthy of compassion. The unforgiving include sports fans who are models of understanding when it comes to athletes who have raped women, beaten their wives, choked their coaches, drag-raced at homicidal speeds along city streets and snorted enough cocaine to keep Colombia afloat for the next 35 years.</p>
        <p>With the Braves scheduled to come to town late this month, some fans were getting ready to greet Mr. Rocker in that special way that makes New York a synonym for quiet good taste. They circulated fliers declaring June 29 to be ''John Rocker Battery Night.'' For those unfamiliar with this ritual, fans were urged to hurl batteries -- not your puny triple A's but hefty, welt-raising D's -- at the pitcher's head, to prove what models of tolerance New Yorkers can be.</p>
        <p>It now looks as if they will have to find another way to parade their virtue. Mr. Rocker, whose pitching has been as erratic as his behavior, was forced to report yesterday to a Braves minor league affiliate. He will probably not be headed to Shea Stadium any time soon.</p>
        <p>To repeat, what a pity for New York fans. Some vented their frustration (to any reporter foolish enough to listen) over being deprived of the warm glow of self-congratulation that comes with being able to scream obscenities at an obvious target.</p>
        <p>In fairness, baseball fans are not alone in their fondness for feel-good gestures. The New York City Council has proved itself rather adept in this regard.</p>
        <p>THIS week, it overwhelmingly approved a resolution attacking the National Rifle Association's plans to open a restaurant in Times Square, a part of Midtown that, speaking of quiet good taste, offers a restaurant with a wrestling theme.</p>
        <p>Does the resolution mean anything in practical terms? No more than a Council appeal a few months ago for the release of 13 Iranian Jews charged with spying for Israel. Somehow, Iran managed to put those people on trial anyway. Charlton Heston seems no more worried than the ayatollahs about incurring the Council's wrath. But at least the lawmakers got a chance to feel nice about themselves.</p>
        <p>So did the New York State Senate, which passed a hate crimes bill this week after rejecting it for years, mainly because it included gays in the ranks of those citizens deemed in need of special protection. Senate Republicans were finally able to overcome their queasiness about putting gays among the chosen. It couldn't have had anything to do with election-year worries about preserving their majority, could it?</p>
        <p>Once, as expected, the Senate and the Assembly agree on a compromise bill and the governor signs it, criminals will face added penalties if they single out victims on the basis of sex, race, religion, sexual orientation, age, national origin or disability.</p>
        <p>Will that put hatemongers on the run?</p>
        <p>As far as New York City goes, so-called bias crimes have been declining even without such a law. They dropped 24 percent from 1996 to 1999. There was a slight rise in the first five months of 2000, due almost entirely to a spate of church desecrations in Brooklyn, which seemed to end after the arrest of a suspect last month.</p>
        <p>For sure, the New York law will not silence its critics. They dismiss such measures as palliatives that may sound fine but that, among their other failings, mock the concept of equal protection under the law while penalizing defendants extra hard for the crime of harboring thoughts that society deems unacceptable.</p>
        <p>''This is way beyond Orwell,'' said the writer Nat Hentoff, who has long opposed hate crimes bills. But they do make some people feel good, he agreed, almost as good as aiming a D battery at a pitcher with sawdust for brains.</p>
