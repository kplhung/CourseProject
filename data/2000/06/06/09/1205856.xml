        <p>The elements that make up a successful bistro can be combined in all sorts of ways. Food, decor and atmosphere can intersect anywhere on the graph, which is why the bistro may be the most flexible, satisfying restaurant form ever invented.</p>
        <p>Jarnac and La Tour could not be more different. But both are instantly recognizably as bistros. La Tour, which opened on the the Upper East Side about a year and a half ago, feels more French, and not because of its corny Eiffel Tower logo. The staff is French; the chef, Pierre Rougey, is French (Breton, actually); and the two Breton owners, Jacky Boulay and Arnand Nael, understand that they are the ones who must set the proper bistro tone, greeting guests, making sure they settle in comfortably, offering them a free after-dinner drink if the mood strikes and in the best of all possible bistro worlds, adding some peculiar touches to the decor.</p>

        <p>The elements that make up a successful bistro can be combined in all sorts of ways. Food, decor and atmosphere can intersect anywhere on the graph, which is why the bistro may be the most flexible, satisfying restaurant form ever invented.</p>
        <p>Jarnac and La Tour could not be more different. But both are instantly recognizably as bistros. La Tour, which opened on the the Upper East Side about a year and a half ago, feels more French, and not because of its corny Eiffel Tower logo. The staff is French; the chef, Pierre Rougey, is French (Breton, actually); and the two Breton owners, Jacky Boulay and Arnand Nael, understand that they are the ones who must set the proper bistro tone, greeting guests, making sure they settle in comfortably, offering them a free after-dinner drink if the mood strikes and in the best of all possible bistro worlds, adding some peculiar touches to the decor.</p>
        <p>La Tour's menu is basic. You can start the meal with gazpacho; an endive salad with haricots verts, Roquefort cheese and walnuts; or poached skate on a bed of frisee with lime-orange dressing. Steak frites, in three different cuts, come with bearnaise, Roquefort, green-pepper or bordelaise sauce. Mussels loom large. They come steamed in white wine, or served up with ground mustard, onions and fresh thyme. Every Monday is all-you-can-eat moules-frites night, a $15 binge opportunity. No one will confuse La Tour with la Tour d'Argent. But the Paris landmark does not have old photos of French film stars, or La Tour's collection of 1940's and 50's ceramic water jugs that Ricard and Suze used to place in French bars to promote their liqueurs.</p>
        <p>Jarnac, just over three months old, sits on a quiet corner at the fringe of the meatpacking district. When the windows are thrown open, it's a cozy spot that allows diners to watch the world walk by while they drink house wine by the carafe. The restaurant is named after the famous town in the Cognac district, where the owner and maitre d'hotel, Tony Powe, grew up. Mr. Powe, who used to manage Chez Bruce in London, has signed up Maryann Terillo, formerly of Cafe de la Gare, as chef, and she has developed a quirky menu that flits back and forth between old classics like veal Marengo and braised rabbit chasseur, and contemporary dishes like curried red lentil soup and roast confit of duck with rhubarb and ginger chutney. Just a few blocks south of Pastis, here's a restaurant where absolutely no one turns to look when a new face comes through the door.</p>
        <p>La Tour, 1319 Third Avenue, near 76th Street, Manhattan; (212) 472-7578. Dinner entrees, $14.50 to $28.95.</p>
        <p>Jarnac, 328 West 12th Street, West Village; (212) 924-3413. Dinner entrees, $19.50 to $22.50.</p>
