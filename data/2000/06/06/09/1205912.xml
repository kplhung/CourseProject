        <p>When a House committee released thousands of pages of Justice Department documents on Tuesday about Democrats' fund-raising activities, the papers included some that cast a new and more forgiving light on the activities of Bernard L. Schwartz, a top Democratic Party contributor and the chairman and chief executive officer of Loral Space and Communications, a satellite company.</p>
        <p>For years, Mr. Schwartz, who contributed about $1.5 million in 1996, has lingered under a shadow of a Justice Department investigation. That was because Mr. Schwartz's donations to the Democratic Party came as Loral was seeking White House support for a waiver that would allow the company to export satellite technology to China. The inquiry into Mr. Schwartz was not closed until 1999.</p>

        <p>When a House committee released thousands of pages of Justice Department documents on Tuesday about Democrats' fund-raising activities, the papers included some that cast a new and more forgiving light on the activities of Bernard L. Schwartz, a top Democratic Party contributor and the chairman and chief executive officer of Loral Space and Communications, a satellite company.</p>
        <p>For years, Mr. Schwartz, who contributed about $1.5 million in 1996, has lingered under a shadow of a Justice Department investigation. That was because Mr. Schwartz's donations to the Democratic Party came as Loral was seeking White House support for a waiver that would allow the company to export satellite technology to China. The inquiry into Mr. Schwartz was not closed until 1999.</p>
        <p>A month ago, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, suggested at a hearing that the former head of the Justice Department's campaign finance unit, Charles G. La Bella, had, in a 1998 memorandum to Attorney General Janet Reno, urged the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate Mr. Schwartz's dealings with President Clinton.</p>
        <p>But Mr. La Bella's memorandum of July 16, 1998, and an addendum on Aug. 12, 1998, cast a fuller light on the matter. The documents, which were made public by the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, show that Mr. La Bella never believed there was any evidence against Mr. Schwartz and concluded that Mr. Schwartz had not broken the law.</p>
        <p>''This was a matter which likely did not merit any investigation,'' Mr. La Bella wrote in his addendum. Portions of Mr. La Bella's memorandums about Mr. Schwartz were first reported by The Los Angeles Times.</p>
        <p>Today, a Loral spokesman expressed satisfaction that the documents had finally come to light. ''We are pleased that the facts in this case have now been made public and that Mr. Schwartz and Loral are shown to be innocent of any wrongdoing,'' said Thomas B. Ross, a company vice president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Specter said in an interview that he did not realize at the hearing that Mr. Schwartz had been exonerated by the Justice Department because he had not seen Mr. La Bella's addendum. ''When I was questioning him it was from his initial report,'' Mr. Specter said. ''I did not know at that time there was a supplemental report.''</p>
        <p>In his first report Mr. La Bella suggested that the justification for the inquiry into Mr. Schwartz was based not on evidence but on the concerns of Justice Department officials that they could be criticized if they did not investigate.</p>
        <p>Mr. La Bella wrote, ''Although no one could articulate a solid basis upon which to predicate a criminal investigation, given the political climate, it was generally felt that the department had to commence an investigation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. La Bella said in an interview that he never believed that there was concrete evidence against Mr. Schwartz. He said he cited the matter in his memorandum because of what he had concluded was a double standard in which the Justice Department began an inquiry into Mr. Schwartz over the contributions but refused to open an investigation of President Clinton.</p>
