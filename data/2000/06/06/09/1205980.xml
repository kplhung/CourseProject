        <p>The Senate approved a measure today to require the growing number of tax-exempt groups that now secretly raise and spend unlimited sums on political activities to disclose their contributors and spending.</p>
        <p>Today's surprising vote on the legislation sponsored by Senator John McCain is the first since 1993 in which the Senate has approved a significant tightening of campaign finance laws.</p>
        <p>There are scores of the new tax-exempt groups, like those affiliated with the Sierra Club and organizations with close ties to Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip. These secretive groups raise money, buy television and radio advertisements, conduct polling, work on issues and engage in other political activities.</p>
        <p>The vote today could give unexpected momentum to a similar measure on which the House will vote on Friday, despite opposition from Republican leaders. The Senate's decision could also enhance the prospects for Mr. McCain's proposed ban on unrestricted donations, called soft money.</p>
        <p>On today's decisive procedural motion, senators refused by a vote of 57 to 42 to defeat the measure, a margin that surprised even Mr. McCain and his chief Democratic allies, Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. In an embarrassing rebuke to Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader who opposed the provision, 14 Republicans voted with 43 Democrats.</p>
        <p>''This is not the end, this is the beginning,'' said Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican, ebullient after his triumph.</p>
        <p>In a vote on a second major issue, senators defeated a sweeping bill to overhaul the nation's managed care system. The vote, 51 to 48, was largely along party lines, with most Republicans opposing the measure and all 44 Democrats supporting it.</p>
        <p>Some supporters said the vote could doom all hope this year for Congress to pass bipartisan legislation on managed care. Senate and House negotiators have been stalled for months on hammering out a compromise. But Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, vowed that backers would ''keep trying.''</p>
        <p>Both the managed care and campaign finance measures were permitted as amendments to a $310 billion Pentagon budget bill to help restore political peace in the Senate.  For the last few weeks, the Senate had been locked in a battle over how to conduct its business, highlighted by a shouting match on the floor between Mr. Lott and Mr. Daschle.</p>
        <p>When the Senate returned this week from a 10-day recess, the two leaders seemed chastened by the gridlock and have been working to patch up their differences. But it is a fragile peace.</p>
        <p>''We both understand that we have got a job to do,'' Mr. Daschle told reporters before today's votes. ''We have to run the Senate in a way that accommodates not only our caucus interests, but the interests of the country.''</p>
        <p>Today's vote displayed a new tack by Mr. McCain and his allies to translate his new national prominence from his unsuccessful presidential race into traction on his signature issue of overhauling the campaign finance system.</p>
        <p>By seizing on a device used by groups large and small, liberal and conservative, that try to avoid the donor disclosure laws, Mr. McCain picked an issue that could not be challenged on constitutional grounds, like his proposed ban on unrestricted donations called soft money.</p>
        <p>The measure requires a growing number of political organizations formed under an obscure part of the Internal Revenue Code known as Section 527 to follow federal campaign law and file tax returns and disclose a list of their contributors and expenditures.</p>
        <p>Section 527 was created in 1975, after the Watergate scandal, to establish tax rules for political organizations, like the national political parties and political action committees. But unlike these new secretive groups, parties and PAC's register with the Federal Election Commission, which requires them to disclose their donors and spending.</p>
        <p>In an e-mail message sent today to 200,000 of his supporters nationwide, Mr. McCain tried to tap into the same fervor that propelled his candidacy.</p>
        <p>''You stood by my side throughout our quest for the White House,'' Mr. McCain said. ''Now today, I am asking for your help to fight one more battle. As you can imagine, this move is being vehemently opposed by the big money fat cats who have grown quite comfortable throwing their millions around in secret.''</p>
        <p>Senator Feingold said after the vote, ''There's no question that John McCain's campaign had a lot to do with what happened today.''</p>
        <p>Critics of the bill mostly sidestepped a fight on the merits of the measure, retreating behind procedural arguments and dire warnings of damage to national security to oppose the bill.</p>
        <p>Two Senate Republicans, John W. Warner of Virginia and James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, praised the substance of Mr. McCain's amendment, but said its passage would doom the entire military bill.</p>
        <p>That was because the House Ways and Means Committee today warned that the amendment amounted to a revenue measure because it involved possible changes in the tax status of political groups. Under the Constitution, all revenue bills must originate in the House.</p>
        <p>''You'd have my vote,'' said Mr. Warner, chairman of the Armed Services Committee. ''But this amendment will torpedo this bill and send it to the bottom of the sea where only Davy Jones could resurrect it.''</p>
        <p>Clearly furious, Mr. McCain called the tactic ''a red herring'' that exposed Republicans' claims to be champions of campaign disclosure as hypocritical. ''The American people will see through this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Opponents' arguments backfired as supporters clearly were willing to take the risk that the House would return the bill without voting on it.  Several of the 14 Republicans who defied their leadership, including Senators Spencer Abraham of Michigan and Conrad Burns of Montana, have not supported changes in campaign finance law in the past, but face tough re-election races this fall.</p>
        <p>Today's vote still faces the possible constitutional challenge in the House. Mr. McCain said if the bill was returned, the campaign finance measure could be stripped off and attached to another bill. Mr. McCain said he was open to a suggestion made by Mr. Lott after the vote to negotiate an even broader disclosure amendment that could withstand House scrutiny.</p>
        <p>Those talks will take place in the next few days. Until then, today's action stands as senators' most significant action on campaign finance law since a Democrat-controlled Senate in 1993 approved a bipartisan tightening of several aspects of campaign finance law.</p>
        <p>Senate Democrats were also instrumental in forcing today's vote on the managed care legislation. They persuaded four Republicans to side with them -- two more than last year -- and fell only one vote short of passage, taking into consideration an absent Democrat.</p>
        <p>''This is the clearest message that we are going to get a bill this year,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who shepherded the bill through the floor today.</p>
        <p>Today's bill was identical to the one passed by the House with bipartisan support last October. It would give patients the right to sue their health maintenance organizations and would set uniform national standards for health insurance. The Senate passed its own Republican-sponsored version last July, offering fewer protections to fewer people, two important differences that have proved insurmountable so far to House and Senate negotiators.</p>
        <p>Senator Kennedy called the negotiations a charade and said the two sides have made such little progress in reaching a compromise that Democrats felt compelled to force the House bill on the floor. President Clinton also weighed in today, expressing disappointment with the Senate vote.</p>
        <p>But Senate Republicans, infuriated by the Democrats' course of action, called the move a political ploy and said it all but doomed bipartisan legislation for the year. Instead, Republicans said they would draft their own bill and pass it with Republican votes if they had to, even if that meant Mr. Clinton would veto it.</p>
        <p>Most Senate Republicans dislike the House bill, which is opposed by the insurance industry, saying it would lead to runaway lawsuits, raise premiums and put employers out of business. They would like a bill narrower in scope, one that would restrict lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Democrats counter that the patients' ability to sue is critical to making health maintenance organizations accountable for their decisions. They say they will continue to negotiate and will try to force the issue back on the floor, if need be. The American Medical Association backs the House bill.</p>
        <p>Framing today's defeat as a victory, Democrats say they are now one vote short of success. And by forcing Republicans to vote on the bill, they hope to be able to portray them on the campaign trail as beholden to the insurance industry and unwilling to address consumer concerns about managed care.</p>
        <p>''If we really want a bill, Republicans are going to have to write this bill and pass it,'' said Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican and one of the negotiators. ''The Democrats want a political issue.''</p>
        <p>How Senate Voted on Bill</p>
        <p>Following is the roll-call vote of 57 to 42 by which the Senate allowed a vote on Senator John McCain's campaign spending amendment, which then passed on a voice vote.
