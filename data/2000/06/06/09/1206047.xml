        <p>The Stanley Cup playoffs began two months ago, and no player has had a bigger impact on the postseason than Scott Stevens, the captain of the Devils.</p>
        <p>The 36-year-old defenseman has been an intimidating presence along the blue line, shutting down such feared snipers as Florida's Pavel Bure (1 goal), Toronto's Mats Sundin (0 goals) and Philadelphia's John LeClair (0 goals). Going into Game 5, Dallas's Brett Hull (2 goals) and Mike Modano (0 goals) have not fared much better against Stevens.</p>
        <p>Despite playing against the opposition's top forwards, Stevens went into Game 5 game at Continental Arena a plus-9. Stevens, not known as a scoring threat in the regular season (8 goals in 78 games) has also contributed offensively in the postseason. He scored the team's first goal of the playoffs against Florida and the decisive goal in Game 2 of that series. He did not score against Toronto or Philadelphia, but scored the game-winner against Dallas in the opener of the finals.</p>
        <p>In Game 5, in a contest dominated by goaltenders and defensemen, the Stars defeated the Devils, 1-0, in triple overtime, in a game that ended this morning to send the series back to Dallas on Saturday. Stevens drew roars from the capacity crowd at Continental Arena when he crushed Hull at the Devils' blue line in the second minute of the third period.</p>
        <p>Stevens was a tower of strength in his zone, taking the body and denying any second chances by the Stars by clearing the puck. While Martin Brodeur was the best player for the Devils, Stevens played the most minutes by anyone going into the third overtime.</p>
        <p>There is a large segment of Devils followers that believes that Stevens should have been the postseason most valuable player in 1995, when the Devils captured their first Stanley Cup in 1995. Instead, the Conn Smythe trophy went to Claude Lemieux, who scored 13 goals in the postseason.</p>
        <p>Along with his teammates vigorously seeking to erase the stigma of failing to make the playoffs the year after winning the Stanley Cup and bitter first-round exits the past three seasons, Stevens was often blamed for failing to provide leadership.</p>
        <p>Coach Larry Robinson, the winner of the Conn Smythe trophy in 1978, when he won one of his six Stanley Cups with the Montreal Canadiens, was aware of that criticsm and addressed it immediately after he replaced Robbie Ftorek as coach with eight games left in the regular season and the team in disarray.</p>
        <p>''The first thing I did when I took over was straighten out the notion in the past that Scottie was the captain and we had no leader,'' Robinson said. ''Leadership is shown on the ice and when our team needed a lift, it was Scottie who made the big hit, it was Scottie that sacrificed his body.''</p>
        <p>Players such as Ken Daneyko and Bobby Holik said that the turning point in sweeping the Detroit Red Wings in the 1995 finals was the crunching hit Stevens delivered on Slava Kozlov in Game 2.</p>
        <p>The ferocious blindside check on Eric Lindros in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals was not as crunching as the one on Kozlov, but it had the same effect. It took the life out of the Flyers and rallied the Devils, who faced elimination three times against the Flyers.</p>
        <p>Stevens simply played like a man possessed in these playoffs because he wanted the Stanley Cup, in the words of his wife, Donna, ''more than anything.''</p>
        <p>Stevens explained his drive to the title to being 36 and this might be his last chance to raise hockey's ultimate prize.</p>
        <p>''You take things for granted when you're younger,'' Stevens said. ''When you're young, you think you've got lots of time, but you learn as you go on that you have to make the best of every opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Daneyko had another explanation for his captain's intense desire.  ''He's taken some flak about leadership and about the way he played in the playoffs after we won in 1995,'' Daneyko said. ''He took it to heart and he wanted to change people's opinion about him, show people that he is a true leader.''</p>
        <p>''I'm the biggest fan of Scott Stevens,'' Holik said. ''I've always said he should have won the Norris trophy.'' The award goes to the league's best defenseman.</p>
