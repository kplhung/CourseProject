        <p>In its eagerness to persuade Russia to accept deployment of a U.S. missile defense, the Clinton administration has all but ignored China, a nuclear power in its own right and an opponent of these systems.</p>
        <p>China currently fields about 20 nuclear-armed missiles capable of striking the continental United States. For decades, it has relied on this small force not only to deter a nuclear attack, but also to guarantee it a place at the table with the other great powers and to offset their conventional weaponry. In a conflict, even the limited, 100-interceptor missile defense being pursued by the Clinton administration would be able to counter China's entire strategic nuclear arsenal.</p>
        <p>To many critics of the Communists in Beijing, this sounds like an excellent idea. But China could not be expected to sit idly by. Its intentions have never been easy to read, but one point comes through in its foreign policy statements: China must never again be subjected to the humiliation that stronger powers inflicted on it in the past. Nuclear weapons are its protection against such disgrace.</p>
        <p>Unlike North Korea and the other rogue states that would be the primary focus of an American missile defense, China is capable of compensating by arming its missiles with multiple warheads and adding sophisticated countermeasures to confuse our defensive system.</p>
        <p>True, China will modernize its nuclear arms to some degree no matter what we do; the missiles it has now are antiquated and impossible to launch quickly. But modernization is different from expansion. An American missile defense would encourage China to develop a larger, more flexible nuclear force and to put that force on alert.</p>
        <p>China is currently debating what role nuclear weapons should play in its security policy: the size and structure of its force and the principles that should govern its use. Neither the administration nor the Republicans seem concerned about how our actions on missile defense might influence that debate. But as the presidential race heats up and the administration moves toward a deployment decision, missile defense proponents must explain why obviating a potential threat from a handful of third-rate states is worth increasing the certain threat from an established nuclear power.</p>
