        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free.  *denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>*ANNE ALBERS, Jewish Museum, Fifth avenue at 92nd Street, (212)423-3200 (through Aug. 20). This survey of arguably the most influential textile artist of the 20th-century is part retrospective, part weaving seminar, part biography - and altogether fascinating. It traces the development of Albers's work from her student days at the Bauhaus to Black Mountain College, were she taught wit her husband, Josef. It contrasts her designs for commercial fabrics, which emphasized structure and materials in new ways, with her pictorially striking handloomed pieces. A gallery of photographs, letters, personal memorabilia and pre-Columbian textile fragments she collected reflects her character and quietly galmorous personal style. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Tuesdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50, students and senior citizens; free for children under 12 (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>*WILLIAM MERRITT CHASE, ''Modern American Landscapes, 1886-1890,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000 (throug Aug. 13). Chase (1849-1916) had a long, distinguished run as a painter, teacher and art politician. But this show zeroes in on the five-year period when, in a trasitional phase between the brown, murky tones of his Munich training and his arrival at a lighter style based on french Impressionism, he painted genteel views of park landscapes in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Aside from their engaging scenic content, the 35 oils and pastels in the show are important because they are the first paintings in which an Impressionist style was used to depict American subjects. Recent examination corrected some errors about their locales. And new scholarly speculation on Chase's motives for painting them suggest that he wanted them to serve as examples of ''civilized urban landscapes'' that accorded with the European avant-garde model of modern life. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>*''EDWARD HOPPER, PRINTMAKERS,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3676 (through July 16). Before concentrating on paintings, Hopper (1882-1967) made prints from 1913 to 1923. In that decade he produced his first mature work a wonderful body of etchings that brought realism, emotion and a strong sense of the medium's potential to a field that had become more decorative than challenging. Using many of the motifs he was to pursue in his later paintings - nudes, loners, decrepit houses, night scenes, railroad trains - Hopper took full advantage of the intense moodiness a black-and-white etching can convey. The pervasive theme of loneliness and isolation for which he was noted is very much present in this show. The nearly 50 works here is a fine introduction to Hopper's basic themes, and gives a splendid idea of what he accomplished in the demanding etching medium. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50, students and the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''MAKING CHOICES, 1920-1960,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9480 (through Sept. 26). The main event at the Modern these days is the museum itself. This has been the case since last fall, when the project ''MOMA 2000'' began the first of what will be three successive top-to-bottom reinstallations of the permanent collection galleries. The affair has been billed as a test drive for the future, a chance for an institution to rethink the modern art tradition that it helped invent and to consider its own identity in what is often called a postmodern world. This second installment, which looks denser, weirder, messier and more truly modern (or maybe postmodern) than the first, is a big leap in the right direction. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''MASTERPIECES OF JAPANESE ART FROM THE MARY GRIGGS BURKE COLLECTION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710 (through June 25). The good news is this ravishing exhibition of Japanese art, ranging from Neolithic pottery to knee-weakening Edo-period screens with a breadth and depth rarly seen in New York. Even better news is that a large part of the collection from which these 200 works are drawn is a promised gift to the Met, placing it suddenly among the top five museums for Japanese art in the United States. The show includes Buddhist sculptures and mandals, monochrome ink paintings and calligraphy, hand scrolls and hanging scrolls as well as occasional but outstanding examples of ceramics and lacquerware. A specific Japanese sensibility, alternately refined and earthy, discreet and rambunctions, spiritual and cosmopolitan, and always astoundingly attuned to materials, is revealed here. Hours and admission: See above (Smith.)</p>
        <p>*''MICHELANGELO TO PICASSO: MASTER DRAWINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF THE ALBERTINA, VIENNA,'' Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through June 18). The Albertina, which has one fo the world's greatest collections of works on paper, houses 65,000 drawings and watercolors and nearly a million prints, from Gothic to contemporary. The small sampling of 45 drawings and watercolors here runs from Michelangelo to Jackson Pollock and includes many works that have never before left Austria. Standouts include Leonardo's ''Half-Length of an Apostle''; four drawings by Durer, including his ''Head of an Old Man'' (1521); Michelangelo's anatomical study ''Seated Male Nude With Two Arms''; and Raphael's ''Madonna and child.'' There are works by Rubens, Rembrandt, Poussin, Claude Lorrain, van Gogh, Picasso, Klimt, Schiele, Chagali and lesser-knowns. It isn't to often that one gets to see this range of masters packed into one small show, a fine teaser for the full Albertina experience. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''MAXFIELD PARRISH, 1870-1966,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000 (through Aug. 6). A romantic fabulist who painted in a tight, finicky mode that left out no detail, Parris (1870-1966) was a highly accomplished illustrator who could be considered the father of Norman Rockwell. As a more aspiring painter, he also pursued a never-never world of chaste but titillating young womena dn knightly menin pastoral landscapes that melded medieval towers with New England forests, Western gorges and the deep blue skies of fairy kingdoms. This show ofmore than 140 paintings, drawings, prints, illustrations and ephemera ranges from such well-known Parris chestnuts as ''Daybreak'' (1922), depicting a young woman's ecstatic awakening to an erotically symbolic Dawn, to his coy, cartoonish ''Old King Cole'' mural of 1894. Aside from its campy entertainment value, there is enough here - particularly his graphic art and some fine landscapes - to sustain the revival of interest in his work that bean with the Pop Art era. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''PERFECT DOCUMENTS: WALKER EVANS AND AFRICAN ART, 1935,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710 (throug Sept. 3). At first glance, the photographs of African scultpure taken by Evans (1903-1975) are a far cry from the intensely American depictions of places and people that made his reputation. But actually they are all of a piece, esthetically, with his other work. Symmetrically positioned and tightly cropped, with soft lighting that created no shadows, they preview the compressed compositional style he alter used. The 50 vintage images here - masks, figures, jewelry, utilitarian objects - are from the more than 450 Evans took to document the show ''African Negro Art'' at the Museum of Modern Art in 1935. The sculptures, of course, are remarkably photogenic; but Evans saw them for the masterpieces they are and conveyed their power with real devotion. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''1900: ART AT THE CROSSROADS,'' Solomon R. Guggeheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500 (through Sept. 10). A wacky exercise in historical simulation, the excuse being a new century. It si hard to remember the last time so many bad pictures were in one place at one time, unless you consider eBay a place. There is also a good deal of excellent art mixed in among the dogs, and sometimes what is best is not what you would expect, which is partly the show's point. We're mant to look anew at a moment 100 years ago when it was not yet clear who would be the pioneers in the 20th century and who would be forgotten. The show provides just enough compensatory rewards for its schlock quotient. The weak-hearted and modern-day cultural Pharisees may never get past the shock of confronting so much of the art that the abstractionists were rebelling against in a museum created as a shrine to 20th-century abstraction. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $7, students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''TREASURES FROM THE ROYAL TOMBS OF UR,'' Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212)685-0610 (through Sept. 10). The Sumerians flourished on third-millennium Mesopotamia, creating one of the earliest civilizations as they devised such essentials as writing, numbers, the wheel and irrigation methods. This sumptuous exhibition attests to their visual achievement with gold, silver and carved calcite vessels; weapons, tools and cylinder seals; and ingenious jewelry made of lapis Lazuli, carnelian and gold. On view as well are several of art history's most familiar, if least exhibited, masterpieces. All belong to the University of Pennsylvania and are part of one of archaeology's greatest discoveries: the intact, lavishly equipped royal tombs excavated at Ur in the 1920's by C. Leonard Woolley. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6, students and the elderly (Smith).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>JOHN BOWMAN, Winston Wachter Mayer, 39 East 78th street, (212)327-2526 (through June 30). Since the 1980's, Mr. Bowman has been using traditional painting styles to allegorie postmodernist historical and philosophical conundrums. More interesting conceptually than formally, his new paintings include ysterious images of Renaissance-style theater prosceniums teeming with Ensoresque faces, masks and gargoyles. In one we look out from the stage over a serene, autumnal forest. Maybe the empty stage signifies the end of master narratives (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>FREDERIC EDWIN CHURCH, ''In Search of the Promised Land,'' Berry-Hill, 11 East 70th Street, (212)744-2300 (through July 15). This sumptuous exhibition of 50 works, the largest in New York in nearly 30 years, spans most of Church's long career, offering opportunities to contrast his innate early talent with its maturation, is reverence for the American landscape with his depiction of exotic sites, ad his grand, sometimes gradoise finished statements with its small animated studies (Smith).</p>
        <p>''THE COLLECTOR AS PATRON IN THE 20TH CENTURY,'' Knoedler &amp; Co., 19 East 70th Street, (212)794-0550 (through July 31). This two-tiered exhibition honors American collectors present and past. Upstairs an exemplary selection from five private collections summarizes postwar American art. Downstairs a fascinating archival display of correspondence, photographs and color reporductions profiles 28 important American collections, tracing their impact on American museums and offering tantalizing glimpses of their dealings with Knoedler, the oldest living art gallery in New York (Smith).</p>
        <p>WILLEM DE KOONING, ''Mostly Women,'' Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212)744-2313 (through June 30). Dominated by de Kooning's lush, desheveled paintings and drawings of women from the middle 1960's, this show has the intimacy and excitement of a visit to the artist's studio. The works, from the collection of John and Kimiko Powers, come in all shapes and sizes and are executed on whatever's-handy surfaces - from paper towels to hollow-core doors. They are often affectionately inscribed by the artist (Smith).</p>
        <p>SETH MICHAEL FORMAN, Adam Baumgold, 128 East 72nd Street, (212)861-7338 (through June 24). Something odd happens in each of Mr. Forman's small, tenderly made oil paitings. A clown submits to execution by a man with a big axe. A creature with a bulbous, pink four-legged body and a man's head contemplates the jawbone of a large animal. These and other dreamlike events are staged in gloomily Romantic settings. They might represent stages on an inner journey of self-transformation (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>ROBERT BOURDEAU, ''Industrial Sites,'' Edwynn Houk, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212)750-7070 (through June 17). This is an impressive first New York solo show for an eminent Canadian photographer who was born in 1931 and studied with Minor White in the 1960's. More than 50 gold-toned black-and-white prints depict extravagantly run-down steel mills, quarries or grain elevators in American and Europe. Mr. Bourdeau's expertly composed images have a sad and awesome Piranesian grandeur (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ERIC GOULDER, ''Malthusian Visions,'' Forum, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212)355-4545 (through June 16). Mr. Goulder's brone sculputres hark back to 19th-century modes of monumental figuration. As this show's title suggests, his beefy wrestlers, Darwinian babies and compacted female nudes are supposed to allegorie the theme of overpopulation. If the sculptures looked as unlikely as the concept sounds, they might be interesting, but they are high-mindedly serious, unimaginative and formally bland (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleris: SoHo</p>
        <p>''ALL THINGS, EVERYTHING TRUE,'' CRG, 93 Grand Street, (212)996-4360 (through next Friday). It is hard to grasp the connecting theme but this is a good five-sculptor show. It includes Sam Durant's fake rocks broadcasting Southern Rock music; an amusing mirror trick with slugs by Michael Coughlan; a semi-architectural structure made from plastic pipe and drywall by Christie Frields; a pristine Minimalist box with faux-functional holes by Carl Bronson; and a beige vinyl sheet with curious geometric punctuations by Shirley Tse (Johnson).</p>
        <p>EDWIN SCHLOSSBERG, ''Figure: Ground,'' Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, (212)226-3232 (through June 17). Mr. Schlossberg shows a series of text works: rectangular brass sheets with cut-out Jasper Johns-style letters spelling out portentous phrases like ''being conscious becomes our destruction'' or ''awake through every wave.'' The brass sheets were also used to stencil black-and-white paper versions activated by graphic and gestural additions (Johnson).</p>
        <p>JEFFREY STURGES, Spencer Brownstone, 39 Wooster Street, (212)334-3455 (through or otherwise anonymous functional architecture is a common genre now, but Mr. Sturges gives it a compelling beauty in large, richly colored prints. Pictures of a brick wall sandwiched between deep blue sky and intensely green grass or of a well-lighted and clean pedestrian tunnel in Zurich are compositionally perfect and dreamily vivid (Johnson).</p>
        <p>THOMAS ZUMMER, Frederieke Taylor/TZ' Art Gallery, 470 Broome Street, (212)966-9059 (through July 16). A brainy conceptualist and skillful draftsman, Mr. ummer copies and manipulates found photographs to obliquely address issues of representation and mechanical reproduction. One apparently abstract piece is called ''Drawing of a Printout of a Superimposition of a Flight of Birds Upon Itself, Inverted To Determine the Range of Potential Collisions.'' A more accessible work depicts the United Nations building spinning at 45 r.p.m. (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>ROBERT BREER, AC Project Room, 453 West 17th Street, (212)645-4970 (through June 24). An original member of the 1960's group E.A.T. (Experiments in Art and Technology), Mr. Breer here presents vintage examples of one of his signature concepts: motoried Minimalist sculptures that move slowly and comically about as though they had lives of their own. A white Styrofoam square creeps purposefully across the floor; a rumpled silver blanket breathes; seven toy like black domes dragging eccentric linear trailers produce a constantly metamorphosing three-dimensional ''Floor Drawing'' (Johnson).</p>
        <p>HOVEY BROCK, Jeffrey Coploff, 526 West 26th street, (212)741-1149 (through June 17) Mr. Brock makes large, loopy watercolors of captivating subtlety. Using a wide brush and diluted paint on off-white panels or paper, he traces circulating, linear arabesques over and over, creating shimmering entanglements that seem to hover in space like knots of cosmic or submolecular energy (Johnson).</p>
        <p>DINO BRUZZONE, Kravets/Webby, 529 West 21st Street, (212)352-2238 (through June 17). This Argentine artist has put his architectural training to good use by building clunky models of actual industrial sites and making large color photographs of them. Blatantly artificial photographic simulationism is too common now, but Mr. Burzzone's mundane yet surreal pictures are compelling nevertheless (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ANNETTE DAVIDEK, Richard Anderson, 453 West 17th Street, (212)463-0970 (through June 17). Ms. Davidek's medium-size paintings of smeary biomorphic forms swimming in fields of layered color are not unfamiliar - one thinks of Terry Winters, Gerhard Richter, Ross Bleckner and other painters of the 80's and 90's - but they are conscientously made and, at their best, exude a subtly dissonant sensuousness (Johnson).</p>
        <p>LUCKY DEBELLEVUE, Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (212)675-7772 (through June 17). For his second New York solo, Mr. DeBellvue offers various underproduced works of Pop Arte Povera and three beautiful sculptures knit from colored pipe cleaners. The showstopper is a ballooning, helmet-shaped volume six feet across. Hanging in the middle of the gallery, its raspberry pink exterior deepened by an underlayer of dark orange and its flaring lower rim a bright marigold hue, it is stately, ridiculous and spectacularly lush (Johnson).</p>
        <p>WALTON FORD, Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212)563-4474 (through June 30). An impressive life-size watercolor of a rampaging Indian elephant dominates this exhibition. The galloping, sexually aroused pachyderm is rendered in faux-antique style on 22 separately framed pages assembled into one looming 12-by-18-foot rectangle. Curiously, the elephant has attracted doens of birds - owls, starlings, goldfinches, vultures, larks; they are meant to symbolize Western efforts to colonie India (Johnson).</p>
        <p>PAUL GEORGES, ''The Big Idea,'' Center for Figurative Painting, 115 West 30th Street, (212)868-3452 (through June 30). Although he has stayed with traditional subject matter - self-portraits, nudes, landscapes, flowers and mythological scenes - Mr. Georges brings a modernist outlook to it. This mini-retrospective of nearly 20 paintings in diverse styles reveals how he has brightened and lightened his palette over the years, tempering his affection for the old masters with the here and now. An example is an inviting self-portrait of 1989-90 whose welcoming informality is conveyed in a dazzlement of light and color. He is also a master at flower painting; his colorful blooms, in gardens or in vases, have a lusty freshness few contemporary painters can match (Glueck).</p>
        <p>ELLIOT GREEN, Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, (212)727-3323 (through June 24). Mr. Green's paintings look like Saturday morning cartoons filtered through a child's feverish delirium. Rubbery arms and legs, bizarrely swollen fingers, big scary shoes and sad, misshapen faces are packed into fragmented, emotionally charged scenarios. Yet even as they tap into elemental desires and anxieties, they remain works of great formal elegance, with carefully penciled serpentine lines, richly muted color and tightly interlocking, de Kooningesque compositions (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CHARLES MGILL, ''Club Negro,'' Barbara Ann Levy, 453 West 17th Street, (212)645-7810 (through June 17). Mr. McGill, an African-American artist who plays golf, has come up with a funny line of satiric mock-commodities for black golfers under the fictive label ''Club Negro.'' A faux-commercial display promotes new, Africanied golf balls like the ''New Spook'' (''If you can't beat them, scare them,'' reads the ad copy on the shelf) and the ''Malcom X,'' which is ''guaranteed to improve your game by any means necessary'' (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''TOPOLOGIES,'' White Box, 525 West 26th Street, (212)714-2347 (through June 17). Inaugurating this gallery's expansive new basement site, ''Topologies'' brings together six conceptualist approaches to arhitectural basics: a wall incision by William Anastasi; poetic text on a column by Lawrence Weiner; archetypal building blocks by Barry Le Va; a partial reconstruction of a Peruvian ruin by Osvaldo Romberg; a sound piece by Shelley Hirsch to animate the entry ramp; and a video projection by Maria Marshall to dissolve a wall (Johnson).</p>
        <p>JASON YOUNG, Cristinerose, 529 West 20th Street, (212)206-0297 (through June 17). Working more like a sculptor than a painter, Mr. Young pours, paints, layers, sands and otherwise tolls synethic resin on medium-sie panels, producing sleek, biomorphically patterned abstractions. At once repellently plastic and seductively tactile, they exude - and perhaps critique - the vacant allure of industrialized decoration (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>''CLOCKWORK 2000,'' P.S. 1 National and International Studio Program 1999-2000, Clocktower Gallery, 108 Leonard Street, between Broadway and Lafayette Streets, Lower Manhattan, (718)784-2084 (through June 17). A genial showcase of the 18 artists from 14 countries who have worked on the Lower Manhattan premises over the last year as part of P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center's studio programs. Self-invented systems, hybrid media (often discreetly computer-assisted), unshowy formal polish and a preference for understated ideas with resonant implications are threads that run through a sow whose transnational mix confirms yet again that New York is an important cultural node on global circulatory system (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''KEITH HARING: THE S.V.A. YEARS (1978-1980),'' School of Visual Arts, 209 East 23rd Street, (212)592-2010 (through June 17). This exhibition documents Haring's studies at S.V.A. and might interest his fans. Haring was evidently an exceptionally intelligent and energetic student, alive toa ll kinds of possbilities, from Abstract Expressionistic painting to text-based Conceptualism to video performance. Naturally it is his knack for comic graphic invention that shines, especially in a delightful series of 77 small pencil drawings made in one day called ''Manhattan Penis Drawings for Ken Hicks'' (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO, ''Terra Cotta Sculptures,'' Zabriskie Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212)752-1223 (through tomorrow). These suave, mostly small terra cotta figures were made by Archipenko (1887-1964), an innovator in early 20th-century sculpture, in the 1930's. They deal with the female form, from solid, sensuous torso to near-abstraction in which open spaces play a role. One oftheir distinctive features is elegant surface finish, highly polished with the addition of colored elements and inlays to the basic structure. He is at his best in several beautifully modeled torsos of idealized figures that reach for the spiritual essence of form (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''KOREAN CERAMICS FROM THE MUSEUM OF ORIENTAL CERAMICS, OSAKA,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)879-5500 (through Sunday). This beautifully serene exhibition, cloistered within the Met's white-on-white Korean arts gallery, presents 48 objects, all considered masterpieces. For starters, there are the exquisitely refined 12th-century Koryo dynasty celadons, coveted even by the Chinese. Then comes the marvelously loose, incipiently modern punchong ware from the early Chorean penchant for roughness, asymmetry and the unexpected. The show closes with the restrained all-white and blue-and-white procelain made from the late 15th to early 19th century, which return to a Chinese aesthetic but remain subtly apart in their assertive shapes, plain surfaces and slight irregularities: in short, in their perfect imperfectness. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).</p>
        <p>HANS HOFMANN, ''The Summer Studio,'' Ameringer/Howard Fine Art, 41 East 57th Street, (212)935-1110 (through today). Cape Cod was the summer life and subject of Holmann (1880-1966), who observed it for more than 30 years from his Provincetown studio. In oil, watercolor or pen and ink, he depicted it in many modes, from abstraction to outright realism. The works here vary from mere sketches to large finished paintings, but collectively they have the exuberance of Hofmann's engagement with a very lively scene (Glueck).</p>
        <p>*''THE PRINZHORN COLLECTION: TRACES UPON THE WUNDERBLOCK,'' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)219-2166 (through tomorrow). The legendary Prinzhorn Collection, amassed just before and after World War I in Heidelberg, Germany, is one of the originating points of the study and appreciation of art by the insane. The collection's first New York appearance is a mine of exciting new information: 200 drawings and handmade books that often stun the eye and always touch the heart, by mostly unfamiliar artists. Its suggestion that the art of the insane is not pure, timeless and autonomous but part of a larger continuum of art and visual culture may be its most valuable lesson. Hours: Today, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Smith).</p>
        <p>*MEYER VAISMAN, Gavin Brown, 436 West 15th Street, (212)627-5258 (through tomorrow). Mr. Vaisman's startling and haunting sculpture ''Barbara Fischer/Psychoanalysis'' centers on the whole-body cast of a naked, corpulent older woman - his former therapist. Enveloped in pink tulle, she wears a jester's cap and holds out a Harlequin's suit patched together from men's and women's clothing. A richly suggestive metaphor of psychospiritual healing, it may be the most compelling thing this artist has produced (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MAX WEBER, Gerald Peters, 24 East 78th Street, (212)628-9760 (through tomorrow). A delightful survey of the rambling career of one of America's earliest modernists and possibly its first Cubist, shows that the long decline Weber is supposed to have entered after 1920 is dotted with lively works in several styles and sustained by a consistent and tender sense of color and touch (Smith).</p>
