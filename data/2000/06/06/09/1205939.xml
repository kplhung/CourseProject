        <p>Vice President Al Gore plans to kick off a new stage of his campaign next week, making a ''progress and prosperity'' tour devoted to the relatively new questions of how best to guide the nation in an era of budget surpluses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said he would open the discussion on Tuesday in New York City with a speech about protecting Medicare from what he called ''political poaching'' and reserving it for the use of the 40 million Americans for whom it was collected.</p>
        <p>''We're at a turning point in our country's history,'' Mr. Gore, the putative Democratic presidential nominee, said in an interview here today. ''We've never had a debate about how to make decisions concerning a large, continuing surplus, and there are a number of big choices that we have to make.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''The decisions related to the surplus are no less difficult or important than the decisions we have made concerning the deficit.''</p>
        <p>Besides Medicare, he said he would delve into other questions, including: ''How to use entitlements correctly; how to pay off the debt more quickly in order to reduce interest rates and promote more economic growth; and how to make the investments that are needed in top priorities like education, to get people access to the skills they need.''</p>
        <p>The vice president's new focus is less about Medicare than about the ongoing debate over how best to take advantage of the nation's newly found fiscal health. It is part of Mr. Gore's effort to sell voters on debt reduction as a smarter alternative to the big tax cuts advocated by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his expected Republican rival this fall.</p>
        <p>It is also part of the Gore campaign's effort to put a positive sheen on Mr. Gore's candidacy and to make explicit use of what his advisers say is perhaps his best argument for being elected: the unprecedented prosperity of the last several years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has not received much direct credit for that prosperity, but the tour, to highlight the economic progress in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio that will be major electoral battlegrounds, should increase his association with it.</p>
        <p>''The American people deserve the credit for the strength of the economy,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I think the policies of this administration, which I've helped shape, have indeed unlocked some of that potential and made it much more likely to occur.''</p>
        <p>The vice president frequently points to his association with Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary and one of the nation's most respected financial analysts, as testimony to his fiscal discipline, but he said that he came up with the idea of putting Medicare into a ''lock box'' on his own.</p>
        <p>''I consult with Bob Rubin all the time,'' Mr. Gore said today. ''But this particular proposal on the Medicare lock box I put forward and I hoped that he would react positively to it, and he did.''</p>
        <p>The Medicare surplus this year is projected by its trustees at $22.3 billion, and to total $250 billion over 10 years. The surplus comes from payroll taxes levied on employees and employers to pay for hospitalization, nursing home care and other health benefits under Medicare.</p>
        <p>Under the government's accounting rules, the Medicare surplus has been considered part of the general government surplus, unlike the surplus generated by Social Security, which both legally and politically has been segregated from excess general government revenue.</p>
        <p>Both the Democratic and the Republican parties have agreed to use the Social Security surplus, which amounts to more than $2 trillion over the next decade, only to reduce the national debt held by the public. The public debt stands at $3.5 trillion.</p>
        <p>Estimates of the non-Social Security surplus over the next decade range from $800 billion to nearly $2 trillion, depending on what assumptions are made about how fast government spending will increase.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is relying on the non-Social Security surplus to pay for his tax cut plan, which is valued at $1.3 trillion over the rest of the decade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's Medicare ''lock box'' proposal would reduce the amount of money available for tax cuts by $250 billion, making it easier for him to portray Mr. Bush's tax plan as fiscally irresponsible, especially when added to Republican proposals for additional spending on programs like national missile defense.</p>
        <p>The vice president has been determined to avoid negative references to Mr. Bush over the last few weeks. He said today that the intention of his Medicare proposal was not to make Mr. Bush's plan seem riskier, but he would not be unhappy if a voter drew that conclusion.</p>
        <p>''If that makes it harder for someone to use the Medicare trust fund for purposes other than Medicare, then that should be one of the effects,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's plan would also restrict Democrats from using all of the non-Social Security surplus for additional spending.</p>
        <p>Jim Horney, an analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research group, said of the Gore plan: ''This is obviously an attempt to reduce the likelihood of there being big tax increases or spending that would eat up the surplus. If it helps to avoid big tax cuts or spending increases before dealing with the long-term issues of Medicare and Social Security, that would be good.''</p>
        <p>Referring to the Medicare surplus, Mr. Horney said, ''It's not nearly as much as the Social Security surplus, but it's still a significant amount of money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's lock box plan would not do anything to shore up Medicare, which, without any changes, is expected to become insolvent around 2025. By earmarking the Medicare surplus for debt reduction, the main economic effect of Mr. Gore's plan would be to underscore his commitment to paying off the national debt by 2013 or sooner, a path that he says would help keep interest rates down and stimulate economic growth.</p>
        <p>But by setting up even an indirect tradeoff between Medicare and tax cuts, Mr. Gore is returning to a political strategy that Democrats have used successfully against Republicans for years: implying that Republican tax cuts for the rich would endanger health insurance for some of the nation's most vulnerable citizens.</p>
