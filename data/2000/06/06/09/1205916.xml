        <p>DO-GOODERS tend to make for dull reading, so let's ignore Matt Foreman, the executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, for the moment, and zoom in on the dead man in his arms.</p>
        <p>Not the actual body of the dead man, just the bronze urn that once held his remains. But you're soon thinking of the urn as a person, maybe because of the way Mr. Foreman holds it in his lap for two and a half hours, occasionally patting it, as you would a cat, a living thing; maybe because of the way he refers to the urn by name.</p>

        <p>DO-GOODERS tend to make for dull reading, so let's ignore Matt Foreman, the executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, for the moment, and zoom in on the dead man in his arms.</p>
        <p>Not the actual body of the dead man, just the bronze urn that once held his remains. But you're soon thinking of the urn as a person, maybe because of the way Mr. Foreman holds it in his lap for two and a half hours, occasionally patting it, as you would a cat, a living thing; maybe because of the way he refers to the urn by name.</p>
        <p>''Oh, that's Julio,'' Mr. Foreman says, when you arrive at his storefront office in the Village and spot it on the shelf.</p>
        <p>It's hard to get a good look at a man's face when he's been reduced to ash, to take some measure of him, but the lettering on the urn shows this man has died young. ''Julio Rivera: May 8, 1961, July 2, 1990'' -- he was only 29. Was it AIDS, which one expects when finding an urn in a prominent spot in the office of a gay rights group?</p>
        <p>''He was murdered on July 2, 1990, in Jackson Heights, Queens,'' Mr. Foreman says, picking up the urn. ''I used to deal with so many cases. You feel like you know people even when you don't. It became the first antigay case ever prosecuted in New York. It's still the only antigay case ever prosecuted in New York. The police at first dismissed it as a drug-related incident. Julio wasn't a drug dealer; as a drug crime it made no sense. He had been hit in the head with a bottle, they put the claw end of a hammer in his skull, he was stabbed'' -- tired, now -- ''I want to sit down with Julio.''</p>
        <p>Sitting down, in his crowded little office.</p>
        <p>''I even dragged him with us to  Albany. This was not a drug-related case.''</p>
        <p>This week, the State Senate approved a bill to enhance penalties for crimes in which the victim had been singled out because of race, religion, or sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foreman, 45, with his law degree and straight-arrow shirt and tie, worked for the bill for 10 years -- as executive director of the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, for the last four years with Empire State. His manner is low key and courteous: lobbying in Albany this week, he did not display Mr. Rivera's urn to politicians. He feels that would not have been correct.</p>
        <p>Still, he is an angry man -- when speaking about Mr. Rivera, one of whose attackers fled the country and is at large, when discussing other gay victims.</p>
        <p>Was Mr. Foreman ever the victim of a violent crime?</p>
        <p>NO, not really, he says. But it's like when he talks to a group of gay people and asks, ''Ever been pushed, because you were gay?''; ''Ever been spat on?''; and soon everybody in the room has a hand up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foreman's father was a mining executive, his mother a nurse. He was born in Idaho and grew up ''all over'' the West.</p>
        <p>So he can ride a horse?</p>
        <p>A look of distaste, at the word ''horse.''</p>
        <p>''I don't like to,'' Mr. Foreman says.</p>
        <p>Nor was he a kid who liked sports. He played football for two years in high school to please his father, and didn't know until his senior year that a team had four opportunities to move the ball 10 yards. He was called ''faggot'' as a boy. Similar epithets were written on his campaign posters when he ran for student body president at West Virginia Wesleyan College. Mr. Foreman, in a move he regrets to this day, suggested the rumors were false.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foreman worked for Gov. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, studied at New York University Law School and returned to the governor's office -- probably the only guy in the world, he says, who left Greenwich Village to come out.</p>
        <p>''In the back of my mind, there was always that idea that I'd go back to West Virginia and run for office and have a family and be governor,'' Mr. Foreman says, a little embarrassed. ''All that goes up in smoke. You could never go back as an openly gay person and become governor. They just scooted me out. Nothing was ever said. But that's the nature of the way people experience discrimination. People don't say anything to your face.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Foreman has been beaten up while holding hands with a boyfriend in West Virginia, and knocked over by a car after being taunted in the Village. No serious injuries.</p>
        <p>The fellow -- the spirit -- with whom Mr. Foreman is sharing his office space: How did Julio Rivera's urn come to be here?</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera had been cremated, Mr. Foreman says. A sister, in Miami, scattered his ashes into the ocean, then threw the urn and a rosary into the sea. A week ago, a diver finds the urn, the ABC affiliate in Miami does a television report, Julio's sister reclaims the urn. Mr. Foreman is not a religious man, but he can't help thinking there is a reason for this. The urn is shipped to New York. This past weekend, at the gay pride parade in Queens, the street on which Mr. Rivera was killed is renamed for him. His urn is taken, under wraps, to Albany.</p>
        <p>Put a face on Mr. Rivera.</p>
        <p>''A bartender, handsome, a whole lot of fun.''</p>
        <p>Was he political?</p>
        <p>''No. He liked being the center of attention.''</p>
        <p>A little smile.</p>
        <p>''And that was certainly the case on Saturday, when the street was named after him.''</p>
