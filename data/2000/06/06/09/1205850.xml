        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>''AIDA'' (Tony winner for best musical actress, score, scenery and lighting). Pretty much everything that's right about this Disney cartoon pretending to be a Broadway musical can be summed up in two words: Heather Headley. Playing a Nubian princess in captivity, the Tony-winning Ms. Headley has fire, self-possession and an uncompromising sense of purpose. That is more than can be said for anyone or anything around her. ''Aida,'' which has been directed by Robert Falls with songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, seems stranded in its own candy-colored limbo, thrashing between childish silliness and civic preachiness, between campy spoof and tragic tear-jerker, between two and three dimensions. Although it is the first Disney production for Broadway not to be inspired by an animated film, it nonetheless appears to be waiting for the greater destiny of translation into a cartoon. With Adam Pascal (of ''Rent'') as the hieroglyph-stiff love interest and Sherie Rene Scott, making like a refugee from ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' as Aida's rival. The set designer Bob Crowley provided the Las Vegas arcade that is passing for ancient Egypt (2:30). Palace, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4747. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $85 (Ben Brantley).</p>

Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $85 (Ben Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''CONTACT'' (Tony winner for best musical, choreography and featured actor and actress). The most potent antidepressant available in New York. Advertising has it that this show from the director and choreographer Susan Stroman is a ''dance play,'' but that hardly captures how it makes you feel. Aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble, Ms. Stroman has created the unthinkable: a sexy, polished work that restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. A theatrical portfolio of three seemingly unrelated vignettes set in different time periods, with top-drawer leading performances from Deborah Yates and the Tony winners Boyd Gaines and Karen Ziemba, ''Contact'' uses an ingeniously selected medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys. But like a classic Rodgers and Hart musical it converts the messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into something as smoothly sweet and tart as a Key lime pie. Both the intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given idealized, elegant form  (2:00). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $80 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''COPENHAGEN'' (Tony winner for best play, director and featured actress). Who would ever have thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about atomic physics would be such electrifying companions? Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened. Mr. Frayn turns the encounter among the men and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (the Tony-winning Blair Brown), into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, from the fate of the world in the atomic age to the nature of friendship. Under the meticulous direction of Michael Blakemore, with three fiercely passionate performances, the result is a most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas (2:20). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Performance added 6/12 at 8, no performance 6/13. Tickets: $30 to $65; $25 student rush tickets at box office on day of performance (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''KISS ME, KATE'' (Tony winner for best musical revival, musical director, musical actor, costumes and orchestration). A mouthwatering revival, with ham as the plat du jour, of Cole Porter's sybarite's delight of a musical about battling egos in show business. As presented by a preening cast led by the wonderful Marin Mazzie and the Tony-winning Brian Stokes Mitchell, who wear a spotlight as if it were a dressing gown and vice versa, this ''Kate'' proves that ham can indeed make a banquet if the spices are zesty enough. Avoiding the attitudes that are anathema to lively revivals of vintage musicals -- reverence and condescension -- the director Michael Blakemore and the choreographer Kathleen Marshall have shaped a show that is broad, brazen  and finally irresistible. The production feels like one long ear-to-ear grin. The top-drawer Porter score has been beautifully orchestrated by Don Sebesky and is appetizingly sung by an ensemble that features a sharp-edged ingenue named Amy Spanger (2:20). Beck, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $29 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN'' (Tony winner for best featured actor). Every time Cherry Jones and Gabriel Byrne make physical contact in this heart-stopping new production of Eugene O'Neill's great, elegiac love story, the floodgates open to a tide of clashing emotions. The characters they play, an earthy farm woman and a burned-out actor, are as opposite as the quick and the dead. But it is clear that each is wearing a mask that only the other can remove. What makes this ''Moon,'' lovingly directed by Daniel Sullivan, so illuminating is the extraordinary transparency of its stars: their ability to play, and display, all those layers at once. To watch Ms. Jones, Mr. Byrne and the Tony-winning Roy Dotrice react to one another is to realize the degree to which O'Neill's last completed play is about how everyone is an actor, a deceiver by necessity. Infused with both clear-eyed observation and a warm, luminous empathy, the performance's solid three hours melt into a quick-coursing stream (2:45). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 and $70; $26 (at box office only) (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE REAL THING'' (Tony winner for best play revival, actor and actress). This immensely appealing revival of the Tom Stoppard play, from the Donmar Warehouse in London, is a rare thing even in what has been an exceptionally strong season for straight plays: an elegant comedy of infidelity filled with the sort of comebacks that people only wish they were capable of themselves. True, Mr. Stoppard's anatomy of a cerebral (and anachronistically romantic) playwright, played with all-conquering charm by the Tony-winning Stephen Dillane, is also always subverting itself, pointing out how some things, love among them, defy glib articulation. But, ah, how articulately it manages to say so. If its structural game-playing seems a tad too clever this time around, few comedies have managed to have it so successfully both ways. David Leveaux is the highly accomplished director. The delectable Jennifer Ehle, a standout in an exceptionally polished cast and a Tony winner, plays the self-possessed object of Mr. Dillane's affections (2:15). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $70 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>+ ''THE LARAMIE PROJECT.'' An enormously good-willed, very earnest and often moving work of theatrical journalism. Overseen by the director and writer Moises Kaufman, the inspired talent behind ''Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' this more self-conscious production examines the impact of the brutal killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay university student, on the town of Laramie, Wyo. Eight actors play 60 characters based on interviews conducted by Mr. Kaufman and his ensemble in Laramie in the wake of the crime. The young cast is more effective in creating a general climate of feeling than in summoning authentic portraits of individuals, yet there's no denying the work's emotional pull. The overall effect is not unlike one of the candlelight vigils described here, a stately procession through which swims a stirring medley of emotions: anger, sorrow, bewilderment and, most poignantly, a defiant glimmer of hope (2:35). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Mondays and Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $20 and $55 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* PROOF. An exhilarating and assured new play that turns the esoteric world of higher mathematics literally into a back porch drama, as accessible and compelling as a detective story. A mystery about the authorship of a particularly important proof, it is also about twin enigmas: genius and love. Without any baffling erudition, the play presents mathematicians as both blessed and bedeviled by the gift for abstraction that ties them achingly to one another and separates them, also achingly, from concrete-minded folks like you and me. Perhaps most satisfying of all, it does so without a moment of meanness. As directed by Daniel Sullivan with the pace of a psychological thriller, and performed by an exemplary cast, most notably Mary-Louise Parker, the play reaches into the most competitive and difficult intellectual terrain and finds -- guess what? -- good people (2:00). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>+ ''TALLER THAN A DWARF.'' Given the comic credentials of the playwright, Elaine May, the director, Alan Arkin, and the star, Matthew Broderick, this is a stunning disaster. The story of an ordinary man from Queens on the day his midlife crisis comes home to roost, it is crippled by gag-based scenes, dialogue that seems to have been written with a laugh track to be inserted later and characters whose motivations for saying and doing anything are either trivial, contrived or obscured until it's too late to care (1:35). Longacre, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $65 (Weber).</p>
        <p>+ ''UNCLE VANYA.'' Anton Chekhov, meet Henny Youngman. The director Michael Mayer's ill-advised new interpretation of the 1897 drama for the Roundabout Theater Company, which manages to dim even the luster of the extraordinary British actor Sir Derek Jacobi, seems determined to trace the borscht belt back to Mother Russia. This is a world of stand-up sufferers who never look more contented than when expounding on their profound unhappiness directly to the audience from the center of the stage. Get thee behind me, Stanislavski. The evening, which also features Laura Linney and Brian Murray, offers a few lightning flashes that illuminate the anguish in the forced frivolity, mostly from Sir Derek and Roger Rees. But by and large you don't believe that these noisy show-offs even know one another, much less that they are capable of inflicting deep mutual pain (2:40). Brooks Atkinson, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m.  Tickets: $45 to $65 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>+ ''WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE.'' In this shrewd and bristly performance piece, Eric Bogosian turns his gimlet eye upon himself and finds himself wanting, complicit in the cultural wasteland he abhors. The interesting effect is a kind of sympathy for the businessmen, drug dealers, evangelists, street people and suburbanites he has so memorably skewered in the past (2:00). Jane Street Theater, 113 Jane Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8 and 11; tomorrow at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $49.50 (Weber).</p>
        <p>+ ''THE WILD PARTY.'' The sort of evening that gives orgies a bad name. The season's second theatrical adaptation of Joseph Moncure March's Jazz Age cult poem (the first was at the Manhattan Theater Club), this shrill and feverish show seems determined to take the fun out of hedonism. Featuring pastiche songs by Michael John LaChiusa, who wrote the show's book with its director, George C. Wolfe, ''Wild Party II'' is big on letting its decadent characters suffer loudly and aggressively in the spotlight. The suffering is embodied by talented stars like Mandy Patinkin, Toni Collette (of ''The Sixth Sense,'' making a most creditable Broadway debut) and the legendary Eartha Kitt. But if ''Wild Party I'' seemed to be a party with no personalities, ''Wild Party II'' feels like a parade of personalities in search of a missing party. Actually,  the shows are equally effective at guaranteeing that a good time is had by no one (2:10). Virginia, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
