        <p>An officer of the Police Department's Street Crime Unit is to surrender today to face charges in the on-duty shooting of a Bronx teenager more than a year ago, the Bronx district attorney's office said last night.</p>
        <p>The shooting of Dante Johnson, then 16, prompted outrage both because it came just a few months after the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo by officers from the Street Crime Unit and because of comments by Police Commissioner Howard Safir questioning why the young man was on the streets after midnight.</p>

        <p>An officer of the Police Department's Street Crime Unit is to surrender today to face charges in the on-duty shooting of a Bronx teenager more than a year ago, the Bronx district attorney's office said last night.</p>
        <p>The shooting of Dante Johnson, then 16, prompted outrage both because it came just a few months after the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo by officers from the Street Crime Unit and because of comments by Police Commissioner Howard Safir questioning why the young man was on the streets after midnight.</p>
        <p>Steven Reed, a spokesman for the district attorney, would not comment on what charges would be brought against the officer, Mark Conway. The officer's lawyer, Stuart London, said he had not been told what the charges would be.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson was seriously wounded in the incident, which took place just after midnight on May 26, 1999. Friends said at the time that he was on his way home from a basketball game.</p>
        <p>The police said that Mr. Johnson and a friend ran when the officers from the Street Crime Unit, suspecting a gun, attempted to question them. When Officer Conway, in a car, caught up with Mr. Johnson, he reached out the car window to grab him. There was a struggle, during which Officer Conway pulled out his gun. A single shot was fired, striking Mr. Johnson in the abdomen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson spent six months in the hospital, which is one reason for the lengthy delay between the incident and the filing of charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. London said Officer Conway testified before the grand jury about a week ago.</p>
        <p>''Although we were disappointed that he has to surrender at all, I am cautiously optimistic that the charges will be less severe than had he not testified in the grand jury,'' Mr. London said.</p>
        <p>He said he thought the charges would be minor, and not include an intentional crime.</p>
        <p>''This was an accident and it would be mind-boggling to me that this grand jury did not find it an accident,'' Mr. London said. He said Officer Conway's car was at a complete stop when he grabbed Mr. Johnson, and that Mr. Johnson had struggled rather than submit to a stop and frisk.</p>
        <p>He described Officer Conway as a highly decorated 14-year veteran who had never been involved in a shooting before and who had only one civilian complaint lodged against him, which was ruled unsubstantiated by the Civilian Complaint Review Board.</p>
        <p>Mr. London said the officer had been assigned to desk duty on Randalls Island, the headquarters of the Street Crime Unit, since the shooting.</p>
        <p>A senior police official said last night that the department would not comment on the charges until they were unsealed. Commissioner Safir said after the shooting that he believed it was an accident.</p>
