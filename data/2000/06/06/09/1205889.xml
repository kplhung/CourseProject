        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It was flattering to recognize my words in Paul Krugman's June 4 column about economic ideologies. But he cites my defense of sound money to highlight his opposite view that governments should print money to stimulate a depressed economy.</p>
        <p>The debate over whether a free-market approach has better economic outcomes than central planning has been resolved. When Mr. Krugman defends the government-knows-best policies of John Maynard Keynes, he shows a disdain for capitalism and the individual's ability to make rational economic decisions.</p>

        <p>The debate over whether a free-market approach has better economic outcomes than central planning has been resolved. When Mr. Krugman defends the government-knows-best policies of John Maynard Keynes, he shows a disdain for capitalism and the individual's ability to make rational economic decisions.</p>
        <p>Entrepreneurs need money that is a meaningful unit of account and a reliable store of value. Currency devaluation is not only economically self-defeating; it's immoral.</p>
        <p>The gold standard has many admirers -- including Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman -- because it represents discipline, not political expediency.</p>
        <p>JUDY SHELTON  Marshall, Va., June 6, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is an economist.</p>
