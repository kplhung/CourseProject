        <p>Christopher d'Amboise's ''Triptych'' is the latest premiere in the Diamond Project, the mini-festival of new works being presented throughout the New York City Ballet's season at the New York State Theater.</p>
        <p>There is a mystery about the piece. Set to Bartok, it evokes an incantation with Wendy Whelan as an initiate and Jock Soto as a magician who animates a community, and his acolytes, Albert Evans and Kristin Sloan, an unknown in the corps.</p>
        <p>Intermission chatter on Wednesday night ran along the lines of ''not what I expected.'' Yet ''not what I expected'' is exactly what one expects of Mr. d'Amboise. There is a hint of hidden scenario behind his plotless choreography, and this colors his use of the familiar classical vocabulary in a contemporary way.</p>
        <p>Much of the ballet's strangeness derives from Mark Stanley's ingenious lighting, which tends to keep the eight-couple ensemble in mild obscurity, and also from the Bartok score, Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta. Neil Stulberg's conducting brought out both the eeriness that seeps through the dominant string instruments and the contrasting vivid outbursts. ''Triptych,'' however, is not a dancey work. Its rhythmic pulse is overshadowed by a cerebral structure that plays skillfully with repeated motifs and seems to peel off layers of potential meaning that, in the end, remain enigmatic.</p>
        <p>For all its lack of liveliness, the ballet has a compelling interest. One wants to see what will come next, even if one may not want to see the work repeatedly after the surprise element is gone.</p>
        <p>The applause at the end, however, was strong. Mr. d'Amboise was one of the company's principal dancers, served as Pennsylvania Ballet's artistic director and has choreographed for City Ballet in the past.</p>
        <p>Good will alone does not explain the reception. Mr. d'Amboise is well within the neo-classic plotless tradition of City Ballet but typically explores what else can be done with a leotard ballet.</p>
        <p>His solution is to extend movement into pictorial imagery. The curtain opens on a corps, holding arms up with wrists together. The shape evokes a jar held atop each dancer's head in an ancient land. Ms. Whelan, her indigo tights bathed in a blue spotlight, is in front, separated from the corps in similar tights and sequined bodices by Holly Hynes. Color sets the dancers apart. The corps is in brown. Mr. Evans, who enters later, is in red, and Ms. Sloan, in another shade of blue, shows her extremely strong toe work as she skims across in a diagonal. She will not reappear until the last section with Mr. Soto, in gray.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sloan's brief appearance in the beginning is echoed by the choreographic motifs that Mr. d'Amboise presents like throwaway lines and then impresses upon the eye as they recur with increasing frequency. In addition to the jar shape, Mr. d'Amboise likes a winged image. There is also a hoop formed by the men's arms, through which the women thrust their heads.</p>
        <p>Ms. Whelan's asymmetrical signature pose, knee bent to one side, is picked up by Mr. Soto. Similarly, a woman swung like a pendulum becomes an image multiplied by other couples. The same holds true for men rolling under women moving forward on toe and a sprint position.</p>
        <p>The corps that regroups around Ms. Whelan is identified with the strings and does not necessarily echo her spiky flexed-foot movements. Mr. d'Amboise knows how to move his troops around, and it is from the group that Mr. Evans emerges. His duet with Ms. Whelan introduces the hoop image as six couples in back move out of the shadows, revolve and go into the pendulum swings.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Evans exits, Ms. Sloan, like a heavenly messenger, returns with Mr. Soto. Ms. Whelan, on the floor, sits up and becomes aware of the duet behind her and joins to form a trio. The piano follows up on the light percussion, and as the music swells, Ms. Sloan seems like Mr. Soto's attendant as he works his magic. Ms. Whelan kneels at his feet and Ms. Sloan circles around them.</p>
        <p>A faster rhythm introduces angular solos for Mr. Evans and Mr. Soto, and some principals weave through a maze formed by the ensemble. The end is a hodgepodge of the ballet's previous images, from wings to jars. Does it add up? Not really.</p>
        <p>The dancers were nonetheless admirable and thoroughly committed. Later in the evening, there was no finer example of how superb performances can color a problematic ballet than when a fine cast gave Balanchine's occasionally soporific ''Brahms-Schoenberg Quartet'' the performance of a lifetime.</p>
        <p>Every dancer came through with stupendous attack, energizing the choreography at every instant. Nikolaj Hubbe, properly emphatic, was outstanding in the third section with Yvonne Borree. Never has the neo-romantic duet of the second part been projected with such exciting extremes as Jenifer Ringer and James Fayette showed in their high lifts and extra-arched backs. Jennie Somogyi, Philip Neal and Michele Gifford set the pace grandly in the beginning and Maria Kowroski and Charles Askegard pulled out all the stops in the final Gypsy section. Hugo Fiorato conducted.</p>
