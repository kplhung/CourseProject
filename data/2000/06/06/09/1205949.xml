        <p>When he does seek guidance, the aide whom Gov. George W. Bush turns to the most is Karl Rove. Vice President Al Gore bounces ideas off Carter Eskew. Both aides have been known to be interrupted as many as a dozen times a day by calls from their bosses from the road.</p>
        <p>Their requests can be about anything. For instance, Mr. Gore was unsure whether it would look bad if he baby-sat for his grandson instead of joining his wife and daughter at the Million Mom March in Washington.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to stay home and baby-sit Wyatt during the march,'' Mr. Eskew recalled the vice president telling him. ''Do you think that's O.K.?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides could not come up with a major example in which they had persuaded the governor to change his mind.</p>
        <p>After weeks, the Gore campaign offered only one: The vice president was adamant that he go to the Super Bowl last January to see the Tennessee Titans. The problem was that the game was on the Sunday before the New Hampshire primary.</p>
        <p>It took Mr. Eskew and Charles Burson, the chief of staff who is also a Titans fan, to tell Mr. Gore that ''it was not the best use of his time,'' said  Chris Lehane, a Gore spokesman</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Titans lost the game.</p>
