        <p>Editorial says effort to cobble together compromise measure that combines differing bankruptcy law changes passed by House and Senate seems to be preserving some of worst elements of originial versions, giving unsophisticated lower- and middle-income debtors less protection than they need and wealthier debtors more protection than they deserve; says there is aditional danger that Republicans may succeed in eliminating amendment that would prevent those who engage in violence at abortion clinics from hiding behind Bankruptcy Code to escape court-imposed financial penalties for their crimes</p>

        <p>Congressional leaders are busily trying to cobble together a compromise measure that combines the differing bankruptcy law changes passed by the House and Senate. Regrettably, there are indications that the compromise will preserve some of the worst elements of the original versions -- giving unsophisticated lower- and middle-income debtors less protection than they need and wealthier debtors more protection than they deserve.</p>
        <p>Now, to make matters worse, there is a danger that Republicans may succeed in eliminating one of the positive aspects of the Senate bill. This is an amendment added by an 80-to-17 margin in the Senate that would prevent those who engage in intimidation and violence at abortion clinics from hiding behind the Bankruptcy Code to escape court-imposed financial penalties for their crimes.</p>

        <p>Now, to make matters worse, there is a danger that Republicans may succeed in eliminating one of the positive aspects of the Senate bill. This is an amendment added by an 80-to-17 margin in the Senate that would prevent those who engage in intimidation and violence at abortion clinics from hiding behind the Bankruptcy Code to escape court-imposed financial penalties for their crimes.</p>
        <p>Senator Charles Schumer of New York offered the amendment to strengthen the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. It is intended to close an increasingly popular loophole by making it plain that violators cannot escape legal judgments by concealing their assets and filing for bankruptcy, much as defendants have done in several recent cases. Unless it is quickly closed, Mr. Schumer warns, the loophole will inevitably undermine the effectiveness of a federal law that has proved useful in deterring and punishing clinic violence.</p>
