        <p>In 1941 Edward Weston photographed the grassy yard in Nashville where the sculptor William Edmondson (1874-1951) carved and displayed his work. Judging from the pictures, it was an enchanted ground.</p>
        <p>The limestone sculptures, cut from castoff blocks, look almost translucent under the sun. Dozens of figures -- celestial, human, animal -- seem to be enacting a kind of epic folk opera: score by Scott Joplin, libretto by Aesop, choreography by the great master dancers of Yorubaland.</p>
        <p>Some hint of this effect can be found in ''The Art of William Edmondson,'' an exhibition organized by the Cheekwood Museum of Art in Nashville and now at the Museum of American Folk Art. Nearly 45 of Edmonson's sculptures are shown against a blowup of one of Weston's pictures, along with photographs of the sculptor by Consuelo Kanaga and Louise Dahl-Wolfe.</p>
        <p>As one sees at a glance, all creatures, lowly and exalted -- hoot owls and angels, preachers and politicians, athlete-heroes and back-porch neighbors -- found their way into Edmondson's work from the time he carved his first stone piece in 1931. He was 59 and recently retired from 24 years as a janitor at Nashville Woman's Hospital. His real career was just beginning.</p>
        <p>During the next 17 years, using scrap stone and a railroad spike and a hammer as tools, he produced hundreds of sculptures, most of them figurative, others near-abstract, as tombstones and garden ornaments for the city African-Americans.</p>
        <p>Many of the images were religious, and specifically biblical. The sisters Martha and Mary appear as plump twins tucked under a vigorously chiseled coverlet, and Eve as a strapping lass in a fig-leaf miniskirt. The crucified Jesus is an infantile figure in a diaper, something like the early Christian Christ, floating against the cross, hands held high in a gesture of praise and release.</p>
        <p>There's also a church-shaped Noah's ark that Edmondson originally placed on a high base made of stone columns. The base, visible in photographs but now lost, probably represented Mount Ararat, where the ark perched safe and dry after the floods had receded, and for which Nashville's first black cemetery was named.</p>
        <p>Edmondson said the ideas for his sculptures were heaven sent, delivered in visions or dreams. Traditional artists in Africa and India say the same thing. It's another way of talking about what some of us refer to as inspiration.</p>
        <p>Wherever they came from, angels abound in his work. One in the show has big hair, a solemn face, wings like cupboard doors, and a pocketbook clutched to her side. The subtle distinctions in texture made among her hair, flesh and wings are an Edmondson hallmark and a source of intense optical pleasure in his art.</p>
        <p>Despite his otherworldly subjects, this artist was no recluse saint. He was up on the news and paid tribute to celebrities of the day, from Jack Johnson, the first black world heavyweight champion, to Eleanor Roosevelt, who visited Nashville in 1934. And his own friends and neighbors are well represented in his work.</p>
        <p>Here one encounters classic types: a preacher with a Sharptonesque coif, a buttoned-up schoolmarm, a pretty ingenue in a squared-off cape. But Edmondson seems to have been close to some of his subjects, like the affectionate couple in ''Bess and Joe,'' and he warmed their figures with closely observed details: Joe is shown in a rakish snap-brim cap; Bess's legs peek, slim and shapely, from beneath her lifted skirt.</p>
        <p>Particularly expressive are carvings of animals. Some are naturalistic: an alert squirrel munches his lunch; three small birds nod on a log. Others have a near-human presence. An extraordinary eagle with outstretched wings projects a grandeur that Edmondson's crucifixes play down. And then there are fantastic beings, like the ardent, buxom ''Mermaid'' and the all-but-abstract ''Critter,'' an asymmetrical wedge of stone with a single shrewdly positioned notch to indicate a mouth.</p>
        <p>''Mermaid,'' at nearly three feet long, is one of his largest works. It is one among his many sculptures with cultural roots running straight, and still green, to Africa. And ''Critter'' exemplifies Edmondson the modernist (stylistic cousin to Brancusi) who knocked the New York art world off its feet.</p>
        <p>This happened in 1937. Dahl-Wolfe, a fashion photographer for Harper's Bazaar, had heard about Edmondson through friends in Tennessee and began taking pictures of him and his work in 1934. At the time the magazine refused to run work by black artists in its pages, so she passed the photos on to Alfred Barr, director of the Museum of Modern Art. Edmondson became the first African-American to have a solo show at the museum.</p>
        <p>It is when Edmondson is considered in the light of a mainstream institution like the Modern, in fact, that the insider-outsider dichotomies that have gathered around him and other so-called self-taught artists turn instructively paradoxical.</p>
        <p>Edmondson was intimately tied to and produced art within an economically marginal culture. But that culture has shaped virtually every aspect of American life. His art naturally looks at home in the modernist tradition, which draws so deeply on non-Western sources. It also inflects, challenges, even resists that tradition, with a whole range of specific local interests and beliefs. In the presence of his work, in short, insider and outsider are revealed to be entirely relative terms, and any attempt, however well-intentioned, to shoehorn him into either category is to shortchange him. He's too rich and complicated for that.</p>
        <p>The Edmondson exhibition, organized by Rusty Freeman of the Cheekwood Museum and in New York by Brooke Anderson, the new director of the Contemporary Center of the Museum of American Folk Art, comes with an intelligent catalog in which these issues are explored. But in the end it is the sculptures that count, and they need neither arguments not advocates.</p>
        <p>Formally spare, conceptually both lighthearted and profound, they represent a personal vision, but they also offer a credible version of Visionary Art -- one with both feet on the ground -- for a spiritually uptight age. And as to Edmondson's history-book status, there is something symbolically right in the fact that while his sculptures hold a place among modernism's monuments, his grave in Mount Ararat cemetery has no stone.</p>
        <p>''The Art of William Edmondson'' is at the Museum of American Folk Art, 2 Lincoln Square, through Aug. 27. It travels to the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester (Sept. 23 to Jan. 7); the High Museum of Art in Atlanta (Feb. 24 to May 20); and the Mennello Museum of American Folk Art in Orlando, Fla. (June 2 to Aug. 26, 2001). A dozen of his works are in ''William Edmondson and 20th-Century Self-Taught Artists'' at the Newark Museum through Aug. 13.</p>
