        <p>For Krzysztof Kieslowski, the great Polish filmmaker who died four years ago, the answers to our most troubling questions about the meaning of life and death and the existence of God can be intuited only from riddles, signs, portents, coincidences and sudden, odd strokes of fate. On entering Kieslowski's somber but far from depressing cinematic world, we find ourselves in a place where everything from household objects to chance encounters with strangers is charged with a mysterious gravity and enigmatic sense of connection. But as powerfully as his films portray human pain and longing, they also convey the preciousness of life with a conviction that few other filmmakers have succeeded in bringing to the screen.</p>
        <p>Among Kieslowski's films, including his celebrated ''Red,'' ''White'' and ''Blue'' trilogy, the work that towers over everything is ''The Decalogue,'' his 10-part, nearly 10-hour made-for-television series of reflections on the Ten Commandments. Although ''The Decalogue'' has been shown in New York by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and is available on home video, it is only just now having its commercial release in the city, at the Lincoln Plaza.</p>
        <p>If its 10 parts inevitably vary in quality, in its entirety, the cycle -- which was first shown on Polish television in 1988-89 -- stands as a masterwork of modern cinema, essential viewing for anyone who cares about the movies as a serious art form.</p>
        <p>The Lincoln Plaza will present ''The Decalogue'' chronologically in one-week programs, each consisting of two parts, for the next five weeks.</p>
        <p>Far from illustrating Old Testament laws with a thunderous drum-beating moralism, these 10 films, set mostly in the vicinity of a large, rather bleak apartment complex in Warsaw, might be described as metaphysical speculations. Without sermonizing or even trying to prove the existence of a divine power operating in the universe, these oblique dramatic parables imagine lives influenced by unseen forces whose intentions can't be predicted or even begun to be grasped.</p>
        <p>The profound pleasures they offer derive not only from their deft metaphysical playfulness but also from their storytelling genius. In portraying touching, often anguished human quandaries (including adultery, murder, kidnapping and the death of a child) ''The Decalogue'' gives each tale the structure of a mathematical equation that almost but doesn't quite balance.</p>
        <p>The cycle doesn't have a beginning, a center or a conclusive ending. The closest it comes to expressing the director's personal beliefs is probably in its brilliant eighth part, loosely inspired by the command ''Thou shalt not bear false witness  against they neighbor.''</p>
        <p>The central character Zofia (Maria Koscialkowska) a wise, kindly professor of ethics at the University of Warsaw, is paid a surprise visit by Elzbieta (Teresa Marczewska), a much younger, Polish-born American scholar who after having translated several of Zofia's books is returning to Poland to do research on the fate of Jewish survivors of World War II. Invited to sit in on one of Zofia's classes, in which the students debate and try to untangle knotty ethical conundrums, Elzbieta volunteers the story of a 6-year-old Jewish  girl, hidden in Warsaw by resistance fighters in 1943, who was brought for safekeeping to the home of a Roman Catholic couple working against the Nazis. Instead of offering her refuge, the couple suddenly changed their minds and without explanation turned her away.</p>
        <p>As Zofia listens to the story, in which no names are mentioned, her face crumples into a stricken mask, for she realizes that Elzbieta's story is autobiographical and that Zofia and her husband (now long dead) were the couple who rejected the girl. Later, when Zofia explains to Elzbieta the reasons for that rejection (they had just heard a false rumor that the people bringing the child to them were actually secret agents of the Gestapo), the questions that have haunted both women for more than four decades seem to have been answered and Elzbieta's shaky faith in humanity restored.</p>
        <p>But the story has no pat happy ending. Zofia continues to believe that she and her husband made a terrible mistake in being willing (even when their lives seemed in imminent danger) to sacrifice the little girl's life. ''Nothing is as important as the life of a child,'' she declares.</p>
        <p>The words that the screenplay by Kieslowski and his collaborator and scenarist Krzysztof Piesiewicz put into the mouth of this wonderful character, who radiates such profound humanity, come as close as any in ''The Decalogue'' to expressing Kieslowski's own philosophy. All humans, she surmises, are born with goodness and evil, qualities that are summoned by situations, and everyone grows up knowing the difference. As for the existence of God (a word she prefers not to use), he exists in all of us, although we can choose to leave God behind. Those who make that choice, however, are condemned to a state of loneliness.</p>
        <p>Although each part of ''The Decalogue'' is self-contained and may be viewed separately, the 10 have enough thematic connection so that when seen consecutively they build into a much larger and richer whole. Leitmotifs run throughout. One is the recurrent appearance of a silent young man in several episodes who gazes momentarily at the camera, an enigmatic, possibly angelic witness to the events being portrayed. And as in ''Red,'' ''White'' and ''Blue,'' the color scheme of ''The Decalogue'' is loaded with symbolism that enhances the movie's many subtle, surreal touches.</p>
        <p>The eighth part, in addition to voicing Kieslowski's ethical philosophy, recapitulates, in a student discussion, the story of Episode 2 (''Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain''), one of the most gripping in the cycle. Here, a prickly, embittered doctor who years ago lost his family in a tragic explosion, is asked to predict the fate of a patient -- who seems to be near death -- by the patient's wife, a professional musician, who is carrying another man's child. If her husband's chances of surviving are good, she explains, she will have an abortion. If not, she will have the baby and probably go off with her lover.</p>
        <p>In this part, which includes the disturbing close-up image of a bee struggling frantically to extricate itself from a container of rusty water collected from a leaky pipe, Kieslowski contrives a miracle. As grim as he could be at times, the supremely evenhanded director could also conjure up a state of grace.</p>
        <p>Echoing Zofia's statement about the importance of children, several other episodes are also concerned with their fate at the hands of adults. In Part 1 (''Thou shalt have no other gods before me'') a university professor who believes that everything in life can be measured, teaches his young son how to use a computer. When the little boy decides to go  skating, he calculates that the ice on the lake should be thick enough to support him. The professor learns tragically that nature isn't as orderly or predictable as his equations suggest. This moving story, which pits the boy's rationalist father against his religiously devout aunt as spiritual influences, is a classic fable of hubris. In one of its surreal twists, it also includes what appears to be a self-starting computer.</p>
        <p>A more brutal struggle for a child is waged in Episode 7 (''Thou shalt not steal'') in which a little girl brought up believing her grandmother is really her mother and her biological mother her sister is kidnapped by the younger woman, who was 16 when she gave birth and is now of college age. The situation gives us one of Kieslowski's more fiendishly clever equations by wondering which is the real kidnapper: the embittered teenage mother running off with the child or the grandmother who for selfish reasons arranged to make it look as though the baby were hers?</p>
        <p>''The Decalogue'' varies enough in tone to include some comedy and suspense as well as high drama and tragedy. Part 6 (''Thou shalt not commit adultery''), which was released in an expanded form under the title ''A Short Film About Love,'' is the relatively droll tale of a meek, virginal 19-year-old postal clerk who is a Peeping Tom and the beautiful woman across the courtyard on whom he obsessively spies.</p>
        <p>Surveillance and voyeurism also haunt Part 9 (''Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife'') about a doctor diagnosed as incurably impotent, who encourages his beautiful wife to take a lover. When she does, he becomes jealous and suicidally depressed. It is one of several tales in the cycle in which women emerge as the wiser, nobler sex.</p>
        <p>The final episode (''Thou shalt not covet they neighbor's goods'') suggests a Hitchcockian interpretation of a De Maupassant tale, in its story of two brothers (one of whom is lead singer for a rock band that performs blasphemous songs) who discover that their just-deceased father amassed a priceless stamp collection. Each becomes increasingly  paranoid that the other intends to steal it. Kieslowski makes no bones about it: greed is bad.</p>
        <p>The consistency of performances by a sprawling cast that includes both well-known and obscure Polish actors is remarkable. Directing the cast, Kieslowski avoids even a hint of melodrama, and most of the performances are restrained and internalized to the brink of introspection. What we remember most are faces wth complicated histories in which hardship and suffering are taken for granted, inner conflicts are continually flickering and an awareness of death shadows even the happiest smile.</p>
        <p>Superficially at least, this world feels so different from here and now. In the United States, especially in this time of abundance when the gospel of eternal youth proliferates, we lull ourselves into believing that somehow life can be solved. And more and more of us seek to conceal or even erase the histories Kieslowski's camera locates in his actors' faces. As long as we can erase them, presumably we can live forever.</p>
        <p>But ''The Decalogue'' also conveys the feeling that many of these people have lived more and know more about life than we do. They understand that in the best of all possible worlds fleeting glimpses of salvation are the most any of us can expect.</p>
