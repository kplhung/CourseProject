        <p>UP and down they skated, in and out they swooped. Another shot, another save.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the all-time great hockey games,'' John McMullen kept saying in his suite as Game 5 of the Stanley Cup finals moved into the third overtime early this morning. ''This is what it's all about. This is what it's supposed to be, but let's get it done.''</p>
        <p>But the Devils didn't get it done, didn't win the cup. They lost to the Dallas Stars, 1-0, on Mike Modano's tip-in of Brett Hull's blazing shot from the blue line.</p>
        <p>McMullen knew the Stanley Cup had to be somewhere in the catacombs of the Meadowlands arena, ready for presentation at center ice, but he didn't want to let on.</p>
        <p>''It's not over,'' McMullen, white-haired and white-knuckled, had said, leaning forward while surrounded by family and friends. ''We were down, 3-1, against the Flyers and we came back from that to win. Like my friend Yogi Berra says, it's not over until it's over.''</p>
        <p>But all those friends won't be able to count on McMullen for tickets next season; his sale of the Devils to YankeeNets for $175 million will be final July 12. So these playoffs are the end of an era, his last hurrah after 18 years as the Devils' chairman.</p>
        <p>''At the N.H.L. owners' meeting Wednesday, George Steinbrenner and Lewis Katz were approved,'' he said, referring to the respective Yankee and Net bosses. ''Ray Chambers was there too; he's the man behind the proposed Newark arena. Give him credit. He put the deal together.''</p>
        <p>McMullen had hoped to erect an arena in Hoboken, N.J., with private financing, but when he couldn't get site approval from Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's office, he felt he had to sell the Devils.</p>
        <p>''I had no place to go,'' he said. ''I couldn't survive in the Meadowlands. I look upon it as a political catastrophe. All I was asking was the air rights over railroad tracks that nobody is ever going to use. It's beyond me why it didn't happen and I've had remorse about having sold the team.''</p>
        <p>Was there an out clause that would let him cancel the deal now? ''Once I gave my word, that was it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>McMullen knows his life will never be the same. He talked about how he would not be going to Devils games next season, about how he would not be able to stop and wish the coaches good luck in their office across the corridor from the players' dressing room.</p>
        <p>But under the YankeeNets axis, Larry Robinson might not wish to remain as head coach.</p>
        <p>''That was the most significant move we made, the coaching change,'' McMullen said, referring to General Manager Lou Lamoriello's naming Robinson to replace Robbie Ftorek when the Devils were on a treadmill to oblivion with eight games remaining in the regular season. ''It's great the way he'll puts his arm around a player on the bench.''</p>
        <p>And will Lamoriello, whose contract expires, still be the president and general manager?</p>
        <p>''People are saying Lou will be a free agent in July,'' McMullen said, ''but I prefer to say that he can do what he wishes. The team that should have taken him was the Rangers. When they signed Glen Sather, they not only set a whole new salary scale for N.H.L. general managers but Edmonton didn't even get any compensation.''</p>
        <p>Like every club owner in every sport, McMullen is always aware of the bottom line but he has always been closer to his players than most owners have.</p>
        <p>''Ken Daneyko has been a joy,'' he said. ''Scott Stevens, you can't beat him. Martin Brodeur is a great young man. I'm glad we got Claude Lemieux back. When we were looking for a coach in 1993, Claude told me to get Jacques Lemaire, that he was the best coach out there.''</p>
        <p>McMullen listened and Lemaire was hired. Two years later the Devils used Lemaire's neutral-zone trap to win the Stanley Cup with a four-game sweep of the Detroit Red Wings in the finals.</p>
        <p>Three nights before these playoffs began, McMullen stopped at Daneyko's restaurant, Mezzanote, in nearby Caldwell, N.J., where many of the Devils' players had gathered with their wives.</p>
        <p>''I liked the players' attitude that night,'' McMullen said. ''They knew if they played well, they would do well. That's when I got the feeling that maybe we could win the Stanley Cup again.''</p>
        <p>And until this morning the Stanley Cup was in the Meadowlands arena catacombs, but now there's a sixth game in Dallas.</p>
