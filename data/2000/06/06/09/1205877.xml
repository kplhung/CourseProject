        <p>Mikhail Baryshnikov's enterprising White Oak Dance Project came to the Howard Gilman Opera House of the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday night with premieres by Mark Morris, Yvonne Rainer and John Jasperse and two older works by Trisha Brown.</p>
        <p>Art is unpredictable. Ms. Rainer and Mr. Jasperse were choreographically ambitious. But a trifle by Mr. Morris proved especially pleasant, and the most stimulating pieces were those Ms. Brown revived.</p>
        <p>''Peccadillos,'' Mr. Morris's tidbit, began amusingly when Ethan Iverson walked onstage and sat down at a toy piano to play tinkling pieces by Satie. Dancing a solo to this dollhouse music, Mr. Baryshnikov resembled a doll. Moving with deliberate stiffness, he drilled like a tin soldier, paused and looked puzzled, wiped his brow, brooded a bit, then happily clapped and stamped. Portraying a toy, he toyed with emotions and ideas.</p>
        <p>So did Ms. Rainer in ''After Many a Summer Dies the Swan.'' Presumably, that was not her intention. A leader of the experimental Judson Dance Theater of the 60's, Ms. Rainer was known for dances filled with ordinary but energetic movements performed without fuss.</p>
        <p>She went on to become a filmmaker. Nevertheless, Mr. Baryshnikov persuaded her to create her first new dance in 25 years. Strictly speaking, it was not entirely new, for it included sequences from older works rearranged as a collage.</p>
        <p>Its title derives from a line in Tennyson's poem ''Tithonus,'' which is also the title of a novel by Aldous Huxley. The choreography has nothing to do with either author. Yet since both poem and novel concern decay and death, Ms. Rainer may consider her work a return from a choreographic grave.</p>
        <p>It was danced in simple costumes by all six members of the troupe: Raquel Aedo, Emily Coates, Rosalynde LeBlanc, Michael Lomeka, Emmanuele Phuon and Mr. Baryshnikov. They walked, jogged, shuffled, nudged and lifted one another, wrapped themselves in blankets and tossed pillows. They occasionally spoke lines the program attributed to many sources, and there were snippets of recorded music by Grieg, Beethoven and Ike and Tina Turner.</p>
        <p>This was just the sort of stuff Ms. Rainer might have devised in the old days. But something was missing: life. Whereas Ms. Rainer's dancers used to have a no-nonsense briskness, the White Oak dancers looked affected, as if they were fashion models striving terribly hard to appear casual.</p>
        <p>The spoken words had a peculiar effect. Some were comic non sequiturs. Others were serious statements about global politics and finance. But this mixture of nonsense and polemics made nothing matter much.</p>
        <p>A sense of affectation also bedeviled Mr. Jasperse's ''See Through Knot,'' to electronic music by Stephen Vitiello and Frances-Marie Uitti. Juxtaposing fast and slow steps, Mr. Jasperse tangled and untangled five dancers. The movements were ingenious. But once again they didn't seem to matter much, and they lacked the intensity of Mr. Jasperse's creations for his own company.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Ms. Brown's ''Glacial Decoy'' was hypnotic. The choreography for this dance in silence, which dates from 1979, keeps sending four women drifting across the stage, only to draw them back, as if magnetized by the wings. As they come and go, large photographs by Robert Rauschenberg pass one by one across four screens. They show such commonplace things as rural landscapes, a dog, a light bulb, a chair, a bicycle and boxcars. Indeed, the entire dance is like a train of visual and choreographic images, sometimes shifting or backing up, but always going forward again.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown's ''Homemade'' was a solo from 1965 performed by Mr. Baryshnikov. As he moved with small steps and gestures, a projector attached to his body flashed a tape of the solo onto the backdrop. At first, it appeared that Mr. Baryshnikov was directly recording himself as he danced. But moments when he and his video counterpart went out of synchronization revealed that the tape depicted another performance. These discrepancies added to the choreographic fascination. Unfortunately, many steps were so intentionally minuscule that they were hard to see in this large theater, where the program continues through Sunday afternoon.</p>
        <p>DANCE REVIEW  Correction:  June 16, 2000, Friday  A picture caption in Weekend last Friday with a review of the White Oak Dance Project's performance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on June 7 misidentified the dance shown. It was ''See Through Knot.'' (''After Many a Summer Dies the Swan'' was another work on the program.)</p>
