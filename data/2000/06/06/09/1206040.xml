        <p>Adrian Hernandez, called El Duquecito by those anticipating he may be the second coming of the Yankees' El Duque, Orlando Hernandez, had a less than auspicious outing tonight in his second pitching performance in organized baseball.</p>
        <p>Hernandez, who defected from Cuba this year and was signed by the Yankees in April, pitched six-plus innings for the Norwich Navigators, the Yankees' Class AA team, against the New Britain Rock Cats.</p>
        <p>Hernandez, 24, a right-hander, gave up four runs on five hits and struck out eight, but walked seven batters, threw one wild pitch and balked.</p>
