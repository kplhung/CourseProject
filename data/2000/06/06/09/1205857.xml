        <p>In the photograph you see a boy flying, head first, toward the ground, and another boy falling fast feet first. At first you hope the boys are alive, and then you hope they are dead. Finally you breathe a sigh of relief: both are alive and jumping. This may sound like a bizarre reaction to a picture of two boys bouncing exuberantly on a trampoline in South Africa against a blue sky filled with high-flying clouds. But if you saw the exhibition in which the photograph hangs, ''James Nachtwey: Testimony'' at the International Center of Photography, or Mr. Nachtwey's new book of photographs, ''Inferno'' (Phaidon, 2000), you might have the same response.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Nachtwey's photographs, the boundary between living and dead is slim. The line between ecstasy and grief is almost invisible. It is hard to tell whether people are covering their eyes from dust or from terror, whether a piece of plastic is a rain cover or a body bag. And then there are the bodies. Some of the living are limbless torsoes and others are sacks of crawling bones. Some of the dead are tossed together in postures too intimate for the living. When you see legs dangling, the first response is a shudder. What is the status of the bodies they belong to?</p>

        <p>In the photograph you see a boy flying, head first, toward the ground, and another boy falling fast feet first. At first you hope the boys are alive, and then you hope they are dead. Finally you breathe a sigh of relief: both are alive and jumping. This may sound like a bizarre reaction to a picture of two boys bouncing exuberantly on a trampoline in South Africa against a blue sky filled with high-flying clouds. But if you saw the exhibition in which the photograph hangs, ''James Nachtwey: Testimony'' at the International Center of Photography, or Mr. Nachtwey's new book of photographs, ''Inferno'' (Phaidon, 2000), you might have the same response.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Nachtwey's photographs, the boundary between living and dead is slim. The line between ecstasy and grief is almost invisible. It is hard to tell whether people are covering their eyes from dust or from terror, whether a piece of plastic is a rain cover or a body bag. And then there are the bodies. Some of the living are limbless torsoes and others are sacks of crawling bones. Some of the dead are tossed together in postures too intimate for the living. When you see legs dangling, the first response is a shudder. What is the status of the bodies they belong to?</p>
        <p>You have to look very closely at these photographs, then read the captions and look at the photographs again to try to decipher exactly what horror they depict.</p>
        <p>A man in Chechnya whose body is being rolled over by some anonymous hands looks as if he were wincing at being moved. In fact, he is being prepared for his funeral. A photograph that appears to show a large plastic body bag full of people, with a hand here, a shirt there, visible beneath the cover, turns out to be a picture of some Kosovar deportees on the Albanian border with a large sheet of plastic over their tractor.</p>
        <p>A photograph in Zaire shows one man leaning near a truck and another on its tire. They aren't resting; they are dead. A photograph in Indonesia shows a pile of bodies, some with their eyes shut, some with their hands raised, and some with their mouths covered with a pasty white substance. They are not dead or crying. They are students celebrating Suharto's resignation in 1998.</p>
        <p>In looking at Mr. Nachtwey's photographs you perform a kind of visual triage. You must sort the dead from the living, sometimes the animal from the human. A lineup of smiling skulls in Afghanistan turns out to be goat heads in the window of a Kabul cafe. A skeleton crawling in the dust is a living man. Some bone-thin Tutsi arranged in sleeping attitudes have been massacred. Mr. Nachtwey's photographs are relentlessly gut-wrenching, almost impossible to look at. Yet if you want to see what is going on in them, they require a long and strangely dispassionate kind of looking.</p>
        <p>You must search not only the victims' bodies but also the landscape for the telltale trail of blood, or the expression on an onlooker's face, to judge whether the bodies are dead, wounded or only sleeping. When you see one Zairian eye staring out of a circle of cholera victims wrapped in mats and blankets, you find yourself thinking about the differences between a live eye and a dead one. In ''Inferno,'' a sequence of photographs of a man shot in Chechnya shows his body being stripped of cigarettes and hat. Studying these photographs to account for the stolen goods makes you feel like one more robber.</p>
        <p>It is not only the subject of the photographs that gives them an inescapable horror. It is also their size. Many of the colored and black-and-white pictures in the exhibition, which covers Mr. Nachtwey's work since the 1980's, are very large, 30 by 40 inches. The book ''Inferno,'' which has some of the same photographs as the exhibition, is huge, too. It is 2 1/2 inches deep, 11 inches wide and 15 inches long, and is heavy with the last decade's atrocities: Romania, Somalia, India, the Sudan, Bosnia, Rwanda, Zaire and Chechnya. That the book is gorgeously produced (and costs $125) seems almost grotesque.</p>
        <p>The bigness is intentional. Mr. Nachtwey, who is 52 and a contributor to Time magazine, said in a telephone interview last week that he wanted his book ''to have pressure, gravity, to envelop people when they open its pages.'' He said he wanted people to ''see that something painful and unacceptable is going on with human beings.'' Maybe some viewers would have some influence over policy decisions. But by and large, ''I don't expect people to know what the solutions are,'' he said. ''There are elected officials charged with dealing with these things.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Natchwey's job is to witness. What kind of a witness is he? The title of his book, ''Inferno,'' was well chosen. Almost all of his photographs depict a hell on earth. Indeed some look uncannily like friezes cut straight from Rodin's ''Gates of Hell.'' A vertical picture of bodies piled high in Zaire shows some sitting in the laps of others and others head over heels. Mr. Nachtwey compares himself to Goya. ''I tried to do with a camera what he was doing with a brush.'' An atrocious artfulness governs his pictures.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nachtwey has captured an assortment of suffering and cruelty so varied and deep and wide that even at the most benign moments, even when two boys are bouncing joyfully on a trampoline, you have to doubt the humanity of humanity. There is something righteous in this vision but hopeless, too.</p>
        <p>That the living look as though they might be dying and the dying look as though they might be sleeping engenders the idea that death and brutality are the rule, the natural state. In this world, there is no paradise, no purgatory, only hell. And what is the good in looking at that? These photographs do not have the answer, but they certainly pose the question.</p>
        <p>''James Nachtwey: Testimony'' is at the International Center of Photography, Fifth Avenue at 94th Street, (212) 860-1777, through July 23.</p>
