        <p>A O Scott reviews documentary film The Children of Chabannes, about tiny French village where nearly 400 Jewish children were hidden from Nazis by Felix Chevrier, with help of villagers and two local teachers, Reine and Renee Paillassou, now in their 80's; filmmakers are Dean Wetherell and Lisa Gossels; latter's father and uncle were among rescued children (M)</p>

        <p>The tiny village of Chabannes, in the Creuse region of central France, is a quiet, obscure place, one of those corners of rural Europe that seem strangely untouched by the modern world. But 60 years ago Chabannes confronted 20th-century European brutality at its worst, and responded with unusual courage and humanity. The village served as a haven for nearly 400 Jewish children -- most of them refugees from Germany and Austria -- whom its citizens protected from the Nazis and from the betrayal of their own collaborationist government.</p>
        <p>''The Children of Chabannes,'' a documentary opening today at the Quad Cinema (it will also be shown on Sunday evening on the HBO Signature channel), was made by Lisa Gossels and Dean Wetherell; Ms. Gossels's father and uncle were among the rescued children. Inspired by her father's stories, and by a 1996 reunion of the children and their protectors, Ms. Gossels has constructed a moving record of the unassuming, uncompromising heroism of ordinary people.</p>

        <p>The tiny village of Chabannes, in the Creuse region of central France, is a quiet, obscure place, one of those corners of rural Europe that seem strangely untouched by the modern world. But 60 years ago Chabannes confronted 20th-century European brutality at its worst, and responded with unusual courage and humanity. The village served as a haven for nearly 400 Jewish children -- most of them refugees from Germany and Austria -- whom its citizens protected from the Nazis and from the betrayal of their own collaborationist government.</p>
        <p>''The Children of Chabannes,'' a documentary opening today at the Quad Cinema (it will also be shown on Sunday evening on the HBO Signature channel), was made by Lisa Gossels and Dean Wetherell; Ms. Gossels's father and uncle were among the rescued children. Inspired by her father's stories, and by a 1996 reunion of the children and their protectors, Ms. Gossels has constructed a moving record of the unassuming, uncompromising heroism of ordinary people.</p>
        <p>The children were brought to Chabannes by a Jewish social-service organization, Ouvre de Secours aux Enfants, and housed at the local chateau. Their sanctuary was administered by Felix Chevrier, whose stubbornness and charisma make him a powerful presence in the film, even though he died in 1962. Chevrier, a Freemason, was also a staunch embodiment of the French republican tradition.</p>
        <p>His adherence to the enlightenment tenets of universalism and human rights was shared by many of the villagers, for whom the embrace of endangered foreigners was an essentially patriotic act. His eloquent, sarcastic letters to the local authorities, read aloud by one of his old friends, are nearly as powerful as the singing of ''La Marseillaise'' in ''Casablanca.''</p>
        <p>Chevrier, who recorded the children's activities in journals and photographs, managed to ensure the survival of his charges even when the Vichy government began rounding up Jews for deportation to the Nazi camps. He was aided by Reine and Renee Paillassou, local schoolteachers now in their 80's, whose pluck is still evident, and by the tough, pragmatic members of the Jewish organization.</p>
        <p>At enormous personal risk they managed to create something like a normal life, with daily calisthenics, mushroom-hunting trips into the forest (where they would later hide from the police) and lessons taught with proper Gallic rigor. The surviving children, most of whom live in the United States and France, look back on their time in Chabannes with fondness and amazement. The Chabannais preserved not only their lives but, more remarkably, their childhoods as well.</p>
        <p>The survival of a few hundred children hardly mitigates the horror of the Holocaust, and this comparatively happy tale can be understood only with reference to the horrors of its context. These have been documented in epochal, large-scale films like ''Shoah'' and ''The Sorrow and the Pity.'' But the cinematic fulfillment of the imperative to remember has more recently been taken up in smaller, more individuated acts of commemoration. ''Children of Chabannes,'' an honest, careful film, is a fine example of this tendency.</p>
