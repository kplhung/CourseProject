        <p>With the sale of 21 potential oil-producing areas on and offshore, Brazil has taken a major step toward reducing its dependence on energy imports -- even as the country gives foreign petroleum companies a greater role.</p>
        <p>It is still too soon to tell how much Brazil's oil production will increase because of the concessions that were auctioned by the government on Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro, attracting bidders from all over the world. But as a result, the domestic petroleum industry is expected to receive as much as $1 billion in technology and infrastructure investment over the next several years.</p>
        <p>''No one can think about growth without energy,'' said the Brazilian vice president, Marco Maciel, whose presence at the auction underlined the government's commitment to modernize the oil industry in Brazil, Latin America's largest economy.</p>
        <p>The nation imported an average of 339,000 barrels of oil a day last year -- about a third of its oil needs -- spending $2 billion. This year, with the surge in crude oil prices, Brazil's spending on imported petroleum will be far more. And with a growing population and an expanding industrial base, Brazil has been struggling to meet new demand for oil.</p>
        <p>Petroleum industry experts said the auction, where international oil companies spent $262 million to buy 9 onshore and 12 offshore concessions, was a forward step for Brazil's ambition of energy autonomy and an important vote of confidence in the opening of Brazil's petroleum industry, which until two years ago was dominated by the state-owned company Petroleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras.</p>
        <p>To attract foreign investment and help expand exploration and drilling, the Brazilian Congress voted to open the oil industry in 1997, after a protracted battle with nationalists, who feared excessive foreign influence over a strategic resource.</p>
        <p>A new regulatory body, the National Petroleum Agency, forced Petrobras to give up the rights to potential oil finds that it lacked the resources to develop. Even with that stricture, the company kept 397 areas and has since signed a number of joint venture agreements with multinational oil companies to develop the sites.</p>
        <p>Last June, the government auctioned the first set of concession areas that were relinquished by Petrobras, earning $178 million. Although the government considered the effort a success, only 12 of the 27 blocks on offer were sold, partly because of economic uncertainty caused by the devaluation of Brazil's currency, the real, early in 1999. The sales were also hampered by some concern about the government's commitment to free competition in a country where, until a few years ago, many major industries had been state-run.</p>
        <p>''The timing of the first round didn't give time for a lot of people to assimilate what the changes in the Brazilian market meant,'' said Martin Jones, general manager in Brazil for Amerada Hess. ''We are now moving from the theory of investing in Brazil to the practice of investing in Brazil.''</p>
        <p>While partly relying on high oil prices to invigorate interest in the auction, the government this time around also relaxed some bidding restrictions to attract smaller domestic and foreign investors.</p>
        <p>Although there was a larger pool of bidders in this round, Petrobras still emerged as the big winner, buying seven of the concessions and participation in an eighth. The company surprised auction participants by offering winning bids of $56 million and $89 million on two offshore blocks in the Santos basin, where it already has operating wells.</p>
        <p>There was some grumbling about the strong Petrobras showing. Critics said the company benefited from an insider's knowledge of the local oil fields.</p>
        <p>''I gave a very competitive bid, but it wasn't good enough,'' said Victor Dauzacker, the representative in Brazil for Fay Richwhite Holding Ltd., which was outbid for an onshore concession by Petrobras.</p>
        <p>In an effort to bring more companies into the Brazilian oil industry, Petrobras plans to auction 73 mature fields -- those with declining production in the northeast of the country -- on a date to be announced in July. The National Petroleum Agency also plans to auction a third round of concession areas in 2001.</p>
