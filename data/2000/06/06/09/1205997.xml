        <p>The 1999-2000 Devils, who played tonight for the Stanley Cup in Continental Arena, are a well-crafted collection of players of different age groups, talents and nationalities.

        <p>The 1999-2000 Devils, who played tonight for the Stanley Cup in Continental Arena, are a well-crafted collection of players of different age groups, talents and nationalities. Although still perceived by some as having a one-dimensional roster of anonymous automatons who lack flair and creativity, the Devils of this season are more versatile and interesting than the group that won the franchise's first title in 1995.</p>
        <p>Half the players who dressed for tonight's game have worn no other uniform in the National Hockey League. Another five have at least five years with the team. This alone is uncommon in an era of free agency and trade-happy management, and it is a credit to the vision of Lou Lamoriello, the general manager who assembled the team. Although some Devils overlap into more than one category, the roster can be seen as a whole composed of distinct groups.</p>
        <p>THE VETERAN LEADERS Scott Stevens, Ken Daneyko, Claude Lemieux, Bobby Holik, Randy McKay, Sergei Nemchinov and Martin Brodeur. Of this group, only Daneyko and Brodeur began with the Devils. Stevens, the captain, joined the team in 1991 and is a strong candidate for the Conn Smythe trophy as most valuable player in the tournament. McKay, who accepted a fourth-line role this series, arrived that same season.</p>
        <p>If this team were a college squad, these seven would make up the senior class. The goalie Brodeur, like the defenseman Stevens, leads by example. Even at his worst, as Brodeur was for part of the Eastern Conference finals against Philadelphia, he maintained a calm disposition and refused to dwell on negative things.</p>
        <p>Nemchinov, 36, is in his ninth N.H.L. season and with his third team in the New York metropolitan area. He had a decade of experience in the Soviet Union before joining the Rangers in 1991 and helping them to a Stanley Cup in 1994. A quiet man who is pleasant but painfully shy with the news media, Nemchinov serves as a link between the other three Russians on the roster and Slava Fetisov, the assistant coach. Like Holik, Lemieux and McKay, Nemchinov is a role player.</p>
        <p>THE YOUNG VIRTUOSOS Jason Arnott, Petr Sykora and Patrik Elias. Arnott arrived in a trade with Edmonton and the other two were drafted by Lamoriello. They are from the Czech Republic, as is Holik. Like many Devils, Sykora and Elias paid their dues in the minors, the junior varsity of Lamoriello's athletic department.</p>
        <p>These three make up one of the N.H.L.'s most interesting and creative forward lines. But when they get too bold, and take too many chances, their coach, Larry Robinson, may scold them, as he did, in public statements, during these finals.</p>
        <p>It is this line that makes the Devils much more explosive and entertaining than Jacques Lemaire's champions of 1995.</p>
        <p>THE ROOKIES Much is made about these four, and for good reason. Scott Gomez, Brian Rafalski, Colin White and John Madden play many important minutes. Gomez and Rafalski are Americans, as are Jay Pandolfo and Chris Terreri. Lamoriello is an American. Less than half of the other general managers in the N.H.L. are. He had a dozen Yanks on his 1995 roster. And he has always been among the most progressive and alert executives for identifying and acquiring European talent as well as collegiate players from the United States.</p>
        <p>Rafalski and Madden were undrafted and their signings were a credit to Lamoriello's scouting staff, which has a knack for identifying players with a hunger to go with their overlooked skills. Rafalski, smaller than most defensemen, has speed and puck-handling abilities that blend well on a defensive tandem with Stevens, a big guy who delivers big hits. Madden is an extraordinary penalty-killer and a checking specialist whose command of gritty detail exceeds that found in many veterans.</p>
        <p>Gomez, the probable winner of the Calder trophy as rookie of the year, is brilliantly creative on attack and could also fit in the young virtuosos category. His package is not yet complete and Robinson seems to know how to maximize his best qualities while minimizing his deficiencies. White, a big defenseman from Nova Scotia, was a fifth-round draft choice who spent almost three years in the minors. He is a devil's Devil.</p>
        <p>THE RECENT RUSSIANS Joining Nemchinov and Sergei Brylin late this season were Alexander Mogilny, a right wing, and Vladimir Malakhov, a defenseman. Both are elite talents acquired in the kind of trades made by a general manager who knows his team has a chance for a championship.</p>
        <p>Both are high-salaried, and their critics labeled them high-maintenance and enigmatic. Both were the last generation of ice artists from Viktor Tikhonov's Central Red Army system. Would they ever harness their brilliant skills into a team-first format? They have with the Devils, perhaps only in the short term, as members of the supporting cast.</p>
        <p>No formula includes everyone. This one left out Scott Niedermayer, an attacking defenseman who is part veteran leader, part young virtuoso, a nine-year veteran at age 27. Just as some players overlap two categories now, others will move from one to another as the roster evolves in the future. It is likely that a half-dozen will be gone by Game 1 in the fall.</p>
        <p>But at the moment, they make up a championship contender that represents what the N.H.L. looks like at the start of the 21st century. It was assembled by a general manager who combines old-fashioned values with progressive recruiting -- and a willingness to change coaches right before the playoffs because it was the right thing to do.</p>
