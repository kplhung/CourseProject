        <p>THERE is a riddle that used to appear in magazines like Highlights for Children and Boys' Life, asking readers to name the only day of the year that can also be a sentence. The answer: March Fourth.</p>
        <p>Back up the calendar three days and you have the name of a recently formed company, offering a variety of Internet professional services, that seeks to solve another riddle: how to stand out amid competitors ranging from management consultants to advertising agencies to Web site builders. The company, called MarchFirst Inc., is hoping the right answer will be an extensive -- and expensive -- offline and online media campaign centered on a celebration of being, well, first.</p>
        <p>MarchFirst began operations on, yes, March 1, with the completion of the merger of the USWeb/CKS Group, a Web services company, and Whittman-Hart, an Internet consulting firm. A brief ''teaser'' campaign ran in newspapers to introduce the name, which was created by staff members at McKinney &amp; Silver, the ad agency unit of USWeb/CKS perhaps best known for its work for the Audi automobiles sold by Volkswagen of America.</p>
        <p>The second, much larger, phase of the MarchFirst campaign, also produced by McKinney &amp; Silver, is to begin on Monday with ads in daily and weekly newspapers. Ads in business, trade and lifestyle magazines will follow later in the month along with TV commercials on sports and other programming. The online portion includes a Web site to go up on Monday (www.marchfirst.com).</p>
        <p>The budget for the entire campaign, carrying the theme ''A new company for the new economy,'' is $50 million.</p>
        <p>''It's tough to cut through all the clutter,'' said Robert Bernard, chairman and chief executive at MarchFirst in Chicago, particularly, he said, when dozens of dot-coms are striving to establish themselves in the business-to-business and business-to-consumer realms.</p>
        <p>''It's very important for us to get the name out there, to create a strong brand awareness,'' Mr. Bernard said, adding that basing the campaign on ''the human desire to be first'' would accomplish that ''because people will be attracted to the emotion, the heart.''</p>
        <p>''It's not just about crossing a finish line first,'' he added, ''but also about tackling problems, taking risks, taking on challenges.''</p>
        <p>The device the campaign uses to gain attention is to demonstrate the effects of famous firsts rather than portray the causes. For instance, a print ad captioned ''The first rock star'' shows not Chuck Berry or Elvis Presley or Bill Haley but screaming, sobbing fans pressed against a chain-link fence.</p>
        <p>''Here's to being first,'' the text reads. ''Here's to leading.''</p>
        <p>A second print ad, captioned ''The first cubist exhibition,'' displays not ''Nude Descending a Staircase'' but a gallery of men and women staring, glaring and even tilting their heads.</p>
        <p>''It's good to be first,'' the text reads, promoting MarchFirst as providing businesses with ''a new way of thinking.''</p>
        <p>The TV commercials are to present the effects of events like the wearing of the first miniskirt, as passers-by are seen registering shock and surprise; the first man on the moon, as a family watching television is glimpsed crying and cheering; and the first expedition to the South Pole, as penguins are shown turning their heads in unison from left to right as if they were humans at a tennis match.</p>
        <p>''The power is in the effects these firsts had in moving society,'' said David Baldwin, senior vice president and executive creative director at McKinney &amp; Silver.</p>
        <p>''We could have said: 'MarchFirst. Integrated solutions for your many needs,' '' he added, laughing. ''But it's better to say we're making sure MarchFirst is always trying to win for clients and employees.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, said Sara Cavin, executive vice president for marketing, the campaign is aimed at MarchFirst's employees -- current and prospective -- as much as existing and potential customers.</p>
        <p>''We're constantly 're-recruiting' our employees to make sure they've an understanding of what we do,'' Ms. Cavin said. That is crucial because MarchFirst, with 9,000 employees at 70 offices in 14 countries, does so much: creating traditional advertising; building and putting up Web sites; offering brand and corporate identity consulting and strategic positioning; and installing so-called front-end and back-end technology services.</p>
        <p>Whether or not you like the company's unusual name, it offers one major advantage, according to Mr. Bernard: ''Every year, we can celebrate our anniversary.''</p>
