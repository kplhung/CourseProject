        <p>Criticizing Washington for what he termed ''too much needless division,'' Gov. George W. Bush proposed a wide-ranging overhaul of the federal budget process today in an effort to avoid the bitter annual standoffs between Congress and the president over taxes and spending.</p>

        <p>Criticizing Washington for what he termed ''too much needless division,'' Gov. George W. Bush proposed a wide-ranging overhaul of the federal budget process today in an effort to avoid the bitter annual standoffs between Congress and the president over taxes and spending.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush put at the center of his plan a call for the president and Congress to shift from an annual budget cycle to a biennial process like the one in his home state, Texas. ''If the discord in Washington never seems to end, this is partly because the budget process never seems to end,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Such a plan, however, was narrowly defeated in the Republican-dominated House just last month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, also called for a new effort to pass legislation giving the president line-item veto power. And he asked for a change in budget procedures to require the president to sign the annual spring budget resolution, which currently is the work of Congress alone.</p>
        <p>''I do not dismiss the serious disagreements that are part of the political process,'' Mr. Bush said, ''but the reality is that Americans look upon this spectacle in Washington and they don't like what they see.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's proposal for structural changes came against the backdrop of five and a half tumultuous years of partisan bickering between President Clinton and the Republican Congress that was elected in 1994. The years have brought the government shutdown of 1995, President Clinton's impeachment, stalled nominations and gridlock over policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said there was ''enough blame to go around.'' But appearing in the home state of Vice President Al Gore, his Democratic opponent, he leveled most of his criticism at the Clinton administration, particularly at Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush denounced the tone of Mr. Gore's responses to his policy proposals, particularly one to divert some Social Security payroll taxes into individual investment accounts.</p>
        <p>''Ideas he doesn't share are never just the other side of the issue,'' Mr. Bush said. ''They're called reckless or radical. Proposals he disapproves of are never just arguable, they are always 'risky schemes.' This unnecessary rhetoric is characteristic of the tone in Washington, D.C. It's the war room mentality: the hostile stance, the harsh charges, the lashing out at enemies. We have had eight years of this, and eight years is enough.''</p>
        <p>On Mr. Clinton he was more muted. ''With just seven months until the end of his term, we will leave our current president to the judgment of history. What matters now is whether the bitterness that now prevails in Washington will continue after his term.''</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign, which has recently toned down much of its criticism of Mr. Bush, said the governor was trying to duck serious debate. ''This rhetoric is Governor Bush's way of avoiding real debate on issues such as his plan to privatize Social Security,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>With his appearance today, Mr. Bush continued the reliance on policy speeches that have marked his campaign this spring and that he and his advisers believe help him draw a contrast with Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's speech allowed him to compete with Mr. Gore on one of the vice president's trademark issues -- ''reinventing government'' -- and it also borrowed from Mr. Bush's Republican primary opponent, Senator John McCain, who crusaded against pork barrel spending.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush proposed the creation of a bipartisan legislative commission that would comb spending bills for pork barrel projects, combine them into one list and require Congress to vote on the entire package.</p>
        <p>Many of the governor's ideas were not new. President Clinton also sought line-item veto powers, and Congress passed such a law in 1996. But two years later the Supreme Court held that it had unconstitutionally granted the president unilateral power to change statutes, and it struck down the law.</p>
        <p>Stephen Goldsmith, Mr. Bush's chief domestic policy adviser, said the campaign had consulted with Constitutional experts and believed line-item veto legislation could be rewritten to meet Constitutional muster.</p>
        <p>Both the Clinton administration and the Republican Congressional leadership also support biennial budgeting. Although Republicans like Representative Bill Archer, who heads the Ways and Means Committee, and Speaker J. Dennis Hastert support the idea, such a plan was defeated 217-201 in the House last month. The opponents, mostly Democrats, said it would reduce Congress to fiscal lame ducks, unable to exercise authority over federal agencies. A proposal like Mr. Bush's to have the president sign the Congressional budget resolution was also defeated in the House, 250-166.</p>
        <p>Currently, the budget resolution is enacted solely by Congress, which means that many domestic policy disputes between the president and lawmakers are shifted to autumn battles over individual spending and tax bills. The struggle takes place against the deadline of the new federal fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush argued that changing the budget process to a two-year cycle would allow Congress to be less consumed with budgeting and to focus on oversight and other business in the off years. Under his proposal, budgeting would take place in the years when lawmakers are not running for re-election.</p>
        <p>He told reporters on his campaign plane that a two-year cycle would encourage less spending because lawmakers would not want to overestimate revenues that might not materialize in the second year. ''It will create more fiscally conservative thinking,'' he said. ''It's hard to spend money you're not sure you're going to have.''</p>
        <p>And he said that requiring the president to sign the budget resolution would force negotiations early on a budget framework. He said that would lead to agreement on a fundamental budget framework and less friction over the 13 individual spending bills needed to enact the budget and keep the government running.</p>
        <p>To head off the threat of a government shutdown, Mr. Bush proposed that if spending bills were not passed by the start of the fiscal year, spending would continue at whatever was lowest: the previous year's levels or levels proposed by the president's budget.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also urged the Senate to take no more than 60 days to act on presidential nominees. The delays have become so severe that during the Clinton administration 44 percent of nominations took more than six months to come before the Senate, and some have been stalled for years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said Senate confirmation hearings had become too partisan. ''Often,'' he said, ''they are occasions for pushing a larger agenda having nothing to do with the merits of the nominee. At some memorable low points, hearings have become a gantlet of accusation, interest group warfare and public humiliation. And this has done too much harm to the process.''</p>
