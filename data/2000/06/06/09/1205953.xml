        <p>A lawyer for a 17-year-old mother charged with throwing her baby into the Passaic River Saturday night said today that she had been forced to leave home two years ago and was recently depressed and suffering from memory lapses.</p>
        <p>''I think this is a very troubled young lady,'' the lawyer, Anthony Fusco, said after a brief court hearing on the charge that his client murdered her 16-month-old son. ''What's going on in her mind right now, God only knows. I'm not so sure even she knows why she did this.''</p>

        <p>A lawyer for a 17-year-old mother charged with throwing her baby into the Passaic River Saturday night said today that she had been forced to leave home two years ago and was recently depressed and suffering from memory lapses.</p>
        <p>''I think this is a very troubled young lady,'' the lawyer, Anthony Fusco, said after a brief court hearing on the charge that his client murdered her 16-month-old son. ''What's going on in her mind right now, God only knows. I'm not so sure even she knows why she did this.''</p>
        <p>During the hearing, in the family division of State Superior Court, Mr. Fusco conceded that the woman, whose name was not released because of her age, told Paterson detectives early Monday that she had dropped the baby into the river from a footbridge. In a move that blocked prosecutors from discussing the statement that she gave the police in open court, Mr. Fusco waived his client's legal right to learn about evidence supporting the murder charge during the hearing. He also received permission from the presiding judge, Nestor Guzman, for a psychiatric examination of the mother.</p>
        <p>Later, outside of court, Mr. Fusco said he would consider an insanity defense if the Passaic County prosecutor attempted to try the teenager as an adult. An assistant Passaic County prosecutor, Lisa Verlardi, told the judge that her office was considering trying the mother as an adult.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fusco's portrayal of the young woman's life today was less positive than the account her cousin gave on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fusco said that the woman's life had been stormy. Her parents are divorced and her mother is being treated for severe schizophrenia, he said. In the spring of 1998, about the time she became pregnant with the baby she is accused of killing, she was told to leave home, Mr. Fusco said. He declined to explain why, but said the pregnancy was not the reason. Later, the teenager's sister became her legal guardian,  and she moved in with an aunt and her cousin Wanda Cruz, he said.</p>
        <p>The woman dropped out of high school in November 1998, two months before her son was born. She and the father of the child, who never married, dated for several months after the baby's birth, Ms. Cruz said Wednesday. In recent months, she had begun evening classes in hopes of receiving a high school equivalency diploma and becoming a nurse's aide, she added.</p>
        <p>Former co-workers at a department store in Wayne said the woman left a sales clerk job about two months ago to take a higher-paying office job, but Mr. Fusco said she was unemployed in recent months and had been depressed, with mood swings that had become more severe. ''She can remember certain things, but she doesn't remember a lot of things,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He scoffed at prosecutors' accusation that she threw the baby into the river because she wanted to visit a new boyfriend and was unable to find a baby sitter.</p>
        <p>''There certainly were people who were available for that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>An autopsy determined today that the baby, named Anthony, died of asphyxiation by drowning, said Boris Moczula, first assistant Passaic County prosecutor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fusco said he told the woman this morning that the baby's body had been found on Wednesday, about three miles downstream from the footbridge.</p>
        <p>''Her color in her face just left it,'' he said. ''It was instant tears.''</p>
