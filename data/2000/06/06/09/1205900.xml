        <p>George Bush will be featured in a new commercial that is to run in New York on Sunday. No, not that George Bush, and not the other one, either. This is George P. Bush, the 23-year-old nephew of the presumptive Republican candidate and a budding star of the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>The new spot, produced in Spanish and in English -- George P. is fluent in both, campaign advisers say -- is being released to coincide with the staging on Sunday of the Puerto Rican Day Parade in Manhattan, in which the younger Mr. Bush is also scheduled to participate.</p>

        <p>George Bush will be featured in a new commercial that is to run in New York on Sunday. No, not that George Bush, and not the other one, either. This is George P. Bush, the 23-year-old nephew of the presumptive Republican candidate and a budding star of the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>The new spot, produced in Spanish and in English -- George P. is fluent in both, campaign advisers say -- is being released to coincide with the staging on Sunday of the Puerto Rican Day Parade in Manhattan, in which the younger Mr. Bush is also scheduled to participate.</p>
        <p>In the commercial, the young man, the son of the candidate's brother Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and his Mexican-born wife, Columba, talks about how his uncle is reaching out to voters of diverse backgrounds, Bush strategists say. But they add that his good looks could also help draw in younger voters.</p>
        <p>''He's able to deliver a message in a very natural way, and is, in fact, not only a handsome young man, but also totally Latino-looking and as proficient in Spanish as he is in English,'' said Lionel Sosa, a San Antonio advertising man and an architect of Gov. George W. Bush's marketing campaign directed at Hispanic voters.</p>
        <p>Republicans are making an aggressive pitch this year for the Hispanic vote, long seen as reliably Democratic, in part because Mr. Bush has been successful in winning Spanish-speaking voters in Texas. In Fresno, Calif., several weeks ago, the Republican National Committee spent about $150,000 on a test run of a commercial intended to attract voters of Latin American descent.</p>
        <p>Advertising time in New York for the English-language spot was bought during WNBC's coverage of the parade, and the Spanish-language version will be broadcast on the Telemundo network, Mr. Sosa said.</p>
        <p>He added that he recognized the telegenic potential of George P., who is to begin law school in the fall, when he saw him work the crowd at a meeting with farm workers in San Bernardino, Calif.</p>
        <p>People there were so taken with him, Mr. Sosa said, ''they forgot he was a Republican.''</p>
