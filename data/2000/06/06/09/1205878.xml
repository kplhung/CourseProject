        <p>Let the punning begin: ''The Full Monty'' is coming to Broadway.</p>
        <p>Barely a week after opening in San Diego, the producers of ''The Full Monty,'' the musical adaptation of the 1997 hit film about a group of British lads who take to stripping to make the rent, have announced they will open at the Eugene O'Neill Theater on Oct. 26. Previews begin on Sept. 26. Expect the bad wordplay to start almost immediately.</p>
        <p>The show, with music and lyrics by David Yazbek and a book by Terrence McNally, opened on June 1 at the Old Globe Theater and promptly broke box-office records for that 612-seat theater. Jack O'Brien, the artistic director of the Old Globe, will also direct the Broadway staging.</p>
        <p>West Coast critics hailed the musical as a fun, if still flawed, production; The Los Angeles Times said the show was a ''raucous, uneven, highly entertaining musical comedy'' that had the potential to be a big hit with a little work.</p>
        <p>That tinkering has already begun, said Mr. McNally, with rewrites under way and due to be worked in next week. The musical had only a week's worth of previews before opening in San Diego, meaning there was little time to work out the kinks.</p>
        <p>''The plan is to have the show frozen by the time we leave there,'' Mr. McNally said.</p>
        <p>To create a musical for an American audience, Mr. McNally, who won a Tony for his book for ''Ragtime,'' transposed the action from Sheffield, the city in northern England where the film was set, to Buffalo. He also discarded all of the movie's dialogue in favor of new American lines. ''The characters in the movie had really strong accents,'' he said. ''I got tired of hitting the rewind on the video player.''</p>
        <p>As for the show's nudity, Mr. McNally said he wouldn't disclose how it was handled. Will the audience get to see the actors' whole kit and caboodle?</p>
        <p>''We do it different than the movie,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But how different? ''The movie cuts to the back and freezes if I remember correctly,'' he said. ''You can't cut to the back in a play.''</p>
        <p>Change at Encores!</p>
        <p>It is, to an extent, the price of success: Kathleen Marshall, the artistic director of the Encores! concert series at City Center, is stepping down.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marshall, who has held the job since 1996, said yesterday that while she would stay on at Encores! as director in residence, other commitments were making it difficult to balance her time.</p>
        <p>''They've been so wonderful about allowing me to do other projects,'' Ms. Marshall said. ''I didn't want to stretch the bond so thin that I couldn't do a good job.''</p>
        <p>This season alone, Ms. Marshall directed the New York premiere of Stephen Sondheim's ''Saturday Night'' and choreographed ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' for which she received a Tony nomination.</p>
        <p>Those jobs, of course, are in part a result of Ms. Marshall's strong work on Encores! shows like ''Babes in Arms,'' ''Li'l Abner'' and ''The Boys From Syracuse.'' In recognition, Encores!, which is devoted to staging lost or rarely seen musicals, was awarded with a special Tony for excellence on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marshall's successor will be Jack Viertel, the creative director of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns five Broadway houses. Mr. Viertel, 51, has had an eclectic career, ranging from time spent as Bonnie Raitt's guitarist to a stint as a theater critic to his more recent role as an aesthetic shepherd for such shows as ''Guys and Dolls'' and ''The Sound of Music.''</p>
        <p>He says his love for the American musical began early.</p>
        <p>''My professional career started out at age 5 conducting the overture from 'Tenderloin' in front of the record player,'' he said. ''Not many guys can say that.''</p>
        <p>'Merchant' Logistics</p>
        <p>The prospect of the Royal National Theater's highly praised production of ''The Merchant of Venice,'' with Henry Goodman, coming to New York is looking less and less likely. The play, directed in London by Trevor Nunn, was expected to arrive on Broadway in the fall. But Mr. Nunn's current commitment to stage ''Oklahoma!'' on Broadway by the end of the year seems to have made transferring ''Merchant'' during that same period tricky.</p>
        <p>Lucinda Morrison, the National's press representative, said yesterday that no formal decision had been made but conceded that ''there are a lot of logistic difficulties in the way.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill's College Paper</p>
        <p>The Playwrights Theater, which has committed itself to producing the entire canon of Eugene O'Neill, will produce another little-known work of his this summer: ''The Personal Equation.''</p>
        <p>The full-length play, written by O'Neill in 1915 for a play-writing class while he was a student at Harvard, concentrates on a seamen's strike led by an Emma Goldman-like character, according to ''O'Neill,'' a biography by Arthur and Barbara Gelb.</p>
        <p>The Playwrights Theater production will star Ralph Waite and his son Liam and is to run from Aug. 4 to 19 at the Provincetown Playhouse in Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>Like many of the plays O'Neill wrote during his Harvard days, ''The Personal Equation'' wasn't among his favorites. (''O'Neill'' says he often called his Harvard plays rotten.) But Stephen Kennedy Murphy, the Playwrights' artistic director, said he saw promise in O'Neill's juvenilia.</p>
        <p>''They don't really jump off the page as great works,'' he said. ''But staged, you can see the vitality.''</p>
        <p>Along the Way</p>
        <p>*''Jitney,'' the revival of August Wilson's 1979 play about a group of livery cab drivers in 1970's Pittsburgh, has extended its run at Second Stage for a second time, to Sept. 3. The production was named the best play of the year by the New York Drama Critics.</p>
        <p>*The gig is up for ''The Bomb-Itty of Errors,'' the downtown hip-hop adaptation of ''The Comedy of Errors.'' The show, running since December at the Salon at 45 Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, will close on June 18.</p>
        <p>* Eric Idle, a Monty Python founder and co-conceiver of the coming Broadway musical ''Seussical,'' will try things solo for two nights, June 27-28, at Carnegie Hall.</p>
