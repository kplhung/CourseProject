        <p>A Staten Island bank is giving its name -- and $400,000 a year for at least nine years -- to the new stadium that will house the Staten Island Yankees.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, at the stadium's groundbreaking yesterday, said money from the bank, Richmond County Bank, would be shared by the city, which will own the stadium, and the Yankees. In exchange, Mr. Giuliani said, the stadium will be known as the Richmond County Bank Ballpark at St. George.</p>
        <p>The city has agreed to spend $71 million for parking, roads, shoreline reinforcement and the stadium itself, which is expected to be ready for opening day in 2001.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's ceremony on Staten Island, coming at a time when the city has also begun construction of a minor league stadium for the Mets along the Coney Island Boardwalk, provoked fresh criticism from financial analysts. Even though critics could be expected to welcome any private money for the project, the bank agreement hardly muted arguments that the city's investment is excessive, particularly in support of minor league teams.</p>
        <p>''There is no reason to believe a city's investment in a stadium will pay for itself in terms of economic development or tax revenues,'' said Ronnie Lowenstein, chief economist for the Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group.  She said the best that could be hoped  was that stadium projects ''shift economic activity across neighborhoods,'' perhaps benefiting the long-neglected neighborhoods of Coney Island and St. George.</p>
        <p>The city has projected that the Coney Island stadium, like the one on Staten Island, will be ready to open next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said that the Staten Island project had already increased real estate values in the St. George neighborhood, as investors and retail businesses moved in.</p>
        <p>''I am singing with joy,'' said Guy V. Molinari, the borough president. Mr. Molinari criticized City Hall through much of the 1980's for neglecting Staten Island in economic development projects, but he now finds his borough, and particularly St. George, among the city's biggest recipients of public projects.</p>
        <p>The city has budgeted $81 million to renovate the St. George Ferry Terminal and $20 million for a new National Lighthouse Museum, on land just east of the terminal.</p>
        <p>The team's general manager, Jeff Dumas, said yesterday that the sale of naming rights for the stadium was included in an agreement in which the city and the Yankees would split the $400,000 a year pledged by the bank, but he added that the bank's payments could rise in the future on the basis of factors like attendance and advertising.</p>
        <p>For use of the stadium, the Yankees have agreed to a 20-year lease, with yearly payments of up to $510,000, based on attendance.</p>
