        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The June 2 Public Lives column, about attempts by some City Council members to abolish the New York City Art Commission, reports hard feelings between Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern and me. As former president of the commission, I did have a serious and principled disagreement with Mr. Stern over the commission's right to have a say in projects that would have an aesthetic impact on city parks. But I harbor no ill will for Mr. Stern, and have contributed to several park projects.</p>

        <p>The 102-year-old Art Commission was founded to protect the long-term, aesthetic integrity of public spaces. It may not always make one popular, but one must protect the institution one has sworn to represent.</p>
