        <p>Near Lincoln Center</p>
        <p>In the past, finding a place to eat near Lincoln Center could be a chore, but the area now shows many signs of culinary life. Here are 12 places to enjoy before or after the symphony, the opera or the ballet. (These summaries are taken from dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times by William Grimes, Eric Asimov and others.)</p>
        <p>1. La Boite en Bois</p>
        <p>* [1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 874-2705</p>
        <p>75 West 68th Street</p>
        <p>$$ Cash only</p>
        <p>Pleasing, affordable bistro fare is offered here in a cozy brick-and-wood dining room. The menu includes appetizers like smoked salmon with chive sauce, seafood crepe with tomato coulis and frisee and endive salad with walnuts. Among the entrees at La Boite en Bois are grilled salmon with black olives and anchovy butter, fillet of red snapper baked in parchment and served with a saffron sauce, steak with peppercorn sauce, grilled quails on a bed of cranberry beans, and calf's liver topped with pearl onions and bacon.</p>
        <p>2. Brasserie Americaine</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 721-8271</p>
        <p>51 West 64th Street</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Brasserie Americaine has an Art Deco look and a raw bar. The menu gives brasserie classics like cassoulet an American touch. Starters include terrine of foie gras with brioche toast, tuna tartare served with caraway flatbread and fried calamari with garlic mayonnaise. Entrees include seared salmon with lentils and red wine sauce; vegetable risotto with white truffle oil; confit of duck, potato galette and aged vinegar sauce; and chateaubriand of tuna for two, served with watercress salad.</p>
        <p>3. Cafe Luxembourg</p>
        <p>** [2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 873-7411</p>
        <p>200 West 70th Street</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The Art Deco room here has a timeless appeal, with cream-colored tile walls, a black-and-white terrazzo floor, sconces and cafe tables. Patrons cluster at the long zinc-topped bar in the early evening. The dining room is a tightly arranged maze of red banquettes and rattan-style chairs. At night the room is soft and seductive. The seasonal menu is orchestrated to offer everything from simple salads and steaks to more refined creations. Dinner might begin with deep fried artichokes with olive tapenade, frisee aux lardons with Roquefort cheese and garlic croutons, or escargot with shiitake mushrooms and a parsley butter sauce. Among the main courses are seared yellowfin tuna with pesto sauce, chicken paillard with red pepper coulis, and grilled strip steak with crispy french fries.</p>
        <p>4. Gabriel's Bar And Restaurant</p>
        <p>** [2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 956-4600</p>
        <p>11 West 60th Street</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This clubby, comfortable restaurant with fabulous, friendly service serves Tuscan food in great big portions. Appetizers include wood-grilled sausage served over onions braised with caraway; a spicy soup of mussels steamed with white wine, tomato and hot pepper; and dandelion greens and endive salad with warm goat cheese with lemon and olive oil dressing. Entrees include wood-grilled tuna steak with fresh horseradish over roasted beets and sauteed spinach; sturgeon topped with chunky fennel vinaigrette served over roasted potatoes; and fillet of striped bass over pea sprouts and arugula, topped with marinated black olives and salsa verde, with potatoes roasted with onions and bread crumbs.</p>
        <p>5. Jean Georges</p>
        <p>**** [4 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 299-3900</p>
        <p>1 Central Park West, near 60th Street</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>In every aspect, from the austere design of the dining room to the pacing of the meal to the quiet professionalism of the staff, the focus at Jean-Georges Vongerichten's restaurant is on the food. The last touch of each dish is added at the table: a waiter composes young garlic soup, for example, ladling the aromatic broth over thyme, then adding sauteed frogs' legs, creating a blend of scents that is satisfying before you ever put spoon to mouth. Some dishes are simply seductive; others are bold, like sliced sea scallops topped with caramelized cauliflower and served in a caper-and-raisin emulsion. Not a single dish is less than triumphant at Jean Georges.</p>
        <p>6. John's Pizzeria</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 721-7001</p>
        <p>48 West 65th Street</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>John's earns its reputation for great pizza every day. It serves wonderful, thin, crisp-crust pizza with wonderful toppings, like bell peppers, spinach, ricotta cheese, meatballs and fresh garlic. It also serves Pete's-a-rolls, homemade dough stuffed with fresh sausage spiced with fennel; spinach with mozzarella; or peppers, onions, mushrooms and mozzarella. Pasta selections include stuffed shells, cavatelli, linguini aglio olio and fettuccini alle pesto. Sandwiches are served on toasted Italian bread; possible selections are chicken Milanese, meatball parmigiana and Italian sausage.</p>
        <p>7. Merlot Bar and Grill</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 363-7568</p>
        <p>48 West 63rd Street</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>An impressive wine list and acceptable French-American food are the hallmarks of this restaurant right across the street from Lincoln Center. Not surprisingly, given the restaurant's name, some 80 merlots are on the wine list, and 26 wines are offered by the glass. Appetizers include ginger-spiced tomato soup, Mediterranean spiced crab cakes, and smoked duck and asparagus salad. Among the entrees are spiced braised lamb shank, pepper-crusted yellowfin tuna and clay-pot-roasted blue mussels.</p>
        <p>8. Nick and Toni's Cafe</p>
        <p>** [2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 496-4000</p>
        <p>100 West 67th Street</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Nick and Toni's food starts with good ingredients and leaves them alone. And the details in this low-key restaurant are impeccable; the copper-topped bar, the bucolic murals and the wood-burning oven near the door give the room a cozy air. Appetizers include arugula and radicchio salad with golden beets and goat cheese; fried goat cheese with frisee and green olive tapenade; and baby spinach salad, with cremini mushrooms, Parmigiano-Reggiano and aged balsamic vinegar. Entrees include fresh handkerchief pasta with baby artichokes, wild mushrooms and ricotta salata; wood-oven-roasted whole fish with roasted baby zucchini, grilled fennel and red onion; and braised beef short ribs with soft polenta, roasted shallots and baby turnips.</p>
        <p>9. Picholine</p>
        <p>*** [3 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 724-8585</p>
        <p>35 West 64th Street</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Since Picholine opened in 1993 it has been one of the best restaurants around Lincoln Center, but that has not kept it from getting better and better. Terrance Brennan's menu reflects his love of the Mediterranean, and he goes far beyond simple, sunny foods with warm flavors. He does extraordinary things with foie gras and offers a different preparation every day. Salmon with a horseradish crust, one of his signature dishes, is excellent, as is loin of lamb with artichokes barigoule, olives and Parmesan-garlic flan. Desserts, like a pineapple carpaccio tart with coconut tapioca, candied lime and pineapple-lime granite, are great, but don't miss Picholine's extravagant cheese cart, worth considering if only to hear the lovingly detailed descriptions of each cheese. It's almost impossible not to order something.</p>
        <p>10. Sapphire Indian Cuisine</p>
        <p>++</p>
        <p>(212) 245-4444</p>
        <p>1845 Broadway, at 61st Street</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Sapphire, a newcomer in the neighborhood, may not be the last word in Indian cuisine, but it is good enough and good-looking enough to advance the cause. Chicken specialties include chicken sorpotel, cooked with roasted coconut and exotic spices; chicken saag, cooked with fresh spinach and spices; and chicken hara masala, cooked with fresh coriander, mint, green chilies and spices. Lamb specials include lamb rogan josh, cubes of meat stewed in aromatic spices and herbs, and lamb vindaloo, cubes marinated and cooked in a hot sauce.</p>
        <p>11. Shun Lee</p>
        <p>** [2 stars)</p>
        <p>(212) 769-3888</p>
        <p>43 West 65th Street</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Bigger than its East Side sibling and not nearly so elegant, Shun Lee and its dim sum cafe alongside can feel like a commissary right before curtain time. But when there is no rush, the kitchen can produce awesomely good Chinese food from many regions. The spareribs are long, meaty and almost fat-free; chicken soong mixes diced chicken with pine nuts and hoisin sauce, and ''ants climb on tree'' -- cellophane noodles mixed with slivers of beef and Chinese broccoli -- can be superb. Hunan calamari, scored and quickly cooked, and tiny hearts of Chinese cabbage in a gentle garlic sauce are two specialties. Whole live fish can be a tour de force.</p>
        <p>12. Vince and Eddie's</p>
        <p>* [1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 721-0068</p>
        <p>70 West 68th Street</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Done in a pastel farmhouse motif and decorated with antiques, this popular spot near Lincoln Center serves pleasing, homey American fare at reasonable prices. One might start with a plate of fried calamari and its cilantro-lime dipping sauce, warm herbed goat cheese on a mound of field greens, or a hearty lamb-barley soup. Main courses include grilled aged sirloin steak with fries; braised lamb shank served with cherry sauce and a turnip puree; grilled salmon with asparagus and mushroom sauce; roast chicken with lentils and sauteed spinach; and peppered seared tuna with sauteed spinach.</p>
