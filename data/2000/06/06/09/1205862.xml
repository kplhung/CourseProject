        <p>The Green Mile</p>
        <p>Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) recalls spiritual revelations when he was chief guard on death row in a Southern prison during the 1930's. A fastidious, compassionate man with a painful bladder infection, Edgecomb runs an orderly operation until the arrival of John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan, above), an enormous man convicted of rape and murder. Coffey seems as gentle as his crimes are heinous, and he is possessed with an inner power to cure maladies. Could he have committed such crimes?</p>

        <p>The Green Mile</p>
        <p>Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) recalls spiritual revelations when he was chief guard on death row in a Southern prison during the 1930's. A fastidious, compassionate man with a painful bladder infection, Edgecomb runs an orderly operation until the arrival of John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan, above), an enormous man convicted of rape and murder. Coffey seems as gentle as his crimes are heinous, and he is possessed with an inner power to cure maladies. Could he have committed such crimes?</p>
        <p>Adapted from Stephen King's novel, Frank Darabont's film, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ''boils down to a well-populated drama with a relatively simple story, one that could have been told with more economy and fewer talky bits.''</p>
        <p>1999. Warner. $109.99; DVD, 188 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: June 13.</p>
        <p>Bicentennial Man</p>
        <p>When the owner (Sam Neill) of an industrial robot named Andrew (Robin Williams) discovers that it has creative powers, he sets the machine up as a clockmaker. But Andrew longs to be a human and generations later, when robots possess the emotions to fall in love, he envisions marriage to his former employer's great-granddaughter (Embeth Davidtz). Free to employ all of Mr. Williams's moist, sad-clown expressions, Chris Columbus's film ''pours on the sentimentality in lumpy mawkish speeches about freedom, the joys of sex and the meaning of life'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>1999. Touchstone. $104.16; DVD, $32.99. 131 minutes. Closed captioned. PG. Release date: June 13.</p>
        <p>The Third Miracle</p>
        <p>The Rev. Frank Shore (Ed Harris), a Chicago priest suffering a crisis of faith, is assigned to look into the mystical phenomena associated with Helen O'Regan (Barbara Sukowa), an immigrant woman who is being considered for canonization. Delving into her life, Father Shore develops a strong attraction for her daughter, Roxanna (Anne Heche). Strong with this story element and avoiding the flashy telekinetic mayhem typical of the religious genre, Agnieszka Holland's film nevertheless ''becomes bogged down in fussy theological arguments'' (Holden).</p>
        <p>1999. Columbia Tri-Star. $99.36; DVD, $29.95. 119 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: June 13.</p>
        <p>Play It to the Bone</p>
        <p>Two burned-out middleweights, Vince (Woody Harrelson) and Cesar (Antonio Banderas), sign to fight a 10-rounder in Las Vegas. Needing transportation, they are driven across the desert by Grace (Lolita Davidovich), who was Vince's lover and is about to break up with Cesar. Both fighters have blown big chances and their case histories are hashed over during the trip. Their fight, a slugfest with flashbacks and hallucinations, resolves little in a film that ''ends up stranded in seriocomic limbo'' (Holden).</p>
        <p>1999. Touchstone. $104.16; DVD, $32.99. 124 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: June 13.</p>
