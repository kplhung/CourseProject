        <p>Japan's late prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, was remembered today in a solemn state service marked by emotional eulogies, cannonades, a parading honor guard in crisp white uniforms, and thousands of dark-suited mourners, including President Clinton.</p>
        <p>The service for Mr. Obuchi, who died on May 14, six weeks after having suffered a stroke, began under a hot and brilliant sky with a long slow procession into the large hall. The ceremony was held by Mr. Obuchi's wife, Chizuko, and their 28-year-old son, Takeshi, who bore a white box containing his father's ashes.</p>
        <p>With members of the imperial family and dignitaries from 170 countries in the hall, where a huge portrait of Mr. Obuchi hung against an illuminated powder blue background, his successor, Yoshiro Mori, remembered his friend and ally.</p>
        <p>''I am anguished to think how deeply disappointed Mr. Obuchi must have been to have had to retire from the arena of action, felled by an unforeseen illness,'' Mr. Mori said. ''In this moment of bereavement, I can do no more than express my heartfelt gratitude to former Prime Minister Obuchi for dedicating his all to this nation.''</p>
        <p>For all of the sobriety of the occasion, what was occurring offstage both before and after the ceremony was a burst of political activity and diplomacy of great significance for Japan's immediate future, and for the future of this region.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mori, for one, finally had a setting in which he could enjoy the statesman's attributes of his office. And with elections scheduled for June 25, Mr. Mori's huddles with Mr. Clinton, President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and senior Chinese and Russian officials provided welcome relief from the cycle of provocative blunders and tortured semiretractions that have cut deeply into the prime minister's popularity ratings.</p>
        <p>Eager for a lift, Mr. Mori's aides made much of the meetings with Mr. Clinton; Mr. Kim; the leaders of Australia, Indonesia and Thailand; and high-ranking officials from other countries. In all, Mr. Mori and Foreign Minister Yohei Kono had talks with 33 countries in two days.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Clinton had met Mr. Mori and Mr. Kim, his aides praised Seoul for taking the initiative in engaging its northern neighbor and hinted strongly at a relaxation of American economic sanctions against Pyongyang, many of which have been in place since the end of the Korean War. ''I would expect we would have an announcement on that very soon,'' a spokesman for the White House, P. J. Crowley, said.</p>
        <p>The administration had often expressed frustration with Mr. Obuchi and his government over the slow pace of reform to lift Japan out of its decadelong slump. But on this occasion, Mr. Clinton offered praise, saying history would regard Mr. Obuchi as someone who ''rose to the challenge with courage and confidence.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton did hint at new frustrations with Japan. Foreign Ministry officials said the president had raised, among other issues, the question of high international telephone-connection fees imposed by the national carrier, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which Washington sees as an unfair barrier to competition.</p>
        <p>Western diplomats said Mr. Clinton's decision to attend the service --  flying a roundtrip total of 26 hours for an eight-hour stay -- and his strong praise for Mr. Obuchi should be seen in the context of the ''unusually strong alliance'' that links the two countries and the steady support that Japan has provided for American foreign policy.</p>
        <p>The timing of the service, three weeks after Mr. Obuchi's cremation, was itself mired in politics. It was widely reported that the service was held as close as decently possibly to the elections to guarantee a large ''sympathy vote'' and help the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Since the date was announced, a string of unusually blunt nationalist statements by Mr. Mori, whose description of Japan as a ''divine country with an emperor at its center'' evoked imperialist prewar propaganda, undermined support for the government in the polls. Now the election promises to be a referendum on Mr. Mori rather than a commemoration of Mr. Obuchi.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mori's time in office has been unusually troubled. Opposition leaders and editorialists have poked holes into the sometimes contradictory official explanations of how power was secretively passed from the stricken Mr. Obuchi to a brief caretaker prime minister and, finally, to Mr. Mori.</p>
