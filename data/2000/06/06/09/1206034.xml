        <p>The owners of a Brooklyn pet shop were being held yesterday by police, accused of multiple felony counts for running a training and breeding center for cockfighting roosters in the basement of their business, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The illicit cockfighting business was uncovered, officials said, after nine armed agents of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals raided Jerry's Pet Store at 71 Central Avenue in Bushwick on Wednesday. The agents said the shop's cellar held rows of chicken coops and a small padded room in which the roosters were trained to fight or placed to demonstrate their ferocity in combat before potential buyers.</p>
        <p>The agents also found a harem of hens for breeding with the roosters, as well as egg incubators and 65 hypodermic syringes, which they said were used to inject injured fighting cocks with penicillin. The syringes were seized, along with $23,326, 170 metal fighting spurs and dozens of miniature boxing gloves that the authorities said were fitted over the birds' talons for training bouts or sales demonstrations.</p>
        <p>Paul M. Romano, an agent of the A.S.P.C.A., said the owners of the shop, Jermias Nieves, 61, and his son, David, 36, were accused by criminal complaint of animal fighting and animal cruelty. Both charges are felonies and punishable by a maximum of four years in prison. Jermias Nieves was also accused of criminal possession of syringes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romano said the A.S.P.C.A., which employs agents with arrest powers, has been investigating the cockfighting trade this year and has seized over 200 fighting roosters.</p>
        <p>The Nieveses were being held yesterday at the 83rd Precinct in Brooklyn while agents conferred with prosecutors to prepare the case for arraignment.</p>
        <p>''These men were breeders, and they sold their birds to people in the cockfighting trade,'' Mr. Romano said. He said the fighting cocks were sold for $200 to $500 each and that the Nieveses had 93 of the birds on hand when the agents arrived with a search warrant.</p>
        <p>Last weekend, the Police Department's Vice Enforcement Division raided a neglected Bronx theater and charged nearly 200 men with participating in a cockfighting tournament. The police were not involved in the raid on Wednesday, although they did hold the men while they awaited court appearances, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>All of the roosters found Wednesday were seized by the A.S.P.C.A. and killed by lethal injection. Mr. Romano said the hens were spared and left at the shop.</p>
