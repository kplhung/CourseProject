        <p>A Canadian software maker, the Corel Corporation of Ottawa, plans to eliminate 320 jobs, or 21 percent of its work force, as part of its survival strategy after the collapse last month of a proposed merger with the Inprise/Borland Corporation. Corel, which has been losing money and had staked its future on the Linux operating system, had hoped to tap $240 million from Inprise, which is based in Scotts Valley Calif., to avoid running out of cash. After the merger was scrapped, the company got a $15 million equity infusion from a Canadian investment dealer, the Canaccord Capital Corporation, and said it would cut operating costs by $40 million a year.</p>
