        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman moved today to settle a squabble between the Assembly and the Senate over school construction financing by agreeing to compose a compromise bill.</p>
        <p>Under a plan worked out today by  Mrs. Whitman and the leaders of the two chambers, the Senate would pass a bill the Assembly approved on Monday. The governor would then use her power of conditional veto to revise the bill to both leaders' satisfaction. The measure would then be approved by a vote in each house.</p>
        <p>The Senate was tentatively set to vote today on the Assembly's bill, but Donald DiFrancesco, the Senate president, postponed the vote so he could see the governor's version.</p>
        <p>''Don believes that it would not be productive to vote on a bill first and then engage in a game of Ping-Pong with the General Assembly,'' said Rae Hutton, Mr. DiFrancesco's spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>The state courts have ordered Trenton to come up with a $12 billion spending plan to rebuild school facilities in the state's poorest districts, known as the Abbott districts after the equal-opportunity lawsuit that established the state's responsibility for them.</p>
        <p>Although the Senate passed its version in January, the Assembly speaker, Jack Collins, objected to the Senate's committing the state to pay 100 percent of construction costs in the poor districts. He asked the State Supreme Court to clarify its ruling, and last month the court affirmed the state's obligation to pay all of the costs.</p>
        <p>After several hours of heated debate, the Assembly passed a version of the bill on Monday that committed the state to full payment but put a limit on how much the state could borrow to meet the court-ordered expenditures. Mr. Collins also inserted language giving the Legislature oversight over each school project, which the Abbott districts feared would needlessly delay the projects.</p>
        <p>Neither of these provisions is in the Senate version. The Senate bill, in turn, includes a measure dear to Mr. DiFrancesco's heart that would tie the new construction to a broader effort at community renewal around the selected schools.</p>
        <p>If Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Collins agree to the compromise Mrs. Whitman is devising, Mr. DiFrancesco will allow the Assembly version to pass the Senate, setting the stage for the governor's bill to be approved by both chambers before the Legislature's adjournment on June 30.</p>
