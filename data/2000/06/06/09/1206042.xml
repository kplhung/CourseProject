        <p>Al Leiter ducked beneath the streets to the subway station at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue last Tuesday, his two young daughters clutching each hand. The girls were going to watch their father do a television interview inside a subway car to promote the series between the Mets and the Yankees and then be treated to pizza.</p>
        <p>Leiter waited on the platform for the subway to arrive so he could do the interview and determined whether he would let his 4-year-old and 5-year-old girls have Italian ices after the slices. The subway barreled in, the doors opened and one Met and two girls sauntered through.</p>
        <p>It took a minute for someone to realize who Leiter was, a minute for one burly guy to notice the energetic pitcher from the Mets. The man did not want an autograph. He simply wanted to deliver a stern message, from one Yankee fan in a city of millions to the enemy for 365 days a year.</p>
        <p>''Hey, Leiter, you're going down,'' the straphanger screamed. ''Roger Clemens is going to get you. The Yankees are going to beat you.''</p>
        <p>The subway screeched into the next stop, which is when Leiter noticed he was on the No. 4 train. That line transports fans from Manhattan to 161st Street and Yankee Stadium, where Leiter and Clemens will be the starters in the battle of New York baseball tonight.</p>
        <p>Leiter, who resides in Manhattan, will not ride the No. 4 train to get to the Stadium tonight.</p>
        <p>''I guess I should have been on the 7 train that day,'' Leiter lamented.</p>
        <p>Leiter was smiling. He knows what it is like to cheer for the Mets when the Yankees are the elite team, knows what it is like to play for the Yankees when the Mets are the elite team and vice versa.</p>
        <p>He loved the Mets as a kid in the late 1970's, but the Yankees won two straight World Series in 1977-78. He made his debut with the Yankees in 1987 when the Mets dominated. Now Leiter is with the Mets and the Yankees have won three of the last four World Series titles.</p>
        <p>Basically, Leiter is the perfect person to put these monumental games into perspective. Not just because Leiter is starting against a future Hall of Famer who is not nearly as much of a New Yorker, but because he has lived both sides of the rivalry.</p>
        <p>Alex Leiter, Al's father, loved underdogs, so the merchant marine rooted for the Mets after they were born in 1962. Al, who was born three years later, followed his father's allegiance. Leiter was stronger than his friends in Pine Beach, N.J. so he used to sit on the Yankee fans, playfully torturing them like a 12-year-old bully until they admitted that the Mets were superior.</p>
        <p>Now Leiter uses his valuable left arm to win these arguments, an arm that has helped him win 36 games for the Mets since 1998 and helped him beat Clemens and the Yankees twice last year. Leiter has been the better pitcher in New York and the better pitcher this season, even if Clemens finally has a ring and that gritty loss to Pedro Martinez. There are more questions about Clemens in the Bronx than there have ever been about Leiter in Flushing and that is not likely to change.</p>
        <p>Now the two pitchers who both wear No. 22 and both have Randy and Alan Hendricks as agents meet on the same stage. Leiter recalled how he beat Clemens and the Yankees, 7-2, on June 6, 1999 to break an eight-game losing streak and begin a drastic turnaround for a dysfunctional team that had just seen three of its coaches jettisoned. Clemens's memories were murkier.</p>
        <p>''Did I pitch against them at Shea?'' Clemens asked reporters.</p>
        <p>Leiter spoke about the excitement of knowing that there is a thick line that divides Mets and Yankees fans before sheepishly adding: ''We play a lot of games. It can get boring. Why not spice it up?''</p>
        <p>Alan Hendricks, feeling as if he has suddenly been thrust into an episode of ''Arliss,'' said, ''I'll be pulling for No. 22.''</p>
        <p>The best memory Leiter has of Yankee Stadium is his first memory. He was only 21 when he debuted against the Milwaukee Brewers on Sept. 15, 1987 and struck out the first six batters, gave up one hit in six innings and won, 4-3.</p>
        <p>The Yankees played the Red Sox a few weeks later and a photographer asked Clemens, who was about to claim his second of five Cy Young Awards, to pose with Leiter, who was being touted as the next great fastball pitcher. Leiter, a tense rookie, scampered to the third-base dugout to meet Clemens. They said hello and not much else. He still has the picture. ''I should have him autograph it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Leiter is quick and witty with teammates, reporters and fans. But he was subdued with the heckler, the fan who predicted that Clemens was going to thrash Leiter tonight.</p>
        <p>''I told him that he was absolutely right,'' Leiter said. ''What was I going to do? Fight him? Tell him Roger was going down? I wasn't going to do that. Not there.'' Not there, not then, but maybe tonight.</p>
