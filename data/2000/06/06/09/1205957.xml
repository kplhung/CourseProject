        <p>The family of Patrick M. Dorismond said yesterday that they were ''weary'' of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's recent public condolences and complained that neither the mayor nor anyone on his staff had personally reached out to them since Mr. Dorismond was killed by the police in March.</p>
        <p>The family also insisted that they would not meet with Mr. Giuliani unless their lawyer, Johnnie Cochran, and the Rev. Al Sharpton were present.</p>
        <p>''We are dismayed that suddenly there is a change of climate in the mayor's handling of this case,'' Marie Andre Dorismond, Mr. Dorismond's sister, said in a statement yesterday. ''It has been almost three months since Patrick died, and we are weary of condolences coming from him at this juncture because we are still hurt by his initial reaction to our loss.''</p>
        <p>The family's statement came in response to comments that Mr. Giuliani made on Tuesday, when he said that he had tried to meet twice with the family in recent weeks to belatedly express sympathy. In the first days after the shooting of Mr. Dorismond, an unarmed black man, Mr. Giuliani released his juvenile arrest record and excoriated him as not having been an ''altar boy.''</p>
        <p>It took two months for Mr. Giuliani to say, on the eve of abandoning his Senate campaign, that he should have expressed sympathy to the family. Since then the mayor has tried to reach out to the Dorismonds through an intermediary, Father Brian Jordan. But the mayor has said that he will not meet with the family if a lawyer is present.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani had little comment yesterday on the family's statement. ''I don't want to get into that,'' he said at a news conference on Staten Island. ''There were a lot of difficulties that took place in the arrangements we tried to make and I don't know what kind of quicksand we're getting into here. We tried in good faith to organize a meeting with them.'' He added that he tried to arrange the meeting ''quietly and privately, because I don't want some kind of media event.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani objects to the presence of a lawyer at any meeting because the family has filed notice of a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the city, the mayor, the New York City Police Department and the officer who killed Mr. Dorismond.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Cochran said he was ''very mindful'' of the mayor's legal concerns and said that he had told the mayor's legal staff that the mayor should himself have a lawyer present if he wished. If a meeting with so many lawyers is unacceptable to the mayor, Mr. Cochran said, he would be willing to ''talk about'' having someone other than himself or Mr. Sharpton represent the family.</p>
        <p>''But I'm not going to tell the family what to do,'' Mr. Cochran said. He added that his clients ''are not going to go by themselves into a room with the mayor, at a time and place the mayor picks himself.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani also met for more than an hour at Gracie Mansion yesterday with C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, as part of a new relationship he promised with the city's minorities after he learned that he had prostate cancer. Ms. Fields, who has often sparred with the mayor, called the meeting a ''dialogue'' about a broad range of issues, and said she thought the mayor was particularly interested in community policing -- a method of crime fighting he has rejected in the past.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if he's changed,'' Ms. Fields said afterward. ''But I do think the meeting today was a very open discussion. I think he listened intently.'' The mayor, she said, promised that he would meet with her more often.</p>
