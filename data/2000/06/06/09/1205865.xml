        <p>John Powell sat before an electronic keyboard and a bank of computer screens and sound consoles in his basement office overlooking one of the palm-lined canals of Marina Del Rey.

        <p>Mr. Powell has composed music for action films (''Face/Off,'' 1997) and he has composed music for comedies (''Forces of Nature,'' 1999) and he has composed music for animated films (''Antz,'' 1998). But now he is putting the finishing touches on the score for a film that combines all three. ''Chicken Run'' is the debut feature film for Aardman Animation, the Oscar-winning stop-motion animation company behind the popular ''Wallace and Gromit'' series of shorts. It opens on June 21 in New York and Los Angeles and June 23 elsewhere. ''Basically,'' Mr. Powell said, ''It's 'The Great Escape,' but with chickens.''</p>

        <p>John Powell sat before an electronic keyboard and a bank of computer screens and sound consoles in his basement office overlooking one of the palm-lined canals of Marina Del Rey. A soft breeze ruffled the bougainvillea to the sound of rustling water. ''I know it looks like I'm on vacation,'' he said, ''but I'm actually working.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Powell has composed music for action films (''Face/Off,'' 1997) and he has composed music for comedies (''Forces of Nature,'' 1999) and he has composed music for animated films (''Antz,'' 1998). But now he is putting the finishing touches on the score for a film that combines all three. ''Chicken Run'' is the debut feature film for Aardman Animation, the Oscar-winning stop-motion animation company behind the popular ''Wallace and Gromit'' series of shorts. It opens on June 21 in New York and Los Angeles and June 23 elsewhere. ''Basically,'' Mr. Powell said, ''It's 'The Great Escape,' but with chickens.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Powell and his collaborator, Harry Gregson-Williams (who also worked on ''Antz''), have been trying to walk a fine line with the film's music. The movie is at one level a spoof of prisoner-of-war escape films but at another it takes its fowl characters very, very seriously -- tapping into the spit-in-their-eye cockiness of the soldiers in those movies.</p>
        <p>''It was very hard to find the tone,'' Mr. Powell said. ''The fact that it's chickens going over the fence instead of soldiers doesn't make any difference. I'm taking it as seriously as I possibly can.''</p>
        <p>To illustrate, Mr. Powell turned to his console and queued up the film's opening credit sequence. The heroine, a plucky hen named Ginger, has been caught making yet another escape attempt and tossed into solitary confinement. The angry farmer turns to a trio of hens watching fearfully from behind a wire fence. ''No one escapes from Tweedy's Farm,'' he growls. The camera pulls back from the hens' terrified faces to gradually take in the entire compound, a network of chicken huts surrounded by barbed wire that looks very much like a World War II prison camp.</p>
        <p>''You have certain conventions for this sort of music,'' Mr. Powell said. Beginning with the whistling P.O.W.'s in ''Bridge on the River Kwai'' and continuing with the Elmer Bernstein score for ''The Great Escape,'' there is always a juxtaposition between a somber military theme and a chirpy melody that is its counterpoint.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, as the camera pulls back over the opening credits, the music swells: a militarist fanfare that is gradually overtaken with a cheery melody meant to symbolize the unvanquished spirit of the imprisoned poultry.</p>
        <p>The composers began about three months ago, sitting at a keyboard and picking out a series of main tunes. Then they broke the movie into sections and divided the work. And finally, when they were finished with their rough drafts, they flew to England and did it with a live orchestra. ''That's basically how we do it,'' Mr. Powell said. ''We just sit here for a really, really long time.''</p>
        <p>'Shaft' Redux</p>
        <p>John Singleton knew there were certain things he had to have to make a new version of ''Shaft,'' the quintessential black action movie of the 1970's.</p>
        <p>''I knew going in that there were some essential elements that I needed,'' said Mr. Singleton, 32, the director of ''Boyz N the Hood'' (1991) and  ''Rosewood'' (1997), among other films. ''I needed a cool actor who could talk a lot of trash and people would love, and I got that with Samuel L. Jackson. And I knew I had to have Isaac Hayes's strong theme music. And I had to have the sly leather coat and the clothes, and Giorgio Armani took care of that.''</p>
        <p>It has been 28 years since Richard Roundtree (who has a small role in this new film) first appeared as the black private eye who knows how to outsmart both the crooks and the cops. This time around, Mr. Jackson plays the original character's nephew, a New York police officer, but he still finds himself between drug-dealing uptown crooks and justice-corrupting downtown big shots. There are differences between the urban world that Mr. Roundtree found in 1971 and the one Mr. Jackson finds today but there are also a lot of similarities. ''Basically they are pretty much the same,'' Mr. Singleton said.</p>
        <p>''Shaft'' opens on June 16.</p>
        <p>For his next project, ''Baby Boy,'' an independent film that he begins shooting this summer, Mr. Singleton said he planned to return to South Central L.A. and the problems he chronicled in ''Boyz N the Hood.'' It will be a followup to that film, he said, but not a sequel. The characters, for instance, will all be different.</p>
        <p>''But it will all take place in the same neighborhood, where I can show how things have changed and how they haven't,'' he said. ''My goal is to make the most ghetto movie ever made. I want it to have so much soul that it just jumps off the screen and grabs you.''</p>
        <p>Icing the Star</p>
        <p>David T. Friendly, producer of ''Big Momma's House,'' in which Martin Lawrence plays an F.B.I. agent who goes undercover as a corpulent Southern granny, said the filmmakers were concerned about how hard they would could push their star in the stifling heat. Just as the film was in preproduction, Mr. Lawrence suffered a debilitating case of heat stroke after jogging in a sweat suit near his San Fernando Valley home. He had only barely recovered when shooting began.</p>
        <p>''Here's a guy who suffered extreme heat stroke and had this incredible recovery -- miraculous is not too strong a word -- and he chose to take on this movie where he was going to be in a 50-pound fat suit and go through three hours of makeup each morning,'' Mr. Friendly said. ''He could have chosen to make a movie where a couple of people were talking in a room for most of the movie.''</p>
        <p>And it was quite warm on some of the movie's sets, he added. ''Big Momma's House'' opened on June 2 in a surprisingly strong debut, earning more than $25 million in its first weekend and almost toppling ''M:I-2'' from the top of the box-office charts.</p>
        <p>''We set up this cooling tent for him where he could go between shots,'' he said. ''It had fresh air blown into it from four different places. And on really hot days, he wore this apparatus that had ice water running through plastic tubes inside the fat suit. It was really brave of him to do this movie right after what happened to him.''</p>
