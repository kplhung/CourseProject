        <p>Lawrence Rubin Greenberg, Van Doren</p>
        <p>730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street</p>
        <p>Through tomorrow</p>
        <p>In her first solo exhibition, Malerie Marder catalogs many of the latest tics of contemporary photography. Her images are large and in color. They depict family and friends, often nude and usually staring blankly into space. They show people in intimate circumstances, but seem staged -- the opposite of the snapshot. Routine suburban dysfunction is once again the primary subject.</p>
        <p>Life is not fun in these images. Its low points and desolate interludes lengthen into eternities before Ms. Marder's lens. Nakedness is sometimes a metaphor for vulnerability and fragility, sometimes a shield, symbolic of alienation or unbreachable distances.</p>

        <p>Lawrence Rubin Greenberg, Van Doren</p>
        <p>730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street</p>
        <p>Through tomorrow</p>
        <p>In her first solo exhibition, Malerie Marder catalogs many of the latest tics of contemporary photography. Her images are large and in color. They depict family and friends, often nude and usually staring blankly into space. They show people in intimate circumstances, but seem staged -- the opposite of the snapshot. Routine suburban dysfunction is once again the primary subject.</p>
        <p>Life is not fun in these images. Its low points and desolate interludes lengthen into eternities before Ms. Marder's lens. Nakedness is sometimes a metaphor for vulnerability and fragility, sometimes a shield, symbolic of alienation or unbreachable distances.</p>
        <p>Some of these distances concern taboos, as in images of the artist's mother and brother in which one or the other is naked. In other cases they seem endemic to being photographed, which may be even less fun than life. Seated naked on his bathrobe on the living room carpet, an older man who one assumes is the artist's father looks truculently into the camera.</p>
        <p>In the best photograph, the artist and her sister kneel, naked, facing each other on a carpeted floor with nothing in sight but a dark paneled wall. Their contrasting looks (blond, brunette) and expressions (open, calculating) suggest an old-fashioned allegorical portrait, yet their nakedness and touching knees convey intimacy and recall childhood closeness. And the symmetry and plainness of their pose has a formal crispness that points up the lax, unvarying arrangement of the other images. This image is dimensional and layered. It implies that the improvement required of the other work here is within Ms. Marder's reach.</p>
