        <p>In an unexpectedly aggressive attempt to help insulate Europe against inflation, the European Central Bank tightened its grip on monetary policy today by raising its core interest rate half a percentage point.</p>
        <p>The move, pushing the baseline rate from 3.75 to 4.25 percent, surprised most economists and sent currency traders into a confused frenzy over the euro, Europe's common currency.</p>
        <p>The euro, which has enjoyed a remarkable turnaround in the last two weeks, initially climbed against the dollar, going from 96 cents to more than 97 cents. But then it slipped back to 95.7 cents.</p>
        <p>Higher interest rates tend to strengthen a currency. The euro's rise and subsequent fall today, foreign-exchange traders said, may have been caused by Wim Duisenberg, the central bank's president, who implied that there would not be any more rate increases soon.</p>
        <p>Before today, most currency experts and economists had predicted that the European Central Bank would increase rates by only a quarter of a point.</p>
        <p>Today's move came against the backdrop of the euro's travails in world currency markets. Since its introduction in January 1999, the euro has steadily plunged in value relative to the American dollar, from a high of $1.17 to a low of 88.5 cents last month.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, the euro suddenly began its first sustained recovery. Fueled largely by speculation that the central bank would intervene directly in currency markets -- speculation encouraged by veiled threats from central bankers -- the euro has climbed 10 percent to about 96 cents.</p>
        <p>In explaining the bank's decision today, Mr. Duisenberg insisted that the bank was not trying to meddle with exchange rates. Rather, he based the decision on Europe's accelerating growth and a heightened threat of inflation.</p>
        <p>''The outlook for growth in the euro area has improved markedly over the past few months,'' Mr. Duisenberg said at a news conference here today. But, he said, the risks of inflation had increased as a result of rising import prices -- for oil in particular.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Duisenberg said he remained unsatisfied with what he called the low value of the euro and acknowledged that this played an important if indirect role in today's decision.</p>
        <p>That is because the euro's decline has inevitably led to an increase in the prices of imports. The euro has slumped against the yen and the British pound as well as against the dollar, so Europe's imports from most of the world have been affected.</p>
        <p>''The reversal which started about two weeks ago still leaves, I believe, some potential for further appreciation,'' Mr. Duisenberg said. ''I know that the exchange rate of the euro -- even after the recent appreciation -- does not yet reflect fundamentals, whatever they may be.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Duisenberg also dampened expectations about additional rate increases later in the year. ''One of the motives to raise the rate by a half-point is that such a move will clear the horizon for some time to come,'' he told reporters. ''We think this move has cleared the horizon.''</p>
        <p>Tony Norfield, global currency analyst at the Dutch bank ABN Amro, said those remarks might explain why the euro declined after having initially risen.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Norfield predicted that the euro had already ''peaked'' and is likely to slip again.</p>
        <p>''It did look fairly aggressive at first,'' Mr. Norfield said. ''The thing that probably took the steam out of the euro was when Duisenberg suggested that was it and there wouldn't be any more.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Duisenberg was deliberately ambiguous and left himself ample maneuvering room for a shift in emphasis. But his implied message contrasted sharply with that of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who issued a clear warning about additional rate increases after the Fed raised rates on May 16.</p>
        <p>Though surprised by today's move, most economists said it was justified and came merely faster than they had expected.</p>
        <p>''It won't do much to damage growth,'' said Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist at Warburg Dillon Read in Frankfurt. ''I'd say the E.C.B. was a bit slow before and that this step compensates for that.''</p>
        <p>Stefan Schneider, head of euro-zone economic research at Deutsche Bank Research, said that Mr. Duisenberg was probably not reacting to the euro's weakness but that today's action could nonetheless keep the currency moving upward.</p>
        <p>''The E.C.B. won't dislike the windfall effect of the euro,'' Mr. Schneider said. ''In that respect, the timing is better than as if the hike had come a few weeks ago. The chances are always better if you support a market trend that has already crystallized.''</p>
