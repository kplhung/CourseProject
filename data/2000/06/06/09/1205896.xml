        <p>I want to take this opportunity to apologize to the state of Rhode Island for making fun of its Mr. Potato Head campaign.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year the Rhode Island Tourism Division scattered large, gaily decorated statues of Mr. Potato Head hither and yon in an effort to publicize its new marketing program for ''Rhode Island -- Birthplace of Fun.'' I was not as supportive of this venture as I might have been.</p>
        <p>But little did I know that my very own city was preparing a similar effort involving large, gaily decorated statues of cows. By next week at this time, New York is going to have more than 500 of them in the parks, on the traffic islands, wherever. We'll be seeing even more of the cows than of Rick Lazio. (As Republican Senate candidate, Mr. Lazio, in a spasm of overenthusiasm, promised to one-up Hillary Rodham Clinton's sweep through all 62 counties by visiting every single block in the state.)</p>
        <p>Animal statues are the new urban rage. Even as we speak, Cincinnati is being decorated with pigs. ''There are lizards in Orlando, moose in Toronto, horses in Lexington and fish in New Orleans,'' said Owen Findsen, the visual arts critic for The Cincinnati Enquirer. Cincinnati has recently begun to re-embrace its 19th-century nickname of ''Porkopolis,'' and Mr. Findsen, in a telephone interview, said he had just heard about a near-riot of enthusiastic citizens pressing to see the new all-pig fountain downtown.</p>
        <p>''Be careful if you talk to Lexington,'' he warned. ''They're very serious about the horses. They don't want anybody to poke fun.''</p>
        <p>Grand Rapids, Mich., is reported to be encouraging civic pride and tourism with huge painted rabbits. Miami has flamingoes. Lynnwood, Wash., is laying claim to the decorative chicken franchise. While New York is having its cow experience, West Orange, N.J., and Stamford, Conn., will be staging similar events. ''West Orange has one cow done by the guy who plays Furio in 'The Sopranos'; wait till you see his work,'' gushed Jerome Elbaum, the organizer.</p>
        <p>(We pause here to note that currently in the metropolitan New York region, no public event is regarded as truly successful unless at least one member of the ''Sopranos'' cast participates.)</p>
        <p>Last year Chicago set up 300 fiberglass cows painted by local artists, and the results were remarkable. ''The officially named Cows on Parade has been covered by everyone from The Jakarta Post to The Wisconsin State Farmer, brought more publicity to Chicago than the 1996 Democratic National Convention and generated up to $200 million in tourist dollars,'' said the rather envious Kansas City Star, in a report about plans to get Kansas City on the cow bandwagon. (''It shows spunk and confidence. We could use both,'' exhorted a local museum director.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Elbaum is president of one of several enterprises now competing for the business of filling up American cities with gaily decorated bovines. Truly this is a remarkable era -- we now enjoy an economy so expansive it can accommodate two Microsofts and four different cow parade companies. ''It's a wonderful opportunity for people who do not frequent art museums to see all these wonderful expressions of pure art,'' he said. ''I mean, you will see cows that look like the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.''</p>
        <p>Several questions come to mind here, one of them being how many additional tourists are going to come to New York City when they hear it has cow statues. Another is why a city that could never figure out how to privatize garbage collection has decided to put its public art in the hands of a profit-making venture based in Hartford.</p>
        <p>The New York cows, which were decorated by local artists and schoolchildren, include several really imaginative numbers -- there's one cow with a desk coming out of its side that I would be proud to call my own. But as a group, they're actually a little off-putting. It may be the statues' expressions, which are somewhere between blank and surly -- cow-like, if you will.</p>
        <p>And of course the whole thing has nothing whatsoever to do with New York City. Say what you will about Mr. Potato Head -- and I will personally never say another word again -- he was definitely born in Rhode Island. If New York City had wanted animal art, we should have painted pigeons.</p>
