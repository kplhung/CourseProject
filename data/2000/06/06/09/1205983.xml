        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Rescue Me, Please!'', by Maureen Dowd (column, June 7):</p>
        <p>I hope this is not really what women in the year 2000 are thinking. How can a 23-year-old woman already be sick of the daily grind? She has not even given her new life a chance.</p>
        <p>Women can still wear feminine clothes and don matching purses, but that does not mean that they have to give up their careers.</p>
        <p>I hope these women in their 20's and 30's never get a divorce, have the misfortune of having their husband die, or go bankrupt, because they are in for a rude awakening.</p>
        <p>Women are not going to get anywhere in life or in their careers with attitudes like this.</p>
        <p>LAURA GROSS  Washington, June 7, 2000</p>
