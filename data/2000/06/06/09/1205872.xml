        <p>Here is a selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>BARBARA BRUSSELL, Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 840-6800. This blond Los Angeles-born cabaret performer wields a 50's-style glamour-girl mystique that encompasses extremes of innocence and sophistication. Although her show, ''I Wish You Love,'' has some witty changes of pace, it is mostly a ballad-oriented program that features a tribute to Lerner and Loewe and builds to a sentimental peak with Stephen Sondheim's ''No More,'' from the musical ''Into the Woods.'' Ms. Brussell has a small cottony voice, which she pushes to its limit and sometimes beyond, at which times her inspirational impulse begins to cloy. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30. Cover: $50, with $50 prix fixe dinner required for early shows Saturdays and Sundays; $15 food or drink minimum for late shows; suggested dinner arrival for early show is 7. On Tuesday, Buddy Greco opens.</p>

        <p>BARBARA BRUSSELL, Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 840-6800. This blond Los Angeles-born cabaret performer wields a 50's-style glamour-girl mystique that encompasses extremes of innocence and sophistication.

Cover: $50, with $50 prix fixe dinner required for early shows Saturdays and Sundays; $15 food or drink minimum for late shows; suggested dinner arrival for early show is 7. On Tuesday, Buddy Greco opens.</p>
        <p>BARBARA CARROLL, Bemelmans Bar, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. This agelessly chic red-haired pianist and singer seems to know every important popular song ever written and to be able to perform from memory in any key. Her elegant, lyrical pianism is a compendium of 20th-century jazz styles, from Count Basie to Erroll Garner to Bill Evans and beyond. And her clipped, understated vocals, which verge on speech-song, approach lyrics from a wry but warmhearted point of view. Through July 22. Tuesday through Saturday nights, beginning at 9:30. From 5:30 to 8, Michael Devine. No cover for early show; cover for late show: $15. No minimum; $5 cover at the bar.</p>
        <p>* ROSEMARY CLOONEY, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. In a striking change of pace from her usual shows, Ms. Clooney is singing a mostly bossa-nova program with a seven-piece band that features the singer and guitar virtuoso John Pizzarelli, who occasionally joins voices with her. Ms. Clooney's versions of even the dreamiest bossa-nova standards have the warm commonsensical foundation that informs all her singing (she takes the long view of romance), while Mr. Pizzarelli, sounding like a young Joao Gilberto, wallows happily in the wistful romantic moods. The contrast between the two is bracing and never less than thoroughly musical. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30. Cover: $60; dinner required, with seating beginning at 6. Also at Feinstein's, Monday, Eric Comstock; on Tuesday Vikki Carr begins a two-week engagement.</p>
        <p>* HOWARD FISHMAN QUARTET, Sardi's, 234 West 44th Street, (212) 221-8440. Powerful echoes of Stephane Grappelli and Bix Beiderbecke are among the influences rippling through the Howard Fishman Quartet's seamless swing. The group -- Mr. Fishman on guitar, banjo and vocals; Russell Farhang playing virtuosic Grappelli-style violin; Peter Ecklund on cornet; Andrew Hall on bass -- folds elements of vintage jazz, swing and early bluegrass into rhythmically animated, richly allusive jazz chamber music. Whether the music is Stephen Foster (a bubbly ''Old Folks at Home''), Gershwin (''Soon'') or Romberg (''When I Grow Too Old to Dream''), it is all translated into lilting, fine-tuned ensemble music that transcends time and idiom. Fridays at 10:30 p.m. No cover charge, but $15 minimum at tables.</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Blue Angel Theater, 323 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes, which focuses on what Mr. Comstock calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, a creamy baritone who echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock focuses on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Today, tomorrow, Monday and Thursday nights at 8; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m.; Wednesday at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50 and $55 (premium ringside seating, $75 and $80).</p>
        <p>* BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. Although his voice has its ups and downs, Mr. Short, now 75, still gives the best cabaret party in New York. For his 32nd spring season at the Cafe Carlyle, he is joined by a small, top-notch swing band, and he struts his bluesier pianism in the instrumental ''Moten Swing.'' Nobody puts a more vivacious spin on Cole Porter than Mr. Short, whose new show includes a boyishly wistful version of ''Why Shouldn't I?'' and the hilariously tongue-twisting, double-entendre-laden title song from ''Can-Can.'' Tuesday through Saturday nights at 8:45 and 10:45. Through June 24. Cover: $60 at tables, no minimum; $30 cover at the bar.</p>
        <p>* MICHAEL WINTHER, Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 362-2590. Mr. Winther, a tasteful folk-pop tenor with the range and discipline of a trained theater singer, offers a generous sampling of recent American theater music (some of it from works in progress) in a sophisticated post-Sondheim mode. Among the composers are Adam Guettel, Ricky Ian Gordon, Debra Barsha and Jenny Giering (who accompanies on piano). The musical styles range from formalized folk-pop to funny 80's pop parodies to lush neo-romantic ballads. The abundance of burgeoning talent offers reason for hope. Monday at 8 p.m. Also at the Triad, Natalie Carter, singer, tonight at 10. Cover: $10; 2 drink minimum. Cover: $12; two-drink minimum.</p>
        <p>ARCI'S PLACE, 450 Park Avenue South, at 30th Street, (212) 532-4370. Tom Postilio, singer, in ''This Time Around,'' directed by Thommie Walsh. Tonight at 8:30; tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11; Tuesday through Thursday at 9. Through June 24. Monday night at 8, Steven Lutvak, singer-songwriter. Cover: $25; $15 minimum.</p>
        <p>UPSTAIRS AT ROSE'S TURN, 55 Grove Street, West Village, (212) 366-5438. Tonight at 7, ''Something Funny's Going On,'' stand-up comedy; at 9, ''The Elephant Man: The Musical''; at 11, ''Candy Comedy,'' stand-up. Tomorrow night at 7, Tom Kraft, singer; at 11, ''Candy Comedy.'' Cover: $5 to $12; two-drink minimum. No credit cards.</p>
