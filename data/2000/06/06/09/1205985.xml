        <p>To suggest that women who want to stay at home are lazy and unambitious, as Maureen Dowd does (column, June 7), misses the real reason why some women want to be rescued.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To suggest that women who want to stay at home are lazy and unambitious, as Maureen Dowd does (column, June 7), misses the real reason why some women want to be rescued.</p>
        <p>Feminism has had time to gestate a new generation of women who are faced with the bizarre feeling that they will be failures if they dare to have a child before they make corporate vice president.</p>
        <p>The competing pressures of a biological clock and the incredible effort required to chart a course in today's changing workplace are overwhelming. And in a society that increasingly devalues the decision to stay at home, it's no wonder why some women are wearing their hearts on their sleeves.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dowd's description of life at home may apply to Park Avenue digs with nannies, but it sure doesn't describe the life of a real ''hausfrau.''</p>
