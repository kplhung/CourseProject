        <p>GORODY - Tony (Antal) Sr. Passed away peacefully on June 6, 2000 in his home in Houston, Texas. Born in Budapest, Hungary in 1916, Tony's versatile piano artistry brought joy to many people throughout the world. A child prodigy, he toured Europe as a classical concert pianist. Subsequently, having falling in love with jazz, he toured with the W. Martiny and T. Brunner orchestras and performed as a solo pianist in many of the most popular night clubs in Hungary and Switzerald. He was recently honored by being included in a musical CD ROM Tribute, compiled by the Hungarian Foundation for Jazz Education and Research, for his contributions to jazz history. From 1952 to 1960, Tony lived in Havana, Cuba. There, he appeared as a guest on numerous television and radio shows, and was the featured artist of his own popular dining club, the Mes Amis (My Friends). After immigrating to the United States in 1960, Tony's popularity rose through his solo engagements at the Windsor Hotel, Montreal, The Pierre, Summit, Carlisle, Sherry Netherlands, and Park Lane Hotel (New York City), and other night clubs such as Gogi's and the House of Hungary. Starting in 1973, he maintained a sixteen year engagement at the Blue Room in the Warwick Hotel, Houston, Texas. We thank him for all the special moments he helped us bring in our lives through his dedicated artistry.There will be a musical tribute in his honor at a memorial service to be held Saturday, June 10, 2000 at 10am, Earthman Hunters Creek Chapel, 8303 Katy Freeway, Houston, Texas. Phone, 713-465-8900.</p>
