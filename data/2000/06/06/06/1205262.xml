        <p>High above Midtown Manhattan, Vice President Al Gore said last night that Representative Charles B. Rangel was ''in the catbird seat.'' And the Harlem Democrat, grinning through his mustache, looked as if he was indeed in a position of power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rangel's possible future as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee has brought him many friends.</p>
        <p>Last night, first at a reception at the Supper Club and then over dinner on the 33rd floor of the Service Employees International Union on 42nd Street, they raised $3.7 million for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, in the hope that the Democrats will recapture the House in November, an event that would automatically promote Mr. Rangel to the chairmanship of the powerful tax-writing panel.</p>
        <p>The size of the cache came as a surprise to everyone. It was $1 million more than the committee had expected, and it was delivered in an envelope at the Supper Club by Dennis Rivera, president of the union local, to David Jones, the fund-raiser for Mr. Rangel.</p>
        <p>The evening, built around Mr. Rangel's 70th birthday, which is days away, yielded the largest take for House Democrats since, oh, mid-March, when they raised $7.3 million at an event in Washington.</p>
        <p>But tonight drew an all-star cast of Democrats, including Mr. Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton, former Mayor David N. Dinkins, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, chairman of fund-raising for the House Democrats, assorted members of Congress from New York and Andrew M. Cuomo, the housing secretary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore stood on a folding metal chair at the dinner and lavished praise on Mr. Rangel.</p>
        <p>''Charlie Rangel is the heart and the soul of the Democratic caucus,'' Mr. Gore said. ''He is the lion of Lenox Avenue. He is the man with the constant growl. He is the man responsible for the Rangel renaissance. He is part of all the budget policy, the health policy, Social Security, Medicare, education -- the Ways and Means Committee has it all. Let's make Charlie Rangel the next chairman!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, in his new mode of refraining from attacks on his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, made mention of only one Republican, Newt Gingrich, but otherwise only broadly referred to ''the other side,'' which, he warned, would lead the nation into ruin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo said later that Mr. Gore's previous ''negative message'' had been an effective and persuasive critique of the Republicans. ''But he's more appealing when he's on the positive,'' Mr. Cuomo said.</p>
        <p>A buoyant Mr. Rangel followed the vice president's lead, climbing up on a chair and assuring his listeners, ''When we have the majority, one thing is going to be abundantly clear -- that we are going to move the Congress and the nation forward, that we are not going to pick fights with Republicans.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, who appeared at the Supper Club, where Lionel Hampton led a dozen trumpets and saxophones in unending refrains of ''Happy Days Are Here Again,'' also hailed Mr. Rangel in unusually laudatory language.</p>
        <p>''Maybe earlier than many, I began to just do whatever Charlie told me to,'' she told the crowd. Alluding to the days when her Senate candidacy had seemed just an improbable rumor, she said: ''And so when people said, 'Well, you know, gee, are you going to run for the Senate in New York?' I said, 'Well, Charlie told me I should,' so here I am, and I'm very happy I am because I'm having the time of my life.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, like Mr. Gore, gave a nod to Mr. Kennedy and to his uncle, Robert F. Kennedy, who, both noted, was assassinated 32 years ago. Mrs. Clinton said she was honored to be seeking the same Senate seat that he once held, one that her supporters often invoke as having been won by a non-New Yorker.</p>
        <p>She also lauded Mr. Gore and her husband, the president, saying that the nation elected them in 1992 on faith but now had the ''evidence and results'' of a thriving economy and that that was a big reason to elect Mr. Gore president.</p>
        <p>At the dinner at the union headquarters, Mr. Gore spoke of the soaring economy but also cautioned, ''There are a lot of people who are not yet being carried along.''</p>
        <p>It was in a similarly populist spirit that he began his day, proposing in a speech in North Carolina to put nearly all services of the federal government on line so that citizens would not have to wait in line or at their mail boxes to do things like receive their Social Security benefits, apply for a home loan with the federal government or report a crime.</p>
        <p>Numerous activities are now possible on line, like applying for student loans, making reservations at the national parks and paying taxes. Mr. Gore would expand those services, so that, for example, people could pay their taxes directly over the Internet without having to go through a software intermediary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's plan, which aides said would cost $100 million but would quickly pay for itself by cutting paperwork and saving time, would be accomplished by 2003.</p>
