        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman proposed new state water and sewer management rules yesterday aimed at protecting and improving the cleanliness of New Jersey's watersheds and drinking water.</p>
        <p>The governor said the rules would also encourage ''smart growth'' by allowing development in areas already designated for sewer service and by requiring ''comprehensive environmental analyses'' for development outside those areas.</p>
        <p>The rules, however, were immediately assailed by environmental advocates, who said that much of the estimated 350,000 acres where sewer service has been approved is actually ecologically sensitive, and that the new rules would make development there much easier.</p>
        <p>''To automatically grandfather in all that land -- about a quarter of the remaining undeveloped land in the state -- without any  kind of environmental review basically guts the rule,'' said Jeff Tittel, the director of the state chapter of the Sierra Club. ''It's almost meaningless.''</p>
        <p>The rules, which are expected to be made final in the fall after public comment is sought, are intended to be a major plank in the campaign the governor announced in 1998 to control sprawl and preserve a million acres of undeveloped land.</p>
        <p>Under the proposed rules, if a development is planned in an area that does not have sewers or approval for them, the developer would have to file a ''comprehensive environmental assessment'' of the project's effect on water quality and supply. Environmental assessments are now required only in some cases.</p>
        <p>It was not clear what ''comprehensive environmental assessment'' would entail because the proposed rules were not released in detail.</p>
        <p>Even within designated sewer areas, developments of six or more homes that use septic systems would also be subject to review under the rules.</p>
        <p>The rules would also require the State Department of Environmental Protection to work with local groups to develop plans for managing wastewater, watersheds and overall water quality across the state. They would also require formulating plans to restore waterways that do not meet state and federal clean-water standards.</p>
        <p>The governor said in a statement that even though the state had already spent $5 billion upgrading sewage plants, ''as development in nonsewered watershed occurs, water quality worsens due to increased sewage and runoff wastes in those areas. These rules serve to end that trend and look at ways to maintain clean water.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Tittel of the Sierra Club, which has been pressuring the state for years to tighten its water-quality rules, said that many of the rules were disconcertingly vague.</p>
        <p>''They put out a rule that all amendments to sewage plans have to go through strict standards that protect and clean up our polluted waterways, but right now we don't know what the standards are going to be,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He also complained that the rules require sewer plans to be consistent with broader watershed management plans, but that the watershed plans will not be drawn up for years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tittel reserved his harshest criticism for the rule that he said allows development without review in fragile areas that have nevertheless been approved for sewage hookups.</p>
        <p>As an example, he cited a 1,600-unit development called Powder Hollow that has been proposed in Wanaque, in Passaic County, near the Wanaque Reservoir. The site is in an area that is approved for sewers, but it is criscrossed by wetlands and trout streams, and environmental advocates have been trying to derail the proposed development.</p>
        <p>''We thought we might be able to stop the project through the permitting process for the sewer-plant expansion,'' he said. ''My concern is that now it might be grandfathered in, whereas before even though the rules were weak we could go after it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tittel also criticized the state for releasing the rules after 4 p.m. on the eve of an important election. ''That shows that they're trying to hide it,'' he said. ''They're not proud about putting this out.''</p>
        <p>A reporter's call last night to the governor's press secretary, Pete McDonough, seeking comment on the timing of the release of the rules, was not returned.</p>
