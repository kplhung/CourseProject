        <p>With American support, the World Bank is expected to approve on Tuesday a $3.5 billion project to develop an oil pipeline in Chad and Cameroon in West Africa, despite widespread concerns about the potential for corruption and environmental damage.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration will vote in favor of World Bank sponsorship after specifying an unusually detailed list of safeguards that officials hope will earmark the oil revenues for development projects and ward off abuse, a senior American official said today.</p>
        <p>Although the project does not have united European support, the United States, as the major shareholder in World Bank, is confident that there will be enough votes for a loan to pass, the official said. Exxon Mobil is the lead company that is seeking the loan. The World Bank is generally expected to contribute $90 million to $200 million.</p>
        <p>The proposed 663-mile pipeline, which would link oil fields in landlocked Chad to the Atlantic Coast of Cameroon, has stirred an outcry among environmentalists and antipoverty crusaders. They say the project will provide a boon to corrupt African officials, dislocate indigenous peoples and harm ecologically sensitive areas.</p>
        <p>The senior American official said critics had ''very legitimate concerns.'' But after more than two years working with the oil companies, officials and independent figures in both countries, he said, planners have come ''a very long way'' in addressing them.</p>
        <p>''This is a project with substantial development potential,'' the official said. ''I'm confident that it will be approved.''</p>
        <p>Environmental groups contend that the companies have failed to set aside adequate money to clean up an oil spill, allocating less than $1 million, despite Dutch researchers' citing a need for $28 million.</p>
        <p>The pipeline, the critics add, will threaten the livelihoods of hundreds of Bagueli people, or pygmies, and endanger the habitats of endangered black rhinos, gorillas and chimpanzees.</p>
        <p>''Any time you lay a pipeline, you're basically building a road for loggers and poachers,'' said Alejandro Queral, associate Washington representative of the Sierra Club.</p>
        <p>Other critics say the World Bank will effectively be lining the pockets of a corrupt government in Chad that the State Department says brutally persecutes its enemies. Nearly every region of Chad, a nation two and a half times the size of France, has erupted in ethnically based unrest.</p>
        <p>Providing oil revenues to the central government is ''like adding more fuel to the fire,'' asserted Korrina Horta, a senior economist at Environmental Defense in Washington.</p>
        <p>''It's a very dangerous situation,'' Ms. Horta added.</p>
        <p>Exxon Mobil has insisted on World Bank participation as a hedge against instability, Ms. Horta said. She referred to the bank's role, which represents less than 10 percent of the project, as ''political risk insurance'' for investors.</p>
        <p>''You make the World Bank a shareholder in the project, and no government is ever going to nationalize it,'' Ms. Horta said.</p>
        <p>In addition, the support clears the way for Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Petronas to seek additional financing before investing $3 billion of their own, she said, adding, ''It's the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.''</p>
        <p>In tandem with its support for the loan, the administration has insisted on a framework to be monitored by the World Bank that would reduce the risk of corruption or mismanagement. That structure would include an escrow account for oil revenues that would set aside most of the income for health, education and development and allow for monitoring by nongovernmental groups in Chad.</p>
        <p>The American-backed strictures also require that money be set aside to create national parks, compensate displaced people and respond to oil spills.</p>
        <p>The pipeline would be one of the largest that involves direct foreign investment in Africa in decades, officials said. Experts expect it to generate $80 million to $100 million a year for Chad and $20 million in transfer fees for Cameroon.</p>
        <p>American officials acknowledged that the project would be something of a test for the World Bank. Last week, the bank released a report in which it faulted itself and the International Monetary Fund for making Africa poorer through failed lending policies over 40 years.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 12, 2000, Monday  An article on Tuesday about the World Bank's consideration of an oil pipeline in Africa referred incorrectly to a recent report by the bank on African poverty. The study concluded that Africans were poorer than 40 years ago and that a share of the blame belonged to the bank and the International Monetary Fund. But the contention that the two organizations had made the continent poorer through failed lending policies came from recent Washington demonstrators, not from the study.</p>
