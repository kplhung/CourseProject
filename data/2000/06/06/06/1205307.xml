        <p>DULLEA-Jeff. 1946-2000. It is with deep sorrow that we announce the passing of Jeff Dullea on June 4 after a prolonged illness. Jeff was President of Penn South from 1994 through 1997 and for five years prior to that he was a member and Secretary of the Board of Directors. He created the internationally acclaimed Childrens Garden in 1984 and in 1998 it was renamed in his honor The Jeff Dullea Intergenerational Garden. Jeff was a Science teacher at the High School for the Humanities in Chelsea. He had a lifetime of dedication to the principals of the cooperative movement. Our sincerest condolences to his wife, Judith Eisenberg and his daughter Sarah and his family. A Memorial service will be announced shortly. The Board of Directors of Mutual Redevelopment Houses (Penn South) Robert Silverstein, Pres. and Brendan Keany, General Manager</p>
