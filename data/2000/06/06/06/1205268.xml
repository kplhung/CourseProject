        <p>Faced with a relief pitcher wild in two ways, the Atlanta Braves demoted John Rocker to the minor leagues and fined him $5,000 yesterday. If Rocker's stay at Richmond of the International League lasts four weeks, he will miss the Braves' eagerly awaited four-game series against the Mets at Shea Stadium at the end of this month.</p>
        <p>The Braves' action came a day after Rocker orally attacked a magazine reporter for the article that quoted Rocker as denigrating large segments of society. His comments in the Sports Illustrated interview earned Rocker a fine and suspension and have made him a controversial focus of fans and players alike.</p>
        <p>Rocker's teammates seemed to tolerate him, hoping he would maintain a low profile and not cause further disruption in their clubhouse. But his confrontation with the reporter Jeff Pearlman near the clubhouse in Atlanta on Sunday appeared to eradicate their patience.</p>
        <p>The Braves said they optioned Rocker to Richmond for his performance on the field.</p>
        <p>''As has been fairly evident watching him pitch, he has not been able to demonstrate the ability to command or control his stuff, and it has gotten him and our team in considerable hot water,'' General Manager John Schuerholz said by telephone from Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Schuerholz said he, Manager Bobby Cox and Leo Mazzone, the pitching coach, had been discussing the best way to try to get Rocker straightened out.</p>
        <p>''The environment to do that doesn't exist here,'' Schuerholz said. ''We don't have the luxury for guys to work their way through tough times. We decided he needs to pitch consistently to do that. We think he will do that and be as good as he was last year.''</p>
        <p>Rocker, who gained 38 saves last year, has been one of the most erratic relievers in the National League this season. He had 10 saves, but he also averaged 2.4 base runners per inning. He walked 25 and gave up 18 hits in 18 1/3 innings. Of the 41 N.L. pitchers who had walked 25 or more before last night's games, most had pitched far more innings than Rocker. The closest pitcher to him was Scott Sauerbeck, a Pittsburgh reliever, who had walked 31 in 29 1/3 innings.</p>
        <p>Schuerholz said the problem had reached the point where Cox ''had to have a shadow closer behind the closer.''</p>
        <p>''That wears on the bullpen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Rocker's wildness gave the Braves good cover for their move. They don't have to give a reason for optioning Rocker, but the players association could question whether it was a disciplinary action. Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, was traveling yesterday and couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Schuerholz readily acknowledged that the fine was a disciplinary measure for Rocker's tirade against Pearlman, who quoted the pitcher as telling him, ''Do you know what I can do to you?'' and ''This isn't over between us.''</p>
        <p>Commenting on the outburst, Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement that he was ''saddened by the regrettable incident.''</p>
        <p>''Major League Baseball is monitoring the situation closely, and I have been in contact with Braves President Stan Kasten throughout the day,'' he added. ''While Major League baseball is conducting its own investigation, I am satisfied that the Braves have moved expeditiously and have treated the matter with the seriousness it deserves.''</p>
        <p>Selig, acting on Rocker's magazine comments, initially fined Rocker $20,000 and suspended him for all of spring training and the first four weeks of the season. The union challenged the action, and an arbitrator reduced the fine to $500 and the suspension to the first two weeks of the season.</p>
        <p>An optioned player must remain in the minors for 10 days unless another player on the major league roster is injured. But a four-week stay would ease a problem -- his appearance at Shea for the first time since the N.L. Championship Series last October. The Braves play in New York June 29 and 30 and July 1 and 2.</p>
        <p>''I think the security issue becomes less of a concern if he is not with the team,'' Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said yesterday. ''I think we'll be prepared either way. It's something we always have to be aware of when a team like the Braves is in.''</p>
        <p>Phillips said he could understand why the Braves sent Rocker to the minors. ''It becomes a disruption,'' he said. ''You've read the players' comments, plus he hasn't been performing well.''</p>
        <p>To take Rocker's roster spot, the Braves promoted Jason Marquis, a pitcher, from Class AA Greenville.</p>
