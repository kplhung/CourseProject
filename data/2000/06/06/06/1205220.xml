        <p>On paper, at least, Christine B. Whitman looks like a slice of old Rochester. She grew up there, works at a company that was once part of Kodak, lives in a local landmark, and serves on the boards of all kinds of civic groups.</p>
        <p>But how many members of the old guard long for ''a nerd bird'' --  nonstop jet service from Rochester to Silicon Valley?</p>
        <p>And that is just one of the things that makes Chris Whitman a living symbol of the new, high-tech Rochester, many people here say. The company she runs, CVC, makes equipment for the computer industry. It sells these machines to Kodak and Xerox, yes, but also to I.B.M. and Sony and Seagate Technology.</p>
        <p>CVC not only sells its products around the world, but it also has offices across the country and overseas. Ms. Whitman spends much of her time on the road, and keeps an apartment in California near her Silicon Valley office.</p>
        <p>Why did she not move CVC out there, to where so many of her high-tech customers are? ''I considered that,'' she said. ''But my family is here, and we are committed to the Rochester area.'' Her husband, Steve, teaches advanced placement physics at Brighton High School; her son is in the eighth grade (and her daughter attends the University of Illinois).</p>
        <p>''Years ago, Rochester was fairly self-contained, probably not as global and diverse,'' she said. But as the economy has shifted to smaller, high-tech firms, she added, ''more of us are traveling through the world.''</p>
        <p>Getting potential employees to move to Rochester has been a challenge, Ms. Whitman concedes: ''People think this is pretty close to Alaska, not a little bit west of Boston.'' But she has succeeded in attracting employees by concentrating on people with families who would be attracted to Rochester's cultural and recreational amenities, she said, and the fact that it is ''a low-hassle place to live.''</p>
        <p>She has done things unimagined by most worker bees. After a dozen years at CVC, she raised money and bought out the previous owners in 1990 (the company was started as a division of Kodak in 1934).</p>
        <p>In 1999, she took the company public by selling stock through a big Wall Street firm, Lehman Brothers. CVC had gone from about 100 employees and $10 million of sales to 400 employees and $100 million of sales.</p>
        <p>And this year, she did a very un-Rochester thing -- she merged CVC with a company from Long Island, Veeco. She became president and chief operating officer of the merged company, and remains based in Rochester.</p>
        <p>Not everything has gone smoothly, of course. Veeco CVC has announced the layoff of 180 people, most of them at a plant in Virginia.</p>
        <p>In Rochester, ''generations of people lived, their children stayed, there wasn't much movement,'' Ms. Whitman said. That, she said, is no longer true.</p>
        <p>Does she expect her own children to stay in Rochester? ''I'd say,'' she replies after a pause, ''they're going to go where their careers take them.''</p>
