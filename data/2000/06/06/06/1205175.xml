        <p>John I. Millis, a former case officer with the Central Intelligence Agency who for the last three years served as the top staff member of the House Intelligence Committee, committed suicide on Sunday, the police and Congressional officials said today. He was 47 and lived in Vienna, Va.</p>
        <p>George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, described Mr. Millis as ''a tenacious advocate for a strong national intelligence capability.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Fairfax City police said officers were called to a motel about 8 p.m. on Sunday because a man was threatening suicide. Officer Jeff Morrison said that when the police arrived they found Mr. Millis dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound. The police said they were investigating the death.</p>
        <p>Before becoming a senior staff aide in Congress, Mr. Millis served as a case officer for the C.I.A. for nearly 13 years. In that period, he lived in Pakistan, working to provide covert aid to Afghan rebels who were fighting the Soviet army.</p>
        <p>In 1996 and 1997 he was staff director of a special Congressional committee that investigated the Clinton administration's approval of arms shipments from Iran to Muslim forces in Bosnia.</p>
        <p>He was named staff director of the House Intelligence Committee, the top staff position, in 1997.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, Linda.</p>
