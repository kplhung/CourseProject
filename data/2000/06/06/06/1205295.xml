        <p>The Giants cut linebacker Corey Widmer yesterday, to free money under the salary cap and to help the team become quicker -- even at a pivotal run-stopping position like middle linebacker.</p>
        <p>Widmer, a former defensive lineman who is 6 feet 3 inches and 255 pounds, was cast in the more traditional role of the punishing middle linebacker, where he was the starter since 1994. His replacement, Mike Barrow, a free agent signed this winter, weighs 240 pounds and is noted for his quickness and pass-rushing abilities.</p>
        <p>Widmer, 31, was noted for his fiery on-field demeanor and an analytical mind. He would often learn the assignments of all the defensive players and had played in 91 consecutive games until a back injury forced him to sit out a December game last season. He had off-season surgery on his back.</p>
        <p>''Corey has been a terrific Giant and a solid player here,'' General Manager Ernie Accorsi said.''His character will be missed as much as his playing ability.'' Releasing Widmer gives the Giants $1.8 million in salary-cap relief.</p>
