        <p>Eighteen months after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced plans to build a new trading complex for the New York Stock Exchange, the city has still not signed a formal agreement with the exchange for the heavily subsidized project, which includes a huge office tower in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Nor have city and state officials signed a deal to buy the land for the project, an entire block bounded by Wall Street, Exchange Place, Broad Street and William Street. Even so, the estimated size of the public subsidy has grown to $640 million from $560 million, not including the cost of the land.</p>
        <p>Despite the lengthy delays, the exchange says it is moving forward, and some public officials are optimistic that the deal to build the complex will ultimately fall into place.</p>
        <p>Behind the scenes, however, there is bickering and widespread doubt that the project is necessary, given the advent of electronic networks that could replace the need for traditional trading floors. Although more than 680 million shares a day are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, critics contend that investors in the United States are increasingly buying and selling over the Internet, while the major stock exchanges in London, Frankfurt and elsewhere have already converted to electronic trading.</p>
        <p>''There's a big question whether you need trading floors anymore,'' said Norman S. Poser, a former executive vice president of the American Stock Exchange and a professor of securities law at Brooklyn Law School. ''In Europe, you don't have any more trading floors. It's electronic; all the trading's done at your desk.''</p>
        <p>But Richard A. Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, has insisted that there will always be a need for the trading floors that have made it the world's premier exchange. Electronic communications networks such as Instinet and Island now account for about 30 percent of the transaction volume on the Nasdaq but have failed to make much of a dent at the exchange, where institutional investors still prefer to trade. Mr. Grasso has said the exchange needs a new complex to grow beyond its cramped historic headquarters on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>''We continue to work with the city and the state to move the project forward as expeditiously as possible,'' said Ray Pellecchia, a spokesman for the Big Board. ''We have the same space needs we had earlier. Our plans haven't changed a bit.''</p>
        <p>Neither Deputy Mayor Robert R. Harding nor Michael Carey, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, returned calls requesting comment.</p>
        <p>City and state officials have completed a draft environmental impact statement for the project but have held off certifying the project for public review. Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said that he expected to submit the environmental statement for public review as soon as the exchange signed a letter of intent. ''Everyone is still working together,'' Mr. Gargano said. ''It has taken a very long time, but it's a very large project.''</p>
        <p>But according to several people involved in the negotiations, some public officials contend that the stock exchange has dragged its feet over signing a letter of intent with the city, possibly because of its own uncertainty. The letter was supposed to be signed over a year ago. Exchange executives have played down the importance of the document, countering that they would sign a binding lease for the trading complex if only the city would complete a deal to buy the land for the project.</p>
        <p>The land deal is another thicket of recriminations. The city has been negotiating with J.P. Morgan, which controls four of the five buildings on the proposed site, and the Rockrose Development Corporation, which owns the fifth, an apartment house. Yet, Morgan has stopped moving employees out of the buildings and Rockrose is still renting apartments.</p>
        <p>According to the officials involved in the negotiations, J.P. Morgan has grown tired of waiting for the city to complete its agreement with the exchange. The company wants the city to buy the land now or allow it to sell the property to a developer. The city, in turn, suspects that Morgan is trying to get a higher price for its property, according to the officials.</p>
        <p>City officials expect that it will cost about $350 million to acquire all the property and relocate tenants, but it is loath to do so without a definitive deal with the exchange. The city has said that the projected rent from the trading complex and the office tower should more than offset the cost of buying the land.</p>
        <p>The project has evolved since a mayoral news conference in December 1998. Mayor's Giuliani's offer to build a trading complex for the exchange came after Mr. Grasso threatened to move to New Jersey. The city did not want to risk losing the exchange and the possible dissolution of the financial district, although many real estate and financial executives doubted that the exchange would move.</p>
        <p>Unlike the city, the state has been more skeptical of threats by the exchange and has tried to limit the state's financial stake in the project. As a result, the city has committed $255 million toward the $480 million cost of the trading complex, while the state has declined to go above $225 million.</p>
        <p>In recent months, according to a copy of the draft environmental impact study obtained by The New York Times, the size of the trading complex has been cut 25 percent, to 600,000 square feet. The complex would contain a 50,000-square-foot trading floor, a smaller trading floor and administrative offices. The stock exchange has said it will spend $350 million to outfit the complex.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the office tower, which is to sit atop the trading complex, has grown to 1.3 million square feet from 1.2 million.</p>
        <p>Some critics said that the project was beginning to look more like a real estate deal than an effort to keep the stock exchange in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''It certainly raises the question of whether the city is providing incentives to keep the stock exchange, or to build another office tower,'' said Jonathan Bowles, research director of the Center for an Urban Future.</p>
