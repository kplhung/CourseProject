        <p>BLOCKBUSTER TV commercials. Glitzy news conferences. Celebrity endorsers. The Pepsi-Cola Company is practically synonymous with those kinds of big-league national marketing tactics.</p>
        <p>So it's somewhat odd that Pepsi's FruitWorks, a line of juice-based noncarbonated drinks that will compete with brands like the Triarc Beverage Group's Snapple and Coca-Cola's Fruitopia, is being introduced nationally this month with comparatively -- but deliberately -- little fanfare.</p>
        <p>Pepsi has decided the best way to ingratiate FruitWorks with the ever-fickle youth market is through grass-roots marketing programs that it hopes will create a word-of-mouth allure and a hip personality for the new brand. While grass-roots marketing has always been a part of selling brands at Pepsi, this time it is the marketing plan, said Robin Kaminsky, Pepsi's director of alternative beverages.</p>

        <p>BLOCKBUSTER TV commercials. Glitzy news conferences. Celebrity endorsers. The Pepsi-Cola Company is practically synonymous with those kinds of big-league national marketing tactics.</p>
        <p>So it's somewhat odd that Pepsi's FruitWorks, a line of juice-based noncarbonated drinks that will compete with brands like the Triarc Beverage Group's Snapple and Coca-Cola's Fruitopia, is being introduced nationally this month with comparatively -- but deliberately -- little fanfare.</p>
        <p>Pepsi has decided the best way to ingratiate FruitWorks with the ever-fickle youth market is through grass-roots marketing programs that it hopes will create a word-of-mouth allure and a hip personality for the new brand. While grass-roots marketing has always been a part of selling brands at Pepsi, this time it is the marketing plan, said Robin Kaminsky, Pepsi's director of alternative beverages.</p>
        <p>Pepsi is going this route after its vast research -- and this is the company that invented the ''Pepsi generation'' -- indicated that very specific promotions and TV commercials made especially for young people were the best ways to establish awareness of FruitWorks.</p>
        <p>''The best way to talk to our target is not through mass marketing, but through the kinds of one-on-one marketing that our plan is about: linking with our target and talking to them the way they want,'' Ms. Kaminsky said.</p>
        <p>The strategy to reach young people aged 15 to 24, but as young as 12, relies on an entertainment-oriented Web site, free samples and a national promotion starting in July on MTV's ''Total Request Live,'' a popular hit-music countdown show.</p>
        <p>Central to Pepsi's strategy of reaching computer-savvy kids is a new Web site, created by DDB Digital in New York, part of the DDB Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. Steven Marrs, DDB Digital's chief operating officer, said the agency knew from its experience as the creator and manager of pepsiworld.com that today's youth were almost hard-wired to reject direct pitches that dictate what is or is not cool.</p>
        <p>Instead, he said, the challenge was to offer a Web site where young people help to create ''the personality and tonality of the brand.''</p>
        <p>''What we've learned is that these kids are not like everyone else,'' Mr. Marrs said. ''They are not ones to be marketed to, and they have a desire to go out and create their own space in the world. So we work with them to build the brand, and give expression of who they are.''</p>
        <p>The FruitWorks site (www.fruitworks.com) features a ''music maker,'' where visitors can make their own dance tracks, and a place to create cartoons frame by frame, including word balloons. Both can be e-mailed to friends -- which is a way for Pepsi to spread the word about FruitWorks. The site went up  Feb. 8, and through May 22 had 102,000 different visitors, according to DDB Digital research.</p>
        <p>''In talking to this market, it's important to be cool, but you can't just say, 'We're cool,' '' said Steve Hicks, DDB Digital's creative director. ''We actually created a space where kids can go and express themselves.''</p>
        <p>The FruitWorks promotion with MTV is also an un-commercial. For example, two ads created by MTV and showing only on the music network focus on the Total Request Live fanatics who line up daily outside the windows of MTV's Times Square studios to get a glimpse of the celebrities who appear on the show. In the spots, a fan discovers FruitWorks for some much-needed refreshment. FruitWorks is also sponsoring the first release of the show on home video in July.</p>
        <p>''It made sense in a big way to tap into the zeitgeist of T.R.L., and not so literally be a commercial,'' said John Shea, MTV's senior vice president for strategic programming.</p>
        <p>That the ads were created by MTV's in-house commercial division is unusual. Big corporations typically assign an ad agency of record before a brand campaign is started. But Pepsi decided at the start to do this differently, and so far there hasn't been a need for a classic ad agency relationship, although the company still works with its longtime agency, BBDO Worldwide, on media planning and buying, Ms. Kaminsky said.</p>
        <p>She said Pepsi expects FruitWorks to be a top five brand in its first year, and that so far sales are 50 percent above company projections.</p>
        <p>FruitWorks, featuring flavors like strawberry melon and peach papaya, is coming late to the market, however. Fruit beverages in single-serve bottles had their fastest growth in the early 1990's with the proliferation of so-called new-age beverages, led by the phenomenal early success of Snapple's iced teas and fruit drinks, said Gary Hemphill, vice president for information services at the Beverage Marketing Corporation, a New York-based research concern. Coke also introduced Fruitopia in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>The market has since slowed, with sales growing last year about 7 percent, to $2.2 billion, Mr. Hemphill said. He said Snapple was still the leader, with 12.4 percent of the market, but that Fruitopia was growing fast and had 8.5 percent. By comparison, the carbonated beverage market's growth has been flat at $40 billion.</p>
        <p>Still, Pepsi's decision not to put big advertising dollars behind FruitWorks has not been lost on its competitors.</p>
        <p>''I think they are taking a low-key approach and it's just a product that some of their bottlers need to fill up some accounts to try to compete with new-age beverages,'' said Mike Weinstein, Triarc's chief executive.</p>
        <p>Snapple has become known for its grass-roots marketing and wacky ''Best stuff on earth'' advertising, first with Wendy the Snapple Lady as spokeswoman and more recently with national TV commercials that feature ''real'' fruits (actors costumed as bananas and peaches) to underscore that Snapple is all natural. That campaign, created by Deutsch, New York, shows Snapple fruits at a health spa where they get in shape with gym equipment and are randomly tested for preservatives.</p>
        <p>But with Pepsi's powerful distribution system, FruitWorks' potential cannot be underestimated. Mr. Hemphill said he believed Pepsi aimed to do in the juice-based category what it did in the single-serving iced-tea market. Snapple created that category back in the 1980's, but it was overtaken by Lipton several years ago. Lipton Iced Tea is marketed by the Pepsi-Lipton Tea partnership.</p>
        <p>''For Pepsi, it's really about their distribution system; that sets them apart from the competition,'' Mr. Hemphill said. ''I think this gives FruitWorks an excellent opportunity to be successful.''</p>
