        <p>As a nonpolitical observer in 1993, when the Oslo accords ushered in a new era in relations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, I thought that many Israelis had made up their minds about the accords based not on a careful review of their contents, but on assumptions.

        <p>As a nonpolitical observer in 1993, when the Oslo accords ushered in a new era in relations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, I thought that many Israelis had made up their minds about the accords based not on a careful review of their contents, but on assumptions. On the left were those who seemed to support any agreement so long as the process moved forward. On the right, many opposed any territorial compromise with the Palestinians, regardless of the where, when and how.</p>
        <p>But while I counted myself among those who were prepared to compromise with the Palestinians, I was gravely concerned that the assumptions underlying the Oslo process were fundamentally flawed and would not yield the historic reconciliation for which its proponents hoped.</p>
        <p>One problematic assumption concerned compliance. With no direct mechanism to hold the Palestinians accountable, the results were predictable. While Israel was transferring real land and releasing real prisoners, the Palestinians were strenuously avoiding their obligations, from extraditing terrorists to disarming militants. Unfortunately, the terrorism and violence that ensued did not cause the Rabin-Peres administration to consider how a flawed accord might be improved, but only convinced it of the need to move more quickly toward a final agreement. Instead of holding the Palestinians to their promises and establishing mutual trust, it looked only at the goal of peace.</p>
        <p>In negotiating the Wye Accord in 1998, the Benjamin Netanyahu government put reciprocity back on the agenda. It was agreed that each side would fulfill its commitments before the process went to the next stage. While I was hoping for other improvements, such as the linking of territorial concessions to the liberalization of the Palestinian regime, at least one gaping hole in Oslo had been filled.</p>
        <p>When Ehud Barak came to power, determined to breathe new life into the peace process, he quickly abandoned the principle of reciprocity. Now all Palestinian commitments have been forgotten and the days of good will gestures to the Palestinians for the sake of an improved climate of negotiation have returned.</p>
        <p>The wrongheadedness of this approach was proved last month; on the same day the prime minister was marshaling a vote in the Knesset to transfer areas on the outskirts of Jerusalem's Old City to the Palestinians, violence engulfed the territories. It is encouraging that Mr. Barak, a man I believe is firmly committed to Israel's security, has now decided to postpone this transfer and that even members of Israel's far left are voicing concerns over the bloated Palestinian police force and the stockpiling of illegal weapons.</p>
        <p>But I fear that as quiet returns, the allure of peace will again affect the otherwise sound judgment of much of the current government. Israel must return to the principle of reciprocity.</p>
        <p>In making painful compromises, we must demand the same in return. Giving the Palestinians Abu Dis, an area only a few meters from Jerusalem's old city, on a silver platter will not help us achieve that goal. If Mr. Barak really intends to reach a final agreement resolving the thorniest issues, then why is he willing to transfer Abu Dis without demanding a concession in return? If, as he has stated, he is giving it as a down payment, one wonders how the full bill can be paid while preserving the undivided capital of which he has so repeatedly spoken.</p>
        <p>Moreover, if the Palestinian Authority can get a toehold into the eastern part of Jerusalem without extraditing a terrorist or changing a textbook, why should it ever agree to the painful compromises that are the only way to bring real reconciliation?</p>
        <p>The Palestinians will not easily embrace compromise; nor is more violence unlikely. But if the Jewish people are not prepared to hold their ground in the city that for 2,000 years kept the dream of Jewish sovereignty alive, I shudder to think of where we are willing to draw the line.</p>
