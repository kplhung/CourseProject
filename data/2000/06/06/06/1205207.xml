        <p>Despite his distaste for Patrick J. Buchanan's conservative views on social issues, Ross Perot, the founder of the Reform Party and its two-time presidential candidate, has all but ruled out running against Mr. Buchanan for the party nomination this year, a spokesman for Mr. Perot said yesterday.</p>

        <p>Despite his distaste for Patrick J. Buchanan's conservative views on social issues, Ross Perot, the founder of the Reform Party and its two-time presidential candidate, has all but ruled out running against Mr. Buchanan for the party nomination this year, a spokesman for Mr. Perot said yesterday.</p>
        <p>''There's no way someone could get in now and compete for the presidential nomination,'' said the spokesman, Russell J. Verney, a former Reform Party national chairman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Verney added that Mr. Perot had no plans to engineer an 11th-hour campaign to put himself in contention for the nomination through a balloting process that begins next month and ends on the eve of the party convention in August.</p>
        <p>Mr. Verney's statement seems to remove the last bit of uncertainty over whether Mr. Buchanan will win the third-party nomination and the $12.5 million in federal campaign funds that go with it.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Verney emphasized that staying out of the race did not necessarily reflect Mr. Perot's support for Mr. Buchanan, even though it was largely at Mr. Perot's invitation that Mr. Buchanan left the Republican Party last year to join the Reform movement.</p>
        <p>Rather, Mr. Verney expressed concern that Mr. Buchanan was ultimately less interested in winning the White House than in presiding over an ''ideologically pure right-wing party'' that reflected his deeply held beliefs on social issues like abortion and homosexuality, which the Reform Party platform has ignored for the sake of party unity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan, a political commentator and ex-White House speech writer, sought to deflect the accusation yesterday in an interview with Political Points, the Webcast of The New York Times and ABC News.</p>
        <p>''I'm criticized on the one hand by social conservatives,'' he said. ''They say, 'You've abandoned right-to-life, Pat, and you're not talking about the social issues.' On the other hand, there are Reform Party opposition folks who say, 'All you're talking about is right-to-life and the social issues.' ''</p>
        <p>''The point of the matter is I've never abandoned my views and philosophy,'' he said. ''I am pro-life.''</p>
        <p>He said he had indicated that in announcing his candidacy.</p>
        <p>Much of the concern about Mr. Buchanan's intentions focuses on what he and his allies could do with the Reform platform. While the popular vote determines the party's nominee -- virtually any registered voter can cast a ballot -- a nominee supported by two-thirds of the delegates can rewrite the platform and its preamble, both of which are currently silent on social issues. Party rules also provide for a two-thirds vote of the delegates to overturn the popular choice of presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>No one from Mr. Buchanan's campaign has said unequivocally that he would not alter the platform or preamble if he was nominated. Paul Truax, the party's southwest regional representative, said yesterday that Buchanan officials ''have told us repeatedly they would not make a change this year.''</p>
        <p>''But we just don't know,'' Mr. Truax said. ''Are we supposed to be satisfied for just this year? We don't know.''</p>
        <p>To win a place on the Reform presidential primary ballot, a candidate has to demonstrate through signature petitions that he has sufficient support across the country to be a viable challenger to the major party nominees, who this year are likely to be Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>So far Mr. Buchanan has helped get the Reform Party on the ballot in almost 30 states, and he is well on his way to securing the delegates he would need if he wanted to alter the party platform. After state conventions last weekend in Iowa, California and Rhode Island, he estimated that he had won the support of almost half of the 596 national convention delegates.</p>
        <p>''So we're really marching toward the nomination,'' Mr. Buchanan said.</p>
        <p>Still, opposition remains. In the absence of Mr. Perot, some Reform leaders are backing John Hagelin of the nascent Natural Law Party. Reform Party officials opposed to Mr. Buchanan have been helping the Hagelin campaign generate support among Reform members who feel more comfortable with the party platform as it was written with Mr. Perot at the helm.</p>
        <p>Those issues focus on government reform as the party's major thrust, positions that the Natural Law Party embraces in a variety of areas, including education, health care and the environment. Like the current Reform Party, the Natural Law Party takes no official position on abortion or other social issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hagelin, a research physicist from Connecticut who now lives in Iowa, predicted that he would win the popular vote over Mr. Buchanan because his politics appealed to a broader base of support.</p>
        <p>Opponents to Mr. Buchanan are also trying to ease his tightening grip on the party infrastructure. In addition to collecting signatures and wooing delegates, he has enjoyed widespread success in helping place supporters in major state party positions. In at least three states -- Delaware, Maryland and Wyoming -- the state party chairman, who is ostensibly supposed to project neutrality, is also the Buchanan state campaign chairman.</p>
        <p>And two members of the national convention credentials committee, which controls who gets seated, are Buchanan chairmen in their states, Alaska and Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>After Donna Donovan, the party press secretary since 1997, recently pointed out what she perceived as conflicts of interests to Gerald M. Moan, the party national chairman, Mr. Moan dismissed her. As he said in a memorandum to party members, Ms. Donovan's ''recent activities violate my own principles of impartiality.''</p>
        <p>Some Buchanan supporters say the efforts to derail him, especially by Perot supporters, are sour grapes because they have lost party control. David Goldman, a senior party official in Florida who was once a Perot and Verney loyalist, said he had broken with them to support Mr. Buchanan because of what he called ''fraudulent behavior.''</p>
        <p>As examples, Mr. Goldman cited former Gov. Richard Lamm of Colorado, Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota and Mr. Buchanan as people they had invited to join the party and help expand its base, only to turn on them when they began to generate support. ''They would rather blow up the party than allow people like Ventura and Buchanan to have control,'' he said.</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE REFORM PARTY  Correction:  June 8, 2000, Thursday  An article on Tuesday about Ross Perot's inclination against running for the Reform Party nomination for president referred inaccurately to party officials' approach to Patrick J. Buchanan. Senior party officials have said that associates of Mr. Perot let Mr. Buchanan know he was welcome to seek the nomination. Russell J. Verney, an associate of Mr. Perot, did not say that Mr. Perot invited Mr. Buchanan to run.</p>
