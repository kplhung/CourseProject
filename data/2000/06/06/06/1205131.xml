        <p>Evolution has not always come up with things people consider wonderful. Note mosquitoes, sickle cell anemia and the killer instinct. But according to evolutionary theory, there is a reason for everything that has evolved. However obnoxious it may seem, somehow it enhances survival.</p>
        <p>And so it seems that survival is the likely reason for morning sickness, survival not just of the unborn child but also of the pregnant woman who must bear the burden of its prenatal development. That is the conclusion of two Cornell University evolutionary biologists after examining the results of nearly 80,000 successful and unsuccessful pregnancies, correlating their findings with the incidence of morning sickness and the development during early pregnancy of food aversions and cravings.</p>
        <p>MOTHER AND BABY BENEFIT -- Samuel M. Flaxman, a graduate student, and Dr. Paul W. Sherman, a professor of neurobiology and behavior, report in the current issue of the Quarterly Review of Biology that nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, which they call N.V.P., helps to protect both mother and fetus from exposure to infectious organisms and toxic chemicals that could result in fetal damage, miscarriage or even, in primitive societies at least, maternal death.</p>
        <p>Morning sickness, these researchers note, is a misnomer. It can occur at any time of the day (though not at night while a woman is asleep) and, they insist, it is not a sickness. It is a 100 percent normal characteristic of early pregnancy that is associated with a reduced risk of miscarriage and a greater chance that the pregnancy will have a healthy outcome. All nine studies that have explored this relationship in about 20,000 pregnancies showed that women who experienced the condition were significantly less likely to miscarry.</p>
        <p>Rather than morning sickness, N.V.P. should be called ''wellness insurance,'' Dr. Sherman said. Worldwide and in the United States, two-thirds of pregnant women acquire this free insurance to varying degrees.</p>
        <p>The idea is that a pregnant woman afflicted with nausea and vomiting will be unlikely to eat certain foods that may be damaging to her fetus when its major organ systems are developing. Organ development takes place during the first three months of pregnancy, which is when morning sickness is most prominent. ''There is an obvious -- indeed striking -- correspondence between the sensitive periods in embryonic organogenesis and the peak occurrence of N.V.P.,'' the scientists wrote.</p>
        <p>At this time, too, the Cornell biologists noted, a pregnant woman's immune system is naturally suppressed to keep her from rejecting the fetus as a foreign tissue. But immune suppression renders her more susceptible to food-borne parasites and microorganisms and the toxins they produce, so N.V.P. would protect her, too.</p>
        <p>THE MAIN PROBLEM -- While other theorists, like Dr. Margie Profet of the University of California at Berkeley, have suggested that morning sickness evolved to protect the embryo and young fetus from exposure to natural dietary toxins in vegetables, spices and some fruits that might cause malformations, the Cornell researchers' exhaustive analysis of all existing evidence gathered since 1940 has indicated that meat, poultry, fish and eggs are far more important sources of possible pregnancy problems. Until refrigeration, these foods were most likely to harbor infectious and toxic organisms that could sicken a pregnant woman, damage her fetus or cause an abortion.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Cornell report found, the meat category leads the list of food aversions that develop during pregnancy; nonalcoholic beverages like coffee come second, and vegetables a distant third. Having completely lost my appetite for meat and coffee during my own pregnancy, I am inclined to think the Cornell biologists are right on target. For most pregnant women suffering from nausea and vomiting, bland carbohydrate foods like bread, cereal and grains have the greatest appeal, though cravings for fruit and fruit juice, desserts, ice cream and sometimes unusual foods are commonplace. Studies have shown that very few pregnant women crave alcohol, which is a cause of fetal malformations.</p>
        <p>In further support of their theory, the Cornell team examined dietary patterns in seven nonindustrial societies where pregnant women never or rarely experience morning sickness and compared the results with 20 similar societies in which it occurs. Those societies without morning sickness ''were significantly less likely to have meat as a dietary staple'' and were ''significantly more likely to have corn as a dietary staple,'' the scientists wrote.</p>
        <p>Also intriguing are the different rates of pregnancy-related nausea in industrialized societies that have different dietary habits. The highest frequency was in Japan, a nation fond of eating raw fish, where 84 percent of the pregnant women in one study reported experiencing nausea and vomiting. Raw fish, a dietary no-no during pregnancy in this country, can carry parasites that could harm a fetus in addition to making the pregnant woman quite ill. Likewise, undercooked meat, popular in many Western countries where N.V.P. frequencies are high, can carry a parasite called toxoplasma that causes serious congenital defects.</p>
        <p>But even cooked meat that is not spoiled can be a problem, Dr. Sherman said. If the meat sat around unrefrigerated for a while, it could become contaminated with pathogens like E. coli even though it looks and smells fine, he explained. His evolution-based conclusion: ''A pregnant woman's body responds to the smell and taste of meat because this category of food in general can be dangerous.''</p>
        <p>The Cornell biologists do not dispute the role that the hormones of pregnancy are known to play in touching off morning sickness. Rather, Dr. Sherman said, ''the hormones explain how this happens.''</p>
        <p>''We're asking why it happens,'' he said. ''Why do the hormones cause these particular symptoms of nausea and vomiting and food aversions? Why not headaches or backaches?'' Their answer is that nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy is protective; it helps to guarantee the next generation will be healthy.</p>
        <p>Studies suggest that morning sickness has a genetic component. Women are much more likely to experience it if their mothers or sisters were also susceptible. Forms of morning sickness have also been observed in domestic dogs and captive rhesus monkeys and chimpanzees.</p>
        <p>WHAT SHOULD A WOMAN DO? -- Women who do not experience morning sickness should not fret, Dr. Sherman said, if they live in countries where the food supply is safe. But neither should heroic measures be taken to prevent ''normal'' nausea and vomiting. The best way to alleviate the problem is always to have some food in one's stomach. Hence, the common advice to keep crackers on the night table and to eat several before getting out of bed in the morning.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sherman said he saw ''no reason to believe that suppressing the symptoms of N.V.P. would improve the outcome of a pregnancy'' unless a woman developed hyperemesis, continual vomiting that occurs in only half of 1 percent of pregnancies and which requires hospital treatment. Ordinary morning sickness, he said, ''is a phenomenon that is adaptive, not pathological. It's not a symptom of a failing female body. It's a temporary condition that occurs early in pregnancy when fetal demands are small and would not be a major drain on a woman's resources.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Sherman also sees no reason to force a pregnant woman to consume any foods to which she has developed an aversion. In most women, aversions that start in the first trimester dissipate during the second along with a waning of nausea.</p>
        <p>Of course, all pregnant women should be taking daily prenatal vitamin-mineral supplements, which help compensate for any nutrients missing while suffering from N.V.P. Most important in the first months of pregnancy is folic acid (or folate), which has been shown to greatly reduce the risk that the baby will suffer a spinal defect when consumed at a level of 400 micrograms a day. Since January 1998, flour and grain products (foods that are unlikely to be on a pregnant woman's list of aversions) have been fortified with folic acid.</p>
