        <p>President Jacques Chirac proposed today that France's presidential term be shortened from seven years to five, a move that could profoundly change the nature of French politics and help him in the next elections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac had long opposed such a change, saying that the country's 42-year-old Constitution worked just fine as it is. Only last July, he called the idea ''a mistake.''</p>
        <p>But in a televised interview this evening, the 67-year-old president said he believes that cutting the presidential term is necessary to modernize France's democracy.</p>
        <p>''It's clear it's a long time, '' Mr. Chirac said of the seven-year term. ''Probably too long, in view of the demands of a modern democracy.''</p>
        <p>Opinion polls indicate that more than 75 percent of the French population support such a change. A shorter term has been proposed by most of the presidential candidates in the last three decades, but their enthusiasm has always dwindled once they were in office.</p>
        <p>Right now, however, Mr. Chirac could gain from the shorter term. He will turn 70 in 2002, when the next elections are scheduled. If the presidential term is only five years long, his age may be less of a factor in the voting.</p>
        <p>He said he is vehemently opposed to any other constitutional changes, such as limiting the number of terms a president can serve or strengthening the Parliament's powers. Such measures had been suggested by former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, but not until he was long out of office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac, a Gaullist, said he would use his presidential powers to stop any measure if amendments were tacked onto the bill during the approval process in the legislature, which is largely controlled by France's Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac is likely to face Mr. Jospin in the next elections. Some political analysts believe that Mr. Chirac acted today in part to keep his rival, who has often called for a shorter presidential term, from using the issue against him in 2002.</p>
        <p>A change in the length of the presidential term could have a far-reaching impact on French politics. Many hope that putting the presidency and the legislators on a matching five-year cycle would help reduce the awkward periods of ''cohabitation,'' such as the one France is experiencing now, when the president and the prime minister belong to different parties.</p>
        <p>At least three times in the last 15 years, the French have elected a president and then a few years later changed course and elected a majority of legislators from another party. If the elections were held simultaneously, that would be far less likely to happen.</p>
        <p>The periods of ''cohabitation'' are often tense, because the president tends to lose much of his power, and lines of authority between the two executives are not clearly drawn.</p>
