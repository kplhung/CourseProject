        <p>Shane Mosley knows he is not meant to be the attraction when he steps into the boxing ring June 17 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''People are calling this the Oscar De La Hoya fight,'' Mosley said yesterday in a conference call with reporters. ''The casual boxing fan is saying, 'Who is this Shane Mosley?' But actually, I am the experienced one. I am not the new kid on the block. I know all about De La Hoya. I know him very well.''</p>
        <p>The two fought as amateurs 16 years ago, when Mosley was 12 years old and De La Hoya was 11. Both were up-and-coming fighters in the Los Angeles area, and Mosley said De La Hoya wanted to test himself against an older, slightly bigger fighter.</p>
        <p>Mosley won the fight. He also later sparred with De La Hoya when De La Hoya was getting ready for the 1992 Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>Asked what he remembered about his ring experiences with De La Hoya, Mosley answered: We threw a lot of jabs and I felt I could hit him whenever I wanted to. I didn't make much of our fight when I was 12. I was always the guy to beat. I didn't know Oscar was going to become the famous guy.</p>
        <p>Mosley, the former International Boxing Federation lightweight champion, is undefeated in 34 professional fights with 32 knockouts. But he is moving up two weight classes, to welterweight, to fight De La Hoya, who lost for the first time in 33 fights nine months ago, to Felix Trinidad.</p>
