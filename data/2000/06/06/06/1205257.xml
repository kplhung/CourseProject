        <p>You might think these are tough times in the city that George Eastman built.</p>
        <p>His Eastman Kodak Company, for close to a century the city's reason for being, is now a shadow of its former self, and its future is cloudy. Xerox, which was founded here, is once more laying off thousands of people and struggling to regain some kind of financial footing. Bausch &amp; Lomb, the third pillar of Rochester's economy, has been jettisoning businesses and people.</p>
        <p>Yet you do not hear the blues much in this green city near Lake Ontario. Because against all odds, small companies have been filling the job gap.</p>
        <p>Almost invisibly, in low-slung factories to the west of town and anonymous office parks to the east, tiny companies have been springing up all over Rochester: computer software companies, telecommunications companies, medical equipment companies, high-tech manufacturing companies, Internet companies. And they are hungry for workers.</p>
        <p>In Rochester today, almost anyone suddenly unemployed ''is getting gobbled up by existing technology businesses,'' said Brian E. Hickey, executive vice president of the M &amp; T Bank.</p>
        <p>The jobless rate in Rochester hovers around 4 percent, roughly where it has been since 1996, and the overall number of jobs just hit 555,000, surpassing the number in Buffalo for the first time. Every year for the last three, state economists have had to revise Rochester's job count upward by thousands of positions; big companies fill out surveys more readily than little ones, which often show up in state records only when they pay their unemployment insurance taxes.</p>
        <p>Of course, the shift from a company town to a town full of little companies is by no means complete -- or assured. Total job growth in Rochester remains lower than the statewide average. And the Milken Institute, a high-tech research organization, ranks Rochester just 71st out of 315 metropolitan areas based on the concentration of high-tech business. Silicon Valley is not shaking in its expensive sneakers.</p>
        <p>When you want to start a business, ''Rochester is not the first place that comes to mind,'' said Christopher M. Campbell, who left a ''comfy cozy corporate position'' to found Clean Dry Air in 1998. ''Hopefully, that's changing.''</p>
        <p>The change has not been easy, not for the people involved, not for the city government, not for the self-image of a place once so self-satisfied that it was called Smugtown.</p>
        <p>There was, perhaps, a lot to be smug about. Even today, the area around Rochester remains extremely prosperous, full of grand houses and stately trees and glossy shopping centers. In May, every green spot is spangled with lilacs, and the city's suburban schools continue to rank as some of the best in the country.</p>
        <p>There is not much need for networking in Rochester -- everyone turns up at Little League games or in line at Wegmans, the local grocery chain. Corpses do sometimes turn up in the Genesee River, to be sure, but they are more likely to be victims of canoe accidents than of criminal activity.</p>
        <p>Rochester began to boom with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, but it was Eastman who really put the place on the map. It was not just that he pretty much invented film and brought photography to the masses. Eastman also had a hand in every aspect of Rochester's civic life. He founded the music school and the dental school, endowed the university, created the United Way.</p>
        <p>And, of course, there were the Eastman Kodak jobs. The company ''essentially guaranteed lifetime employment, not only for yourself but for your family members,'' said William A. Johnson Jr., Rochester's mayor. Paternalistic in the extreme, Kodak took care of its people with cushy positions, high salaries and great benefits. The work force was and is highly educated, with an emphasis on engineering.</p>
        <p>In midcentury, the Haloid Company, soon to be known as Xerox, became the Microsoft of its day. By the early 1980's, ''if you figured in the companies servicing Xerox and Kodak, they were responsible for three quarters of the economy, easily,'' said Kent Gardner, director of economic analysis for the Center for Governmental Research (which was founded by you-know-who).</p>
        <p>A handful of business leaders ran the city. When the developer who had started building a Hyatt hotel downtown abandoned it in the late 1980's (he was not, locals note, from Rochester), it was a small group of businessmen who put up the money to finish the job.</p>
        <p>In the early 1990's, things began to change. Kodak, facing fierce competition from overseas and suffering from disastrous forays into new businesses, had been maintaining what many called a bloated bureaucracy. George M. C. Fisher, the chief executive appointed in 1993, made it clear that he had to save the company, not run the city.</p>
        <p>The company began laying off tens of thousands of people. In the early 1980's, more than 60,000 people worked at Kodak in Rochester; now, the company says, there are fewer than 25,000 workers. At its peak, Kodak accounted for almost a quarter of the city's payroll; today, that figure is just over 10 percent, according to the Center for Governmental Research.</p>
        <p>What happened to all those people?</p>
        <p>Some have obviously moved away to seek work; the population of metropolitan Rochester has been edging down since 1994 (it is now just over one million, though there has not been an exodus as from Buffalo).</p>
        <p>Many others became ''consultants,'' here as elsewhere a code word for ''probably retired.''</p>
        <p>Thomas T. Mooney, president of the Greater Rochester Metro Chamber of Commerce, estimates that 20 percent were ''outsourced,'' meaning that they continued to have almost the same jobs, just not under Kodak's name.</p>
        <p>As for the rest, he said, ''Our sense is that the majority stayed and found gainful employment.''</p>
        <p>They found it at places like the Sutherland Group, which was founded in 1986 by a refugee from Xerox. Sutherland, which is hired by other companies to handle their customer relations, now employs 2,400 people, including about 1,200 in Rochester.</p>
        <p>They include people like Richard E. Clouser, director of sales operations, who spent 28 years at Kodak, and Ronald B. Knight, chief operating officer, who retired from Xerox after 30 years. Both men said the adjustment to a smaller company has been rewarding -- but not easy.</p>
        <p>In his first few weeks at Sutherland, Mr. Knight recalled, he was asked to handle a customer's request. ''By the time I figured it out, someone else did the job,'' he said, with chagrin still in his voice. ''We move quickly here.''</p>
        <p>The adjustment is not always easy on the company side, either. Daniel J. Lang, Sutherland's president, said that not everyone he has brought in from a corporation has worked out. The sticking points, he said, are culture, status and money: like most of the small companies, Sutherland pays far more modest salaries than the big corporations, but offers large performance bonuses.</p>
        <p>Chatting with some Sutherland employees in a conference room, it is easy to discover that many of them could easily have moved away, but chose not to. Life in Rochester, they said, is too cheap and too good.</p>
        <p>Joseph J. Buggy, originally from Philadelphia, decided to stay in Rochester even after the engineering firm he worked for left, because his family loves the area; it does not hurt that the golf is great. He does allow that sometimes the city still feels a little insular, especially when he watches the evening news. (''Out of 30 minutes, 28 1/2 are about Monroe County.'')</p>
        <p>Similarly, Johnson Au-Yeung, the chief technology officer, says he sometimes ''misses the big-city ambience.''</p>
        <p>''At 10 p.m. on a Friday night,'' he said, ''there's nowhere to go unless you go to a bar.'' Nevertheless, he raved about the low cost of real estate and the easy commuting, all so different from his family's home in Jackson Heights, Queens.</p>
        <p>Another striking thing about the Sutherland employees is that they appeared uninterested in joining a start-up company, the dream of so many Manhattanites. ''I want to go to growth, to learn something new,'' said Barbara McManus, who until recently worked for Bausch &amp; Lomb. But, she said, ''I wanted something that was already started.''</p>
        <p>In fact, relatively few of the corporate refugees have actually started businesses of their own, said Mr. Gardner of the Center for Governmental Research.</p>
        <p>Just ask Paul Wetenhall. Once an employee of Xerox, he runs a software company, and now spends four days a week as ''venture coach'' at the Lennox Tech Enterprise Center, a business incubator near the Rochester Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>Even if they once worked at a big company, most of his entrepreneurs have experience being on their own and understand what it takes, he said. Like Bruce P. Sidari, who in May was bolting together his own office furniture at the center. Mr. Sidari has worked at Kodak, it is true, but he has worked at a lot of places, including for himself, before starting an Internet employment company, Emp Tek Inc.</p>
        <p>Entrepreneurs often find it hard to find time for their families, much less for the civic duties that consumed George Eastman and his heirs, Mr. Wetenhall said. Indeed, until he took the job at the incubator, which is affiliated with the Chamber of Commerce, it did not even occur to him to join that group. Entrepreneurs, he said, ''tend not to be too plugged in to the community.''</p>
        <p>That is hard for Rochester to adjust to. Priding itself on its civic participation, this city is still wrestling with the effects of downsizing.</p>
        <p>At the United Way, Kodak's corporate gift has fallen by more than $1 million since 1992, to $2.4 million this year. And as Kodak cuts back, so do other corporations.</p>
        <p>Just as difficult are the layoffs of individual workers, often men who pledged $500 a year, said Joseph G. Calabrese, the charity's president. Meanwhile, the charity is lucky if new participants pledge $50 -- and it has to talk to two people for every pledge. So to replace one former donor, the United Way must contact 20 people.</p>
        <p>''We have to make more and more calls and visits and presentations to more and more people,'' Mr. Calabrese said. For the first time, this year, the United Way raffled off cars to lure people to its presentations.</p>
        <p>Business and civic leaders also complain of a leadership void -- that no one has stepped in to replace the old corporate chieftains who tackled the city's problems. And there are problems, including serious troubles in schools in poor downtown neighborhoods, high air fares that help isolate the city, and some sections of downtown that could use a lift.</p>
        <p>And then, there is what could delicately be called the image problem. Companies are not moving to Rochester; neither, more ominously, are people, even those looking for high-tech jobs. Such people need to feel ''that if you get a job in one company and it doesn't work out, you can go down the street and find another one,'' said Peter Holloran, a marketing executive.</p>
        <p>He is helping Rochester to put together its first major sales campaign, long after cities from Atlanta to Cleveland have already done so. Why has it taken so long? ''Rochester never sunk far enough,'' he said. ''The Genesee River never went up in flames.''</p>
        <p>The mayor and other civic leaders are working on some other efforts, too. They hope somehow to encourage more of a night life in downtown Rochester, and also want to develop more housing in the center city for young people who do not long to live in the suburbs.</p>
        <p>And they have talked to the presidents of the universities in and around Rochester, asking them to reach out to their alumni who might be willing to move back to Rochester to fill the new jobs that the smaller companies are creating.</p>
        <p>''We've never had that in our job description; we never think about bringing them back,'' said Albert J. Simone, president of Rochester Institute of Technology. But, he says, he will. ''If it weren't for downsizing, these employers would be all over me.''</p>
        <p>The Other Economy  Upstate New York, a vast, diverse landscape of old cities, small towns, farms and forests stretching from Buffalo to Albany and north to the Canadian border, was once one of the most populous and prosperous regions of the country. But the national economic boom that swept into New York City and its suburbs passed it by. This is the second in a series of articles examining the region's quest for prosperity. A previous article discussed the population drain in Buffalo.</p>
