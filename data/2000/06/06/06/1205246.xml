        <p>Moving to enliven its tightly controlled local media in the face of slicker foreign offerings, Singapore said it would turn its two media monopolies into duopolies. The minister for information and the arts, Lee Yock Suan, said the government-owned broadcaster, the Media Corporation of Singapore, would be allowed to publish a daily newspaper for commuters. Singapore Press Holdings, meanwhile, will be allowed to apply for two radio licenses and two television licenses. The government said that it would not lift the 3 percent limit on ownership of a local media company by a single foreign investor but that it would review its ban on satellite dishes in 2002.</p>
