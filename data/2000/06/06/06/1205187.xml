        <p>Betty S. Beene, who as president of United Way of America since January 1997 has been rebuilding the public perception of the charitable fund-raising organization, said yesterday that she planned to retire in 18 months.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Beene, 53, said she announced her plans far in advance partly to win support for her efforts to give United Way of America greater control over the use of the organization's name and logo by the 1,400 local United Ways.</p>
        <p>''You get better and more courageous decisions if the incumbent executive will not benefit from those decisions,'' Mrs. Beene said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Beene has supported having United Way of America in Alexandria, Va., process pledges made by workers at national companies. The $12 million project collapsed last year when Cap Gemini, the vendor, could not make it work during a test.</p>
        <p>Several large local United Ways, which already run pledge processing centers, oppose having United Way of America do this work.</p>
