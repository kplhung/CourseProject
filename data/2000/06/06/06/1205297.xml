        <p>Pablo Trinidad's standout performance led Monroe to a 7-5 victory over Tottenville yesterday in the Public Schools Athletic League Class A baseball championship at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Not only did Trinidad pitch six stellar innings of relief and drive in four runs for the Bronx school, but also his two-out, two-run single in a four-run sixth inning furnished the tie-breaking runs that gave Monroe the victory.</p>
        <p>''I'm just so proud of these kids, especially Pablo,'' Monroe Coach Mike Turo said. ''He gave us an M.V.P. performance today when we needed it.''</p>
        <p>After Trinidad had driven in the game's first run with a single in the top of the first, the Pirates from Staten Island scored four times in the bottom half off Monroe's starting pitcher, Randy Guzman. Matt Hegel singled in two runs and Troy Esposito delivered another.</p>
        <p>''I knew I had to stay positive and hold them,'' said Trinidad, who struck out Tottenville's Demi Vieira to end the game after he and his teammates rallied to take the lead.</p>
