        <p>Bill T. Jones is not dancing, but Nigel Redden is. It has been that kind of year here at Spoleto Festival U.S.A.</p>
        <p>Mr. Redden, the festival's general director, has become quicker on his feet since 1998, when he took over the Lincoln Center Festival, too, only to become mired in an international flap over the Chinese opera ''The Peony Pavilion'' when its troupe was detained in Shanghai. It took him a year to snatch triumph from the jaws of defeat there by presenting the opera with a newly assembled company.</p>
        <p>Now comes a star-crossed season at Spoleto, and Mr. Redden is hopping. The first crisis was the growing controversy in recent months over the Confederate battle flag that flies above the state Capitol in Columbia. Several performers withdrew from the festival in protest, including the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, and would-be festivalgoers have boycotted in unknowable numbers. Ticket sales, which were 17 percent ahead of last year in February, are now 10 percent behind.</p>
        <p>But that figure reflects other factors as well, including a second crisis: a severe spinal injury to the director of another company, Antoine Rigot of the French circus troupe Les Colporteurs. (A tightrope performer, he was injured off the job, while swimming.) Mr. Redden acted quickly, bringing in David Dimitri, a French performer known to the troupe. Nine of the 14 scheduled performances will be lost, it appears, obviously affecting ticket sales, but most of the troupe's planned run at the Lincoln Center Festival next month is expected to take place.</p>
        <p>Mr. Redden's approach to the flag issue was necessarily subtler and more multifaceted. Some of the boycotting performers were replaced. And three thematic events were added, including an outdoor concert on Friday and addresses and readings by Southern writers on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''For many, the flag controversy is behind us,'' Mr. Redden said, ''for better or for worse.'' The State Legislature has decided to remove the flag on July 1 to a Confederate soldiers' monument on the Capitol grounds, where a monument to black slaves is also to be installed.</p>
        <p>Still, the writers' session, in the Riviera at Charleston Place, was impassioned. Kendra Hamilton, a black writer from Charleston, tied together the recurring themes, challenging the familiar argument that what is being upheld by the flag and similar symbols is heritage rather than hate. ''Heritage slides very easily into hate,'' Ms. Hamilton said. She advocated instead a shift from heritage to history given a cold, hard look.</p>
        <p>The concert, in a lovely setting at the Cistern on the College of Charleston campus, offered an inspiriting set of gospel songs by the Brotherhood, a septet from nearby Mount Pleasant, S.C., and a performance of Copland's ''Lincoln Portrait'' by Steven Sloane and the festival orchestra, narrated by State Senator McKinley Washington.</p>
        <p>At least two of the scheduled musical events also spoke to the notion of a changing epoch, whether or not tied to a dawning century or millennium. The official festival concert, on Thursday, offered the American premiere of ''Surrogate Cities,'' a sonic boom of a symphony from 1994 by Heiner Goebbels, a pathbreaking German composer. This work, everywhere amplified, draws much of its driving energy from rock. It turns the symphony orchestra on its head, so that percussion dominates; the brasses fill out the sound, and strings and woodwinds often provide little more than local color.</p>
        <p>The sheer exhilarating sonic assault, heavy with sampling and with vocal effects that could pass for it (or for percussion), is barely suggested in a new recording from ECM (which of course also forgoes the visual assault of spotlights repeatedly searching the stage and the audience). It gave one listener a first sense of what it must have been like to hear a big Mahler symphony a century ago, with the whole notion of sonic possibility expanded at a stroke.</p>
        <p>This basic texture made all the more striking the isolated moments of conventional beauty, like the old recording of a haunting cantorial song, gently lifted, as it were, out of the rubble. Or rubble it seemed. Literary meaning is elusive in this work, with inspiration from Kafka and dimly scrutable texts by Paul Auster and others, and the program book afforded little help.</p>
        <p>That sense of finding jewels amid rubble was enhanced by the setting, the Memminger Auditorium, an old building abandoned after Hurricane Hugo blew its roof off in 1989 and partly restored for the purpose. Here was an opportunity for Charleston, so immersed in its ancient history (not to say heritage), to reconnect with its more recent history as well. The performance by Mr. Sloane and the festival orchestra was a knockout, at times almost literally, and David Moss supplied most of those remarkable vocal effects.</p>
        <p>The other work that conveyed a sense of epochal change was far more modest: Bright Sheng's opera ''Silver River,'' which had its premiere in 1997 at the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival. Mr. Sheng uses an ancient Chinese folk myth ''of a perfect 'heavenly love' that can exist even between different species,'' in his words, as a metaphor for a sort of ultimate Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk, unifying theater with opera, both Western and Chinese. David Henry Hwang's deft libretto turns precious at times. The music seldom does. Mr. Sheng proves remarkably successful at juxtaposing Asian and Western idioms in more or less ''pure'' forms. With due respect to several wonderful performances on Friday evening, especially those of Karen Kandel as the Golden Buffalo and Jamie Gwan as the Jade Emperor, it was wondrous to hear the romance between David Fedele's flute and Wu Man's pipa.</p>
        <p>Notable among other events attended was Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier's production of Gluck's ''Iphigenie en Tauride'': notable on Saturday, it turned out, mainly for its dreariness, in its strained gestures of stock pity, terror or dementia, and in the often mistuned playing of the orchestra, again with Mr. Sloane conducting. In fairness, there were vocal consolations, especially the ringing Pylade of Tracey Welborn, and the rest of the audience seemed content.</p>
        <p>The festival runs until Sunday, when Mr. Redden can begin training for his next dance, at Lincoln Center.</p>
