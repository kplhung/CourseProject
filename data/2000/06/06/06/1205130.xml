        <p>Even doctors become impatient with it all. Sometimes, especially as they get older, they just begin to pay the studies less mind, and concentrate instead on what they have seen with their own eyes. At conferences they tend to lean their aging bones back in the chair and say to the young ones, ''I know all about those studies of A, B and C, and in my experience things are a little different.''</p>
        <p>The wisdom of medical experience can be delicious to accumulate and display. Unfortunately, it can also be quite dangerous -- as a recent case of hepatitis in a patient of mine clearly shows.</p>
        <p>My patient's hepatitis was entirely routine. He was sick for a week with the usual warning signs -- fatigue, achiness, a sudden dislike of strong odors. For another 10 days he was in bed nauseated, with a throbbing ache in the right side of his abdomen.</p>
        <p>His diagnosis was easy enough to make: his liver enzymes on a blood test were off the charts, 50 times as high as normal. His care was not particularly challenging either: with bed rest and fluids, he was better in a week.</p>
        <p>Now, a month later, he is still a little shaky but back at work. It will take another blood test to determine which hepatitis virus made him sick.</p>
        <p>The instructive parts of his case are actually not its medical details at all, but a few casual sentences the patient and I had exchanged before his hepatitis started. We were discussing whether he should start taking medications for his infection with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. His stage of infection was advanced enough that he probably should, but the decision of when to begin them was entirely up to him.</p>
        <p>''O.K.,'' he said, cheerful and efficient. ''I'm ready. I will start them tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>I shrugged. It was a Friday. ''You might as well give yourself the weekend off.''</p>
        <p>And that is exactly what he did. He took the weekend off, and by Monday morning he was not feeling very well at all. He dragged himself through the rest of the week, new pill bottles unopened, and by the time he stumbled to the lab for the blood tests that diagnosed his hepatitis, even thinking about the medications made him queasy. The bottles are still unopened.</p>
        <p>But suppose he had decided to start those pills on that Saturday after all?</p>
        <p>If he had, he would still have developed a whopping case of hepatitis, of course: it had begun to incubate well before our conversation took place. But he would have developed it just a few days after he started a set of new pills.</p>
        <p>It would have played out as a crystal-clear case of cause and effect, precisely timed and far too obvious to question. In big studies, none of the medications he was to start caused liver problems like his. Even so, I would have been hard- pressed to avoid blaming the drugs. Even if I had thought to consider a virus, I would probably have assumed that the drugs had activated the virus. How else to explain the course of events?</p>
        <p>My patient would have had a variety of tests, possibly even a liver biopsy. When he recovered I would have given him a different set of drugs, and warned him never to take any of the first again.</p>
        <p>I would also have started worrying about using those drugs in other patients, especially those with liver problems. I would have known, of course, that studies show hepatitis from those drugs is mild and rare. But I would have been wary of trusting the studies against my own experience.</p>
        <p>I would have mentioned my patient's case to colleagues all over the country, implying that they might want to think twice about those medications in their own patients. ''In my experience,'' I would have said, settling my aging bones in the chair, ''you can get into trouble with those.''</p>
        <p>And it would all have been utterly misguided, a mistake from beginning to end, misinformed by a fluke of personal experience.</p>
        <p>Only the tortuously slow studies designed to examine drug effects in thousands of people can begin to sort out this kind of coincidence from true cause and effect. Their glacial pace shows how difficult it is in medicine to dissect the powerful role of happenstance out of the way.</p>
        <p>And as for single startling cases of self-evident cause and effect: often their moral is simply how deceptive single startling cases of anything can be.</p>
