        <p>A Manhattan judge assailed a former union president yesterday for stealing more than $2 million from the low-paid school cafeteria workers and crossing guards he represented in Local 372.</p>
        <p>The official, Charles Hughes, was sentenced to three to nine years in prison. He is the most senior figure to plead guilty in a wide-ranging corruption scandal involving District Council 37, the umbrella union representing nearly 125,000 city workers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes was the 18th official of the umbrella union to plead guilty in an investigation that found rampant fraud among senior officials at the union. Justice William Leibovitz of State Supreme Court in Manhattan also sentenced Mildred Stephens, Local 372's former treasurer and controller, to probation. Ms. Stephens aided in the thefts but took no money herself, according to prosecutors.</p>
        <p>Investigators said yesterday that their investigation into the union was continuing.</p>
        <p>But to date, they said, they had  found only gross incompetence on the part of Stanley Hill, the umbrella union's president, not criminal conduct.</p>
        <p>A dissident union official who attended Mr. Hughes's sentencing yesterday criticized the punishment as too lenient and called for Mr. Hill to be brought to trial. ''If the whole organization is corrupt from his No. 1 assistant on down, it would seem to me that Stanley Hill bears some responsibility,'' said Ray Markey, president of local 1930, which represents 18,000 librarians and clerical workers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Markey also criticized Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for saying he felt ''very bad'' for Mr. Hughes and his family after the union leader pleaded guilty to grand larceny in April. Mr. Hughes raised money for the mayor's 1997 re-election campaign and appeared in a television commercial that year endorsing Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>While representing workers who made $10,000 to $20,000 a year, Mr. Hughes spent $340,000 of union funds on his personal credit card and $100,000 of union money on a trip he and 14 relatives and friends took to Egypt, Israel, Prague, Paris and London. He spent $97,000 in union funds on no-show jobs for friends in Millen, Ga., and stole $1.29 million in unearned and unauthorized pay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes's son, Martin, a union vice president, pleaded guilty on May 15 to conspiring with two other union officials, Joseph Alfano and Richard Louis, to steal $670,000 from the union. The thefts included $78,000 spent on Super Bowl tickets; $5,250 spent on Final Four college basketball tournament tickets; and $10,000 spent at topless clubs.</p>
        <p>Martin Hughes and Mr. Alfano, who pleaded guilty on May 23, face two to six years in jail. Mr. Louis, who was convicted at trial last Thursday, faces up to seven years in jail. Fraud and vote-rigging charges against two other union leaders, Albert A. Diop and Martin Lubin, are pending.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 8, 2000, Thursday  An article on Tuesday about the sentencing of a former union president who pleaded guilty to stealing more than $2 million misstated the title once held by Stanley Hill at the union's parent, District Council 37, which is being investigated by Manhattan prosecutors. Mr. Hill was executive director, not president.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the membership of an affiliated union, Local 1930, whose president found the corruption sentence of three to nine years too lenient. The local represents 1,800 librarians and clerical workers, not 18,000.</p>
