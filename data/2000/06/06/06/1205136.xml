        <p>The Battery Park lawn was littered Saturday with fashionable pop fans hitching a ride to the loftier echelons of pop. Transportation was provided by Stereolab, the decade-old Anglo-Francophone band that returned art rock from the territory of Tolkienesque comic book fantasy to its proper status as a complement to art school.</p>
        <p>With reference points ranging from prototypical electronic music to German progressive rock, Sun Ra, English feminist punk, Martin Denny and Duke Ellington, Stereolab is a good student's delight. But you don't have to be a record collector to enjoy the band's collages. They remain lovely as they spin off from their origins. When pushed, Stereolab's careful designs opened up and grew richer.</p>

        <p>The Battery Park lawn was littered Saturday with fashionable pop fans hitching a ride to the loftier echelons of pop. Transportation was provided by Stereolab, the decade-old Anglo-Francophone band that returned art rock from the territory of Tolkienesque comic book fantasy to its proper status as a complement to art school.</p>
        <p>With reference points ranging from prototypical electronic music to German progressive rock, Sun Ra, English feminist punk, Martin Denny and Duke Ellington, Stereolab is a good student's delight. But you don't have to be a record collector to enjoy the band's collages. They remain lovely as they spin off from their origins. When pushed, Stereolab's careful designs opened up and grew richer.</p>
        <p>The band's ability to stretch made it a sensible headliner for a Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival show. For all its dabbling in the tones and textures of jazz, this is still a rock band, grounded in ensemble riffing based on the guitarist Tim Gane's songwriting, not on solo flights. But when Stereolab hit its stride, the stylistic connections it made opened up its vistas, and affinity for jazz was more than an affectation.</p>
        <p>Innovation emerged within extended drones or in the vintage bleeping of Farfisa or Moog keyboards. The rub of Laetitia Staedler's vocals against those of the guitarist Mary Hansen enriched the songs. A heavy groove occasionally led the band into a boogie that ruffled the neat exteriors of its retro pop.</p>
        <p>Stereolab plays with form to discover how cultural categorizing breaks down. By subtly distorting styles meant to contain the unrest mainstream rock has exploited, like easy-listening psychedelia or extra-sweet 1960's pop, the group digs out the often unintentional messages within even banal generic exercises.</p>
        <p>Stereolab had this approach in place before its members became skilled musicians. Now their formulas are set. The percussionist Andy Ramsay, the bassist Simon Hughs, and the keyboardist Morgane Lhote exhibited cool precision. Their reliability is nearly becoming a detriment. The show was most engaging when the band risked going overboard.</p>
        <p>The evening's other two sets more easily fit within the boundaries of avant-garde jazz. Graham Haynes is a cornetist who uses hip-hop and techno-style sampling and sequencing to build intensely emotional soundscapes. Playing his horn in tandem with samples from Wagnerian opera and Indian classical music, as his band, which included a drummer, a D.J. and a keyboardist, stretched out, Mr. Haynes created a fruitful union of future-looking technology and straight jazz musicianship.</p>
        <p>A brief summit meeting of Yoko Ono, Thurston Moore and DJ Spooky delivered exactly what it advertised. Ms. Ono pushed her mostly nonverbal vocals toward agony and ecstasy while Mr. Moore assaulted his guitar with a drumstick, as he has many times in the band Sonic Youth, and DJ Spooky deployed turntables, a sampler and an upright bass in hip hop-flavored abstractions. This unrestrained wallop of sound showed three stars working their best tricks. Next to tidy Stereolab, it seemed totally indulgent. But such lack of design has its own charm.</p>
