        <p>On a night when their snipers failed to score, the Devils' role players, including two rookies, left the defending Stanley Cup champions facing elimination.</p>
        <p>Sergei Brylin, John Madden and Brian Rafalski broke open a tight-checking game by scoring three goals, including one short-handed, in a 3-minute-41-second span early in the period to propel the Devils to a 3-1, come-from-behind victory over the Dallas Stars.</p>
        <p>''It's been pretty good so far,'' Rafalski said of the Devils' quest for the Stanley Cup. ''But 15 wins don't win the Stanley Cup,'' he said. ''We need 16.''</p>
        <p>Bobby Holik and several other Devils were not surprised by the offensive contribution from unexpected sources.</p>
        <p>''I've been saying for the last two months that this is a team, and we expect everybody to contribute,'' Holik said. ''If it wasn't these guys,'' he said of Brylin, Madden and Rafalski, ''it would be someone else.''</p>
        <p>With the Devils trailing by 1-0, Brylin, the small Russian wing, started the Devils' explosion 2:27 into the period, when he converted a rebound from a shot by Alexander Mogilny directly in front of Ed Belfour. For Brylin, who scored nine goals in the regular season, it was his third of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''The tying goal gave us a big lift,'' Coach Larry Robinson said after the game. ''Breaking the tie was an even bigger lift,'' he said of the short-handed goal by Madden. ''A short-handed goal in the Stanley Cup finals can devastate anyone.''</p>
        <p>Short-handed goals are Madden's specialty, along with killing penalties, of course. Madden, who had six short-handed goals in the regular season to set a franchise record, scored his biggest short-handed goal of the season, giving the Devils the lead at 4:51.</p>
        <p>Madden broke away on the right wing and beat Belfour from near the bottom of the right circle, the same spot he had missed the target wide seconds earlier, for his third goal of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Rafalski, who has combined with Scott Stevens on defense against the top line of every opponent in the playoffs, made the score 3-1 just 17 seconds later when he sped down the left wing and beat Belfour between the legs from the bottom of the left circle.</p>
        <p>''I jumped off the bench, I waited for our guys to clear the zone,'' Rafalski said. ''Then I saw space and got behind Sergei Zubov.''</p>
        <p>Before the outburst, Martin Brodeur and the penalty killers kept the Devils in the game. Brodeur had repelled three Dallas power plays before Joe Nieuwendyk scored his first goal in the series to open the scoring with 1:58 left in the second period. Before tonight, the Stars had won seven games in the playoffs in which Nieuwendyk had a point in a game.</p>
        <p>Nieuwendyk held his ground between Stevens and Scott Niedermayer and swept the puck past Brodeur after a shot from the left by Darryl Sydor.</p>
        <p>Nieuwendyk's goal was only the fifth in 60 manpower advantages against the Devils, who have been the best team in the playoffs killing penalties.</p>
        <p>The Devils were presented with four manpower advantages themselves, but they they failed to sustain any consistent pressure against Belfour. Patrik Elias got so upset at himself for failing to get the puck to Jason Arnott at one point that he banged his stick against the boards in front of the Devils' bench.</p>
        <p>Arnott's line with Elias and Petr Sykora that had dominated in the two victories in the first three games did little in this game. The Stars changed strategy by using their checking line against them this time and Arnott left with about eight minutes left in the game after he was hit in the face by Derian Hatcher. Barry Fisher, the team physician for the Devils, said that Arnott had not suffered a concussion and that he would play in Game 5 Thursday.</p>
        <p>For one night, Arnott, Sykora and Elias -- who scored 6 of the Devils' 13 goals -- were quiet. Fortunately for the Devils, the youngsters came through to put the club within one victory of winning the Stanley Cup.</p>
