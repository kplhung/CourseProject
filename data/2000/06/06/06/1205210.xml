        <p>Seeking to play a much bigger role in trading on the Nasdaq stock market, Merrill Lynch &amp; Company is in serious discussions to buy Herzog Heine Geduld Inc. for nearly $1 billion, according to people close to the companies.</p>

        <p>Seeking to play a much bigger role in trading on the Nasdaq stock market, Merrill Lynch &amp; Company is in serious discussions to buy Herzog Heine Geduld Inc. for nearly $1 billion, according to people close to the companies.</p>
        <p>In a deal that could be announced as soon as today, Merrill is negotiating to use its stock to buy Herzog, a private company based in Jersey City that serves as an intermediary, or market maker, between buyers and sellers of Nasdaq stocks. Herzog is the third-biggest market maker in Nasdaq stocks and Merrill has been plotting lately to expand its market-making business.</p>
        <p>Representatives of Merrill and of Herzog declined to comment on the matter after it was reported yesterday by the Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
        <p>Shares of the Knight Trading Group, the No. 1 market maker with 18 percent of Nasdaq trades, fell 13 percent yesterday, to $30.9375, on concerns that an aggressive move by Merrill would divert some of the flow of trades that go from Merrill and other brokerage firms to Knight.</p>
        <p>Buying Herzog, which handles about 9 percent of Nasdaq trades, would represent a reversal for Merrill in a couple of ways: the firm has sharply cut back its Nasdaq trading business in the last few years and its executives have been reluctant to make any big acquisitions after its last buying binge depressed its stock price.</p>
        <p>On the Nasdaq market, many firms can make a market in a particular stock, by standing ready to buy shares from willing sellers or sell shares to buyers. Market makers keep the difference between what they pay sellers and what they receive from buyers, a difference known as the spread.</p>
        <p>Spreads on Nasdaq trading shrank after the National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the Nasdaq market, put in place new rules in the wake of lawsuits that contended that market makers colluded to keep spreads unjustifiably high. The investigation caused by those suits culminated in a $1 billion settlement paid by dozens of Wall Street firms, including Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>With their trading profits drying up, some big firms chose to make markets only in the most popular Nasdaq stocks, leaving thousands of others to traditional market-making firms like Herzog. Some technology-based newcomers, like Knight, formerly Knight-Trimark, stepped in to the void and showed that market making remained a profitable business. In recent weeks, Merrill, the No. 6 market maker, has been telling traders that it planned to quadruple the number of stocks in which it makes a market to about 2,000 from about 550. Merrill had planned to set up a Nasdaq trading site in Jersey City that would serve as its beefed-up operation.</p>
        <p>Analysts were divided on whether buying Herzog was a smart move for Merrill.</p>
        <p>''When better to buy a Nasdaq market maker than after a Nasdaq crash?'' said Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs.</p>
        <p>He said Merrill appeared to be copying a model that has worked well for its rival discount brokerage firm, Charles Schwab.</p>
        <p>Schwab routes many of its customers' Nasdaq stock trades to its own Jersey City-based market-making operation in a practice known as internalization that is becoming a buzzword on Wall Street. Keeping trades in-house gives the firm more information about which way stock prices are headed, data that it can use to trade for its own account.</p>
        <p>Schwab, the No. 2 market maker with 12 percent of Nasdaq trades, has been a notable dissenter to proposals to create a central book of all existing orders to buy and sell Nasdaq stocks. Merrill and other big Wall Street firms had supported such a change, but lately that support has been weakening.</p>
        <p>''Maybe Merrill has a clear idea of where market reform is going,'' Mr. Strauss said.</p>
        <p>Amy Butte, a Bear, Stearns analyst, said that buying Herzog would make Merrill a big market maker quickly. ''In making this acquisition, they would look a lot more like Schwab,'' she said. But, she added, market makers' profits are threatened again by the Securities and Exchange Commission's plan to change the structure of the United States stock markets.</p>
        <p>For several months, Ms. Butte has recommended against buying Knight stock, in part, because she believes that the profits of pure market makers are likely to be squeezed. Based on the price Herzog reportedly would fetch, she said, Knight's stock price is much too high.</p>
