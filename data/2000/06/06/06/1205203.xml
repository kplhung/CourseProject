        <p>The Republican National Committee and the party's Senate and House campaign committees raised $86,365,915 in soft money -- the large, unregulated donations from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals -- compared with $44,701,408 in the 1995-96 period. For their Democratic counterparts, the total was $77,027,027, compared with $39,651,236 in 1995-96.</p>

        <p>Campaign fund-raising continued to reach new highs as both parties almost doubled the soft-money totals raised four years ago, in the last presidential year, and House and Senate candidates also set records in the 15 months that ended March 31, the Federal Election Commission reported today.</p>
        <p>The Republican National Committee and the party's Senate and House campaign committees raised $86,365,915 in soft money -- the large, unregulated donations from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals -- compared with $44,701,408 in the 1995-96 period. For their Democratic counterparts, the total was $77,027,027, compared with $39,651,236 in 1995-96.</p>
        <p>For both parties, the sharpest increases came for the Congressional fund-raising committees. While the Republican National Committee's total of $41,924,424 in soft money was up 38 percent, the National Republican Senatorial Committee's $17,616,000 was up 101 percent, and the National Republican Congressional Committee's $27,476,942 was a 183 percent increase.</p>
        <p>But no Republican Committee approached the growth rate of the Democratic Senate and House committees, which are aggressively raising unrestricted donations in a drive to regain control of the Congress.</p>
        <p>The Democratic Senate Campaign Committee raised $16,531,493 in soft money, up a staggering 1,037 percent since 1995-96. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's take rose only half as fast, up 540 percent to $21,901,681. In contrast, the $39,911,652 raised by the Democratic National Committee was only a 14 percent increase in four years.</p>
        <p>In 1996, rising soft-money contributions to the political parties sparked controversy. The Democratic National Committee returned millions of dollars in suspect soft money that came from overseas donors or from individuals who may not have contributed their own money. Both parties used soft money for so-called issue advertising to promote their presidential candidates. This election, with the explosion of soft money, these unrestricted donations will play an even bigger role. Already, Democrats have blasted Republicans for their big soft-money contributions from tobacco companies and the National Rifle Association, while the Republicans have criticized Democrats for being dependent on large, soft-money checks from trial lawyers.</p>
        <p>In ''hard money'' donations to party organizations, which are limited to  $20,000 in a calendar year from individuals and $15,000 from political action committees, there were only modest changes from 1995-96. The three Democratic committees raised $103,955,600, up 1 percent. The Republicans raised $179,315,144, down 1 percent.</p>
        <p>The two parties were also about even in hard cash on hand -- an important detail because soft money cannot be used by itself but must be combined with varying fractions of hard money in different states to buy television advertisements, its main use these days. Republicans had $32,221,149 on hand. Democrats had $31,476,712.</p>
        <p>But when it came to individual candidates in House races, especially races where no incumbent is running and seats are most likely to change parties, Republicans held an important advantage. In open seats, their candidates had raised an average of $165,775. Democrats in those seats had raised an average of $75,820.</p>
        <p>Of the top 30 fund-raisers among Senate candidates, 19 were Republicans. The overall leader was Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City, who withdrew from the race last month. He reported raising $19,285,647, compared with $12,803,284 for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the New York Democratic nominee. She was second. Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Long Island Republican who became his party's nominee after Mr. Giuliani dropped out, but who was still a House candidate on March 31, was sixth among House candidates, with $2,069,945 raised, but first in cash on hand, with $3,497,829.</p>
