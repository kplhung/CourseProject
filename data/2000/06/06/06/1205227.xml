        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio failed last night to win the nomination of the Independence Party, the state wing of the Reform Party. The development could cost him votes by splitting support among the candidates opposed to Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Senate election.</p>
        <p>Two candidates within the Independence Party received the most votes at its nominating convention in Albany, and the party authorized a primary on Sept. 12 to determine which one would be listed on its ballot. The party is torn by the kind of infighting and factionalism that its national organization is facing.</p>
        <p>The top vote-getter, Jeff Graham, a radio talk show host who was mayor of Watertown for two terms, said he decided to run only after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani dropped out of the race last month. Mr. Graham, who said he had believed that Mr. Giuliani was a sure bet for the Independence Party nomination, received 63 percent of the vote from  the party's 266 delegates.</p>
        <p>He faces Jeff Beller of Westerlo, near Albany, the president of an advocacy group for alternative fuels, who received 32 percent.</p>
        <p>In a tight race, the third-party lines in New York State are considered crucial. The Independence line can draw more than 100,000 voters. Mr. Lazio won the Conservative Party endorsement and Mrs. Clinton the Liberal Party endorsement last weekend.</p>
        <p>In the week since his nomination as the Republican candidate, Mr. Lazio has faced sticky questions about a possible association with the Independence Party because Patrick J. Buchanan, who has been accused of making anti-Semitic remarks, stands a good chance of winning the presidential nomination of the Reform Party. That means Mr. Lazio's name would have been on the same ticket, had he received the nomination yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who had said that Mr. Buchanan was divisive, insisted late last month that he would still accept the nomination while expressing clear support for George W. Bush, the Republican candidate for president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic nominee, appeared before the Independence Party last month and denounced Mr. Buchanan and refused any support from it.</p>
        <p>Officials for the Lazio campaign noted the presence of a number of Democratic Party operatives at the Independence Party convention, leading some to conclude that Mrs. Clinton's surrogates had helped engineer Mr. Lazio's loss so that her opposition would be divided.</p>
        <p>Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, acknowledged the presence of the aides but would not comment on what, if any, active role they played. ''They were observing,'' he said. ''They were observing the process. They were watching democracy in action.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham said he believed that Mr. Lazio's poor showing had less to do with his comments about Mr. Buchanan than his association with Jack Essenberg, the Independence Party's former chairman, who gave up his position last week after a court fight that resulted in Lenora Fulani, an avowed Marxist, and Frank M. MacKay, wresting control of the party. The two have aligned themselves with Mr. Buchanan. Mr. Graham, who is backed by Mr. MacKay, said there was a perception among delegates that Mr. Lazio was cultivating support from Mr. Essenberg.</p>
        <p>''Lazio was negotiating through Essenberg, and that didn't play well with the state committee,'' said Sarah Lyons, a party spokeswoman. ''He didn't have the sense to realize he was dealing with the wrong person.''</p>
        <p>Bryan Flood, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, said he was not aware of contacts made by Mr. Lazio with the party. ''He respects the party's process,'' Mr. Flood said. ''It was the delegates' decision, and what they decide to do is not have any major-party involvement. We respect that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio finished fourth, with 1.3 percent of the vote, behind Abe Hirschfeld, the eccentric Manhattan real estate developer and perennial candidate for public office, who won 3 percent of the delegates' votes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides played down the turn of events yesterday, saying he had not aggressively sought the nomination, though he would have welcomed it. Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat who also ran on the Independence Party line in 1998, received 109,000 votes from the party in his 10-percentage-point victory over Alfonse M. D'Amato in 1998. There are about 170,000 people enrolled in the Independence Party.</p>
        <p>In addition to running against Mr. Lazio and a candidate from the Independence Party, Mrs. Clinton, who is often viewed as the front-runner because of her stature and standing in the polls, is also expected to face opposition from the Right to Life Party. The party is holding a primary on Sept. 12 between Louis Wein, its candidate for governor in 1990, and John Adofope, a telephone company engineer.</p>
        <p>Independence Party officials said their candidate would campaign on a platform similar to that of the national Reform Party, which supports changes intended to make politics more accessible to everyday people, like same-day voter registration and a ban on unregulated financial contributions to political parties. The Reform Party was founded by Ross Perot.</p>
