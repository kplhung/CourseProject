        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your report about the controversy between the actor Patrick Stewart and the producers of my play ''The Ride Down Mount Morgan'' on Broadway (Arts pages, May 31) says some have suggested that Mr. Stewart's motive in speaking directly to the audience may have been his calculation that the publicity would enhance his Tony possibilities.</p>
        <p>How an actor could calculate that a conflict with his producers could somehow bring him closer to a Tony -- which it obviously didn't -- is one of those mysteries that this writer fails to wrap his mind around. I would think that the real question is what the circumstances were that drove a peaceable actor to such an extreme.</p>
