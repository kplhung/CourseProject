        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright arrived here today for her first visit in six months, seeking to inject a sense of urgency into the long-running Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and to lay the foundation for a three-way retreat-style summit meeting.</p>
        <p>''The moment of truth is fast approaching in the pursuit of the Israeli-Palestinian peace,'' Dr. Albright said tonight. ''If the Israelis and the Palestinians are willing to accept that neither can get 100 percent of what they want, and that each side must address the other in a spirit of partnership, then they will succeed.''</p>
        <p>In keeping with President Clinton's eagerness to propel the parties toward a final peace accord during his waning months in office, Dr. Albright, who began her visit by meeting with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, hopes to imbue both sides with a spirit of compromise realistic enough to get them to the endgame of their long conflict.</p>
        <p>But whether the Israelis and the Palestinians, who remain far apart on every crucial issue, can come together on any of them quickly enough remains to be seen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat have not yet made clear if they are willing to stare down domestic opponents and make deep concessions on emotional issues like the fate of Jerusalem and the Palestinian refugees.</p>
        <p>And in the end, American officials say, it comes down to whether Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat consider the constellation of their determination, their political strength and their chemistry sufficient to seize what all are calling a historic opportunity.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright is scheduled to meet with Mr. Arafat on Tuesday in the West Bank city of Ramallah, and to return to Mr. Barak in the evening. Mr. Arafat is then supposed to travel to Washington to see President Clinton, who emerged from a meeting with Mr. Barak in Lisbon last week with the optimistic pronouncement that an agreement was ''within view.''</p>
        <p>American mediators are trying to parse each side's demands and determine ''what really is critical to them as opposed to what may be desirable,'' a senior administration official said.</p>
        <p>After her visit here, Dr. Albright is to go to Cairo on Wednesday for talks with Syrian's foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara.</p>
        <p>That would be the first high-level Syrian-American meeting since President Clinton's failed meeting with President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva in March, and it raises the prospect that the moribund Israeli-Syrian peace track could be resuscitated.</p>
        <p>That would be bad news for Mr. Arafat. Last December, during Dr. Albright's last trip here, President Clinton announced the revival of Israeli-Syrian talks, which effectively shut down Israel's talks with the Palestinians for months, until the negotiations with Syria derailed.</p>
        <p>In Israel there is the palpable sense -- an anxiety for the right wing -- that the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are about to enter the final round. Many of Mr. Barak's ministers sent him a letter tonight demanding that he convene an urgent meeting of the security cabinet to let them know what was really happening in the talks.</p>
        <p>And before he met with Dr. Albright tonight in his office and then over dinner at his residence, Mr. Barak survived the latest in a series of parliamentary no-confidence resolutions, this one based on the concessions he is presumed to be making to the Palestinians. The resolution was voted down, 38 to 33, with 13 abstentions.</p>
