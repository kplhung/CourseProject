        <p>Orlando Cabrera made the last out in David Cone's perfect game last July and was ecstatic afterward, feeling he had played a part in history, saying it ranked among the greatest moments of his career.</p>
        <p>But when Cabrera eventually reflects on his career, that weak pop-up to third base at Yankee Stadium may rank a few notches below the game-winning homer he slammed off Cone here tonight.</p>
        <p>Cabrera's three-run homer in the sixth inning snapped a tie and all but finished Cone as Montreal (31-23) dumped the Yankees, 6-4. The Yankees (30-23) stranded 13 runners on base, with a base-running mistake costing them an early run. They have left 48 runners on base over their last four games.</p>
        <p>Cone, who started on short notice because Ramiro Mendoza had a stiff shoulder, was pounded for six runs in six innings. His record is 1-6, his earned run average 6.49. He allowed 34 hits with runners in scoring position during the entire 1999 season, and he has surrendered 23 this year.</p>
        <p>''The only thing I can do is forget about the numbers,'' he said. ''I've got to trick myself into forgetting about the numbers. I just have to concede I had a terrible start, and start over. The team needs me, and all that really matters is what happens from here on out.''</p>
        <p>He briefly considered a career in journalism before opting for a more lucrative profession, but Cone served in the role of reporter today, after accompanying Mendoza on the team bus to Olympic Stadium. Mendoza is reserved and needs to be drawn out, and what Cone ascertained in their conversation was that his teammate's right shoulder felt stiff.</p>
        <p>Cone walked into the office of Manager Joe Torre, delivered the news about Mendoza and volunteered to pitch in his place. ''Strap it on and go,'' Cone said minutes later, walking through the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>Cone wanted to change his approach, slow his delivery -- heck, change anything. He told Jorge Posada he would not shake off any of the catcher's signs, that Posada would call the game and Cone would follow his lead.</p>
        <p>The Expos hit him immediately. With Montreal down by 2-0 in the bottom of the first, Rondell White doubled before Cone hung a split-finger fastball to Vladimir Guerrero. Montreal's right fielder attacked the ball ferociously, seemingly rising out of his shoes as he swung viciously. Estimated distance: 436 feet.</p>
        <p>Cone had a good tailing fastball, something he has rarely featured this year, but he fell behind in the count continually, throwing a ball with his first pitch to 14 of Montreal's first 19 batters. The count was 2-0 when Lee Stevens singled in the third inning to score Guerrero, who had doubled, and tie the score, 3-3.</p>
        <p>The Yankees could have had at least one more run in the first inning. Scott Brosius grounded a two-out single with the bases loaded, Bernie Williams trotting home with one run, Tino Martinez rounding third. But Posada raced for third and was thrown out by center fielder Peter Bergeron; because the tag was applied an instant before Martinez ambled across home, the run didn't count. Posada made the right play in trying to draw a throw, Torre said afterward, and a mistake in being tagged out before the run scored.</p>
        <p>It was the first of many scoring chances blown by the Yankees, who loaded the bases in the third and couldn't score, left one runner in scoring position in the fourth and stranded two more in the sixth.</p>
        <p>Cone surrendered a single and hit a batter with one out in the sixth, and Cabrera came to bat. He had no chance against Cone's swerving slider last July, something he has probably been reminded of dozens of times if he watches television; there is that recurrent image of Cabrera popping up and Cone dropping to his knees as Brosius makes the final catch.</p>
        <p>But Cone's slider is not sharp these days, and when he fell behind in the count by 2-0 to Cabrera, his pitch selection was limited. Posada called for a fastball, Cone threw it and Cabrera crushed it, pausing as he watched the ball rise toward left field, flipping his bat, his eyes darting for an instant in Cone's direction. Later, he felt stupid for the antics. ''I want to say I'm sorry for looking at the ball too much,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Torre said the Yankees' trainers did not think Mendoza's injury was serious, that he might miss the next few days -- a situation that will be noted by the teams following him. Scouts helping to prepare possible trades for Mendoza -- including Kansas City's (Johnny Damon), Cincinnati's (Dmitri Young) and Houston's (Moises Alou) -- have been trailing the right-hander.</p>
        <p>Mendoza's absence will jumble the Yankees' pitching rotation. Cone was supposed to pitch Tuesday, and must be replaced. Ted Lilly, one of the pitchers acquired from Montreal in the Hideki Irabu deal, was held back from his scheduled start this evening for Class AAA Columbus; the Yankees could promote him, or perhaps start Allen Watson or Todd Erdos.</p>
        <p>Orlando Hernandez is scheduled to pitch here Wednesday, which means that Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Cone could be in line to start against the Mets at Yankee Stadium this weekend.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Catcher DAVID PARRISH, son of the longtime catcher LANCE PARRISH, turned down a chance to sign with the Yankees in 1997 as a 10th-round draft choice and regretted it. But he will get another chance. The Yankees drafted him in the first round Monday out of the University of Michigan. His father, who will represent his son in contract talks, took the call from the Yankees. ''He was jumping through the phone, he was so excited,'' Lance Parrish said. . . . The Yankees played without CHUCK KNOBLAUCH (bruised wrist), who is day to day. . . . PAUL O'NEILL and Manager JOE TORRE argued with Umpire RICH RIEKER in the fourth, after Rieker ruled that O'Neill did not foul a ball off his right big toe and called him out on a ground ball. O'Neill's toe was bloody, his toenail in fragments. ''I'm going to lose my big toenail,'' he said. ''I'm going to send it to him.''</p>
