        <p>For anyone with professional baseball as his goal, the San Diego area is apparently the place to live. Holding their annual draft of amateur players yesterday, major league teams selected six players from that area, including two from the same high school, in the first round.</p>
        <p>Adrian Gonzalez, a left-handed-hitting first baseman, was the No. 1 pick in the draft, chosen by the Florida Marlins, and the first of the five San Diego players taken.</p>
        <p>Gonzalez, who batted .645 and drove in 34 runs in 76 at-bats this season, was given a $3 million signing bonus. Some baseball people speculated that the Marlins had planned to take Scott Heard, a catcher from Rancho Bernardo High School in San Diego, but that Heard rejected their bonus offer.</p>
        <p>Heard went much lower than expected. The Texas Rangers made him the 25th player selected. His batterymate, Matt Wheatland, a right-hander, was the eighth player drafted, going to the Detroit Tigers. It marked the third time in the 35-year history of the draft that high school teammates were selected in the first round.</p>
        <p>Also selected in the first round were Adam Johnson, a right-hander from San Diego and California State University at Fullerton, taken as the second pick by Minnesota; Shaun Boyd, a second baseman from a San Diego suburb, taken as the 13th player by St. Louis; and Robert Stiehl, a catcher, chosen as the 27th player by Houston.</p>
        <p>Gonzalez said having so many good players and teams in the area was beneficial.''You always look in paper to see how they're doing, and you want to do better than them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' first-round selection, David Parrish, son of Lance, the former Detroit catcher, was one of several sons of former major leaguers drafted. The group also included shortstop Aaron Herr, son of Tom, by Atlanta in the ''sandwich'' free-agent compensation round between the first and second rounds; third baseman Lance Niekro, son of Joe, by San Francisco in the second round; pitcher Kyle Gross, son of Wayne, by the Giants in the fifth round; and pitcher Jason Fingers, son of Rollie, by Kansas City in the 10th round.</p>
