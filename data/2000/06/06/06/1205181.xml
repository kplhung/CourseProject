        <p>For the first time in history, two Russian men are in the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam event.</p>
        <p>Through drizzle and delays on another rainy day at Roland Garros, Marat Safin, a 20-year-old with a whippet's frame, a huge serve and one of the most explosive two-handed backhands in history, eliminated Cedric Pioline, 6-4, 1-6, 6-3, 7-5, to reach the final eight in a Grand Slam event for the first time in his career.</p>
        <p>Safin's occasional mentor, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, reached the final eight on Sunday and will face Gustavo Kuerten in his quarterfinal.</p>
        <p>But the happiest Russian now appears to be Andrei Chesnokov, Safin's coach, who was grinning and flashing the thumbs-up signal to his young pupil.</p>
        <p>Safin, who has won 23 of his last 26 matches, winning tournaments in Barcelona and Mallorca, parted ways with his longtime Spanish coach, Rafael Menusa, and hired Chesnokov on a trial basis during the Barcelona tournament. At that stage, Safin was 5-11.</p>
        <p>Chesnokov, a French Open semifinalist in 1989, has helped Safin regain his appetite for the game. He had never coached anyone formally, but Safin's enormous gift for the game and for handling the big occasion has been clear since he qualified here as a teenager in 1998 and beat Andre Agassi, a future champion, and Kuerten, the defending champion, on his way to the fourth round.</p>
        <p>It appeared that Safin would soon reach the top of the sport, but he also has a temper and a tendency to overhit instead of overanalyze.</p>
        <p>Chesnokov has helped him regain a measure of control and talked him through the two-hour rain delay that interrupted the third set today. But Safin is still no stoic.</p>
        <p>Serving in the mist at 4-5 in the fourth set with the French crowd cheering Pioline's every flourish, Safin missed a forehand passing shot to fall behind by 0-40 and then wheeled and smashed his racket onto the clay. ''I was already thinking about the fifth set,'' Safin said.</p>
        <p>But he proceeded to win the next three points as Pioline, who had attacked earlier in the game, suddenly stopped pushing forward.</p>
        <p>In all, Safin saved four set points before knocking away a backhand volley to get back to 5-5. Visibly deflated, Pioline lost his serve in the next game on a double fault and then failed to capitalize on Safin's inability to get his own first serve in play.</p>
        <p>Magnus Norman joined Safin in the final eight by defeating last year's surprise finalist Andrei Medvedev, 6-0, 6-4, 6-2.</p>
        <p>The day's two other fourth-round matches were suspended because of darkness with Franco Squillari of Argentina leading Younes el-Aynaoui of Morocco, 6-4, 6-1, 3-3, and Alberto Costa of Spain leading Lleyton Hewitt of Australia, 6-3, 4-4.</p>
