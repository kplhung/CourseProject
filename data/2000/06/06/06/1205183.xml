        <p>After three years of Triple Crown suspense, Belmont Park was trying to pick up the pieces from its shattered cast for the Belmont Stakes yesterday. But it was finding few signs of a stampede by quality horses to replace the departed winners of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness.</p>
        <p>It was also having trouble finding words to express its dismay at not having a horse with a shot at the Triple Crown this year after three straight blockbuster years when a horse did, before crowds that reached a record of 85,818 last year.</p>
        <p>''Like anybody, we are disappointed with the turn of events that have cost us the Derby and Preakness winners,'' said Terry Meyocks, president of the New York Racing Association. ''But the well-being of the horses comes first. However, our expectations are still high. The Belmont Stakes is a New York event.''</p>
        <p>Less than two weeks after the withdrawal of Red Bullet, who won the Preakness, the race was dealt a kind of coup de grace on Sunday by the withdrawal of Fusaichi Pegasus, who won the Kentucky Derby and ran second in the Preakness. It lost Red Bullet when his owner decided the colt needed more time between races. Then Fusaichi Pegasus was withdrawn by his trainer, Neil Drysdale, after the colt sustained a small cut on his right front hoof in his stall. Neither horse had a shot at the Triple Crown, of course, but a rematch would have at least made the Belmont highly anticipated. And now, some of that anticipation is gone.</p>
        <p>Most of the trainers at Belmont Park reacted diplomatically to the double blow, but Carl Nafzger announced from Churchill Downs that Unshaded, who ran second to Postponed in the Peter Pan, would now be entered in the Belmont. Not only that, but the horse's owner, James Tafel, will also pay the $100,000 supplemental fee required because the colt was not nominated to the Triple Crown. Earlier, Nafzger had said that Unshaded would not run unless the race ''fell apart.''</p>
        <p>The trainer announced the switch in plans after Unshaded was timed in one minute flat for five furlongs in a workout at Churchill Downs, with Nafzger terming it ''a very professional work.''</p>
        <p>''Of course, when Fusaichi Pegasus came out of the race,'' he said, ''that had something to do with it. But it was the work that made the difference.''</p>
        <p>Another horse at Churchill Downs was also committed to the Belmont after a solid workout. D. Wayne Lukas, who had listed Commendable as a possible starter, made it definite after the colt worked six furlongs in 1:134/5.</p>
        <p>''It was an excellent work,'' Lukas said from his barn at Santa Anita. ''We were leaning toward running anyway, but we wanted to get that last work into him.''</p>
        <p>Normally, the defection of two top players would be an open invitation to lesser horses to enter a major race. But it was difficult to find horses who could run a mile and a half and who were ready to try it this Saturday. Entries must be filed by tomorrow, so it appeared likely that the absence of Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet would favor the contenders already committed to the race. A field of 12 is expected.</p>
        <p>John Kimmel, the trainer of Wheelaway, who ran fifth in the Derby, skipped the Preakness and is now set for the Belmont, reacted with something of an understatement, saying, ''I look at it as one less horse to beat.''</p>
        <p>Scotty Schulhofer, the trainer of Postponed, acknowledged some sense of relief that Fusaichi Pegasus would not be running.</p>
        <p>''I feel very bad for Neil Drysdale,'' he said. ''But I'm not going to say that I'm not happy the horse isn't running, because I am. It makes the race easier for the rest of us.''</p>
        <p>Did the handlers of Red Bullet have second thoughts now?</p>
        <p>''Fusaichi Pegasus had nothing to do with it,'' said Joe Orseno, who trains Red Bullet for Frank Stronach. ''We weren't going in the Belmont before, and we're not going after.''</p>
        <p>Even though New York may have been spoiled by three straight years when the Triple Crown was within the grasp of a 3-year-old colt running in the Belmont, racing officials were hoping that there might be some carry-over effect and that the public would show up in force this Saturday.</p>
        <p>''In the decade of the 90's, in the years before the Triple Crown went on the line, we had crowds of 37,171 on Belmont Day in 1995 and 40,797 on Belmont day in 1996,'' said Bill Nader, N.Y.R.A.'s director of broadcast communications and promotions. ''Then, suddenly, we had three years in a row when a horse came in here after winning the Derby and Preakness, and the crowds doubled.</p>
        <p>''Imagine if Pegasus had come in here after winning the Derby and Preakness, and for the fourth straight year, racing history went on the line. We might have had 90,000 people at the track next Saturday, maybe even 100,000.''</p>
