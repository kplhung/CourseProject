        <p>The third and final criminal trial stemming from the attack on Abner Louima opened yesterday as prosecutors asserted that a police officer had lied to federal investigators about what he saw inside in a Brooklyn station house the night Mr. Louima was brutally assaulted there nearly three years ago.</p>
        <p>The officer, Francisco Rosario, told ''one false story after another'' about what he knew of the attack on Mr. Louima, a Haitian immigrant who was sodomized with a broken broomstick inside the station house in August 1997, said Alan Vinegrad, the chief prosecutor in the case.</p>

        <p>The third and final criminal trial stemming from the attack on Abner Louima opened yesterday as prosecutors asserted that a police officer had lied to federal investigators about what he saw inside in a Brooklyn station house the night Mr. Louima was brutally assaulted there nearly three years ago.</p>
        <p>The officer, Francisco Rosario, told ''one false story after another'' about what he knew of the attack on Mr. Louima, a Haitian immigrant who was sodomized with a broken broomstick inside the station house in August 1997, said Alan Vinegrad, the chief prosecutor in the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vinegrad told the jury in Federal District Court in Brooklyn that Officer Rosario first lied to federal agents in September 1997 by saying he was not inside the 70th Precinct station house during the attack and its aftermath. Two months later, after he admitted that he had been there, Officer Rosario lied again about which officer led Mr. Louima, moaning and with his pants down around his knees, into the station house's cell area, Mr. Vinegrad said.</p>
        <p>The government contends that the officer who escorted Mr. Louima into the cell was Justin A. Volpe, who is now serving 30 years after pleading guilty to committing the attack. Another officer, Charles Schwarz, was convicted last June of helping Mr. Volpe torture Mr. Louima and was found guilty anew in March of conspiring with two accomplices -- Officers Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese -- to cover up the assault.</p>
        <p>Officer Rosario, 35, was never charged in the attack and, in fact, was never even assigned to the 70th Precinct. He was a member of the department's Street Crime Unit who happened to be inside the station house that night doing the paperwork for a prisoner. His partner, Officer Rolando Aleman, pleaded guilty in April to virtually the same charges that Officer Rosario is now fighting.</p>
        <p>The government contends that Officer Rosario tried to extricate himself by claiming that he was outside the station house when the assault occurred, ''getting a breath of fresh air,'' as Mr. Vinegrad put it. Mr. Vinegrad also argued that Officer Rosario had obscured ''the search for the truth'' by saying he had seen Officer Bruder -- and not Mr. Volpe -- lead Mr. Louima into the cell room moments after the attack.</p>
        <p>Richard Levitt, the officer's lawyer, began his own opening statement by admitting that his client had made a mistake when he said he was not there when Mr. Louima was tortured. But Mr. Levitt said that while that was ethically questionable, it did not rise to the level of a crime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levitt argued that when Officer Rosario finally told the authorities he had seen Mr. Louima in Officer Bruder's custody, he was truthfully reporting what he remembered. Officer Rosario was ''guilt-ridden'' at having misled the authorities, Mr. Levitt said, and is now on trial simply because his version of the truth does not jibe with the government's.</p>
