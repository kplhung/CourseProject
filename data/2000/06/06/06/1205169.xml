        <p>And Baby Makes Good Copy</p>
        <p>While many women may have a hard time seeing pregnancy as a chance to take hold of new fashion opportunities, the British model Stella Tennant felt no such limitations. Ms. Tennant, a granddaughter of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, has modeled for Burberry, the unstoppably trendy label of her homeland, since 1997. That she was five months pregnant at the time of the Burberry Fall 2000 show in London last February did not deter her from modeling an evening gown. And that she was seven months pregnant when it came time to shoot next fall's advertising campaign did not frighten her employers either.</p>

        <p>And Baby Makes Good Copy</p>
        <p>While many women may have a hard time seeing pregnancy as a chance to take hold of new fashion opportunities, the British model Stella Tennant felt no such limitations. Ms. Tennant, a granddaughter of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, has modeled for Burberry, the unstoppably trendy label of her homeland, since 1997. That she was five months pregnant at the time of the Burberry Fall 2000 show in London last February did not deter her from modeling an evening gown. And that she was seven months pregnant when it came time to shoot next fall's advertising campaign did not frighten her employers either.</p>
        <p>Rather than send her home for some rest, Burberry had the photographer Mario Testino shoot Ms. Tennant, puffed belly and all, in trench coats and miniskirts, at her family home, Glen House, in the Scottish highlands.</p>
        <p>A recent Burberry campaign featured Kate Moss slicing into a wedding cake. So, Ms. Tennant with child seemed like a logical next step. Rose Marie Bravo, Burberry's president, said: ''We're very much about family relationships. All the campaigns have been weddings, dog shows. Why not shoot her as she is?''</p>
        <p>In fact, why not give the expectant mother some shelf space? Ms. Tennant recently introduced a line of babies' knitwear (made in Scotland) she designed, at Burberry.</p>
        <p>Married to the fashion photographer David Lasnet, Ms. Tennant gave birth Last Friday to an eight-pound daughter, Cecily, the couple's second child.</p>
        <p>Out of Brooklyn</p>
        <p>For 52 years, Jimmy's has occupied two worlds: the one of dresses and suits that cost as much as furniture, and the more banal reality of Kings Highway in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, where it's located. There, one will find Gucci, Fendi and John Galliano, if not the sort of shoppers who look as though they stepped out of ''Sex and the City.''</p>
        <p>''We don't get too many Manhattan people driving in,'' Dominick Lepore said recently. Mr. Lepore owns the store with his wife, Betsy, the daughter of its founder. ''There are affluent sections and affluent people in Brooklyn,'' he added.</p>
        <p>And more in the Hamptons. Five years ago, Jimmy's opened a Westhampton branch, and about 10 days ago, an East Hampton one. ''The people from East don't drive west and the people from West don't drive east,'' he observed.</p>
        <p>For the rest of the summer the stores' owners will be holding trunk shows on Saturdays and Sundays -- for Marc Jacobs, Velasco Andersson and others -- at both Long Island locations.</p>
        <p>Over the last weekend, Craig Natiello presented his fall 2000 line for Halston at the East Hampton shop. ''Dominick and Betsy really know their customer in that specialty-store, Martha kind of way,'' Mr. Natiello said, referring to the intimate Park Avenue boutique Martha, now closed.</p>
        <p>Moonlighting Nightclub</p>
        <p>There is no reason why a nightclub shouldn't work overtime during daylight hours. If it looks like Centro-Fly, the West 21st Street club that suggests a ''Laugh-In'' set crossed with a Finnish airport terminal, the fashion photographers will come. Since its debut in December, the club has opened its doors to Steven Meisel, who shot two covers for Italian Vogue there. German Elle and Australian Vogue followed, and the style-obsessed Mary J. Blige recently made a music video in the 11,000-square-foot space. The less glamorous have come, too: Nordstrom recently photographed an upcoming catalog at the Op Art-inspired club. This week, Victoria's Secret will shoot parts of its next catalog there as well.</p>
        <p>''It's turned into its own cottage industry,'' said Tom Sisk, the club's co-owner, who now has someone managing the logistics of photo shoots.</p>
        <p>''We turn down as many as we're offered,'' Mr. Sisk said of the projects he is pitched. The reasons for rejections break down to ''bad products, bad fashion.'' Mr. Sisk then leaped, unsolicited, into an explanation of why he allowed the middle-of-the-road Nordstrom to take pictures in his haven of cool. ''The Nordstrom's catalog we decided to accept,'' he said. ''We decided to accept that because the theme was music.''</p>
