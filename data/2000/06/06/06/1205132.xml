        <p>Dr. Susie Orbach -- the therapist who treated Diana, Princess of Wales, for her eating disorders; the founder of the Women's Therapy Center of London; a former columnist for The Guardian; a visiting professor at the London School of Economics; and the author of 1978 best-seller ''Fat is a Feminist Issue'' -- is, aside from Sigmund Freud, probably the most famous psychotherapist to have ever set up couch in Britain.</p>
        <p>On a recent visit to New York, Dr. Orbach, 53, talked about her eighth book, ''The Impossibility of Sex: Stories of the Intimate Relationship Between Therapist and Patient'' (Scribner).</p>
        <p>Q.: In ''The Impossibility of Sex,'' you own up to a great emotional involvement with your patients. Is this usual within your profession?</p>
        <p>A.: Entirely usual. But analysts have a lot of different methods for dealing with it. Depending on their school, they'll say, ''this is about my personal engagement.''</p>
        <p>Or, ''this is what is done to me by the patient and it has nothing to do with me.''  Or, ''this patient is disturbing me, I'll have to send him to another therapist.'' At the end of the day, though, we know there are no human relationships where we do not disturb one another. And that's true of the analytic relationship, too.</p>
        <p>Q.: In the book, you admit to feeling sexually stimulated by a patient named Adam, who kept trying to seduce you. Are you telling secrets out of school?</p>
        <p>A.: I don't think there's any shame about that. The point is, How does one respond to the various emotional invitations of one's patients? Every person has an idiom. Some patients invite me in with their intellect. This particular man was a compulsive fornicator and he had no other way to maintain a relationship unless he was involved in seduction. To get into his heart and head, a piece of me had to surrender to that seduction to understand what that was about for him and to understand how incredibly painful, barren and problematic it was.</p>
        <p>Q.: One gets the feeling you see psychoanalyst and patient as a kind of emotional couple.  A.: I see patient and therapist working together, creating a relationship in which you are lifting the impediments to intimacy. And you're often doing that within the relationship you have together. So in that sense you are a couple. But it's a very specialized type of couple -- just like therapy is a very specialized type of relationship.</p>
        <p>Q.: The Princess of Wales went to you for several years, did she not?</p>
        <p>A.: I really don't know what I can say. . . .</p>
        <p>Q.: When Diana gave her famous 1995 televised interview where she confessed to infidelity, eating disorders and the fact that there were ''three of us in this marriage,'' she was accused by several writers of talking ''psychobabble.'' How did you feel about that sort of critique?</p>
        <p>A.: You know, at the time, I was accused of being the scriptwriter, the person who put these words in her mouth. I found the accusation extraordinary. It's such a complete misunderstanding of the therapeutic process, as though therapists were Svengalis.</p>
        <p>The truth is, We don't have an easy language for emotional life. That's why we have writers. They are able to find a way to say things with subtlety. So when a phrase rings true to somebody and then gets repeated, it becomes, all of a sudden, psychobabble. I think the problem with describing emotional life is that we have to stretch ourselves to find the words to say something that is refreshing, accurate, authentic.</p>
        <p>Q.: After Diana's death, many commentators began looking at her life as a feminist parable. Did you?</p>
        <p>A.: Do I think the transformation of a socially privileged but emotionally neglected child to a fairy tale princess, to a woman with a problematic marriage who turns around a sense of victimization to become a real activist in the world and fighter for people's rights as a feminist parable? Sure!</p>
        <p>But is that the story of Diana? That's one story of Diana, isn't it?</p>
        <p>Q.: Are you implying more to Diana's story than has been told?</p>
        <p>A.: I think of hers as the story of someone who was vulnerable. And if that can be elevated into part of the feminist parable -- that one has both strengths and vulnerabilities -- I think that would be a welcome development to our thinking about women.</p>
        <p>Q.: Your highly influential 1978 book, ''Fat Is a Feminist Issue,'' posited the idea that some women had eating disorders because they had been under nurtured by their mothers. Do you still believe that?</p>
        <p>A.: If I were writing that book today, I wouldn't write it in the same way. But I think that there still is a way in which certain aspects of female development are seriously unaddressed.</p>
        <p>I think today women are told that they can conquer the world, but I don't think they are given the emotional equipment to feel safe inside themselves. And food is the first relationship. If we look at mothers' feeding of children, well, the situation is profoundly worse than it was in the 1970's. We now have two generations of women who have been under tremendous assault about: ''You can go out there and be in the world, but don't forget to look gorgeous and slim. And don't forget, you should eat this and not that and you should go to the gym.'' As people felt less effective collectively, politically, we've been offered our bodies as the site of change.</p>
        <p>Q.: So the prevailing idea, in your view, now is, You can't change the world, but you can sculpt your body?</p>
        <p>A.: I don't think that's explicit in people's minds. But I do think that people, in the face of feeling unhappy about their capacity to be effective, have found an area where they can feel they are. I think you can see progress in Western countries in terms of, certainly, certain classes of women's aspirations having been struggled with. It's sort of like there's been a very interesting price, which is an intensification in the breeding of the bodily insecurity of women.</p>
        <p>Q.: Back to Diana. How did you personally deal with her death?</p>
        <p>A.: I'm not really sure I can answer that. I mean, it's shocking when somebody you know and who is in the public eye has died. Mainly, I spent the day warding off journalists.</p>
        <p>Q.: Did the harassment from the press directed at you help you identify with Diana?</p>
        <p>A.: I have never admitted that Diana was my patient, even though it's in the public record. It is not something a therapist can say.</p>
        <p>Of course, when your house is surrounded and you have a clinical practice to deal with, the other people you are seeing have a lot to deal with they didn't bargain for. They are being invaded themselves. I mean, finding  pictures of us in the newspapers on a daily basis. It was not nice.</p>
        <p>Q.: In closing, your new book consists of eight composite case histories of psychoanalytic patients. Many therapists, including Sigmund Freud, wrote in the form of case histories. Why should readers believe veracity of a form that hovers somewhere between fiction and nonfiction?</p>
        <p>A.: My book is about emotional truth. Why should you believe me? You don't have to. The question is, Is there anything there of use to you? Any time a therapist tells a story, they are being so selective. They are privileging one bit of information over another. In the end, it isn't really the patient's story anyway. It's the story the therapist makes of the patient's.</p>
        <p>With the book, I was trying to say, ''This is the therapist's experience.'' If you look from the point of view of the therapist -- the scholarship, the learning, the knowledge, this heart -- what I've written has a certain truth.</p>
