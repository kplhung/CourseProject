If he makes some campaign mistakes, he needs to show a greater willingness to be open and honest about his shortcomings.</p>
        <p>Can Mr. Gore become more transparent in today's tough media environment, which carefully inspects his speeches and lifestyle? It is a difficult question that only he can answer.</p>
