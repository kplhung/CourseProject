        <p>In a fantasy world of opera where plots frequently strain credulity, ''La Traviata'' is unusually realistic. Based on a true story, it was Verdi's only contemporary opera, one inspired by events and attitudes of his time. In fact, even today, it requires no great leap of imagination for audiences to accept that the tragic love of Violetta Valery and Alfredo Germont is unfolding in and around mid-19th-century Paris, and not on stage.</p>
        <p>So why not present it, live and in color, in Paris?</p>
        <p>This weekend an Italian production team did just that, with an ultrarealistic version of ''La Traviata'' set in four different Parisian locations and broadcast live or slightly delayed in 125 countries (it will be rebroadcast by PBS in the United States in late summer, provisionally on Aug. 27). The lush production went off with barely a glitch, with Violetta's poignant demise timed to coincide with the bells of Notre Dame Cathedral chiming at midnight Sunday.</p>
        <p>The hidden star of the $25 million production was of course technology, but it served to enhance the show. The Russian soprano Eteri Gvazava, singing her first ''Traviata,'' was a beautiful and moving Violetta, while the Argentine tenor Jose Cura was a convincing Alfredo and the Italian baritone Rolando Panerai a forceful Giorgio Germont. The National Symphony Orchestra of the RAI, the Italian television network, was conducted by Zubin Mehta.</p>
        <p>Eight years ago the same production team, led by Andrea Andermann, presented a similar version of ''Tosca,'' broadcast at the time and from the places established by Puccini, with Catherine Malfitano and Placido Domingo in the lead roles. With ''La Traviata'' the locations are less specific than those of ''Tosca'' in Rome, yet as the Paris opera, it seemed like an obvious candidate for a new audiovisual adventure.</p>
        <p>To place the production even more firmly in Paris, Mr. Andermann and his director, Giuseppe Patroni Griffi, set it in the Paris of the Universal Exhibition of 1900 and included live views of Paris, including the Eiffel Tower, shot from a boat traveling down the Seine. And for the locations of the four main scenes, they again picked places that reinforced the link to Paris, albeit allowing time for performers to change costumes and move between the scenes.</p>
        <p>For Act I, Violetta's party, where she first meets Alfredo, was held on Saturday evening in the Hotel Boisgelin, the 18th-century Left Bank mansion that is now the residence of the Italian ambassador to Paris. For Act II, the hamlet built for Marie-Antoinette in the park at Versailles became the country retreat of Violetta and Alfredo on Sunday noon. The finale of Act II, Flora's party, where the lovers break up, took place on Sunday evening in the Petit Palais in Paris, itself built for the Universal Exhibition. And for Act III, which began at 11.30 p.m. on Sunday, the ailing Violetta's apartment was on the Ile St.-Louis, with a view of Notre Dame.</p>
        <p>The technical challenge was to link these different locations to the Salle Wagram, where Mr. Mehta was leading the RAI orchestra. Each performer, including a large chorus in two scenes, was equipped with two tiny radio microphones and could follow the conductor's beat on television monitors hidden around each location. In place of a score Mr. Mehta had a television monitor showing the performance as well as an earpiece carrying their voices.</p>
        <p>The recording itself posed other challenges. With television broadcasts of theater opera productions, the cameras stay offstage; with other film versions of opera, like Franco Zefferelli's own ''Traviata,'' the music was prerecorded and the scenes shot in takes like a movie. Here the cameras had to move constantly among the singers without ever being seen by another camera.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the great technical breakthrough this weekend, then, was the daring use of four Steadycams, large cameras strapped to the body of the operator that provided both visual fluidity and stunning close-ups. In Act II they followed Violetta and Giorgio through fields, while in Act III Garett Brown, the Englishman who invented the Steadycam for Stanley Kubrick's film ''The Shining,'' caught the drama of Violetta's reunion with Alfredo and subsequent death in one uninterrupted 28-minute take.</p>
        <p>''In 'Tosca,' we were just amateurs,'' said Vittorio Storaro, the Oscar-winning cinematographer. ''Now the camera is even freer because the Steadycam can be used emotionally. The Steadycam is now part of the style.'' Mr. Andermann put it even more succinctly: ''It's like a work for solo, orchestra and Steadycam.''</p>
        <p>After years of preparation and weeks of rehearsal, however, a final headache was posed by the forecast of stormy weather. And indeed, heavy rain both preceded and followed three of the scenes. But the only significant glitch was a brief blackout during Act I when Ms. Gvazava entered the Left Bank mansion's garden and a camera faltered.</p>
        <p>''It lasted three seconds, but it felt like three days,'' Mr. Andermann said. ''We had five seconds to decide whether to run the backup tape. But then it came back on again. Still, it was a bit like when Placido Domingo fell in the first act of 'Tosca.' It proved it was going out live.''</p>
        <p>For the video version, which will be seen in the United States, the blackout will be replaced for a few seconds by the backup version recorded during the final dress rehearsal. What the American audience will see, though, is Mr. Andermann's proudest ''discovery,'' the tall Siberian-born soprano whom he picked from among hundreds auditioned to be his Violetta.</p>
        <p>''Eteri was supposed to be the surprise, and she is the surprise,'' he said. ''I kept her out of contact with the world for six months, three months learning Italian in Rome, three months during rehearsals. I found her in a small opera company in Germany. She knew nothing about film or television. No one had heard of her. Now I think she will have a marvelous career. She's a natural tragedienne, all that deepness of Russian soul, but she also showed she is a natural comedienne.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 22, 2000, Thursday  An article on June 6 about the filming of a live television production of ''La Traviata'' in Paris for rebroadcast later misspelled the given name of the inventor of the Steadycam -- a camera strapped to the operator's body -- and misstated his nationality. The inventor, who used his camera in the filming, is Garrett Brown, not Garett, and he is American, not British.</p>
