        <p>WHAT a great scene: a splendid afternoon in New York, 250 elementary students sitting in Central Park's Rumsey Playfield to help the New York Public Library kick off another summer reading club membership drive.</p>
        <p>There was a fresh twist to this year's Reading Rally: professional athletes, major league baseball players, New York Mets. The veteran pitcher Al Leiter, first baseman Todd Zeile, the reserve infielder Matt Franco and Manager Bobby Valentine.</p>
        <p>The students sat in bleachers and, on Valentine's cue, chanted, ''Let's Go, Mets.'' Then they settled down to listen to the players. Franco began by reading ''Where the Wild Things Are.'' Zeile read ''A Giraffe and a Half'' as Valentine pantomimed each new layer of the story: ''a giraffe and a half -- with a rat in his hat -- looking cute in his suit.''</p>
        <p>Finally, Leiter read ''The Great Kapok Tree.'' He prefaced the reading with a caveat about his own elementary school days when he didn't love to read as much as he should have.</p>
        <p>This was a good day, though for the young students it was a confusing day of sports news that defines their lives.</p>
        <p>They learned that Ray Lewis, a talented linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens on trial for murder, felony murder and aggravated assault, got the break of his young life: probation, not prison time, in exchange for his testimony against two co-defendants. The students learned that John Rocker, the Atlanta Braves' volatile relief pitcher, who made news for ugly comments about gays, other minority groups and New Yorkers in general, blasted the reporter who wrote the article quoting him. By day's end the students learned that Rocker had been demoted to the minors and fined $5,000.</p>
        <p>What a collage: baseball players reading books to children on a sunny afternoon; a football player paying dearly for bad judgment; a pitcher on the brink of ruining his career.</p>
        <p>''This is more than just a story,'' Leiter said. ''It's almost like a book you can write on professional sports' being a microcosm of society in the year 2000.</p>
        <p>''What I see, even outside my teammates, is that it's a very loose, liberal environment. There are a lot of people who have very little concern for discipline. I think our society has gotten to a point where freedom of this and freedom of that is more important than maybe knowing what's right and wrong and having somebody to let you know what's right and wrong.''</p>
        <p>Leiter broke in with the Yankees in 1987. When the subject of athletes and responsibility is raised, Leiter's lament is similar to the lament of veteran athletes in all sports and older workers in all professions.</p>
        <p>''I came in when Ron Guidry would look at me a certain way and I knew I had to shut up,'' he said. ''Or Dave Righetti. If he saw that I sat too far in the back of the plane, he'd just go like this.'' Leiter motioned with his index finger, as if to say ''come here.''</p>
        <p>''I didn't curse or say, 'Who do you think you are?' '' Leiter said. ''I turned around. I understood the fraternity of it, I respected him as a person and as a player.</p>
        <p>''Back then, the older guys stood their ground and made a stink of it. We, as older guys, we don't hold our ground; we'll let an idiot young player get away with it.''</p>
        <p>Leiter said the reason older players may not chastise younger ones as readily -- or as rigorously -- as before is the perceived volatility of youth. He recalled the old days when you fought and the fight ended and was over. ''Now you're worried someone might have a gun,'' he said. ''You think of stuff like that.''</p>
        <p>Does Leiter really think younger players would respond violently to being corrected? ''Maybe they would,'' he said. ''There was a guy, Jackie Gutierrez, a few years ago, winter ball. A guy made him mad; he went home, got a gun and came back -- forget that. I don't know what kind of unstable mind some of these guys have.</p>
        <p>''What is Rocker thinking? What's he thinking? I don't know. I don't want to make him mad. Plus he's a big guy; probably kick my behind. So you know what? You turn your head and say, 'Forget it.' If the people upstairs don't see this and don't take care of it, just because he throws 97 miles per hour. . . .</p>
        <p>''I don't know.''</p>
        <p>The answers came out right yesterday: Atlanta made Rocker the minor leaguer he has always been. Lewis, as it turned out, was stupid but not guilty. And the Mets? They made 250 elementary school students associate sports with all the good stuff: sunny days, baseball and ''A Giraffe and a Half.''</p>
