        <p>Last Tuesday's article on end-of-life care referred to work sheets to help people determine the treatment they want if they become gravely ill and can  no longer make decisions. The work sheets, called ''The Medical Directive,'' were created by Dr. Linda L. Emanuel, former vice president for ethics at the American Medical Association and now director of a program in professionalism and human rights at Northwestern University Medical Center, and her husband, Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a bioethicist. The directive can be obtained at www.medicaldirective.org, or by calling (800) 214-4553.</p>
