        <p>IF you didn't know to look for it, you could easily miss the stone marker that Herman Benson planted outside his house the other week. The granite and marble rectangle lies under a pine tree in Mr. Benson's front garden. It doesn't say much. But it tells you more than enough.</p>
        <p>Revella Benson, it says. The stone does not mention that she once worked for the teachers' union, or that she did volunteer work, or that for five decades she was Mrs. Benson. It tells you simply that she entered this world on Nov. 2, 1919, and left it on March 4, 1996. That, and one more thing:</p>

        <p>IF you didn't know to look for it, you could easily miss the stone marker that Herman Benson planted outside his house the other week. The granite and marble rectangle lies under a pine tree in Mr. Benson's front garden. It doesn't say much. But it tells you more than enough.</p>
        <p>Revella Benson, it says. The stone does not mention that she once worked for the teachers' union, or that she did volunteer work, or that for five decades she was Mrs. Benson. It tells you simply that she entered this world on Nov. 2, 1919, and left it on March 4, 1996. That, and one more thing:</p>
        <p>''May her killer rot in hell.''</p>
        <p>The words are unexpected, and the fury behind them takes your breath away. That's the idea, Mr. Benson says. He wants people to feel some of the rage that still surges through him four years after some creature murdered his wife at her doorstep, a few paces from the garden, on a quiet street in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''I got some satisfaction from digging the hole for the stone and laying the cement,'' said Mr. Benson, who will turn 85 next month. ''I have to have some way of expressing my anger.''</p>
        <p>His own son, he said, felt that the words were too harsh, that a gentler evocation of this 76-year-old woman might have been in order. But Mr. Benson, a blunt-talking former machinist and labor reformer, would have none of that.</p>
        <p>''I don't want just a memorial to my wife,'' he said. ''I want people to remember what this guy did. And if he's still in the neighborhood, to let him know that it hasn't been forgotten. That would be microscopically consoling to me.''</p>
        <p>Death is never pretty in any of its forms. But when it comes so brutally, it leaves behind an unrelenting ache.</p>
        <p>Any relative or friend of a murder victim knows the pain. When the crime goes unsolved, as this one may despite Mr. Benson's offer of a $6,000 reward, the odds against the wound ever healing grow. That's when all the statistics on how safe the city is now fly out the window.</p>
        <p>Just ask Mr. Benson, sitting at his dining-room table in a jogging suit and a T-shirt bearing the logo of the Association for Union Democracy, a labor watchdog group that he formed years ago.</p>
        <p>He talked about how his wife had come home alone that day in 1996, having returned from the bank with cash for a trip she was about to make to Russia.</p>
        <p>''She took the mail out and opened the door,'' Mr. Benson said. ''Obviously, this guy pushed her inside. The keys and the mail were on the floor. My wife, while she was petite -- 5 foot 3, maybe 110 pounds -- she wasn't the type who'd have said, 'Oh, please, take my purse.' She'd have resisted.''</p>
        <p>Whoever attacked Mrs. Benson smashed her on the head and took her money. The police questioned a suspect, a man from the neighborhood, but the evidence was not strong enough to hold him. There are no other leads now, a detective assigned to the case said.</p>
        <p>MAYBE the police could have done a better job early on, Mr. Benson said. But that's old news. What remains as fresh as yesterday is that steady ache.</p>
        <p>''It's a different kind of grieving than the grieving you might do when you're in your 40's,'' he said. ''That's what I was when my father died. In your 40's, you have time to make a whole life. But at my age, you've got a limited amount of time left. You're not in a position to replace anything anymore.''</p>
        <p>''If someone close to you is ill,'' Mr. Benson continued, ''the first thing you prepare yourself for is their death. But with my wife ---- '' He had to stop to choke back tears. Then he shifted gears.</p>
        <p>''There's another aspect to it,'' he said. ''We were married 50 years. We were part of the left-socialist club. We had kids. We had a life. Her life for a time revolved around the house. Me? I was trying to liberate humanity.'' He interrupted himself with a short laugh mocking youth's grand illusions.</p>
        <p>''She felt I was more interested in humanity than in her, and I felt she was more interested in the kids than in me. In the last years, we sort of worked it through. I was looking forward to growing old with her. We'd reached this mutually enjoyable relationship. At last.''</p>
        <p>Does it make sense, then, to fill however many days he has left with the abiding hate suggested by the stone planted in his garden?</p>
        <p>Sense has nothing to do with it, Mr. Benson replied. ''It's not some obsession dominating my life,'' he said. ''On the other hand, I never forget it. And the prospect of me finding peace is very remote.''</p>
