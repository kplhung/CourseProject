        <p>With Congress and the Clinton administration in a stalemate over whether to rely solely on traditional counting methods in the 2000 Census, Republicans have quietly moved the battle over the head count from Washington to state capitals.</p>
        <p>New Jersey has become the latest battleground over the seemingly arcane but politically volatile issue of statistical sampling in the census.</p>
        <p>At the prompting of state party leaders, the Republican-controlled New Jersey Assembly approved a bill tonight mandating that the state use only census data derived from mailed-in census forms, door-to-door canvasses or other traditional means when it redraws Congressional and state legislative lines. The measure passed 42 to 34, with Republicans and Democrats voting along party lines.</p>
        <p>The Census Bureau and Democrats assert that traditional counting methods should be supplemented with data obtained from a randomly selected national sample of 314,000 households. The information gleaned from these households would be used to adjust population totals and, Census Bureau officials say, make the census more accurate.</p>
        <p>The bureau's plans to implement sampling, however, have become the subject of an intense partisan debate. Republicans fear -- and Democrats hope -- that adjusting the census count by sampling would increase the count of people living in traditionally Democratic areas. As a result, those areas could gain seats in state legislatures at the expense of white suburban areas.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey bill, which both Republicans and Democrats also expect to pass in the State Senate, would, if signed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, make New Jersey the sixth state to ban the use of statistically adjusted census data in the redrawing of Congressional and legislative district lines. The other states are Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Kansas and Virginia.</p>
        <p>Similar measures have been passed in at least one legislative chamber in Louisiana, Utah and Michigan, and the Pennsylvania Senate has passed a nonbinding resolution to prohibit the use of adjusted data in redistricting.</p>
        <p>All the bills have been introduced by Republican state legislators, and votes have followed party lines.</p>
        <p>The movement of the fight over statistical sampling to the states is a deliberate strategy on the part of national leaders of the Republican Party who felt their prospects of blocking sampling in Washington were small.</p>
        <p>In recent years, President Clinton has vetoed bills that would have prevented the Census Bureau from supplementing its count with sampling.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court gave opponents of sampling only a partial victory in 1999 when it ruled that sampling could not be used in determining population counts used in allocating seats in the House of Representatives among the states. But the high court was silent on whether sampling could be used to draw lines for legislative districts.</p>
        <p>Responding to the court decision, the Census Bureau announced that it would produce two sets of population figures. One would be used to apportion seats in the House of Representatives among the states. The other set of numbers could be used to draw Congressional and state legislative districts.</p>
        <p>''After the Supreme Court decision, it was decided the prospects of achieving much more in Washington had basically disappeared,'' said a Republican strategist who was familiar with the strategy but who asked not to be identified. He added, ''It was a definite strategy that once all the progress that could be made in Washington was done, the idea was to turn it over to the states.''</p>
        <p>By adjusting the population counts using numbers from the national sample, the Census Bureau hopes to avoid a repeat of the 1990 Census, in which more than eight million people, mainly members of minority groups, were missed, and four million people, mainly whites, were counted twice.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey today, arguments over the legality of statistical sampling and whether it produces more or less accurate population figures for small geographic areas -- familiar debating points in Washington in recent years -- echoed in Trenton.</p>
        <p>''An argument can be made that statistical sampling can be more accurate on a universal level, say for getting the population of New Jersey,'' said Representative Michael Patrick Carroll, a Republican from Morris County and the chief sponsor of the bill. ''But when you're trying to get the population of Grove Street in Morristown, then statistical sampling has a huge margin of error, something along the lines of 35 percent.''</p>
        <p>Census officials acknowledge that in some tests that were conducted before the actual census, population figures derived by using numbers from a national sample were off by about 35 percent in some small geographic areas. But these officials say figures obtained by traditional counting methods are equally inaccurate.</p>
        <p>Today, a group of black ministers and African-American and Hispanic legislators called on Governor Whitman to veto Mr. Carroll's measure when it reaches her desk.</p>
        <p>At a news conference, the Rev. Reginald P. Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers' Council, said that the bill ''dilutes, lessens and, in fact, negates the votes of Latinos, African-Americans and other minorities.''</p>
        <p>Peter McDonough, a spokesman for Mrs. Whitman, said that the governor had not decided whether she would sign the measure. ''We have not formed an opinion on the bill yet,'' he said.</p>
