      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Whatever else may be said about the musical theater, 50's soundtracks and cabaret songs that the bassist Charlie Haden has covered on his new record ''The Art of the Song'' (Verve/Universal), it can be said that they are all confidently written. They have to be: stage and screen musicals in those days led you firmly through their own paces; inasmuch as they were ambiguous, emotionally or musically, they failed.</p>
        <p>It takes greater effort to feel the full impact of these songs today. What Mr. Haden is able to bring to them is similar to what jazz singers like Shirley Horn and Jimmy Scott bring to their own repertory: a deliberating sensibility that slows down the songs and punctures their outdated confidence, catching them off guard. Performing on Friday night during the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival at the Angel Orensanz Foundation, with a 15-piece chamber orchestra from the Manhattan School of Music and his own group, Quartet West, Mr. Haden himself broke through the surface a few times. The singer Bill Henderson did, too. And Mr. Haden's overall arrangements broke through even more often.</p>

They have to be: stage and screen musicals in those days led you firmly through their own paces; inasmuch as they were ambiguous, emotionally or musically, they failed.</p>
        <p>It takes greater effort to feel the full impact of these songs today. What Mr. Haden is able to bring to them is similar to what jazz singers like Shirley Horn and Jimmy Scott bring to their own repertory: a deliberating sensibility that slows down the songs and punctures their outdated confidence, catching them off guard. Performing on Friday night during the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival at the Angel Orensanz Foundation, with a 15-piece chamber orchestra from the Manhattan School of Music and his own group, Quartet West, Mr. Haden himself broke through the surface a few times. The singer Bill Henderson did, too. And Mr. Haden's overall arrangements broke through even more often.</p>
        <p>In the theme song from the 1955 Edward Dmytryk movie, ''The Left Hand of God,'' Mr. Haden played the melody, plucking it slowly and resoundingly, making it lag against the orchestra's tempo before the scene shifted and suddenly it became a jazz quartet piece. And in ''Why Did I Choose You?,'' from the play ''The Yearling,'' Mr. Henderson sang haltingly, like a patient marksman for the perfect note, breaking words into clean halves of different pitches.</p>
        <p>A bit of the set departed from stage and screen repertory and more liberties were taken. Mr. Haden's ''Child's Play'' orbited around the drummer Lawrence Marable. A handful of drum marches progressed to a cymbal solo; the quartet moved through a calypso before letting Mr. Marable go on a longer drum solo. It wasn't what you expected to hear at a gig with a string orchestra. Even better, there was a musical equivalent of a meaningful film segue. Mr. Haden had the strings play the mournful beginning of Lennie Tristano's ''Requiem,'' recorded after Charlie Parker's death as a solo-piano piece, here orchestrated by Quartet West's pianist Alan Broadbent. The music moved to a quartet version of Parker's ''Back Home Blues,'' filled by the tenor saxophonist Ernie Watts's fast and fluid improvisations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haden saved his ace-in-the-hole for the encore: ''Wayfaring Stranger,'' a gospel song that he knew from performing as a child with his family's country band. He's not a singer, but with an unsteady high voice that owed something to Chet Baker, Mr. Haden made the lyrics secondary: creating an atmosphere of vulnerability, he was saying the same things with his voice that he had been saying with his bass.</p>
        <p>JAZZ FESTIVAL REVIEW  Correction:  June 7, 2000, Wednesday  A jazz review yesterday about a performance on Friday by the bassist Charlie Haden with his group, Quartet West, and a chamber orchestra from the Manhattan School of Music misidentified the arranger for the music on the program, titled ''The Art of the Song.'' He was Alan Broadbent, not Mr. Haden.</p>
