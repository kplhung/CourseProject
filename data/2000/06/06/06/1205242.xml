        <p>Murder and assault charges against Ray Lewis, the Baltimore Ravens' star linebacker, were dropped in an Atlanta courtroom yesterday after he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of obstructing justice and agreed to testify against two co-defendants.</p>
        <p>Lewis, who had faced the possibility of life in prison if convicted of murder, received one year of probation. He cannot drink alcohol or use drugs for one year under the terms of his probation, which falls under the Georgia first offender law.</p>
        <p>He is scheduled to testify today and could be back with the Ravens in their minicamp next week.</p>
        <p>Art Modell, the Ravens' principal owner, said that Lewis, who was the leading tackler in the National Football League last season and who has a four-year, $26 million contract, would probably hold a news conference on Friday at the team's complex near Baltimore.</p>
        <p>N.F.L. officials said Lewis would not be suspended but could be fined.</p>
        <p>Lewis, 25, and two friends, Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting, were charged with murder, felony murder and aggravated assault in the stabbings of Richard Lollar, 24, and Jacinth Baker, 21, early Jan. 31 on a street outside an Atlanta nightclub. The killings occurred a few hours after Super Bowl XXXIV had been played nearby at the Georgia Dome. Lewis had been in Atlanta to participate in Super Bowl-related activities.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors had alleged that Lewis, Oakley and Sweeting killed the men in a street brawl outside the nightclub and then jumped into a stretch limousine that Lewis had rented from Baltimore. Duane Fassett, the limousine driver, was expected to testify that he had seen all three defendants fighting and that Oakley and Sweeting had admitted stabbing the men.</p>
        <p>Evelyn Sparks, who was riding in the limousine, had said she saw another passenger dump a white hotel laundry bag into a garbage bin. Prosecutors said the bag contained Lewis's white suit and alleged it had blood on it. But the suit was never found, and prosecution witnesses changed their testimony from their original statements. None of them could place Lewis at the scene with a knife in his hands.</p>
        <p>The police and friends testified that Lewis tried to cover up his role in the deaths. They said he told the co-defendants to ''keep your mouth shut,'' and that he gave incomplete statements to the police.</p>
        <p>''He fully acknowledges his responsibility for those acts,'' Ed Garland, a lawyer for Lewis, told Judge Alice D. Bonner yesterday.</p>
        <p>District Attorney Paul Howard, while acknowledging disappointment in many witnesses whose testimony differed from earlier statements, said he did not regret prosecuting Lewis. ''A trial is an instrument to reach the truth, and I think that in many respects it has been shielded,'' Howard said. ''We are continuing to try to bring the truth forward.''</p>
        <p>Modell said: ''In my nearly 40 years of ownership, I have had previous incidents involving our players but this one was especially brutal because of the nature of the crime. It has been brutal for all involved but especially for the family and friends of the people slain. I would not have testified at Ray's bond hearing if I didn't think that Ray was innocent of the serious charges. He is a good guy and a great football player, and we welcome him back with open arms.</p>
        <p>''The N.F.L. has its heroes on the field every week and we owe a responsibility to the fans in deed and in conduct. I intend to have a long talk with Ray about that.''</p>
        <p>An N.F.L. spokesman, Joe Browne, said: ''The serious charges were dropped, and he was entirely cleared of those charges. We don't know at this time if there will be a fine that would fall under the conduct detrimental to the league policy because we are going to review the case once his involvement has concluded, including him testifying on Tuesday. We are going to continue to work as hard as we can to see that National Football League players will not be involved in these tough and tragic situations.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the remaining defendants said they remained confident despite the deal. ''No matter what Ray Lewis says, the jury will not find Joseph guilty,'' Steven Sadow, Sweeting's lawyer, said. ''It may have an effect on our overall strategy but then again we have to hear what Ray says.''</p>
        <p>Bruce Harvey, a lawyer for Oakley, said: ''The state just finished proving with several detectives that Lewis is a liar. He was a liar when he was a defendant. I guess now he's the state's liar.''</p>
        <p>David Wolfe, another lawyer for Oakley, suggested there was no reason for Lewis to plead guilty since prosecutors had such a weak case.</p>
        <p>Thomasaina Threatt, an aunt of Lollar, told The Associated Press outside the courtroom yesterday: ''You let a guilty man go free. Where's the justice in that?''</p>
        <p>The Lewis case unfolded after the arrest of the former Carolina Panthers receiver Rae Carruth in January on murder charges in the shooting of his pregnant girlfriend. Critics have said that the two cases show that N.F.L. players' off-field conduct may be out of control and at the least requires more serious counseling.</p>
        <p>Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner, said: ''If anyone in the N.F.L. needed a reminder that high-profile professional athletes need to be extraordinarily careful in their associates and activities, Ray Lewis's experience provides that reminder.''</p>
