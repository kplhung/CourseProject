        <p>There's one heck of a lot of money sloshing around the political troughs these days. According to a report in yesterday's Times by William Glaberson, one race for the Ohio Supreme Court this year is going to cost up to $12 million. We have candidates spending a couple of million dollars to become state legislator, a job that generally carries less prestige than that of nightclub bouncer. At this rate, the next bunch of people stranded on a desert island with a TV crew is going to demand a whole lot more than a lousy million dollars for the effort. (Coming soon: ''Who Wants to Be a Political Consultant?'')</p>
        <p>This brings us to the primary today in New Jersey, where a former Wall Street honcho named Jon Corzine has spent close to $35 million trying to win the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate against former Gov.

        <p>There's one heck of a lot of money sloshing around the political troughs these days. According to a report in yesterday's Times by William Glaberson, one race for the Ohio Supreme Court this year is going to cost up to $12 million. We have candidates spending a couple of million dollars to become state legislator, a job that generally carries less prestige than that of nightclub bouncer. At this rate, the next bunch of people stranded on a desert island with a TV crew is going to demand a whole lot more than a lousy million dollars for the effort. (Coming soon: ''Who Wants to Be a Political Consultant?'')</p>
        <p>This brings us to the primary today in New Jersey, where a former Wall Street honcho named Jon Corzine has spent close to $35 million trying to win the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate against former Gov. Jim Florio, whose entire budget is approximately what Mr. Corzine will be spending on fax machines and commemorative potholders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine is in many ways a fascinating story, although the fascinating part does not seem to follow him onto the campaign trail. Despite the very best coaching money can buy and a dramatically left-wing agenda, he makes Steve Forbes look like Franklin Delano Roosevelt. (In a recent debate, Mr. Corzine delivered this defense for his largess: ''I have not been a politician and spent 30 million and over 30 years building name recognition and establishing the perspectives people might have. I needed to communicate.'')</p>
        <p>According to one of his associates, Mr. Corzine entered the race envisioning a $10 million primary, a plan that went awry somewhere between his decision to hire Robert Shrum, the man who gave us Al Checchi's failed $38 million campaign for governor of California, and the moment he started opening his checkbook for the local Democratic organizations. Mr. Corzine used to be famous for his munificent federal campaign contributions. But he assured New Jersey party officials that his newfound interest in state politics would naturally be reflected by a shift in his gift-giving. This had the approximate effect of tossing a chunk of hamburger into a tank of piranhas. ''Word got out there was this pot there, and things got out of control,'' conceded one campaign official.</p>
        <p>One of the comforting things about American election campaigns is the way the monetary playing field keeps leveling. You come into the game like George W. Bush with a big fat financial cushion and slurp, it vanishes. Nature may abhor a vacuum, but political campaigns can create one in a minute.</p>
        <p>''There's always that pressure -- to donate to the local parties, hire the local potentates' daughters. You end up not saying no to anything,'' recalled John Weaver, who has run presidential campaigns for candidates with too little cash (John McCain) and too much (Phil Gramm). ''Gramm went through the money pretty quickly,'' he recalled. ''We had about 25 opposition research people. We probably needed one.''</p>
        <p>But there is no way that Mr. Corzine could go through his entire $400 million fortune running for Senate -- potentates have only just so many unemployed relatives and you can only run so many ads on TV before the viewer throws a shoe through the screen. Even as it is, Mr. Corzine may have overdone it. He seems to have made people feel a little sorry for Mr. Florio, a feat most New Jersey residents might have hitherto regarded as impossible. Mr. Corzine not only spent about 20 times as much as his opponent, he also managed to make Mr. Florio, whose household income last year was more than $500,000, look underprivileged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine has already broken the record for spending in a U.S. Senate race, set by Michael Huffington in California in 1994. But that was for the entire election, against an incumbent. It takes a lot of money to overcome those odds, especially when your candidate seems both shy and dimwitted. Mr. Corzine is running for a vacant seat, against a primary opponent who is best known for having raised taxes by $2.8 billion. He does not seem to lack aggression. His friends say he is smart, and they rave about his generosity.</p>
        <p>In fact, if all the stories about his beneficence are true, every single person who put a Corzine sign on the front lawn this week should expect to be rewarded with a paid-off mortgage or, at minimum, a reshingled roof. When the money starts sloshing, the wise man goes for a pail.</p>
