        <p>In the second unusual shift in a major national security case in recent weeks, the federal judge who was to oversee the trial of a scientist accused of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets has suddenly announced that he was excusing himself from the case to assume senior status.</p>
        <p>The judge, John Edwards Conway of Federal District Court in Albuquerque, was scheduled to preside over the trial of Wen Ho Lee, a Los Alamos National Laboratory physicist who is accused of having illegally downloaded a mountain of highly sensitive nuclear secrets with the intention of passing them to a foreign power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conway, 66, had earlier set  Wednesday as the date for arguments on a defense motion to suppress the warrant the government had obtained to search Mr. Lee's home last year.</p>
        <p>He had also scheduled for today a pivotal hearing on the defense motion that all the classified information Mr. Lee is accused of downloading be admissible in open court.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee has vigorously denied the charges and has maintained that nearly all the data he downloaded was already publicly available.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conway said in a statement that he had decided to take what is known as senior status, a kind of semiretirement that allows him to reduce his case load and that he had chosen to drop out of the Lee case. An experienced judge, Mr. Conway was nominated to the bench in 1986.</p>
        <p>''I've been there and done that,'' Mr. Conway said of his decision.</p>
        <p>The trial was scheduled for Nov. 6, but that date has also been canceled and the new date will be up to the new judge. The case has now been assigned to Judge James A. Parker, also of Federal District Court in Albuquerque.</p>
        <p>After presiding over a series of bail hearings in January when Mr. Lee was denied bail because of the government's contentions that he posed a grave threat to national security, Judge Parker is familiar with the case.</p>
        <p>The change in judges follows by several weeks the government's unexpected announcement that it was replacing the lead prosecutor in the case. Bob Gorence, an assistant United States attorney in Albuquerque, had been in charge, but he was replaced, without explanation, with George A. Stamboulidis, an experienced organized-crime prosecutor from Long Island.</p>
        <p>''We intend to move as quickly as possible for an expedited trial and hope to exonerate Mr. Lee,'' said Mark Holscher, one of Mr. Lee's lawyers.</p>
        <p>The United States attorney's office in Albuquerque said simply that the announcement ''speaks for itself.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 7, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a federal judge's withdrawal from the coming trial of Wen Ho Lee, the scientist accused of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets, misstated the date of a hearing on defense motions for admission of classified information. It is next Monday; the hearing was not held yesterday.</p>
