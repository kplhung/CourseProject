        <p>The PathoGenesis Corporation, a biotechnology company, said yesterday that it had hired Goldman, Sachs to seek out ''strategic options'' to raise its stock price. The Seattle-based company develops drugs to treat infectious diseases -- particularly lung infections -- including those common in cystic fibrosis. Maryellen Thielen, a spokeswoman for the company, said no timetable had been set. She would not comment whether PathoGenesis is seeking a merger partner or an outright sale of the company. Shares in PathoGenesis traded above $59 before beginning a steep descent in May 1999. The stock rose $1.9375 yesterday, to $19.9375.</p>
