        <p>It is hard to make the case that one player can alter the chemistry in an 11-man game. Yet that is exactly what Clint Mathis has done in his three games, all victories, with the MetroStars.</p>
        <p>''I've always said that, on paper, the MetroStars have a good team,'' Mathis said yesterday from Los Angeles, where he is winding up some personal business. It's a good team that probably just needed a spark. It's not because of me that we're winning. It has been a team effort.</p>

        <p>It is hard to make the case that one player can alter the chemistry in an 11-man game. Yet that is exactly what Clint Mathis has done in his three games, all victories, with the MetroStars.</p>
        <p>''I've always said that, on paper, the MetroStars have a good team,'' Mathis said yesterday from Los Angeles, where he is winding up some personal business. It's a good team that probably just needed a spark. It's not because of me that we're winning. It has been a team effort.</p>
        <p>Mathis, a native of Conyers, Ga., was acquired by the MetroStars on May 17 in a convoluted transaction that was an offshoot of the Los Angeles Galaxy's acquisition of the Mexican star Luis Hernandez. At the Meadowlands, Mathis was reunited with his former coach, Octavio Zambrano, who led the Galaxy to the Major League Soccer championship game last season.</p>
        <p>Normally a midfielder, Mathis has seen time at striker for the MetroStars, teaming with the Colombian Adolfo Valencia as the spearheads of the MetroStars' newly revitalized attack. In his three games with the MetroStars, Mathis has scored two goals and two assists, including a goal this past Saturday night in the Rose Bowl against his former team in a 2-0 victory. The MetroStars (6-6) now have more points (18) then they had all of last season (15).</p>
        <p>After scoring against the Galaxy early in the second half, Mathis lifted his game jersey to reveal a T-shirt underneath emblazoned with ''I Love N.Y.'' on it.</p>
        <p>''It definitely wasn't to disrespect the L.A. fans or the Galaxy,'' he said. ''Coming back to the Rose Bowl is a tremendous feeling for me. I'm trying to win over fans in New York. I want to show my loyalty and let them know I'm very excited to be there.''</p>
        <p>So far, Mathis is succeeding.</p>
        <p>NIKE U.S. CUP</p>
        <p>Without getting too intoxicated with the moment, it is safe to say that the United States national team played perhaps its most solid and proficient game ever in Saturday's 4-0 tournament-opening victory over South Africa in Washington.</p>
        <p>But it would be an expedient exaggeration to suggest that the American performance against a South African team in transition guarantees a ticket to the 2002 World Cup finals. Tonight in Foxboro, Mass., the Americans will play Ireland, a nation that has not qualified for this week's European Championships and that has seen 11 players (including the injured captain, Roy Keane, who plays for Manchester United in England) opt out of Coach Mick McCarthy's selection because of injuries and other commitments.</p>
        <p>Before the start of the eight-day, four-nation tournament, United States Coach Bruce Arena said his ideal plan was to play two different lineups in the first two matches, and then select his best 11 for the match against Mexico (Sunday at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. as part of an event-closing doubleheader, with Ireland playing South Africa). Early indications are that Arena will do exactly that.</p>
        <p>''We're going to make changes,'' Arena said after Saturday's game. ''Whether or not it's 11 players, I can't tell you. It would be very difficult for a lot of our midfielders and forwards to play three matches in eight days, so we're going to have to make some changes.''</p>
        <p>It is likely that Arena will use Brad Friedel in goal; Greg Vanney, Gregg Berhalter, C. J. Brown and Frankie Hejduk on defense; Ben Olsen, John O'Brien, Jovan Kirovski and Steve Ralston in midfield; and Jason Kreis and Ante Razov up front. Ralston, Olsen, Razov and Kreis came on as late substitutes against South Africa. Razov and Kreis are Nos. 1 and 3 in scoring in Major League Soccer, but have yet to match their league output in international games.</p>
        <p>''Players like myself and some of the other guys who are fairly inexperienced at this level have the onus of trying to impress the coach and show that we can fit in,'' Kreis said. 'I have to remember that concentrating on the team concept is the main focus. If I can contribute at a team level, then I think I'll have achieved both goals.''</p>
        <p>PACIFIC CUP</p>
        <p>Given the start in the United States' 5-0 victory over New Zealand, striker Christy Welsh of Massapequa Park, N.Y., responded in grand style by scoring two goals in the game's first 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>Welsh, the 19-year-old who led the nation in scoring as a freshman at Penn State, is competing for a spot on the American women's roster for the Olympics. In only 12 matches with the national team, Welsh has scored 9 goals.</p>
        <p>The United States, which is 3 points behind first-place China and tied with Canada, plays Japan on Thursday in the six-nation tournament in Australia. The Americans and Australia will play the event's final game on Sunday in Newcastle.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>The draws for the men's and women's Olympic tournaments were held in Sydney, Australia, over the weekend. The American women, the defending Olympic and world champions, were grouped with Norway, China and Nigeria in the two-group, eight-nation tournament. The top two teams advance to the semifinals. The United States men drew the Czech Republic, Cameroon and Kuwait in the 12-team tournament. The four group winners will advance to the quarterfinals. . . . In M.L.S., Tampa Bay's Mamadou Diallo scored two goals in a game for the fifth time this season in the Mutiny's victory in Dallas. Diallo leads the league with 12 goals. And Kansas City lost its first match of the season, 3-2, to Chicago on Sunday in which the losing Wizards' goalkeeper, Tony Meola, saw his goals-against average creep up to 0.61 a game. In yesterday's draw for the next round of the United States Open Cup, the MetroStars were sent to Wilmington, N.C., to play the Hammerheads of the D3 developmental league on June 14. Also on that date, the D3 New Jersey Stallions will travel to Miami to play the M.L.S. Fusion. . . . In warm-up matches for Euro 2000 over the weekend, Germany beat the Czech Republic, 3-2, Denmark tied tournament co-host Belgium, 2-2, Yugoslavia lost to the Hong Kong club South China, 4-2, England nipped Malta, 2-1, Portugal blanked Wales, 3-0, and Romania beat Greece, 2-1. The Romanians open the tournament on Monday against the defending champion Germany, which will have Lothar Matthaus available for duty. The MetroStars sweeper has missed three warm-up matches with an injury to his right thigh.</p>
