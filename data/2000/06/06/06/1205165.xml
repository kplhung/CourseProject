        <p>Now that the smoke has cleared from the debate over whether to grant China permanent normal trade with the U.S. and membership in the World Trade Organization, it's time for some wild and irresponsible predictions. I'd like to start the bidding.</p>
        <p>My prediction is that in the wake of the China vote two parties in the world will never be the same again: the Communist Party in China and the Democratic Party in America.</p>
        <p>Let's look at each. For years Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's shift to a free market, described China's economic system as capitalism with socialist characteristics, or was it socialism with capitalist characteristics? I could never keep it straight -- and neither could they. But it no longer matters, because China is now committed to capitalism with W.T.O. characteristics. And that is going to be a huge challenge. If the Chinese Communist Party doesn't adapt, either it will implode or China will explode.</p>
        <p>Here's the problem: By joining the W.T.O., China is basically agreeing to replace its current mixed economy -- part free market, part state controlled -- which is run by the arbitrary decisions of the Communist Party, with an increasingly free-market economy that will abide by international rules, on trade, tariffs and investments, set by the W.T.O.</p>
        <p>This means the Chinese Communist Party is going to have to back off and shape up or ship out. You can't have a flourishing free enterprise system with party hacks interfering with businesses and distorting prices; you can't have W.T.O.-style foreign investment without moving toward an independent judiciary that is free of arbitrary party meddling and is capable of fairly enforcing contracts; and you can't live up to W.T.O. norms without government agencies ready to enforce W.T.O. rules, not Communist Party whims. All that means a different Communist Party.</p>
        <p>''The ideal situation would be if the Communist Party would serve as the bridge and tutor for China's move toward a free-market, rule-of-law-based system,'' argued the Stanford University China scholar Michael Oksenberg. ''If that doesn't happen voluntarily, I see three other possibilities: One is that there will be some catalytic event, like a downturn in the economy, that will force the party to adapt, or face losing power and legitimacy. Second, there will be a split in the party leadership, between those who want to move forward and those who refuse. And third, there could be a mass movement from below. The longer the Chinese Communist Party puts off the first two, the more likely becomes the last scenario.''</p>
        <p>As for the U.S., the China vote was not really a vote about China. It was a vote about how Americans feel about globalization. And it revealed a deeply fractured Democratic Party. The unions were opposed and advocated building walls; the new-economy types, led by President Clinton, favored further globalization; and a large group of old Democrats advocated some middle ground, but had no leader or program to offer.</p>
        <p>''We are becoming the party of resentment and fear, and that is not who we were and that is not who we want to be,'' said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, about the number of Democrats who voted against normal trade with China.</p>
        <p>The challenge for the Democratic Party, if it is to remain united, is to articulate a new progressivism that addresses the worries of working Americans about globalization -- without resorting to trade barriers. There is obviously a strong feeling among the party's rank and file that Mr. Clinton's ''progressivism-lite'' is insufficient. Which is why a lot of Democrats are now groping for a new combination of tax policy, labor policy and social policy that could form a modern progressivism. (It would help if the unions got their heads out of the sand. Imagine if all the money and energy they wasted lobbying against China were applied to health or education funding?)</p>
        <p>Without articulating a new progressivism, the Democrats will either become indistinguishable from Republicans, especially under George W. Bush, or, if the unions have their way, the Democrats will become just kinder, gentler Buchananites.</p>
        <p>So in the wake of the China vote the key question is: Can the Chinese Communists become a real democratic party and can the real Democratic Party become a true progressive party? Nobody gets to stay the same.</p>
