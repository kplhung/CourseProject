        <p>Little progress on arms control was expected from President Clinton's weekend visit to Moscow, and little occurred. President Vladimir Putin of Russia acknowledged that there might soon be a need to counter nuclear threats from unpredictable powers like North Korea. But he did not soften his opposition to American plans for a national missile defense. Mr. Clinton agreed that there should be significant new reductions in offensive missiles as part of a deal that would also amend the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to allow a limited defensive shield.

        <p>Little progress on arms control was expected from President Clinton's weekend visit to Moscow, and little occurred. President Vladimir Putin of Russia acknowledged that there might soon be a need to counter nuclear threats from unpredictable powers like North Korea. But he did not soften his opposition to American plans for a national missile defense. Mr. Clinton agreed that there should be significant new reductions in offensive missiles as part of a deal that would also amend the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to allow a limited defensive shield. But Mr. Clinton held back from steeper cuts that Russia favors and the Pentagon resists.</p>
        <p>Realistically, prospects for reaching agreement on these issues during the remainder of Mr. Clinton's term do not look good. But with more than seven months and at least three further meetings with Mr. Putin before Mr. Clinton leaves office, both sides should keep working.</p>
        <p>The meetings saw some modest but important arms control achievements. America and Russia agreed to safely dispose of 34 metric tons of military plutonium each, enough for thousands of nuclear warheads if smuggled to countries like Libya or Iraq. In addition, an early warning station will be established in Moscow staffed jointly by Russian and American personnel to share information on missile and space launches, reducing the danger of misreading peaceful launches as surprise attacks.</p>
        <p>The most important disagreement is over American plans for a national missile defense. The Clinton administration favors a strictly limited system usable only against smaller states. Russia fears that such a system could later be upgraded to blunt some of its own strategic missile force. If Russia's fears about missile defense could be eased, Moscow would be eager to cut the number of both sides' offensive missiles to 1,500 or lower. The Pentagon, however, wants no fewer than 2,000 to 2,500.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is understandably reluctant to press military leaders on this issue during an election campaign. But a reasonable case can be made that the United States can safely meet all of its military goals with somewhat fewer missiles.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the administration should not rush to meet its own artificial deadline for deciding whether to go ahead with building such a system later this year. The technology has not yet been adequately tested nor have the possibilities for diplomatic agreement been exhausted. Mr. Clinton should not risk unraveling existing treaties by moving too hastily to decide on missile defenses.</p>
