        <p>The Belching Sea</p>
        <p>The sea floor off the mid-Atlantic coast has a bad case of indigestion. Scientists have discovered that there are large amounts of gas trapped beneath it, and there are signs that the gas occasionally bursts through in a kind of suboceanic belch.</p>
        <p>The presence of the gas was confirmed last month during a research cruise by scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and several universities. The scientists were studying the structure of the continental shelf, particularly the presence of what appeared to be large cracks that could someday cause underwater landslides, leading to tsunamis.</p>
        <p>They suspected that rising gas could be at least partly responsible for the cracks.</p>
        <p>Seismic data gathered by the researchers showed the presence of gas beneath the top layers of sediment. But the scientists also realized that the cracks were not really cracks at all, but rather a series of large depressions, up to about three square miles in size, that appeared to be the result of gas eruptions.</p>
        <p>What happens, the scientists suggested, is that gas builds up under the sediments, which are relatively impermeable, until something occurs -- the researchers do not know just what -- to cause it to break through. The violence of the eruption essentially blows a hole in the sea floor, leaving behind the depression.</p>
        <p>The scientists say this phenomenon could weaken the shelf and contribute to the possibility of landslides. While the risk is slight, underwater landslides are not unknown.</p>
        <p>Respect for Aged Insects</p>
        <p>When it comes to fossils, moths and butterflies get far less press than, say, dinosaurs. The lack of attention is partly due to a lack of specimens: only about 700 moth and butterfly fossils exist.</p>
        <p>Scientists are not sure whether the lack of fossils means that these insects were not abundant millions of years ago, or that they just do not preserve well.</p>
        <p>A new discovery, however, indicates that poor preservation is the problem. In one fell swoop, a European scientist has more than doubled the number of these fossils in existence. The researcher, from the University of Gottingen in Germany, reports in Nature the finding of some 1,700 moth specimens in 55-million-year-old sediments in Denmark.</p>
        <p>More than a thousand of the specimens are of one species, and they were often found close together. Since the area in which they were found was once part of the ancient North Sea, the finding indicates that the moths undertook mass migrations over the sea, as some species still do. And mass migration means that there must have been masses of these insects around.</p>
        <p>Loitering Insecticide</p>
        <p>The insecticide chlordane was banned in the United States in 1988, but like other pesticides in the family known as organochlorines, it is known to loiter in the environment.</p>
        <p>Just how long it loiters, and what kind of trouble it gets into, is the subject of a study by scientists at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven. They have shown that even decades after use, chlordane is taken up by many common garden vegetables.</p>
        <p>The researchers grew test crops on a patch of land that used to be a lawn and had been treated with chlordane in 1960. They found that root crops like carrots, beets and potatoes had among the highest concentrations of chlordane, which might be expected given that it is taken up by the roots. But the pesticide was also found in the edible parts of vegetables like spinach, lettuce and zucchini. It was not found in the edible parts of tomatoes, corn or peppers, however.</p>
        <p>Chlordane accumulates in animal tissue, and can lead to disorders of the digestive and nervous systems. The researchers noted, however, that the amounts in the test crops were very small. Washing the vegetables in water will help reduce the chances of consuming the pesticide.</p>
