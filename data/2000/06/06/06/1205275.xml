        <p>Rookies are supposed to bide their time in the Stanley Cup playoffs, settling for little ice time and minor roles. The pressure of the championship round, especially, is supposed to be for battle-tested veterans with years of experience.</p>
        <p>The Devils have plenty of veterans, and they played well again tonight. But two significant goals were scored by the rookies John Madden and Brian Rafalski. Both contributed to a 3-1 victory over the Dallas Stars that left the Devils one victory from their second Stanley Cup championship in five years. In the four-of-seven-game series, the Devils lead, 3-1.</p>
        <p>Tonight's game -- and perhaps the series -- turned in a span of 3 minutes 41 seconds in the third period, when Sergei Brylin, Madden and Rafalski scored on three consecutive shots against goalie Ed Belfour. A one-goal Dallas lead was wiped out in the stunning comeback.</p>
        <p>Referring to the Devils' comeback from a 3-1 deficit in games in the Eastern Conference finals over Philadelphia, Rafalski said: ''We don't want to drag this season on any longer. We'll try to take it to them again on Thursday. Hopefully, we learned from Philly.''</p>
        <p>The teams will play Game 5 Thursday night at Continental Arena in East Rutherford, N.J. By that time, the Devils should have a better sense of the condition of Jason Arnott, their best forward in this tournament.</p>
        <p>Late in the game, while the Devils were on a power play, Arnott was hit in the face by Derian Hatcher, the big Dallas defenseman and captain, who is known for his rough play.</p>
        <p>Arnott, walking unsteadily, had to be helped to the locker room after Hatcher's hit. Neither referee, Kerry Fraser or Bill McCreary, called a penalty.</p>
        <p>Colin Campbell, the senior vice president of the National Hockey League, , said that the incident was a punch by Hatcher and not a stick hit, and that it should have been called a penalty. Thirty-nine minutes after the final buzzer, Arnott, still groggy, was led from the trainer's room to the shower, and the reporters were told to leave the locker room and not talk to him.</p>
        <p>The Devils' domination in the third period was thorough and breathtaking. They outshot the Stars by 31-17 in the game and by 15-4 in the third period. The Stars looked exhausted and demoralized, despite having opened the third period with a 1-0 lead.</p>
        <p>But Brylin scored at 2:27 on a rebound, finishing a Russian combination with Alexander Mogilny and Vladimir Malakhov. Playing one of his best games since joining the Devils in the second half of the regular season, Malakhov took a pass from Mogilny, who had already gained the blue line, and burst into the Dallas zone before passing back to Mogilny, whose shot was stopped by Belfour. Brylin stabbed successfully at the rebound to tie the score at 1-1.</p>
        <p>Referring to Madden, who got the winning goal, Devils Coach Larry Robinson said: ''He's a student of the game. He's very good at getting his angles and knocking pucks out of the air.''</p>
        <p>The Stars were 11-0 in this tournament when they took a lead into the third period until tonight. Ken Hitchcock, coach of the Stars, was stunned by the third-period reversal.</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' Hitchcock said. ''I feel like we got our heart ripped out.''</p>
        <p>Mike Modano, Dallas's star center, said, ''We really don't know what happened.''</p>
        <p>Madden, a center and defensive specialist, scored with his team short-handed at 4:51 to give the Devils a 2-1 lead. During the regular season, he had six short-handed goals to lead the N.H.L. On this penalty-killing shift, it was his second short-handed chance. After Ken Daneyko chipped the puck to Sergei Nemchinov, Madden took the next pass and rushed down the ice to beat the goalie with a wrist shot.</p>
        <p>Rafalski gave the Devils a 3-1 lead at 6:08, streaking in on Belfour after a neutral zone turnover by Dallas.</p>
        <p>Madden and Rafalski are two of the four rookies who play regular roles on the Devils. The others are center Scott Gomez and defenseman Colin White.</p>
        <p>Madden, who returned from a knee injury during the previous series against Philadelphia, was not drafted after playing college hockey for four seasons at Michigan.</p>
        <p>When told that the team captain Scott Stevens had called him a ''cocky, confident kid,' Madden smiled and replied: ''That's pretty much it.''</p>
        <p>Referring to tonight's third-period explosion, Madden said: ''We felt confident. We just said it was a matter of time.''</p>
        <p>Of the Stars, Madden said, ''Dallas kind of fell asleep and we took advantage of it.'' Of himself, Madden said: ''I don't know if I'll be able to sleep the next couple of nights. I wish we were playing tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Since the N.H.L. introduced the four-of-seven format for the finals in 1939, 24 of the 25 teams holding a 3-1 lead have won the trophy. The only team to overcome the 3-0 or 3-1 deficit in the finals was Toronto over Detroit in 1942.</p>
        <p>The scoreless first period saw the return of Stars right wing Jamie Langenbrunner, who had missed five games because of a knee sprain. Langenbrunner was reunited with his center, Joe Nieuwendyk, who had been without a goal or an assist this series.</p>
        <p>Nieuwendyk scored the only goal of the second period, on a power play. The Devils had the best of play in the middle period, keeping the Stars from even shooting on goal for more than 10 minutes, a span that included two Dallas power plays.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>In his annual address to the news media today, Commissioner GARY BETTMAN said the league would soon consider playing some early-season games in Europe, from which about 28 percent of its players come. ''We don't have any current plans, but I would be surprised if it didn't become a reality at some point in the future,'' Bettman said. Among other topics, the commissioner said the league had no plans to expand after Columbus and Minnesota become the 29th and 30th teams.</p>
