        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton took time off from state politics today to come back to feminism and the United Nations, where her audience has always been friendly, to deliver a spirited speech on women's rights.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was not the main event. She spoke at one of many meetings on the margins of a weeklong special General Assembly session to assess the progress of women worldwide, five years after a groundbreaking conference in Beijing.</p>
        <p>She is not part of the American delegation, as she was then. But the difference was lost on her audience of women from every continent, who greeted her with warmth and enthusiasm. They sang, clapped and grasped for her hand as they stormed the podium -- a display that no other speaker is likely to enjoy.</p>
        <p>More than 10,000 women, and some men, from more than 180 countries are in New York for the session and dozens of related events.</p>
        <p>Gita Sen, a development expert from India, said that Mrs. Clinton struck a responsive cord because of her unambiguous commitment to women's rights everywhere, a message many people gathered here say they want to hear more often from Americans, who seem to many to have withdrawn from the organization and the world in recent years.</p>
        <p>''We are committed to making this journey together,'' Mrs. Clinton told a cheering audience invited by Unifem, the United Nations development program for women.</p>
        <p>Her pledge came on a day when a group of independent organizations issued a call for help to forestall efforts they say the Vatican and some conservative Islamic and Catholic countries are making to reverse gains achieved five years ago at the Fourth International Conference on Women. At that meeting, a watershed event that brought grass-roots women's groups and governments together to form networks that continue to operate, most nations pledged to promote women's rights in areas as diverse as education, family planning and sexual relationships.</p>
        <p>Richard C. Holbrooke, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said Mrs. Clinton had laid out the administration's position forcefully. ''It was Hillary saying, do not erode the gains of Beijing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sen, a professor at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore and the leader of an organization for women from developing nations, said in an interview that this conference -- like the one in Beijing -- was in danger of sinking into arid debate over definitions and intentions. This meeting is intended to look for ways to move ahead, not to reopen debate on the issues, she said.</p>
        <p>Women no longer want to debate the meaning of ''family'' or parse what ''access to health care'' means in relation to abortion, said Joana Foster, a Zimbabwean who is a leader of Women in Law and Development in Africa. ''Africans think debates over nuances and language are a waste of time.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Foster represents a new generation of women in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia who have worked hard through international conferences for improvements in women's rights and are determined to maintain the momentum. She said that international agreements like the Beijing ''platform for action'' have real effects in developing countries.</p>
        <p>''Beijing was a catalyst for a whole lot of things,'' she said. ''People are getting into Parliament. Look at somewhere like Namibia, which now has 44 percent women in the local government system. In South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya, Ghana people are now fighting for affirmative action to become part and parcel of the constitutions in their countries.''</p>
        <p>''F.G.M. was a big thing in Beijing for all of us,'' Ms. Foster said, using shorthand for the term female genital mutilation, or the ritual cutting of girls' genitals. ''A lot of countries have passed laws against it. There is that sort of progress going on. For us, we don't want a document that future governments can use to stop the progress.''</p>
        <p>In Beijing five years ago, nations agreed to end laws that discriminate against women and to open more education to girls. They also called for closing income gaps between women and men.</p>
        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan opened the formal assembly session by reminding his audience of goals still to be met. ''Most countries have yet to legislate in favor of women's rights to own land,'' he said. ''Violence against women is still increasing -- both in the home and in the newer types of armed conflict which target civilian populations.''</p>
        <p>Of 110 million children not in school, he said, two-thirds are girls.</p>
