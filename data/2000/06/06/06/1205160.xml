        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: FLAG DEBATE -- The Northern Ireland Assembly met for the first time since home rule was suspended by Britain in February and spent the day debating whether the Union Jack, the Irish tricolor, both flags or no flag should fly over official buildings. The Rev. Ian Paisley, head of the hard-line Ulster Democratic Party that has vowed to disrupt the power-sharing government, protested the refusal of two ministers from Sinn Fein, political ally of the Irish Republican Army, to raise the British flag at their offices.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: THOUSANDS PROTEST KILLING -- Thousands of people held silent vigils across the country to protest the death of Jesus Maria Pedrosa, a town councilor in the Basque city of Durango shot to death by suspected Basque rebels. Mr, Pedrosa was a member of Spain's ruling center-right Popular Party and had received threats from radical Basque separatists. The armed Basque group E.T.A. has killed five people since ending a cease-fire last December.</p>

        <p>EASTERN EUROPE: RESTORING DANUBE DELTA -- Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine and Moldova signed an agreement to enlarge the protected part of the Danube River delta to more than 2.5 million acres of marshes and flood plains. The river, whose tributaries drain 11 countries on the way to the Black Sea, has been heavily polluted during the last century by industrialization and mining on its banks.</p>

        <p>GEORGIA: U.N. HOSTAGES FREED -- Four hostages involved in United Nations work in the rebellious Abkhazia region of Georgia were freed after being held for five days by gunmen. Two were United Nations observers from Denmark, one a British mine-clearing expert and the fourth an Abkhazian interpreter. Although the abductors, part of a group that does not recognize Abkhazia's independence declaration, demanded a ransom, none was apparently paid. The United Nations has about 100 cease-fire monitors in Abkhazia.</p>
        <p>Barbara Crossette (NYT)</p>
        <p>GREECE: U.S. REPORT CONDEMNED -- The government dismissed as an ''anti-Hellenic concoction'' a United States Congressional report suggesting sanctions against Greece because of its ''passive response'' to terrorism. Defending Greece as a safe and secure country, a government spokesman, Dimitris Reppas, said the report ''presented a false picture of Greece.'' The report came a month after the State Department ranked Greece second to Colombia in anti-American terrorist attacks in 1999.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: FOX SLIPS -- Four weeks before the July 2 presidential balloting, Francisco Labastida of the governing party has again edged ahead of Vicente Fox, the leading opposition contender, according to a poll by the newspaper Reforma. The survey of 1,543 voters found Mr. Labastida favored by 42 percent of voters and Mr. Fox by 38 percent. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leftist candidate, was backed by 17 percent. The margin of error was plus or minus 2.5 percent. A poll in early May showed Mr. Fox leading Mr. Labastida.</p>

        <p>PAKISTAN: TAX PROTEST CONTINUES -- The police in Peshawar fired tear gas at merchants and beat up some of those who demonstrated against the government's efforts to catch tax evaders and impose a 15 percent sales tax. Chanting shopkeepers marched in defiance of a ban on protests on the eighth day of a partial strike against the new measures.</p>
        <p>Celia W. Dugger (NYT)</p>
        <p>MALAYSIA: MAHATHIR RULING -- An appeals court refused to overturn a ruling that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad will not be required to testify at the sexual misconduct trial of his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim. Mr. Ibrahim contends the case against him was manufactured by the prime minister.</p>
        <p>Seth Mydans (NYT)</p>
        <p>INDONESIA: SUHARTO QUIZZED -- Prosecutors questioned former President Suharto in a continuing attempt to build a case against him for corruption and abuse of power. It was the first questioning since he was put under house arrest a week ago.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>CONGO: NEW FIGHTING -- Rwanda and Uganda traded artillery and gunfire around Kisangani and at least four civilians were killed, aid workers said. Both nations have deployed troops in Congo since August 1998 to back rebels fighting President Laurent Kabila, but they fell out last year over differences on how to conduct the war. The latest fighting came as both armies were pulling out of Kisangani under a demilitarization pact.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>LEBANON, GERMANY: ASYLUM OFFER -- Germany is prepared to offer political asylum to as many as 400 members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army that disbanded when Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon. Some 6,000 Lebanese fled to Israel; of those, some want to stay, some seek to return and some aspire to be resettled abroad.</p>
        <p>Deborah Sontag (NYT)</p>
        <p>ISRAEL: BRIDGE-COLLAPSE SENTENCES -- A Tel Aviv court sentenced four Israelis to up to 21 months in prison for causing the death through negligence of four Australian athletes in a bridge collapse during the Maccabiah Games three years ago. A fifth defendant, Yoram Eyal, chairman of the organizing committee, was ordered to do six months of community service. All had faced a maximum of three years in jail.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>ISRAEL: ACHILLE LAURO SUIT -- Two Americans sued the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat for their suffering in the 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship, in which an American was killed. A lawyer, Avi Leitner, filed a suit claiming $5 million in damages from Mr. Arafat and Mohammed Abbas, head of the Palestinian group that hijacked the ship off Egypt in 1985. Mr. Leitner said he acted after hearing that Mr. Abbas has been in Jerusalem to attend Palestinian meetings.</p>
