        <p>Ongoing Argument</p>
        <p>Greece's foreign minister, George Papandreou, told the culture committee of the British parliament yesterday in London that Greece would consider shared ownership of the Elgin Marbles provided that the ancient sculptures were in Greece for the 2004 Olympic Games. Ownership of the friezes from the Parthenon in Athens has long been the subject of a dispute between the countries. A spokesman for Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, had earlier ruled out their return to Greece.</p>
        <p>Sargent Revelations</p>
        <p>Born in Florence, Italy, to expatriate American parents, John Singer Sargent (1856-1925) achieved international acclaim as a painter of society portraits by the mid-1880's. But from the outset he was attracted to other subjects that reflected his early travels with his family, his student years in Paris, his friends and acquaintances and his fascination with the exotic.  After 1905 he declined most commissions and devoted himself increasingly to travel. Beginning today, about 100 of Sargent's oils, watercolors and drawings from the extensive holdings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art will be exhibited in the museum's American Wing. ''John Singer Sargent Beyond the Portrait Studio: Paintings, Drawings and Watercolors From the Collection'' continues through Sept. 24.</p>
        <p>Different Drummers</p>
        <p>With names like George Antheil, Aaron Copland, Lou Harrison, Duke Ellington and Steve Reich, they broke new ground in American music in the 20th century. For three weeks beginning tomorrow and ending on June 24, these composers and others like them will be celebrated in San Francisco in the American Mavericks festival under the auspices of Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony. Besides Mr. Thomas and members of the orchestra, participants include the New World Symphony, led by John Adams; Jon Faddis, music director of the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band; and the soprano Lauren Flanigan.</p>
        <p>Final Steps</p>
        <p>Mikhail Baryshnikov and his White Oak Dance Project take to the stage of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Howard Gilman Opera House at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow for the first of four performances through Sunday that include premieres by Yvonne Rainer and John Jasperse, Mr. Baryshnikov in a new solo by Mark Morris, and a celebrated work by Trisha Brown. Concluding the academy's 2000 spring season, Mr. Baryshnikov will dance Mr. Morris's ''Peccadillos'' and appear in the United States premiere of Mr. Jasperse's ''See Through Knot.''</p>
