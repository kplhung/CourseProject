        <p>Though belated, the World Bank's assessment that some of its policies and projects in Africa are failures is encouraging (''World Bank Cites Itself in Study of Africa's Bleak Performance,'' news article, June 1).</p>
        <p>Many policy analysts have long protested the capital-intensive industrial projects as well as the structural adjustment policies undertaken by African countries since the 1960's at the behest of multilateral donors, including the World Bank.</p>

        <p>Though belated, the World Bank's assessment that some of its policies and projects in Africa are failures is encouraging (''World Bank Cites Itself in Study of Africa's Bleak Performance,'' news article, June 1).</p>
        <p>Many policy analysts have long protested the capital-intensive industrial projects as well as the structural adjustment policies undertaken by African countries since the 1960's at the behest of multilateral donors, including the World Bank.</p>
        <p>Not only has the incidence of poverty in African countries failed to improve, but also as a direct consequence of many aid donor policies, the plight of the poor has worsened.</p>
        <p>The responsible thing for the World Bank and its sister agencies to do is to cancel the debt incurred by African countries for projects that failed to produce the desired results.</p>
