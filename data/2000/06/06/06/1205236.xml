        <p>In urban America the blood sport of cockfighting survives only furtively, in seedy pits like one that the police raided in the Bronx on Saturday night. But the game remains far more entrenched in many rural communities like this one in Oklahoma, where cockfighting is legal and where on Friday night 200 people gathered in a carnival atmosphere to watch roosters tear each other apart and to bet on their fates.</p>
        <p>Cockfighting classes, instructional videos and books, newsletters and magazines help fuel a subculture and enterprises across the country. More than half the 170 pages of the May issue of Gamecock, a 62-year-old monthly magazine that claims 16,000 subscribers, are advertisements intended for cockfighters. Breeders from Connecticut to California offer proven winners for $1,000, untested cocks for $75 to $300, and a dozen eggs of winners' mother hens for $100 to $200.</p>

        <p>In urban America the blood sport of cockfighting survives only furtively, in seedy pits like one that the police raided in the Bronx on Saturday night. But the game remains far more entrenched in many rural communities like this one in Oklahoma, where cockfighting is legal and where on Friday night 200 people gathered in a carnival atmosphere to watch roosters tear each other apart and to bet on their fates.</p>
        <p>Cockfighting classes, instructional videos and books, newsletters and magazines help fuel a subculture and enterprises across the country. More than half the 170 pages of the May issue of Gamecock, a 62-year-old monthly magazine that claims 16,000 subscribers, are advertisements intended for cockfighters. Breeders from Connecticut to California offer proven winners for $1,000, untested cocks for $75 to $300, and a dozen eggs of winners' mother hens for $100 to $200.</p>
        <p>The magazines also run advertisements for drugs. A drug labeled Strychly Speed is the stimulant strychine, which the ad says ''speeds up the bird's reflexes, making him quick on the draw.'' Another, called Pure Aggression, can ''put an end to the fear of shock in those long, hard fights.''</p>
        <p>Through the advertisements and feed stores, a score of manufacturers sell gaffs and a wide variety of curved, razor-sharp knives, up to three inches long, for mounting on legs. The knives, costing up to $100, tend to kill faster than the cheaper, icepick-like gaffs, because they rip as well as pierce. Cockfighters maintain that the weapons simply deal a quick death to birds that would die in much longer bouts were they to use their natural spurs.</p>
        <p>Cockfighting endures legally in New Mexico, Louisiana and Oklahoma, which is home to more than 40 established back-road pits, and illegally in many other states. While betting is a misdemeanor, it is routine at the pits and ignored by most county sheriffs.</p>
        <p>All states allow breeding of the birds, which are then sold to states where fighting is legal or to the Philippines, Guam, Mexico and other countries where the sport is popular or, in states where it is outlawed, are hustled out to the woods and urban back alleys for illicit lethal combat.  From coast to coast, farm-supply companies sell trainloads of vitamin- and nutrient-enriched feed for fighting cocks.</p>
        <p>In the last few years, though, cockfighting has become a target of animal protection advocates, who call it barbaric and unambiguously cruel, the only sport since the states banned dog fighting decades ago in which animals are bred solely to kill one another.</p>
        <p>Two years ago the Humane Society of the United States helped opponents of cockfighting in Arizona and Missouri win ballot initiatives that outlawed it.</p>
        <p>Early this year the Oklahoma Coalition Against Cockfighting, largely with $100,000 in financing from the society, gathered more than 100,000 signatures for a referendum on a proposal to ban the fights and punish violators with fines of up to $25,000 and jail terms of up to 10 years.</p>
        <p>And on Capitol Hill, more than 180 House members and more than 40 senators are sponsoring bills to prohibit the interstate shipment of fighting cocks.</p>
        <p>But for now, anyway, the bouts continue. Here in Kellyville, some 30 miles southwest of Tulsa, only a sign showing the small silhouette of a rooster marks the turn off Route 66 up a dirt road to the corrugated metal home of the Kellyville Game Club. In the club's glass-enclosed pit, two men step onto the dirt floor from opposite corners. Each cradles under one arm a fidgeting 2-year-old rooster with alert orange eyes.</p>
        <p>These are strikingly majestic birds, one of the Hatch breed, the other a Roundhead, with shimmering manes of orange hackle feathers and arching black tail feathers. But their heads, shorn of wattles and haughty combs, have become bobbing red knobs. Bound like a thorn to the nub of each of their severed spurs is a curved, two-inch-long steel gaff that can puncture heart, brain or lungs with the thrust of a heel.</p>
        <p>The birds are two of the 156, paired by weapons and weight, that will fight at the regular Friday night derby starting at 10 o'clock. Admission, restricted to members of the breeders' association and their families, costs $11. The 39 men who have each entered the required number of four birds pay participation fees of up to $75. The fees go into the purse, which is sometimes as much as $5,000, that will go to the owners of the four winning birds.</p>
        <p>In the pit now, the two men -- one in a red baseball cap, the other wearing a gray T-shirt -- begin the precombat ritual of thrusting their birds back and forth, beak to beak. The betting starts. ''Ten on the red hat,'' shouts one of 200 viewers in the six tiers of seats surrounding the pit. ''Twenty on the gray shirt,'' shouts another.</p>
        <p>The referee shouts, ''Ready, pit!'' The birds explode from their handlers' grasps and collide breast to breast, a foot off the ground. Beak grabbing beak, hackles flaring like porcupine quills, they bounce apart and then collide, again and again.</p>
        <p>The Hatch takes command. The Roundhead rolls over, then revives. He pounds the Hatch with a foot, spearing a lung. The Hatch fades, hunkering down and refusing to budge. As he coughs up drops of blood, his breathing sounds like footsteps on gravel. The Roundhead, fatigued but intact, wins. The Hatch is carried off, most likely to die.</p>
        <p>No one knows the full dimensions of this business. Sandy C. Johnson, an Ohio breeder who is director of administration for the United Gamefowl Breeders Association, with affiliates in 33 states, declined to disclose any specific figures but said cockfighting generated hundreds of millions of dollars a year in sales of birds, medicines, feed, and breeding and fighting gear. Alabama, Ms. Johnson said, is probably the biggest producer, just ahead of Texas.</p>
        <p>''We estimate that Alabama has 11,545 farms'' that raise fighting cocks, she said.</p>
        <p>And Mark Urbanowsky, president of Blue Bonnet Feeds in Ardmore, Okla., said he and his competitors sold fighting-cock feed worth $25 million to $30 million a year to stores in  Oklahoma alone.</p>
        <p>Among the industry's customers is Jeffrey Pearce, who has a fighting-cock farm on the outskirts of Sallisaw, Okla. Mr. Pearce moved to Oklahoma eight years ago from Oregon, where he and his father were breeders; his father-in-law is a prominent breeder in Texas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearce raises Hatches, known for power, and Blacks, known for speed, and also crosses them. He has all but sold out this year's production of 200 2-year-olds, for $150 to $175 each, largely to the Philippines and Guam.</p>
        <p>Starting at puberty, at 6 to 8  months old, Mr. Pearce said, each male bird (called a stag until its first molt, at the age of 2 years) is dispatched to its own two-sided, four-foot-tall metal A-frame hut. There it is tethered by a nine-foot cord, to keep it off the turf of neighboring males and so prevent injury from fighting.</p>
        <p>Across Mr. Pearce's closely groomed field of huts, 200 stags strutted and crowed the other day, pecking at the grass and their feed. Unlike inexpert breeders, Mr. Pearce said, he does not drug the birds to instill greater aggressiveness. Rather, he said, good care produces the toughest, healthiest fighters.</p>
        <p>''We don't make them fight,'' he said. ''Their sole purpose in life is to fight.''</p>
        <p>Larry Oliver, lawyer for the 7,000-member Oklahoma Gamefowl Breeders Association, said of the birds, ''They just don't like each other.''</p>
        <p>George R. Day, who raises 100 cocks on a 250-acre property near Mr. Pearce's, said the opponents of cockfighting did not understand the sport's meaning in many rural areas. ''You have people who have never lived a rural lifestyle trying to impress their values on us,'' Mr. Day said. ''It doesn't mean they're right. It just means there are more of them.''</p>
        <p>To the Humane Society and the state's anti-cockfighting coalition, the sport is beyond justification, unlike killing for food. ''We have this as a top priority,'' Wayne Pacelle, senior vice president of the society, said of opposition to the sport.</p>
        <p>With their game and their livelihood under attack, members of the Oklahoma breeders' association are engaged in legal challenges against the coalition's referendum, trying to stall it for at least a year beyond this November and gain enough time to kill it through lobbying.</p>
        <p>The coalition could succeed: opposition to cockfighting has become politically dicey. Cockfighters contribute to political campaigns, and, like most Oklahoma officeholders, Gov. Frank Keating, a Republican, has been staying out of the dispute.</p>
        <p>''He really has not taken a position,'' said John Cox, a spokesman for Mr. Keating. ''I don't think he sees a lot of merit in cockfighting, but there are a lot of business interests in the state that have to be adhered to a little bit.''</p>
