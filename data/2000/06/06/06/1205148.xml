        <p>The Richard Wagner Foundation today postponed a decision over who should take over from Wolfgang Wagner as director of the annual Wagner Festival in Bayreuth, Germany, leaving a long-running battle among descendants of the composer to continue at least until this summer's festival is over.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner, the composer's 80-year-old grandson, is not required to retire, but he has been facing growing demands that he resign after 49 years in the job. Before today's meeting, he had indicated that he might be willing to step aside for his wife, Gudrun Wagner, but not for two other candidates: his niece, Nike Wagner, backed by Elmar Weingarten, general manager of the Berlin Philharmonic; and Eva Wagner-Pasquier, his daughter by his first marriage, who was backed by another of the composer's great-grandchildren, Wieland Lafferentz.</p>

        <p>The Richard Wagner Foundation today postponed a decision over who should take over from Wolfgang Wagner as director of the annual Wagner Festival in Bayreuth, Germany, leaving a long-running battle among descendants of the composer to continue at least until this summer's festival is over.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner, the composer's 80-year-old grandson, is not required to retire, but he has been facing growing demands that he resign after 49 years in the job. Before today's meeting, he had indicated that he might be willing to step aside for his wife, Gudrun Wagner, but not for two other candidates: his niece, Nike Wagner, backed by Elmar Weingarten, general manager of the Berlin Philharmonic; and Eva Wagner-Pasquier, his daughter by his first marriage, who was backed by another of the composer's great-grandchildren, Wieland Lafferentz.</p>
        <p>Josef Erhard of the Bavarian State Culture Ministry, who is chairman of the foundation's 24-member board, said that the succession decision had been delayed because Mrs. Wagner-Pasquier and Mr. Lafferentz had opted at the last minute to present themselves as individual candidates rather than as a team.</p>
        <p>They were given until Oct. 1 to draw up their respective plans for the festival.</p>
