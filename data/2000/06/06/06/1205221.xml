        <p>Anyone watching the hostage crisis in Luxembourg last week would applaud the release of nursery school children and their caregivers after a crazed gunman was shot by local police. But by using a camera crew as camouflage for their gun and by shooting the suspect who thought he was getting ready to give a television interview, the Luxembourg police have now made it more dangerous for other journalists to do their jobs and thus harder for them to get news of critical importance.</p>
        <p>The agonizing 30-hour incident began when a man described by Luxembourg police as psychologically troubled stormed into a village day care center, taking 37 children and three teachers hostage. When the gunman demanded time on television to air his grievances about losing custody of his children, police borrowed equipment from Radio Television Luxembourg to use as cover. They then shot and disabled the gunman as he approached the mock crew for his appointed ''interview.''</p>

        <p>The agonizing 30-hour incident began when a man described by Luxembourg police as psychologically troubled stormed into a village day care center, taking 37 children and three teachers hostage.

        <p>While police celebrated the happy outcome, many experienced journalists were understandably horrified at the way they went about it. In their business of gathering information, journalists must be armed only with the tools of their reporting trade, and their sole task is to transmit as much truth and reality as possible to their public audience. The singularity of that mission is what makes it crucial that journalists are solely journalists, not secret government agents or undercover police. Any confusion, even for a good cause, can expand into more danger in the future for people who already range across some of the most dangerous territory in the world -- trying to convince rebel armies, for example, that a press badge is a sign of neutrality, the camera is not a threat and the reporter is not armed. Any erosion of journalistic neutrality could limit the wide range of news and information we have learned to expect from the international media.</p>
