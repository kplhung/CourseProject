        <p>President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine used the occasion of a brief visit by President Clinton today to announce that the Chernobyl nuclear power station, site of the worst radiation accident in history, would be closed by Dec. 15.</p>

        <p>President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine used the occasion of a brief visit by President Clinton today to announce that the Chernobyl nuclear power station, site of the worst radiation accident in history, would be closed by Dec. 15.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuchma made the announcement after the two leaders met in the white-and-gilded splendor of the Mariinsky presidential palace. ''This is a hopeful moment,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''It is also a moment when we remember those who suffered as a result of the accident there.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Clinton, the six-hour visit to Ukraine was the last stop on his last scheduled trip to Europe as president.</p>
        <p>He began the day in Moscow with an address to both chambers of the Russian Parliament, in which he acknowledged that ''Americans have to overcome the temptation to think that we have all the answers.'' He then urged the Russians not to reject Washington's proposal for a limited national missile defense and to make the changes needed to achieve full participation in global trade. [Excerpts, Page A10.]</p>
        <p>In earlier conversations with President Vladimir V. Putin, Mr. Clinton failed to shake the Kremlin's staunch opposition to Washington's proposal for a new missile defense plan -- an opposition shared by China and much of Europe on the ground that it could spur a new arms race. The United States argues that it would construct defenses only against the chance of missiles being launched by ''rogue states.''</p>
        <p>Ukraine has been under pressure from the United States and Europe to shut down the last working reactor at the Chernobyl plant, where a fire in 1986 spewed radiation over vast stretches of northeastern Europe and caused untold thousands of deaths and illnesses. Mr. Kuchma had previously said he was prepared to shut down the plant if major industrialized nations would contribute toward the $1.2 billion Ukraine needs to build two new nuclear power plants.</p>
        <p>In his announcement today, Mr. Kuchma said Mr. Clinton had agreed to solicit the Group of Seven industrialized nations and Russia for help in shouldering the costs. Mr. Clinton also pledged $78 million in new American aid to help Ukraine repair and strengthen the concrete ''sarcophagus'' over the damaged reactor, $2 million to improve security at other Ukrainian nuclear plants, and an unspecified amount to assist the tens of thousands whose livelihood comes from Chernobyl.</p>
        <p>''The aim of this decision is to reduce nuclear risks in the world,'' Mr. Kuchma said, adding that it ''was not easy.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the Ukrainians who depend on the plant for jobs, Ukraine faces an energy crisis. The country also needs to spend an estimated $750 million to reconstruct and stabilize the hastily built concrete and steel structure that encases the shattered No. 4 reactor hall and the nearly 200 tons of radioactive fuel inside; the structure is riddled with leaks and threatening to crack open.</p>
        <p>Besides his talks with Mr. Kuchma, Mr. Clinton went outdoors to address tens of thousands of people packed into St. Michael's Square.</p>
        <p>''Today, the oppressors are gone,'' he said. ''Stalin is gone. The Nazis are gone. But you, the people of Ukraine, you are still here, stronger than ever! You must build a free and prosperous Ukraine. Do not give up. Keep on fighting.''</p>
        <p>The purpose of the speech, administration officials said, was to give a strong show of support for Ukraine's independence, which came with the collapse of Communism nine years ago after three centuries of rule by Moscow, but has run up against severe economic hardship and rampant corruption. Ukraine is one of the  largest recipients of American aid.</p>
        <p>It was also a photo opportunity that Mr. Clinton seized to the fullest. He stood atop a dais and waved to the crowd against a backdrop of the gold-domed, Wedgwood-blue Monastery of St. Michael and a city square decked with huge Ukrainian and American flags.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, concluding his two-day visit to Moscow, Mr. Clinton took a defensive line in the speech to  Parliament. ''Many Russians still suspect that America does not wish you well,'' he said. ''The United States wants a strong Russia.''</p>
        <p>The reception, however, was muted. Some deputies skipped the session, partly because they were confused about when it was to start. For many of them, NATO's expansion, the alliance's war with Yugoslavia and the administration's plans to build a limited missile defense have created the impression here that Washington revels in its role as the world's only superpower and is determined to thwart the emergence of new powers, including Russia.</p>
        <p>''Russia's future is very important to others because it is among the most important journeys the world will witness in my lifetime,'' Mr. Clinton declared from the lectern.</p>
        <p>On security issues, he insisted that his administration's plan for a limited missile defense was not a drive for military superiority. On the economy, Mr. Clinton backed Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization, a bid that still requires Moscow to change some of its economic policies.</p>
        <p>''Russia should not be the only major industrialized country standing outside this global trading system,'' he said. ''We will support you, but you must know the decision to join the W.T.O. requires difficult choices that only you can make.''</p>
        <p>On the political front, he criticized the Russian prosecution of its war in Chechnya. ''My question on Chechnya was an honest one, the question of a friend,'' he said. ''And that is whether any war can be won that requires large numbers of civilian casualties and has no political component bringing about a solution.''</p>
        <p>More generally, Mr. Clinton insisted that he had not come to Moscow to preach to Russians, saying, ''You will choose what your interests clearly demand and what your people democratically embrace.''</p>
        <p>The reviews after the speech were generally positive.</p>
        <p>''It was a clever lecture,'' said Andrei Kokoshin, a legislator in the Fatherland - All Russia party and a national security adviser when Boris N. Yeltsin was president. ''I think Clinton is still important.''</p>
        <p>''It was not a full hall,'' said Nikolai Kharitonov, the leader of an agrarian faction that generally supports President Putin. ''But it was not a bad speech. Let's hope it is realized constructively.''</p>
        <p>Communists and nationalists in  Parliament were predictably critical. Communists held up signs saying, ''Clinton Go Home'' and ''Defense Missile System Is a Threat to the World.'' They chanted, ''Soviet Union! Soviet Union!'' over and over.</p>
        <p>Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who plays the part of an ardent nationalist but who is seen by many Russians  as a kind of clown on the political fringe, created a row during Mr. Clinton's speech, screaming ''Shame! Shame!''</p>
        <p>''Who is he teaching how to live?'' Mr. Zhirinovsky yelled. ''It's profane! We are not going to do what America commands!''</p>
        <p>After addressing Parliament, Mr. Clinton received the warmer welcome he was more accustomed to during his previous four trips here as president when he called on Mr. Yeltsin at his residence outside Moscow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin had a sense of camaraderie that is clearly lacking in the president's businesslike meetings with Mr. Putin. And Mr. Clinton seemed to look back on the old meetings wistfully.</p>
        <p>''We all just had a nice visit, just like old days,'' Mr. Clinton said.  ''He's got a beautiful place.''</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>Valuable, Bush Aide Says  By The New York Times  WASHINGTON, June 5</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush, said that the Clinton-Putin meeting had been valuable in advancing relations between the United States and Russia. Mr. Bush welcomed agreements on disposal of nuclear materials and establishment of a joint center to monitor missile launchings, he said.</p>
        <p>More importantly, Mr. Fleischer said, the two leaders did not sign any binding pledges that would limit action by the next president.</p>
        <p>''The governor is pleased the agreements they reached do not tie the hands of President Clinton's successor so that we can have a defense policy that reflects post-cold war thinking,'' Mr. Fleischer said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 17, 2000, Saturday  Because of an editing error, a front-page article on June 6 about Ukraine's announcement that it will close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by Dec. 15 referred incorrectly to the number of deaths and illnesses caused by the accident there in 1986. The Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a report that 31 people died in the first weeks after the accident. Other estimates of deaths ultimately caused by the accident range from dozens to tens of thousands; estimates of illnesses range from hundreds to tens of thousands. It has not been established that the accident caused untold thousands of deaths and illnesses.</p>
