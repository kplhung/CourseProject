        <p>Closing the deal took just a few hours of phone calls between Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York. Making it official took just two minutes' worth of votes by the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>But the agreement that the two states reached last week, unleashing millions of dollars' worth of stalled projects, was the result of a roller coaster ride of negotiations and escalating demands that had stretched out for more than a year.</p>
        <p>So on Friday, as the agency's 12-member board ratified the deal, which had been clinched the day before by the two governors, many of those involved in the talks could not forget that troubling history amid the governors' tableau of unity.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to calculate whether one state got more out of the deal than the other. But it is clear that their jockeying for advantage allowed a dispute over a single issue -- a 30-year lease for the Maersk-Sealand shipping line to expand its operations at the Elizabeth Marine Terminal in New Jersey -- to snowball into an 18-month stalemate in which all of the Port Authority's long-term projects were kept in limbo.</p>
        <p>The impasse took on a life of its own, said an adviser to Governor Whitman, until ''everything was on the table'' -- including otherwise routine expenditures, like the purchase of cranes and barges.</p>
        <p>As the board met month after month, unable to agree on much, negotiators talked almost daily.</p>
        <p>The turning point in the talks is difficult to identify. Some involved in the negotiations say key steps to compromise were an increase in the pool of money available for New York projects, New Jersey's willingness to consider fare increases on the PATH commuter rail line, and a realization on both sides that basic philosophical differences over the operations of the Port Authority were not going to be reconciled.</p>
        <p>In addition, there was growing criticism from newspaper editorial boards and former governors in both states, who said the dispute was embarrassing the agency.</p>
        <p>But even as the settlement was being finalized, some people close to the negotiations suggested that the dispute could have been settled earlier but for each state's determination to wring out greater concessions in the allocation of funds.</p>
        <p>And even as they detailed the concessions that had made the settlement possible, officials on both sides of the Hudson privately pointed out ways in which their state had ''won.''</p>
        <p>Some New York officials suggested that they had triumphed by negotiating an additional $287 million to cover unexpected increases in the cost of a terminal and rail link between Kennedy International Airport and subway and commuter lines in Queens, as well as $13 million for economic development in the neighborhood. But New Jersey officials pointed out that the Port Authority had already committed $1.6 billion toward the project, and was unlikely to leave it incomplete.</p>
        <p>New Jersey, in turn, claimed victory in overcoming New York's objections to the Maersk-Sealand lease, which Mrs. Whitman said would guarantee the region's dominance among East Coast ports. But New York officials suggested that by temporarily withholding their support for a lease that they agree was necessary, they had prevented the Port Authority from handing a ''blank check'' to the shipping company.</p>
        <p>Lewis Eisenberg, chairman of the Port Authority and New Jersey's chief negotiator throughout the stalemate, said last week that such comments on either side amounted to a kind of bean counting.</p>
        <p>''It is what someone would say to stir the pot and continue the friction,'' he said. ''But it is contrary to the spirit which I saw in the governors of New York and New Jersey as they worked this out.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Eisenberg and his New York counterpart, Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority and chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, concede that philosophical differences persist between the states on the direction and approach of the agency.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the dispute was the  Maersk-Sealand lease, which was first proposed in early 1999 and ran aground because New York officials believed that it provided too large a subsidy to the company.</p>
        <p>In retaliation, Mrs. Whitman ordered Mr. Eisenberg and other New Jersey representatives on the board to block two projects New York favored: the leasing of air rights over the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan and efforts to sell or lease the World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>Then, in February 1999, officials close to Mrs. Whitman said privately that the two sides had tentatively agreed to a compromise. It would have provided New York with $120 million in Port Authority funds for projects of the state's choosing, as well as $120 million for New York's plan to renovate the main post office in mid-Manhattan into a transportation and office complex that would include a new Pennsylvania Station.</p>
        <p>But hopes of a settlement were dashed, some officials say, when Mr. Pataki was pressed by advisers and Port Authority officials to hold out for more. Mr. Gargano disputes this,  saying that in early 1999 the Pataki administration was adamant that the Maersk-Sealand lease would unfairly benefit New Jersey by providing hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies to the shipper.</p>
        <p>New York said it should receive a pool of money for New York-based projects equal to the amount of that subsidy -- an amount calculated by New York at various times to be as much as $1.6 billion and as little as $250 million over the life of the lease. New York also called for the port agency to support its Manhattan transportation complex as a truly regional project. But New Jersey balked, Mr. Gargano said.</p>
        <p>The next opportunity to resolve the dispute came last June, said Michael P. Torpey, Governor Whitman's chief of staff, when the states faced warnings from American Airlines at Kennedy Airport and Continental Airlines at Newark International Airport. The two airlines said their expansion projects at the airports were in jeopardy without Port Authority investments.</p>
        <p>That led to an effort to reach a settlement that would include the  airport projects, the Maersk-Sealand lease and the World Trade Center and Port Authority Bus Terminal plans. But the broader accord sank even as the airport projects were approved; both states believed that the airport projects were too important to risk, Mr. Torpey said.</p>
        <p>Through much of last summer and into the fall, only minor progress was made in settling the dispute.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the agency had a growing backlog of stalled spending proposals generally supported by the two states -- for new cranes, development of Howland Hook as a container port on Staten Island, and the lease or sale of the Port Authority-owned Newark Legal Center.</p>
        <p>New York increasingly framed the dispute as a debate over fairness.  New Jersey, it said, was disproportionately benefiting from Port Authority spending -- whether at Newark Airport, which had grown tremendously in the last decade, or in New Jersey's containerized-cargo operations. Easily reached by truck and rail, they had long ago supplanted New York's traffic-clogged port areas as prime berthing areas for the new, larger container ships.</p>
        <p>So New York began pushing for an increase in fares on the PATH line, long a sore point. The Port Authority is subsidizing the line to the tune of $181 million this year, and New York sees that as a benefit mainly for New Jersey residents.</p>
        <p>In last week's deal, New Jersey agreed to allow a study that is likely to lead to the first increase in the $1 PATH fare since 1987.</p>
        <p>In the end, said Mr. Torpey, it was unclear exactly why the feud was resolved when it was. ''It had gone on long enough,'' he said. ''Maybe it was time. Maybe it was in the stars.''</p>
