        <p>Jason Tyner approached the Mets stretching near the batting cage with trepidation yesterday, like the timid high school freshman who had just been promoted from the junior varsity to the varsity. He nodded as he joined Mike Piazza, Todd Zeile and the other starters for the pregame exercise routine.</p>
        <p>Piazza smiled when he noticed the nervous rookie, reached across to shake his hand and said: ''It's the same game. Just have fun.'' Tyner exhaled. Then Zeile shook Tyner's hand. Robin Ventura followed Zeile and Tyner felt like he belonged.</p>

        <p>Jason Tyner approached the Mets stretching near the batting cage with trepidation yesterday, like the timid high school freshman who had just been promoted from the junior varsity to the varsity. He nodded as he joined Mike Piazza, Todd Zeile and the other starters for the pregame exercise routine.</p>
        <p>Piazza smiled when he noticed the nervous rookie, reached across to shake his hand and said: ''It's the same game. Just have fun.'' Tyner exhaled. Then Zeile shook Tyner's hand. Robin Ventura followed Zeile and Tyner felt like he belonged.</p>
        <p>''Since I was 5 years old,'' Tyner said, ''all I wanted to do with my life was be a major league baseball player.''</p>
        <p>The 23-year-old Tyner fulfilled that 18-year-old chase last night and did it in style, chopping a single in his first major league at-bat off Mike Mussina before adding a sharp run-scoring single off Mussina in his second at-bat.</p>
        <p>The new leadoff man also dropped a gorgeous sacrifice bunt and barely missed beating it out for his third hit. The Mets lost to the Orioles, 4-2, but, for one night and maybe hundreds to come, they found a leadoff hitter.</p>
        <p>''I thought Jason looked like a regular out there,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''He looked like he knew what he was doing.''</p>
        <p>Leaning against a pillar in the clubhouse after the game, Tyner spoke of being physically and emotionally spent. He was so excited that he did not sleep and could not eat. He finally ate a granola bar in the fourth inning to stop his stomach from growling.</p>
        <p>''I was mentally exhausted halfway through the game,'' Tyner said. ''It was just all the emotion that I've had since they called me up.''</p>
        <p>Twenty-two days after the Mets released Rickey Henderson and said Tyner was not ready for the majors, they changed their plans and recalled him from Class AAA Norfolk. Tyner was shifted from center field to left at Norfolk about 10 days ago and, after four Mets had combined to bat .227 with 12 runs scored in 18 games in the leadoff spot, he was summoned.</p>
        <p>Still, as recently as last Saturday, General Manager Steve Phillips had said Tyner had ''a ways to go defensively'' before the Mets would promote him.</p>
        <p>''We tend to be conservative,'' Phillips said. ''But it got to the point where we asked 'What else does the kid have to do to be ready?' We decided to give him a shot.''</p>
        <p>Tyner, who was batting .347 with 21 runs batted in and 27 stolen bases at Norfolk, will continue to bat leadoff in the immediate future and maybe for another decade. Valentine indirectly defended Joe McEwing and Melvin Mora, who auditioned as leadoff men, by saying Tyner's development spurred the change.</p>
        <p>''I was told he's ready,'' Valentine said. ''I said, 'If he's ready, let's see him do his thing.' ''</p>
        <p>Although Tyner is 6 feet 1 inch and 172 pounds, his arms are as skinny as the handle of a bat. He is a pesky hitter who has great speed and a terrific bunter who has a strong eye, but he has absolutely no power. Tyner did not hit a home run in 802 minor league at-bats and he did not homer in 794 at-bats at Texas A&amp;M, where he batted .387 over three years.</p>
        <p>After the Mets released Henderson, they tried McEwing, Jon Nunnally, Derek Bell and Mora in the leadoff spot. McEwing led off nine times and was 10 for 38 (.263 average) with six runs scored.</p>
        <p>Tyner said he ''didn't go home and wait by the phone,'' once Henderson was gone, but he stayed optimistic.</p>
        <p>''I always had hope that there was a chance,'' Tyner said. ''I tried not to worry about it. I just tried to get hits every day. I didn't expect to be here this soon, but I'm thrilled.''</p>
        <p>Valentine, who rarely hits balls to players during practice, worked with Tyner before the game, whacking balls into the left-field corner so the rookie could grow accustomed to the different caroms.</p>
        <p>''I think I'm ready to play out there,'' Tyner said.</p>
        <p>Tyner's wife, Annie, was at last night's game and his father, Richard, and sister, Miste, who was 19 yesterday, flew from Beaumont, Tex., to New York to attend the game. Since Tyner's father paid more than $1,000 apiece for the plane tickets, the newest Met joked that he needed to get some hits.</p>
        <p>But Tyner admitted there was one person whose absence made his debut incomplete. Juliet Tyner, Jason's mother, died of breast cancer on June 16, 1998, two weeks after he was drafted. Since then, Tyner makes the sign of the cross before every at-bat as a tribute.</p>
        <p>''I'll definitely think about my mom tonight,'' Tyner said. ''I think about her before every game.''</p>
