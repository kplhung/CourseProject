        <p>In scrupulous and sometimes numbingly technical fashion, an agent for the Internal Revenue Service offered the most specific details yet today in the Federal tax-fraud trial of Albert J. Pirro Jr. on how the government analyzed his tax returns.</p>

        <p>In scrupulous and sometimes numbingly technical fashion, an agent for the Internal Revenue Service offered the most specific details yet today in the Federal tax-fraud trial of Albert J. Pirro Jr. on how the government analyzed his tax returns.</p>
        <p>Relying on an array of computer-powered graphics and video-display monitors, and after each juror received a workbook of charts, Revenue Agent John Dennehy first outlined the basics of income-tax reporting, then asserted that Mr. Pirro claimed $123,924 in improper deductions in 1995.</p>
        <p>In one instance, he calculated that Mr. Pirro, the husband of Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, tried to deduct $3,551 in landscaping and home-improvement projects as business expenses.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Dennehy said, ''the corrected amount was $1.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dennehy is the government's key, and presumably last, witness in its case against Mr. Pirro and his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro. Together, the brothers are accused of improperly deducting more than $1.2 million of Albert Pirro's personal expenses as business write-offs between 1988 and 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dennehy's testimony is expected to last several intense days. And, true to the pivotal nature of that testimony, Mr. Pirro's defense lawyers lodged more than three dozen objections today, the equivalent of one every 10 minutes, largely over the complaint that Mr. Dennehy was offering legal conclusions, not expert testimony. Mr. Pirro's lead lawyer, Gustave H. Newman, even requested a mistrial, which was denied by Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Pirro's high-powered legal team scored some points when Judge Parker granted a request to remind jurors, repeatedly, that what Mr. Dennehy was saying did not outweigh the testimony of other witnesses, and should not be taken as legal proof of the Pirros' wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>''You are free to reject or accept all or part of the charts as you see fit,'' Judge Parker said.</p>
        <p>If anything, though, the jurors needed all of their powers of concentration today to last through Day 11 of testimony in the trial.</p>
        <p>After Judge Parker sketched out a clear and concise framework for jurors on what constituted deductible expenses (a full-time home office) and what did not (political contributions), Mr. Dennehy took the stand and began offering testimony on the differences between S and C corporations, on depreciation costs, on other accounting principles.</p>
        <p>It wasn't exactly a poetry reading. On several occasions, an assistant United States attorney, Cathy Seibel, patiently and good-naturedly asked Mr. Dennehy to explain concepts in layman's terms.</p>
        <p>What did seem to help, though, were the visual aids and the specifics of the Pirros' spending habits. One video display offered a visual portrait of Albert Pirro's myriad companies more akin to the diagram of a hub-and-spoke airport (with Mr. Pirro as the hub) or the solar system (with Mr. Pirro as the sun).</p>
        <p>One business expense claimed by Mr. Pirro was $10,323.40 paid to Summit Aviation. But Mr. Dennehy said  he had calculated that $8,892 of that bill was personal, because it involved a plane trip to Maine to visit the Pirro children at summer camp.</p>
