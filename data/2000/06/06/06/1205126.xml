        <p>Considering how hard it is for many people to remember what they did even the day before, it is remarkable that so many childhood memories remain intact.</p>
        <p>But now a new study shows that many of those memories may be, at best, suspect.</p>
        <p>Researchers at Northwestern University, recalling a study they did in the 60's of 73 boys asking all manner of questions about their lives, decided to ask them the same questions. Only this time, the ''boys'' were an average of 48 years old.</p>
        <p>Writing in The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the researchers said they had found wide disparities between how the boys described their teenage years and how the 67 men they found recalled them. On the most basic issues, there was often no correlation between the two sets of answers.</p>
        <p>''To our surprise,'' said Dr. Daniel Offer, a professor of psychiatry, ''they just didn't know. They had no idea what they said. They thought they were telling us what they felt then.''</p>
        <p>In a few limited areas, subjects gave similar answers, including about their fathers' salaries and their own earning hopes. On everything else, though, all bets were off. And no pattern seemed apparent: on some issues, they remembered life as being better, on others, worse.</p>
        <p>In the 60's, for example, 28 percent of the boys said they did not like homework or school; later, 58 percent said they did not like them. On the other hand, while 82 percent of the boys said they were disciplined physically, only 33 of the men said they had been.</p>
        <p>When confronted with the discrepancies between their first and second answers, some men were skeptical. ''They argued with us,'' he said. ''They said, 'No, that's not true.' ''</p>
