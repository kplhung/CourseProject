        <p>In a move that seems likely to snuff out Indonesia's latest flirtation with capital controls, the new managing director of the International Monetary Fund declared today that closing off Indonesian capital markets would hinder the nation's fragile economic recovery.</p>
        <p>The I.M.F.'s chief, Horst Kohler, emerged from a breakfast meeting with President Abdurrahman Wahid and briskly dispelled speculation that the I.M.F. would agree to an Indonesian effort to defend its faltering currency, the rupiah, by placing controls on the currency.</p>
        <p>''The president and I fully agreed that the introduction of capital controls would be counterproductive,'' said Mr. Kohler, who was making his first visit to Jakarta as I.M.F. director. ''He feels that it would be the wrong decision, and I agree, because such a decision would deter foreign investors.''</p>
        <p>Later in the day, a senior economic adviser to President Wahid, Sofyan Wanandi, said: ''It's over. It's not going to happen.''</p>
        <p>On Friday, Indonesian officials said they were considering some type of controls to stabilize the rupiah, which has dropped 18 percent in value since the beginning of the year because of fears of renewed political unrest. Indonesia considered setting a fixed rate for the rupiah in early 1998, after a far more serious slide, but backed off under intense pressure from the I.M.F.</p>
        <p>Although the economy has crept back from the abyss of 1998, it still depends on billions of dollars in loans from the fund to bail out debt-ridden banks and corporations. Last week, the I.M.F. approved a $372 million loan that had been held up because officials at the fund were unhappy with the fitful pace of economic restructuring under President Wahid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohler made it clear today that Indonesia's future lay in strictly adhering to the I.M.F.'s program. He urged the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Authority to accelerate the sale of assets of insolvent banks and companies. Failure to do so, he said, ''would lead to a deterioration in the asset values.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohler's predecessor, Michel Camdessus, aroused resentment here in 1998, when he stood watching with arms folded, as Indonesia's longtime president, Suharto, reluctantly signed a loan agreement with the fund.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Kohler did not mince words today, he took pains not to sound imperious. ''We are here to help and support, not to lecture and impose,'' he said. ''But of course we offer frank advice.''</p>
        <p>Indonesia's markets responded quickly to Mr. Kohler. The rupiah, which had been rallying in recent days on speculation that it might be stabilized, slipped to a rate of 8,460 to the dollar from 8,400. But the stock market welcomed the news, jumping 2.14 percent.</p>
        <p>Capital controls have gained some credibility in Asia in the last two years, since Malaysia imposed controls on its currency and embarked on a powerful recovery. Analysts here said that officials were focusing less on a fixed exchange rate than on measures to keep rupiah in the country, like requiring exporters to repatriate and convert their foreign-exchange earnings.</p>
        <p>But Indonesia is not Malaysia, which has disciplined officials to police the flow of currencies in and out of the country. ''It wouldn't work here,'' said Umar Juoro, a former adviser to Mr. Wahid's immediate predecessor, B. J. Habibie. ''We don't have the capacity to do it. All it would do is to discourage foreign capital from coming back to Indonesia.''</p>
        <p>The decline in the rupiah has rattled officials because they remember that Mr. Suharto was ultimately swept out of power by violent unrest ignited by a weak currency. But some analysts said the impact of a weaker rupiah would not be as great this time because it hurts companies with debt denominated in dollars. And most of those companies are already bankrupt.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the weak rupiah has bolstered Indonesian exports, which jumped 29 percent in April compared with April 1999. For Indonesia to achieve Mr. Wahid's personal goal of 5 percent-plus economic growth this year, it will need continued strength in exports.</p>
        <p>A big drawback of controls may be political, an American consultant, James W. Castle, indicated. Since Indonesia fell into crisis, the rupiah has been a reliable barometer of public confidence in the government.</p>
        <p>The recent decline was precipitated by Mr. Wahid's decision to dismiss two of his most respected cabinet ministers and replace them with people regarded as cronies. ''It was a lesson to the government that there is a price to pay,'' Mr. Castle said. ''The danger is that it would lose that feedback mechanism.''</p>
