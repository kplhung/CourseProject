        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Clinton and Putin Unable to Agree on Missile Barrier'' (front page, June 5):</p>
        <p>Judging by its foreign policy decisions, the Clinton administration and Congress often act as if we had a new cold war with Russia and China.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the original ''Star Wars'' program still have to struggle against the delusions of supporters like the ones who have emerged from their post-Reagan hibernation.</p>
        <p>At a 1993 conference that I attended in Moscow about the conversion of military resources, a denizen of the ''secret cities'' of the Russian military suggested that we should both build more and bigger missiles to defend ourselves against asteroids. This got quite a laugh from the audience, but failing that, others there might like a new bottomless bankroll from a ''joint'' anti-missile system. Pork and technical-scientific quackery go well together and know no borders.</p>
