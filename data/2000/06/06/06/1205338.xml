        <p>WALLENGREN-Henry M. After living with AIDS, Henry succumbed to complications from cancer on June 2nd, 2000. He was 54 years old. He grew up in East Longmeadow, MA but had called NYC home for the last 26 years. He was a proud and active member of the Arts Community whose interests spanned a wide spectrum. In the art world, he was the owner of Wallengren USA, a SoHo gallery. From there he explored the world of theatrical publishing with the Samuel French Company. Most recently, he worked as an agent and manager, first at the Ann Steele Agency and then for his own client group, Wallengren. He leaves a daughter, Emily Wallengren of Boston, and a son, Dr. Matthew Wallengren of Baltimore, as well as Willy, his 9-year old yellow lab. He will be greatly missed but fondly remembered by his family and close group of friends. There will be a small private service with a memorial service to be announced.</p>
