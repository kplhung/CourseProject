        <p>F.C.C. Approves Purchase Of Cable Giant by AT&amp;T  The Federal Communications Commission approved AT&amp;T's acquisition of MediaOne after ordering the companies to sell some of their assets, clearing the final obstacle to a merger that will create the nation's largest provider of cable television, long-distance telephone service and high-speed Internet access.</p>
        <p>The F.C.C. gave the companies a choice of which programming and cable subsidiaries and investments to sell to comply with a rule that forbids a corporation from having interests in more than 30 percent of the nation's cable and satellite television market. Officials estimate that, without any divestitures, AT&amp;T and MediaOne would control more than 40 percent of that market. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>Thomson to Purchase Primark  Thomson, which is selling most of its newspapers to focus on the electronic distribution of legal and financial information, agreed to buy Primark for $842 million. Thomson will pay $38 a share for Primark, a 31 percent premium to Primark's stock price of $29 on Friday. Shares of Primark, based in Waltham, Mass., rose $8.25, to $37.25, while Thomson fell 1.80 Canadian dollars, to 49.20. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Merrill in Talks to Buy Market Maker  Merrill Lynch is in discussions to buy Herzog Heine Geduld for nearly $1 billion, according to people close to the companies. The deal, which could be announced as soon as today, would give Merrill a much larger role in trading on the Nasdaq stock market. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Stocks Mixed in Lackluster Session  Stock prices were mixed as investors paused after last week's big advance. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.54 points, to 10,815.30, but the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.63 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,467.63. The Nasdaq composite index, which rose a record 19 percent last week, rallied during the last hour of trading and closed at 3,821.76, up 8.38 points, or 0.2 percent. [C12.]</p>
        <p>S.E.C. Tackles Variable Annuities  In the midst of a federal examination of the sale of variable annuities, a fast-growing and controversial combination of mutual funds and insurance, a senior Securities and Exchange Commission official issued a stern warning that misleading tactics and incomplete disclosure would not be tolerated.

        <p>Start-Up Seeks Copyright Ruling  In a case experts say may have broad implications for whether automated Internet search engines can be held liable for linking to pirated material, an Internet start-up, MP3Board.com, has asked a federal judge to find that it is not abetting copyright infringement simply by linking to MP3 music files. [C27.]</p>
        <p>I.M.F. Chief Advises Indonesia  The new managing director of the International Monetary Fund said that closing off Indonesian capital markets would hinder the nation's fragile economic recovery. The I.M.F.'s chief, Horst Kohler, left, emerged from a breakfast meeting with President Abdurrahman Wahid and briskly dispelled speculation that the I.M.F. would agree to an Indonesian effort to defend its faltering currency, the rupiah, by placing controls on the currency.

        <p>Health and Safety Concerns in China  As China applies to join the World Trade Organization, international concern has been directed at the sometimes unpleasant or dangerous working conditions in the country's export industries, especially those owned by foreign companies. But health and safety conditions are generally far worse, Chinese and foreign experts say, in the many smaller factories and mines that have sprung up during the economic reforms of the last two decades, mainly producing goods for the domestic market.

        <p>Pepsi Quietly Introduces Juice Drink  Pepsi-Cola, which is known for big-league marketing tactics, is introducing FruitWorks, a line of juice-based noncarbonated drinks that will compete with Snapple and Fruitopia, with comparatively -- but deliberately -- little fanfare.
