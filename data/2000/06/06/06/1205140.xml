        <p>By the latest count, which rose with fresh announcements yesterday, astronomers have detected massive black holes at the centers of more than 30 galaxies. The numbers are now sufficient, scientists say, to recognize patterns and to understand where, when and how the most powerful black holes typically develop.</p>
        <p>New observations by the Hubble Space Telescope support the theory that black holes did not precede a galaxy's birth but evolved along with the galaxy. They were fed by the same inward collapse of gas that caused the creation of stars in the galaxy.</p>
        <p>The bigger the galaxy, the findings show, the bigger its central black hole, the extremely dense mass with a gravitational pull so powerful that it sucks in everything nearby and allows nothing to escape, not even light.</p>
        <p>One of the more intriguing surprises is that the typical black hole, large or relatively small, invariably has a mass that is two-tenths of one percent of the mass of the high-density central region, or bulge, of the galaxy. Why such a proportion pertains to so many examples is still a mystery.</p>
        <p>Another pattern to emerge from the observations is that the more massive black holes -- ones with compressed masses more than one billion times that of the Sun -- appear to develop only in elliptically shaped galaxies with dense central bulges of stars. Pure disk-shaped galaxies, like the neighboring Messier 33, have no observable black holes. And galaxies with only small bulges, like the Milky Way, Earth's home galaxy, have relatively small black holes of a few million solar masses.</p>
        <p>''For the first time, we can put strong constraints on the relationship between galaxy formation and black hole formation and growth,'' said Dr. John Kormendy of the University of Texas at Austin, a member of an international team of astronomers that reported the new findings yesterday at a meeting in Rochester of the American Astronomical Society.</p>
        <p>The team announced the discovery of eight more supermassive black holes in galactic centers, based on observations by the Hubble telescope's newly installed spectrograph.</p>
        <p>Although the objects themselves cannot be detected because no radiation escapes their gravity, their presence can be inferred by measuring the velocities of disks of gas trapped in the clutches of black holes, like water swirling around a drain. At least 33 such objects have now been observed.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kormendy and colleagues, Dr. Karl Gebhardt of the University of California at Santa Cruz and Dr. Douglas Richstone of the University of Michigan, said that the correlations between galaxy structures and black hole masses were important clues to how the galaxies formed and the source of energy to make quasars shine. Quasars, the brightest lights in the distant universe, are the radiating signatures of matter plunging into the black hole and feeding its growth at the center of a young galaxy.</p>
        <p>''The main events that made a galaxy and the ones that made its black hole shine as a quasar are the same events,'' Dr. Kormendy said.</p>
        <p>Such behavior, the scientists explained, appears to be most violent in galaxies and most productive of black holes where primordial hydrogen gas collapses into a dense central bulge around a small compact core of matter, a ''seed'' black hole. The observations so far have yielded no clues to how the seed black holes originated.</p>
        <p>''Our team will try to solve this mystery in the coming year by looking for the smallest nuclear black holes that we can find with Hubble,'' Dr. Richstone said.</p>
        <p>Analyzing the new findings, scientists have identified two other ways in which galaxy evolution possibly affects black hole development. Even though regular disk galaxies do not appear to harbor massive black holes, if two disk galaxies with small black holes collide, the merger would produce an elliptical galaxy with conditions feeding the appetites of growing black holes. Also, in some cases, gas flowing to the center of a disk galaxy could gradually create a ''pseudo bulge,'' as opposed to a primordial bulge, where a black hole could accumulate mass.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gebhardt notes that the more massive black holes dwell in galaxies where the stars move especially fast, even the ones far beyond the gravitational influence of the black hole.</p>
        <p>He said this was strong evidence that the host galaxy underwent a tremendous collapse in its earliest stages.</p>
        <p>So the mass of a black hole may tell a lot about its history.</p>
