        <p>Former Suitor Adds Voice to Suit</p>
        <p>The things people do when they are dating: SENATOR ROBERT G. TORRICELLI testified yesterday that PATRICIA DUFF once videotaped him manipulating the jaw of a 2,000-year-old human skull like a ventriloquist's dummy as he said, ''In my experience, in my day, those New York courts are fixed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli, a Democrat from New Jersey who went out with Ms. Duff in 1998 and 1999, also said that they were repeatedly followed by men he believed were security personnel working for her former husband, the billionaire RONALD O. PERELMAN. Mr. Torricelli said that the strain contributed to his breakup with Ms. Duff, an influential Democrat who is credited with raising enormous amounts of money for President Clinton in 1996.</p>
        <p>By Mr. Torricelli's account, the security men pretty much ruined a vacation the couple took in Rome. Mr. Torricelli said he noticed the men trailing them and pointed them out to Ms. Duff. She became so upset that she tripped and fell, breaking her foot. In the doctor's office, she turned on her video camera and Mr. Torricelli picked up the skull and acted out what he called a ''parody.''  JUSTICE EILEEN C. BRANSTEN, who is presiding over Ms. Duff's custody proceeding against Mr. Perelman in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, showed no reaction.</p>
        <p>Irreverence In Tony Overtime</p>
        <p>If the Tony Awards had been more like the Academy Awards -- that is, if the envelope-opening and the speeches had run longer -- ROSIE O'DONNELL would not have had to fill time at the end of the telecast on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>But the Tonys were over a minute or two early, so Ms. O'Donnell recycled a routine that she and NATHAN LANE had been doing while the television audience was watching commercials: they poked fun at the Broadway impresarios FRAN and BARRY WEISSLER. Ms. O'Donnell called them ''the cheapest producers in the free world,'' and Mr. Lane added, ''They're doing a national tour of 'Guy and Doll.' ''</p>
        <p>Then Ms. O'Donnell and Mr. Lane reeled off other pseudo-Weissler shows, including ''Once Upon a Cot'' and ''Grand Motel 6.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weissler, whose productions include ''Chicago'' and ''Kiss Me Kate,'' said yesterday that the jokes were ''in the spirit of fun,'' adding that he had been tempted to ''throw a few things back at Rosie.''</p>
        <p>''But,'' he said, sounding as if he were picking up Ms. O'Donnell's refrain, ''my wife had the good sense to grab my jacket and hold me down. I didn't want to mess it up; I had to return the tuxedo before 11:30.''</p>
        <p>An Invitation To Take Lightly</p>
        <p>At the bottom of the invitations to a party for the fashion photographer FRANCESCO SCAVULLO'S new book were two words: ''Dress: nude.''</p>
        <p>The book, by the way, is called ''Scavullo Nudes.'' It features more than 100 photographs of such celebrities as LINDA EVANGELISTA and CLAUDIA SCHIFFER.</p>
        <p>The dress-code suggestion was supposed to be a joke, said MATTHEW RICH, the event planner Mr. Scavullo had hired. Mr. Scavullo was not copying SPENCER TUNICK'S Sunday-morning photo shoot with 152 naked people. ''Helen Gurley Brown told me, 'I have a taupe suit and that's as close as I'll get,' '' Mr. Rich said, adding, ''Can't people lighten up?''</p>
        <p>A Cattle Call For Designers</p>
        <p>Designers began lining up outside the Henri Bendel department store at 6 a.m. yesterday, hoping to be discovered the way ANNA SUI, TODD OLDHAM and SUSAN LAZAR were discovered -- at an ''open see'' at Bendel, when buyers take a look at whatever merchandise is set before them.</p>
        <p>Bendel's reinstituted the Fifth Avenue equivalent of a Broadway casting call yesterday, and ANNE-MARIE OLSON, a Canadian-born designer who makes $280 handbags, was smiling: Bendel's buyers had placed an order. ''What can I say?'' she said. ''It's our first season.''</p>
        <p>But not all the designers who had lined up in the morning left happy. ''They described my things as too sporty for Bendel's,'' said WILMA SAMMACK, who had shown the buyers her line of rubbery dresses. ''With cloth, you have to iron it.''</p>
        <p>Kissinger Treated</p>
        <p>HENRY A. KISSINGER, the former Secretary of State, was hospitalized for what his office called a checkup after he had problems with the vision in his right eye.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kissinger, 77, was traveling in Europe last week when a small blood clot entered an artery in his eye and impaired his vision, his office said in a statement. Mr. Kissinger returned to New York for treatment and then went to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for a checkup. He is expected to return to New York today or tomorrow. His office declined to release other details.</p>
        <p>JAMES BARRON with David Rohde and Glenn Collins</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 7, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, a report in the Public Lives column yesterday about the Tony Awards misidentified the producers of the current revival of Cole Porter's ''Kiss Me, Kate'' in some copies. They were Roger Berlind and Roger Horchow, not Fran and Barry Weissler.</p>
