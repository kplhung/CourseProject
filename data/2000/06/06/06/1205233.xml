        <p>Britain's largest Internet service provider, Freeserve P.L.C., is in talks to be acquired by Deutsche Telekom's Internet arm, T-Online International, according to executives close to the discussions. Freeserve, not yet two years old, was the first in Britain to market an Internet service with no online charges, a business model that has been widely imitated.</p>
        <p>Freeserve and its parent, the Dixons Group P.L.C., a British electronics retailer, have held preliminary talks with other interested parties, including Terra Networks, the Internet unit of Telefonica, along with the British cable company NTL Inc. and British Telecommunications P.L.C., the executives said.</p>
        <p>While the executives stressed that a deal was not yet imminent, they said T-Online had expressed the most interest in Freeserve. The two companies have discussed how much T-Online might pay for Freeserve, but have yet to reach any agreement over price, the executives said. Freeserve's current market capitalization is almost $8 billion. The executives also cautioned that the companies could decide to abandon the effort.</p>
        <p>Dixons, which owns 80 percent of Freeserve, formed it about a year and half ago as a side bet to get into the Internet business. It stunned competitors by quickly becoming Britain's most heavily used Internet access provider, displacing AOL U.K., a unit of AOL Europe, then a joint venture of America Online and the German media giant Bertelsmann.</p>
        <p>Freeserve's main innovation was to attract customers by not charging a monthly subscription fee. In contrast to the United States, where Internet access over a telephone line is relatively inexpensive, users in Britain, as in most other European countries, pay by the minute for local phone calls, in addition to the charge from the Internet access provider.</p>
        <p>Instead of charging a subscription fee, Freeserve makes money by sharing a percentage of the revenue generated by the cost of a user's telephone call with the phone company. Freeserve also derives revenue from advertising and electronic commerce.</p>
        <p>A deal with Freeserve would be a major boon for T-Online as it tries to create a company that reaches beyond Germany to compete with the likes of Terra Networks, which just acquired the United States based Internet company Lycos and also has operations in Latin America.</p>
