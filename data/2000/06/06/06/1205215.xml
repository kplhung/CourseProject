        <p>A federal agency determined yesterday that Morgan Stanley Dean Witter had discriminated against women working in one of its divisions, opening the door for lawsuits -- and possibly a class action -- against the firm.</p>
        <p>In one of the first investigations into pay and promotion practices at a big Wall Street investment bank, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said it had seen evidence of ''a pattern and practice'' of discrimination against women employed in Morgan Stanley's institutional stocks division. The case stems from a complaint filed with the commission in 1998 by Allison K. Schieffelin, a trader of convertible bonds, who said she had repeatedly been denied a promotion because of her sex.</p>
        <p>The commission said the evidence it had gathered supported Ms. Schieffelin's contention that less-deserving men had been promoted to the top rank of managing director while she had remained a principal. The commission also said it had found that the firm had retaliated against Ms. Schieffelin for making her complaints.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Morgan Stanley, Ray O'Rourke, said: ''We emphatically disagree with the findings of the commission.  We do not practice or condone employment discrimination of any kind. We think the commission can only have misinterpreted the data that we gave them because the information shows no pattern of discrimination whatsoever.''</p>
        <p>The determination signals that the commission may sue Morgan Stanley if the firm does not agree to a settlement. Litigation is a last resort for the commission; last year, it received 77,444 complaints and filed just 465 suits against employers.</p>
        <p>The commission has filed suit against some brokerage firms and some major corporations, including Mitsubishi Motors and the drugmaker Astra U.S.A., in recent years. But it has not disclosed any actions against major Wall Street firms in about a decade.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mitsubishi agreed to pay $34 million to hundreds of women who worked in its auto factory in central Illinois and agreed to outside monitoring of complaints of harassment and discrimination. That settlement was easily the biggest of its kind, supplanting one the commission reached earlier that year with Astra, in which Astra agreed to pay $10 million, to admit that it had fostered a hostile work environment for women and to apologize.</p>
        <p>It is not clear what sort of settlement the commission will try to elicit from Morgan Stanley, but a monetary settlement could be substantial because employees in the division are highly paid. Managing directors at the firm can earn several million dollars a year, and they can hold those jobs for 10 years or more.</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, Merrill Lynch consented to the commission's monitoring of its hiring of women and minorities in its brokerage business. Recent high-profile sexual harassment and discrimination suits against Merrill Lynch and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup were filed in federal court without intervention by the commission.</p>
        <p>In September, the commission demanded that Morgan Stanley turn over comprehensive records on hiring, pay and promotions in its institutional stocks division, in which Ms. Schieffelin has worked in her 14-year career. Neither the commission nor Mr. O'Rourke would describe the information the firm turned over.</p>
        <p>Wayne Outten, a lawyer in Manhattan who represents Ms. Schieffelin, said he had not seen the data but he believed the commission had received profiles of the division's employees going back about 15 years. He said there were other facts that supported Ms. Schieffelin's complaint, including that only 3 of 50 managing directors in the division were women and that senior executives of the firm had condoned and participated in firm-sponsored events from which women were excluded.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schieffelin is a golfer but was not invited to golf outings with clients, Mr. Outten said. She also contended in her complaint that the firm had paid for the entertainment of clients at strip clubs. But in its response to the commission, Morgan Stanley said that ''entertainment at topless bars was at most infrequent.''</p>
        <p>The commission also based its decision on information supplied by several other women who had worked at Morgan Stanley. Two women who worked in the same division as Ms. Schieffelin and now work at other investment banks corroborated her contentions in sworn statements, Mr. Outten said. He would not identify those women.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schieffelin filed her complaint with the commission after she was passed over for promotion as managing director in 1997. Since then, she has been passed over twice, Mr. Outten said. He said her year-end bonus for 1999 was substantial but ''we believe that her bonus could have and should have been higher'' and was adversely affected by the fact that she is a woman and she filed this charge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Outten said that going public with her complaint had had a harsh effect on Ms. Schieffelin's relationship with the firm and her co-workers. She has felt shunned and has been excluded from some extracurricular roles, including the recruiting  of prospective employees and helping develop an online system for marketing new securities, known as an electronic roadshow.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schieffelin, 39, has declined to comment publicly on her case because Morgan Stanley's lawyers have warned that she could be disciplined or fired for talking to the news media without permission, Mr. Outten said. Mr. O'Rourke confirmed that Ms. Schieffelin would be violating the firm's policy if she talked about her case.</p>
