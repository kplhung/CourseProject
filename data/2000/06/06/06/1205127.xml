        <p>How is the Sun like the ocean? As predicted by theoreticians, the Sun's surface is pockmarked by a grid of short hills that are similar to long-lived, slow-moving bumps that travel across the Earth's oceans.</p>
        <p>The observation of the tiny solar bulges, each just about 100 yards tall and separated from the next by about 55,000 miles, could provide solar physicists a new tool for examining the inside of the Sun.</p>
        <p>''What we see is, Everywhere on the edge of the Sun are bumps that are carried by solar rotation,'' said Dr. Jeffrey R. Kuhn of the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy, lead author of a paper describing the solar hills in the current issue of the journal Nature.</p>
        <p>The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, from its round-the-clock Sun-watching position about a million miles from Earth, traces the outline of the Sun every 12 minutes. The hills, known as Rossby waves, are too small to be seen in any single outline, but statistical patterns of undulations emerged as Dr. Kuhn's team studied almost three years of data.</p>
        <p>''I think this is an impressive feat, what they've done,'' said Dr. Charles L. Wolff, a scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who has worked out theoretical calculations of Rossby waves on the Sun. ''It's the equivalent of standing in New York and detecting the thickness of a nickel in Los Angeles.''</p>
        <p>Until now, Dr. Wolff said, there have been only indirect and inconclusive evidence for Rossby waves through sunspot observations.</p>
        <p>The hill patterns linger, despite other more violent roilings on the Sun like coronal mass ejections and solar flares.</p>
        <p>''They seem to live for years,'' Dr. Kuhn said. ''We see the features persist even as the pattern of sunspots comes and goes.''</p>
        <p>What creates the hills is the Sun's spin, the same phenomenon that causes the swirling structure in hurricanes, ocean currents and any other fluid on a spinning sphere.</p>
        <p>''It's like an alternating series of high and low pressure systems covering the whole surface of the Sun like a checkerboard,'' Dr. Wolff said. ''That entire pattern drifts slowly westward.''</p>
        <p>The high-pressure regions bulge outward slightly, producing the hills. Oceanographers have detected similar patterns in ocean-height measurements by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Topex/Poseidon satellite. The watery version of Rossby waves are only a few inches high and are separated from each other by about 1,000 miles.</p>
        <p>''They take something like 15 to 20 years to propagate from San Francisco to Tokyo,'' said Dr. Dudley B. Chelton, professor of oceanography at Oregon State University and a co-author of a 1996 article in the journal Science that first discussed the Rossby waves in the Topex/Poseidon images.</p>
        <p>However, in midlatitude regions, the slow pace of the ocean Rossby waves is still twice as fast as what was predicted by the equations of the meteorologist Carl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby, who devised them in the 1930's to describe swirling weather patterns.</p>
        <p>Dr. Roland A. De Szoeke, a colleague of Dr. Chelton at Oregon State, has been tweaking the equations to explain the faster-than-expected Rossby waves. The speed of the waves depends on the density of the fluid, Dr. De Szoeke said, and at the midlatitudes, the thermocline -- the boundary between the warm surface waters and the cold, denser waters below -- runs deeper than in the tropics. In turn, Rossby waves alter the water temperature and density, pushing the thermocline downward by several hundred feet.</p>
        <p>For oceanographers, the Rossby waves don't tell them anything new about ocean conditions. They can directly measure temperature and density directly by dropping probes into the water. Solar scientists who do not have that luxury may be able to use Rossby waves to deduce something about what is going on inside the Sun. Why are the hills 100 yards tall? Why are they 50,000 miles apart?</p>
        <p>''The first puzzle is what determines those numbers,'' Dr. Kuhn said, ''and that is undoubtedly going to be determined by the interior conditions of the Sun.''</p>
