        <p>THE HOUSE</p>
        <p>ENDORSEMENTS WITHDRAWN -- The Teamsters union has withdrawn its endorsement of two Democratic House members -- Lois Capps of California and Tom Sawyer of Ohio -- because they supported the China trade bill. The move could undercut labor's push to help Democrats regain control of the House. But Bret Caldwell, a Teamsters spokesman, said the 1.4-million-member union, one of the largest in the A.F.L.-C.I.O., was more concerned about ''whether members of Congress will stand up when it counts for working families.''</p>
        <p>The endorsement withdrawals were part of a reassessment of all 73 House Democrats who backed the China bill. Other House Democrats who face a strong chance of losing the Teamsters' endorsement, Mr. Caldwell said, include Martin T. Meehan and Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, Tom Allen of Maine, Sander M. Levin of Michigan and Dennis Moore of Kansas. The Teamsters and the United Auto Workers, which also opposed the trade deal, are by far the strongest unions in Mr. Moore's district, which he won by a razor-thin margin in 1998.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>PRIMARIES IN 5 STATES -- Five states hold the last of the presidential primaries today, their role about as useful to politics as the appendix is to people, thanks to the big rush this year by many states to hold early primaries. The five states are Alabama, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota. While some of today's contests, notably the Senate primaries in New Jersey, are expected to draw voters, there is not likely to be a lot of enthusiasm for casting a Bush or Gore vote at this late juncture. That was the case two weeks ago in the Kentucky primary, where the turnout was just 14 percent of enrolled Democrats and 11 percent of Republicans.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>GORE BYPASSES TEXAS -- Last week, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas decided to skip his state's Republican convention because he is so far ahead in presidential preference polls there. Now Vice President Al Gore most likely will bypass the Texas Democratic Party's state convention for, well, the same reason. Texas is going to be ''difficult'' for Mr. Gore in the fall, so he probably will not show for the June 9-10 gathering, the state's Democratic leader, Molly Beth Malcolm, told The Dallas Morning News recently. ''It makes more sense,'' she said, ''that he would go to one of those states where possibly he has a real shot at winning.''</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>HITTING GORE WHERE HE LIVES -- Republicans and officials with the Bush campaign have an insatiable appetite for making fun of Vice President Al Gore's retoolings, restylings and resolves to make sure that voters get to know him better, and today they bit into some fresh meat. A Bush campaign official, speaking to reporters in Austin, Tex., said one of the states in which the Democratic National Committee had investigated the cost and availability of air time for biographical television commercials about Mr. Gore was Tennessee. There's a certain poetry to this, the official said. They're going to put a bio ad on in Tennessee to reintroduce him to all of those hometown people who have grown distant to him over the years.</p>
        <p>The official conceded that some states on the list may be there to divert attention from the real targets, and Jenny Backus, a spokeswoman for the D.N.C., said the committee had not made ''a final decision as to when we will go up, where we will go up, and what we will go up with.''</p>

        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>NADER CHOOSES RUNNING MATE -- Ralph Nader said over the weekend that if he won the presidential nomination of the Green Party, as is expected, he wanted an American Indian activist, Winona LaDuke, on the ballot as the party's candidate for vice president. Ms. LaDuke is a Harvard graduate from the White Earth Indian Reservation in northwestern Minnesota, where she farms and writes, and was Mr. Nader's running mate four years ago. Ten years ago, she started the White Earth Land Recovery Project, an effort to win back lands taken from Minnesota's Objibwa tribe. The Green Party holds its convention later this month.</p>
