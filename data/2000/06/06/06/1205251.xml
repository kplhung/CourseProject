        <p>The articles on end-of-life decisions point up the need for family physicians who know patients, their families, their wishes, and who maintain continuity throughout all their illnesses (May 29 and 30).</p>
        <p>Despite advances in training specialists in family medicine and internal medicine (which definitely includes death and dying), the H.M.O. system, Medicare and patients themselves -- while claiming to value these physicians -- have used them for triage, discouraging their participation in concurrent care.

        <p>The articles on end-of-life decisions point up the need for family physicians who know patients, their families, their wishes, and who maintain continuity throughout all their illnesses (May 29 and 30).</p>
        <p>Despite advances in training specialists in family medicine and internal medicine (which definitely includes death and dying), the H.M.O. system, Medicare and patients themselves -- while claiming to value these physicians -- have used them for triage, discouraging their participation in concurrent care. Patients are handed off to subspecialists who, though competent, have scant sense of the patients' longitudinal history.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it will take increasing pain on the part of families to restore the demand for the family physician to assume a crucial role in the medical supervision of all patients, especially at life's end.</p>
