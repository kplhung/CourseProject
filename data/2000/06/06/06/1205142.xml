        <p>Now, this was more like it. After the spectacular production problems of the Ornette Coleman concert last week -- ending in generator noises, searing lights on the crowd and an aborted show for a pneumatic ticket price -- the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival appeased its audience on Sunday night. It presented an outdoor concert on the beautifully symmetrical, acoustically reasonable south lawn of the Columbia University campus, headlined by Max Roach and Cecil Taylor, that went a long way toward redefining what such events can achieve.</p>
        <p>At 76 and 71, Mr. Roach and Mr. Taylor oversee their own batteries of phrases, identification marks that run through 50 years of their working lives. They are phrases with flavor, short reports alternating emphatic strong and weak beats. It was the rhythmic parallels of those phrases that brought Mr. Roach and Mr. Taylor together again so effectively in a duet. (They played together at Columbia in 1979 and at Town Hall in 1989.)</p>

        <p>Now, this was more like it. After the spectacular production problems of the Ornette Coleman concert last week -- ending in generator noises, searing lights on the crowd and an aborted show for a pneumatic ticket price -- the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival appeased its audience on Sunday night. It presented an outdoor concert on the beautifully symmetrical, acoustically reasonable south lawn of the Columbia University campus, headlined by Max Roach and Cecil Taylor, that went a long way toward redefining what such events can achieve.</p>
        <p>At 76 and 71, Mr. Roach and Mr. Taylor oversee their own batteries of phrases, identification marks that run through 50 years of their working lives. They are phrases with flavor, short reports alternating emphatic strong and weak beats. It was the rhythmic parallels of those phrases that brought Mr. Roach and Mr. Taylor together again so effectively in a duet. (They played together at Columbia in 1979 and at Town Hall in 1989.)</p>
        <p>Despite whatever else the deeply original Mr. Taylor has absorbed and applied to music -- ballet, Ellington, modern classical music -- he listened closely to bebop as a young musician. Underneath the hailstorms-on-the-keyboard, shifting-tonality method he became famous for, there are little rhythmic encodings similar to those with which Mr. Roach helped overturn jazz drumming in the 1940's.</p>
        <p>Try to forget ''free improvisation,'' except as the most generic of brand names; this was a case of two highly defined languages finding common areas through rhythm.  From the beginning there was focus.  Mr. Roach zeroed in on the central region of his kit -- his toms, snare drum and high-hat -- and began carefully, playing slow combinations, never resorting to standard patterns of jazz other than ones he invented, grounding the music in patterns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor began at a medium-high energy level, mimicking the bending notes of the blues and folding them into fast chording that landed in one tonal area for an exhilarating minute and then leapt elsewhere by rabbit reflexes. For exactly one hour it was a similar level of give and take: rhythmically bending toward each other, they kept consistent, drawing the audience into silent concentration.</p>
        <p>At the end of an hour, Mr. Taylor grew rhapsodic, playing sets of exquisite rolling chords that began percussively and ended with rustling softness. Finally, signaling the end, he started from the center of the keyboard, heaved both hands in opposite directions and returned to play a few notes around middle C.  After a pause, short, meditative solo pieces from each musician followed, Mr. Roach's built between a slow one-two of the bass drum and high-hat, Mr. Taylor's like an abstracted Ellington ballad. Mr. Roach called for a moment of silence to honor Tito Puente, and they came back as a duo for 10 more minutes of interplay.</p>
        <p>Also on the evening's long bill was the David S. Ware quartet, which played its gospel-infused jazz at rock-band dynamics, glorifying the extended solo as an agent of visceral transformation. Music does depend on context, and perhaps jazz in New York suffers from basically having only one, the small club catering to the middle-aged patron with spending money. So performing to a few thousand young people in the open air presented a challenge, and this band rose to it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ware's sirenlike tone was at its best, but it was the rhythm section that made it all work. Guillermo Brown's drumming may have been overbearing in a club, but outside it worked perfectly. William Parker, on bass, played in and around Matthew Shipp's piano harmonies: sometimes he was behind the rhythm, sometimes ahead, but from start to finish he pickaxed his way through the music. In one solo, highly miked through enormous speakers, Mr. Parker tested the audience's mettle with string screeches that made even the faithful wince. But the band had already proved itself to the audience, and this concert -- free, full of the curious, and a few thousand strong -- had such good will going for it that it seemed nothing could spoil it.</p>
