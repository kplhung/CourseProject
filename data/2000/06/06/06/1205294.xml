        <p>In a climate of rising investment in the expanding Long Island wine industry, two wineries have been put up for sale. The owners are seeking a total of $9 million.</p>
        <p>The asking price for Gristina Vineyards is $5.5 million, and Bidwell Vineyards is seeking $3.5 million, Dr. Jerry Gristina and Bob Bidwell, the respective owners, said yesterday. Both estates are in Cutchogue, the heart of North Fork wine country.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gristina, a physician, said that he had already fielded inquiries, and Mr. Bidwell said that the market was right for a sale. ''Years ago, when wineries were changing hands, it was because they were failing,'' Mr. Bidwell said. ''Now they're changing because people think the time is right.''</p>
        <p>Of Gristina's 87 acres, 30 are under vines. One tract, designated Andy's Field, has been yielding exceptional chardonnay, merlot and cabernet sauvignon. The winery was established in 1983. Bidwell, which was begun in 1982 and opened a new tasting center in 1996, has 27 of 33 acres planted. Of these, 9.5 are devoted to riesling and 5 to sauvignon blanc.</p>
        <p>Bedell Cellars in Cutchogue was purchased last year for $5 million by Michael Lynne, the president of Time Warner's New Line Cinema. It was the highest price paid for a wine property since the founding of the local wine industry by Hargrave Vineyard in 1973.</p>
