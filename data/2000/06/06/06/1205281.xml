        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The new strategic view underlying the proposed national missile defense by the Clinton administration (''Troubling the Waters of Nuclear Deterrence,'' Week in Review, June 4) appears rooted in a spurious and simplistic dichotomy of rational and irrational, ''civilized'' and ''irresponsible'' nation-states.</p>
        <p>In dropping atom bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II, America thought it was acting rationally, saving thousands of its future casualties. But in retrospect, this decision appears to have been less than responsible, especially in letting the nuclear genie out of the bottle forever.  History attests that irrationality is not reserved for rogue states alone.</p>
