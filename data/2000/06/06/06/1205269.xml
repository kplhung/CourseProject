        <p>Instead of resting before next week's United States Open, many of the world's top golfers have come to New York.</p>
        <p>That is good news for the Buick Classic, which begins Thursday at Westchester Country Club. Six of the top 10 players in the world ranking will compete -- David Duval, Davis Love III, Phil Mickelson, Vijay Singh, Ernie Els and Jesper Parnevik -- giving the tournament one of its strongest fields ever. Other recognizable names in the field include Tom Lehman, Jim Furyk, Sergio Garcia, Paul Azinger, Fred Couples, Steve Elkington, Greg Norman, Jose Maria Olazabal, Craig Stadler, Bob Tway and the defending champion, Duffy Waldorf.</p>

        <p>Instead of resting before next week's United States Open, many of the world's top golfers have come to New York.</p>
        <p>That is good news for the Buick Classic, which begins Thursday at Westchester Country Club. Six of the top 10 players in the world ranking will compete -- David Duval, Davis Love III, Phil Mickelson, Vijay Singh, Ernie Els and Jesper Parnevik -- giving the tournament one of its strongest fields ever. Other recognizable names in the field include Tom Lehman, Jim Furyk, Sergio Garcia, Paul Azinger, Fred Couples, Steve Elkington, Greg Norman, Jose Maria Olazabal, Craig Stadler, Bob Tway and the defending champion, Duffy Waldorf.</p>
        <p>But golf's most renowned player will be missing. Tiger Woods, the world's No. 1 player, is following his usual routine of taking the week off before a major championship.</p>
        <p>With the United States Open beginning June 15 in Pebble Beach, Calif., players had an interesting decision to make. Should they skip the Buick Classic this week, practice at home, then head to Pebble Beach early to prepare for the Open? Or should they play the Buick Classic, a tournament on a challenging, traditional course, hoping for a strong week that would build confidence and momentum heading into the Open?</p>
        <p>Fortunately for the Buick Classic, many top players decided to play.</p>
        <p>''It's a good golf course, and I'm sure they'll try to get the greens firm, the way we'll probably see them next week at Pebble Beach,'' said Olazabal, who spent part of today practicing on the putting green with Garcia and Miguel Angel Jimenez. ''This is a good way to prepare for the Open, but I'm not thinking about next week yet. I'm concentrating on playing well this week.''</p>
        <p>For Europeans like Olazabal, who is from Spain, stopping in New York was a nice way to break up the long trip to the West Coast. Other players, like Duval, simply enjoy coming to Westchester Country Club.</p>
        <p>''I like the golf course, and having to travel out to Pebble Beach after it's over won't be a problem,'' Duval said recently. ''Most guys will still get out to California by Sunday night. And you don't want to overpractice once you get out to the Open anyway. If you play 18 holes for three or four days at Pebble Beach, you might be worn out before the tournament starts.''</p>
        <p>Last year's Buick Classic, held the week after the United States Open in Pinehurst, N.C., did not attract a field as strong this one. This will be Mickelson's first appearance at Westchester since 1993. Norman has not played Westchester since 1996. Garcia, Love and Parnevik did not play last year.</p>
        <p>''The field is strong, and I'm looking forward to a good week,'' Olazabal said. ''You'll need to bring every part of your game to win here.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Practice rounds will be held Tuesday and Wednesday, followed by the tournament Thursday through Sunday. Tickets and information are available by calling (800) 765-4742. . . . The Metropolitan Golf Writers Association held its 49th national awards dinner Monday night in Tarrytown, N.Y. Among those honored were BARBARA NICKLAUS, wife of JACK NICKLAUS, who received the Winnie Palmer award for giving time, energy and enthusiasm to those less fortunate. JULI INKSTER, an L.P.G.A. Hall of Famer, also received the Golden Tee award.</p>
