        <p>In a lawsuit that legal experts say may have broad implications for all Internet search engines, a music Web site has sued the recording industry to retain the ability to link to music files even though some of the works may be pirated material.</p>
        <p>The suit, filed late Friday in Federal District Court in San Jose, brings to a boil a simmering dispute between MP3Board.com Inc., a 12-employee music search engine in Santa Cruz, Calif., and the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the major record labels.</p>
        <p>MP3Board.com runs a search engine focused on finding MP3 files. The company's lawsuit asked Judge Ronald M. Whyte to declare that MP3Board.com should not be held liable for copyright infringement if it provided results of an automated search that might include pirated copyrighted works.</p>
        <p>The Recording Industry Association of America, which has complained to MP3Board.com, says that results of its searches turn up hundreds of links to pirated songs.</p>
        <p>Hilary Rosen, the president of the association, said in an interview on Monday that the Web site is abetting music pirates by aggressively pointing people to copyrighted music. On May 25, the association sent a cease-and-desist letter to MP3board.com, saying that if the site was not disabled by June 2, or all of the offending links removed, then the association would consider taking additional legal action.</p>
        <p>Legal experts say the case has profound implications because the association is seeking to hold MP3board.com liable for linking to copyrighted material produced during an automated Web search. If the court embraces that reasoning, search engines in general could find themselves liable for providing such links whether to music, literature, movies or other works -- said Mark F. Radcliffe, a copyright lawyer with the Palo Alto, Calif., law firm of Gray Cary Ware &amp; Freidenrich.</p>
        <p>''This is right in the back yard of the major search engines, and if the decision goes the wrong way it's going to affect Yahoo and Excite@home very directly,'' Mr. Radcliffe said, adding the case touches on issues copyright lawyers have been struggling with. ''It goes right to the heart of the way the Web works.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosen declined to discuss whether her group considered MP3board.com similar to other search engines, or whether the efforts to pursue the actions of MP3board.com had implications for other search engines. ''I'm not going to put our legal theories'' in the newspaper, she said.</p>
        <p>Lars Mapstead, chief executive of MP3board.com, said his company kept an index of roughly 500,000 songs its automated search engine has culled from the Web. He said it would be prohibitive to go through every link provided by an automated search engine and determine whether or not it was a pirated work. ''I would literally have to listen to every song,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said that activity is no different than other search engines, except with a different focus, and he said that he suspects that the industry association was going after his company because it was small and did not have deep pockets like bigger search engines.</p>
        <p>Copyright experts and the entertainment industry are already struggling with the issue of linking and providing access to pirated copyrighted works. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 provides some ''safe harbor'' provisions that prevent search engines and Internet service providers from being held liable for some content posted on their services, but not all the provisions have been tested or refined in court. In a case that touches on some of the same issues, the movie industry has sought to prevent a Web site, ''2600: The Hacker Quarterly,'' from posting links to other sites that offer software that allows users to copy DVD movies.</p>
        <p>Ira P. Rothken, a lawyer representing MP3Board.com, said that if the association succeeded in taking his client off the Internet for linking to copyrighted material, it could ''lead to paralysis on the Internet because automation would become meaningless.''</p>
        <p>He said the effect could reach much further on the Web. At the major search engines, he said, ''a human being would have to go through every single file.''</p>
