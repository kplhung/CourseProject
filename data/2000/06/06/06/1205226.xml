        <p>To fans like the hundreds who have lined up for two days outside an Upper West Side funeral home to mourn Tito Puente, he was ''the Mambo King,'' ''the King of Latin Jazz'' and ''El Rey del Timbal.''  But Mr. Puente, who died Wednesday at 77, was as much a symbol of New York City as the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty.</p>
        <p>From Greenwich Village to the Bronx, Mr. Puente, whose private funeral will be today in Nanuet, N.Y., left behind a legacy of physical landmarks he had transformed: clubs, restaurants, music schools and even street corners.</p>
        <p>HARLEM: He was born at Harlem Hospital, and his family moved frequently, but as a boy in the 1930's he lived at 53 East 110th Street, between Madison and Park Avenues in Spanish Harlem. He took some of his first piano lessons in the back room of the Latin music store Almacenes Hernandez, at Madison Avenue and East 115th Street, from Victoria Hernandez, the store's owner and the sister of Puerto Rico's most important popular composer, Rafael Hernandez, who wrote the island's unofficial anthem, ''Lamento Borincano.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Puente was a teenager in the 1940's, 110th Street and Fifth Avenue was the center of Latin music in New York, a home to performers like Tito Rodriguez, Machito, Jose Curbelo and Mario Bauza. ''It was nothing to see these famous musicians walking down the street,'' said Joe Conzo, a music historian. ''They stopped and had a beer with you, they sat and just had a conversation, they hung out with everyone.''</p>
        <p>On the corner were two Latin clubs, the Park Palace and the Park Plaza, as well as the Boys Club, where young men would form ''conjuntos,'' small Latin bands. Mr. Puente had his own conjunto, and played in the Spanish movie theaters like the Teatro Boriqua on Lexington Avenue near East 107th Street, and Teatro Hispano on Fifth Avenue at East 116th Street. He also played in the clubs of black Harlem, at places like the Apollo Theater on West 125th Street and Seventh Avenue, and the Renaissance Ballroom at West 138th and Seventh Avenue.</p>
        <p>Later in his life, Mr. Puente poured energy into the Harbor Conservatory for the Performing Arts, the division of Boys Harbor in East Harlem, where he helped establish the Latin music department in the 1970's, rehearsing there six or seven times a year and bringing in other performers like Celia Cruz, said Ramon Rodriguez, the conservatory's director.</p>
        <p>Mr. Puente donated his vast store of Latin jazz memorabilia to the conservatory to help create the Raices Latin Music Collection, one of the most important archives of Afro-Caribbean music in America.</p>
        <p>MIDTOWN: It was at the Palladium that Latin music first emerged in the popular culture of the 1950's. Just after it opened in 1949, Machito headed downtown to the club at 1698 Broadway between 53rd and 54th Streets, paving the way into white Manhattan for musicians from the barrio. Mr. Puente was next.</p>
        <p>''The Palladium opened the door,'' Mr. Conzo said, ''and then, suddenly, there was no racism. You had all these Latin clubs, La Conga, the China Doll, and CuBop City. Everybody mingled there with the jazz groups. Charlie Parker was playing with Tito, Tito played at Birdland, they were all interchanging with each other.''</p>
        <p>GREENWICH VILLAGE: In the 1960's, the club promoter Jack Hooke asked Mr. Puente to lead the house band for the ''Salsa Meets Jazz'' series at the Village Gate, at Bleecker and Thompson Streets. At his weekly gigs, he was usually joined by other jazz luminaries, like Dizzy Gillespie and Dexter Gordon. He also frequently played just around the corner at the Blue Note.</p>
        <p>THE BRONX: About 1992, when Willie's Steak House on Westchester Avenue began featuring live Latin jazz, Mr. Puente became a regular. He would dine with his wife or a group of friends, and, when the spirit moved him, he would hop on stage to join the show. ''Musically, he put us on the map,'' said the owner, Kenneth L. Giordani.</p>
        <p>He also frequented Jimmy's Bronx Cafe on Fordham Road, where he held his 76th-birthday party, attended by more than 2,000 friends and fans, including Bill Cosby and Tito Nieves. From the late 1960's until the 1980's, he could also be found playing at clubs like Hipo Campo on Jerome Avenue.</p>
        <p>CITY ISLAND: In recent years, Mr. Puente liked to sit next to the stage beneath the portrait of Ms. Cruz in the grand mural of jazz legends painted on a wall of Tito Puente's Restaurant on City Island, which he opened in 1995 with Oscar Rivera. He would sip a glass of red wine and eat fillet of sole. If he was there on the weekends when a band was playing, he would sit in on percussion. He would happily shake hands and sign autographs, Mr. Rivera said, adding: ''There was such a presence about him that was different from any of the other celebrities you meet, he was always in rhythm, he was always happy. Always in tune, like a fine piano.''</p>
