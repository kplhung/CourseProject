        <p>A day after he angrily confronted a magazine reporter before a Braves game in Atlanta, the reliever John Rocker was demoted to the minor leagues yesterday and fined $5,000.</p>
        <p>Rocker, the Braves' main closer, has struggled on the mound recently, and the team said his performance on the field was responsible for the demotion. But it said the fine was a result of an outburst on Sunday in which he shouted at Jeff Pearlman, a Sports Illustrated reporter who wrote the article last December that quoted Rocker as denigrating gays, welfare mothers, minorities and others. According to Pearlman, the pitcher told him, ''Do you know what I can do to you?'' and ''This isn't over between us.''</p>

        <p>Because of the comments printed in the magazine article, Major League Baseball fined Rocker $20,000 and suspended him for all of spring training and the first four weeks of the season. However, baseball's impartial arbitrator reduced the fine to $500 and the suspension to the first two weeks of the season.</p>
