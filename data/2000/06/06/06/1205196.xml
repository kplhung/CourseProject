        <p>Stock prices were mixed yesterday, as investors paused to reassess their opportunities after last week's big advance.</p>
        <p>Traders said they were encouraged by the price action. Yesterday's activity stood in stark contrast to the eruptions seen for much of the recent past.</p>
        <p>''Back in April and May you would get a 150-point to 200-point rally and give it all back the next day,'' said Ned Collins, head trader at Daiwa Securities America.</p>
        <p>''As far as I am concerned,'' he added, ''it is good that we are treading water. We had such a big move last week that we need to consolidate some.''</p>
        <p>Led by Hewlett-Packard, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,815.30. But the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.63 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,467.63, attributed in part to declines in General Electric, Cisco Systems and Wells Fargo.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index, which rose a record 19 percent last week, rallied during the last hour of trading yesterday and closed at 3,821.76, up 8.38 points, or 0.2 percent.</p>
        <p>And the Russell 2000 index of small- company stocks also managed to eke out a small gain, rising 0.27 point, to 513.30.</p>
        <p>Stocks jumped last week on reports that showed the economy might be losing some of its momentum, an indication that efforts by the Federal Reserve Board to achieve that end might be working.</p>
        <p>Since last June, the Fed has raised short-term interest rates six times to cool the economy and dampen inflationary pressures.</p>
        <p>The only report of any note this week, however, is the Producer Price Index for May on Friday.</p>
        <p>As a consequence, analysts said stock prices were expected to remain in a trading range for this week, and possibly a good deal longer.</p>
        <p>''To stay in a trading range is probably the best thing that can happen to the market,'' said Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of listed trading at SG Cowen.</p>
        <p>''It gives the people the chance to get into stocks they want to get into, and to sell others at levels they want,'' he said. ''There is no need to panic one way or the other. That is probably helpful, because the market needs to be a little calmer.''</p>
        <p>Trading volume was light, but not abnormally so for a Monday in what Wall Street considers the summer season.</p>
        <p>Some 838 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the Nasdaq stock market was 1.4 billion shares.</p>
        <p>Hewlett-Packard was the Dow's biggest gainer, rising 9 3/8, to 120 3/8.</p>
        <p>Microsoft and I.B.M. also helped to move the Dow higher.</p>
        <p>Microsoft rose 9/16, to 66 7/8, after it said it would spend $2 billion to speed adoption of its new Internet-based software.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. rose 4, to 112 7/16, after a Merrill Lynch analyst expressed optimism about its prospects for the second half of the year.</p>
        <p>But Intel slumped 1 5/8, to 132 9/16, as investors took some profits after last week's big advance. Intel's shares gained 14 percent last week.</p>
        <p>Bank stocks, which have rallied strongly in recent weeks on hopes that an end to interest rate increases by the Fed is near, retreated yesterday.</p>
        <p>Wells Fargo, an S.&amp; P. 500 component, lost 2 3/8, to 45 1/8. Bank of America slid 1 3/4, to 59 1/4. Chase Manhattan lost 13/16, to 79 3/8. And Bank of New York shed 1 3/4, to 46 7/8.</p>
        <p>Biotechnology stocks, which posted very good gains last week, continued to advance.</p>
        <p>Genentech was the biggest winner, rising 19 7/8, to 129, after the drugmaker won approval from the Food and Drug Administration for TNKase, a next-generation version of Activase, a clot-busting drug for heart attack patients.</p>
        <p>Human Genome Sciences rose 7 9/16, to 113 1/2. And PE Corp Celera jumped 22 1/2, to 91.</p>
        <p>''I was expecting some retrenchment in the biotech sector, and it didn't happen,'' said Mike Weiner, a managing director at BancOne Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. ''The follow-through in those stocks surprised me, and it probably masked some weakness in the Nasdaq.''</p>
