        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a surgeon and co-chairman of a hospital ethics committee, I have found that even with clear advanced directives for the terminally ill, the correct course of action is not always clear-cut (''Charting a Course of Comfort and Treatment at the End of Life,'' May 30).</p>
        <p>If a patient with a do-not-resuscitate order agrees to surgery, the order is usually rescinded for at least 24 hours because most doctors are not willing to perform an invasive procedure if they are then unable to resuscitate a patient in the event the heart stops because of the procedure or anesthesia.</p>

        <p>If a patient with a do-not-resuscitate order agrees to surgery, the order is usually rescinded for at least 24 hours because most doctors are not willing to perform an invasive procedure if they are then unable to resuscitate a patient in the event the heart stops because of the procedure or anesthesia.</p>
        <p>When a patient's condition suddenly deteriorates soon after surgery, it is difficult to differentiate between the patient's natural course and a surgical complication, with the different ethical and legal issues involved.</p>
        <p>Doctors should be sure to discuss with patients and families the implications and circumstances of advanced directives in the context of the immediate postoperative period.</p>
