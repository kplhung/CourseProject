        <p>The Federal Communications Commission approved AT&amp;T's acquisition of MediaOne today after ordering the companies to sell some of their assets, clearing the final obstacle to a merger that will create the nation's largest provider of cable television, long-distance telephone service and high-speed Internet access.</p>
        <p>The deal is a prime example of the consolidation that began in the telecommunications market after it was deregulated in 1996, a development that has promised to blur and redefine the nation's telephone, cable and broadcast industries.</p>
        <p>C. Michael Armstrong, AT&amp;T's chairman and chief executive since 1997, has been trying to move his company away from a stagnant business -- long-distance telephone service -- so it can take advantage of the revolution in digital communications. He has committed billions of dollars to offer consumers a basket of services: television; the Internet; and local, long-distance and wireless telephone access.</p>
        <p>But there are limits. The F.C.C. gave the companies a choice of which programming and cable subsidiaries and investments to sell to comply with a rule that forbids a corporation from having interests in more than 30 percent of the nation's cable and satellite television market, or nearly 25 million subscribers. Officials estimate that without any divestitures AT&amp;T and MediaOne would control more than 40 percent of that market, reaching more than 34 million subscribers.</p>
        <p>The decision angered some consumer groups, which had asked the commission to force AT&amp;T to sell the cable systems the company co-owns with Time Warner, its next-biggest rival, which is being acquired by America Online. The groups had also asked the agency to force AT&amp;T to open its Internet network to competing service providers without requiring consumers to pay additional fees.</p>
        <p>Officials at Consumers Union said they were so troubled by the decision that they would file a lawsuit in federal court to overturn the commission's action and would ask Congress to adopt a law that would narrow the agency's authority to review mergers.</p>
        <p>''Rather than use its merger authority to protect the public against an expanding monopoly, the commission has allowed AT&amp;T to extend the reach of its cable and broadband Internet service monopolies and extended the time during which it can abuse consumers and harm potential competitors,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union's Washington office. ''This decision is so inconsistent with the commission's own factual depiction of AT&amp;T's market dominance that it defies logic.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimmelman added that the decision ''smacks of political favoritism for one company.''</p>
        <p>But federal regulators said the order struck a delicate balance by encouraging AT&amp;T and MediaOne to continue investing billions of dollars to upgrade the nation's cable system for high-speed Internet access and entering local telephone markets to challenge the regional Bell companies. At the same time, they said, the order prevents the company from monopolizing the cable market and creating inappropriate bottlenecks for rivals.</p>
        <p>''AT&amp;T's application, as originally filed, was inconsistent with the public interest and presented significant diversity and competition concerns,'' said William E. Kennard, chairman of the F.C.C. ''But the merger we approve today looks very different from the application initially presented to us. This decision strikes the appropriate balance between promoting competition in local telephone service and protecting competition in cable and high-speed Internet service.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard said he had also relied on AT&amp;T's nonbinding commitment not to block access of its system to rivals, as Time Warner did briefly during a recent contract dispute with ABC.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T executives were thrilled by today's decision.</p>
        <p>''This merger will mean a real choice and lower prices in local phone service, faster Internet access and better cable TV,'' Mr. Armstrong said. ''For consumers, that's a home run in any ballpark.''</p>
        <p>The proposed merger was valued at $58 billion when it was announced a year ago during a wave of consolidation in the telecommunications and high-speed Internet markets.</p>
        <p>Those deals have posed a particular challenge for antitrust regulators because of the complex interlocking ownership interests between cable operators, programmers and high-speed Internet service providers.</p>
        <p>In many ways, the blurring of lines between content providers and distributors mirrors the technical convergence that is occurring as it is becoming more difficult to distinguish between a telephone service, a television network and an Internet service provider.</p>
        <p>Both AT&amp;T and Time Warner, which will be the nation's second-largest cable operator, have shared interests in the same high-speed Internet and programming companies. But two weeks ago the Justice Department's antitrust division approved the AT&amp;T merger after the companies agreed to sell their interest in Road Runner, the nation's second-largest cable Internet service.</p>
        <p>Today, the F.C.C. went further, ordering another round of divestitures to comply with a law that says the agency will approve only those mergers that are found to be in the public interest.</p>
        <p>The F.C.C. decided to give AT&amp;T and MediaOne a year to choose from three options to meet the 30 percent limit. The combined company can sell its interest in the Liberty Media Group and Rainbow Holdings, programming companies that AT&amp;T acquired interests in when it acquired Tele-Communications Inc. last year. It can sell MediaOne's 25 percent interest in Time Warner Entertainment, a programming and cable operating company that serves 12.6 million cable subscribers.</p>
        <p>Or AT&amp;T and MediaOne, which together have interests in 41.8 percent of the cable and satellite television markets, could shed 11.8 percent, or about 9.7 million subscribers, to lower the share of the market to 30 percent.</p>
        <p>The order gives the companies until May 19, 2001, to complete the divestitures. The date is the one-year anniversary of a decision by a federal appeals court here upholding the constitutionality of the cable ownership limits. The agency also ordered AT&amp;T to report on what companies they intend to sell within six months of the date of the closing of the merger.</p>
        <p>James Cicconi, AT&amp;T's general counsel, said the company had not decided what it would sell but that it had no intention of spinning off its interest in Liberty Media. That unit's largest shareholder, John C. Malone, is also AT&amp;T's largest shareholder and a member of its board.</p>
        <p>''I'm not prepared to pick an option today,'' Mr. Cicconi said. ''We're confident we can comply.'' He said AT&amp;T planned to close the deal by the first week in August.</p>
        <p>But consumer groups and rivals said that once the deal closed, it would solidify AT&amp;T's position as the dominant cable player. They said that the F.C.C. appeared to have caved in to special interests and that the regulators should have used the deal to force the companies to open their Internet network to competing service providers.</p>
        <p>''In its approval, the F.C.C. indicates that it will continue to monitor AT&amp;T's promise to provide open access in the future,'' said Greg Simon, the co-director of the Open Net Coalition, a group of consumer organizations, Internet providers and other telephone companies that have been critical of AT&amp;T's refusal to provide them with equal access to its high-speed service. ''However, by the time the F.C.C. determines if AT&amp;T has fulfilled its vague voluntary commitments on open access, it may be too late to offer customers meaningful choices for cable Internet services.''</p>
