        <p>The Thomson Corporation, which is selling most of its newspapers to focus on the electronic distribution of legal and financial information, agreed today to buy the Primark Corporation for $842 million.</p>
        <p>Thomson will pay $38 a share for Primark, a rival provider of financial data based in Waltham, Mass., a 31 percent premium to Primark's stock price of $29 on Friday. Thomson will also assume $235 million in debt. Shares of Primark rose $8.25 today, to $37.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. Thomson fell 1.80 Canadian dollars in Toronto, to 49.20 Canadian dollars, or $33.32.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Thomson has spent more than $2 billion to buy database publishers. Its largest division -- legal and regulatory, including the West Group and its Westlaw online research service -- is followed by Thomson Financial. Two other divisions provide research for science and health care professionals and for education.</p>
        <p>Like Thomson, Primark has been focusing on electronic services and has just completed the sale of a subsidiary, the Yankee Research Group, to the Reuters Group for $72.2 million in cash. The company said the proceeds would be used to reduce debt and expand in electronic services.</p>
        <p>With the most recent deal, Thomson will add Primark's IBES International unit, which compiles analysts' forecasts, to its First Call/ Thomson Financial unit, which does similar work. Thomson Financial's other services are used by securities dealers and institutional investors for research, trading and settling transactions. It owns Securities Data, the Electronic Settlements Group and American Banker. The combined Thomson Financial and Primark, which will also bolster Thomson's presence in Europe, will have about $2 billion a year in revenue.</p>
        <p>Joseph Kasputys, the chairman and chief executive of Primark, will become chairman of Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>The boards of both companies have approved the acquisition, which requires that at least 51 percent of Primark's shares be tendered. Thomson said the purchase, which is expected to close in the second half of the year, would weaken its earnings per share this year and next.</p>
        <p>Although Thomson had its beginning in newspapers and radio stations in Canada in the 1930's and continues to publish newspapers and specialized periodicals, its business in electronic databases and related services contributed half of its $5.8 billion in revenue last year. The company's chairman, Kenneth Thomson, said recently that electronic data sales should reach 80 percent of the company's total revenue within five years, and half of that could be Internet-related.</p>
        <p>A group of 130 Thomson newspapers in Canada and the United States, with combined annual revenue of $800 million, has been for sale since February, and could be sold before the end of the year. Analysts think the newspapers could sell for as much as $2.5 billion. Thomson is keeping its flagship Toronto paper, The Globe and Mail.</p>
        <p>The market has become cluttered, however, because late in April, Hollinger of Toronto, controlled by Conrad Black, put a for-sale sign on all but the biggest of its 77 daily newspapers and 302 other publications in Canada and the United States.</p>
        <p>While Thomson's head office is in Toronto, its executive offices are in Stamford, Conn., and four-fifths of its revenue comes from doing business in the United States.</p>
