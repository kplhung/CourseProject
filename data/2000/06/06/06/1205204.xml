        <p>A deep division within the nation's largest Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention, has developed to the point that a significant moderate minority has been creating a separate existence from the denomination's increasingly conservative leadership.</p>
        <p>Reluctant to accept the conservatives' insistence that the Bible be interpreted literally and that women submit to their husbands and be barred from serving as pastors, the moderates have set up seminaries and a religious publishing house.</p>
        <p>They have also sent out their own missionaries and created separate associations of congregations, like the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, which by itself counts 1,800 churches as contributors to its budget.</p>
        <p>One of those is First Baptist Church, which covers a city block here and whose members over the last century have donated considerable time and money to the convention's causes, said its pastor, the Rev. David Hughes.</p>
        <p>But these days, Mr. Hughes likens the relationship between church and denomination to a marriage gone sour. The two are like a couple that ''still live under one roof, but they have very little to do with each other,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The president of the Southern Baptist Convention, the Rev. Paige Patterson, acknowledged that moderates had ''formed a denomination within the denomination.'' Mr. Patterson said he would not be surprised if 1,500 or more moderate congregations were to leave the convention in the coming years out of the more than 40,000 total congregations that belong.</p>
        <p>But they would quickly be replaced, he said, adding that the denomination started 1,479 new churches in 1999 and that its increasingly conservative stance had been attracting established congregations as new members, like the Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Va., where the Rev. Jerry Falwell is pastor. ''We're gaining, not losing,'' Mr. Patterson said.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line,'' he added, ''is anytime you take a stand and define yourself very clearly -- and in this case, returning to the faith of our fathers -- there are people who want to be part of that and join you. And there are people who don't want to part of it, and are going to use their chute and rip cord.''</p>
        <p>Even without the moderates' participation, the convention remains formidable. It operates six seminaries, fields more than 6,000 missionaries and runs one of the world's largest church literature publishing houses. When Southern Baptist leaders speak, politicians and the news media take notice.</p>
        <p>Academic authorities are reluctant to call the rift among Southern Baptists a formal split because no clean break has yet taken place, and many moderates still regard themselves as members of the convention. But the differences are serious and long-lasting, and many on both sides have suggested they could lead to the creation of a separate denomination.</p>
        <p>Should that happen, the Southern Baptists would be finally confirmed in a staunchly conservative identity.</p>
        <p>What the rift also shows is how difficult it can be, at a time when many Protestant church members' loyalties to denominations have weakened, to hold together big church bodies amid divisive issues.</p>
        <p>The situation is particularly acute among Southern Baptists because of how their convention works. Its member churches across the country are autonomous, owning their own property and hiring their own pastors but collaborating for missionary purposes, sending men and women around the world to try to convert people to faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>The formula has been so successful that the denomination long ago spilled outside its home region, the Southeast, and is nearly twice the size of the next-largest Protestant body, the United Methodist Church.</p>
        <p>Bill Leonard, a church historian who is dean of Wake Forest Divinity School, an institution recently established by moderates in Winston-Salem, said the convention was undergoing a fragmentation, particularly since the appearance of rival Baptist organizations in Texas and Virginia.</p>
        <p>But part of the challenge, Mr. Leonard said, arises from a growing tendency among younger Protestants to think of themselves as nondenominational.</p>
        <p>''I can't emphasize enough that among this generation of college students and seminary students, conservative and liberal, their sense of denominational identity is much smaller than previous generations,'' he said, meaning that they think of themselves as Christians, rather than specifically as Baptists or Methodists or Presbyterians.</p>
        <p>Nancy T. Ammerman, a sociologist of religion at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut, said she saw ''an increasing diversity'' within Southern Baptist ranks as different groups found homes inside ''alternative organizations,'' like the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and a smaller group, the Alliance of Baptists.</p>
        <p>Examples of such sentiments can be found among members in a congregation like First Baptist Church in Winston-Salem, affiliated with the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. Phyllis Lile-King, 35, a civil rights lawyer, simply calls herself ''an authentic Baptist'' and says she and others she knows are past feeling the need to actively oppose the conservatives' rule.</p>
        <p>Barbara R. Blackburn, 38, a university professor, said that whenever she moved, she sought out congregations affiliated with the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, like First Baptist.</p>
        <p>Southern Baptist leaders have been taking increasingly conservative positions for years. But in May, a committee of leaders proposed revising the denomination's core statement of beliefs at the annual meeting, on June 12 in Orlando, Fla. The revisions, if adopted at the meeting, would call on Christians to oppose abortion, homosexuality and pornography.</p>
        <p>One clause, among the most controversial, would also firmly state that the Bible does not allow women to be pastors, a largely symbolic move in a denomination where few congregations have hired women for that office. ''While both men and women are gifted for service in the church,'' the proposed revision states, ''the office of pastor is limited to men as qualified by Scripture.''</p>
        <p>One does not have to search far in North Carolina to find Baptist women who concur.</p>
        <p>''I subscribe to that,'' said Cheri Jimenez, 31, a former communications director for the conservative organization Concerned Women for America.</p>
        <p>''This is very controversial and there is enormous complexity to this issue,'' said Ms. Jimenez, a Raleigh resident who helps to run a Christian ministry to women. ''But I just have to stand on Scripture and the authority of that, even though that is not popular at times.''</p>
        <p>Robin Eckerd, 33, a physical therapist in Winston-Salem, agreed. Ms. Eckerd said she saw no Scriptural ban on a woman being a political or business leader. ''If that's where God's directing her, sure,'' she said. ''But I think within the church, within spiritual leadership, it needs to be a man.''</p>
        <p>Southern Baptists became a separate denomination in 1845, when Baptists nationwide split along North-South lines over slavery. Today, Baptists in the United States are divided among several denominations, with Southern Baptists the largest.</p>
        <p>Over the last century and a half, Southern Baptist churches coalesced and flourished in their region, developing a religious way of life as all-encompassing as anything in American Protestantism. Church members could attend services three times a week, belong to church organizations as children, adolescents and adults, study Baptist Sunday School material and choose among colleges and seminaries affiliated with the denomination.</p>
        <p>''It was a total system that connected people to the denomination from birth to death,'' said Mr. Leonard, the Wake Forest dean.</p>
        <p>The denomination thrived, through Reconstruction, the Scopes trial and the Depression, he said, supported by its members' loyalty and the atmosphere of a distinct Southern culture.</p>
        <p>The cultural support began to crumble in 1960's.</p>
        <p>''It was the breakup of the Old South -- the civil rights movement, the immigration of Yankees in and Southerners out,'' said Ms. Ammerman, the sociologist.</p>
        <p>In 1979, a group whose leaders included Mr. Patterson, the current president, succeeded in electing one of their own as the denomination's president, gaining an office whose powers included appointing trustees to oversee the Southern Baptist seminaries, missionary agencies and other boards. The conservatives have preached that the standard of Baptist belief is that the Bible is ''inerrant'' -- literally true in all matters -- and have said that those who serve the denomination ought to subscribe to that.</p>
        <p>After unsuccessfully trying for a decade to wrest control of the presidency away from conservatives at the annual convention, the moderates began founding their own seminaries and ministerial programs in the 1990's. One is the Baptist Studies Program at Candler School of Theology at Emory University in Atlanta, whose graduates include the Rev. Stacey Simpson, 28.</p>
        <p>Baptized in a Southern Baptist congregation, Ms. Simpson attended Furman University in Greenville, S.C., when that institution took steps to distance itself from South Carolina's Baptist organization, dominated by conservatives. At Candler, she was ordained in a liberal-leaning congregation that was eventually expelled from the Baptists' Georgia organization.</p>
        <p>Ms. Simpson serves as pastor of Fellowship Baptist Church, a five-year-old congregation in Edison, Ga., affiliated with the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship.</p>
        <p>''I call myself a Baptist,'' she said, ''and I kind of have to add a bunch of clarifiers after that, when people ask.''</p>
