        <p>Audiences need special concentration to appreciate yesterday's silent films, which rely on visuals that are simple, acting that is broad and soundtracks that emphasize tone.</p>
        <p>Audiences need extra-special concentration to appreciate ''Nosferatu,'' the theater piece now playing at the Here Arts Center and based on a 1922 silent film of the same name.</p>
        <p>The production comes from a Colorado company, Telluride Repertory Theater, and Rene Migliaccio, the play's director and adapter, working from the F. W. Murnau film and Bram Stoker's ''Dracula.'' Mr. Migliaccio describes the production's style as ''expressionistic realism,'' which here means, in part, highly stylized movement from actors whose faces are painted with clown white. Lighting aims for the stark; sound is ambient and techno; and settings involve projected slides of mood-setting Romantic paintings and landscapes.</p>
        <p>''Nosferatu'' is heavy on style, but it is not bereft of ideas. In fact, ideas seem to be shouted from almost every nook and cranny of this production. It aims to evoke the vampire myth through the grandeur of its silent film homage, with an emphasis on good's victory over evil; the resonant final image has Nosferatu's potential victim, Mina (Annie Alquist), standing astride the vanquished title vampire, who lies defeated at her feet.</p>
        <p>Ambition deserves kudos. But ambition alone cannot sustain a production, and the goals of ''Nosferatu'' remain out of reach. The show is ponderous; moments that could be laden with meaning are leaden with earnest but empty silence. And for a production with a cast of 22, its human spectacle is rarely arresting and does little to propel the narrative.</p>
        <p>Expressionism, at its best, externalizes the emotional essence of a work; as performed by the ''Nosferatu'' cast, that essence is externalized and, for the most part, clarified. But it is rarely expressed as a compelling emotional force.</p>
        <p>As Nosferatu, however, Nikolai Kinski takes advantage of his limited opportunities to connect. His initial appearance, when he does nothing more than slowly unfurl his fingers, demands attention. The simple movement has a subtlety and power unrealized in most of the performances.</p>
        <p>The frenzied destruction of Lucy makes good use of the chorus and the physical abandon of Lori Vincent as Lucy. As Harding, Bunzy Bunworth captures his heightened grief with some dimension. Most of the performance, however, manages to underline the obvious while remaining vacuous.</p>
        <p>The production features an original score credited to Amaury Groc, Toidoi and Beru. This sound and music seem well attuned to the material, be it kinetic, lush or blunt, but at times constrain the pace of the narrative. Other technical elements meet with less success, at least as adapted to the space at Here.</p>
        <p>The Telluride Repertory Theater brings evident skills and a thoughtful reach to ''Nosferatu.'' But Mr. Migliaccio has led this production into a Transylvania of surfaces, a landscape of tone without texture. Vampires may be dead, but good theater needs life.</p>
        <p>NOSFERATU</p>
        <p>Directed and adapted from F. W Murnau's ''Nosferatu'' and Bram Stoker's ''Dracula'' by Rene Migliaccio; original score by Amaury Groc and Toidoi and Beru; costumes and sets by Francois Tomsu; lighting by Stephanie Johnson; sound by Mr. Groc; makeup by Andy Grondahl. Presented by the Telluride Repertory Theater and Paul Lucas, in association with the Here Arts Center. At 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village.</p>
        <p>WITH: Nikolai Kinski (Nosferatu), Annie Alquist (Mina), Suzan Beraza (Ellen), James E. Berrier (Renfield), Lori Vincent (Lucy) and Bunzy Bunworth (Harding).</p>
