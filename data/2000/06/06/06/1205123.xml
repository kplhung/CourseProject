        <p>Although he spent the first 17 years of his life on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay, Carl Immel had never set foot in its water. After being jailed on assault and theft charges two years ago, however, the court assigned Mr. Immel to Baltimore's Fresh Start Program, which uses sailing as a therapeutic tool for troubled teenagers. Soon he was racing a 23-foot Rainbow sail boat in Baltimore Harbor.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know a jib from a main sheet,'' said Mr. Immel, now 19, who has since graduated from the program and gotten a job. ''But I loved it the first time I raced, especially being out there away from everything.''</p>

        <p>Although he spent the first 17 years of his life on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay, Carl Immel had never set foot in its water. After being jailed on assault and theft charges two years ago, however, the court assigned Mr. Immel to Baltimore's Fresh Start Program, which uses sailing as a therapeutic tool for troubled teenagers. Soon he was racing a 23-foot Rainbow sail boat in Baltimore Harbor.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know a jib from a main sheet,'' said Mr. Immel, now 19, who has since graduated from the program and gotten a job. ''But I loved it the first time I raced, especially being out there away from everything.''</p>
        <p>Growing up in poor urban neighborhoods is hardly the traditional pedigree for sunset sails, but sailing is now being used to help youths facing abuse, violence and crime.</p>
        <p>''These kids come from tough backgrounds where they have a world of issues and are products of their environment,'' said Parker B. Rockefeller, director of development for Living Classrooms, a nonprofit educational organization in Maryland that runs the Fresh Start program, a learn-by-doing program for students who have trouble with the law. ''When they come off the boats, they have an incredible sense of accomplishment.''</p>
        <p>Sailing is a sport of independence, responsibility, control and direction, the very qualities that are often lacking among youth who have been in trouble, said Carol M. Miller, a child psychologist and member of Sea Sisters, a Maryland group of women who sail. ''I have seen teens,'' she said, ''in whose homes there was no control, no consistency, and no one to trust.''</p>
        <p>Sailing, she said, tackles these issues head on by getting the teenagers off the therapy couch and in control of a boat.</p>
        <p>''The thrill, excitement and high you get from heeling over in a high wind is very attractive to these children who often have a high threshold for stimulation and engage in life-threatening activities on the streets,''  Ms. Miller said.</p>
        <p>It is this thrill that Dawn Riley, captain of America True, a United States entry in the America's Cup race last year, wanted to share. In 1995, she began a nationwide youth sailing program, True Youth, which pairs boat owners with at-risk children, like first-time offenders or victims of abuse.  Having spent much of her childhood on the family sailboat, Ms. Riley, who is from Detroit, appreciates the connection sailing makes with the young people.</p>
        <p>''There is a big clique mentality, but out on the boat, the playing field is level,'' she said. ''It takes a tremendous amount of responsibility because of strong winds and tides and cold water,'' said Paul Sidorenko, vice commodore of Golden Gate Yacht Club in San Francisco, who runs the club's youth sailing program. ''If you don't focus, you can die.''</p>
        <p>At Fresh Start, the young people run the entire ship, a schooner called The Lady Maryland, with staff members there simply to help out. ''Fifteen kids are lined up on the starboard side pulling up this huge, heavy canvas mainsail,'' Mr. Rockefeller said. ''You can't do that without working together.''</p>
        <p>The same self-esteem and competence sailing sometimes imparts to troubled youths from the city can work for the suburban ones, too. A 10-year-old from Arnold, Md., who asked that her name not be used, struggled through her parents' divorce and sought counseling with the Strong Girls program at the Y.M.C.A., which included sailing with the local Women Aboard club. She said that while on the boat, the tension she felt at home began to slip away.</p>
        <p>Her mother noticed the change: ''There was a light I hadn't seen in her eyes for quite a while. The sailing seemed to blow things away and I was just grateful to see it.''</p>
