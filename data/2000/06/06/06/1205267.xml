        <p>Mike Hampton had dirt caked on his left knee, more dirt on his right knee and he was stomping around the mound like an angry pitcher. He had tamed the Baltimore Orioles for six innings, but things suddenly changed in a sloppy seventh and Hampton was desperately trying to keep the Mets ahead.</p>
        <p>But Hampton failed. The Orioles bruised him for three runs in the seventh and defeated the Mets, 4-2, on a blustery night at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>Hampton had throttled Baltimore on one run and five hits and seemed to be cruising toward his fifth consecutive victory, but he could not hold the one-run lead and later blamed some pitch calls for helping the Orioles and changing the complexion of the game.</p>
        <p>See him pitch, see him hit and see him run. That is the Hampton the Mets always wanted, the feisty pitcher who refuses to give in to hitters, who plays like a shortstop and forces anyone watching the game to stare right at him. That is where the action will usually be when Hampton is pitching.</p>
        <p>The action was all around Hampton in the seventh and he could not prevent a game that was his from turning into a game that became Mike Mussina's, ending Hampton's winning streak and Baltimore's five-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>''Let's just say they had 10 weapons tonight and they used all of them,'' said Hampton, obviously referring to Umpire Mike DiMuro's strike zone. ''I'm not going to say anything more about it.''</p>
        <p>Hampton trudged to the mound with a 2-1 lead in the seventh, but he never made it out of the inning. It started unraveling when B. J. Surhoff blasted an 0-1 sinker through the strong winds and over the left-center field fence to tie the game, 2-2.</p>
        <p>Other balls that were hit lost the battle to winds that were blowing straight in, but Hampton said they shifted in the seventh. Still, Surhoff's shot caused Hampton to turn around and ask himself, ''How in the world did that get out?''</p>
        <p>After a single and a forceout, Hampton walked Rich Amaral on a close 3-2 pitch to put runners on first and second. Hampton wound up tumbling to the dirt after ball four because he felt it was a strike and thought his catcher, Mike Piazza, might have to unleash a throw to second to possibly get the runner, Mussina, who was going on the pitch.</p>
        <p>That 3-2 call bothered Hampton and set up the go-ahead run in scoring position.</p>
        <p>''He threw a lot of pitches down in the zone and didn't get any of them,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''There were a lot of swing pitches.''</p>
        <p>When Mike Bordick followed the walk by punching a single to center that knocked in the pinch-runner Delino DeShields to give the Orioles a 3-2 lead, Hampton was so aggravated that he caught Piazza's return throw with his bare left hand.</p>
        <p>Hampton struck out Jeff Conine for the second out and jammed Albert Belle with a fastball for what could have been the third out. But Belle proved strong enough to bloop the ball over first base for a run-scoring double that made it 4-2 and ended Hampton's night.</p>
        <p>Valentine criticized himself for not replacing the weary Hampton, but the pitcher said, ''I had plenty left.''</p>
        <p>Hampton (6-5), who had been 4-0 with a 1.17 earned run average in his past five starts, gave up four earned runs on nine hits and four walks in six and two-thirds innings. Mussina yielded two runs and three hits in the second, but he muzzled the Mets on three hits in five other innings in winning for the third time in 13 starts. After Hampton's infield single in the fourth, his second hit of the game, the Mets did not get a hit for the rest of the game.</p>
        <p>With two outs and no one on in the Mets' second, Melvin Mora bunted for a hit. Normally, it would be unwise for a No. 8 batter to attempt to bunt for a hit. But not when Hampton bats ninth.</p>
        <p>Hampton is not like other pitchers because he is not an automatic out. He smacked a grounder that nicked off a diving Cal Ripken's glove at third and trickled into left-center, allowing Mora to breeze into third. Hampton is 11 for 31 (.355) this season.</p>
        <p>The rookie Jason Tyner, who singled off Mussina's glove in his first major league at-bat, then fell behind by 0-2 after watching ''the best breaking ball I've ever seen.'' But Mussina's next curveball was high and Tyner sliced it to left to put the Mets ahead, 1-0. Mussina walked the next two batters to force in the second run.</p>
        <p>The Orioles countered on Belle's run-scoring single in the third, but Hampton maintained a 2-1 lead and had retired 10 of 11 batters entering the seventh. But Surhoff homered, Hampton said some calls changed things and he finally lost his grip.</p>
        <p>''I felt I was where I needed to be,'' Hampton said. ''The outcome wasn't what I wanted.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Mets chose BILLY TRABER, a 6-foot-4-inch left-hander out of Loyola Marymount University, with the 16th pick in the draft yesterday. The 20-year-old Traber was 10-4 with a 3.13 earned run average and throws a fastball, a curveball and a changeup. ''I don't have a timetable,'' Traber said. ''I want to get there as soon as I can.''</p>
