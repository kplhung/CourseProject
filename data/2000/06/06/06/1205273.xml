        <p>The biggest shot fired by the Dallas Stars this evening did not belong to Joe Nieuwendyk, even though he scored his team's only goal. Nor did it come from the blade of Brett Hull, whose two goals in Game 2 paced the Stars to their only victory thus far in the the Stanley Cup finals. Hull has been conspicuously quiet ever since.</p>
        <p>No, the biggest blow of Game 4 emanated from the forearms, elbows and butt-end of the stick of the Dallas captain, Derian Hatcher, who knocked Jason Arnott out of the game with seven and a half minutes left in the third period. By that time, the Devils were well on their way to a 3-1 victory, putting them one triumph from their second Stanley Cup championship.</p>

        <p>The biggest shot fired by the Dallas Stars this evening did not belong to Joe Nieuwendyk, even though he scored his team's only goal. Nor did it come from the blade of Brett Hull, whose two goals in Game 2 paced the Stars to their only victory thus far in the the Stanley Cup finals. Hull has been conspicuously quiet ever since.</p>
        <p>No, the biggest blow of Game 4 emanated from the forearms, elbows and butt-end of the stick of the Dallas captain, Derian Hatcher, who knocked Jason Arnott out of the game with seven and a half minutes left in the third period. By that time, the Devils were well on their way to a 3-1 victory, putting them one triumph from their second Stanley Cup championship.</p>
        <p>Even Hatcher acknowledged that the unpenalized hit was not legal. Not that the 6-foot-5-inch, 230-pound defenseman was repentant.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if it was the cleanest play, but a lot worse than that goes on during the course of a game, I'll tell you that much,'' Hatcher said in his defense.</p>
        <p>Hatcher's intention was clear. And it wasn't just the manner in which Hatcher delivered the hit, it was to whom the hit was delivered. Arnott has been the Devils' most valuable player of the finals.</p>
        <p>Was it a message? Was it out of frustration, because the Stars were about to lose for the first time in 12 games this postseason when they had entered the third period with the lead? Or was it simply because Arnott, who had just finished taking a shot from the top of the left circle, was standing there?</p>
        <p>''Because he's there,'' Hatcher said. ''I stood up on the guy, got a glove on his face. It happens a lot through the course of the game.''</p>
        <p>Afterward, Hatcher was asked his version of the events.</p>
        <p>''To be honest, I don't know,'' said the defenseman, who is known for his mean streak. ''I hit him; I gave him a glove to the face. Actually, I was surprised he was down on the ice. I hit him with my glove. It happens 20 times a game.''</p>
        <p>But Colin Campbell, the National Hockey League's senior vice president in charge of discipline, was, along with other officials, closely reviewing the incident on videotape.</p>
        <p>''It was a punch, it was not a stick,'' Campbell said. ''All our refs missed it. It probably should have been called a penalty. It's not the kind of play we like.''</p>
        <p>Campbell gave no indication whether discipline would be forthcoming.</p>
        <p>Considering that Game 5 in New Jersey is now Dallas's most crucial game of the season, Hatcher was asked if he was worried that a suspension was looming.</p>
        <p>''No,'' he said with a laugh, before alluding to his reputation. ''Actually, I wouldn't be surprised at all. But from some of the stuff I've seen in the playoffs, I'd be shocked.''</p>
        <p>A New Jersey team physician said after the game that Arnott had not suffered a concussion and that he had been hit in the mouth with the butt end of Hatcher's stick.</p>
        <p>But 39 minutes after the final horn had sounded, Arnott was led from the trainer's room to the showers in the Devils' locker room. Right before he emerged, a team official told reporters to leave the room. Arnott appeared to be groggy and was still wearing his underclothing. When asked if Arnott could be interviewed, reporters were told, ''He's not talking.''</p>
        <p>It was not clear whether Arnott would be ready for Game 5.</p>
        <p>''It definitely should have been a penalty,'' New Jersey Coach Larry Robinson said.</p>
        <p>With his team a game away from elimination, Hatcher made a statement with the hit. The Stars are searching for a spark from somewhere, even from their captain's elbows.</p>
        <p>''I didn't even see it,'' said New Jersey's captain, Scott Stevens, who is used to making statements with his own hits. ''But I kind of figured out after it happened what had probably occurred.''</p>
