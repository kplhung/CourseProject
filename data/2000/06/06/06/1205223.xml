        <p>Last year, the art world was abuzz about elephant dung and a shark in formaldehyde at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. This year, animals are once again capturing artistic attention: a parade of artist-designed cows are posing throughout the city this month, and yesterday, the artist Jeff Koons unveiled a 43-foot puppy sculpture carpeted with living flowers in Rockefeller Center.</p>
        <p>Like the cows, which were a hit in Zurich and Chicago, Mr. Koons's West Highland white terrier is a tried and true crowd pleaser. Mr. Koons first exhibited the sculpture, called ''Puppy,'' during an international art show in 1992 in Germany. The artist had not been invited to participate in the exhibition, ''Documenta IX,'' but ''Puppy'' nonetheless stole the show, and was shown again in Sydney in 1996.</p>

        <p>Last year, the art world was abuzz about elephant dung and a shark in formaldehyde at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. This year, animals are once again capturing artistic attention: a parade of artist-designed cows are posing throughout the city this month, and yesterday, the artist Jeff Koons unveiled a 43-foot puppy sculpture carpeted with living flowers in Rockefeller Center.</p>
        <p>Like the cows, which were a hit in Zurich and Chicago, Mr. Koons's West Highland white terrier is a tried and true crowd pleaser. Mr. Koons first exhibited the sculpture, called ''Puppy,'' during an international art show in 1992 in Germany. The artist had not been invited to participate in the exhibition, ''Documenta IX,'' but ''Puppy'' nonetheless stole the show, and was shown again in Sydney in 1996.</p>
        <p>'' 'Puppy' is one of the most significant sculptures of the 20th century,'' Susan Freedman, the president of the Public Art Fund, told The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>But however bland and friendly its demeanor, ''Puppy'' may not have been, strictly speaking, a safer choice than a shark or elephant dung. In 1997 in Spain, where a second version of the sculpture stands guard outside the Guggenheim Bilbao, two terrorists were caught trying to plant bombs inside the artwork, and a police officer died in the ensuing gunfire.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was the first time ''Puppy'' has been seen in the United States. It will be on view in Rockefeller Plaza, where the Christmas tree stands during the holiday season, until Labor Day. Rockefeller Center paid for the display but refused to disclose the cost, saying it was a gift to the city.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koons is famous for borrowing American kitsch and transforming it into art, presenting knick-knackish puppies, pigs and the Pink Panther in a deadpan manner. In the 80's, his porcelain portrait of Michael Jackson with his pet chimp, Bubbles, was priced at $250,000. More recently, a 1988 sculpture brought $1.8 million at an auction last year at Christie's.</p>
        <p>Eleven stainless-steel sections, each holding 12 inches of dirt, fit together to form the armature of the verdant canine. An internal irrigation system nourishes a varicolored carpet of 60,000 flowering plants, including marigolds, begonias, impatiens, lobelias and 50 kinds of petunias from nurseries on Long Island.</p>
        <p>''It's controlled random,'' Mr. Koons said of the pattern created by the flowers, which will be allowed to grow out naturally. ''It can't be done wrong. It's such a pleasant experience to give up control, to let nature take its course.''</p>
        <p>Already, a lone marigold could be spotted poking up above the puppy's giant left ear. As the summer wears on, observed David Murbach, the director of Rockefeller Center's regular plantings, ''Puppy'' will be one shaggy dog, indeed.</p>
