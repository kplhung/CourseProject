        <p>Responding to the unopposed election of Alberto Fujimori to a third term as president of Peru, foreign ministers at the annual assembly of the Organization of American States agreed tonight to send a mission to Lima to explore options for strengthening democracy in Peru.</p>
        <p>The team is to be led by Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, and Cesar Gaviria, secretary general of the Organization of the American States.</p>
        <p>''The presidential vote in Peru is a matter of deep concern to us all,''  Mr. Axworthy said before the vote. ''Left unexamined, it will certainly diminish the credibility of this organization.''</p>
        <p>The resolution left it up to the mission to decide on a timetable and a forum for its reporting. Many diplomats agreed that the mission would have the most impact if it went to Lima well before Mr. Fujimori's planned inauguration date, July 28.</p>
        <p>Human rights and Peruvian opposition legislators who gathered here today called for new elections, and, failing that, concerted pressure on Mr. Fujimori.</p>
        <p>''It is important to tell Fujimori that we have you under the microscope here; your case is not under a done deal,'' said Jose Miguel Vivanco, a Chilean lawyer who is executive director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, a Washington-based organization. ''If the O.A.S. does not take these minimal steps, the message is the O.A.S.  will only react to confront bloody, unpopular coups.''</p>
        <p>The May 28 runoff in Peru set off a cascade of criticism. Mr. Fujimori ran unopposed because his first-round opponent, Alejandro Toledo, had dropped out, denouncing limits on media coverage and voting irregularities in the first round of the election in April.</p>
        <p>Rights advocates from Peru and North American converged here to pressfor strong action.</p>
        <p>''If this process is legitimized, in the end, other countries will be encourage to follow the bad example of Peru,'' warned Sofia Macher, director of the National Human Rights Coordinate, a coalition of about 60 Peruvian rights groups. Calling President Fujimori's planned inauguration ''a coup d'etat in slow motion,'' she urged other countries to press Peru for ''new elections under new conditions.''</p>
        <p>Defending his government, Fernando de Trazegnies Granda, Peru's foreign minister, cited its battles  with hyperinflation and terrorism in the early 1990's, saying: ''Don't judge us by where we fall short by utopian criteria, but by what we have traveled through.''</p>
        <p>As the delegates debated Peru, another issue -- free trade -- brought 2,500 protesters to the steel fence protecting the meetings, though trade was not on the agenda.  The protests here have been the largest in memory at an O.A.S. gathering.</p>
        <p>Canadian immigration officials at the border crossings from Detroit refused admittance to 560 Americans in the four days before the O.A.S. meeting opened, much higher than the normal rate of refusal of 1,000 a month. Ken Lawrence, a spokesman for the immigration service, said many of ''the individuals were coming in to protest.''</p>
        <p>Danny Yen, a Canadian customs spokesman, said that during the same time at the Detroit crossing, customs officials had confiscated from about 200 Americans hundreds of items that could have been used in protests, including tear gas canisters, gas masks, eye goggles, bleach, pepper spray, pipes, bats and flares.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, 41 protesters were arrested outside the riverfront convention center here, 35 for blocking a bus that carried delegates and several more for attempting to scale the security fence. Sgt. David Rossell of the Windsor police said that officers used pepper spray after protesters  had thrown smoke bombs and unknown liquids at them.</p>
        <p>At the same time, about 400 people paraded in downtown Detroit carrying banners and chanting ''Clean up this mess, stop the O.A.S.''</p>
        <p>Today police officers removed scores of demonstrators who had linked arms and sat in the rain to block delegates in three buses from arriving at an official luncheon.</p>
