        <p>Editorial backs Supreme Court decision striking down Washington State law permitting courts to grant grandparents visiting rights over parent's objections (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Supreme Court has wisely affirmed a ruling by the Washington State Supreme Court that a state statute goes too far in permitting courts to grant grandparents visiting rights over a parent's objections. The case, Troxel v. Granville, raises the question of whether and when states can intrude on parental rights to recognize other family ties. It has been closely watched because family structures are changing, and grandparents and other adults are taking on parental roles.</p>
        <p>All 50 states allow for grandparent visitation in some form. But the Washington law, as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted in her plurality opinion, is ''breathtakingly broad'' in that it allowed ''any person'' at ''any time'' to get visitation rights if the court decided that visitation would ''serve the best interest of the child.'' The court found that the law as applied in this case unconstitutionally infringed on the fundamental parental rights of a mother named Tommie Granville. A state judge ordered that Ms. Granville's daughters be required to visit their paternal grandparents without giving ''special weight'' to Ms. Granville's views. The judge in effect substituted his judgment for hers.</p>

        <p>The court did not set a fixed rule for determining the constitutionality of all visitation statutes. Justice O'Connor said, cautiously, that constitutionality turns on how any standard is applied.</p>
