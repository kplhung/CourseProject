        <p>Vicki Stearn, a spokeswoman in Washington for XM Satellite, part of Motient, -- formerly the American Mobile Satellite Corporation -- said yesterday that the decision came after a four-month review that had been narrowed to two finalists: TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, and the New York office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Another contender, Deutsch Inc. in New York, withdrew from the review in April.</p>
