        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Frances FitzGerald (Op-Ed, June 4) suggests that President Clinton's missile defense proposal, a mini-version of President Ronald Reagan's ''Star Wars'' program, has been a political ploy. We should flood our representatives, many still with some integrity, to urge Congress to conduct an independent inquiry about the feasibility of an effective missile defense system.</p>
        <p>If the gullibility of the taxpayer has been manipulated by unscrupulous politicians of all sides, our voice should be raised: enough is enough.  ISAAC COHEN  Wilmette, Ill., June 4, 2000</p>
