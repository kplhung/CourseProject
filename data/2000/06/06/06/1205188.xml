        <p>The board of Bestfoods met last night to discuss a sweetened takeover offer of about $20 billion, or $72 a share, from Unilever amid increasing pressure from shareholders to sell the company.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Bestfoods was pursuing a $15 billion purchase of the Campbell Soup Company, the beleaguered maker of canned soups that has been struggling to expand its business over the last several years. One person involved in the talks said the company would also discuss its options with Campbell at the board meeting, which may resume today. Representatives of Campbell and of Bestfoods refused to comment on the reports.</p>
        <p>Unilever increased its bid by $6 a share, to $72, Sunday night, executives said. That offer for the maker of Skippy peanut butter, Thomas' English muffins, Entenmann's baked goods and Knorr soups was up from the $61 to $64 originally offered in April. At the time, the board of Bestfoods  unanimously rejected the plan, saying the price was inadequate and that it did not think it was ''opportune to consider a sale of the company.''</p>
        <p>Both Niall FitzGerald and Antony Burgmans, the co-chairmen of Unilever, arrived in New York on Friday and have been waiting anxiously for breakthroughs in their bid to acquire Bestfoods. ''They look very tired,'' said a person close to the talks. ''This is gamesmanship. It's three-dimensional chess, with humans.''</p>
        <p>In an interview last month, Mr. Burgmans said his company was surprised that the $66-a-share offer had not brought Bestfoods executives to the negotiating table. ''What puzzles and amazes us,'' he said, ''is that at that price, a premium of 34 percent over what the stock was trading at, they haven't come up to talk to us.'' The company has seemed unwilling to bid higher, without a real competitor other than Bestfoods' reluctance.</p>
        <p>It is not clear whether the latest increase will be enough to make the board budge from its position, although several large investors said they thought Unilever was headed in the right direction.</p>
        <p>''I do think Bestfoods will end up selling at a price anywhere from $72 to $75,'' said Alexi Makkas, a principal equity analyst for State Street Global Advisors in Boston, which, with 5.7 million shares, is the fourth-largest shareholder of Bestfoods. ''Bestfood's management team are rational people and they understand they are not going to be able to get this sort of value on their own. They have been adamant the entire time about doing the best thing for shareholders.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Unilever in New York said the company would be making no statements yesterday on its attempt to buy Bestfoods.</p>
        <p>Executives close to the talks said that Unilever, whose brands include Dove, Lipton and Good Humor, had raised its bid for Bestfoods from $66, first offered in April, to about $72 a share over the weekend. The actual price had not been fixed, executives  said, because Unilever wanted to first determine whether there were additional cost savings that might be realized through the merger. Unilever said it anticipated $500 million in such savings, but in talks with investors, Bestfoods has asserted that closer to $1 billion could be saved through a merger.</p>
        <p>The offer was made in a letter delivered to Bestfoods on Sunday night, according to a person close to the talks. The letter was accompanied by a draft contract intended to be a starting point for negotiations, the person said, adding that top executives from Unilever and Bestfoods met informally on Saturday.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Bestfoods' bankers have been discussing merger possibilities with their counterparts for Campbell. Investors seemed highly disapproving of any union with Campbell, and drove down Bestfood's share price yesterday in response to reports that the company was considering such a move. Shares of Bestfoods closed at $63 yesterday, down $2.125.</p>
        <p>''Bestfoods has been scrambling for alternatives for the last month, but I don't see how buying Campbell's is a defense against a $70-plus all-cash bid,'' said John R. McMillin, an analyst for Prudential Securities. With a board considered independent, and not dominated by company insiders, many expect Bestfoods to make a decision that will provide the biggest payout to investors.</p>
        <p>Another shareholder, Barry Goggins of David L. Babson &amp; Company, said a Campbell-Bestfoods union would not play well with investors. ''The Street obviously thinks Bestfoods is ready to do something defensive,'' he said. ''But with Campbell's problems, I'm wondering how they can compare this and make it shareholder-friendly, relative to the Unilever offer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Makkus of State Street said that a serious move in the direction of a Campbell acquisition would be devastating for shareholders, and for the company. ''If they go out and buy Campbell, the stock gets crushed and management loses all credibility,'' he said. ''After that, there's no way the stock gets back up to $72.''</p>
        <p>The most recent increased bid from Unilever does not necessarily represent a capitulation, said one person close to the talks. ''It could be interpreted as bidding against yourself, or it could be interpreted as paying more for more synergies,'' the person said. ''Unilever on this occasion is more likely to walk away than to engage in further debate on the subject.''</p>
