        <p>With its rows of cherry trees casting soothing pools of shade at midday and mothers ferrying babies on the backs of bicycles across the tracks, there is hardly anything sinister about the railroad crossing at the edge of this town.</p>
        <p>But with trains speeding by every three to five minutes, and relative discretion guaranteed by its bucolic setting, this simple railroad crossing has emerged as a favorite spot for ending one's life. And the booming number of deaths on this rail line has given it the reputation of being Japan's suicide express.</p>
        <p>''I live on the second floor of that green house, and there seem to be suicides here all the time'' said Yukari Omoto, a 30-year-old mother who was ferrying her toddler daughter to town in a bicycle seat. ''When I hear the noise I look out the window to see. By coincidence, once I saw the whole thing take place.''</p>
        <p>In just a few minutes of interviews, Ms. Omoto's gory description was matched by tales of death on the tracks by many others whose daily commutes take them past this spot, a reflection of just how banal the events have become. ''At the beauty parlor I heard that people walk with their backs to the trains and jump on the track at the last moment,'' said Yoshiko Hatori, a 44-year-old archaeologists' assistant. ''It seems that they're coming in bunches.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, rail suicides have come in such bunches lately that the operator of this line, the East Japan Railway Company, or JR East, has begun to treat them as nothing less than a company-wide disaster.</p>
        <p>During the 1990's, suicide deaths skyrocketed on JR East's network of lines, increasing to 212 last year, from 81 at the start of the decade and far outstripping the 50 percent increase in the number of suicides nationally during that period. And year in and year out, the 80 miles of the company's Chuo Rapid, a heavily traveled express to the bedroom communities west of the capital bears the largest concentration.</p>
        <p>''We are suffering major losses from suicide,'' said Masaki Ogata, general manager for transport safety of JR East. ''We've been studying the problem for 13 years now. There are various measures that we can take to reduce suicides, but in the end, man is the problem.''</p>
        <p>The train company will not say exactly what the suicides have cost it.</p>
        <p>Typically, a suicide causes an hourlong delay in train service, which begins with a sudden stop, and then the dreaded announcement over the loudspeaker that there has been a ''human incident.''</p>
        <p>Train companies charge the families of suicide victims for damages caused by the suicides. JR East is just one of several train and subway companies operating in the Tokyo area, but it is widely rumored that JR East became the most popular line for suicides because it charged the bereaved families the least.</p>
        <p>''This is a delicate matter,'' said a rail official, who declined to give information on damage claims by the company. ''Naturally, we would not like to encourage people.'' Other rail companies, for that matter, would not even release suicide statistics.</p>
        <p>JR East's latest efforts to discourage suicide include painting crossings like these in a green so bright it could have sprung from The Wizard of Oz. The thinking behind this, based on psychologists' studies, is that the dazzling color will alter the state of mind of would-be suicides. The company has also increased the number of remote surveillance cameras along its route and trimmed back tree branches to deny people a sense of privacy.</p>
        <p>At enclosed stations, where 46 percent of the deaths occurred last year, JR East has begun installing mirrors across the tracks from passenger platforms, with the idea that the sight of oneself could give a jumper pause.</p>
        <p>Many experts say, though, that efforts like these are likely to prove futile. Psychologists speak of the suicides as an economic crisis and social crisis all wrapped up in one.</p>
        <p>The decade-long rash of suicides has coincided with an economic stagnation that is unequaled in modern Japanese history. In a society where much is driven by shame, record-high levels of unemployment have turned many men into despondent, daytime wanderers who pretend to have gainful occupations by staying away from home all day.</p>
        <p>Many people here say that as a nation, too, Japan seems to have lost its purpose. For decades, the goal was to catch up with the West economically. Since attaining that goal in the 1980's, the country has been adrift.</p>
        <p>When he set up a telephone hot line last year to help suicidal people, with financial sponsorship from JR East, Dr. Yukio Saito received 1,300 calls a week from people -- mostly men -- who said they were ashamed of their failings and were considering ending their lives.</p>
        <p>''The economic crisis has created quite a lot of anxiety at the turn of the century,'' said Dr. Saito. ''There is a lack of hope. People have no dreams for the future, and everything seems to be declining.'' In such a setting, he said, ''suicide has become sort of epidemic.''</p>
        <p>Here in Kunitachi City, as she crossed the tracks aboard her plain black bicycle, a 68-year-old woman who has long lived in this town and who would give her name only as Sato said much the same thing, only in simpler terms.</p>
        <p>''There seem to be more people doing it all the time,'' she said about the railway suicides. ''There was a time when the only people you would hear about dying here were junior high school students fooling around on the tracks. But that was before the economy went bad.''</p>
