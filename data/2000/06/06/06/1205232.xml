        <p>In his dozen years as head of the Diocese of Bridgeport, Bishop Edward M. Egan has had his leadership tested repeatedly by a long-running, uncommonly public dispute with the parish of Our Lady of Montserrat, a fast-growing congregation of Hispanic immigrants here that in many ways represents the future of Roman Catholic America.</p>
        <p>The controversy has centered on the simple fact that Our Lady of Montserrat, despite vibrant growth, has never had its own suitably sized building. Parishioners yearned to build a new church. Bishop Egan decided that the parish could not afford it. In 1997, relations with the bishop became so bitter, including charges of anti-Hispanic bias, that the church's pastor, the Rev. Bernardo Rodriguez, resigned in protest.</p>
        <p>This month, both Our Lady of Montserrat and Bishop Egan move on. On Friday, under the bishop's order, the parish will leave its cramped building to merge with the parish of St. Benedict, half a mile south in the Cove section. Ten days later, Bishop Egan will be installed as the archbishop of New York.</p>
        <p>As he prepares to take the most visible Catholic pulpit in the nation, both Bishop Egan's most devoted supporters and his harshest critics have pointed to his handling of Our Lady of Montserrat as an indication  of how he will take control of an unwieldy archdiocese with 10 counties, 2.4 million worshipers and complex financial concerns.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, officials close to Bishop Egan have characterized the merger of the two churches as the latest example of his deep commitment to meeting the needs of immigrants, which they saw fit to emphasize as he moved to New York, where there are nearly 900,000 Hispanic Catholics, more than double the number of all parishioners in the Diocese of Bridgeport.</p>
        <p>It could also be seen, they said, as evidence of his management skill in consolidating to cut costs and of a willingness to make tough decisions in the face of public outcry. These qualities, they said, would be essential in New York, where many financially struggling schools and parishes need to be  consolidated or closed.</p>
        <p>''There has been a public dispute with respect to the bishop's leadership regarding Our Lady of Montserrat,'' said Tom Drohan, a spokesman for the Bridgeport Diocese.  ''As the leader of the diocese, he has responsibility for the health of each parish, the spiritual health and the financial health.''</p>
        <p>But some parishioners at Our Lady of Montserrat view the merger as the latest blunder in a long dispute in which Bishop Egan and his predecessor, Bishop Walter Curtis, failed to help the parish build its own permanent house of worship. It is evidence, they say, of an autocratic, unyielding style less concerned with people than with finances.</p>
        <p>Some parishioners say they not only feel betrayed by Bishop Egan,  but are doubly stung by the lavish praise heaped upon him after his appointment to succeed Cardinal John J. O'Connor. Some described Bishop Egan as not just unconcerned with immigrants, but as anti-Hispanic.</p>
        <p>''That's the impression that the people here have of him,'' said the Rev. Leonard Paskus, who has been the administrator of Our Lady of Montserrat for a year and a half.  Father Paskus said he disagreed with the negative view of Bishop Egan, but he invited parishioners to vent their anger at a meeting shortly after the merger with St. Benedict was announced in March. About 60 people attended.</p>
        <p>''I think it's injustice,'' said Maurizio Ahumada at the meeting. ''It's discrimination. He has been described as a brilliant fund-raiser, but he never did anything to help this parish.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ahumada recalled a meeting with Bishop Egan in September 1997. It began, he said, not with a prayer or a call for healing, but with a warning. ''You will not bend me,'' Mr. Ahumada recalled the bishop's saying. ''I have been in this business for too long.''</p>
        <p>Msgr. Aniceto Villamide, the vicar for Hispanic ministry, dismissed the criticism, saying Hispanics had  flourished under Bishop Egan. The bishop learned Spanish when he arrived in Bridgeport, and frequently worshiped in Spanish, they said.</p>
        <p>''Bishop Egan was very supportive of Hispanics,'' Monsignor Villamide said. ''The numbers speak for themselves. When he came here 11 years ago, there were only three Spanish-speaking priests from Hispanic countries. Right now, when he leaves, there are 10.''</p>
        <p>Under Bishop Egan, Monsignor Villamide said, the diocese began a weekly radio program in Spanish and added a page in Spanish to the diocesan newspaper. ''He was the one to take the initiative to create that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But none of this has swayed Our Lady of Montserrat parishioners. It may be telling that when he went to the church to announce the merger, Bishop Egan was accompanied not by Monsignor Villamide but by Michael Dolan, the diocese's lawyer.</p>
        <p>Much of the bitterness stems from the thwarted efforts of parishioners to undertake a renovation and expansion of Our Lady of Montserrat's building on Hope Street. An architect's rendering showed a white Spanish colonial building with a red-tiled roof, arched windows and a bell tower.</p>
        <p>The parish, which has more than 1,500 members, raised $500,000 by  summer 1997 to meet goals set by Bishop Egan. Current and former parishioners said they kept their end of the deal. All they needed, they said, was the bishop's help to get a loan for the balance.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Drohan said, the church never met a diocesan requirement that any parish wishing to undertake a building project must have enough money to cover at least half of the cost. By the time the parish raised $500,000, the projected expansion cost had increased from $1 million to more than $1.5 million, he said.</p>
        <p>So in July 1997, Bishop Egan decided against giving the parish its loan. Angry parishioners held a rally  with signs questioning the bishop's faith. Father Rodriguez, their beloved pastor, quit.</p>
        <p>''Some feel if we were an Anglo community,'' Father Paskus said, ''we would have been given permission to build.''</p>
        <p>Monsignor Villamide said Bishop Egan's decisions reflected a trend among Catholic leaders to prefer territorial parishes that served parishioners within a geographic area to national parishes intended for an ethnic group.</p>
        <p>He added that the bishop was tending to a growing community of Haitian Catholics in Stamford, which  would get the building now occupied by Our Lady of Montserrat as a community center. Several parishioners at Our Lady of Montserrat said they suspected that the diocese  planned to sell the property, a valuable parcel surrounded by condominium buildings. Mr. Drohan denied any intention to sell.</p>
        <p>Gabriela Rivera was among those shocked by the merger. ''After an hour and a half with the bishop, you are wondering what are you here for,'' she said. ''You are here just to listen and obey.''</p>
        <p>For more than 15 years, the parishioners of Our Lady of Montserrat have been a tribe of Catholic nomads, going from one building to another. By 1984, their original home, a small wood-frame building in downtown Stamford, could no longer hold them. Bishop Curtis proposed a merger with St. Benedict.</p>
        <p>That merger was abandoned after  protests from hundreds of parishioners at St. Benedict and pleas from  Our Lady of Montserrat worshipers who hoped to build their own church.</p>
        <p>In 1988, Our Lady of Montserrat bought a building on Hope Street, knowing it would not be big enough for its growing needs. That December, Edward Michael Egan, who had been vicar of education in New York, was installed as head of the Bridgeport Diocese.</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan arrived to find a diocese deeply in debt. Many of its urban churches and schools, once filled with European immigrants, were impoverished. Alongside the old congregations were equally poor new ones filled with immigrants from Central and South America.</p>
        <p>The new bishop closed some schools and initiated a fund-raising campaign. It was not a time to talk about building anything. In 1995, with Our Lady of Montserrat asking for more space, Bishop Egan sought to add a Spanish Mass at St. Mary's, one of Stamford's largest churches.</p>
        <p>Parishioners at St. Mary's, mostly of Irish or Italian descent, suspected a possible merger and rebelled.  ''Why does Montserrat need to have its own church?'' one St. Mary's worshiper wrote to The Advocate of Stamford. ''Why should it take ours? If most of the parishioners there consist of illegal aliens and the like, why should they have the right to such a voice in selecting the church they'd like to own?''</p>
        <p>Any idea of joining the churches was dropped, and Bishop Egan swiftly removed the pastor of St. Mary's.  Lay leaders said they thought their priest had been punished for their opposition to a merger with Our Lady of Montserrat.</p>
        <p>Our Lady of Montserrat continued to hope for its own church. After the fight with St. Mary's, planning began in earnest for expanding Our Lady of Montserrat. Financial and architectural plans were drawn up.</p>
        <p>''The parishioners of Our Lady did everything they were supposed to do in good faith, but in the end we were told we couldn't do it for reasons that were not justified,'' said Alex Martinez, a former parishioner who was the parish's lawyer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martinez left the parish after the resignation of Father Rodriguez. Father Rodriguez, now a minister at Bridgeport Hospital, declined to discuss his battle with the bishop. ''I got in a lot of trouble before for my mouth,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Since his resignation, Our Lady of Montserrat has not had an official pastor, but an administrator. Seeking to underscore that the merger with St. Benedict would be an equal one, Bishop Egan announced that Father Paskus and the Rev. Vincent Veich of St. Benedict would be co-pastors of the new St. Benedict-Our Lady of Montserrat.</p>
        <p>The diocesan newspaper applauded the merger as providing new lifeblood for the older congregation and a new home for the younger one, a Tudor-style stone church with stained glass and a separate social hall. Its mission would be to serve new Americans, whether from Eastern Europe or Uruguay.</p>
        <p>Father Veich attended the meeting at Our Lady of Montserrat to listen to the complaints, and he offered calming words. Parishioners at St. Benedict are apprehensive about parking, but have responded favorably to the tripling of their congregation.</p>
        <p>Father Veich said the merger guaranteed that St. Benedict, built to serve Slovak Catholics, would remain strong. He said it was fitting that a parish that served one immigrant group at the start of the 20th century would serve another at the start of the 21st. ''It seems as if it's keeping faithful to its own mission,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The church secretary, Cathy Romano, has prepared the first joint newsletter, in English and Spanish.  Some parishioners are contemplating new culinary traditions. ''I don't know about kielbasa anymore at the picnics,'' said Ronnie Florio. Her husband, Tony, disagreed. ''We'll mix it with the enchiladas,'' he said. ''We'll have a variety of food.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Drohan said the bishop and others were confident things would work out. ''Part of what goes with the bishop's role is the loneliness of command,'' he said. ''But a decision isn't made in a vacuum. It's measured against facts. It's measured against the future and future needs.</p>
        <p>''Was it an unpopular decision?'' he said of the merger. ''Clearly it was in certain quarters. Was it the correct decision? We're very confident that the parishioners and the community will see that it was.''</p>
