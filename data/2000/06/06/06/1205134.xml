        <p>GROUCHO  The Life and Times of Julius Henry Marx  By Stefan Kanfer  Illustrated. 465 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $30.</p>
        <p>Groucho Marx once said that the best line he ever heard about show business was spoken by an audience member in a small Midwestern town. Before he bought a ticket, the man said he wanted to know one thing: Was the show ''sad or high-kickin'?''</p>
        <p>As recounted in Stefan Kanfer's new biography, Groucho's own life was, in almost equal measure, sad and high-kickin', his precarious, attenuated childhood leaving him with a lifelong emotional legacy of insecurity and resentment, while fueling the derogatory wisecracks and anarchic antics that would make him famous. Not only would Groucho and his brothers patent a high-kickin' brand of cacophonous comedy -- part vaudeville, part theater of the absurd, part surrealistic satire -- but Groucho himself, with his raffish claw-hammer coat, his waggling, lascivious eyebrows and omnipresent cigar, would become an iconic figure, the very avatar of iconoclasm and irreverence and plain old-fashioned mayhem.</p>
        <p>In ''Groucho: The Life and Times of Julius Henry Marx,'' Mr. Kanfer does a nimble job of tracing the outlines of Groucho's life and the evolution of his antic art. The book would have been considerably stronger had the author devoted more space to such comic masterpieces as ''Duck Soup'' and less space to the later, formulaic comedies; more space to the formative days in vaudeville and less space to the comic's declining years. Still, Mr. Kanfer conveys both a keenly felt appreciation of the brothers' inimitable talent and an understanding of its sources in vaudeville, commedia dell'arte and the boys' own refusal (or inability) to grow up.</p>
        <p>It is Mr. Kanfer's opinion that Groucho never really recovered from being ''pushed out of the nest before he was ready'' and that as a result he would internalize his lost childhood, remaining forever ''immature in matters of women, money and power.''</p>
        <p>Although the young Julius harbored dreams of becoming a doctor, he was pulled out of school by his domineering mother, Minnie, who made no secret of her impatience with her bookish middle son. By age 15 he was part of a touring vaudeville act and left whatever remaining innocence he had on the road. He had his meager savings stolen twice by unscrupulous colleagues and lost his virginity to a prostitute who left him with a case of gonorrhea, incidents that would leave the teenager with a deep suspicion of people and an even deeper pessimism.</p>
        <p>As Groucho's trademark persona evolved, Mr. Kanfer writes, the comic had increasing ''difficulty separating the performer and the man beneath the makeup.'' Though he left womanizing to his older brother Chico -- Groucho was too insecure, too guarded to act the part of the leering ladies man he affected onstage -- he relentlessly bullied his wives, taking advantage of their vulnerabilities the same way his mother had once taken advantage of his. The ''hard clown mask he had created'' rarely slipped, even when he was dealing with his beloved but misunderstood children. He was ''incapable of expressing emotion, no matter how deep,'' Mr. Kanfer writes, ''unless he came at it from an angle.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Kanfer tells it, one of the formative experiences in Groucho's life came with the onset of the Depression. While the stock market crash of 1929, which wiped out the comic's carefully hoarded savings, confirmed his apprehensive outlook on the world, it also galvanized a skeptical, anti-establishment attitude on the part of the American public. Henceforth ''such sweet, soft-edged comedians as Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton would have a harder time in this era; aggressive, impertinent personalities like W. C. Fields, Mae West, and the Marx Brothers -- Groucho in particular -- would flourish by assaulting the powerful.''</p>
        <p>Early Paramount movies like ''Animal Crackers'' (1930), ''Monkey Business'' (1931) and ''Horse Feathers'' (1932) served notice that the brothers' sublime blend of nonsense and chaos theory worked as well on screen as it had on the stage. Their 1933 classic, the glorious ''Duck Soup,'' fared poorly at the box office, however, and when the brothers moved to MGM, the studio's chief, Irving Thalberg, set down a new set of rules. The horseplay in the earlier pictures had been too unfettered, the ad libs too ad hoc, Thalberg declared; to broaden the brothers' appeal, more story line and more sentiment would be injected. While the result was undeniably a hit, ''A Night at the Opera'' -- and the increasingly mediocre movies that followed in its wake -- presented a newly domesticated version of the brothers.</p>
        <p>''Instead of making sport of romance, they now facilitated it,'' Mr. Kanfer writes. ''Instead of whacking away at the powerful institutions of government or the military or education, they battled the toothless enemy of grand opera. At Thalberg's insistence the crew of maniacs had become hilarious but harmless uncles, like the later Laurel and Hardy. They were not outrageous anymore, they were only frivolous.''</p>
        <p>Because Mr. Kanfer spends so much time anatomizing the decline of the Marx Brothers' films and even more time recounting Groucho's marital woes, the second half of this book -- with a brief timeout to chronicle the comic's second career as the cult quiz master of ''You Bet Your Life'' -- often devolves into a sad litany of disappointments and frustrations. What enlivens these depressing and unnecessarily long chapters are the copious quotations from Groucho's own work.</p>
        <p>These remarks (which can be found at greater length in ''The Essential Groucho,'' edited by Mr. Kanfer and available from Vintage Books) may show Groucho -- a k a Rufus T. Firefly, a k a Waldorf P. Flywheel, a k a Captain Spaulding -- with his clown's mask firmly in place, cigar in hand and eyebrows cocked. But like the early Paramount films, they remind us, in Ben Hecht's words, of the ''perpetual Halloween called the Marx Brothers'' and the genius of the would-be doctor born 11 decades ago Julius Henry Marx.</p>
