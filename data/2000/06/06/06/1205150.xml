        <p>Despite the return of Rosie O'Donnell as host, the competition may have been just too much for the Tony Awards on Sunday night. The show was up against ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the season premiere of ''Sex and the City,'' and the Lakers-Trail Blazers game.</p>
        <p>The fast national rating for the two-hour CBS broadcast -- meaning an early tally -- was the lowest ever: 6.1, down from 7.0 last year. The ratings have been steadily declining, from 8.4 in 1998 and 9.6 in 1997. Each rating point represents just over a million homes.</p>

        <p>Despite the return of Rosie O'Donnell as host, the competition may have been just too much for the Tony Awards on Sunday night. The show was up against ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the season premiere of ''Sex and the City,'' and the Lakers-Trail Blazers game.</p>
        <p>The fast national rating for the two-hour CBS broadcast -- meaning an early tally -- was the lowest ever: 6.1, down from 7.0 last year. The ratings have been steadily declining, from 8.4 in 1998 and 9.6 in 1997. Each rating point represents just over a million homes.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, within the theater industry the consensus was that this year's ceremony was a great improvement over last year's. In addition to what many considered a misguided effort to honor straight plays with a montage of lines, last year's show at the last minute dropped the number from one of the nominated musicals, ''It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'' because of time constraints.</p>
        <p>This year the show ended early, all the musical numbers were performed, and most people in the industry agreed that the broadcast made Broadway look exciting.</p>
        <p>There were those who came away disappointed, like the creators of ''The Wild Party,'' which won no awards and, with flagging ticket sales, was in need of a boost. George C. Wolfe, the director, co-writer and co-producer of the show, said that there were no plans yet to close it.</p>
        <p>Other shows shut out of the awards included Susan Stroman's revival of ''Music Man,'' Matthew Warchus's acclaimed production of Sam Shepard's ''True West,'' and ''Dirty Blonde,'' Claudia Shear's homage to Mae West.</p>
