        <p>After unusually amicable negotiations, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, announced a $37.6 billion budget accord yesterday that relies in part on this year's record surplus to cut business and income taxes  and still expands government services.</p>
        <p>The City Council had the most to boast about, given that the mayor, consistent with his ''kinder, gentler'' approach to governing in recent weeks, agreed to nearly all of the major bargaining points being pushed by Mr. Vallone and his colleagues.</p>
        <p>The budget package for the 2001 fiscal year includes money to extend library hours, provide weekend meals for lower-income elderly citizens and to install about 75 of the city's long-planned street-side toilets. The mayor even surprised Council negotiators by accepting a Council plan to restructure the personal income tax rates so that a smaller share is paid by middle- and lower-income residents.</p>
        <p>''It is an excellent budget,'' Mr. Giuliani said, standing amid two dozen Council members, whom he greeted with repeated handshakes, slaps on the back and even hugs. ''It is one that achieves the objectives that the administration wants to achieve and the objectives the Council wants to achieve. It was done through compromise and agreement.''</p>
        <p>But the Council and mayor both warned that the deal could unravel since state legislators were likely to approve a change in the coming weeks in pension benefits for retired city employees that could cost the city as much as $1 billion in the 2001 fiscal year. If that happens, they said, the $414 million tax cut package, which involves nine items including a $329 million reduction in the personal income tax and a $23 million child-care tax credit, is the part of the budget the city is most likely to scale back.</p>
        <p>''Forget the politics and just do the right thing,'' Mr. Vallone said, directing his comments to city legislators in Albany, asking that any new pension burden not be too great. ''Don't let the air change that happens when you get to Exit 23'' at Albany, he said, joking about the difference a little distance can make. He urged that they not ''forget who you represent,'' adding, ''This is still our town.''</p>
        <p>A $3.2 billion surplus is expected this fiscal year, beating last year's record largely as a result of the still booming city economy. About a third of the surplus would be set aside to help curtail budget deficits already projected to start surfacing in 2002.  But Charles Brecher, research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, said the plan called for far too much of the surplus to be used to support basic city expenses in the coming year, a practice that could be dangerous if the economy goes sour.</p>
        <p>''It is like getting a bonus in your paycheck and using it to rent a bigger apartment,'' Mr. Brecher said. ''You can afford it at first, but then the money runs out.''</p>
        <p>The budget also relies in part on a one-time windfall of about $808 million that the city is getting over two years by taking credit for larger than expected profits gained through the investment of city pension funds. In order to get the unions to allow the city to tap those funds, the mayor agreed to sweeten their pension benefits, costing the city nearly $300 million a year, an expense that Mr. Brecher said would never go away.</p>
        <p>Giuliani administration officials said the budget would be a prudent one, but added that they would start soon after the fiscal year begins on July 1 to look for ways to limit spending to reduce the possible deficits in later years. Those are projected to be about $2.7 billion by 2002.</p>
        <p>The negotiations between the mayor and the Council focused in the last two weeks on competing tax cut plans and proposals for spending for city agencies. The biggest expense, as is always the case, is the school system, which would get $11.1 billion, the mayor said, a gain of 3.7 percent. The figures for other city agencies were not released yesterday, since budget officials were still adjusting the totals to take into account changes the mayor and Council had backed.</p>
        <p>The spending adjustments ultimately agreed to as part of the settlement announced yesterday are tiny compared to the entire budget. They add up to $170 million, about $100 million of which restores cuts proposed by the mayor in April and about $70 million that actually increases city spending.</p>
        <p>The mayor's more conciliatory approach to the budget this year surfaced in April, when he dropped his traditional push to cut spending for city libraries and cultural institutions. Now he has gone even further, agreeing to a Council request to increase spending in these areas by a total of $25 million. Even the Brooklyn Museum of Art, site of the ''Sensation'' exhibit the mayor had condemned, would get about 8 percent more city support, Council officials said.</p>
        <p>''It was very hostile,'' the mayor joked yesterday at a news conference in describing this year's negotiations, arousing laughter from the Council members assembled, before one Council member joked about a ''kinder, gentler'' mayor.</p>
        <p>Other new spending added at the Council's request includes $6 million for weekend meals for the elderly and an extra $5.2 million to provide health insurance for more of the city residents who now lack coverage. The mayor yesterday pointed proudly to some of his own initiatives included in the budget: $160 million to build new DNA laboratories to expand the genetic testing of suspects and other money to hire new school safety officers.</p>
        <p>The Council and the mayor also agreed to use mostly federal funding to hire about 1,230 new police officers. And $12 million is being set aside for special school system initiatives, like charter schools, although the mayor dropped his insistence that some of it be used to finance a voucher program that would help parents send their children to private or parochial schools. There is also $1.7 million to offer women free breast cancer screening and to support educational programs related to ovarian and prostate cancer, an initiative that the mayor, who himself has prostate cancer, had originally proposed to cut.</p>
        <p>The biggest piece of the tax cut package is a reduction in the personal income tax. Instead of just cutting the tax rate consistently across all income levels, the mayor agreed to a Council proposal to restructure the tax system. As a result, taxpayers earning less than $70,000 a year would pay about 12 percent less in city personal income tax, with a smaller reduction for the more affluent, dropping to less than 1 percent for those who earn $1 million or more. A taxpayer earning $60,000 to $70,000 a year would pay about $207 less.</p>
        <p>The tax cut package includes a child-care tax credit, which varies depending on a family's income but would be worth $385 a year for a family with two children and an income of about $28,000. There is also a proposal to give a tax break to elderly residents who rent apartments on a moderate income.</p>
        <p>The City Council could vote as soon as today to adopt the proposed budget. But the city needs the approval of the State Legislature before it can enact most of the tax cuts. And if the Legislature approves cost-of-living increases for more than 100,000 retired city workers -- increases tied to inflation year after year -- then pieces of the tax cut plan might be abandoned, Mr. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>Officials in Albany said the negotiations on the proposed pension program were still under way, and the city estimates that the program could cost the city $500 million to $1 billion. But Herman D. Farrell Jr., a New York City Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, said the mayor and Council had their priorities wrong.</p>
        <p>''The constant harping on tax cuts versus a cost-of-living increase for retirees is obscene,'' Mr. Farrell said, adding that retired workers need a pension that can allow them to afford basic expenses.</p>
        <p>Estimates of overall city spending differed. The mayor said yesterday that city-supported spending would decline by 2.9 percent or $600 million compared with the current fiscal year. But the city's Independent Budget Office said that number did not take into account the city's habit of using the surplus to prepay some of the next year's expenses. Once these measures are considered, actual spending would be up by more than 6 percent, or more than twice the rate of inflation, said Ronnie Lowenstein, deputy director and chief economist at the Independent Budget Office.</p>
