        <p>Inside their locker room on Sunday, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant sat quietly with their Laker teammates and listened to Phil Jackson's final instructions for Game 7.</p>
        <p>Maybe 20 yards away in a corridor of the Staples Center, Magic Johnson held court before the deciding game of the Western Conference finals.</p>
        <p>After a decade of playoff frustration, Johnson was wondering the same as everyone who has watched O'Neal and Bryant grow and mature the past four seasons: Were they ready to fuse the Lakers' magical past with its promising future?</p>
        <p>''I know what it means to Shaq,'' said Johnson, who led the Lakers to their last finals in 1991. ''He wants to get that loser's tag off his back. I know how much this means to him. It means a lot to those guys.''</p>
        <p>The largest fourth-quarter comeback in National Basketball Association history was still a few hours away, the night the Lakers came from 15 points down in the final 10 minutes 28 seconds and shocked Portland, 89-84, before the most raucous and unlaid-back L.A. crowd anyone could remember.</p>
        <p>O'Neal had not yet scored 9 of his 18 points in the final period, shelving his frustration at being mobbed by Blazers underneath the basket so that he could find open teammates on the perimeter with the game in the balance. It was long before he would calmly collect on 8 of 12 free throws, including two with 2:44 left that tied the game at 77-77.</p>
        <p>Bryant had yet to put up an eye-opening line of 25 points, 11 rebounds, 7 assists and 4 blocked shots. He had not yet broken a tie with a scintillating jump shot left of the free-throw line with 1:34 left or thrown that impossible lob pass to the right of the rim with 41.3 seconds remaining that O'Neal threw down, the most pressurized alley-oop dunk of any playoff series, ever.</p>
        <p>Before their heroics, O'Neal and Bryant were merely two young All-Stars trying to find their way.</p>
        <p>''For so long, Kobe and Shaq and all of us were in a mode of not being able to prove ourselves when it mattered,'' Rick Fox said. ''After a while, that wears on you. I'm still processing all of it. You come so far and you lose your way, and then you have to work so hard to get back to where you were. We found our way. And we kept going.''</p>
        <p>It took nearly a decade.</p>
        <p>Since the last vestige of Showtime left the Fabulous Forum and the Magic stopped in 1991 many have tried to pass this franchise off as a passable imitation. The Lakers of Shaq and Kobe were a team of marketable faces, flair, the only consistent ratings grabber after Michael Jordan retired.</p>
        <p>But they had this awful habit of wilting as the postseason wore on. Whether Utah swept the Lakers in the 1998 conference finals or San Antonio accomplished the feat in the second round of the 1999 playoffs, they always managed to die hard.</p>
        <p>It wasn't so much that they lost but the way they lost that gave the appearance of little character and resolve. How could a team with the most awesome physical presence in the game and one of the most exciting young players come apart at the hinges so easily? Why weren't they more durable and resilient?</p>
        <p>''It's not like we doubted ourselves after every season,'' O'Neal said. ''But after a while, you read the newspapers and listen to what people are saying about you. You can't help but let that either get you down or motivate you to change people's perceptions. That's what we did, changed people's perceptions.''</p>
        <p>It appeared to happen in a blink, but the legwork was already there.</p>
        <p>Though they fell behind early, Bryant was collaring rebounds in the first half as if he were a power forward, swinging his elbows to clear space among the Redwood Blazers. For all his talent and highlight reels, he went after Bonzi Wells, Scottie Pippen and Steve Smith on the defensive end as if only playing that end of the floor mattered.</p>
        <p>O'Neal took a while to find a rhythm and didn't lose his temper against Arvydas Sabonis and the rest of Portland's front line, who grabbed, fronted and bumped him no end. He, too, worked hard on both ends, at one point diving into the third row of seats to hunt down a loose ball.</p>
        <p>As the comeback began and their shots started to fall, there would be no more meltdowns. It was just two veterans determined to let a season of accomplishment slip away on their home floor. They would go onto to face the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of the finals tomorrow night at the Staples Center.</p>
        <p>In one quarter, the old issues died and the Lakers suddenly became prohibitive favorites to win the title.</p>
        <p>''The reality is, when you get here, you've got to win it,'' Jackson said. ''We may have learned enough at this point to know how to do it.''</p>
        <p>Johnson, pumping his fist and smiling, was almost as ecstatic as O'Neal and Bryant after the improbable Game 7 victory that most of Los Angeles is still buzzing about today, the night the Lakers' magical past fused seamlessly together with its promising future.</p>
