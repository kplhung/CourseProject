        <p>SIMON-William E., on June 3, 2000, in Santa Barbara, CA, in his 73rd year. Beloved husband of Tonia Adams Simon. Devoted father of William E. Simon, Jr., J. Peter Simon, Mary Beth Simon Streep, Carol Leigh Simon Porges, Aimee Simon Bloom, Julie Ann Simon Munro and Johanna Katrina Simon Morris. Loving brother of Mary Ellen Simon White and Madeline Simon Becker. His wife of 45 years, Carol G. Simon, predeceased him. Also survived by three step-children, Mark T. Mayo, Sean S. Mayo and Alexandra A. Lamm, and by twenty-four grandchildren and five step-granchildren. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave, at 81 St., Tuesday, June 6, 7-9 PM, and Wednesday, June 7, 2-5 and 7-9 PM. Mass of Christian Burial, Thursday, June 8, 10 AM, St. Patrick's Cathedral, 5th Ave and 51 St. Interment private.</p>
        <p>SIMON-William E. The residents, staff, and Trustees of Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center mourn the loss of our great friend, supporter and benefactor, the Honorable William E. Simon, and we extend our deepest sympathies to his family and staff. A devoted Knight of Malta, Mr. Simon volunteered at the Center for many years as a Eucharistic Minister on the AIDS Units, and dispensed unconditional support to those for whom medicine had no answer. The residents knew him as a friend and protector. Mr. Simon was a major force in the establishment of an endowment fund that supports all volunteer programs at the Center, and an annual recognition award was recently dedicated to his legacy. The spirit of his legendary commitment will always be with us.</p>
