        <p>It is true that most people feel powerless to assert their rights to control decisions on end-of-life care (''Charting a Course of Comfort and Treatment''). But the problem isn't with advance directives as much as it is with a health care system unaccustomed to listening, and more interested in curing than caring.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is true that most people feel powerless to assert their rights to control decisions on end-of-life care (''Charting a Course of Comfort and Treatment''). But the problem isn't with advance directives as much as it is with a health care system unaccustomed to listening, and more interested in curing than caring.</p>
        <p>What is needed is the same kind of revolution that changed health care at the beginning of life, where mothers demanded a system that responded to their wishes and ceased treating childbirth as a medical event. The same kind of public militancy is needed so that palliative care is uniformly available, personal wishes are respected and followed and human dignity is protected.</p>
