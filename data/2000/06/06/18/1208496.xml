        <p>Woodman, spare that house!</p>
        <p>Those may not have been the exact words used by Jennifer J. Raab, chairwoman of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, in her entreaty to the developer Harry Macklowe.</p>
        <p>But that was the gist of it, since Mr. Macklowe -- who has been known to demolish a building or two -- was apparently ready to knock down a three-story wood-frame house at 314 East 53rd Street built just after the Civil War.</p>
        <p>Obviously, a little wooden building is a rare thing in mid-Manhattan. But what makes the case of No. 314 so intriguing is that the house is not unique. In fact, it has a twin next door, at No. 312. One is a landmark. The other is not.</p>
        <p>Both were built in 1866, just ahead of a municipal ban on wood construction. Both have mansard roofs and rounded dormers that modestly evoke the French Second Empire style. The literary critic Edmund Wilson once rented No. 314, and Lincoln Kirstein, a founder of the New York City Ballet, occupied No. 312.</p>
        <p>In 1968, No. 312 was designated a landmark at the request of its owner, John Schaffner, a literary agent. But the owner of No. 314 said he was not interested in the designation. So the commission took no action.</p>
        <p>And that was why the landmarks chairwoman could do no more last February than appeal to Mr. Macklowe's conscience, since he had a contract to buy the building and the permits he needed to raze it.</p>
        <p>''I had nothing but moral suasion,'' Ms. Raab said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Macklowe is planning an apartment building on a Second Avenue site that adjoins the wooden houses. Frank Gehry may be the architect. (''I've known him for many years and like his work very much,'' is all the developer would say.)</p>
        <p>The Second Avenue project would have qualified for a zoning bonus under the city's inclusionary housing program if Mr. Macklowe had replaced No. 314 with low-income apartments.</p>
        <p>Instead, after meeting with Ms. Raab, Mr. Macklowe gave up the contract for No. 314 and abandoned that plan. ''We happily cooperated,'' he said, ''because it seemed like an appropriate thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Macklowe played down his financial sacrifice, Ms. Raab gave him credit. ''He lost money and something of value to save this building,'' she said. ''For whatever reason he did it, he made the right decision.''</p>
        <p>With that peril removed, and the house once again under contract, Ms. Raab expects the commission to designate No. 314 a landmark on Tuesday, 32 years after its twin was so designated.</p>
        <p>''We're lucky that we had the opportunity to put this pair back together,'' she said, ''never to be separated again.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps no one is happier than Zarela Martinez, the proprietor of Zarela restaurant at 953 Second Avenue, between 50th and 51st Streets. She owns No. 312 and had urged the commission to hurry.</p>
        <p>As for life behind clapboards, Ms. Martinez said her house was charming, full of character and very small. Its real glory, she said, is the large backyard. She is worried about construction next door but seems less concerned about that other threat to wooden houses: termites. ''I haven't checked,'' she confessed.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 21, 2000, Wednesday  An article on Sunday about a successful effort to keep a wooden house at 314 East 53rd Street from being demolished incorrectly described remarks made by Zarela Martinez, the owner of a twin house at No. 312, when she was asked if it had termites. Ms. Martinez says that when she said, ''I haven't checked,'' she meant in the last few months; she did not mean that she had never had the building inspected.</p>
