        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>With regard to ''Heroes Among Us'' (May 28), I would like to identify the soldier in light-colored fatigues in the front row of your cover photo (shown at left) as my mother, the poet Fruma Gulkowich Berger.</p>
        <p>When Nazi troops attached the Novogrodok ghetto on Aug. 7, 1942, my mother survived by hiding in a cesspool alongside my aunt, Judy Gulkow, two other women and a child. The Nazis discovered their hiding place and riddled the cesspool with bullets. My mother and aunt survived by feigning to be dead. After six days in the cesspool, without food or water, they were rescued by my uncle, Ben Zion Gulkow, who had become a fighter in the Bielski brigade.</p>
