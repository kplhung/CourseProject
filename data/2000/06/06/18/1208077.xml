        <p>Enola Gay</p>
        <p>By Mark Levine.</p>
        <p>University of California,</p>
        <p>cloth, $30; paper, $13.95.</p>
        <p>Shards of story surface and resurface throughout ''Enola Gay,'' Mark Levine's second collection of poems. Actual events are suggested -- these poems mention nightmare horses, the sea, forests, trains that carry human cargo, the author's mother, the plane that bombed Hiroshima -- but most of Levine's poems resist straightforward narrative. The first poem, however, sets a scene: ''He missed his mother. He would look for her still / in the green oblivious woods. And he would sing / the song that her long absence implied, though his voice / was not good and even he distrusted his voice.'' This mistrust of voice, of telling, fuels this poetry. Levine camouflages tales within the rich and obscure processes of invention. Hallucinations (''I see a people peeled like fresh envelopes''), lists and puns allude to private and public histories, to loss and suffering. In ''Lullaby,'' a pilot paints his mother's two names on his plane; the reader guesses that those names must be Enola Gay. The poems stammer with futility: what can they tell this devastated world? In ''John Keats,'' a horrific postnuclear vision, the exquisite ambiguity of Keats's Grecian urn, its stopped narrative, is reduced to ''treatment methods / we were eager to share.'' Story has shattered; the poet can only say: ''We are sorry to hear of the earth's loss. / We send our regrets, burdens and regrets.''</p>
