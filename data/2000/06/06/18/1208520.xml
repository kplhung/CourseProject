        <p>Ronnie Spector Greenfield and the other Ronettes have a reason to whu-oh-oh again.</p>
        <p>In a golden oldie of a lawsuit, a Manhattan judge ruled on Friday that the Ronettes, the first of the great bad-girl groups, whose ''Be My Baby'' became an anthem of the 60's, were entitled to $2.6 million in royalties and interest for recordings made for their producer, Phil Spector.</p>
        <p>The Ronettes -- Mrs. Greenfield, who was married to Mr. Spector for six years; her sister Estelle Bennett Dong; and their cousin Nedra Talley Ross -- sued Mr. Spector 13 years ago, contending that they were cheated by a producer who exploited their talent, took advantage of their naivete and left them with little to show for their stardom but memories.</p>
        <p>Justice Paula Omansky of State Supreme Court in Manhattan found that Mr. Spector, who kept the rights to all Ronettes recordings, had made millions of dollars in ways not authorized by his 1963 contract with the Ronettes. (''Be My Baby,'' just one of the 28 songs they recorded, sold more than two million copies in 1963.) The Ronettes received one payment of $14,482.30 -- as a group -- for their work, Judge Omansky said.</p>
        <p>She said the contract covered only royalties on sales of phonograph records, but Mr. Spector had sold the recordings for use as background music in movies and advertising, and had licensed without authority the group's master recordings to third parties -- for ''oldies'' compilations and the like. Mr. Spector's lawyer, Andrew Bart, could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Greenfield said she was glad that the suit was finally over. ''I worked very hard making those records in the 60's,'' she said in a statement. ''I didn't know I'd have to wait 37 years to get paid.''</p>
