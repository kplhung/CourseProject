        <p>HOW I ACCIDENTALLY JOINED</p>
        <p>THE VAST RIGHT-WING CONSPIRACY (And Found Inner Peace)</p>
        <p>By Harry Stein.</p>
        <p>Delacorte, $23.95.</p>
        <p>With a smart aleck's nerve and a prophet's boldness, Harry Stein has written a wickedly funny and moral book, puncturing the liberal complacency of New York City like Molly Ivins goading conservative Texas. To join the so-called ''vast right-wing conspiracy,'' he suggests, is really to shoulder the full duties of parenthood. You know you've accidentally signed on, he asserts, when ''you're actually relieved that your daughter plays with dolls and your son plays with guns'' and when ''you are shocked to discover that the only dead white male on your 10th grader's reading list is Oscar Wilde.'' This collection of essays loosely traces Stein's rightward trajectory over 20 hands-on years as a husband and father. He checks off milestones: the first time his wife brought home a copy of Commentary, the first time somebody called him a fascist (for siding with Dan Quayle rather than Murphy Brown) and the grade-school visit during which he first heard about Ritalin (with ''most of the boys making like Bart Simpson, and most of the girls on hand making like Lisa''). He discusses the don't ask-don't tell routine of day care centers, where overworked staff and yuppie parents ignore the children's unhappy days. Stein facetiously blames his predicament on his wife and children -- it was their fault, he claims, that he was originally ''dragooned into what would soon come to be known as 'The Mommy Wars' '' -- but he scores his points in deadly earnest. It is in navigating the costs and complexities of family life, he suggests, that one learns the necessity of a moral compass.</p>
