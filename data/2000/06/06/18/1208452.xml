        <p>After its downward acceleration in the early spring, the stock market remains stuck in neutral. And investors are not sure where it is headed, which is why volume has been so thin lately.</p>
        <p>''I think people in general are cautious,'' said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &amp; Company. ''Until the market gets a string of economic data that's pretty consistent, it's not going anywhere.''</p>
        <p>Stocks were pulled in different directions last week. They rose on a report that retail sales fell in May, a sign that the interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve had succeeded in slowing the economy. But they fell on fears that the economic slowdown would hurt corporate profits.</p>
        <p>Several companies indicated that second-quarter earnings and revenue would not meet Wall Street's high expectations. Among the decliners were Home Depot, Hewlett-Packard and Xerox.</p>
        <p>Rising rates can hurt corporate profits by making it more expensive for companies to finance growth and for customers to buy their products.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 10,449.30, down 164.76, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 14.28, to 3860.56.</p>
