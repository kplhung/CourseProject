      <block class="full_text">
        <p>IN the blown-up photograph, Hakeem Olajuwon is shooting with his right hand while shoving the defender with his left hand.</p>
        <p>''That is definitely an offensive foul,'' said Richard C. Holbrooke, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, pointing at the photo during a reception last Thursday night.</p>
        <p>Olajuwon chortled.</p>
        <p>''You are absolutely right,'' he told Holbrooke, not needing to add that referees, even three of them, cannot possibly call everything.</p>
        <p>The diplomat and the center were speaking the lingua franca known as hoops, shared by a New York man who once dreamed of becoming the next Vince Boryla or Carl Braun with the Knicks, and a man who grew up dreaming of becoming a soccer goalkeeper for Nigeria, until:</p>
        <p>''There were people from my country who went to school in the U.S.,'' Olajuwon said. ''They were not sports fans, but they understood that American basketball was great. They came back and told me about Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Dr. J and Magic. Those three.''</p>
        <p>Olajuwon was recruited to the University of Houston as a 17-year-old who barely knew the fundamentals of basketball. He was a work in progress, albeit a 7-foot work, and as a redshirted freshman, he caught his first glimpse of the N.B.A.</p>
        <p>''I saw Moses Malone,'' he recalled with awe. ''I saw these guys shoot foul shots. I was amazed if they missed. I thought they could shoot blindfolded.''</p>
        <p>Turning professional, Olajuwon helped form the first true wave of foreign-born pro players.</p>
        <p>''This league should be called the International Basketball Association,'' Holbrooke suggested, as David Stern, master of marketing, repressed a wince at the logo ramifications.</p>
        <p>National or international, these current finals have been enriched by Kobe Bryant, who speaks Italian from his childhood watching his American father play professionally in Milan, and by Rik Smits, a center from the Netherlands who came to college in America.</p>
        <p>To recognize this influx, Holbrooke designated five N.B.A. players -- Olajuwon, now an American citizen; Dikembe Mutombo of Congo; Zydrunas Ilgauskas of Lithuania; Vitaly Potapenko of Ukraine and Dirk Nowitzki of Germany -- as international ambassadors of sports.</p>
        <p>''Sport is culture,'' Holbrooke said at the United States residence in the Waldorf Towers, where Henry Cabot Lodge and Adlai Stevenson and other representatives have lived.</p>
        <p>''I remember in the 50's when the U.S. sent 'Porgy and Bess' overseas,'' Holbrooke added. ''Today the N.B.A. represents the U.S.''</p>
        <p>The league is surely an American cultural phenomenon, but it is also becoming more diversified. While no American team yet matches Manchester United or A.C. Milan of soccer in fielding a majority of foreigners, the N.B.A. is catching up.</p>
        <p>The league had approximately 50 foreign-born players this season, and Stu Jackson, who recently returned to the home office after running the Vancouver club, suggests that as many as six first-round draft choices this summer could be foreign born.</p>
        <p>And, the league is not for local consumption only. The N.B.A. has been beaming its finals, mostly live action, to 205 nations including China, where fans still worship the Chicago Red Oxen from the Michael Dynasty.</p>
        <p>''One-third of the visits to our web site -- we don't use the word 'hits' anymore -- are from outside the U.S.,'' noted Adam Silver, the league's Internet maven.</p>
        <p>It was less than two decades ago that the N.B.A. was truly home-grown. Mutombo recalls growing up in Kinshasa, the capital of what was then known as Zaire.</p>
        <p>''My school was next to the American embassy,'' he recalled. ''We would be invited to the cultural center to watch tapes about America. A friend from the University of Kentucky showed me a tape about Georgetown playing Kentucky in the semifinals. I became a fan of Georgetown from that.''</p>
        <p>He followed Patrick Ewing -- born in Jamaica, now an American -- to Georgetown, and considers Olajuwon and Ewing as his role models.</p>
        <p>Change came quickly in Europe. Kremlinologists claimed to be shocked, but the tip-off had come around 1988 when Arvydas Sabonis refused to speak the same language as his Soviet Union coach.</p>
        <p>''I Lithuanian,'' he once rumbled to an American news conference. ''I no speak Russian anymore.''</p>
        <p>Sabonis eventually got to play for a Lithuanian national team, and now plays for Portland, and has been followed by many other Europeans.</p>
        <p>''I remember my mother put new wallpaper in our apartment,'' said Potapenko, who grew up in Kiev. ''I put my posters of N.B.A. players over half the wall. I used clips so I didn't hurt the wallpaper, but my mother was mad anyway.</p>
        <p>''My favorite player was Larry Johnson with Charlotte,'' Potapenko said. ''He was the best No. 4 position player, you know, big forward.''</p>
        <p>''I watched tapes and imitated the wide-open defensive stance they use in the N.B.A.,'' he added. ''My coach on the national under-20 team was mad because my feet were so wide apart, but I wanted to play like Larry Johnson.''</p>
        <p>One seminal player from Europe was Drazen Petrovic, the great shooter of the Nets from Croatia, who died in an auto accident on the German autobahn.</p>
        <p>Petro was shameless in firing up his shots, and fearless against the Jordans and Pippens, destroying some of the mystique that European players had to be robotic second-line functionaries in the N.B.A.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, European players can aspire to become Larry Johnson. And kids in New York, like Richard Holbrooke a few decades ago, could do worse than aspiring to be the next Drazen Petrovic. The court seems to have shrunk. The world certainly has.</p>
