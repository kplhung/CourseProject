        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I agree that parents should try to reclaim their children's time (news article, June 13). Children are over-scheduled with activities and penalized severely if they do not attend football practices or dance classes for any reason, even doctors' appointments.

        <p>Make no mistake: the student who does not take part in the programs as they currently exist will be put in the reject pile by the competitive colleges. These colleges put almost as much emphasis on these activities as they do on academic achievement. Until the colleges stop this practice, the students and parents will have to make their decision to spend more time together very carefully, knowing that it can and almost certainly will affect their college acceptances.</p>
