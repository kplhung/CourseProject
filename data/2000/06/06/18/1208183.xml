        <p>FORGET Hollywood. Long Island has its own fantasy factory, located right on Main Street in the middle of Westhampton Beach.</p>
        <p>It's called the Paraskevas Gallery. And it's where you can find Betty Paraskevas and her son, Michael, surrounded by paintings of some of the whimsical creatures and comic characters that populate the books, illustrations and television programs they create.</p>
        <p>During the summer, on most evenings, they are at the store, holding court as passers-by -- friends and strangers alike -- stop in and schmooze. ''We call it our clubhouse,'' Mrs. Paraskevas said in her husky voice, laughing as she lighted a little brown cigarette. Her 38-year-old son stopped momentarily to nod in agreement. Otherwise, he was a blur, dashing around, pointing out the latest drawing, playing the most recent videotape.</p>
        <p>In their collaboration, Betty is the wordsmith while Mickey -- everyone calls him Mickey -- is the artist. They began working together just over a decade ago, when Mr. Paraskevas, already a successful illustrator in Manhattan, moved back to Long Island and asked his mother to write the text for a series of drawings he was doing for Dan's Papers, a free-distribution weekly magazine. Though she had no formal writing experience, she had a theatrical bent, having worked on shows like ''Sugar Babies'' for the theater producer Harry Rigby. So she agreed to give it a try, and thus was born ''Junior Kroll,'' an irreverent youngster with a rhyming, acid tongue who quickly became a local favorite.</p>
        <p>With mother writing and son drawing, the two have authored and illustrated more than 15 children's books in the intervening years, many of them in verse, including ''On the Edge of the Sea,'' where a narrator recalls a childhood dream, as well as the recent ''Hoppy and Joe,'' about a dog and a seagull. They have also designed the stuffed animals and other assorted paraphernalia that nowadays are the inevitable accompaniment to any successful children's publishing venture. And they have created a number of animated children's television programs, among them ''The Kids in Room 402,'' a series now running on the Fox Family cable network; ''Marvin the Tap-Dancing Horse,'' another series, which will begin on PBS this fall; and ''The Tangerine Bear,'' a big-budget, celebrity-packed special (including the voices of Tom Bosley, Howie Mandel and David Hyde Pierce) set to air this December on ABC.</p>
        <p>Their latest project? ''Maggie and the Ferocious Beast,'' featuring a sassy, red-haired little girl named Maggie and her friends, a pig named Hamilton Hocks and the Beast, a giant monster who has red polka dots on his bright yellow hide. The half-hour series recently made its debut on Nick Jr., a weekday morning programming block for young children seen nationwide on Nickelodeon cable television.</p>
        <p>''Maggie started out with a map,'' said Mr. Paraskevas, and with the beast, who had figured in a book that he and his mother wrote in 1996, ''The Ferocious Beast With the Polka-Dot Hide.'' Including such Long Island-inspired landmarks as the Big Duck and Billy's River of Dreams (for Billy Joel, a fan who has been featured in ''Junior Kroll''), the map depicted ''Nowhere Land,'' the place where Maggie and the others are supposed to live. It served as the springboard for the characters, who were developed in conjunction with Nelvana, a Toronto-based company that is producing the series.</p>
        <p>From Nelvana, the idea was taken to Nickelodeon where Brown Johnson, senior vice president of Nick Jr., snapped it up. The network began testing two-minute segments of the show a couple of years ago, she said, and it ''proved itself'' almost immediately for the target audience, children from 2 to 5 years old.</p>
        <p>''Kids understand the stories, which are all about friendship,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''And they don't talk down to them.''</p>
        <p>The relatively sophisticated tone is deliberate, according to Mrs. Paraskevas. ''Kids are very sharp today,'' she said. ''You have to give them something funny, but it also has to be good.'' She said that she and her son came up with Maggie together, like most of their ideas, and that the characters evolved slowly, over time, as a joint effort.</p>
        <p>Still, don't they get on each other's nerves now and then? No, said Mrs. Paraskevas, who calls their collaboration ''very easy.'' She and her son share a Southampton house with Mr. Paraskevas's father, Paul, a retired oil company executive who helps out with the business end of things (a daughter, Judy, lives in New Jersey). They ''get along very well,'' she said, sharing ''the same sense of humor'' and a commitment to their current projects, which include an illustrated book about tall ships, just published, a forthcoming video about a cartoon rabbit, ''Nibbles O'Hare,'' and, of course, weekly drawings for Dan's Papers.</p>
        <p>How do they find time to do it all?</p>
        <p>''We're so busy, we never get to the beach,'' Mrs. Paraskevas said.</p>
        <p>''Or sleep,'' her son added.</p>
