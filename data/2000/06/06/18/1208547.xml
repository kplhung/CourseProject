        <p>Two boys were slain yesterday -- one of them by his 12-year-old brother -- in unrelated incidents in the Bronx and Brooklyn, the police said.</p>
        <p>The first slaying took place early yesterday, when Japhet Rojas, 10, was killed by his 12-year-old brother in an apartment at 2767 Morris Avenue in the Bedford Park section of the Bronx, the police said, adding that the victim was autistic.</p>
        <p>''It's unclear at this point what the cause of death was,'' said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>Although the medical examiner's office ruled the incident a homicide yesterday afternoon, the police did not have further details, he said.</p>
        <p>The victim's brother was arrested and charged with homicide, Detective Pentangelo said.</p>
        <p>Japhet's body was discovered yesterday morning in his bed by his sister, who called the police around 6:30 a.m., the police said.</p>
        <p>After the incident was ruled a homicide, police officers arrested the 12-year-old, whose name was withheld by the police.</p>
        <p>The second killing took place around 2:20 p.m. outside 720 Elderts Lane in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, when a gunman, 16, shot a 15-year-old youth in the chest after demanding money and jewelry, the police said.</p>
        <p>Emergency workers arrived minutes later and took the victim to Brookdale Hospital, where he died shortly afterward, Detective Pentangelo said.</p>
        <p>The police were still searching for the gunman last night. They did not release the victim's name because his family had not been notified.</p>
