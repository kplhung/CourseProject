        <p>A 513-acre strip of private land -- described by one conservationist as the mouth between the western jaws of Clarence Fahnestock State Park in Putnam County -- has been purchased by New York State, providing increased public access to the rocky outcroppings that offer broad views along the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>Governor George E. Pataki announced the $2 million purchase on June 6. The funds are to come from the state's Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act.</p>

        <p>A 513-acre strip of private land -- described by one conservationist as the mouth between the western jaws of Clarence Fahnestock State Park in Putnam County -- has been purchased by New York State, providing increased public access to the rocky outcroppings that offer broad views along the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>Governor George E. Pataki announced the $2 million purchase on June 6. The funds are to come from the state's Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act.</p>
        <p>''It is hilly, forested terrain stretching between Route 301 and Indian Brook Road in Garrison, N.Y.,'' said Erik Kulleseid, the state director of the Trust for Public Land. The trust, along with another not-for-profit conservation group, the Open Space Institute, arranged the deal between the state and a private family that owned the completely undeveloped property that juts into the 11,000-acre park.</p>
        <p>In the early 1990's, plans to build about 50 private homes on the land fell through during the last recession.</p>
        <p>''The area we are talking about is the western end of the park,'' Mr. Kulleseid said. ''There are two long extensions, like jaws, and this property will sort of fill in the mouth.'' Besides the views from the outcroppings above the Hudson, Mr. Kulleseid said, ''this is going to create even longer hiking trails through Fahnestock.''</p>
