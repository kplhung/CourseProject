        <p>MARK COHEN, though only 18, has a knack for letting a moment grow pregnant.  ''This,'' he starts, before making the 11 people in front of him wait a beat, ''is our last big push.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen is the president of the Student Council at Horace Greeley High School here, and the push is to organize the election that will yield his successor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen's own rise to power at Greeley was steady, aided by a flair for the outlandish. Two years ago, when he ran for social vice president, the overseer of school social life, he sensed that the student body wanted a Good Time Charlie, so he delivered his campaign speech dressed as Austin Powers. He rode a wave of appreciative laughter to victory.</p>
        <p>When he ran for the highest office in the school the next year, Cohen-as-Powers arrived at the speeches once more. At the podium, though, he stripped off his Powers disguise and delivered the speech in a suit and tie, pointing up his serious side.</p>
        <p>The Student Council presidency is not all about stunts, though. There is a lot at stake.</p>
        <p>For one, the Student Council dispenses $30,000 to clubs and events. Secondly, there are few things that gild a college application more than being the Student Council president. But perhaps most important, in the ground war that is high school popularity, the Student Council president ranks high.</p>
        <p>The lone requirement for running is to get 25 signatures on a petition. Despite this low barrier, only three students qualified.</p>
        <p>Compared with the long slogs that are national campaigns, this election can be tracked with an egg timer.</p>
        <p>After a week of retail politics in the lunchroom and hallways, candidate speeches are held. Candidates get four minutes each to make their case. Afterward, voting booths, trucked in for the occasion, are opened. Winners are announced at the end of the school day, with the order of finish kept secret to protect feelings.</p>
        <p>First up is Kate Aaby, currently social vice president. She walks to the podium quickly, and over her clothes she wears a pink silk belt adorned with beads. The case she makes for herself is well tuned and steadily spoken.</p>
        <p>Ms. Aaby is standing on the springboard of the social vice presidency, but she obviously foresees danger in being boxed in as a student council hack. So, using a nimbleness that a grown-up incumbent would envy, she terms her experience something that will merely ''act as a foundation.''</p>
        <p>This brings Ms. Aaby to the crux of her outsider-on-the-inside campaign:  ''If you have the safety of experience, why not shake things up a bit?'' With that, Ms. Aaby steps to the side of the podium and does a belly dance. As a punctuation mark to a stump speech, it is a political master stroke that brings the house down.</p>
        <p>Next up is the junior class president, Jason Davis. A thin and handsome 17-year-old, he is dressed in a solid blue shirt, his inky hair parted smartly to the side. His speaking style is calm and soothing, and one cannot help comparing the natural fluidity of Mr. Davis and Ms. Aaby with the frequently disjointed and ungrammatical sentences of many recent candidates for national office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis gives himself a verbal pat on the back for doubling class funds as junior class president, but his platform seems a bit narrow in its appeal. He advocates Advanced Placement reading days, something that elicits only a few pockets of less-than-rowdy cheers. He is also a proponent of more student influence on tenure decisions -- not a world beater of an idea in the wake of a belly dance.</p>
        <p>The final candidate is Andrew Meyer, a tennis and basketball player. He is draped in an American flag and, at 6-foot-4, takes large strides to the podium. He is greeted with packs of throaty cheers from what certainly sounds like athletic teams.</p>
        <p>He sets right to work explaining the flag: ''Every country and organization has one, but we don't.'' A Meyer administration would create a Greeley flag, he promises. That way, when they play other schools in sports, the first thing they'll do is stake down their flag. ''It's going to be,'' he said, wistfully, ''like a walk on the moon.''</p>
        <p>This garners even more throaty cheers from the athletic set, but Mr. Meyer is savvy enough to widen his appeal. He speaks of the need to unite the entire student body. ''It's time we got drunk together,'' he roars with populist glee, before casting a playful smile at the worried-looking teachers in the room, ''on brotherhood, sisterhood and good feeling.''</p>
        <p>The room shakes with the laughter of what sounds like all 1,000 students, and Mr. Meyer uses this line as a refrain two more times, accumulating political capital each time. He strides off the podium, looking like Mr. Sizzle.</p>
        <p>No post-speech spin control for these candidates. For two of the adolescent politicians, the dread of defeat weighs heavily. Asked where he will be when the election results are announced, Mr. Davis looks down and says quietly, ''probably hiding in some corner of the school.''</p>
        <p>And despite the great reception accorded her belly dance, Ms. Aaby asked a reporter a question before he could get one out himself: ''Oh, do you think Andrew Meyer killed me?'' Only Mr. Meyer isn't worried about defeat. ''I'll just move on,'' he said, with a shrug. ''Athlete's memory, you get over it quickly.''</p>
        <p>The voting is supervised by 12 P.T.A. parents. It goes smoothly, save for a minor incident in which a freshman who had never been in a booth before got stuck. ''Help,'' he yelled from behind the curtain, ''I can't get out.''</p>
        <p>By 2:35, 579 out of 980 students had exercised their voting rights. This came to 59 percent, a respectable turnout considering that seniors, with little at stake, tend not to vote in large numbers.</p>
        <p>The results are tabulated, and then Mr. Cohen, a lame duck at 18, walks toward the main office to announce the name of the winner on the public address system.</p>
        <p>''The winner of the Student Council presidency,'' he said, before pausing a beat, ''is Andrew Meyer.''</p>
