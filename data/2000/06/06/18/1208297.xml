        <p>Sara's Center, a day-care facility in Great Neck for adults with chronic mental illness, faced a crisis in April when the woman who had founded it  announced her plans to retire. But ''a windfall of donations has kept us alive,'' said Edward A. Regensburg, the executive director.</p>
        <p>Marion Berliner, who founded the center in 1976, had said she would sell the colonial home to the center for below its market value, but Mr. Regensburg said he feared ''that continuing high attendance and the prospect of not receiving any increases in Medicaid reimbursements would increase operating costs beyond our capacity to carry the mortgage.''</p>

        <p>Sara's Center, a day-care facility in Great Neck for adults with chronic mental illness, faced a crisis in April when the woman who had founded it  announced her plans to retire. But ''a windfall of donations has kept us alive,'' said Edward A. Regensburg, the executive director.</p>
        <p>Marion Berliner, who founded the center in 1976, had said she would sell the colonial home to the center for below its market value, but Mr. Regensburg said he feared ''that continuing high attendance and the prospect of not receiving any increases in Medicaid reimbursements would increase operating costs beyond our capacity to carry the mortgage.''</p>
        <p>When the problem became known, Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli, Democrat of Great Neck, obtained a $50,000 appropriation from the state. In addition, Christopher Ranch of Edison, N.J., a leading producer of fresh garlic products, donated $9,000 in the name of A.&amp;P. supermarkets. Additional donations from the clients' families and other individuals made the total $70,000.</p>
        <p>At the end of this month, Mr. Regensburg plans to purchase Sara's Center.</p>
        <p>''We'll still need over $400,000 to pay off our mortgage,'' he said, ''and to make sure that our salaries stay competitive. But when our cry for help went out, the response showed that there are people out there who care a lot about what happens to the forgotten members of our society.''</p>
