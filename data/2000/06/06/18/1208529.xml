        <p>In a study of runway safety, the National Transportation Safety Board cited an increased risk of on-the-ground collisions, and an increase in the number of times that planes or trucks blunder onto active runways. The Federal Aviation Administration has plans for a computer system to provide warnings, but it is 10 years behind schedule and the board said it was insufficient anyway. The board proposed procedural changes as a short-term fix, but said those changes might worsen airport congestion.</p>
