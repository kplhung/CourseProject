        <p>THE images sent imaginations soaring.</p>
        <p>On the airport tarmac in Pyongyang last Tuesday, the reclusive, elusive leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Il, reached forward and greeted his guest, President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea, with an honor guard and a gripping, two-handed handshake. Behind the grins, it was tempting to see a melting of a half-century of hostility across the Korean peninsula, one of the world's most dangerous flashpoints.</p>
        <p>Half a world away, Bashar al-Assad, a 34-year-old British-educated eye doctor who is the new ruler of Syria, stood stoically near the flag-draped coffin of his father, President Hafez al-Assad, receiving condolences from a parade of visiting foreign princes and dignitaries. One of those visitors was Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, expressing hope -- ever so tentatively -- that the new Syrian leader might cool off the most enduringly hostile corner of the Middle East.</p>
        <p>It was, of course, pure coincidence that the two events took place the same day. But beneath the surface, there are profound similarities in what was happening last week.</p>
        <p>Both North Korea and Syria are relics of another age -- dictatorships based on internal terror and hostility to external neighbors, threatening to explode at any time in new conflict. And now Syria, like North Korea six years ago, has embarked on a dynastic transition that may -- or may not -- give reason to hope for an easing of those tensions.</p>
        <p>In each place, power has passed from a dictator to his son, and the son shows signs of a more modern, outward-looking approach to solving his country's deep problems. Perhaps that can make the world more peaceful.</p>
        <p>But there is also the disquieting feeling that it won't be easy; terror and isolation remain hallmarks of the systems in which these two sons rule, and whether they can -- or even want to -- tame parts of those systems may be the most important factors in determining whether a real transformation is under way. Change, for both sons, will be risky: moving from a terror-based society to a more open one always is.</p>
        <p>In the case of North Korea, Kim Jong Il appears to have made a strategic, possibly desperate, decision to reach out to the rest of the world. Even before he pledged during the summit that he would visit South Korea, he established diplomatic relations with Italy and secretly visited China. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has said he will visit North Korea next month, and Japan is negotiating a possible resumption of relations.</p>
        <p>In the case of Syria, the younger Mr. Assad, an English- and French-speaking Internet enthusiast in a country where free speech is a fantasy and the Internet has been branded a threat to security, made clear even before he assumed the reins of power that he was different from his father. ''I am not one of those who keeps power for himself,'' he told the Egyptian weekly Al Ousboua in an interview before his father's death. ''I believe in the need to open up to all opinions and listen to all viewpoints.''</p>
        <p>But for both men, success is not at all guaranteed, and for remarkably similar reasons. Neither Kim Jong Il nor Bashar al-Assad got his job the way his father did -- as a military leader who grabbed and consolidated power. Even though both countries are called ''republics,'' the sons did not get their jobs because of the will of the people. They did not even get their jobs in the most traditional dynastic way -- through the legitimacy implicit in royal blood lines.</p>
        <p>Rather, the two sons came into power only because of the political manipulations of their fathers while they were alive, abetted after their deaths by military and terror apparatuses bequeathed to the sons as pillars of their respective systems.  That means that their claim to legitimacy is dangerously thin, and any bold move either at home or abroad is fraught with risks. Both men's fathers left them societies in bad economic shape, North Korea's  disastrously so. Westerners sometimes see that as a force dictating an opening to the outside world. But both sons must be aware that a wrong move in that direction could bring down the wrath of the military or the ruling party. At the same time, isolating potential rivals and suddenly placing new power in the hands of foreign businessmen, or the press, or the people themselves, could bring down the entire structure of power.</p>
        <p>IN North Korea's case, for example, Mr. Kim inherited the most isolated regime in the world, one whose people have been fed an extraordinary stream of propaganda and one where any sudden influx of real information about how much better the outside world lives could be enormously destabilizing and dangerous to the leader.</p>
        <p>Consider the history of efforts to remove terror from a politicial system without bringing it down.</p>
        <p>The Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev tried and failed outright; his  system was too brittle to withstand the sweeping societal, economic and political changes he envisioned. It simply collapsed.</p>
        <p>China, wary of Mr. Gorbachev's mistakes, is experimenting with retaining its Communist Party structure and autocratic government while opening up its economy to capitalism and foreign investment; the ultimate outcome of this juggling act is not at all certain either.</p>
        <p>And in Syria's ally Iran, yet another kind of risky transitional experiment is under way. There clerical leaders are mixing two volatile chemicals -- Islam and democracy -- in a struggle to reconcile representative government and the rule of law with theocracy.</p>
        <p>In North Korea, despite Kim Jong Il's opening to the world, there is no evidence that he intends to open up the political system for his starving population at home. North Korea is so closed, its people apparently so quiescent, that when he postponed the summit for a day, he felt no need to explain why. He could quip that he knew all about South Korea from watching its television for years, a right that is denied to his citizens, whose sole radio station blares government propaganda that good citizens are expected to leave on all day long. In fact, most of the images of the two leaders meeting that were beamed to South Korea were not shown in the North. Virtually no foreigners were allowed to attend the summit in Pyongyang.</p>
        <p>''I don't see the decision to engage as a decision to open up North Korean society,'' said Stephen Linton, a Korea expert and chairman of the nonprofit Eugene Bell Foundation, created to fight tuberculosis in North Korea. ''These folks are not frustrated democrats. They have never been educated to question authority. On the contrary, they have been educated to be loyal to their leader. Unanimity is a public virtue here.''</p>
        <p>Even to Mr. Linton, who has spent considerable time in North Korea over the years, the country is a black hole. ''Thirty to 40 years into Korean studies, I have no idea where this is going,'' he said. ''It's humbling.''</p>
        <p>In Syria, a Mediterranean country with a long mercantile tradition, the people are much less isolated and more politically sophisticated. Despite the closed nature of Syrian society and the authoritarian system of decision-making today, many Syrians remember the 1950's, when they enjoyed democratic rights under a multiparty system. But they also remember that the period of democracy ended in a series of coups; it is the kind of denouement that sours repressive societies on the soft side of democracy, and surely there is no nostalgia for that kind of instability, even in the Syria of the Assads.</p>
        <p>STILL, because of the stakes for peace in general, it is to be expected that the outside world is lining up to nudge both North Korea and, to a lesser extent, Syria, to achieve reasonable relationships with their neighbors.</p>
        <p>In North Korea's case, China in particular has reason to act: it has cultivated relationships with both North and South Korea and has endured an illegal influx of hundreds of thousands of North Koreans fleeing the country's economic crisis.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the United States is puzzling over what last week's showmanship means. Clinton administration officials aren't revising intelligence assessments about the need for a national missile defense that would define North Korea as the pre-eminent threat. In fact, one theory at  the Pentagon is that Kim Jong Il's  outreach could all be a plot orchestrated by Russia to derail an American limited missile defense initiative. ''Nothing North Korea does short of merging with the South and democratizing would change our calculation about the threat,'' one senior administration official said.</p>
        <p>With Syria, the signs are more subtle. Both before and since Hafez al-Assad's death, the United States has said that it sees little chance in the short term for progress toward an Israeli-Syrian peace. Israeli officials are also pessimistic, although some have painted the new Syrian leader in a positive light.</p>
        <p>Compounding the problem is that both societies are controlled at the top, leaving outsiders little leverage to affect change except through formal state-to-state relations. There are no parliaments or newspapers or independent groups to bond with.</p>
        <p>''These highly autocratic regimes can use their international connections to enhance their domestic positions and extract concessions from the outside world,'' said Stephen D. Krasner, a political science professor at Stanford University. ''But the nature of these regimes also limits the ability of external actors to alter policies.'' In other words, even those intriguing images last week of outsiders invited in can be used to keep these societies closed.</p>
