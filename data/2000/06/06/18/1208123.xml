        <p>Jeff Kallet letter on Sara Davidson's May 21 article on Ram Dass's stroke questions whether he feels that living closer to death exempts those seeking awareness from discipline he once endorsed</p>

        <p>Perhaps, after all he has been through, Ram Dass deserves the benefit of a quick and easy fix. Yet, I couldn't help laughing when he told Sara Davidson that ''pot works faster'' than meditation in achieving ''soul perspective.'' Immediate gratification has been criticized as an American malaise, marked by selfishness, impatience and immaturity. I wonder if Ram Dass feels that living closer to one's death -- with less time to spare -- exempts those seeking awareness from the effort and discipline he once apparently endorsed. His remark also reminded me of the contradictions that Zen teachers sometimes throw at their students to keep them off-balance.</p>
