        <p>A strange thing happened to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani last week.

        <p>Things on the show rapidly deteriorated, at least from the mayor's perspective, as the caller, ''Keith from Washington Heights,'' who described himself as a big ''Rudy supporter,'' finished off with the ultimate insult.

        <p>A strange thing happened to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani last week. A caller to his weekly radio show asked the tough-on-crime mayor why he had suddenly gone soft -- specifically, why a Central Park mob had been allowed to sexually assault dozens of women last Sunday while the police, the caller said, did nothing.</p>
        <p>Things on the show rapidly deteriorated, at least from the mayor's perspective, as the caller, ''Keith from Washington Heights,'' who described himself as a big ''Rudy supporter,'' finished off with the ultimate insult. He compared Sunday's Central Park attacks to the 1991 Crown Heights disturbance, when a black mob killed a Jewish scholar and the Dinkins administration allowed the violence to continue for three days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, who reviles former Mayor David N. Dinkins, did not take well to the analogy. ''Maybe the picture you get is not the absolutely accurate picture,'' he responded testily, his ''New Rudy'' demeanor forgotten. ''Did you ever consider that?''</p>
        <p>A short time later, Mr. Giuliani was hit from the other side: a 248-page report from the United States Civil Rights Commission released on Friday urged the appointment of independent prosecutors to investigate any serious future accusations of police brutality.</p>
        <p>It also said the New York City Police Department engaged in extensive racial profiling in stop-and-frisk tactics against blacks and Hispanics. Mr. Giuliani's response, in a written statement, was swift: ''Once again the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights has embarrassed itself by releasing a politicized report that bears no relation to reality.''</p>
        <p>There has always been a siege mentality in the Giuliani-era City Hall, an ''us against the world'' leitmotif that a Republican mayor in a Democratic city has used as inspiration as he pushes forward with unpopular programs. But last week was the first time that Mr. Giuliani was attacked simultaneously on both flanks, for a police department said to be both too aggressive and not aggressive enough. ''Maybe we're in a period of time in which the police can't win,'' Mr. Giuliani said on the radio show.</p>
        <p>Those at City Hall said the same of themselves, particularly during a week when the lines in a predictable world of enemies and friends became blurred. The New York Post, the mayor's longtime supporter,  compared Mr. Giuliani's reaction to the Central Park attacks (''tepid -- indeed, downright defensive'') with the reaction of Mr. Dinkins to the fatal stabbing of a tourist from Utah during a robbery attempt in the subway in 1990 (''lethargic, befuddled'').</p>
        <p>''You can't win! You can't win!'' groused one of the mayor's most senior advisers. But he also took on a war-weary tone. ''It's no different now,'' he said, ''than it was six years ago.''</p>
        <p>Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island borough president and a longtime friend of the mayor's, expressed similar sentiments of victimhood. ''You're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't,'' he said. ''If you have an incident where the police go over the line, everybody attacks the mayor. And if you have an incident like Central Park, everybody attacks the mayor.''</p>
        <p>Raymond B. Harding, the chairman of the Liberal Party and another old friend of Mr. Giuliani's, also reflected this view from City Hall: ''The main focus out of the Central Park melee following the Puerto Rican Day Parade has been the police reaction. The first issue is that this kind of a melee occurred. I have not heard sufficient condemnation of that. I hear condemnation of the police. I find myself in a topsy-turvy world.''</p>
        <p>So topsy-turvy, in fact, that the mayor did something very rare for him last week: he criticized the police. After his initial mild response to the attacks on Monday morning -- a time when many of the victims had not yet come forward -- Mr. Giuliani roared back with damage control for the rest of the week, denouncing what many of the women described as police brush-offs and promising punishment of the officers if the claims were found to be true. He also called the women's experiences ''horrendous'' after he met with several victims.</p>
        <p>''One described to me a situation in which the police did not respond properly, which I thought was quite credible, and totally inexcusable,'' the mayor said at a news conference. ''And she is prepared to identify the two police officers that did not respond, and I believe she can, because she was able to give me physical descriptions of them.''</p>
        <p>Suddenly, a lame-duck mayor who has said he wants to spend his last 18 months in office redefining his legacy with the poor and minorities found the centerpiece of his legacy -- crime control -- under attack. Videotapes of the assaults opened the ''Today'' show on Wednesday morning, playing in kitchens and living rooms all over the country, followed by Mr. Giuliani assuring Matt Lauer that New York City was still safe.</p>
        <p>It was just the kind of crisis the mayor had always feared when he was running for the United States Senate. What if it had happened when he was upstate? How would it have played with his political contributors in the heartland, who often cited the city's renaissance as a reason for their support?</p>
        <p>''Rudy Giuliani is the man who tamed New York,'' said George Arzt, the Democratic political consultant. ''And suddenly you have an out-of-control group. People are thinking, 'Are we going back to wilding and whirlpooling and all of those things that have left our vocabulary?' This is part of his legacy that at least momentarily seems to be growing a wart.''</p>
        <p>Clearly, Mr. Giuliani was outraged by the comparison to Crown Heights, and berated ''Keith from Washington Heights'' in vintage mayoral style. ''This did not take place all day,'' he said in a response so long that at the end his words were drowned out by the show's closing music. ''It didn't take place overnight. It didn't go on forever and ever and ever. It did go on longer than it should. Maybe a half-hour, maybe 45 minutes, maybe an hour. But to make a comparison to something that went on for hours and hours and for four days is a totally, you know, exaggerated reaction.''</p>
