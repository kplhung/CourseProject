        <p>CHILDREN know their place, or ought to. And mothers are mothers, those natural-born nurturers. But fathers, after all these years, are still hunters, searhing for their perfect role.</p>
        <p>The search begins in places like the maternity ward at North Shore University Hospital here, where the babies are cute, the mothers maternal and the fathers a mixed bag. They all know that, as one new father said, the days of ''Me Ug, you Woman'' are long gone. But now what?</p>
        <p>''Now we're expected to do mroe in terms of changin diapers and formula and getting up in the middle of the night,'' said Jonathan Klein, 31, a podistrist whose first child was born last week. But on Day 2 of Dr. Klein's grand adventure, with his wife recovering in bed and far-off visions of tossing a ball to young Eric Matthew just setting in, the babe was suddenly wailing. Dr. Klein scrambled for support staff. ''I'm looking for the phone,'' he recalled, ''to call her mother, my mother. Where the hell is everyone?''</p>
        <p>He was never big on holding babies. But when his was born, ''they handed him to me,'' he said. ''I had no choice.''</p>
        <p>Not that he wanted a choice - just a road map - as he headed happily and inexorably toward his first Father's Day. After all, not all fathers are like that plumber down the hall who was handling his day-old daughter as expertly as he would PVC pipe.</p>
        <p>You might expect a plumber for the New York City Fire Department to be a hands-on guy. But this?</p>
        <p>''I was there for the whole thing,'' Pat Brazill, 30, said of his wife's 23 hours of labor with baby Kaitlyn. ''I didn't miss a minute of it. I even told the doctor to give me some tools. I'll help you out.''</p>
        <p>Actually, it's fathers who need help. The playing field of parental responsibility is leveling. But for all the magazines and books advising fathers, they're still scrambling for footing. If mothers teeter on the high wire stretched between home and work, fathers are like Mr. Potato Heads, needlessly trying out combinations of parts. (How about the head of a Guinness Stout, the body of a Ferrari, the cool of Joe Torre and the portfolio of Anna Kournikova?)</p>
        <p>Eddie Jorge, 33, the manager of a lock-smith company in Queens and the father of a 21-month-old son, was rhapsodizing on fatherhood in a labor room with his very expectant wife, Yenny. He loves arriving home from work to the squeal of ''Daddy!'' or reading Disney books or watching television with his son, Dylan. ''I'll be watching basketball or baseball, and I'll say 'Look, there's the ball,' '' Mr. Jorge said, ''And he'll say, 'Ball, ball, ball.' ''</p>
        <p>He's exhilarated. ''I'm still trying to get used to the fact that I'm a father,'' he said. ''It still hasn't sunk in, 21 months later.''</p>
        <p>His wife's exhausted, braving contractions. Over the sound of the heart monitor, she said, ''It better sink in this time, right?''</p>
        <p>Rosemarie Ennis, a health educator at the hospital, said she was a bit taken aback when a man showed up alone at a breast-feeding class. ''I looked at him, and he said 'Why are you looking at me? My wife's not feeling well,' '' she said. Not surprisingly, ''he had the most questions.''</p>
        <p>EVEN among the newly minted fathers, you can pick out those who one day will be loudly working the cell phone on the soccer sideline or struggling to take a teenager's tattoo in stride. Not that fatherhood is predictable anymore.</p>
        <p>Brian Wendland grew up in a Long Island neighborhood with lots of firefighters who worked second jobs when they weren't dousing flames. Now a New York City firefighter, Mr. Wendland uses his unusual work schedule to care for his 3-year-old son most days. ''I actually hang out with another fireman who's a friend,'' he said, as his wife Andrea, a physician's assistant, was in labor with their second child. ''We'll go to places you can hang out with your kids, Chuck E. Cheese or Fun Zone.'' Their first time at Fun Zone, on a Wednesday, he said, ''I was with my friend and we were standing around and suddenly there were five of us. We were all firemen.''</p>
        <p>Every now and then, Paul Epstein, an anesthesiologist at the hospital and a father of three, turns to a soon-to-be-father as he's easing the pain of an expectant mother, and asks, ''Do you have any idea what you're getting into?''</p>
        <p>They never do.</p>
