        <p>Every summer, after the steel bonds of winter fall away, Montrealers leap forth for an outdoor season of street festivals, cafe-hopping, bicycling along canals or simply strolling streets imbued with the history of a city founded in 1642.</p>
        <p>This bubble of Latin culture,  the world's second-largest French-speaking city, after Paris, has drawn Americans since the days of Benjamin Franklin. Promoting itself this summer as ''Paris without jet lag,'' Montreal can now throw in ''without the long ride from the airport.'' All commercial air traffic now goes to Dorval International Airport, a 15-minute cab ride from downtown, as opposed to the 40-mile ride from Mirabel, the old airport.</p>
        <p>Then there is the money: restaurant checks may look steep, but subtract a third, because $1 American buys almost $1.50 Canadian.</p>
        <p>As Americans reserve Montreal hotel rooms at the fastest clip since the Expo 67 World's Fair, they will discover an attitude change here. Montreal is on the economic rebound as investors finally accept the ''French fact.'' With a huge concentration of college students, Montreal is churning out a French-speaking middle class. With the French language more dominant in Montreal than it has been since the 1760's, separatism is on the back burner and Quebecers are increasingly self-confident and outward looking.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>Fireworks set to music is the theme of the Benson &amp; Hedges International Fireworks Competition on 10 nights starting yesterday, ending July 30, over the old World's Fair grounds on Ile Ste.-Helene. Among the competitors are Japan, Germany, Italy and the United States. From 10 p.m. Seats range from $21 to $28 and can be ordered from (800) 361-4595. Information: (514) 872-6222.</p>
        <p>The Montreal Jazz Festival will include 400 concerts, 300 of them free, largely in and around Place des Arts downtown, from June 29 to July 9. It is dedicated to Louis Armstrong and is expected to draw 2,000 musicians and an audience of 1.5 million. Among the performers expected are the trumpet player Arturo Sandoval, the bassist Dave Holland and the vocalist Ranee Lee. Information: (888) 515-0515. Schedules and ticket sales at www.montrealjazzfest.com.</p>
        <p>The last weekend of the jazz festival, July 7 to 9, is also the weekend for Carifiesta, Montreal's Caribbean carnival. Like almost everything else here, the festival has a French touch, drawing on the traditions of Guadeloupe, Haiti and Martinique, with blasting bands to lure 150,000 people into the streets. A parade will be followed by a free party at the Champ-de-Mars, behind city hall. Information: (514) 735-2232.</p>
        <p>The Afro beat picks up July 13 with Nuits d'Afrique for 10 days, some 30 concerts and nearly 300 musicians from Africa, the Caribbean and Black America. Information: (514) 499-9239. The schedule includes Miriam Makeba on opening night at the Spectrum nightclub (tickets $35) and Tiken Jah Fakoly, reggae singer from the Ivory Coast, in one of the free nightly concerts at Place Emilie-Gamelin.</p>
        <p>What's so funny about Montreal? Find out at the Just for Laughs festival, July 13 to 23. Many of the 1,500 performances in French and English by stand-up comics and troupes from around the world will be free on outdoor stages along Rue St.-Denis. Among the headliners are Tim Allen, Eric Idle and William Shatner. For information, call (514) 845-3155 or visit www.hahaha.com.</p>
        <p>July finishes with the Lesbian and Gay Pride celebration on the 31st. It draws from all over North America, with attendance expected to hit half a million for the Pride Parade on the last day, Aug. 6. An outdoor big-band concert is planned for Emilie-Gamelin Park at 8 p.m. on Aug. 1, and a street fair will take place at Ste.-Catherine East between Berri and Papineau on Aug. 5. Information: (514) 285-4011.</p>
        <p>Through Oct. 15, the Museum of Fine Arts, 1380 Sherbrooke West, (514) 285-2000, will display 81 paintings, including Cezannes, Renoirs and Picassos, on loan from  the Musee de l'Orangerie in Paris through Oct. 15. Open daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission $10.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>The delights of a Montreal summer require footwork: strolling centuries-old blocks and streets, inspecting architectural details, reading historic plaques, window shopping on streets lined with antiques shops, or sipping an allonge coffee at a sidewalk cafe. The best neighborhoods for walks are Vieux-Port, the Old Port section where the city began life 358 years ago; the Rue St.-Denis restaurant, cafe and shopping streets; and Rue Ste.-Catherine, the shopping and entertainment district.</p>
        <p>For $13.50, the Montreal Museum Pass allows holders to visit 21 museums over two days. A good place to start is just off the docks in the old port section. The new Pointe-a-Calliere Montreal Museum of Archaeology and History, Place Royale at Rue de la Commune, offers visitors a good background on the city's development, starting with a fast-paced, Monty Python-style bilingual multimedia show on Montreal's history. The tower provides a bird's-eye view of Old Montreal and the St. Lawrence River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday to Friday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekends; (514) 872-9150. Admission $5.75, $2 ages 6 to 12.</p>
        <p>If you need a break from the heat (yes, it can happen even in Montreal), slip into the cool and soothing, robin's-egg-blue interior of Notre-Dame Basilica, about three blocks up the hill from the history museum, at 110 Rue Notre-Dame West. This graceful Gothic Revival church was believed to be the largest religious edifice in North America when it opened in 1829. The architect, a New Yorker named James O'Donnell, was so taken with its soaring, gold-leaf interior and stained-glass windows depicting the history of Montreal that he converted to Catholicism in order to be buried there. Admission is $1.35.</p>
        <p>Four blocks away, at the corner  of Rue St.-Laurent and the river, Cirque du Soleil, the cultural ambassadors of modern Montreal, offer their first large-screen film, ''Journey of Man,'' at the IMAX Old Port. Filmed all over the world, it follows a child as he travels from birth to adulthood. $8.45, seniors and teenagers $7. Information: (514) 496-4629 or www.imaxoldport.com.</p>
        <p>The Montreal Botanical Garden, 4101 Sherbrooke East, one of the world's largest, hits full bloom in late June. With 21,000 species of plant, the gardens sprawl over 30 acres, ranging from formal European gardens, to a Chinese pavilion in the style of the Ming Dynasty, to a 16-acre arboretum and 10 exhibition greenhouses. Admission $6.45, seniors and students $4.75, ages 6 to 17 $3.20; (514) 872-1400.</p>
        <p>After stopping to smell the roses, you may desire more vigorous activity. There's bicycling along an eight-mile lighted, paved path from Rene Levesque Park to the Pere Marquette Promenade, a route that passes by the Lachine Rapids. Bikes can be rented at any of several kiosks in the Old Port.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>American tourism is expected to surge this summer, so expect higher seasonal rates. Rooms can be scarce during major festivals.</p>
        <p>With 487 spacious rooms, the Holiday Inn Montreal-Midtown, 420 Sherbrooke Street West, (514) 842-6111, fax (514) 842-9381, is a good bet during the peak season. Many of the rooms have views along Sherbrooke, Montreal's Fifth Avenue. Doubles are $114 to $150.</p>
        <p>For the charm of Old Montreal, the Auberge du Vieux-Port, 97 Rue de la Commune East, (888) 660-7678, fax (514) 876-8923, is a late-19th-century stone building converted to a hotel. The 27 neo-classical rooms, in great demand, have brass beds, stone or brick walls, and large casement windows overlooking the port docks. Doubles are $129 to $179, including full breakfast.</p>
        <p>Budget: At the junction of the busy bar, restaurant and boutique scene, at the corner of Rue Ste.-Catherine and Rue Crescent, the Comfort Suites, 1214 Rue Crescent, (514) 878-2711, fax (514) 878-0030, offers 96 simple, comfortable rooms, each with balcony. Doubles: $80 to $112.</p>
        <p>One block to the east, the Novotel, 1180 Rue de la Montagne, (514) 861-6000, fax (514) 861-0992, offers slightly higher priced rooms on a street lined with boutiques and restaurants. The 227 rooms have bright, modern decor, and there is a fitness center. Doubles: $87 to $135.</p>
        <p>Luxury: The Ritz-Carlton Montreal, 1228 Sherbrooke West, (514) 842-4212, fax (514) 842-4907, the 88-year-old empress of Montreal's Golden Mile, has just emerged from a renovation that added luster to its marble bathrooms, its rooms appointed with antiques, and to its piano bar and delightful garden restaurant. The turn-of-the-century ambience melds nicely with two-line phones in the 229 rooms. Doubles are $288.</p>
        <p>The largest of half a dozen inns to open in historic buildings in old Montreal in recent years, the Auberge Bonaparte, 447 St.-Francois Xavier, (514) 844-1448, fax (514) 844-0272, offers views of Montreal's historic heart from many of its 30 individually decorated rooms. On a quiet side street, the Bonaparte has an excellent restaurant of the same name. Doubles $98 to $132.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>It used to be said that, after language and politics, food was the favorite topic of conversation in Quebec. But now, judging by the expanding waistlines of the graying separatist leaders, food may be winning out .</p>
        <p>My introduction to the sensuous culinary delights of Montreal came last winter when a waitress at Toque instructed me to place a chunk of warm foie gras on my tongue and feel it dissolve around the sides. In an unpretentious setting on Montreal's restaurant row, Toque, 3842 Rue St.-Denis, (514) 499-2084, is near the top of the city's dining pyramid. Giving Quebecois products a new spin, the chef, Normand Laprise, serves maple-syrup-glazed quail as an appetizer, and roasted saddle of lamb with butternut squash and fiddlehead ferns among the main courses. Dinner for two, with wine, was $150. Reservations are essential.</p>
        <p>Within walking distance of the Sherbrooke Street hotels is an old favorite for a quiet romantic dinner by the fireplace, Chez la Mere Michel, 1209 Rue Guy, (514) 934-0473. As flute music warbled, we had lobster souffle Nantua and tournedos bearnaise. Dinner for two, with wine, was $142.</p>
        <p>In heavily French-speaking East Montreal, Laloux is an elegant restaurant popular with the business crowd at lunch. It is run by an expatriate French chef, Andre Besson, and is at 250 Avenue des Pins East, (514) 287-9127, on a quiet street far from the tourist flow. Laloux offers veal escalope with dried apricots, almonds, muscat wine sauce and linguini, or poached red snapper with white wine, a la mandarine, and crispy vegetables. Dinner for two, with wine, $68.</p>
        <p>An affordable place in the Old Port neighborhood is Stash's Cafe, 200 St.-Paul West, (514) 845-6611, a Polish restaurant with a Warsaw counterculture air. Ensconced behind thick stone walls with views of pedestrian traffic, Stash's offers four-course menus for $13 to $16.50. Specialities include zurek (a white borscht), wild boar, and strudel.</p>
        <p>Pino, 1471 Rue Crescent, (514) 289-1930, with a heavily Italian menu, is strategically perched on a second-floor corner, with tables placed by the curving windows for people-watching along Rue Ste.-Catherine. Calamari with garlic butter, a three-cheese green pasta and beers came to $36 for two.</p>
