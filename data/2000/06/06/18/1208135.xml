        <p>Each of us consumed 24 gallons of the stuff last year (down from 29 gallons in 1975), but milk's share of stomach -- industry-speak for beverage market share -- is only 12 percent, less than half that of carbonated soft drinks. We drink nearly as much beer and coffee as milk, and if current trends continue, we could soon be drinking more bottled water than milk too. So the question for the industry, according to Rachel Kaldor of the Dairy Institute of California, is ''How do you make milk cool?'' In the past few years, the answer has been marketing. Tap Britney Spears as the newest mustache model and sponsor her current tour. But now a new answer has arisen: make milk that tastes like something else.</p>
        <p>THE COLOR OF MILK  ''Flavored milks are going through the ceiling,'' says Jeff Manning, executive director of the California Milk Processor Board and one of the creators of the ''Got Milk'' campaign. New flavoring and pasteurization technologies enable dairies to create and distribute a wide array of flavors. Meadow Gold of Utah sells vanilla-orange milk and root beer milk. Safeway's Lucerne brand sells mocha-cappuccino-flavored milk. Shamrock Farms of Arizona offers Cookies 'n Cream. And Turkey Hill Dairies in Pennsylvania is considering caramel and black raspberry for the fall. Two flavors Turkey Hill tested but rejected: peanut butter and pina colada.</p>
        <p>CHOC-FULL OF . . . SUGAR  Since 1974, low-fat milk (1 percent and 2 percent) has just about doubled in popularity; the market for skim milk has grown even more than that. But chocolate milk (which is usually low-fat) is the fastest growing category of milk, period. Sales increased 16 percent for the first half of this year alone. The industry is pushing chocolate milk hard with ''Got Chocolate Milk?'' ads and waves of nutritional data to pacify moms. (Women buy more than 90 percent of milk.) Perhaps the biggest trend in this area is chocolate whole milk. A single pint of Crystal Cream and Butter's Double Dark Chocolate milk contains 440 calories and 18 grams of fat.</p>
        <p>SPILT MILK  The milk marketers haven't neglected packaging. Traditionally, 95 percent of all milk has been consumed at home, much of the rest at school. But as Donna Berry, an editor at Dairy Foods magazine notes, ''What kid wants to drink from that paperboard carton you were forced to in school?'' Thus the new single-serve, clear-plastic containers that fit into car cup holders and have resealable tops. ''The Chug,'' the plastic container from Dean Foods, was credited last year with increasing its chocolate milk sales by more than 150 percent. Milk is even being tested in vending machines.</p>
        <p>SPOILT MILK  Not everyone thinks more milk is a wholesome thing. In March, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ran ads encouraging college students to drink beer rather than milk, for the sake of the cows. And at last month's National Nutrition Summit in Washington, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a vegetarian group, argued that dairy products are unhealthy. In fact, 30 to 50 million Americans are lactose intolerant. Good thing, then, that the $300 million business of providing milk alternatives, limited for decades to soy or rice milk, is following the lead of the far larger milk industry. Blue Diamond Growers is offering Almond Breeze, a milk alternative, in chocolate and vanilla, as well as the original almond.</p>
