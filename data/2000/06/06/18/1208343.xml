        <p>''My hair has become my signature,'' said Andre Royo, an actor, who describes his head of matted tufts as ''in between the Afro and the dreads.'' But his trademark is not singular. Lenny Kravitz and Marcy Grey, both singers, as well as Method Man, the rap performer, have started sporting the same kinky look. Mr. Royo, who had favored his hair short, with a square cut in the back, thinks the hairdo makes him appear ''menacing and cool.'' That may be why he was cast as a villain in John Singleton's version of ''Shaft,'' which opened on Friday.</p>
        <p>Another appeal is that unlike previous looks for black men, including the Afro, dreadlocks and the shaven scalp, all of which required upkeep, Mr. Royo's hair is virtually maintenance-free. ''I just pull out the back where I slept on it and go,'' he said.</p>

        <p>''My hair has become my signature,'' said Andre Royo, an actor, who describes his head of matted tufts as ''in between the Afro and the dreads.'' But his trademark is not singular. Lenny Kravitz and Marcy Grey, both singers, as well as Method Man, the rap performer, have started sporting the same kinky look. Mr. Royo, who had favored his hair short, with a square cut in the back, thinks the hairdo makes him appear ''menacing and cool.'' That may be why he was cast as a villain in John Singleton's version of ''Shaft,'' which opened on Friday.</p>
        <p>Another appeal is that unlike previous looks for black men, including the Afro, dreadlocks and the shaven scalp, all of which required upkeep, Mr. Royo's hair is virtually maintenance-free. ''I just pull out the back where I slept on it and go,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To offset the carefree coif, Mr. Royo is wearing a classic suit by D&amp;G ($800 to $850 at Dolce &amp; Gabbana, 434 West Broadway, near Prince Street), patent leather loafers by Miu Miu ($270 at Tootsi Plohound, 38 West 57th Street) and tinted aviator glasses ($24, Screaming Mimi's, 382 Lafayette Street, near Fourth Street), the current must-have retro accessory, which he wears indoors and out. ''I saw my father in glasses like this back in the days,'' he said. ''I always wanted to be the man that he was. When I was growing up, it was strictly jeans and Nikes, and Pops was in slacks. So now when I wear a suit, some of him rubs off on me. He taught me style.'' The fly-daddy image is completed by his daughter, Stella, 2, who appeared in a recent Baby Gap ad campaign and who accompanies Mr. Royo on many of his auditions for good luck.</p>
