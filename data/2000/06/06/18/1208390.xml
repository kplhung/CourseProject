        <p>LESLIE WIESENFELDER and his wife, Phyllis, are not what you would call big donors to political campaigns -- certainly not the kind of fat cats singled out by reformers for contributing to a debasement of the democratic process.</p>
        <p>But this Maryland pair, who joke about canceling each other's votes, are a political odd couple that still typify a growing phenomenon: families that give money to opposing sides. Though the Wiesenfelders appear to manage it harmoniously, such cross-giving in other households sometimes jeopardizes domestic tranquillity.</p>
        <p>''She's far more liberal than I am,'' said Mr. Wiesenfelder, a lawyer and registered Republican who, according to the Federal Election Commission, sent $286 last year to Senator John McCain, the former presidential candidate. Mrs. Wiesenfelder, a Democrat, is listed as a $500 donor to another former contender, Bill Bradley.</p>
        <p>The Wiesenfelders, who live just outside Washington in Chevy Chase, even write checks for their dueling contributions from a joint account. ''It's not a consultation and it's not a tradeoff,'' Mr. Wiesenfelder said of their less-than-fully-collegial method. But it's also ''not personal, not an affront'' to the other, he added.</p>
        <p>Some politically opposed couples find contributions a somewhat greater threat to harmony. ''There's a higher risk you run when money is involved,'' said John Buckley, a former top official in Republican presidential campaigns and now a senior vice president at Fannie Mae, the federally chartered home-financing corporation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buckley, who is married to Anna Bennett, a consultant to Democratic candidates, said he recently contributed from their joint account to George W. Bush and received in return a mail solicitation for more money -- addressed to both him and his wife. On an earlier occasion, he had to move quickly to intercept a letter thanking both for a contribution he made to Senator Christopher S. Bond, the Missouri Republican.</p>
        <p>''It could have been quite embarrassing if it had gotten noticed'' by his wife or, perhaps worse, by her clients, Mr. Buckley said. ''I think it's probably time for separate accounts, given the fact that many of the people she most supports are running against those I'm most supportive of.''</p>
        <p>Combing through the 1999 records of the Federal Election Commission, the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington found scores of politically contrary contributions; the number may be rising with economic prosperity, which affords more people the resources to indulge political passions.</p>
        <p>And while political giving was long dominated by men, ''there's absolutely more women giving now,'' especially at the presidential level, said Clyde Wilcox, a government professor at Georgetown University.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the best-known unmatched pair is James Carville, a chief troubleshooter for President Clinton, and Mary Matalin, a top campaign aide for former President George Bush who now appears on CNN's ''Crossfire'' and advises George W. Bush's presidential campaign. Then there is Ronald O. Perelman, the billionaire businessman who splashes money around to an assortment of mendicant parties and politicians, and Patricia Duff, a major fund-raiser for Democrats. The pair had a loud confrontation at the Democrats' 1996 convention in Chicago, just before the breakup of their stormy marriage of less than two years.</p>
        <p>To be sure, politically mixed marriages remain a distinct minority. ''Most folks marry people who share their values, including their partisanship,'' said Paul S. Herrnson, a political scientist at the University of Maryland and author of a book on Congressional elections. ''And in cases where they disagree, they probably don't have much animosity about it.''</p>
        <p>Charlotte Kramer of Shaker Heights, Ohio, for example, gave $1,000 to Senator McCain, while Vice President Al Gore got $1,000 from her husband, Leonard S. Schwartz. ''His leanings are more Democratic,'' said Ms. Kramer, who administers a charitable foundation. ''I'm sort of a Ripon Republican,'' referring to the centrist organization. Even so, the ''discussion'' rarely escalates into argument, she said.</p>
        <p>Rudi Lee, an Atlanta homemaker and periodic contributor to Republican candidates, is more than a little discreet about it with her husband, Michael, a paper-company manager. He is also a Republican, but they disagree on various issues, including abortion and whether there is a glass ceiling for female executives. But the subject of donations ''just doesn't come up,'' said Mrs. Lee, who draws such checks on her account. ''He probably doesn't even know.''</p>
        <p>In households where parents are politically engaged, there is a good chance the children are, too. The 1999 records of the Federal Elections Commission include one extended family in Missouri whose members gave to the campaigns of Senator John Ashcroft, a Republican seeking re-election, and his Democratic opponent, Gov. Mel Carnahan, in the most expensive Senate race outside New York. The records show that 16 people with the same family name and small-town address made donations -- more than two dozen to the Ashcroft campaign and more than one dozen to Mr. Carnahan's.</p>
        <p>Analysts say cross-purpose donations within families appear especially common in primaries, when disagreement often centers on which candidate is most electable, rather than on fundamental principles.</p>
        <p>And in some cases donations are spread among opposing candidates or parties for business, not personal, reasons. According to the records, Stephen K. Lambright, general counsel for the Anheuser-Busch Companies, gave $1,000 to George W. Bush, $1,000 to Al Gore and $2,000 to the Democratic Leaders' Victory Fund 2000 last year, while his wife, Gail, gave $1,000 each to Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore. ''You could look at any given election and probably find us both on both sides,'' Mr. Lambright said.</p>
        <p>Sometimes campaigns ask a donor to let it reallocate, say, a $500 donation, assigning half to the original donor and half to the spouse so that more of the total qualifies for matching funds; the federal government matches the first $250 an individual gives to a presidential primary candidate. The strategy sometimes extends to children.</p>
        <p>BUT ideology remains a prime motivator in generating campaign cash. Consider Bruce J. Teitelbaum and his wife, Suri Kasirer. He is a former campaign manager for Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican mayor of New York; she is a prominent Democratic consultant and activist and a delegate to the party's national convention in Los Angeles this August.</p>
        <p>''My wife is a loyal Democrat, right to the core,'' Mr. Teitelbaum said. ''Our house is flooded with solicitations, and she never fails to contribute. Sometimes I ask her why in the world she gives to people she doesn't know.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kasirer, who acknowledges that her husband is not ''as ideological as I am,'' bristles when he wonders out loud whether she ought to discuss contributions with him -- the couple make their donations from separate accounts. ''We each do our own political giving,'' she said, her voice suggesting that their marriage benefits from the fact that travel and work commitments often separate them.</p>
        <p>''We're not together enough to argue about it,'' Mr. Teitelbaum said with a smile.</p>
