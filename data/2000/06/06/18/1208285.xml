        <p>SAY what you will about Ricky Martin -- he remains one of the most exciting live performers on tour.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin, the former child star, is suffering a bad case of overexposure. Can you even count how many times you have heard ''Livin' La Vida Loca?'' Or how many times you have caught yourself singing it?</p>
        <p>But backlash is part of the price of fame. Fans and press build celebrities up and then knock them down. Once a song becomes so imbedded in pop culture, as Mr. Martin's 1999 hit ''Vida Loca'' was, it is hard to live down. As with ''Melrose Place'' in its early years, everyone loved to watch it, but no one would admit it.</p>
        <p>Although the 28-year-old Latin sex symbol has been making music since he was a boy, it was really the 1998 Grammy Awards broadcast that made him a superstar. In an evening dominated by artists like Lauryn Hill, Madonna and Celine Dion, Mr. Martin came out, bumping, grinding and swiveling his Elvis-like hips. Backed by a splash of colorful streamers, acrobats, gymnasts, dancers and singers, he performed a carnivale-like ''La Copa de la Vida,'' and in that one moment brought Latin music to the forefront.</p>
        <p>Over a billion viewers in 187 countries watched the electrifying performance and later that evening witnessed Mr. Martin win the Best Latin Pop Performance award for his album ''Vuelve.'' It was not long before he opened the door for many other Latin artists, from virtual unknowns to those who had paid their dues on the large international Spanish-speaking market. They began selling millions of records. Enrique Iglesias, Julio Iglesias Jr., Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez and others began to benefit from Ricky Martin's explosive breakout.</p>
        <p>There was only one way to top that Grammy moment (which lives in musical television history along with Michael Jackson's Emmy-winning 1983 moonwalk on the ''Motown 25'' special) and that was to find the perfect single. And Mr. Martin did that with Desmond Child's ''Livin' La Vida Loca,'' the consummate match of Latin salsa and American pop. All Mr. Martin, who was born Enrique Jose Martin Morales IV, had to do was show up.</p>
        <p>But he did much more than that. He proved that he was more than just a pretty boy who could shake his rear on stage. He could sing, he could dance and he had a good sense of theatrics. And yes, he also happened to be good looking.</p>
        <p>Raised in San Juan, P.R., Mr. Martin began his musical career at age 6. By 1984, when he was 12, he joined the teenage group Menudo. He left the group in 1989 to finish high school, and eventually released three solo albums, which reached gold status (sales of 500,000).</p>
        <p>He grew up listening to rock 'n' roll like Boston, Cheap Trick and David Bowie, but his mother soon intervened, fed up with his musical tastes. She brought him to a Celia Cruz concert and the Queen of Salsa changed the course of his life.</p>
        <p>Besides music, Mr. Martin began an acting career, which led to success in Mexico (he won their equivalent of an Academy award) and two major successful roles in America -- Miguel on ''General Hospital'' and Marius in ''Les Miserables'' on Broadway.</p>
        <p>But it was the music world that he hoped to conquer, and his plan was simple -- mix a Latin beat with a pop song, throw in a little Chippendales attitude and record in English. And it paid off after the Grammy performance and subsequent release of his English-language eponymous debut.</p>
        <p>For those who caught the first leg of this tour, last year, the upcoming show at the Continental Airlines Arena, won't be that different. Why fix it, if it isn't broken? From the bass-heavy, pulsating ''Vida Loca'' sung from a fender-battered Mustang to the slow-burn croon on a couch, center stage, purring ''She's All I Ever Had,'' Mr. Martin pulls out all the stops.</p>
        <p>He starts the show with the familiar ''Vida Loca'' intro and he soon appears atop the vintage Mustang convertible that rises out of the center of his steel-and-chrome stage to sound of horn-led percussion. He is ably backed by a first-rate 12-piece band and eight limber dancers, some hanging from poles. There are flashing pink and blue neon lights, conveyer belts and a large video backdrop. It takes 23 semi trucks to transport Mr. Martin's high-tech show from city to city.</p>
        <p>Many of his ballads like ''Private Emotion'' and ''I Am Made of You,'' are showcased, slowing down the pace when more raucous roof-raisers like the funky horn-crazy ''Shake Your Bon-bon'' and ''Cup of Life'' would have set the place on fire.</p>
        <p>Fans, however, would most likely have no criticism, while neophytes might be simply dazzled by the high energy and spectacular theatrics, both physical and technical. Mr. Martin is far from a one-hit-wonder, and the best place for him to prove that is on stage.</p>
        <p>RICKY MARTIN  Continental Airlines Arena, 50 Route 120, East Rutherford.  Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.  (201) 935-3900.</p>
