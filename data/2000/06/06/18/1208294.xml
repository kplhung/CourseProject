        <p>Re ''There's More Than One Way to Become a Mom'' (May 14):</p>
        <p>I was delighted to see Regina Barreca move us from the personal to the political, so well camouflaged under the guise of humor, as she pointed out that ''mothering'' is no longer restricted to those who give birth. It then follows that the values of mothering can then be taught and learned by both men and women. This is probably only one of Ms. Barreca's many achievements with her students.</p>

        <p>Hooray for Ms. Barreca for guiding us further along toward an ethic of caring, an investment of genuine concern for the other person. What an enormously powerful way to make a difference in the world.</p>
