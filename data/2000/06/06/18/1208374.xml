        <p>THE big question that dominated the annual awards dinner of the Council of Fashion Designers of America on Thursday night at Lincoln Center was not who would win -- would Oscar prevail over Helmut, thus winning one for Park Avenue, Swifty's and taupe double-faced suits? -- but whether everyone would be home by 11 p.m.</p>
        <p>''Do you know when it's going to be over?'' Carolina Herrera kept asking people. ''Have you heard?''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Herrera, dressed in a melange of cream couture silks, was sitting next to Oscar's wife, Annette de la Renta, who had on a long black dress with a diamond pin clasped to her shoulder. From where they sat, in one of the conversation pits reserved for big spenders under one of the two large tents set up for cocktails and a buffet supper, they could see just about everyone. Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue, was there in a white slip dress with her date, Shelby Bryan, who was talking to Vera Wang's husband, Arthur Becker, when Ms. Wang said: ''I have to be honest -- it was Kenneth Cole's and my idea not to have another sit-down dinner. We thought the faster the better.''</p>
        <p>This sense of urgency was understandable. The council's awards dinner last year was possibly one of the longest, dullest, most overwrought evenings in the history of New York: six and a half hours of snafus, ballyhoo and inflated egos, all joyfully recounted in the newspapers. Not wishing to take another tomahawk between the eyes, Stan Herman and Fern Mallis, the council's principal organizers and drumbeaters, evidently agreed that faster was indeed better and saw to it that the night ended, shock, by 10:15.</p>
        <p>Although most people seemed relieved that the initial part of the evening took place under open-sided tents next to Avery Fisher Hall, and a few even remarked that the dusk and adjacent reflecting pool made them think they were in Los Angeles, there was nonetheless a sense that the evening, despite its supposed glamour, had all the zing of another trade event.</p>
        <p>''Save me, baby, save me,'' a well-connected publicist called out, as if clinging to a life raft, in the middle of a sea of all-too-familiar faces and people whose phone calls she wouldn't have returned, but who were now advancing toward her with a hopeful glint in their eye. ''Darling!''</p>
        <p>In another part of the tent, Richard Lambertson, who, with his partner, John Truex, would win the top accessories award, was sanguine about the fashion industry's chronic refusal to be impressed by what, to the onlookers who had gathered near the reflecting pool, would probably have seemed fabulous.</p>
        <p>''I mean, what industry is more critical than fashion?'' he said. ''You're always thinking the clothes are bad, the food is bad, the flowers are bad.'' Mr. Lambertson shrugged.</p>
        <p>By 8 p.m. -- an hour and fifteen minutes before the awards show started inside Avery Fisher -- both tents were jammed. Two of the blond Miller sisters, Pia Getty and Alexandra Von Furstenberg, streamed past in the sort of slinky, glimmery dresses worn by women in Hollywood who turn letters on game shows. But they looked sexy, which seemed to be the idea. There was talk about who had read and not read the new Jacques Barzun book, ''From Dawn to Decadence,'' summing up 500 years of civilization.</p>
        <p>Then everyone trooped into the concert hall. Sandra Bernhard was the host, and she did a brilliant job being snarky.</p>
        <p>''I don't want you to be nervous about me being here tonight,'' she said from under a fedora. ''We're not here to judge tonight'' -- that got a big laugh -- ''everyone's a winner.'' Later, Ms. Bernhard came out in a red-beaded dress with kimono sleeves, followed by a denim-blue sheath with a jean jacket studded with a Star of David. ''I hate you,'' she said at one point. ''I love you.  Hold me.''</p>
        <p>Later, acknowledging the presence of Valentino, who had brought an entourage from Rome to accept the lifetime achievement award, Ms. Bernhard said coyly, ''I've been one of Val's gals for many years.''</p>
        <p>Among the winners were Helmut Lang and John Varvatos in the men's wear categories, Miguel Adrover as best new designer of women's wear, Jean Paul Gaultier for international design and Issey Miyake for his Pleats Please dot-com site. Ellen Barkin accepted a glamour award on behalf of ''the Hollywood community,'' which seemed a lot of behalves to accept on, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. presented a humanitarian award to Liz Claiborne for her environmental work.</p>
        <p>Peter Som, a young designer, accepted a special award for the retired Bill Blass, who has been ailing but who, had he been there, no doubt would have had something deliciously tart to say about the evening, which, at that point, seemed more suffused with urgency than meaning or drama.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the fashion designers' council may have overcompensated a bit after last year's windy program. Each award was presented so quickly, against a backdrop of whirling images, that the moment seemed to vaporize instantly -- and then on to the next. One felt for Valentino, whose 40 years of achievement flashed by in a few minutes and who was then heckled by three fur protesters lodged in the tiers just as he began to speak.</p>
        <p>In the end, it was Mr. de la Renta who received the top women's wear award, winning over Donna Karan and Mr. Lang, who was a no-show, even though he was a nominee in three categories. Mr. Lang, who moved to New York from Vienna a couple of years ago, has a tendency to do things his own way, but in this case his decision to stay away seemed pretentious. And when Ingrid Sischy, a friend and the editor in chief of Interview, went up to accept his men's wear award and remarked that the designer had ''changed the rules in American fashion,'' there were definitely some raised eyebrows and murmurs of dissent from the rows.</p>
        <p>''Changed American fashion?''  Mr. de la Renta said.</p>
