        <p>Arlette Philippous Brauer, 83, and George Emil Bria, 84, were married yesterday in Newton, Mass., at the home of the bride's daughter, Janet Brauer Weinberger, and son-in-law, Dr. Steven Weinberger. Ruth H. Van Doren, a college classmate of the bride who was appointed a Massachusetts civil marriage celebrant for the day, officiated.</p>
        <p>The bride retired as a writer and editor for MD, a magazine for doctors in New York, and until two years ago was a contributing editor for World Priorities, an organization in Washington that produced scholarly publications. She graduated magna cum laude from Smith College.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom retired from The Associated Press in New York, where he was an editor and a correspondent, and for which he now writes a gardening column. He spent most of World War II in Rome, and vividly remembers covering the German withdrawal from Italy and the scene after the death of Mussolini. He graduated from Amherst College and received a master's degree in Italian language and literature from Middlebury College.</p>
        <p>The couple's relationship goes back to 1938 and college days. They have interests and personal history in common -- both had convent-school educations, are avid gardeners and this month, each won a United States Tennis Association trophy at a seniors tournament in Albany. But what first brought them into the same circle was that Mrs. Brauer's best friend, the former Mary Ormsbee Whitton, became Mr. Bria's wife.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Brauer married Dr. Paul H. Brauer, a psychiatrist, and through the years, the Brauer and Bria families remained close. They socialized so frequently that their children came to call their parents' friends Aunt and Uncle. Mrs. Brauer called Mr. Bria for help with articles she was working on; he advised her on the types of plants she should try growing at her beach house in Westport, Conn. Indeed, after Mr. Bria's wife died in 1998, Mrs. Brauer recalls, she made efforts to introduce him to other women.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bria was not interested. Then, last December, Mrs. Brauer's husband died.</p>
        <p>''I always liked her, from the first time I met her,'' Mr. Bria said. ''She was always in the back of my mind, and when we were free, I courted her.'' He added, ''We're just right for each other, if you want to know.''</p>
        <p>They conversed by e-mail; he was living in Pound Ridge, N.Y., and she was in Manhattan. Soon enough, they decided to marry without a formal engagement. ''We both felt we had very little time to lose,'' Mrs. Brauer said.</p>
        <p>Both said that they thought their previous spouses would approve and that their children had supported their decision to marry.</p>
        <p>The bride's daughter, Mrs. Weinberger, a lawyer who does marital mediation in Newton, says she has been telling the story of her mother's new romance not just because it involves her mother, but because of the hope that it offers to others. ''It's very life-affirming for everyone to hear about what can happen, even when you're 83 or 84,'' she said.</p>
