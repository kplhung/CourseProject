        <p>John Bruno, 92, has worked in the composing room of The Staten Island Advance for 76 years. Ask about his days as a teenage printer's devil when the end of a 12-hour shift found his arms tarred with viscous ink, about press operators and journeymen he has worked with, about anything connected to the only full-time job he has ever had, and his eyes mist over.</p>
        <p>''S. I. Newhouse was like a father to me,'' he said of his first boss, the man who began the Newhouse chain by buying The Advance in 1922. When Mr. Newhouse died in 1979, he had set up his business, which now includes Conde Nast magazines and cable television stations, with relatives in key positions.</p>
        <p>So where did that leave Mr. Bruno, a self-described ''nobody'' who crossed social lines and somehow befriended a mogul-in-the-making? With a lot of job security.</p>
        <p>''Without question, John Bruno has the longest tenure of anyone in the Newhouse chain,'' said Richard E. Diamond, who has been publisher of The Advance since the death of his uncle, Mr. Newhouse. ''He probably has the longest tenure of anyone in America.''</p>
        <p>This suggests that two traits are needed to endure in a job that has changed, in Mr. Bruno's time, from the Ben Franklin-era technology of lead type set by hand to today's laser printers.</p>
        <p>One is loyalty. By his own account, Mr. Bruno rises every morning at 3:30 to say a rosary before arriving at his desk at 6:30 a.m. (Since 1924, the year Calvin Coolidge was elected president, he has seldom missed a day of work, and has amassed 12 years of unused vacation time.) After his shift, he attends noon Mass, where he often prays for his fellow workers. Ask Mr. Bruno about those workers, especially those with whom he set hot type in the predawn hours before automation came in, and he tears up again. ''Oh, they were great men,'' he says.</p>
        <p>And there is the second trait. He admits that when he supervised the workers he now prays for, he drove them hard.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bruno became the boss of the composing room in 1958, he outlawed swearing and drinking, and the entire staff worked to the end of their shifts, even if the paper had been put to bed. As deadline approached, he dragged employees from the men's room if he thought they were malingering. It was the kind of behavior that is laughed off as irascible only in hindsight.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Bruno no longer works as a foreman or pulls long shifts, he still pastes up ads between cat naps at his desk. And he still wears his blue-and-white striped apron, a steel knife poking from its frayed front pocket.</p>
        <p>Ask him to recall a life at work, and he looks at his hands: they are bulbous mitts.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't a smart boy,'' he said, beginning with the memory of his teenage self, green to the newspaper business. He is crying again but steadies himself, placing a hand on his desk. It is an old wooden thing with rounded brass corners inherited more than two decades ago from S. I. Newhouse himself.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't a smart boy,'' he repeats. ''But I made a good friend.''</p>
