        <p>GOOD news, friends; this is your chance to redeem yourselves. That's right, it's time for another Big Cash Giveaway Extravaganza, in which we sprinkle money around the state and ask the people who find it to tell us what they did with it.</p>
        <p>Last year, you'll recall, your performance left something to be desired. In fact, it stank. We took 10 $5 bills and left them at various spots -- on windshields, in convenience stores, etc. -- along with notes and prepaid envelopes. The notes asked the people who found the money to come up with something nice/creative/interesting to do with it, and then to send us a letter telling us what it was.</p>

        <p>GOOD news, friends; this is your chance to redeem yourselves. That's right, it's time for another Big Cash Giveaway Extravaganza, in which we sprinkle money around the state and ask the people who find it to tell us what they did with it.</p>
        <p>Last year, you'll recall, your performance left something to be desired. In fact, it stank. We took 10 $5 bills and left them at various spots -- on windshields, in convenience stores, etc. -- along with notes and prepaid envelopes. The notes asked the people who found the money to come up with something nice/creative/interesting to do with it, and then to send us a letter telling us what it was.</p>
        <p>We received one very nice letter from someone who said that finding the fiver made him, or perhaps it was a her, reflect on his/her good fortune over the past year; that reflection prompted him/her to give the money to charity. From the other finders, we received a vast nothingness.</p>
        <p>We used this space to berate these nonparticipants, and New Jerseyans in general, for their staggering lack of gumption and imagination. Though, in fairness, it should be pointed out that weeks afterward, we received a second response, in one of those ''delivery of this letter has been delayed because we mangled it in our letter-processing machinery'' bags from the Postal Service. As near as we could tell from the surviving pieces, that finder had used the $5 to buy lottery tickets.</p>
        <p>Anyway, this year we are varying the theme somewhat. Instead of just leaving money in places where it can be easily found, we're going to hide it, and here give you clues as to where it is. The idea is that you'll read this column and rush to the spot. Then you'll send us a letter telling us what you did with the money. We will thus accumulate some fun and/or touching stories for a future column.</p>
        <p>Now for the particularly exciting part: because $5 apparently wasn't enough to inspire people, this year we are leaving 20's -- five of them in all. No, that's not a typo: we are giving away ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS! CASH!</p>
        <p>We realize that this pales somewhat in comparison with the radio station giveaways that clog the airwaves at this time of year. (''It's another Million-Buck Beach Weekend!'') Frankly, we wonder where radio stations are getting all this money; we suspect it has something to do with that payola thing we've read about. We also doubt that any of this radio money is real and that the people whose names are announced as having won it actually exist.</p>
        <p>So stick with the Jersey column, because a real $20 is better than a fake million any day. Now, the clues. Having watched people muff the easiest of questions on that Regis Philbin show, we know that brain power is in short supply these days, so we're going to make it easy on you:</p>
        <p>1. In Central Jersey there's a county whose name rhymes with ''Boris.'' There's a town there whose name rhymes with ''Boristown.'' In ''Boristown'' there's a green that was the site of Morris, I mean ''Boris'' County's first two courthouses. Look at the base of the lightpoles near the flag.</p>
        <p>2. Outside the train station in a large New Jersey city that isn't Trenton or Camden or Atlantic City, there's a newspaper box where you can help yourself to a free copy of The Twin Visions Weekly (''Positive news for a change''). So help yourself.</p>
        <p>3. One of Weehawken's most interesting features once held thousands of gallons of water. Now it just sits there taking up space, but alluringly so. Go admire it. Start by admiring those odd little holes near the side entrance to Pathmark.</p>
        <p>4. We'll be blunt: we put one of the twenties in Summit because we've read that that's where Jon Corzine, the Democratic Senate candidate, lives, and we figure he could use the money after spending such an absurd amount on the primaries. He, or anyone else, is invited to sit on that bench across from the United Methodist Church and ponder past misdeeds, eternity, whatever, and maybe feel around on the underside of the seat.</p>
        <p>5. Attention Caite, Janis, Tanya and the other eighth graders at West Windsor-Plainsboro Community Middle School whom I talked to on Career Day last week. I told you you should start reading a newspaper regularly. Did you? If so, maybe you'll be the first to stop by the Plainsboro Public Library and thumb through ''New Jersey Ferns and Fern-Allies,'' a lonely little book that hasn't been checked out since 1993.</p>
        <p>Scavengers, start your hunting. And try to produce some decent stories this time.</p>
