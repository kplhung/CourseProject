        <p>THURSDAY morning went O.K. for David Butler at the Long Island Capital Forum. Thursday afternoon, though, was fantastic.</p>
        <p>The difference was Alan Patricof, in particular the cautionary tone the legendary venture capitalist took in his keynote comments during lunch. Mr. Patricof, whose list of early-stage investments includes America Online and Home Depot, weighed in on the decline of dot-com fever.</p>
        <p>The Park Avenue financier didn't quite say the bubble has burst. But he did offer a verbal cold shower to Internet entrepreneurs looking for the kind of investment money they had been used to getting.</p>
        <p>''It's all going to be about bandwidth now,'' declared Mr. Patricof, whose investment portfolio is approximately $7 billion. ''It's going to be about delivery. It's going to be about fundamentals.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Butler's Edgewood-based company, North American Internet Systems, supplies buildings with broadband Internet access -- in other words, bandwidth, delivery and fundamentals. Right after lunch Mr. Butler strode to the podium to tout his company and deliver his pitch for $12 million in investment capital.</p>
        <p>''The timing really could not have been better,'' he said later with a smile. ''I have 14 people I'm getting back to next week to set up meetings.''</p>
        <p>Those contacts were made at the Long Island Capital Forum, an annual event where entrepreneurs meet people with money to finance their dreams. Last year, the forum made more than $50 million worth of connections. For the sixth annual event, held on June 8 in Melville, 22 entrepreneurs paid $400 apiece to make an eight-minute pitch.</p>
        <p>If keynote speakers at industry conferences are sometimes faulted for preaching to the choir, pap was not on the menu at the June 8 forum. Mr. Patricof assured his dot-com-studded audience that ''we will never see dot-com market valuations this high again. It's history.</p>
        <p>''Market valuations stopped representing the fundamentals,'' he continued, ''and we had companies that had no profits, and no prospects for profits, with these extraordinary valuations.''</p>
        <p>Jeffrey L. Bass, founder and chairman of the event, and a partner at the Garden City accounting firm of Margolin, Winer &amp; Evens, insisted that the dot-com financial train had not completely left the station. Most of the 22 exhibitors were dot-coms.</p>
        <p>''Whenever you look at a hot market segment, you see companies that are succeeding and companies that are not,'' Mr. Bass said. Declining market valuations ''really remind us of the importance of fundamentals, like getting good management into place. That's what investors increasingly want to see. And the companies we've selected to present today have that.''</p>
        <p>Certainly, investors expect entrepreneurs to be able to make a sound business case, something they haven't always done at the forum. In its first several years, ill-prepared entrepreneurs often rambled about obscure features and benefits, at times drowning their messages in technical jargon and amateurish presentations. This year, in contrast, presenters strode on and off the platform with desktop multimedia presentations and, in general, clockwork efficiency, thanks to vigilant forum officials.</p>
        <p>''I guess I talked too long, because they herded me from the stage,'' sighed Daniel Yarosh, a biochemist winding up a pitch for $15 million for his Freeport company, AGI Dermatics.</p>
        <p>The more professional presentations were no accident. The speakers had all had been offered presentation coaching by Mr. Bass and his colleagues on the board of the Long Island Venture Capital Group, which sponsors the event.</p>
        <p>''This year, they were clearly better prepared for raising money,'' said Herman Fialkov, the much-admired dean of Long Island venture capitalists, who was among those trolling the event. ''It was very professional.''</p>
        <p>Despite running over his time, Mr. Yarosh hoped that he would connect with a source of much-needed funding.</p>
        <p>''It's been so expensive getting a product approved'' by the Food and Drug Administration, said the biochemist, who founded AGI in 1985. ''We need bridge or mezzanine financing. If we make a single solid financial contact today, we'll consider this event successful. My concern coming in was that the venture capitalists would send their e-commerce analysts and not be prepared to assess'' other sectors, such as biotech.</p>
        <p>One dot-com fund-seeker, David Bensol, got to deliver his pitch before lunch, at least. On his first day as chief executive of Bethpage-based Zydical.com, Mr. Bensol took the podium and asked for $6.5 million to build up what he described as an ''Internet B2B health-care solutions portal'' -- in other words, a web site that brings together sellers and buyers of medical products and services.</p>
        <p>Afterward Mr. Bensol called the experience the ''most terrifying thing'' he had ever done. Avoiding the breathless predictions of geometrically expanding market and boundless revenues that accompanied earlier dot-com investment pitches, he instead played up business-to-business applications that are already integrated into today's economy. Mr. Bensol's message became the event's mantra: ''Investors want to see experienced, quality management, and we have that.''</p>
        <p>''We're not looking to burn through millions of dollars in advertising,'' he said, as thousands of dot-coms have done. ''We have a solid brick-and-mortar strategy that will earn investors money.''</p>
        <p>Pitching her dot-com business after lunch, Marlene Hahitti insisted that anyCloseout.com was not ''just another Web site.'' Positioning her Manhattan-based Internet company as a way for manufacturers to lower the often substantial losses associated with excess inventory, she touted her own industry experience and the presence of former New York City comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman on her board. Her Web site, she emphasized, ''currently has over $10 million worth of inventory.''</p>
        <p>Entrepreneurial fund-seekers were not alone experiencing stress. Financiers, for their part, said their roles were demanding as well, in part because they had to whittle entrepreneurial expectations down to size. ''They're aching for last year's overvaluations,'' said Martin Boorstein, a partner in Walden Capital in Manhattan, nodding appreciatively at Mr. Patricof's lunchtime remarks. ''They're still looking for the kind of multiples they got last year. But when they get any kind of funding, they'll be happy.''</p>
        <p>Manny Ratafia of Woodbridge, Conn., said that events such as the Long Island Capital Forum induced him to travel around the tri-state area in search of deals under a million dollars.</p>
        <p>''Many venture capitalists have had so much success raising money that they need to invest larger amounts'' to achieve desired payback, he said. They also need payback earlier than most start-ups are prepared to deliver. Consequently, many venture capitalists are turning away from the relatively small investments sought at events such as the Long Island Capital Forum. ''That creates opportunity for people like me,'' said Mr. Ratafia, who specializes in smaller deals.</p>
        <p>As the meeting began to wind down, an upbeat David Butler spotted Mr. Patricof ambling about the exhibition hall. He introduced himself and thanked the financier for his remarks on broadband technology.</p>
        <p>''I told him what we did, and he seemed amused,'' Mr. Butler said, ''but he didn't ask for a meeting. So it's up to us to give him a call.''</p>
