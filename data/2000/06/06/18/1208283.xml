        <p>BILLY TAYLOR, who was once the house pianist for one of the best known jazz clubs in the country, New York's Birdland, will bring his singular style of composition and playing to the Florham Park-Madison Campus of Fairleigh Dickinson University next weekend as the headliner for Atlantic Mutual Jazzfest 2000.</p>
        <p>Jazzfest, New Jersey's oldest jazz festival, held next Saturday and Sunday, will feature two full days of acoustic jazz entertainment, from Dixieland to swing to bebop, with Mr. Taylor performing in the main tent on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor has been on stage with most of the greats from the world of jazz, including Charlie Parker, whom he appeared with on his first night on stage at Birdland in 1949. He also has played with Billie Holiday, John Coltrane, Miles Davis and other jazz masters. Born in North Carolina and playing since he was 7, Mr. Taylor is a prolific writer of both songs and books. ''I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free'' became a standard in the 1960's civil rights protests and his composition ''Homage,'' written for an anniversary celebration of Madison, Wis., won him a Grammy Award.</p>
        <p>His long career has also earned him an Emmy Award, a Tiffany Award, an Association of Arts Presenters Award of Merit and the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Fellowship Award.</p>
        <p>An observer of the jazz genre as well as a musician and composer, Mr. Taylor wrote one of the first books about bebop piano in the late 1940's. His most recent book, ''The Billy Taylor Collection,'' published by Hal Leonard Inc. in 1999 is a collection of solo transcriptions of standards and original compositions.</p>
        <p>He will perform on Saturday night with Chip Jackson on bass and Winard Harper on drums. The 25-year-old Atlantic Mutual Jazzfest, which is sponsored by the New Jersey Jazz Society, will feature entertainment on two indoor stages and one outdoor stage, which will be under a tent where a dance floor will be set up. Music will start at 10:30 a.m. both days. Mr. Taylor's Trio will play at 5 p.m. Saturday.</p>
        <p>Also on the bill for Saturday is Johnny Varro, who made his reputation playing piano with Eddie Condon. He leads the Johnny Varro Quartet featuring Jon-Erik Kellso on trumpet, Michael Moore on bass and Jeff Brillinger on drums.</p>
        <p>Kenny Davern, who was inducted into the Jazz Hall of Fame in 1997 and is considered one of the best clarinetists playing today, will perform with his quartet.</p>
        <p>The pianist Gene DiNovi, who seldom plays outside his home country of Canada, also will appear. In addition to his playing, Mr. DiNovi is known for his songwriting, having written his first major song, ''Have a Heart,'' with Johnny Mercer. He is also the author of ''Tout Va Bien,'' written with Bill Comstock, which was featured on Maurice Chevalier's last television special. He and Mr. Taylor built their reputations playing on New York's 52nd Street, once known to the world as Swing Street.</p>
        <p>Vince Giordano's Nighthawks will take the stage on Saturday to recreate the sounds of the 1920's and 1930's great jazz bands.</p>
        <p>Lou Donaldson, who first gained fame as part of the Jazz Messengers, will appear leading his quarter in their unique brand of bebop.</p>
        <p>Dixieland jazz will be heard on Sunday played by the Beale Street Jazz Band with Joyce Cobb on vocals. Also to be heard will be the Junior Mance Trio, lead by Mr. Mance, who like Mr. Taylor, is a leading jazz educator as well as musician.</p>
        <p>The tenor saxophonist Houston Person and the singer Etta Jones will be among the guests on Sunday as will Derek Smith, who played for many years in the Tonight Show band after making his reputation with Benny Goodman.</p>
        <p>A regular at the jazzfest, Bucky Pizzarelli will return with bassist Jay Leonhart, both of whom frequently play in New Jersey clubs, as does the Tony Corbiscello Big Band, which will also perform on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Those attending can bring picnic lunches. Tickets can be obtained by calling (973) 543-2829 or can be purchased at the door for one or both days.</p>
