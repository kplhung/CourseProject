        <p>Scene at Jack &amp; Jill Youth Center in Yonkers, NY, described as summer camp season nears; semi-retired Sam Frumkies, whose Russian-Jewish immigrant father, Edward, founded drug-goods business in the Bronx in 1900, takes personal interest in all his clients and their children; photos (M)</p>

        <p>IT was probably a mistake to mention the socks that got lost in the laundry. Sam Frumkies, 78, immediately tried to push his mesh sock bag, designed to keep wayward socks from being waylaid in home and camp laundries, on a reporter visiting the Jack &amp; Jill Youth Center here to find out why it is still outfitting summer campers.</p>
        <p>The answer has a lot to do with Sam Frumkies. By his own admission, the semi-retired Mr. Frumkies, who now helps his son, Larry, run the business -- has seen everything that campers (and their parents) can want for those experiences in the backwoods.</p>

        <p>IT was probably a mistake to mention the socks that got lost in the laundry. Sam Frumkies, 78, immediately tried to push his mesh sock bag, designed to keep wayward socks from being waylaid in home and camp laundries, on a reporter visiting the Jack &amp; Jill Youth Center here to find out why it is still outfitting summer campers.</p>
        <p>The answer has a lot to do with Sam Frumkies. By his own admission, the semi-retired Mr. Frumkies, who now helps his son, Larry, run the business -- has seen everything that campers (and their parents) can want for those experiences in the backwoods.</p>
        <p>With a retailing style that is a cross between an old-fashioned family doctor and a no-nonsense general launching an assault, Mr. Frumkies's highly personalized hand-holding technique keeps customers coming back.</p>
        <p>''I've taken care of multi-generations, and I remember my customers by name,'' Mr. Frumkies, a Yonkers native, said. ''A customer came in here the other day, and I remembered her from 20 years ago in the Bronx. I even remembered the camp she had gone to.''</p>
        <p>For Marcia Schultz of Rye Brook, shopping for her children's camp clothes here is a cherished routine. Her husband had been outfitted by Jack &amp; Jill when he was a camper, and his mother took him for their annual camp clothes shopping experience. For nearly a decade, Mrs. Schultz has taken her two children to Jack &amp; Jill for the same ritual. Like many of the store's longtime customers, Mrs. Schultz is a former camper, and her daughter attends the same Maine camp that she did.</p>
        <p>''It's a two-hour deal to shop here,'' Mrs. Schultz, who makes her appointment in February to go to the store, said with obvious affection for Sam Frumkies. ''Even if you're here to buy three pairs of socks, if you're particularly close with Sam, you're still there for two hours. Sam is your friend. Not only does he remember you, but he knows my niece and nephew who shop here, and when my husband came in, we were in the store for four hours.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''What's special is that Sam really cares about the child, and about having you buy clothes that will last more than one season. He doesn't want to rip you off. He makes you try on every pair of underwear, every pair of socks, every bathing suit, and if he doesn't think it's right, he'll say, 'Nope, next size'.''</p>
        <p>The Frumkies family, Russian-Jewish immigrants, founded a drygoods business in 1900, and the children's clothing business was started in 1937. Mr. Frumkies' father, Edward, was one of nine children, all of whom, with one exception, went into the clothing business.</p>
        <p>''Jack &amp; Jill was our branch,''  Mr. Frumkies said. ''We were the only one that specialized in children's wear.''</p>
        <p>From the first site on Jerome Avenue in the Bronx to its present Yonkers site, the store has seen competitors come and go. Jack &amp; Jill is one of the last -- Morris Brothers in Manhattan is another -- that caters to campers.</p>
        <p>''Most in the business fell by the wayside,'' Sam Frumkies said. ''Back then, Macy's had two floors devoted to a camp department. B. Altman's and Ohrbach's had camp departments.'' Even local stores like Epstein's in Tuckahoe or Squires in Chappaqua, don't quite make the grade in Mr. Frumkies's eyes. He said, ''They have day clothes, but not official camp clothes.''</p>
        <p>And camp clothes driven by the infamous list that can make grown-ups weep, what with the recommended 14 pairs of socks and underwear, 6 shorts and swimsuits and 8 T-shirts, can easily average $500 a child.</p>
        <p>Like a bridal salon, Jack &amp; Jill outfits customers by appointment whenever possible during peak shopping season, which runs from shortly after Christmas through April. Mid-May is the last date for ordering camp clothes that carry the camp's logo.</p>
        <p>Still, the store has enough basic pajamas, sweat shirts, sweat pants, bathing suits, socks and shorts to handle several bunks' worth of last-minute shoppers.</p>
        <p>In fact, nearly every square inch of the compact store is crammed from floor to ceiling with merchandise, with boxes and hangers reaching as far as the eye can see. Deliberately old-fashioned, the store still has the original counter top from the first store, a touchstone of sorts for longtime customers who retrieve their own childhood memories of camp shopping when leaning on it.</p>
        <p>And along the back wall, the family has decorated the blank space with badges and memorabilia from defunct camps, whose names trigger recollections for the parents of today's campers: Wayne, Camp Seneca, Camp Samoset, Camp Northwood.</p>
        <p>Jack &amp; Jill has survived, Sam Frumkies  suggested, because of the family's devotion to personal service.</p>
        <p>''In 1938, I was watching my mother and my aunt sewing name tapes for my brother and cousin,'' Mr. Frumkies said. ''I told my father, who didn't believe in advertising, that I'd send a postcard to selected people in Westchester saying that we'd sew free name tapes for orders of $7.50. Within 10 days, people started calling us up and coming down.''</p>
        <p>Although he declined to name current celebrity customers, he admitted that in the store's earlier, Bronx incarnation, Jack &amp; Jill outfitted members of the Roosevelt family as well as Ralph Lauren's parents, Rob Reiner and Dustin Hoffman's family. Mr. Frumkies recalled how customers had mobbed their store when Jackie Robinson stopped by, and how the police had to keep  the crowds away.</p>
        <p>And customers continue to come from Manhattan, Westchester and beyond.</p>
        <p>''I love this business,'' Mr. Frumkies said. ''This is my golf game. In the corporate world, you can't get humility. You only get humility doing business with customers.''</p>
        <p>Filling Goodie Boxes</p>
        <p>So you think you're finished with camp shopping for the season, now that the trunks have been packed. Think again.</p>
        <p>Most campers expect (and most camps tolerate, if not exactly encourage) packages from home. Usually filled with items like stationery, stickers, small stuffed animals, games and arts and crafts kits, such shipments are another part of the summer camp experience.</p>
