        <p>You need to show some consideration</p>
        <p>When the mailman delivers mail to your destination</p>
        <p>In his eyes, there's fear and hesitation</p>
        <p>Whenever he delivers to a certain location</p>
        <p>There's paranoia and terror on his face,</p>
        <p>He's got the mail in one hand and the other holding Mace.</p>
        <p>Yeah, come on everyone (sound of dogs barking madly), stop the dog bites!</p>
        <p>You don't want to be held responsible</p>
        <p>'cause the carrier Fluffy bit is in the hospital</p>
        <p>(Woman's distraught voice: ''No! Not my Fluffy!'')</p>
        <p>This rap song, written and recorded by two Postal Service employees and part of an agency videotape, has been part of a campaign to reduce the number of dog bites afflicting letter carriers in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The campaign was inspired by the 22 such incidents that took place in the borough in 1998, placing it fifth-highest among the areas the service had studied. The Brooklyn public schools have held a poster contest on dog bite safety as part of the campaign, and the borough's letter carriers have taken training sessions in which superintendents accompanied them on their routes to identify problem spots.</p>
        <p>Last week, in conjunction with National Dog Bite Awareness Month, the Postal Service announced the results. Brooklyn mail carriers were bitten only 14 times in 1999, and the borough has fallen to No. 17 on the list.</p>
        <p>''This is an age-old problem,'' said Joseph Lubrano, the Brooklyn postmaster. He said children were frequent victims of dog bites, and the Postal Service hoped they would be a conduit to  parents of the safety lessons they had learned.</p>
        <p>Bruno Papalia, a Brooklyn letter carrier who has been attacked by dogs several times in recent years, said he had seen a change since the education campaign began. ''People seem a little bit more aware,'' he said. ''They leave their doors closed more.'' Although dog bites tend to occur more in warm weather, he added, ''I don't think we've had a bite yet this summer.''</p>
        <p>The other borough with a high incidence of bitten mail carriers is Queens, which last year had a total of 16 in Jamaica and Flushing alone. (The service did not tally Queens as a whole.) The Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island had 6, 4 and 4, respectively.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lubrano said the Manhattan and Bronx  totals were lower because they had ''a heck of a lot of large apartment buildings and more centralized delivery,'' while Brooklyn and Queens had more detached houses with yards. Brooklyn is the only borough in which all 2,000 carriers deliver mail on foot, he said.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Jerica Rubin, 8, of Public School 90, and Nathaniel Steward, 10, of P.S. 244, got prizes and handshakes from Representative Anthony Wener, Democrat of Brooklyn, for their winning posters. The designs will be displayed in borough post offices.</p>
