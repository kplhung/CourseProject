        <p>AFTER attending the Puerto Rican Day parade in Manhattan last Sunday, 20-year-old Eric Rivera and four of his friends arrived at the Hempstead station of the Long Island Rail Road and began walking to his home in Uniondale. The group was carrying flags they obtained at the parade.</p>
        <p>According to police reports, as Mr. Rivera approached Front Street and Lenox Road in Uniondale, several cars pulled alongside the group. Words were exchanged. The occupants of the car got out, armed with bats, and gave chase. Mr. Rivera's friends were able to escape, but he was caught and beaten so badly that he died the next morning.</p>

        <p>AFTER attending the Puerto Rican Day parade in Manhattan last Sunday, 20-year-old Eric Rivera and four of his friends arrived at the Hempstead station of the Long Island Rail Road and began walking to his home in Uniondale. The group was carrying flags they obtained at the parade.</p>
        <p>According to police reports, as Mr. Rivera approached Front Street and Lenox Road in Uniondale, several cars pulled alongside the group. Words were exchanged. The occupants of the car got out, armed with bats, and gave chase. Mr. Rivera's friends were able to escape, but he was caught and beaten so badly that he died the next morning.</p>
        <p>Nassau County police investigators say they suspect the brutal killing was gang-related.</p>
        <p>Officer Michael Maloney of the police department's first precinct, which is headquartered in Baldwin, described the incident as the most violent in a resurgence of gang tensions in the Uniondale area, where the Salvadoran gang called Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, has been trying to move into territory considered to be the turf of a rival gang with a large Puerto Rican membership, the Latin Kings. Graffiti is often used by gangs to mark a specific territory, and this month MS-13 graffiti has begun showing up in Uniondale, Officer Maloney said.</p>
        <p>''It seems as if MS-13 is flexing their muscle in the area,'' he said. ''Something is going on.''</p>
        <p>Officer Maloney said that the killing of Mr. Rivera ''could be a signal from MS-13 that you are walking in an area that we claimed, and you will be beaten on sight. Or the victim could have been a target.''</p>
        <p>The police said they had no conclusive evidence that Mr. Rivera was a member of a gang. But Lt. Frank Guidice, commander of the county police department's homicide squad, said that Mr. Rivera had a previous arrest on robbery and weapons possession charges, and that his accomplice at the time was a known gang member.</p>
        <p>The surge in gang violence  prompted the Nassau County Police Department to begin an anti-gang program in the first precinct, which is bordered by Hempstead Turnpike on the north, the Wantagh State Parkway on the east, Sunrise Highway on the south and the Hempstead Village line on the west.</p>
        <p>The program began in December 1999, and first-quarter results indicate an 82 percent rise in gang-related incidents and a 200 percent increase in gang-related arrests.</p>
        <p>''It was clear that the gang presence was growing with certain gangs, and other individual gangs were forming to protect themselves,'' said Inspector Anthony Rocco, commander of the precinct. ''We needed to take definite steps to reverse the trend. If we didn't we would lose ground and never get it back.''</p>
        <p>Some of the statistical increase is attributable to better reporting, but for the same period in 1998 there were only 2 gang-related incidents and one gang-related arrest. In 1999 the comparable figures were 23 and 10, and in 2000 they rose to 42 and 30.</p>
        <p>Gang activity is not confined to the first precinct. In all of Nassau County, there were 71 gang-related incidents and 42 arrests in the first quarter of 1999 and 142 incidents and 97 arrests in the first quarter of 2000. But the first precinct is one of the areas of heaviest gang activity.</p>
        <p>Inspector Rocco described the anti-gang program as more than just a crackdown on gang activity. Its goal, he said, is to ''make gang membership unattractive, provide avenues for youths to drop out of gangs and empower the affected communities to impact their own local problems.''</p>
        <p>Sensitive to criticism of the police department's impact on the beleaguered county budget, he emphasized that the anti-gang operation was not wasteful. ''We get the best bang for our buck by putting the officers where they should be when they should be there,'' Inspector Rocco said. ''We have cut overtime by 40 percent as compared to the same quarter last year by doing it this way. That is a real savings in money.''</p>
        <p>Sgt. John Carney, coordinator of the program, said, ''We get our officers in when we need them, not just for steady tours.''</p>
        <p>Cooperation with the schools is a big part of the program. Rashford Potter, assistant principal of Uniondale High School, said his district had been working closely with the precinct and described the initiative as excellent. ''I think it deals with a situation proactively,'' he said. ''It is dealing with the problem before it get out of control.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Potter said the police had established a two-block ''safe zone'' around the school where the police patrol and where no gang activity or appearance of gang activity is allowed.</p>
        <p>He added that one police officer is assigned to the school and that if there is a problem, they beep him rather than calling 911. ''He gets here ASAP,'' Mr. Potter said.</p>
        <p>The next phase of the program is an effort to round up gang members' guns. Inspector Rocco said that police officers will talk with parents of suspected gang members who are under 21. ''The interviews are meant to both offer advice and gather intelligence,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If it is suspected that the child has a gun, the officers will ask the parent for permission to search the child's room. Police officials will also ask parents to do the search themselves.</p>
        <p>''If the gun was not used in a crime, there will be no prosecution for the mere possession of the weapon,'' Inspector Rocco said. He added that the department wants to focus on getting the guns out of the hands of juveniles and young adults and at the same time send a ''clear message that gun possession by gang members and will not be tolerated by the police and the community.''</p>
        <p>The precinct is giving all its officers special training in gang recognition and updating them on gang activities. Officers are being encouraged to take a higher profile in the targeted areas by leaving their patrol cars and talking with the residents and taking their coffee or lunch breaks in local delis and restaurants.</p>
        <p>The initiative also coordinates other divisions in the police department including the detective division, the special investigations squad and the juvenile aid, narcotics and information systems bureaus.</p>
        <p>Clara Gillens Eromosele, executive director of the Roosevelt Assistance Corporation, a non-profit community group, said the anti-gang program had been welcomed by the residents.</p>
        <p>''It is really strange because three years ago everyone felt we did not have a gang problem,'' she said. ''It seems like over the last year or so it has become more aggressive in terms of visibility. Because we have not had a history of gangs, parents need to be aware of what to look for. Parents need to be active with children so we can suppress it before kids get in trouble and have to deal with a law enforcement officer.''</p>
        <p>She said that the police department has had numerous meetings with the community, and that the dialogue is one of the reasons the program is a success. ''We have monthly meetings and we know where the hot spots are, we know what areas are being targeted, we know why we are kept informed and the fact that the community is involved helps us to understand why things are happening. It eliminates a lot of problems. We have come a long way in developing trust. We still have a way to go in terms of the community as a whole, but we have made a lot of progress in the past three years.''</p>
        <p>''We want what every community wants, and that is a good quality of life,'' Ms. Eromosele said.'' If we participate in the process, it eliminates a lot of problems.''</p>
