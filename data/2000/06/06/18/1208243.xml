      <block class="full_text">
        <p>MOVE your right foot back a bit,'' Ian Kirby advised as he checked a student's stance. ''Lower your head.''</p>
        <p>''Now, hold your left hand like this.''</p>
        <p>He paused. ''It's like Martha Stewart beating a bloody egg,'' he said, laughing at his own fussiness -- and insistence -- that every part of the body be positioned just right.</p>
        <p>No, this isn't a golf lesson, although Mr. Kirby can certainly lay claim to knowing more about woods than even, well, Tiger Woods. Mr. Kirby is teaching woodworking in the English Arts and Crafts tradition, and he leaves little room -- in theory, at least -- for sloppy execution or haphazard methods. Things are done in a certain way, not that he expects students to catch on right away.</p>
        <p>He hastened to point out that his rigorous, systematic approach to woodworking is not really his.</p>
        <p>''All of these skills and all of these methods were developed about 100 years ago,'' said Mr. Kirby, who teaches at the Woodworkers Club in Norwalk. ''They come from the Arts and Crafts movement; they don't come from me. So when I pronounce this is the way we do it, it's not me.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people thought it through and came up with the notion that this is the best way to do what we will be doing. We hold that point of view until we can think of a better way. And although it sounds dogmatic and dictatorial, it's the only way you can express it. The techniques and skills that we use as furniture makers should be held only as long as we can't think of a better way to do it.''</p>
        <p>True to that ideal, Mr. Kirby, a 68-year-old native of England, pointed out occasional glitches in the system that he learned, glitches primarily related to inadequate understanding of wood technology by the people who taught him. Advances in science have necessitated some changes in how woodworking should be done, and Mr. Kirby embraces them.</p>
        <p>As much as he promotes the English Arts and Crafts tradition, he is also high on American craftsmanship. ''The quality of American woodworkers now is terrific,'' he said. But what American workmanship lacked until recent decades, he said, was anything approaching a cohesive methodology.</p>
        <p>''It seemed to me there was no shortage of great woodworkers, but America was just too big. The Germans had gone here and got into a bundle, and the Swedes had gone here, and they created pockets of methods of work and methods of learning that had stayed in the pocket and hadn't become universal.''</p>
        <p>In smaller Britain, it was easier for the Arts and Crafts movers and shakers to get together, at least enough to develop a coherent approach to woodworking. ''The methods they were using were thoroughly thought through,'' Mr. Kirby added.</p>
        <p>Besides teaching, he has also written extensively about woodworking. His recent books include ''The Accurate Table Saw'' (Cambium, 1998) and ''Sharpening With Waterstones'' (Cambium1998). Taken together, the books convey the British Arts and Crafts approach to proper technique as well as the movement's main tenets for building furniture.</p>
        <p>Though a dozen craftsmen might offer a dozen ways to do the same thing, there is a logic to Mr. Kirby's approach. For example, he regards the continuing debate woodworkers have over the merits of hand tools versus power tools as a non-issue. ''There's no virtue in making a thing by hand if you can get the same result from a machine,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, on a one-of-a-kind project, he observed, ''I could have the hand tools out of the box and have the thing done by the time I could set that machine up.'' Nor does he push students to invest their life savings in tools. Around $500 can buy all the basic hand tools he feels are needed, save for a bench, the most important tool of all. (The Woodworker's Club supplies all tools for Mr. Kirby's basic course, which costs $500 for five days.)</p>
        <p>His background is not solely as a woodworker, although he studied woodworking with Edward Barnsley, one of the British Arts and Crafts masters. His academic studies included design and wood technology.  As for his woodworking, Mr. Kirby writes in ''The Complete Dovetail'' (Cambium, 1999): ''I am not self-taught. I had great teachers, lots of them, so it saddens me that so many people who are interested in this craft feel they have to 'go it alone.' ''</p>
        <p>Through his books and classes, he keeps trying to rectify that situation.</p>
        <p>Where to Learn the Skills of a Craftsman</p>
        <p>The New York metropolitan region offers some good opportunities to those who want to learn woodworking with a skilled craftsman. Here are some places to get started:</p>
        <p>The Woodworkers Club</p>
        <p>Norwalk, Conn. 06851</p>
        <p>(203) 847-9663</p>
        <p>www.woodworkersclubnorwalk .com</p>
        <p>Ian Kirby will give a five-day basic skills class twice this summer, from July 10 to 14 and Aug. 21 to 25. Other crafts people teach classes during the year, and most offer weekend sessions. Some classes are given over several week nights.</p>
        <p>Fashion Institute of Technology</p>

        <p>Classes are usually held once a week on a semester basis, and the hand tools class is specifically recommended. Trying to get a catalog over the phone can be a trying experience so it is usually easier to stop by the campus and pick one up.</p>
