        <p>ONLY remnants of the hardy bulb show remain with just a smattering of the late tulips in bloom. This slow demise of spring's flower bulb color always brightens hopes in the gardener's heart that the same sort of show will go on for years to come.</p>
        <p>And then, the questions might follow, What to do now after the bulb show is over? and, What can be done to promote the same quality of bulb bloom for next year? The answers depend on the bulbs themselves.</p>
        <p>Some of the earliest-blooming bulbs such as snowdrops, glory of the snow and some crocuses have long since faded. Their green foliage has remained. This stage of their life is important because the bulbs beneath the soil surface are not idle; they are busy storing up the nutrients that the leaves are making and forming new flowers for next year.</p>
        <p>It can be quite helpful to supply these bulbs with a fertilizer high in phosphorus and potassium to strengthen the development of the new flowers. It is essential that this foliage is not cut down.</p>
        <p>The same process is going on for crocuses, which are quite often naturalized in the lawn. Again, these crocus corms are undergoing advance planning for next spring and their foliage must remain so that new  flowers are formed. When the crocus foliage begins to yellow (mature) then it will be time to mow them.</p>
        <p>Daffodils have just about completed their show, too, except for the very late cultivars. Again, this foliage must remain to renew the bulb. Daffodil foliage is probably the most long-lived of all as it does seem to take forever to mature.</p>
        <p>Garden books say that daffodil foliage matures in six weeks. But in most gardens, particularly mine, it is more like eight to 10 weeks before I begin to see any yellowing. Even before this long season, I have been known to cut the leaves down to make room for planting. So far it has not lessened any bloom.</p>
        <p>In any case, dead-heading (snapping off faded daffodil flowers) is not necessary. Most times it is done just to keep the property looking tidy. But in areas where there are acres of daffodils, dead-heading is impossible and the daffodil flowers are always just as magnificent the next year.</p>
        <p>Also, the Netherlands Flower Bulb Information Center, in New York, reminds gardeners not to tie up the daffodil leaves after bloom with string or rubber bands. The bulbs need this after-bloom time as a working period to accommodate the process of photosynthesis and the foliage must be free to soak up the sunshine and soil moisture. Leave the leaves alone!</p>
        <p>With tulips, the bulb foliage also fades and yellows after bloom. I dig them up, bulb and all. Daffodils and many other hardy spring-blooming bulbs produce offset bulbs at the sides of the mother bulbs so they can go on for many seasons. Tulips, however, grow differently. Instead of producing offsets at the sides of the mother bulb, the mother bulb flowers one season and produces a daughter bulb plus some other smaller bulbs. The old bulb is gone and the smaller bulbs do not amount to much. For this reason, it is practical to treat tulip bulbs as annuals. Dig them up after the flowers fade and plan to plant new ones again in the fall.</p>
        <p>Sometimes gardeners can make do with the smaller species or botanical tulip bulbs which seem to last for longer seasons. Fertilizer applications for these specialized tulips are especially essential now to encourage continuous display. Once the bulb display has gone by, then it is important to plan for a second display. Sometimes this is achieved by planting daffodils in the same space with day lilies. As the daffodil foliage matures, the day lilies grow to fill in the space.</p>
        <p>Another fine combination is to include some of the smaller hosta  plants with tulip displays. The tulips bloom nicely in the shady nooks where hostas thrive because the bulbs bloom before the trees leaf out and the hosta leaves are out full.</p>
        <p>Another alternative for a second display is to fill in the space with annual seedlings, such as impatiens, zinnias, marigolds or snapdragons. This plan is particularly effective for formal, long borders where daffodils or tulip bulbs are set. With this scheme, the colorful effect continues and it is often fascinating to vary the annual selections each year to keep the flower display interesting.</p>
