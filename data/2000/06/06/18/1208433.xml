        <p>What a difference a month can make. According to a survey last week, there was not a single economist at any major bond firm that expected the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this month.</p>
        <p>Last month, 21 of the 29 primary dealers -- firms that trade directly with the Fed -- expected that it would raise its lending target by a quarter-point. The turnaround in sentiment began on June 2, as a report of falling employment added to evidence that the Fed's six rate increases in the last year might be slowing economic growth.</p>
        <p>Most dealers changed their minds that day about a possible June rate rise. The  final four holdouts followed suit last week, once reports showed that retail sales dropped for a second month and that the inflation rate was tame.</p>
        <p>''The bond market is sniffing the end'' of the rate increases, said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, which has $75 billion under management. ''Even if there are lingering inflation fears,'' he added, the slowdown in  growth will keep the Fed from raising rates much more, if at all.</p>
        <p>Seventeen of the firms still expect the central bank to raise the federal funds rate, now at 6.5 percent, by a quarter-point in August, the survey showed. Eight firms predict an increase of half a point.</p>
