      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Marlene Barron, head of the West Side Montessori School, explained that she did not admit a ''fine, perfectly acceptable child'' because the mother kept ''trying to give the right answer'' (The Way We Live Now, May 21). So, the key to admission is to give the ''right'' answer but not look as if you're trying. What happens when a child is accepted and it turns out that the mother is just better at faking the subjective quality Barron is seeking? And what does this have to do with the child anyway?</p>
