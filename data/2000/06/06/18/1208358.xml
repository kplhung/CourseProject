        <p>WILLIAMSBURG  Friday Night Art At 20-Odd Galleries</p>
        <p>Williamsburg and Greenpoint are home to more than 20 galleries less than two miles from the Bedford Avenue subway stop, yet visits have  not always been easy, because of hidden locations and changeable schedules. On Friday night, the artists will make it easy: during ''Open Williamsburg,'' more than 20 galleries will open their doors to the public.</p>
        <p>The spaces vary from museum-style galleries to a pristine shed in a backyard garden, and the participating artists have come from as far as Amsterdam and Tokyo (though most  are from Williamsburg). The event is organized in conjunction with Open Source: Networking Artists and Artists Organizations.</p>

        <p>LOWER MANHATTAN  Launching a Boat And a Festival</p>
        <p>For two months, junior high and high school students from around the city have been building a 19th-century racing boat, a 25-foot, four-oared Whitehall gig (a twin of the one pictured below). The boat has been named the American Star in honor of the boat that defeated a British rival in a harbor race in 1824. The American Star will be launched on Tuesday to kick off the Hudson River Festival, a summerlong series of free music, dance, art and puppetry.</p>
        <p>The nightcap to kickoff day is a concert starring Pete Seeger, who will be joined onstage by his grandson, Tao Rodriquez.</p>
