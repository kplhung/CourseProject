        <p>''Parents Try to Reclaim Their Children's Time'' (news article, June 13) noted parents' fears of what might be lost by cutting back afterschool activities, like potential college athletic scholarship money.</p>
        <p>It seems as if ''family values'' often suffer from a lack of focus on developing healthy children and are instead represented by parents' own ego-driven pursuit to make their children better athletes while benchmarking their community with wins and losses.</p>
