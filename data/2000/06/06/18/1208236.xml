        <p>GVA WILLIAMS, a Manhattan-based commercial real estate services company with a national and international reach, wanted a stronger presence just across the Hudson River in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>And Associated Realty, a commercial brokerage company in Parsippany, was entrenched in the state but wanted to expand worldwide.</p>
        <p>Six weeks ago, GVA Williams bought Associated Realty, which has been renamed GVA Williams New Jersey. The move enabled both companies to meet their goals to  ''better compete in the market and improve services to our clients in the region,'' said Michael T. Cohen, the president and chief executive of GVA Williams, the parent company.</p>
        <p>The new company, which will operate from Associated's current office in Parsippany, will be headed by Eric Witmondt, who founded Associated nine years ago. His title will be chief executive, and David Simson, a former senior vice president in the New Jersey office of CB Richard Ellis, will be the company's president.</p>
        <p>The deal reflects the continuing trend of consolidation in the commercial real estate brokerage industry, although at a less frenzied pace than a few years ago. The trend, many industry executives said, better meets the needs of global corporate clients who are demanding national and international management and brokerage capabilities.</p>
        <p>Moreover, they add, as corporations farm out the real estate operations they once handled internally, they have also become  unwilling to deal with different service providers in multiplying markets.</p>
        <p>''After the downsizing and outsourcing by corporations in the late 80's and early 90's,  strong brokerage companies became more important,'' said Stan Kurzweil, the president of the New Jersey chapter of the Society of Industrial and Office Realtors and a  vice president in the Somerset office of Colliers Houston &amp; Company, a brokerage company based in Teaneck. Corporations now want ''a seamless delivery of service and a single source of contact,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In time, many real estate executives predict, there will be a few large multinational companies that will dominate the market. Though smaller, entrepreneurial companies will survive as niche players, the pressure, they said, will be on larger regional companies to acquire or be acquired.</p>
        <p>''The industry is evolving into a two-tier business with three or four or five national and international firms and a lot of local brokerages,'' said Donald P. Eisen, an executive managing director for the New York area at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the international real estate services company. ''It's all about branding and harnessing resources, putting companies in the middle in a very difficult place to defend.''</p>
        <p>As a corollary, a very strong office market now exists in the 11 counties of northern and central New Jersey. Brokerage companies of all sizes are seeking to become important players in one of the largest markets in the nation, with 147 million square feet of office space and 724 million square feet of industrial space in the 11 counties. The area is also home to a couple of dozen Fortune 500 companies, many of which are expanding.</p>
        <p>''The demand is there, and so are the larger transactions as corporations look for headquarters and full-building deals,'' said Thomas Giannone, one of two managers in  the Edison office of the Julien J. Studley real estate services company. ''Everyone is jockeying for these larger, more lucrative deals, which require a higher level of services.''</p>
        <p>Joining networks is one tactic being embraced by smaller, independent companies, including Alexander Summer L.L.C., the Garibaldi Group and most recently, the Schultz Organization. Generally, networks are confederations of independent companies in different geographic locations that  refer business to one another and share the revenue generated. By linking, the companies can offer clients access to affiliates elsewhere in the nation or the world.</p>
        <p>EARLIER this month, the Schultz Organization, a full-service commercial real estate company in Woodbridge that focuses on regional and institutional clients in New Jersey, joined TCN Real Estate Services of Dallas, a brokerage network with 58 offices worldwide.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Schultz, the president of the 10-broker company, he had resisted being acquired by or merging with a larger company to retain his entrepreneurial edge. ''There is a host of regional companies in New Jersey that want the services we provide, so there is still room for firms like us,'' Mr. Schultz said. ''But this is all client-driven, and for our clients that want us to service their needs outside New Jersey, a network affords us a way to do that.''</p>
        <p>The 15-broker Garibaldi Group in Chatham, whose national clients include Bristol-Myers Squibb and Schering-Plough, is affiliated with Corfac International, a real estate brokerage network with 76 offices worldwide. Its headquarters are in Arlington, Va.  ''In today's global economy you're expected to have greater depth and reach,'' said James J. Garibaldi, the company's chief executive. Now, with many clients expanding west into Pennsylvania, he said his company was planning to open an office in Lehigh Valley, Pa.</p>
        <p>Big multinational companies like Cushman &amp; Wakefield and Insignia/ESG see the present as a good time to expand in the state.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey has a large supply of office space and a diverse geography, but a highly fractured market in terms of service providers that over time will see more consolidation,'' said Patrick Murphy, the executive director of Insignia/ESG of New Jersey, in Saddle Brook. ''Other than Cushman &amp; Wakefield, no one else has an significant market share, so we see opportunities to grow.''</p>
        <p>He said that within the next two weeks his company planned to open a second office in New Brunswick and was in the process of forming an alliance with Buschman Partners, a Princeton concern with four brokers.  Insignia/ESG, a publicly traded company, now has offices in 48 states and in 13 countries. The New Jersey office also has expanded its research and consulting services and by the middle of next year will increase its New Jersey staff to 50 from the current 35, Mr. Murphy said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eisen of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, which has 143 offices in 44 countries, said his company sees ''New Jersey as the high growth sector for the metropolitan area and intends to exploit our advantage in the state.''</p>
        <p>The plan, he said, is to recruit more people and to open a third office in the state, in Iselin, by this summer. The two existing offices now have 50 brokers, and the third office would add 12 to 15 more.</p>
        <p>GVA Williams is not a newcomer to the New Jersey market. For the last decade the company has had an alliance with Jacobson, Goldfarb &amp; Tanzman, which has 28 brokers in Woodbridge, but that affiliation has now ended. Stanley Simon, the company's chief executive, said: ''We were in it for the New York connection, but the affiliation didn't have a great impact on our prosperity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon said that he was not sure if his company would join another network. ''We will rely on our experience as a dominant player in central New Jersey and expand services, going into retail as well as asset and property management.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen of GVA Williams said the acquisition of Associated Realty was driven by his company's desire to grow in the New York metropolitan area, countering the popular belief that regional companies will get squeezed out.</p>
        <p>The acquisition will offer clients uniform services and technological capabilities, important pluses, he said, since the markets in New York and New Jersey are so intertwined but difficult to achieve in an informal alliance. Since GVA Williams is a founding member of GVA Worldwide, a network of affiliates in 20 countries, the company can also offer one-stop services to clients with national and international requirements.</p>
        <p>''Our vision is to expand strategically in this region by buying companies and building partnerships,'' Mr. Cohen said, noting that with Associated, ''we bought a controlling interest and kept the partners on by giving them an equity stack.'' Mr. Witmondt and Mr. Simson said that they each had equity in the company, but they would not name the percentage.</p>
        <p>Future plans include opening a second office in New Jersey, adding to its staff of 14 brokers, and expanding into Westchester, Long Island and Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Mr. Witmondt said that by joining GVA Williams, his company gained a global reach ''that would have taken us years to cultivate'' as well as technological resources ''that would have cost us millions of dollars to achieve.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen conceded that in the race all brokerage companies are running, Williams's approach was conservative. ''We are the tortoise, rather than the hare,'' he said.</p>
