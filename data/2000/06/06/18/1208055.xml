        <p>Motherhood Made a Man Out of Me</p>
        <p>By Karen Karbo.</p>
        <p>212 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Bloomsbury. $23.95.</p>
        <p>MY mother once got a letter from a friend raving about her newborn daughter's ''little hands and little feet and little blue eyes.'' The ''little'' before ''blue eyes'' had been crossed out and replaced with ''big'' -- a good example of how hard it is to write about new babies in a way that means anything to anyone except new parents. In her peevishly hilarious third novel, Karen Karbo throws down the gauntlet in her opening paragraph:</p>
        <p>''I am a terrible mother. I love my daughter, love her so much I'm amazed I actually have to hold her in my arms, that she doesn't just stick to my side, my heart heavy as a black hole, dense with love, trying to suck her into it. I love her like this, then, minutes later, can't wait to get out of the house, leaving her behind. I'm told all mothers are like this, more or less, and are all racked with guilt because of it.''</p>
        <p>What Karbo's narrator, Brooke, might as well be saying is: ''I just had a baby, and you're going to be hearing a lot about her in this novel. I can't help it -- I'm trying to tell a whole big story, but the baby keeps getting in the way.''</p>
        <p>''Motherhood Made a Man Out of Me'' contains two plots that are intertwined and equally weighted. There's the story of Brooke, the new mother of baby Stella, and her husband, Lyle -- a mildly annoying, mildly dim would-be artist who can't understand why the fact that he looked after Stella for one evening a few weeks ago doesn't prove he's a good father. Then there's the story of Brooke's best friend, Mary Rose, a pregnant gardener who's engaged to marry Brooke's cousin Ward -- a mildly annoying, mildly dim director of ''high-profile commercials'' who forgot to tell Mary Rose that he's still married. (''I should have told you about Lynne. I should have, but this all happened so fast and I never think of her. She never crosses my mind.'')</p>
        <p>These four characters (and Stella) are easy to keep track of, but there are dozens of others. Almost before the book has begun, we're having Thanksgiving dinner at Ward's parents' house, and it's exactly like a real dinner at the house of people you don't know very well: quick intros all around, and then you have to fend for yourself. Throughout the novel, characters are thrown at us and we're just expected to keep track of them somehow. We see one of Mary Rose's downstairs neighbors -- part of a couple that's ''either Tom and Bob or Greg and Ted'' -- a single time, when he lets Brooke into the building, and the next thing we know he's moved away. Other names pop up -- Fleabo, Itchy Sister, Dr. Vertamini -- with little bits of characters tacked onto them.</p>
        <p>The city where this is all taking place is never mentioned by name. It must be Portland, Ore., because it's always rainy and people are always watching Trail Blazers games, but I checked a million times and never found the word ''Portland'' in the text. Brooke always calls it ''our city.'' Why?</p>
        <p>In the same way, segments of plot bob up without warning from under a thick layer of domestic detail. (The details are very funny; there are just so many of them!) Mary Rose and Brooke spend a momentous evening out with two professional basketball players -- an evening that, despite its drastic consequences for both women, leaves less of an impression than the contents of one of Stella's diapers. ''I did tend to rhapsodize about the wonder of Stella's 'projects,' ''Brooke says in a passage all new parents will understand. ''Steam and cut a carrot into bite-sized bits and a mere 12 hours later there they are again, bright and square as ever, cradled in her diaper amid an aromatic little dollop of guacamole-ish doo.'' Similarly, when Mary Rose is giving birth, Brooke suddenly drops her conversational tone to interject -- with clinical exactness -- I heard the snip-snip of scissors, heralding an episiotomy, the clip at the top of the perineum that enlarges the vaginal opening just before birth.'' Meanwhile, we barely know what any of the characters look like.</p>
        <p>But that's because this book is really about having babies, and it's the plot that keeps getting in the way. True, Mary Rose's baby, Patricia, turns out to be a bit of a surprise. True, someone tries to kidnap her a few days after she's born. But even these developments are pitched in the same wisecracking, bemused voice that Karbo uses to describe Brooke's spats with Lyle or the potato chips at a health food store. Motherhood is the main character here (as I guess the book's title would suggest).</p>
        <p>Is there any aspect to being a mom -- stretch marks, fat sagging over the top of the elastic waistband, baby spit-up everywhere -- that Erma Bombeck hasn't already trampled into the ground? Fortunately, yes. There are plenty of stretch marks in this book, but there are also plenty of fresh discoveries, like the pregnant cellist in Mary Rose's Lamaze class. ''As with many aspects of pregnancy, the difficult part was not what you might expect: It was the calluses on the ends of the cellist's fingers that were giving her pains; new blisters formed with every incremental readjustment of the instrument, made to accommodate her expanding belly. Mary Rose was amazed. It was the same with her and her rototiller.''</p>
        <p>AND Karbo's portrayal of the squalor and hatred that bubble under the surface of every marriage with a new baby is way too accurate. ''Dinner now was us standing in the middle of the kitchen, eating whatever straight from the refrigerator: cheese, peanut butter on celery, Nestle chocolate-chip cookie dough straight from its yellow tube.'' When Brooke, wandering through a grocery store, starts brooding about Mary Rose's sporty independence and can't remember the name of the goddess Artemis, she realizes she could ask Lyle, who would know it right off -- except I was irritated with Lyle, was always irritated with Lyle these days, and would punish him by not asking him when I got home.''</p>
        <p>''Motherhood Made a Man Out Of Me'' should be clutched to the ''corn-silo-sized'' breasts of every new mother. I'm not sure how much it will resonate with people who don't have kids, or who had kids so long ago that they've stuffed all their memories of postnatal trauma under the sofa cushions. But I hope they read it anyway. New mothers need all the help they can get -- even if we can avoid actually providing it by sneaking off to study this book.</p>
