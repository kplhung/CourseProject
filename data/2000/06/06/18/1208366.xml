        <p>Ana Garcia and Gabriel Dionisio, break dancers in Manhattan, were married yesterday afternoon at St. Cecilia's Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan. The Rev. Francis Skelly performed the ceremony.</p>
        <p>The bride, 28, is a daughter of Angelina Falcon-Garcia and Vicente Garcia of North Bergen, N.J. She grew up in Manhattan and began dancing on the streets in 1991 with a break-dancing troupe. That year, she met Mr. Dionisio, 32, who also grew up in North Bergen. He is the son of Anthony Dionisio. Mr. Dionisio's stage name is Kwikstep; Ms. Garcia is known as Rokafella, because she often danced outside Rockefeller Center.</p>
        <p>''We met dancing on the street -- dancing for money,'' Ms. Garcia said. ''He struck a chord in my heart from the beginning. I liked his perspective on life, how things go in cycles, and there's ups and downs. I was so used to having downs, downs, downs. And his vision for the future was so positive.''</p>
        <p>When they met, both were living on the money they collected in buckets from passers-by. (On a good day, they said, they could make $150 to $250 each.) ''We were so used to counting change,'' Mr. Dionisio said. ''There were times when I paid the rent in quarters and dimes.''</p>
        <p>They started dating in 1994, when Ms. Garcia joined his new dance troupe, Ghettoriginal, for a European tour. ''I thought he was too good for me,'' she remembered. ''I just wanted to dance and one day have kids, and he had these big global dreams.''</p>
        <p>Now they have many of the same dreams, dancing together in their own troupe, Full Circle Souljahz. They have performed in music videos and television commercials and last New Year's Eve, they danced for President Clinton's party at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. They also teach break dancing at the Point, a community center in the Hunt's Point section of the Bronx, and visit New York City schools to talk to the students about subjects like new break-dancing moves and the importance of being equal partners in marriage.</p>
        <p>''We show them a different version of what urban can be,'' Mr. Dionisio said. ''It doesn't have to be rough and angry.'' They now pay for groceries with checks instead of quarters. But, the bridegroom said, ''We keep a bottle of change around so we never forget where we came from.''</p>
        <p>Last October, he proposed to her onstage after dancing in a show they choreographed, ''Soular Powr'd,'' at Hostos Community College in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''People always ask me, 'Why did I want to marry Rokafella?' '' Mr. Dionisio said. ''I tell them: She's my best friend, she's a good cook, and she has a real sweet backspin.''</p>
