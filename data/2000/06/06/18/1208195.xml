        <p>AS another school year winds down, most school districts shift from academic pressures to carefree thoughts of summer vacation.</p>
        <p>But 19 districts on the Island have faced the challenge of second votes on budget proposals that were defeated last month.</p>
        <p>Among them are four districts -- Port Washington and Herricks in Nassau and Elwood and Patchogue-Medford in Suffolk -- where the budgets were voted down despite the fact that the proposed increases fell below the 7 percent average.</p>
        <p>In Port Washington and Herricks, the budget defeats were tied to bond referendums that were also rejected by voters sending the message that they would not support spending they viewed as excessive. In Patchogue-Medford, after approval in March of a bond just under $150 million, voters said No to a budget that would have raised taxes further.</p>
        <p>In these three districts, contentious school board elections also contributed to the budget defeats. Though the newly elected board members, some of whom were vigorously antibudget or antibond, do not take office until July, they participated informally in revising the numbers for the new votes.</p>
        <p>Votes in other districts last Tuesday sent mixed signals about what might happen in the four voting on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>In Sachem, a large bond issue for a new high school and new middle school -- $228.6 million -- passed comfortably, 4,314 to 3,977. Smaller bonds were approved in Sayville and Middle Country districts.</p>
        <p>But bond proposals lost in Plainedge and Cold Spring Harbor.</p>
        <p>Elwood</p>
        <p>There was no contentious school board election, no major controversial issues and strong community approval for a $25 million bond passed by Elwood residents in February, so it is unclear why the budget, with a relatively modest increase of 4.8 percent, was defeated.</p>
        <p>During the weeks since the Island-wide budget vote on May 16, administrators and incumbent school board members have been working to trim their budget proposals, hoping that voters will approve the lower figures on the second vote.</p>
        <p>In Elwood, residents vote tomorrow on a budget that has been pared by $94,800, bringing the increase from last year down to 4.4 percent.</p>
        <p>The defeat of the original budget by four votes, 682 to 678. took the district by surprise, according to the superintendent of schools, Michael Maina.</p>
        <p>''It was a relatively quiet year,'' he said, ''and we think primarily it was a case in which residents felt there were no major issues and did not come out to vote. The turnout was smaller then usual, and many people told us afterwards that they didn't bother to vote because they assumed the budget would pass.''</p>
        <p>There may also have been confusion over a separate referendum to continue a fee for services at the public library, Mr. Maina said. ''This may have obscured the budget, even though it was a totally separate issue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Reductions for the revised budget resulted from one teacher's retirement and lower costs associated with hiring four replacement teachers to cover unexpected maternity leaves.</p>
        <p>''If this budget is approved,'' Mr. Maina said, ''we will be able to continue all programs and services next year.''</p>
        <p>Patchogue-Medford</p>
        <p>The budget in the Patchogue-Medford district was also defeated by a small margin, 1,364 to 1,419, and the $98.5 million proposal has been reduced by just $38,000 for the new vote, scheduled for Tuesday. The revision lowered the tax increase for the average homeowner to $63 a year, from $73.</p>
        <p>Rejection of the budget in Patchogue-Medford was seen as a backlash against a bond issue of just under $150 million that was passed earlier to build additional space in the district's 11 schools.</p>
        <p>''There was some confusion among residents who associated the bond referendum with the budget,'' said the superintendent, Raymond Fell. ''They felt that since they passed the bond, there should be a zero percent tax increase. They didn't understand that the bond is a 20-year program but the budget is a one-year spending plan. Since you can't take money from the bond for the operating budget, a zero increase was impossible.''</p>
        <p>But some members of the school board felt otherwise, and these divisions led to a contentious election for the three of the seven seats.</p>
        <p>The board president, Tina Weeks, who retained her seat in the election, said: ''I opposed the budget because we promised the community that we would keep things level. A 2.8 percent budget increase may sound small, but on $98 million, that's a lot of money. The community is concerned about taxes and how money is being spent, and the board has to listen.''</p>
        <p>Superintendent Fell, optimistic that the community will pass the budget this week, said: ''We feel that this is a very responsible budget. Our tax rate is one of the lowest.''</p>
        <p>Herricks</p>
        <p>After the surprise defeat of the Herricks budget, with an increase of only 4.57 percent, the district reduced its proposal by about $400,000, representing a 3.82 percent increase.</p>
        <p>On June 27, residents will vote both on the revised budget and on a new referendum for a bond that has been cut to $24.2 million, from the $39.5 million proposal defeated in March. The new bond eliminates the expansion of libraries and noninstructional spaces, and an all-day kindergarten.</p>
        <p>Unrest has been worsened by a school board election that unseated the incumbent president, and the sudden departure by the superintendent in the middle of the year.</p>
        <p>''We can't quite put our hand on why the bond and budget were defeated,'' said the interim superintendent, Ronald Barnes. ''We knew there was unrest in Nassau County, but other districts passed their budgets. Right now, it's unclear what the message is.''</p>
        <p>Port Washington</p>
        <p>Residents of the Port Washington district vote Tuesday on a sharply revised budget, cut by $1,133,808 from the defeated version. The new budget -- $74 million, an increase of 4.65 percent instead of 6.25 percent -- eliminates several key items: portable classrooms for the middle school, several staff positions, late buses, purchases of new vehicles and spending for conferences, travel and summer workshops.</p>
        <p>A much-debated $86.7 million bond that was proposed to reorganize the district and expand the existing schools will not be presented again until it has been reviewed further. The bond, which was defeated by 2,000 votes in one of the highest voter turnouts in recent district history, was also the nub of a heated school board election that led to the ouster of three incumbents.</p>
        <p>''It was a very emotional issue for the community,'' said Albert F. Inserra, the superintendent. ''Everyone agrees that we need to do something to deal with the problematic space issue, but the community obviously felt that the original bond was too high.</p>
        <p>''People said No for many reasons. Some were upset with the plan, others thought it was too costly or felt it would be too difficult to manage the construction. The part that has hurt us the most is the loss of portable classrooms to handle the increasing number of students.''</p>
        <p>The first priority of the new board will be to revise the bond, he said, in order to present it again by late fall.</p>
        <p>With only one final chance to win approval from voters for their budgets, these four Long Island districts have heightened last-minute efforts to gain passage. If the budgets are defeated a second time, districts must adopt austerity budgets, which cover only long-term commitments to staff members and maintenance and often mean a reduction in extracurricular activities.</p>
        <p>If the new Herricks budget is defeated, Dr. Barnes said, ''the district will be forced to reduce another $1.3 million.''</p>
        <p>''This will seriously handicap our schools in moving forward with all programs,'' he continued. ''If the bond referendum goes down, we won't be able to vote again until next April, and that will put us a year behind in terms of fulfilling classroom space that we desperately need for our students.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, in Port Washington, an austerity budget would mean cutting another $1 million, Dr. Inserra said. ''Now that the budget is clearly distinguishable from the bond,'' he added, ''I'm hopeful that the community will recognize the need to get an operational budget and will support it.''</p>
        <p>The New Boards</p>
        <p>Across the Island, the newly elected school board members officially take their positions next month. During the weeks since their election, they have sat in on budget meetings and offered their insights, but have been unable to vote.</p>
        <p>In some districts the transition has been smoother than others.</p>
        <p>In Elwood, an uneventful board election in which one incumbent ran unopposed and two candidates ran for a vacant seat, left no hard feelings, said Mr. Maina.</p>
        <p>At the other extreme, in Port Washington, three incumbents were defeated in an emotionally charged election, leaving lingering bitter feelings and a rockier transition for new members.</p>
        <p>It has been extremely difficult for departing incumbents to work on revising the budget, said Roy Nelson, the board president, who lost his seat.</p>
        <p>''An election in which two members of the board actively campaigned against the budget, the bond and against three incumbent school board members who were up for re-election galvanized different segments of the community to vote No  and divided the community as much as anything could,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Now we've been asked to take a successful district and look for ways to do things more cheaply, which is very difficult.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, in Herricks and in Patchogue-Medford, the board's split over budget issues have created tension among members in making educational decisions.</p>
        <p>In all districts, new board members have been spending time with superintendents, visiting schools and meeting administrators and staff. Many will attend one of two orientations run by the New York State School Boards Association, in July and October.</p>
        <p>Robert Ferro, a new board member in Port Washington, said: ''I'm looking forward to the challenge. I've been doing a lot of reading and trying to get orientated as fast as possible. It's a big commitment, because there will be some difficult decisions to make in the next year.''</p>
