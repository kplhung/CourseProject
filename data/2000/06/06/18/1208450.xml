        <p>The Dome Garden, at 84th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, will reopen this summer after being closed for more than a year, according to officials at the adjacent high school.</p>
        <p>''The garden is not just being ignored,'' said Deena Forman, who is the principal of the school, Louis D. Brandeis. She said the opening was delayed until people could be hired to maintain the school-run plot.</p>
        <p>Beginning in July, the principal said, students and teachers would  start working in the garden. Along with tending the plants, students  would also be able to use the space to complement environmental science and sketching classes.</p>
        <p>The tiny garden is owned by the Board of Education and is next to the school's playground. Safety issues,  rats, garbage and overgrown weeds prompted the School Construction Authority to close the area in spring  1999.</p>
        <p>Debra Perry, a spokeswoman for the School Construction Authority, said the agency cleaned the area, replaced cracked tiles, put down wood chips and performed other tasks. The repairs were completed last October and control of the site was returned to the school at that time.</p>
        <p>Ms. Forman said she was working with Community Board 7 to ensure that community gardeners would also be accommodated when the garden reopened next month. They have been the plot's primary users since it was created in 1996.</p>
        <p>Still, the shiny silver chains and padlock on the garden gate is cause for concern among some community residents who think of it as a public park that should be open for their use.</p>
        <p>''It was never really a totally open garden,'' Ms. Forman said. ''That property was always part of the school. Because it is part of the school, it just can't be open all day long.''</p>
