        <p>Frank Mickel letter on Donald E Westlake's May 28 review of Susan Schmidt and Michael Weisskopf's book Truth at Any Cost and about cheating at golf2</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I have not read Susan Schmidt and Michael Weisskopf's ''Truth at Any Cost,'' reviewed by Donald E. Westlake (May 28), but to your many golfing readers, I am sure Westlake's credibility has suffered. He seems to find it preposterous for the authors to criticize President Clinton for cheating at golf. I would caution Westlake that most golfers (including past presidents) take the honor of the game very seriously. Golf history is filled with inspiring stories of golfers who called penalties on themselves when the stakes were high, even though nobody was watching. I am sorry I do not know the origin of the following quotation: ''There may be men who cheat at life who do not cheat at golf, but there are no men who cheat at golf who do not cheat at life.''</p>
