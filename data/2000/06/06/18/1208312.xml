        <p>Sandi Kimmel says that she has finally been able to get what she wanted. It just took her a while to figure out what that was.</p>
        <p>What she has now is her first CD, ''Transitions -- Music to Soothe the Soul,'' a collection of 15 original songs based on her belief in the healing power of music. She also has a program, ''Spirit, Story and Song,'' which she takes on the road to hospitals, nursing homes and other forums.</p>
        <p>Both grew out of work as a hospice volunteer that Mr. Kimmel, a Tarrytown resident, began after leaving a job in corporate public relations several years ago to explore other paths, both in careers and matters of the spirit. .</p>
        <p>Ms. Kimmel is performing at a June 24 benefit sponsored by the Lions Club of Bedford Hills. Admission is $5 for the 7 p.m.  program at Bedford Community House at Church and Main Streets in Bedford.</p>
        <p>''Transitions'' was produced independently with John Guth, who plays acoustic guitar on the CD (there's also a cassette). It is available at Awakenings in Katonah, Sunburst in Mount Kisco and Star Visions in Chappaqua. It is also for sale online at amazon.com and cdbaby.com, as well as at Ms. Kimmel's own Web site, www.music healer.com.</p>
