        <p>How To Read And Why</p>
        <p>By Harold Bloom.</p>
        <p>283 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Scribner. $25.</p>
        <p>HAROLD BLOOM is one of the few literary critics about whom it's both possible and interesting to think in terms of periods. Early Bloom is the author of ''The Visionary Company'' and other books on Romantic poetry. For a teacher, this is Bloom at his most useful: I have cribbed more classes than I care to admit from his readings of individual poems. It's also Bloom at his most finely grained, though he doesn't put the kind</p>
        <p>of pressure on particular words and phrases as have such peers as Christopher Ricks and Helen Vendler. Instead, he conveys a sense of poetry as human utterance, showing -- without much recourse to biography -- just why Wordsworth or Keats at a certain point in his career had to write a certain poem.</p>
        <p>Middle Bloom is altogether dicier, more ambitious and less helpful, a theorist attempting to explain the history of English verse as the struggle of the individual strong poet against his (almost always his) predecessors. This is the Bloom one reads in graduate school, and I can indeed remember ''The Anxiety of Influence'' as having initially baffled and even angered me. Not by its argument, which in outline looks sensible enough. No, what's troubling is its language, a style in which words difficult in themselves -- clinamen, kenosis -- are assigned wholly private meanings, in which Blakean aphorism and allegory too often substitute for analysis and example. Though Bloom's model seems powerful, his terminology has never gained much traction, and perhaps its major influence has come in its rejection by feminist critics -- as if he were himself the precursor whose work must be overthrown.</p>
        <p>Late Bloom lays claim to everything: America, the Bible, the secret of what makes us human. Some of his recent books attempt to turn poetry and Scripture into each other, water into wine and back again, but the main texts here are ''The Western Canon'' and his best-selling ''Shakespeare.'' These are always better in bulk than in detail -- not in his readings of particular works but rather in his general emphasis on the ''strangeness'' of great writers, an ''originality that either cannot be assimilated, or that so assimilates us that we cease to see it as strange.'' It's been easy for specialists to condescend to these books, and especially to attack Bloom's account of what he calls ''the School of Resentment'' -- basically, any idea that ends in ''ism,'' from multiculturalism to the New Historicism. But although one may find his jeremiad against ''social change through academic ideology'' simplistic, it's hard not to be stirred by the zest of his admirations, by his juicily hyperbolic celebration of the writers he most admires. Is it hubris or humility that makes Bloom write of Shakespeare that ''his intellect is superior to mine''? Of whom else would he say it? And yet few critics today would make such an admission about anyone.</p>
        <p>Now comes ''How to Read and Why,'' a slender volume that might uncharitably be called ''Bloom's Notes'' or ''The Canon Lite,'' a book that resembles nothing so much as an instructor's manual for one of those anthologies through which students are introduced to literary study. A section on short stories -- Turgenev and Chekhov to Borges and Calvino -- is succeeded by one on poetry, a bit of Tennyson and Browning, some Dickinson, a smattering of Shakespeare and the Romantics. Then there's a chapter on the novel from Cervantes to Mann (all by Europeans, except for Henry James), followed by an essay on ''Hamlet'' and looks at plays by Ibsen and Wilde, before we end with American fiction from Melville to Morrison. The novels might be bought separately, but virtually everything else Bloom considers would fit into one slim anthology. It would be a good anthology, though one whose selections seem terribly safe, and would provide the basis of a good course for beginning students. But ''How to Read and Why'' is not a good book.</p>
        <p>This has little to do with Bloom's critical premises. In his preface, he offers a superb definition of literary criticism itself, writing that its purpose is ''to make what is implicit in a book finely explicit,'' and his opening statement about why we should read is persuasive and even moving. Reading, he argues, is ''the most healing of pleasures''; it returns us ''to otherness'' and yet also makes us ''wholly ourselves.'' It is a solitary activity that nevertheless ''alleviates loneliness'' and in doing so provides a replacement for friendship, which is ''so vulnerable, so likely to diminish or disappear, overcome by space, time, imperfect sympathies and all the sorrows of familial and passional life.'' Yet ''it is not the function of reading to cheer us up, or to console us prematurely.'' (That last word is very nicely judged.) All this seems fine, and a volume that might help quicken the common reader's sense of excitement and purpose would indeed be a valuable one. So let me recommend two: ''The Pleasures of Reading in an Ideological Age,'' by Robert Alter, and ''Great Books,'' by David Denby, both of which cover some of Bloom's territory and do so with a specificity and panache this book lacks.</p>
        <p>''How to Read and Why'' is, among other things, much too short. Bloom's section on poetry opens with a single page on Housman, followed by a bit less than that on Blake -- poets whom he uses to suggest ''a first principle for how to read poems: closely, because a true criterion for any good poem is that it will sustain a very close reading indeed.'' If only he had provided one! But Bloom has said almost everything that is here before -- and better -- at greater length and with a more nuanced sense of detail. What, for example, is the difference between a ''first principle'' and what, two pages later, he calls a ''first crux'' in the reading of poems (''wherever possible, memorize them'')? The advice is unexceptionable, the repetitive phrasing troublesome.</p>
        <p>Some of his judgments seem questionable at best. Does poetry really tend to be ''freer from history than are prose fiction or drama''? (Think of Pope or Ezra Pound.) When Bloom deals with short stories, he relies on plot summary and platitudes -- Chekhov is ''the indispensable artist of the unlived life'' -- and yet nevertheless finds time, in just over five pages on the Russian master, to mention Shakespeare 11 times and to distract himself with a comparison between Balzac and Dickens.</p>
        <p>What's especially irritating is the way in which, about halfway through and as though obeying an editor's injunction, Bloom starts to conclude his chapters by answering one of the questions implicit in his title. But after six whole pages on Proust a one-sentence answer to ''How to read a novel?'' seems just a bit too easy, and at times his suggestions sound rather like the ''social change through academic ideology'' that he has elsewhere denounced. Why read Nathanael West's ''Miss Lonelyhearts''? Among other things, ''to understand better our obsession with guns and violence.''</p>
        <p>And yet every few pages Bloom startles with a wild surmise; quotes a passage in a way that makes you fall under its spell; offers an invaluable throwaway comment on, say, the difficulties of Milton or Dickens's sense of audience. He is especially good on the American fiction of his own time, writing beautifully of the cultural centrality of ''Invisible Man'' and persuasively on ''The Crying of Lot 49.'' His treatment of Cormac McCarthy's ''Blood Meridian'' makes me want to read it, all the more so because of his honesty in admitting its ''overwhelming carnage'' ensured that his own ''first two attempts . . . failed.''</p>
        <p>Why should we read? Bloom's answer is that ''only deep, constant reading fully establishes and augments an autonomous self.'' Read not to change the world or to be a better person but simply to know, to become, yourself. How to read ''How to Read and Why''? Without expecting much, but prepared to be surprised into perception by a critic who, like a singer all hoarse and with his top notes gone, can still, now and then, when he wants to, put a song across.</p>
