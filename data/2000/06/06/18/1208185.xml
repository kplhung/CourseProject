        <p>THE rising tide of year-round visitors to East End wineries crests in the warm-weather months. A comparable heightening in attention over the last decade suggests that the press is taking producers more seriously too.</p>
        <p>As Thomas Matthews, Wine Spectator's executive editor, wrote in the June 15 issue: ''Long Island, especially the North Fork, has clearly emerged as the regional leader in the eastern United States.''</p>
        <p>After inviting producers from six states to submit wines for tasting, he reviewed nearly 90 from 31 producers from Massachusetts to Virginia.</p>
        <p>''Besides producing the two best wines, the exuberantly fruity 1999 Pellegrini merlot,'' which scored 90, ''and the concentrated 1995 Cupola,'' a Bordeaux-style blend from Bedell (90), ''Long Island topped every varietal category in the tasting,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>But for most of the individual wines submitted by 15 East End wineries, a score was Mr. Matthews's sole comment. And it was one of the tail-enders in the scoring that was noteworthy.</p>
        <p>The Lenz Winery's average score (77.7) tied with Hargrave's for last place. Lenz's '96 gold label chardonnay scored 76; its '95 merlot, 78; its '96 gewurztraminer, 79.</p>
        <p>Wine Spectator defines a 70- to 79-point wine as ''average, a drinkable wine that may have minor flaws.'' In stores, numbers-driven consumers seek 80- to 100-point wines; they ignore 70's.</p>
        <p>I don't necessarily agree with Mr. Matthews's ratings. But Lenz's orchestration of semi-blind tastings of its wines against French blue chips and reliance on averaged numerical outcomes to trumpet a claim of parity invites a question: What weight should be given to an impartial, blind tasting like Mr. Matthews's?</p>
        <p>Last year, Lenz invited 10 people, seven of them food or wine professionals, to judge two of his sparkling wines against two Veuve Clicquots; two chardonnays against two white Burgundies, Joseph Drouhin's Marquis de Laguiche Montrachets; two cabernet sauvignons against two Chateau Latours; and two merlots against two Chateau Petruses.</p>
        <p>Notice that Lenz evidently chose the opposing wines. Notice, too, that most of the judges at the American Hotel in Sag Harbor -- home turf -- were in effect neighbors of Lenz.</p>
        <p>''Tasters were told exactly what wines were being poured in each flight but not which wine was in each glass,'' Peter Carroll, a Lenz owner, wrote later. Didn't this stage management -- implying a parity to prove existence of a parity -- invite the judges to flavor their deliberations with such extraneous issues as self-interest, etiquette and diplomacy?</p>
        <p>Voila! Lenz's '96 gold label chardonnay ($25) and the '96 Montrachet ($300) both scored 90 in Sag Harbor. Lenz's '95 merlot ($40) scored 92, and the '95 Petrus ($950) scored 93.</p>
        <p>''The tasting would appear to show, as other, similar tastings in New York, San Francisco, Long Island and Paris have shown over the last three years, that Lenz wines are as good as these ultra-premium French wines,'' Mr. Carroll wrote. ''Indeed, they are indistinguishable from them. Except for the price.''</p>
        <p>Indistinguishable? Then how come Mr. Matthews ranked the '96 Lenz chardonnay 12th among 13 chardonnays? And the '95 merlot 9th among 11 merlots?</p>
        <p>Established principles of criticism govern the Spectator's approach. The bottom-line tenet is: knowledge of what wines will be presented can affect judges' feelings and thoughts. Academic enologists and rigorous critics consider neutral tasting the surest sifter of quality in this iffy field.</p>
        <p>Yes, Lenz merlot can be superior. In youth, merlot-  and cabernet sauvignon-based wines can superficially resemble one another, as chardonnays can, before evolving into different selves. But given the characters, depths and developmental patterns of the Montrachets and Petruses, Lenz's exercise seems especially groundless.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carroll properly emphasizes price-value relationships. Since Mr. Matthews gives the $17 Pellegrini merlot 90 points and the $40 Lenz merlot 78 points, how should a shopper puzzling over a merchant's merlot rack apply Mr. Carroll's standard?</p>
        <p>The future of the otherwise impressive Lenz Winery -- and Lenz's true peers -- lies in what their wines uniquely are, and can aspire to, not in fruitless comparisons.</p>
