        <p>Edward Guiliano, provost and vice president for academic affairs for the past five years at the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, has been appointed president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>Dr. Guiliano, 50, replaces Matthew Schure, who is leaving after 30 years to be president of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine.</p>
        <p>Dr. Guiliano, whose appointment is effective this fall, said he hoped to promote the school more visibly than his predecessor did.</p>
        <p>The new president, who lives in New York City but was raised in Dix Hills, said he would step up efforts in Manhattan to develop more student internships and fund-raising opportunities. The school has a campus at Lincoln Center, but ''we've been much more of a player on Long Island, and I think that has to change,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Guiliano, who advocates greater use of technology in the classroom, said the school should capitalize on New York's position as a center of the global economy. Through Internet-based distance learning and other measures, he said, he wants to develop more programs with other countries, like the exchange of students and teachers that the school has with China.</p>
