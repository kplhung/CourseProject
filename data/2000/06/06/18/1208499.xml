        <p>The last Democrat standing between Virginia Republicans and a historic sweep of statewide power this year is Senator Charles S. Robb, once his state party's savior but unceremoniously rated ''toast'' and ''dead meat'' a year ago by political handicappers. The general Beltway prognosis was that Mr. Robb was the most vulnerable Democrat in the Senate in the 2000 elections.</p>
        <p>At the time, the senator trailed 12 points behind a formidable Republican challenger, former Gov. George F. Allen, prompting widespread speculation that Mr. Robb, laconic and moody as politicians go, might wisely retreat and call it a decent career after 12 years in the Senate.</p>
        <p>But to the surprise of Democrats as much as Republicans, that gap has now closed to a one-point tossup in the face of an unexpectedly galvanized Senator Robb. As a result, this commonwealth of Jeffersonian principles and tooth-and-claw politics is looking forward to a classic matchup: two former governors who led surges of state party dominance in the 80's and 90's will finally have it out before the electorate.</p>
        <p>''You don't want to go out and shoot up all your ammunition when you first hit the beach,'' explained Senator Robb, a Vietnam combat veteran with an unhurried air and a competitive gleam as he celebrates his recent political resurrection. ''I know there are a lot of folks who are very disappointed that I didn't roll over and play dead.''</p>
        <p>Not the least of them is Mr. Allen, a very popular, ebulliently combative politician with a substantial record as governor who has been campaigning across the state since 1998, strutting in his signature cowboy boots, reminding voters of his down-home style. Mr. Allen has been the campaign's nonstop leading fund-raiser, rallying Republicans to complete their state dominance by winning a second Senate seat to complement their sweep of a legislative majority and all three top executive positions in the last election.</p>
        <p>''Chuck, it's time to quit hiding behind parliamentary chicanery and paid attack dogs,'' boomed Mr. Allen, his love of political battling palpable, as he ignited the state party convention this month. ''Heck, I'll bet Hillary doesn't support Bill 87 percent of the time, but Virginia's junior senator surely does,'' Mr. Allen declared, burnishing his favorite sound-bite denunciation of the ''Clinton-Gore-Robb crowd.''</p>
        <p>In reply, Senator Robb relishes the choice voters will face between two such familiar, experienced politicians. ''This will be like Government 101, Civics 101,'' he said in an interview. He is hardly flinching at the contest, and his comeback in the polls is being attributed to nothing more complicated than his own striking display of re-election hunger.</p>
        <p>''Robb refused to engage in the race until he sensed it was time, and then he showed himself to be quite a counterpuncher,'' said Charlie Cook, National Journal's political handicapper, who had dubbed the senator ''dead meat'' last year. Mr. Cook has happily amended that in view of what is developing into the most interesting Senate contest outside New York. ''It's going to be a great race,'' said Mr. Cook, who still sees Mr. Allen as a slight front-runner.</p>
        <p>''It's very appropriate that these two candidates face off at the beginning of the 21st century,'' said Robert D. Holsworth, director of Virginia Commonwealth University's Center for Public Policy. ''As governors, they each helped define and solidify their parties at different times at the close of the 20th century as two sort of moderate conservatives.''</p>
        <p>After months of Democratic doubts about Senator Robb, he served notice at party rallies in March that he still had some fire. ''Let me assure you that no warrior I ever met at Quantico was frightened by big talk, big-heeled boots or a big chew of tobacco,'' said Mr. Robb, a former marine, targeting Mr. Allen's good-old-boy trappings. ''And neither am I.''</p>
        <p>The choice for voters begins with two distinct styles on the hustings. The 60-year-old Mr. Robb is reserved; the 48-year-old Mr. Allen is a buoyant campaigner, cherished by Republicans for his feisty one-liners.</p>
        <p>''Let's enjoy knocking their soft teeth down their whiny throats!'' was Mr. Allen's memorable call to battle five years ago. This year, he is scoring Senator Robb for ''sipping wine and nibbling cheese'' inside the Beltway, accusing him of being aloof from constituent responsibilities.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Allen's a very able campaigner, able to project himself as very self-confident,'' the senator said. ''That can either be a plus or a minus.'' His campaign aides more bluntly portray Mr. Allen as a polarizer -- in the words of one aide, ''Virginia's Al D'Amato.''</p>
        <p>But it is a very gentle Mr. Allen being seen these nights in an early blitz of television commercials blanketing the northern Virginia suburbs, a key battleground that Mr. Robb carried six years ago in narrowly defeating Oliver North in a three-man race. The simple biographical ads, devoid of a Republican label in this bastion of moderates and independents, have made Mr. Allen as ubiquitous as Bill Gates on the nighttime screen as he reintroduces himself to the booming Fairfax County area, where tens of thousands of newcomers have moved in the past six years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen is campaigning on his state record of cutting taxes and reducing crime, trimming state agencies and attracting new business. He promises federal measures in these areas and more, including a proposed $1,000 tax credit for parents to use for school computers and tutoring but not for private tuition. He criticizes Senator Robb as excessive in his proposals for stronger gun controls and his views on abortion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robb is emphasizing his Senate reputation as an expert on national security and a bipartisan conciliator, as well as his carefully blended record of fiscal conservatism and liberalism on social issues.</p>
        <p>With the campaign still in the feeling-out stage, Mr. Allen's early initiatives include repeated attacks on the senator's opposition to a constitutional ban on flag desecration and his defense of federal gasoline taxes. But Mr. Robb cheered Democrats with his counterpuncher's instinct. On the flag, he delivered an impassioned floor speech, speaking firsthand of battlefield death and patriotism for ''sacred intangibles'' more than ''a piece of cloth, however sacred.'' On the gasoline tax, he is focusing on the suburbs' main problem, commuter gridlock, emphasizing that fuel taxes pay for new roads.</p>
        <p>The senator also seized the initiative in a recent uproar over a state proclamation of Confederate History Month, a proclamation originated by Mr. Allen as governor. In an obvious attempt to rally their crucial African-American base, Democrats stress that Governor Allen's version, unlike the one eventually adopted, did not include the current condemnation of slavery -- a low-blow tactic, in the Republican's view.</p>
        <p>''That's negative politics to try to divide people on race,'' said Mr. Allen, the son of a famous football coach who uses gridiron metaphors the way Mr. Robb uses military terms. ''You have to research your opposition and realize what kind of game plans they run. What kind of crack-back blocks they run, how they hit out of bounds, how they'll twist your ankles after a tackle.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cook and other political observers question whether Mr. Robb can effectively demonize the Allen style, considering Mr. Allen's well-demonstrated popularity. Mr. Allen, delighted with the party unity that was absent six years ago, is attacking Mr. Robb's laid-back style.</p>
        <p>''I have no idea what motivates him to be in the Senate,'' Mr. Allen said, ''because he really doesn't do much, although every six years he becomes active and it's the first people see him outside the Beltway.''</p>
        <p>Senator Robb says his motivation is strong and increasingly clear to voters. ''Part of it is simply maturing in terms of how you look at the world,'' he said. ''Sometimes it takes a while to really figure out what you believe in to your core.''</p>
