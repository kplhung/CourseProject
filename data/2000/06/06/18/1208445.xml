        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mr. Kozol's comments about Morris High School were harsh and unfair. Morris is not ''adolescent storage space.'' Mr. Kozol asserted that a bright, promising 8-year-old girl's prospects are blighted by the likelihood that she will one day go to Morris. ''Her education,'' he wrote, ''will essentially come to its end the day she enrolls there.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mr. Kozol's comments about Morris High School were harsh and unfair. Morris is not ''adolescent storage space.'' Mr. Kozol asserted that a bright, promising 8-year-old girl's prospects are blighted by the likelihood that she will one day go to Morris. ''Her education,'' he wrote, ''will essentially come to its end the day she enrolls there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kozol has visited Morris High School and has seen that education is going on. As Mr. Kozol observed, education in our society is characterized by ''savage inequalities.'' At Morris High School, there are dedicated teachers and students working hard to overcome overwhelming handicaps that pervade the schools victimized by these inequalities. Some of these students have been working on our annual musical theater production in months of long rehearsals. Mr. Kozol and his readers are welcome to join us for our performances of ''Grease.'' After they see our students and the families in the audience that support them, it will be clear that their education did not end they day they arrived in Morris. Eight-year old Pineapple can go to Morris when she is ready for high school. There will still be failing students at that time, but Pineapple need not be among them. She can get a good education at Morris, and find a place among peers who are doing likewise.</p>
