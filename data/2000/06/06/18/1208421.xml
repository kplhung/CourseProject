        <p>Last week, Matthew Rabin, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley, received a $500,000 MacArthur Foundation grant for his studies of such phenomena as people's failure to do today what they can put off until tomorrow.</p>
        <p>How's that? ''It is partly self-help,'' Professor Rabin, 36, acknowledged. ''I am a severe procrastinator.'' His work involves applying psychological insights about inertia (as in sticking with poor investments), procrastination and so forth to explain behavior that most economists simply regard as irrational.</p>
        <p>So how is his own self-help plan going? ''It's a complete failure,'' he said, laughing. ''I'm famous for leaving all my money in a checking account,'' earning a quarter-percent interest.</p>
        <p>Fellow economists -- ''a very smart, money-savvy group of people'' -- often treat him as a therapist. ''I've gotten a lot of confessions out of them about their failure to manage their money better,'' he said, ''though they almost always blame it on a spouse.''</p>
