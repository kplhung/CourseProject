        <p>Finding a clean, safe beach nowadays can seem as difficult as finding that set of car keys you dropped in the sand. But the Clean Beaches Council, a nonprofit organization established in 1998, is trying to ease beachgoers' worries with its Blue Wave Campaign, which certifies environmental cleanliness and public safety along the shore.</p>
        <p>This summer, the council has certified 30 beaches in 7 states as meeting its criteria for water quality, cleanliness, public safety, habitat conservation and erosion management. The organization works with state and local environmental authorities to verify each beach's compliance.</p>
        <p>In New York, Sunken Forest Beach and Watch Hill Beach, both part of Fire Island National Seashore, have been certified. In New Jersey, the three certified sections are all part of Sandy Hook National Seashore: North Beach, North Gunnison Beach and Lot Beaches B-E.</p>
        <p>Other states with certified beaches are Delaware (with nine), California (Cabrillo Beach oceanside at San Pedro), Florida (five on the Atlantic and eight on the Gulf Coast), Maryland (North Ocean Beach, Assateague Island National Seashore) and Virginia (Tom's Cove Beach, Assateague Island). The complete list can be found at www.cleanbeaches.org.</p>
        <p>Walter McLeod, president of the Clean Beaches Council, said that Blue Wave beaches must meet federal Environmental Protection Agency standards for water cleanliness. ''Less than a quarter of beaches in the United States use those standards,'' Mr. McLeod said. Water quality will be monitored at certified beaches, he said, and if they no longer meet E.P.A. standards, the Blue Wave flag that designates the council's certification must be taken down.</p>
        <p>The program is voluntary, and is meant more as a carrot than a stick, since the council does not compile a list of beaches considered unsafe.</p>
        <p>Certification is good for one year. The council receives funds from the E.P.A. and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration.</p>
