        <p>K-Rock radio's annual K-Rock Dysfunctional Family Picnic is set to open at PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmel, NJ, and will feature hard rock, punk and metal bands (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The K-Rock Dysfunctional Family Picnic is not a Jerry Springer day in the park. Sponsored by K-Rock radio (92.3 FM), this annual event is louder, more aggressive and, depending on taste, perhaps more musical. A hard-core Woodstock, the concert brings together some of the best hard rock, punk and metal bands in an ear-splitting, mosh-pit-filled day of fun.</p>
        <p>One highlight is the Stone Temple Pilots (a homecoming for the New Jersey natives Dean and Robert DeLeo). The band's muscular guitarwork, clockwork rhythm section and big gloomy voice of Scott Weiland, who recently was released from prison (he was convicted on drug charges) have defined the post-grunge sound.</p>

        <p>Limp Bizkit attracts fans from pre-teens to 20-somethings with their Uzi-styled defiance. Their caustic rage, assimilated with punk, hard core and hip-hop create a mix that the Korn generation can not resist.</p>
        <p>And the pounding continues with the complex Creed, who mix Pearl Jam-like heavy-guitar riffs with spiritual lyrics.</p>
        <p>Don't be surprised if mom and dad decline this family get-together, 2 p.m. Friday at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel. (732) 335-0400.</p>
