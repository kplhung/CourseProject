        <p>Chartwell House, a new 34-story limestone and red-brick condominium with many studio and one-bedroom apartments, is soon to rise at 1760 Second Avenue, between 91st and 92nd Streets. Completion is scheduled for summer 2001.</p>
        <p>''We're targeting affluent singles and professional couples just starting out,'' said Richard L. Fisher, a partner at Fisher Brothers, which is developing the 154-unit condo with Capital Real Estate Ltd.</p>
        <p>The building, across from Ruppert and Yorkville Towers, is to offer 22 studios, 79 one-bedrooms, 43 two-bedrooms and 10 three-bedrooms, including a penthouse. Its foundation, now being poured, occupies the site of three demolished tenements. The project cost was not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisher, who has an affinity for Sir Winston Churchill that began in college, named the condominium for the Churchill family house in England. (The name is also shared with another of Mr. Fisher's businesses, Chartwell Booksellers, which specializes in Churchilliana, in Park Avenue Plaza, on 52nd Street between Madison and Park Avenues.) The Second Avenue project was inspired in part, Mr. Fisher said, after he tried helping his 27-year-old son, Winston, named for the statesman, look for a one-bedroom apartment to buy last fall.</p>
        <p>''There was nothing in this price point,'' said Winston Fisher, who ended up renting an apartment in the area and recently joined the Fisher firm, where he is helping develop Chartwell House.</p>
        <p>Moshe Dan Azogui, executive vice president of Capital Real Estate, said that annual rents on the Upper East Side have gone above $50 a square foot. For instance, he said, a 500-square-foot studio would rent for more than $2,000 a month.</p>
        <p>Prices at the condo are expected to range from $295,000 to $330,000 for 438-to-750-square-foot studios; $380,000 to $710,000 for 700-to-912-square-foot one-bedrooms; and $550,000 to more than $1 million for 1,115-to-1,500-square-foot two-bedrooms.</p>
        <p>Three-bedrooms are to range from $1.15 million for a 1,680-square-foot space to more than $2 million for a 2,416-square-foot penthouse with two terraces and a fireplace.</p>
        <p>H. Thomas O'Hara, whose firm designed the project, said that one-bedrooms and studios would often be adjacent, so they could easily be combined.</p>
        <p>All apartments will have access to high-speed Internet and direct satellite service. Kitchens are to feature Frigidaire stainless steel appliances and granite countertops.</p>
        <p>Residents will be able to relax on a roof deck offering river views, or keep an eye on children in a playroom through windows of adjoining laundry and exercise areas on the third floor.</p>
        <p>''Light will filter into the lobby designed as an intimate jewel box,'' Mr. O'Hara said. ''We've designed a limestone floor to go with the mahogany paneling.''</p>
        <p>Sales are expected to begin later this month. The exclusive sales agent is Adrienne Albert of Marketing Directors Inc.</p>
