        <p>Editorial finds economic prosperity and federal budget surpluses are testing creativity of both Vice Pres Gore and Republican presidential rival George W Bush</p>

        <p>A deadly familiarity has crept into the debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. Last week, as Mr. Gore embarked on a new series of ''prosperity and progress'' speeches, Mr. Bush immediately derided his efforts as ''Al Gore's 'I Invented Prosperity' Tour.'' Underneath the surface of such exchanges, however, the political terrain may be undergoing some redefinition. For the first time in decades, a presidential race is occurring at a time of economic abundance and budget surpluses. These unusual circumstances are testing the creativity of both major candidates.</p>
        <p>Seven years ago, hemmed in by massive budget deficits inherited from the Reagan years, President Clinton could not deliver on his promises to stimulate the economy with major investments in infrastructure and other programs. But suddenly the candidates are now arguing over what to do with surpluses that no candidates in recent history have enjoyed. This has allowed Mr. Gore, who has been stumbling for months, to present the public with a detailed policy agenda of spending proposals. It has also allowed Mr. Bush to warn -- echoing the traditional anti-government rhetoric of Republican candidates -- that the money must not be commandeered by federal programs.</p>
        <p>Their sparring is driven by new but as yet unannounced budget projections for the next 10 years. A 10-year surplus that in April was projected by the Congressional Budget Office to be nearly $900 billion if spending remained at realistic levels could now turn out to be between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion. The surplus is based on prudent economic assumptions, but it could of course shrink if there was an economic downturn, or if Republicans managed to ram through a lot of their proposed tax cuts for the rich this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore proposes to use the extra money for an accelerated program to retire the national debt and to set up three ''trust funds'' for health care, the environment and education. He argues that his approach is more fiscally prudent than Mr. Bush's, especially because it aims to make America debt-free for the first time since the 1830's. For its part, the Bush campaign will argue that its tax cut of more than $1 trillion over 10 years is now more affordable than before, and that spending the surplus is a decision best left to individuals.</p>
        <p>Both campaigns seem aware of surveys showing that Americans are not nearly as angry about the government as they were in the early or even the mid-1990's. The Gore campaign is tapping into an emerging American recognition that economic change has made it more urgent for government to train workers, invest in health and research, and protect families left behind or hurt by new rules in the workplace and marketplace.</p>
        <p>The presidential contest has not caught fire with the voters quite yet. Two men of privilege approaching the White House with a sense of entitlement does little to fire the imagination. But if they  can make this campaign a genuine discussion of the opportunities posed by abundance, it could mark a turning point. The first glimmerings of such a debate should be encouraged rather than dismissed.</p>
