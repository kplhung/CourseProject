        <p>MANY years ago, when they first started talking about 500 channels of cable television, the idea seemed to be about bringing the wonders of the world into every living room -- news from Argentina! British rugby and soccer! Nobel laureates opining on abstruse topics of great sociological import! Television was going to be transformed from the vast wasteland to an electronic Eden.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, most of the eccentric, offbeat stuff -- to the extent it exists -- has migrated to the Web, and cable has mostly ushered in a torrent of babe shows, screaming heads hollering about the Clintons and pitch-o-ramas hawking exercise equipment. And instead of the world, cable more and more seems to be about the neighborhood -- Ossining vs. Somers girls volleyball, thrilling zoning board and school board meetings, obscure authors addressing the local P.T.A.</p>

        <p>MANY years ago, when they first started talking about 500 channels of cable television, the idea seemed to be about bringing the wonders of the world into every living room -- news from Argentina! British rugby and soccer! Nobel laureates opining on abstruse topics of great sociological import! Television was going to be transformed from the vast wasteland to an electronic Eden.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, most of the eccentric, offbeat stuff -- to the extent it exists -- has migrated to the Web, and cable has mostly ushered in a torrent of babe shows, screaming heads hollering about the Clintons and pitch-o-ramas hawking exercise equipment. And instead of the world, cable more and more seems to be about the neighborhood -- Ossining vs. Somers girls volleyball, thrilling zoning board and school board meetings, obscure authors addressing the local P.T.A.</p>
        <p>Nothing wrong with that. Getting local news and my daughter's fourth-grade school play via cable is fine with me. The trouble -- let's be honest -- is that Westchester isn't exactly a hotbed of stunning news and polarizing local personalities.</p>
        <p>There are, of course, all sorts of high-powered folks lurking around every well-trimmed hedge across our fair county -- movie stars in Bedford, great literateurs in Pelham, mighty Knicks in Larchmont, a President and First Lady in Chappaqua, titans of finance everywhere you look. But they're famous for what they do elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The truth is almost no one is famous for what they do in Westchester. We don't have celebrated county politicians, or athletes known for their feats with the Yonkers Bonkers, Rye Bread or Pace University whatevers-they-are.</p>
        <p>In fact, all we've really got are Al, Anthony and Jeanine, the stars of the long-running Pirro Family follies, now winding up in the federal courthouse in White Plains. The trial has been first-rate theater, but it's of particular interest because for county news, they're pretty much all we've got.</p>
        <p>So, to make the most of what we have, efforts are said to be afoot, to launch PNN, the Pirro News Network, offering all Pirro all the time. The following, I'm told, is the tentative first-week lineup, subject to trial developments, tax law changes and political cross-currents. Live courthouse coverage leading to the verdict will be aired on PNN2.</p>
        <p>6 a.m. Morning prayers. Keep your fingers crossed.</p>
        <p>7 a.m. Power Aerobics with Jeanine: The D.A. shows how to write a legal brief, balance the family checkbook and max out the Stairmaster at the same time.</p>

        <p>9 a.m. Movies With a Message: ''On the Waterfront:'' Two brothers confront the meaning of loyalty and greed.</p>
        <p>11:30 a.m. Tax Law for Dummies: Anthony Pirro shows how to deduct those pesky child-care and home-decorating expenses.</p>
        <p>12:30 a.m. You Can Call Me Al: Albert Pirro takes calls on real estate matters.</p>
        <p>1:30p.m. Family Feud: Game show. Sort of.</p>
        <p>2:30 All My Children: Jessica flies across the Atlantic to confront her former lover but is arrested by customs officials.</p>
        <p>3:30 p.m. Girl Talk: Special episode! Hillary Clinton and Donna Hanover join Jeanine Pirro in a lighthearted chat about their wacky spouses and the things we do for love.</p>

        <p>9 p.m. Home Improvement: Where to find that $13,000 Chinese rug and how to determine whether it's tax deductible.</p>
        <p>10 p.m. Biography: Leona Helmsley. Lavish spending and illegal tax deductions trip up high-profile dynamo.</p>
        <p>11 p.m. Trial Highlights: Court TV analysts pick over trial highlights.</p>
