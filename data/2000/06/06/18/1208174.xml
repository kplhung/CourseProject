        <p>LONG BRANCH is one of those shore towns, like Atlantic City and Asbury Park, that are all too well known for having seen better days. A fabulous resort in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, visited by no fewer than seven presidents, it faded fast after World War II and in recent years has struggled to keep breathing.</p>
        <p>But Long Branch has seen worse days too, and while reminders of its Gilded Age glory may be hard to find, signs of life abound. Immigrants from Brazil and Portugal are moving in, forming one of the state's largest Portuguese-speaking neighborhoods. Seven Presidents Oceanfront Park, a wide, shimmering and beautifully maintained white-sand beach just north of the old boardwalk, is paved with people on summer weekends. And now, on a stretch of Broadway in the solid working-class district called Uptown, there's a nascent restaurant scene.</p>

        <p>LONG BRANCH is one of those shore towns, like Atlantic City and Asbury Park, that are all too well known for having seen better days. A fabulous resort in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, visited by no fewer than seven presidents, it faded fast after World War II and in recent years has struggled to keep breathing.</p>
        <p>But Long Branch has seen worse days too, and while reminders of its Gilded Age glory may be hard to find, signs of life abound. Immigrants from Brazil and Portugal are moving in, forming one of the state's largest Portuguese-speaking neighborhoods. Seven Presidents Oceanfront Park, a wide, shimmering and beautifully maintained white-sand beach just north of the old boardwalk, is paved with people on summer weekends. And now, on a stretch of Broadway in the solid working-class district called Uptown, there's a nascent restaurant scene.</p>
        <p>First came Joe &amp; Maggie's Bistro, which serves new American food and has attracted a fanatically devoted following. (I have yet to eat there.) Now, just a few doors up the street, there is Uptown, named for the neighborhood. Open since April in a stunningly refurbished space that for decades held a bar and liquor store, this elegant little restaurant is drawing very uptown crowds even before the inevitable summer onslaught.</p>
        <p>It is easy to miss. From Broadway, its nominal address, it looks like the kind of office that would rather not advertise its business -- a clinic or collection agency, perhaps. The main entrance is on the other side, from the parking lot around back, and the effect of this turnabout is pleasingly disorienting: in some indefinable way they've got you hooked before you sit down.</p>
        <p>You descend through a cavernous but vibrant bar into the main dining room, which looks out on Broadway through film-noir venetian blinds. The walls are hung with little Moderne lamps and black-and-white photographs that turn out, on close examination, to be snapshots of patrons of the old Cammarano's Bar.</p>
        <p>The Cammarano family still owns the place, but has turned over management to a pair of young New Yorkers: Michael Bienz, 33 (whose sister, Theresa, was one of the designers), and the chef, Sam Nativo, 34. Mr. Bienz (pronounced benz), tall and outgoing, has the title of bar manager, and he has serious fun with it. He claims to know 150 martini recipes and provides a separate martini menu, with items like Pink Prozac (orange vodka, orange liqueur, Cointreau, grapefruit juice, cranberry juice), the Uptown (white and red grapes steeped in vodka, plus Champagne) and . . . you get the idea.</p>
        <p>A little of this goes a long way with me, and I hope nobody is driving after knocking back three or four of these babies. Still, Uptown is attracting the kind of crowd the new management is after. On the Sunday night of Memorial Day weekend, it was packed to the gunwales with sleek, black-clad 30-somethings from Monmouth County's pricey outer suburbs, enjoying themselves so conspicuously and so loudly that they could have drowned out a Springsteen concert in the next town.</p>
        <p>Things were quieter the following Sunday night, and the meal was more pleasant over all -- though there were glitches each night in the friendly and accommodating service. (On the second visit, we were billed for a flight of martinis we hadn't ordered.) The good news is that the quality of the food was consistently high.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nativo is straight out of Brooklyn -- grew up in Bensonhurst, still lives there -- and his first kitchen was a pizzeria on Staten Island. While his dishes are full of contemporary touches, they are grounded in the traditional Southern Italian style he learned from his mother and grandmother.</p>
        <p>Every table gets a small loaf of hot and crusty Italian bread from Golden Crust, a Long Branch bakery. It works hand in hand with a typically generous appetizer, in which at least three dozen tiny Prince Edward Island mussels are steamed in white wine, broth and herbs -- simple food that goes straight to the pleasure sensors. So does a dense lobster bisque whose heartiness makes you overlook its silken refinement, and a lovely salad in which nothing dominates but everything stands out: crunchy young spears of asparagus, shavings of earthy grana cheese, tangy mizuna greens.</p>
        <p>In an homage to his first restaurant, Mr. Nativo offers terrific thin-crusted pizzas that you might share, as an appetizer, or hoard for yourself, as a main course. We enjoyed one with roasted eggplant and another with mozzarella and chopped tomatoes, but fought over the Nonna (that's Italian for grandma) -- roast sausage, goat cheese, mozzarella and crushed red pepper. This is fun food, bar food, but so well made that you have to take it seriously.</p>
        <p>The list of main courses is short but appealing. The veal chop, at $24 the most expensive item on the menu, is one well-chosen piece of meat: tender, accurately grilled and well served by the accompanying porcini mushrooms, mashed potatoes and tomato-and-arugula salad. Pan-roasted halibut, flaky and mild, comes with sweet braised fennel in a rosemary-orange sauce that needed to be reduced just a minute longer. And it's a long, hot summer, but I'll be surprised if it brings me better fish than Uptown's grouper, a thick fillet that stands up well to Mr. Nativo's mother's Sicilian caponata.</p>
        <p>Cod, a special one night, was not so successful -- lifeless in a cornmeal crust, atop a soggy blue-corn taco. But another special, tuna, looked and tasted sensational, with purple mashed potatoes, spinach and a beet reduction. The strip steak was decent, but its haystack fries congealed into a dense and unappetizing tangle as they cooled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nativo makes a chocolate bread pudding that is hard to stop eating, for all the calories it is costing you. (The name Godiva figures at least twice in the list of ingredients.) While he calls his tiramisu ''traditional,'' it looks anything but, coming as it does in a martini glass; in fact it does have all the traditional components -- mascarpone cream, ladyfingers soaked in espresso -- and it works just fine.</p>
        <p>Far less traditional, far lighter and just as satisfying is a mint-and-mango soup, also served in a martini glass, with a ball of raspberry sorbet. It's a fitting way to end a meal here: a real find, as elegant and unexpected as the restaurant itself.</p>
