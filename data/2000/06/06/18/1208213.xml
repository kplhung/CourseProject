        <p>THE Antiquarian and Landmarks Society of Hartford was not at all surprised a decade ago when it acquired a beautifully preserved 18th-century estate in northwestern Connecticut.

        <p>THE Antiquarian and Landmarks Society of Hartford was not at all surprised a decade ago when it acquired a beautifully preserved 18th-century estate in northwestern Connecticut. The Bethlehem summer home for a wealthy New York family, it was called ''The Hay'' by its last mistress, Caroline Woolsey Ferriday, who had made her intended bequest well known before she died in 1990.</p>
        <p>What the Connecticut preservation group was not as prepared for was the responsibility of Miss Ferriday's formal, family garden, started more than three-quarters of a century earlier by her mother, Eliza Mitchell Ferriday. Along with the orchard, trees, shrubs and the yew parterre hedges outlining the beds of perennials, the Ferriday women had tenderly raised fragrant French roses, some with lineages traced to the 1500's, many different species of lilac forming an allee and a profusion of peonies.</p>
        <p>The society could have downplayed the garden, which was overgrown, and concentrated on fixing up the house, but the garden held so much promise and it was obvious that it was once lovingly cared for.</p>
        <p>''I walked through this breezeway and I came upon this incredibly mature apple orchard on this foggy, misty, gray day and I was just captivated,'' said Robin Zitter of Sherman, a professional horticulturist who was hired to direct the garden restoration. ''And then I walked the landscape and it felt so romantic. It felt like the women had really left something very, very special and very personal.''</p>
        <p>So the society began to orchestrate the reconstruction of the circa 1915 formal garden, a project that has been under way for 10 years and has cost more than $250,000. It is now open to the public and drawing strong reviews.</p>
        <p>''Nineteen-twenties gardens aren't so rare, but well-restored and well-managed gardens are rare and that's one of the things that really distinguishes Bellamy-Ferriday,'' said William Noble, director of preservation projects for the Garden Conservancy of Cold Spring, N.Y., which described the garden as ''perhaps the sole surviving estate garden in Northwestern Connecticut.''</p>
        <p>Garden restoration is not as obscure as it was only 10 years ago. Across the country, gardens are being preserved in towns, and even cities, for public and private enjoyment. A national organization founded in 1989, the conservancy, has consulted on the preservation of about 150 gardens nationwide, including the Beatrix Farrand Garden at Bellefield, Hyde Park, N.Y. (part of the Roosevelt-Vanderbilt National Historic Site); Historic Morven, Princeton, N.J., once belonging to a signer of the Declaration of Independence; and McKee Botanical Garden, Vero Beach, Fla. In the early and mid-1990's, the Bellamy-Ferriday garden was one of its projects.</p>
        <p>Yet, how does an organization recreate something as fragile and ephemeral as a garden? Only a matter of decades ago, there was little science to support this kind of restoration, according to the author and landscape architect Rudy Favretti, professor emeritus at the University of Connecticut and consultant on such sites as Thomas Jefferson's grove and garden at Monticello.</p>
        <p>''The whole concept of actually restoring landscapes the way we do them today, of really delving into the archives and finding written comments about the gardens and photographic records or paintings or engravings and doing site archaeology that's a relatively recent thing,'' Professor Favretti said. ''For example,'' he said, ''we began to rely less on hearsay and more on research. A lot of the early restorations were done like: 'Oh, let's put an herb garden in because it's old.' Actually very few herb gardens as we see them today existed. The little enclosed space right outside the doorway devoted to herbs is a modern conception.''</p>
        <p>Today, in addition to family archives and memories, Professor Favretti said garden reconstruction sometimes relies on tools like infrared photography to detect organic material underground and sonar to locate buried paths and walls. To maintain a restored garden the level of exactitude has reached such heights that living plants are ''cloned'' so that identical genetic replacements can be groomed.</p>
        <p>In Bethlehem, efforts were made right away to document what was growing in the newly acquired garden -- first by taking pictures and studying them.</p>
        <p>Questions arose: ''Is that a weed? Is that a volunteer?'' After two years of assessing and planning, the Antiquarian and Landmarks Society hired Ms. Zitter.</p>
        <p>On a drizzly March day in 1992, Ms. Zitter arrived for the first time at what is known as the Bellamy-Ferriday House and Garden to see the garden she would be rehabilitating.</p>
        <p>''When I came, the place was pretty neglected because Miss Ferriday was ill during the last years of her life and didn't get out much,'' she said. ''And one of the big questions is how many of the decisions made in the last years of the garden were hers and how many were the decisions of the people working in the garden. The most difficult thing for me working here is never having met Caroline Ferriday.''</p>
        <p>Miss Ferriday came from a wealthy family. Her father, Henry McKeen Ferriday, was in the dry goods business in New York City. Her mother came from a family of judges and lawyers and was related to the Woolsey family, who have their name on Woolsey Hall at Yale University. Miss Ferriday was an actress in the 1920's and part of the 30's, appearing in plays in New York and later became an active philanthropist.</p>
        <p>Barbara Bradbury Pape, the site director, and Arleen Mitchell, part-time archivist, contributed their findings to the garden restoration. Ms. Mitchell is always on the lookout for garden pictures and diagrams as she sorts through papers, collating letters and diaries dating back to the 1700's when the Rev. Joseph Bellamy settled the site to become the Congregational pastor of the First Church of Bethlehem.</p>
        <p>Anecdotes were collected from Miss Ferriday's surviving friends and relatives who visited the site after her death to walk through the garden and talk about their recollections of what grew where and in what abundance. Stumps and depressions confirmed the earlier presence of trees and bushes no longer there. But memories don't always lead to solid evidence. A couple of acquaintances recollected that Caroline Ferriday's give-away beds (where flowers were cut to give away to friends) belonged where there is now a group of lilacs. ''So we keep searching for photographs and talking to people to find out what is correct,'' Ms. Zitter said. ''We don't have any documentation that these were her give-away beds.''</p>
        <p>While the reconstruction of records would go on for years, it was the salvaging of depleted plants that had to be tended to most urgently.</p>
        <p>''We started full tilt on trying to rejuvenate the plants that were here so we wouldn't lose anything else and that meant incredible soil amending, fertilization, pruning,'' Ms. Zitter said. ''There were roses that had just run through the entire garden, yet because of this project I couldn't just rip out and compost the ones I didn't want. I had to make sure they weren't something special or something we didn't already have.</p>
        <p>''So everything I took out that was making things too crowded I had to transplant to other areas and rejuvenate to the point, the roses for instance, they would bloom so I could identify them. We have a working nursery/propagation area that we use for that.''</p>
        <p>Early one morning, when the roses were blooming, Ms. Zitter cut two cooler chests full of roses and drove to New Hampshire where a rose expert in Nashua helped identify most of them.</p>
        <p>Some of the plants were cultivated in the 1950's, but date from roses first grown in the 1500's. ''That's what Caroline Ferriday loved, just the history and having roses that she knew were grown at the garden of Malmaison,'' the home of Napoleon and his wife, Josephine, who was a renown collector of roses, said Ms. Zitter. Since she spent summers in France for most of her life, Miss Ferriday brought back ideas and cuttings from plants she found there, including possibly some small lilacs still growing there.</p>
        <p>Her devotion to the garden once prompted Miss Ferriday to admit, ''In the midst of the delights of Paris, I would stop to wonder if the rose bugs were under control, or how the new regale lilies were doing.''</p>
        <p>In the early stages of garden's rehabilitation, the peonies were also admitted to the nursery -- victims of bad drainage and bad soil. ''We had the soil excavated out, had drainage put down in the bottom and then brought in all new soil and replanted the peonies,'' said Ms. Zitter, who admitted this presented an unusual situation.</p>
        <p>''Part of me thought if the site is poorly drained why are we changing the site to suit the plant,'' she said. ''Really, my whole philosophy is to plant plants that suit the site. But because of the nature of this project and because that's where she had the peony beds, we were going to try anyway to see if we could recreate that.''</p>
        <p>Most of the flowers were easy to identify from a map Miss Ferriday had left. For verification and to identify those that weren't named, Ms. Zitter sent photographs and some buds in water tubes to a well-known peony grower in the Midwest. Even he couldn't identify one of them. ''So we have one that is just called 'Annie's Pinky Red','' Ms. Zitter said. ''That's what Caroline Ferriday called it.''</p>
        <p>In other notes she left, Caroline Ferriday identified the ancestry of a weeping willow in the orchard. The tree came from a cutting of a willow growing on the Isle of Elba where Napoleon lived in exile.</p>
        <p>Though not all of the plants found here are known to have such an exalted parentage, the preservation of their genetic makeup is an essential part of restoring a garden on this level. Consider what the stewards of Caroline Ferriday's garden did when an ancient apple tree died.</p>
        <p>''As our apple orchard started to deteriorate when the first tree went down, I realized that I better get going,'' said Ms. Zitter. Buying a young apple tree from the garden shop just wouldn't do it. ''It wouldn't be of the same genetic makeup,'' she said. ''What we want to do is to try to keep the genetic makeup as much as we can of each plant that's here.''</p>
        <p>A grafting expert was hired to graft each apple tree onto root stock. Each carefully labeled growing clone is tended in the nursery until it is needed to replace the exact tree it came from.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zitter produced a plant inventory that involved locating all the plants on a map, cataloging their history, condition, size and then integrating this information with a maintenance record.</p>
        <p>This is called an accession. ''This is important for us because every time we do something to the plant it is recorded as part of its history,'' she said. ''Because I'm not going to be here forever.''</p>
        <p>But Caroline Ferriday, in a sense, will be.</p>
