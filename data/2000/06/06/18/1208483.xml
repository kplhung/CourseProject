        <p>On Friday, in a stiff southwesterly breeze over Rhode Island Sound, 175 yachts answered the starting guns to begin the 42nd running of the Newport-Bermuda Race. Among the boats competing for top prizes were such modern thoroughbreds as Larry Ellison's Sayonara, Jim Dolan's Sagamore and George Coumantaros's Boomerang.</p>
        <p>With a forecast of high pressure and light winds in the waters off Bermuda, the prospect of a relatively easy but slow contest -- particularly for the smaller yachts -- appeared likely. But one of the boats competing in this year's classic division, though not a threat to the large, light front-runners, had already tasted glory in a heavy-air edition of the race more than six decades ago.</p>

        <p>On Friday, in a stiff southwesterly breeze over Rhode Island Sound, 175 yachts answered the starting guns to begin the 42nd running of the Newport-Bermuda Race. Among the boats competing for top prizes were such modern thoroughbreds as Larry Ellison's Sayonara, Jim Dolan's Sagamore and George Coumantaros's Boomerang.</p>
        <p>With a forecast of high pressure and light winds in the waters off Bermuda, the prospect of a relatively easy but slow contest -- particularly for the smaller yachts -- appeared likely. But one of the boats competing in this year's classic division, though not a threat to the large, light front-runners, had already tasted glory in a heavy-air edition of the race more than six decades ago.</p>
        <p>In 1936, in gusts of over 40 knots, the newly launched 53-foot cutter Kirawan won the 635-mile biennial ocean race. Built in Brooklyn for Robert P. Baruch, a member of the Manhasset Bay Yacht Club, Kirawan launched the prestigious career of the yacht designer Philip Rhodes.</p>
        <p>Kirawan eventually moved to California, and in 1993 the film producer Sandy Horowitz purchased her and began an extensive refit under the direction of Tom Adams, a sailor and woodworker. ''I gave Tom carte blanche to do the work, and he took this on heart and soul,'' Horowitz said. ''Some people see boats as inanimate objects but this one has a life of its own.''</p>
        <p>Now, with a rebuilt interior, hand-cut marble counters and even a rolltop desk, Kirawan is a work of art. And with a seasoned seven-man crew that includes John Rousmaniere, the yachting writer, and John Jourdane, the former Whitbread racer, Kirawan may also have some surprises for the upstarts. ''The nice thing is that she really powers through a swell when those modern race boats are pounding,'' Adams said. ''It's a pretty comfortable ride.''</p>
        <p>Joyon Sails in Record Time</p>
        <p>As they head south, some of the sailors in the Bermuda Race may encounter the leading Open 60 monohulls en route to Newport to complete the Europe 1 New Man singlehanded trans-Atlantic race, which started two weeks ago from Plymouth, England. The first finishers, in what has been a wild affair, are due to arrive some time today.</p>
        <p>Sailing a 60-foot trimaran called Eure et Loir, the 44-year-old Frenchman Francis Joyon last Wednesday won the multihull class in record-setting style with a time of 9 days and 23 hours 21 minutes, slicing nearly 10 hours off the mark set in 1988. The rugged Joyon won with an old boat, small mast, tired sails and no sponsor.</p>
        <p>The story in the monohull class is no less intriguing. At or near the front of the pack is the 23-year-old English sailor Ellen MacArthur aboard Kingfisher, who took over the lead a week ago and has been holding off the challenges of her countryman Mike Golding and the French sailors Roland Jourdain and Catherine Chabaud. Italy's Giovanni Soldini was also within striking distance.</p>
        <p>Nineteen Open 60's started the race but, after three boats were dismasted, it became an early war of attrition. MacArthur set a frenetic pace and exhibited almost flawless tactics while weaving a course through challenging weather systems.</p>
        <p>But she has not had an easy passage. Last week she fell through a hatch and said, via e-mail: ''Terrible, terrible, terrible night. Whacked my head and I think broke my finger.'' Later, her progress came to a stunning halt when she collided with a whale. ''I'm not sure what I'm more concerned about, the boat or the whale,'' she reported, adding that the leviathan was probably killed in the collision.</p>
        <p>Clearly, it will take more than a giant sea creature to stop Ellen MacArthur.</p>
        <p>A Record Atlantic Crossing</p>
        <p>On the Bahamian island of San Salvador, New Zealand's Grant Dalton and his crew aboard the 110-foot catamaran Club Med today are also due to put the closing touches on a triumphant trans-Atlantic crossing that started in Cadiz, Spain. The Club Med team will almost certainly break the record for an east-to-west Atlantic voyage. More importantly, with a 24-hour run of 625.7 miles last weekend -- an average speed of over 26 knots -- they also smashed the record of 580 miles set by Steve Fossett's PlayStation.</p>
        <p>''For the first couple of hours we had a confused sea and we weren't really going that fast,'' Dalton said last week via satellite phone. ''When we thought we had a chance at the record our intention was just to get one mile more than Fossett had got. But when we did that with two hours to spare, we just kept pushing through.''</p>
        <p>Dalton and Fossett are both using trans-Atlantic training runs as a tune-up for The Race, the round-the-world event that begins from Barcelona, Spain, on Dec. 31. ''We got a note from Fossett saying he thought that 600 was possible but he was surprised to see someone get through to 625,'' Dalton said. ''My feeling is that he's pretty wily and he'll be itching to break our record.''</p>
        <p>Ideally, Dalton would like to race Fossett back across the Atlantic, from New York to England, later this summer.</p>
        <p>''We'll go on standby in the middle of July,'' Dalton said. ''If we're able to make an arrangement with PlayStation that would be fantastic. It would be a really good showdown.''</p>
