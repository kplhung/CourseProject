        <p>Bill Lenderking, a big old guy, 6 feet 4 inches tall, 66 years old, sits on his big old porch, stretching out his knobby old legs, sipping a beer. Finally, he says: ''It's not like it's some real adventure. I'm not risking my life.''</p>
        <p>He'll find out what he's risking along the way. The plan-in-progress is for Lenderking and three younger old guys to row their boats from the South Street Seaport in Lower Manhattan to Shelter Island, where he rowed as a kid. He has hardly rowed since. This is about a 120-mile pull, four or five days through the treacherous currents of Hell Gate, over the June millpond of Long Island Sound along the North Shore, around the tip of Orient Point, into the ferocious tides of Plum Gut and then the sheltered waters between the Forks.</p>
        <p>''We'll be rowing with the tide,'' he says.</p>
        <p>''It's hardly 'Deliverance,' '' snorts his wife, Susan.</p>
        <p>''I've always wanted to take a calculated risk,'' he says. ''What's the worst that could happen? That I can't handle it, that I can't keep up? This isn't crazy, it's not Everest.''</p>
        <p>But there was Annapurna, 23 years ago, when Lenderking wandered away from the group and fell down the mountain. He walked five days back from base camp with several broken ribs. He was then in the Foreign Service, posted to Thailand. He also served in Cuba, Bolivia and Vietnam, where he cheerfully admits, with his ruddy, blue-eyed confidence, that he was one of the ''propagandists'' selling the pacification program. The government pensioned him off five years ago.</p>
        <p>''I guess age has something to do with all this,'' admits Lenderking. ''After I retired at 61, I thought I'd have no trouble getting work. I had a lot of experience. But I could see interviewers' eyes just glaze over. Even if I had had technical skills, which I don't, these Internet start-ups wouldn't be interested in me.''</p>
        <p>He has struggled to chart a new course. He says he has made wrong turns. He qualified to be a stockbroker, but didn't like it. He finished a novel, which he describes as a psychological thriller about a Foreign Service officer, but hasn't sold it. He has done some consulting, and established an on-line business selling modern first-edition books, which has accumulated more pleasure than money.</p>
        <p>Lenderking is not quite sure when the rowing idea actually took hold. The first person he called was David Stookey of Newport, R.I., an international businessman and old friend who three years ago began publishing a newsletter, ''Open-Water Rowing.'' He asked Stookey if the idea was ''doable.'' It certainly was for Stookey, 57, an enthusiast fired by the image of ''unclubbable loners'' like rowers as a group. He pulled in two of his readers, John Mullen of Dallas and Louis Mackall of Branford, Conn.</p>
        <p>Mullen, who is 58, started rowing at 40. He says that his height -- 6-7 -- rather than his technique or conditioning helped him become a masters sculling champion. He has never rowed this long or in a group. He said, ''This is a stretch for me and I'm at an age when I'm looking for stretches.''</p>
        <p>His best friend and fellow Yale-trained architect, the 58-year-old Mackall, tries to start every day with a row. He began rowing 12 years ago. ''My theory is that all the bending mashes the internal organs in ways nothing else does,'' he said. ''So you've got beauty and exercise, a killer sunrise, and you feel fabulous all day long.''</p>
        <p>Although he has rowed more than 20 miles of a day, Mackall has never taken an overnight trip. He calls it an experiment.</p>
        <p>''This is not meant to be a stunt,'' said Stookey, who had to be reminded that it was Lenderking's idea, not his. ''It's just a row, not a race. Call it cruising or touring; some guys out to see the world. Of course, it would be good for open water rowing and the newsletter. There's a Web site, too.''</p>
        <p>Last week, on Stookey's advice, Lenderking drove up to Ontario to buy a 17-foot Loudon fiberglass boat for $2,200. On the drive back, he will stop to practice with Stookey in Newport. The schedule has the four boats going up the East River on Monday morning, June 26. With luck, they will pull into Gardiner's Creek on Shelter Island the following Thursday or Friday. Mullen and Mackall will row to their Hamptons houses the next day.</p>
        <p>I'm taking requests on this one. Tell thelipsite@aol.com. If you're interested, I will climb off my bike and cover this trip, which seems to fall between the buoys of the zeitgeist. At one marker is the explosion of extreme manufactured sports -- on my wall is a photo, sent by her agent, of the 31-year-old ''adventure athlete/action model'' Rebecca M. Rusch, climbing a rock wearing only shoes. At the other, under a gold-plated AARP sunset, is the implicit pressure of extreme prescription drugs -- to make us feel mellower, to grow more hair and have better sex.</p>
        <p>It is not lost on people of a certain age that the first two discards of the TV super hit, ''Survivors,'' were 62 and 60 years old. Of our rowboat survivors, only Lenderking had heard of the program; the other three are serious rowers with little time for popular culture, much less TV.</p>
