        <p>MY husband, Bill, holds a place in American history. He has to be one of the last men in America to cook on an old charcoal grill. He held on to his archaic wrought-iron barbecue grill with the same fervor Jeff Daniels held on to Little Roundtop in the movie ''Gettysburg.'' He just wasn't ready to move up to the more sophisticated level of the gas grill.</p>
        <p>After endless summers of guests and family waiting for the charcoal fire to be ''just right,'' countless meals where the food was either dangerously raw or burned beyond recognition, and one frantic call to the fire department, our daughters couldn't take it anymore. Last year for Father's Day they bought him a gas grill.</p>

        <p>MY husband, Bill, holds a place in American history. He has to be one of the last men in America to cook on an old charcoal grill. He held on to his archaic wrought-iron barbecue grill with the same fervor Jeff Daniels held on to Little Roundtop in the movie ''Gettysburg.'' He just wasn't ready to move up to the more sophisticated level of the gas grill.</p>
        <p>After endless summers of guests and family waiting for the charcoal fire to be ''just right,'' countless meals where the food was either dangerously raw or burned beyond recognition, and one frantic call to the fire department, our daughters couldn't take it anymore. Last year for Father's Day they bought him a gas grill.</p>
        <p>I knew what they had planned and decided I'd better prepare him for the shock.</p>
        <p>''The girls are giving you something I'm not sure you want for Father's Day,'' I said. ''I want you to act pleased.''</p>
        <p>''It's not a puppy, is it?''</p>
        <p>''Wait and see,'' I said.</p>
        <p>Since I'm a full-fledged coward, I wasn't home when the children delivered the grill, so I never saw his initial reaction. But by the time I arrived with two nice juicy steaks and a bottle of Newman's Own Bar-B-Que sauce, the cooking tools were laid out like surgical instruments, the fire was lighted in the new gas grill and the family was gathered around. I sensed we were on the verge of a new era in our lives.</p>
        <p>But there are grill people and non-grill people, and for all his valiant efforts, my husband will probably always be in the second group.</p>
        <p>Grill people are different. They worship at their grills, paying homage. They buy smart-looking grill covers, attachments, gauges, skewers, tongs, meat thermometers and heat-resistant cooking mitts.</p>
        <p>They deck and landscape the area around their grills. Every dinner party is a cookout. They like to wear oversize chef hats and aprons printed with snappy sayings like ''Who invited all these tacky people?''</p>
        <p>Grill people are aficionados of mesquite and liquid smoke, authorities on marinades. They patronize the best butcher in town. They are fans of the Food Channel, devotees of George Hirsch's program ''Know Your Fire,'' and they subscribe to all the cooking magazines. While others at a party are nibbling on hors d'oeuvres, sipping cocktails and exchanging gossip, grill people stand around comparing notes on recipes, cuts of meat and butcher shop bargains.</p>
        <p>Bill gave it his best shot, but the master grillers had a hard time watching this novice at work. At backyard picnics he'd be out there wearing his ''Keep your hands off my buns'' apron, the guests would be lined up expectantly holding salad-laden plates with open and empty hamburger rolls, and he'd forget what he was doing, wander away from the grill and stop to chat or pour himself a beer.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile the hamburgers sizzled untended until someone who took the whole thing much more seriously would move over to the grill and take Bill's place. When they saw a steak that demanded turning, a piece of chicken in need of basting or my husband carving a London broil as if he were an ax murderer, they'd rush to the rescue.</p>
        <p>As luck would have it, both my sons-in-law are grill people, great cooks who were born to barbecue. One of them does tricky things on his grill like smoked turkey for Thanksgiving. The other is equally dedicated. He's the kind of guy who cooks outdoors all year long, even if he has to do it while holding an umbrella or standing up to his ankles in snow.</p>
        <p>They cringe when my husband begins to barbecue, but they're models of respect and restraint. For his birthday, they gave him a grill cookbook.</p>
        <p>Bill and I sat down and read it together. He didn't think he was ready to try the Cantonese spare ribs or the grilled sea scallops with pecans and tarragon vin blanc sauce. We decided I'd be in charge of marinades and advance preparations and he'd take over from there. We'd keep it simple while he gained confidence.</p>
        <p>''After all,'' he said, ''when it comes right down to it, it's only caveman cooking. They put a piece of meat on a stick and held it over a fire, right? What's so hard about that? I'll bet when they grilled in Neanderthal days the cave was filled with smoke. Everybody probably sat around coughing. Caused all sorts of respiratory problems.''</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' I said, picturing the scene. ''I'm sure it covered the walls with soot, ruined the cave decor, all those beautiful drawings. You're right honey,'' I assured him, ''it's basically just plain primitive.''</p>
        <p>I don't care if Bill never wins any cooking contests. He can make a mean Manhattan and whip up a wicked martini and he has lots of other talents. I kind of like his primitive approach.</p>
