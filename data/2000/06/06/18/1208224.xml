        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The commercial producer Rocco Landesman, in his discussion of contrasts between commercial and nonprofit theaters [''Broadway: Devil or Angel for Nonprofit Theater? A Vital Movement Has Lost Its Way,'' June 4], has equated the enviable success of Todd Haimes's Roundabout Theater Company to its adoption of the philosophy that the ''audience is king,'' as if that was wrong and incompatible with producing quality and challenging works.</p>
        <p>A Roundabout subscriber does not have to wait outside the theater on a cold and rainy night if he arrives 35 minutes before the curtain. He doesn't have to pay a $5.75 service charge and a $2 ''convenience charge'' to buy a ticket to a show. He doesn't have to wait on extremely long lines because of limited restroom facilities. Unfortunately, Mr. Landesman fails to see that the customers of the ''commercial theater'' suffer all of those indignities and inconveniences.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The commercial producer Rocco Landesman, in his discussion of contrasts between commercial and nonprofit theaters [''Broadway: Devil or Angel for Nonprofit Theater? A Vital Movement Has Lost Its Way,'' June 4], has equated the enviable success of Todd Haimes's Roundabout Theater Company to its adoption of the philosophy that the ''audience is king,'' as if that was wrong and incompatible with producing quality and challenging works.</p>
        <p>A Roundabout subscriber does not have to wait outside the theater on a cold and rainy night if he arrives 35 minutes before the curtain. He doesn't have to pay a $5.75 service charge and a $2 ''convenience charge'' to buy a ticket to a show. He doesn't have to wait on extremely long lines because of limited restroom facilities. Unfortunately, Mr. Landesman fails to see that the customers of the ''commercial theater'' suffer all of those indignities and inconveniences.</p>
        <p>Providing customer amenities hasn't precluded the staging of acclaimed Roundabout productions of the masterworks of Chekhov, Strindberg and Shaw, along with plays by our greatest living authors, including Arthur Miller, Harold Pinter, Brian Friel, Paula Vogel and Beth Henley, among many others. If these works have a ''pernicious influence'' on English-speaking theater, give me ''pernicious.''</p>
        <p>In the last eight seasons under Mr. Haimes's leadership, Roundabout productions have received 58 Tony Award nominations, 54 Drama Desk nominations and 57 Outer Critics Circle nominations, often for musicals, like the environmental staging of ''Cabaret,''  ''1776,''  ''She Loves Me'' and ''Little Me,'' deemed not viable in the commercial theater, yet unchallenged in their artistic validity.</p>
        <p>Once again, the nonprofit arena teaches and leads. And those commercial organizations that learn from the nonprofits' example will benefit.</p>
