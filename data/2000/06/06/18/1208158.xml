        <p>Fans of classic luxury railroading have a new train to ride. Orient-Express Trains and Cruises started running its fifth train, the Northern Belle, in Britain last month.</p>
        <p>Unlike the company's famous Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, the Northern Belle does not have sleepers. It includes six dining cars, seating 252 passengers, and two kitchen cars. The diners are refurbished cars from the 1960's, air-conditioned and individually decorated in rich woods and fabrics to evoke the style of a stately home or castle for which they are named, like Chatsworth, Glamis and Warwick. The cars are pulled by a diesel engine, though the company says it may introduce a steam engine.</p>

        <p>Fans of classic luxury railroading have a new train to ride. Orient-Express Trains and Cruises started running its fifth train, the Northern Belle, in Britain last month.</p>
        <p>Unlike the company's famous Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, the Northern Belle does not have sleepers. It includes six dining cars, seating 252 passengers, and two kitchen cars. The diners are refurbished cars from the 1960's, air-conditioned and individually decorated in rich woods and fabrics to evoke the style of a stately home or castle for which they are named, like Chatsworth, Glamis and Warwick. The cars are pulled by a diesel engine, though the company says it may introduce a steam engine.</p>
        <p>The Northern Belle is scheduled for about 200 departures a year, mostly on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday and most from Manchester, Liverpool and York, for dinner or day trips. These go to places like Carlisle, Bath and across the Pennines, and to some of the cars' namesake homes. Outings for events like Ascot and weekend excursions to Scotland and Cornwall are planned, with stays in hotels. The menus feature Continental cuisine in modern British style -- for example, chilled cucumber soup, lobster salad with quail eggs, and quince and raisin cake.</p>
        <p>Prices start at about $175 (at $1.50 to the pound) for a four-hour lunch or dinner trip; a day trip from Manchester to Bath with two meals, about $220; weekend trips, $415 and up. Reservations: (44-161) 831-7900, fax (44-161) 831-7904; www.orient-express.com.</p>
