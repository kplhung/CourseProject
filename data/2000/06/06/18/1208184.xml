        <p>WHEN voters in the Bedford school district rejected the proposed 2000-2001 school budget last month it seemed like just another story of a defeat due to a price tag that was too high.</p>
        <p>After all, voters had also rejected budgets in Elmsford, Harrison, Tuckahoe and Valhalla. But in Bedford, it seems, it is not so simple.</p>
        <p>While almost no one will be quoted on the subject, many residents believe the budget defeat is, at least in part, a result of class and economic divisions in the sprawling district and a largely unspoken resentment toward the growing Hispanic population in the village of Mount Kisco.</p>
        <p>One resident said that some voters would like to reduce the number of non-English-speaking students, whom they view as an economic burden. The original budget proposal, for example, included 3.4 new teaching positions for English as a second language.</p>
        <p>The resident speculated that were it not for the Hispanics in the district, there wouldn't be a problem passing the school budget. There are 324 non-English-speaking students in the district, representing about 8 percent of the total 3,900 enrollment, with 80 percent of those students speaking Spanish.</p>
        <p>Hispanic residents refused to blame anti-Hispanic sentiment for the budget defeat. But many said they suspected that proposed cuts were aimed at programs that would benefit Hispanic students.</p>
        <p>Besides Mount Kisco, the district includes Bedford Hills and the wealthier communities of Bedford Village and Pound Ridge.</p>
        <p>The $67 million budget, which represented an 8.5 percent increase over last year, was defeated 1,836 to 1,370. But in a reversal of the usual pattern, where the less affluent tend to vote down school budgets to keep their taxes down, Mount Kisco voters approved the budget, 253 to 247, while Bedford Village rejected it, 606 to 323.</p>
        <p>''It's a tale of two districts,'' said Janet Foster, an organizer of Parents for the Educational Development of Students, which advocates the interests of academically gifted students. ''The tension in the district is because we're not homogeneous. We couldn't be more all-over-the-place. There is diversity, and for a lot of us, that's the appeal. But all the diversity makes it hard to get a consensus.''</p>
        <p>The district will have a second chance to seek consensus on Tuesday, when a revised budget, showing a 6.1 percent increase over last year, goes to a vote.</p>
        <p>The new budget adds two teaching positions for English as a second language, rather than 3.4, and adds an instructional assistant.</p>
        <p>Many parents believe that it is especially hard to find common ground when the five neighborhood-based elementary schools would seem to promote neighborhood, rather than district, loyalty. There may not be much in common between the multi-acre spreads of Pound Ridge, where there are many weekenders who are not involved in the schools and there has even been talk of seceding from the district, and the more compact houses and lots in Bedford Hills and Mount Kisco, where there are also condominium and apartment complexes.</p>
        <p>Paul Alcorn, the retiring school board president, said: ''There's great support for neighborhood schools, and less sense of responsibility to all seven schools, because the district is so big. It's geographically big and ethnically big. There's more at work than economics, including a large degree of complacency.''</p>
        <p>Beyond the Hispanic presence, other issues simmer close to the surface.</p>
        <p>As some see it, the school budget's defeat represents an attempt by some residents who oppose what they consider unnecessary frills, like after-school homework clubs, to force the district into an austerity budget.</p>
        <p>Under state law, any district that fails to pass a budget on its second attempt must adopt an austerity budget. Spending would be capped at 2.64 percent above the previous year's budget, except for expenses directly related to enrollment increases; allocations for supplies would be eliminated, the district could not buy new equipment or undertakeany capital improvement projects. It would also mean that Mount Kisco Elementary School, which has been without a permanent principal, would go through another year with a temporary administrator.</p>
        <p>Besides the revised budget of $65,341,508, residents will vote on a separate $488,500 proposition to cover after-school homework clubs and transportation; special arts-in-education programs; some capital improvements, like the renovation of windows at the Pound Ridge Elementary School; a gifted and talented program, a summer academy and additional academic support services.</p>
        <p>Some residents have been outraged by the spate of vituperative letters and fliers that have been distributed attacking the budget. For example, in May, Phil Christie, a resident, sent a letter to a local paper listing the salaries of district teachers and administrators. Others in the community believe there has been a deliberate disinformation campaign intended to persuade people that the budget is improperly financed.</p>
        <p>Susan Preece, a Mount Kisco parent with two teenagers, said: ''It's been real nasty and incredibly contentious. It's very frustrating.''</p>
        <p>The district has had its share of problems in the past.</p>
        <p>It drew widespread attention when three parents filed a lawsuit several years ago contending that activities at the school violated their families' religious beliefs because of instances in which some children were playing a fantasy trading card game called Magic: The Gathering. The game was used in an after-school enrichment program and as an extra-curricular activity.</p>
        <p>The district also drew a slap on the wrist from the state's education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, in May for a decision to help finance a student trip overseas.</p>
        <p>At meetings earlier this month to explain the revised budget, handouts were distributed to rebut allegations that the district's $16,484-per-pupil spending was higher than the tuition at some private schools. The handouts also compared teacher salaries throughout the county and listed additional budget cuts like after-school homework clubs and elementary intramural activities.</p>
        <p>Susan O' Brien, a parent who lives in Mount Kisco, said: ''We're making a huge effort to pass the budget, in trying to get the correct information out. Rumors spread fast, and people bought into the myths in a big way.''</p>
        <p>Another parent, Paula Sharp of Mount Kisco, said: ''I don't care how people vote. I just want them to be informed. I want to know that people have the facts.''</p>
        <p>EDUCATION  Correction:  June 25, 2000, Sunday  An article last week about the school budget in Bedford misspelled the surname of Philip Christe, a resident, and misstated how he publicized the earnings of top school administrators. He did so in an advertisement in a local newspaper, not a letter to the editor.</p>
