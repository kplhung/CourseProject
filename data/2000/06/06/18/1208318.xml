        <p>Behind every great watch is a great . . . watchband? So it seems with the Hermes Cape Cod steel watch for men. Introduced by Hermes in 1991, it has suddenly been whisked to must-have status this year by its new strap. Designed by Martin Margiela, the band is a leather double-wrap strap that winds around the wrist twice and buckles. The strap has so elevated the popularity of the Cape Cod ($1,625 at Hermes stores) that the company intends to release a women's version ($1,250) by summer's end. The strap can also be bought separately for $225 in black or natural Barenia leather and will fit any standard-size watch -- although customers will have to wait to get one. Apparently, even watchbands have their 15 minutes of fame.</p>
