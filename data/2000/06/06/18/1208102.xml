      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>No one halfway familiar with the Dutch will be surprised to read that they have managed to raise the level of voyeurism to new heights through national TV and the Internet (Marshall Sella, May 21). Take it from an ex-Dutchman: it's a centuries-old streak in the national culture. Have a look at the old burgher homes lining the canals in The Hague or Amsterdam and marvel at the enormous first-story windows, reaching down almost to pavement level. In an often gloomy climate, they had to be big, and curtains would defeat the idea. So passers-by can watch your TV if they like. Now look up to the higher stories and note the little mirrors outside many of the windows called (what else?) spionnetjes (little spies). You might even catch the reflection of a person watching whatever might be going on in the street.</p>
        <p>How far back does this go? In the 17th century, the Dutch were only mildly interested in paintings of Greek heroes or gods or Christian martyrs. But they readily shelled out good money for paintings that showed how folks they might see in the street lived from day to day, just as in the ''Big Brother'' television series.</p>
