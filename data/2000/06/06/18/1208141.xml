        <p>A POISONOUS Cuban toad, a tarantula bigger than your fist and a black scorpion from Texas are just the beastly part of the multimedia installation by the Chinese artist Huang Yong Ping at the Jack Tilton Gallery in SoHo. The work, on view through July, is titled ''Taigong Fishing, Willing to Bite the Bait''; it also includes drawings, photographs and a giant fishing net suspended from the gallery's ceiling.</p>
        <p>This is the artist's second show in New York; for the first, in 1997, he built ''The Pharmacy,'' a huge wooden gourd modeled on the medicine gourds used by Taoist priests in China. It was so big he had to be pulled out of it by a rope after bolting the pieces together inside (a photograph of it can be seen at www.artseensoho.com /Art/TILTON/ping97/ping1.html).</p>

        <p>A POISONOUS Cuban toad, a tarantula bigger than your fist and a black scorpion from Texas are just the beastly part of the multimedia installation by the Chinese artist Huang Yong Ping at the Jack Tilton Gallery in SoHo. The work, on view through July, is titled ''Taigong Fishing, Willing to Bite the Bait''; it also includes drawings, photographs and a giant fishing net suspended from the gallery's ceiling.</p>
        <p>This is the artist's second show in New York; for the first, in 1997, he built ''The Pharmacy,'' a huge wooden gourd modeled on the medicine gourds used by Taoist priests in China. It was so big he had to be pulled out of it by a rope after bolting the pieces together inside (a photograph of it can be seen at www.artseensoho.com /Art/TILTON/ping97/ping1.html).</p>
        <p>Mr. Huang's return trip to New York for the ''Taigong Fishing'' installation was busy and stressful. Upon arriving from his home in Paris, his first task was to purchase the animals he needed. Shuttling between pet stores on the Upper East Side and in New Jersey, he managed to round up the insects and reptiles that would be caged in a globe of the world, halved and sealed with Plexiglass, that would be wheeled around the gallery.</p>
        <p>Gathering the deadly mini-zoo, however, turned out to be the least of Mr. Huang's headaches. The show was nearly derailed because other parts of it -- the globe, a copper disk, a wooden pole, an old chair, a box of snakeskins -- that he had shipped from Paris were detained by customs because their declared value was only $16.</p>
        <p>The Tilton Gallery explained that the items were found objects and pieces of junk bought in thrift shops that had no value until assembled into a work by the artist. But customs officials wouldn't budge until every item had been inspected, which pushed the show's opening back three weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huang, 45, took the setback in stride: he simply went back to Paris, telling the gallery he would return once the shipment came through. (It did, he did.)</p>
        <p>The son of a tea grower from Fujian, a province on China's southeastern coast, Mr. Huang is best known in China and abroad for founding the Xiamen Dada group in 1986. Named after the port city Mr. Huang's family called home, the group consisted of half a dozen young artists who found their inspiration in the work of Marcel Duchamp and were also fascinated by Chinese traditional arts and culture.</p>
        <p>''We didn't know anything about Western art,'' Mr. Huang said in Chinese; he speaks no English and little French. ''We didn't know anything about traditional Chinese art traditions either. We looked to both of them as a way to liberate ourselves and our thinking.''</p>
        <p>In 1987, Mr. Huang created the piece he is still best known for, '' 'A History of Chinese Art' and 'A Concise History of Modern Painting' Washed in a Washing Machine for Two Minutes.'' The work was exactly what its title suggested, two books reduced to a small hillock of pulped paper. The sculpture unrepentantly lacked any aesthetic beauty and marked one of the first instances of purely conceptual art in China.</p>
        <p>News of Mr. Huang's work spread through China and in 1989 he was invited to participate in the landmark ''China/Avant-Garde Exhibition'' that was held in the National Art Gallery in Beijing. That show, organized by Gao Minglu, one of China's foremost scholars of contemporary art and the curator of the recent Asia Society exhibition ''Inside Out: New Chinese Art,'' was the first comprehensive gathering of contemporary and experimental Chinese artists.</p>
        <p>It was also the first time since 1949 that a public exhibition had not been dominated by Socialist Realism or political propaganda. Not surprisingly, it was shut down by the Chinese government just hours after the opening. As a result, Mr. Huang never got to realize the project he planned for it, ''Towing the China National Gallery Away.''</p>
        <p>Shortly after his botched Beijing debut, Mr. Huang was invited to France for an artist's residency, and he blames the ''excellent benefits the French confer on artists'' for the fact that he still lives there today.</p>
        <p>Despite speaking only Chinese, Mr. Huang manages to mount shows around the world. He says his lack of linguistic ability hasn't gotten in his way. ''I have friends in cities everywhere,'' he says, adding, ''And if I'm hungry I can always find a Chinese restaurant.''</p>
        <p>While he is best known as a Dadaist, there is more sense than nonsense in his work, according to Susan Maruska, director of the Tilton Gallery. ''He's creating tangible, extremely well-crafted objects,'' she says. ''He might show you the ridiculous, but just to give another perspective, another way to look at the ideas of healing, prediction, fortunetelling or colonialism.''</p>
        <p>His work since his early Dadaist period has been less absurd and, because of his geographical circumstance, less specifically Chinese. As an artist-in-self-imposed-exile, he now occupies an international territory. A number of contemporary Chinese artists like Mr. Huang have flourished outside China since the late 80's. Most of them went abroad on residencies or to study and then simply didn't go back, although they were free to travel in and out of China to visit family or buy materials.</p>
        <p>Their reluctance to return is understandable. The years following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre were marked by cautious conservatism by officials and artists alike. Shows were few and far between. The creative spirit of the country was scared into silence for a few years. Artists like Mr. Huang and Chen Zhen, who is also based in France, and the New York-based Xu Bing, Cai Guoqiang and Gu Wenda have all integrated themselves into the international art scene.</p>
        <p>Last year Mr. Huang was selected to represent France in the Venice Biennale. For the exhibition he prepared ''One Man, Nine Animals,'' a beautiful and elaborate colonnade topped with nine types of mythical beasts from Chinese folklore.</p>
        <p>Echoes of those beasts reappear in the New York show. The handful of live animals in Mr. Huang's globe are references to ancient Chinese symbols said to help in divination. Like tea leaves, the tarantula, lizard and other creatures may tell us something about the future -- if we dare get close enough to read them.</p>
