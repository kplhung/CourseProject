        <p>ONE of the most wide-ranging artists of the 20th century, the playwright, painter, essayist and filmmaker Jean Cocteau redefined the term eclectic.</p>
        <p>How fitting, then, that the Criterion Collection's important release of the three films that make up Cocteau's ''Orphic Trilogy'' also touches on the many facets of Cocteau's artistic makeup (DVD, three discs, 225 minutes, $79.95; available separately on VHS, $29.95 each).</p>
        <p>Cocteau took the unflaggingly imaginative creativity that served him so well in the other arts and translated it into the expressively cinematic images of the three films, in which he continued a lifelong exploration of the complex relationship between artists and their creations. As he himself notes, film was a perfect, if paradoxical, vehicle: it made dreams look real and made reality dreamlike.</p>
        <p>In his very first effort, ''Blood of a Poet,'' the neophyte director made one of the most transfixing, visually imaginative films ever: the scene where the poet falls through the mirror into an alternate reality is still enthralling. (Mirrors figure heavily in all of Cocteau's films: he called them ''portals through which we see our own deaths.'')</p>
        <p>The center of the trilogy, ''Orpheus,'' is perhaps the most problematic of Cocteau's films, simply because it attempts to simultaneously tell a story and comment on it -- a kind of cinema equivalent of a narrative and an essay. It's the least successful of the trilogy; yet it is as significant an example of Cocteau's artistic sensibility as anything else he created on film (or in any other medium, for that matter).</p>
        <p>Updating the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice to the Left Bank of Paris in the 40's allowed Cocteau to work on several narrative and symbolic levels; it's still fascinating to watch, even if ultimately the most memorable images are the ingenious ways Cocteau works in his beloved ''mirror portals,'' transporting his enigmatic characters to another plane of existence.</p>
        <p>With the director basically playing himself as an 18th-century time-traveling poet, with friends and lovers like Jean Marais, Pablo Picasso, Yul Brynner, Charles Aznavour and Jean-Pierre Leaud in cameos, how could Cocteau's final film, ''Testament of Orpheus,'' not be pretentious and self-serving?</p>
        <p>Surely Cocteau meant it to be: this is his final cinematic statement, as much a long-winded self-analysis as an extraordinary succession of visually arresting images -- in one, Cocteau walks past his doppelganger and angrily denounces him. The film's subtitle, ''Do Not Ask Me Why,'' can be seen as his tongue-in-cheek response to those who either look for or ignore any possible significance, and its creator's first spoken words in the film -- ''It is the unique power of cinema to allow a great many people to dream the same dream together'' -- shrewdly foreshadow the picture's surfeit of symbolism.</p>
        <p>As befits its historic and artistic importance, the ''Orphic Trilogy'' has been given a superb presentation on DVD. All of the films have received splendid digital transfers and new, improved subtitle translations, but it's the bonuses that make this one of Criterion's best releases yet.</p>
        <p>Each disc contains the transcripts of Cocteau's insightful essays for that film, and ''The Blood of a Poet'' includes both the text of the lecture Cocteau gave at an early screening of the film, as well as a collection of rarely seen photographs from the set of what Cocteau himself terms an ''amateur'' film; the stills don't really add much to one's appreciation of Cocteau's art, but they provide plenty of diversion.</p>
        <p>The centerpieces of the ''Orphic Trilogy'' collection are two absorbing, little-known films that illuminate both Cocteau's cinema and his art in general. The first is a 1984 documentary by Edgardo Cozarinsky: 66 minutes long, ''Jean Cocteau: Portrait of an Unknown'' rescues interviews with Cocteau conducted before his death, in 1963. He charmingly recounts his eventful life, colorful friendships (with Erik Satie and Igor Stravinsky, among others) and often misunderstood cinematic statements.</p>
        <p>''I am incessantly accused of being a fantasizer, of being facetious,'' he says without a trace of apology, as if in agreement. Mr. Cozarinsky's documentary empathetically demonstrates that, with Cocteau, there's no pandering or attitudinizing, only his unalloyed delight in creation, in bringing such novel visions into being.</p>
        <p>That tone is also evident in the 35-minute short, ''Villa Santo Sospir,'' included on the ''Testament of Orpheus'' disc. In addition to sharing several locations with the later feature, ''Villa Santo Sospir'' -- looking appropriately home-movieish in grainy 16mm -- finds Cocteau in an especially playful mood, going so far as to engagingly state, ''this film is not for judges,'' noting that it was simply made as a friendly greeting to his friends and colleagues.</p>
        <p>Cocteau's eclecticism may have caused detractors to damn him as a mere dabbler in various artistic endeavors. But this package -- his most personal and important films and the documents Criterion has added -- shows that Cocteau was as serious as he was mischievous about his art. And this boxed set -- Criterion calls it a ''limited edition,'' so grab it before you have to pay more to purchase the discs separately -- is necessary viewing for anyone who believes that film is an art form equal to the others that he pursued so passionately and devotedly.</p>
