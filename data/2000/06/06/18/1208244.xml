        <p>FOUR leafy, shady trees, aging veterans of city life that stood on the northwest corner of 84th Street and Madison Avenue and were nurtured over several decades by a succession of building owners, have been cut down, removed as a nuisance by the new tenant of a four-story building on the corner.</p>
        <p>The tenant, who had them cut down in late May, says they were old, rotting, dying and creating a nuisance. But neighbors and nature lovers say they are appalled. And the city's Parks Department, which is responsible for the trees, says it mistakenly told the owner she could do what she wished.</p>
        <p>''I've been living here for 30 years, and it's unbelievable that someone would kill these trees,'' said Jorge Lanus, who lives a block away on 85th Street. Mr. Lanus said he admired the trees' heavy, leafy canopy -- the largest of them reached the top of the building.. And Marge Ternes, chairwoman of Trees New York, a nonprofit organization, said that ''they were wonderful trees -- they were beautiful.''</p>
        <p>But the tenant, who would speak only on condition that she not be named, said that the trees ''were old, they were making dirt, they were weeds,'' and that ''the roots had dug up the cement and the foundation of the house.'' Robert Kashey, the owner of the house, one of an unusual row designed by the architect of Grant's Tomb, said, however, that he had never seen any damage to the house's interior and that the root system was quite shallow.</p>
        <p>Street trees in New York are owned by the city, not the adjacent property owner, and are regulated by the Parks Department. The new tenant said she had contacted the department about the trees, and Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern confirmed that a staff member, without checking maps or other documents, advised her that she could do what she wished with them, even though all four were beyond the property line.</p>
        <p>Commissioner Stern said that because the department had given incorrect advice, ''it would seem wrong'' to penalize the new tenant. But he added that ''hopefully what will come out of this is people's awareness -- and our own awareness -- that the city owns street trees.''</p>
        <p>''Trees that block billboards or advertising sightlines are at particular peril,'' he added. The trees on Madison -- two were on Madison, two on 84th -- would have competed with a new storefront planned for the building.</p>
        <p>The trees' surviving stumps measure from 11 to 30 inches at their widest, and were companions to buildings that are more than 100 years old. In 1892 the architect John H. Duncan built an unusual complex at 84th Street and Madison Avenue -- six four-story houses and, at the north end of the row, a five-story apartment building.</p>
        <p>Duncan, who also designed Grant's Tomb, gave this unusual group his preferred Greco-Roman styling but with something unusual -- ''a hint of Sullivan,'' said Paul Goldberger in his 1979 book, ''New York: The City Observed,'' in a reference to the Chicago architect Louis Sullivan, who was a teacher of Frank Lloyd Wright. There is truly something evocative of Wright's Prairie Style in the horizontal lines of red brick and sandstone, with the delicate terra cotta work at the frieze and cornice.</p>
        <p>IN 1914 the corner house was bought by the family of Edward Ridley Finch, a noted jurist. Judge Finch served on the New York State Supreme Court, on the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court -- where he was presiding justice -- and, from 1933 to 1943, on the State Court of Appeals.</p>
        <p>According to his 1965 obituary in The New York Times, he introduced the principal of summary judgment -- an immediate decision from the bench -- into New York court practice. Mary Finch, his wife, was a member of the Westhampton Garden Club.</p>
        <p>Anne Cox, their daughter, can remember the clinks and rattles of the milkman's horse-drawn wagon as the horse, without command, would follow the milkman as he walked from house to house. ''I remember father saying, There will always be horses in New York, because a horse can think,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cox also remembers that her parents ''loved gardens and trees'' and that the house stoop was always crowded with potted plants. So it was not remarkable when her parents encouraged the trees -- which she believes were ailanthus -- that sprouted near the base of their house. In the 1930's, they made a grille for one on Madison Avenue, to protect it from pedestrian traffic. The trees on Madison, especially, seemed like miracles, unexpectedly growing out of the sidewalk next to the building and obviously cared for by loving hands.</p>
        <p>During the Finch occupancy all the other houses in the row were converted to apartments with stores below, but the Finches held out against such changes, even as the traffic from Fifth Avenue and the eastbound Central Park transverse deluged 84th Street with motor vehicles. Judge Finch died in 1965 at age 91, and the family held on to the house until 1974, when they sold it to Mr.  Kashey, who ran the Shepherd Gallery out of the parlor floor and lived upstairs.</p>
        <p>Late last year Mr. Kashey leased out the building for 47 years. The new tenant said she would live on the top three floors but lease the ground floor and part of the basement to a retailer. ''With the kind of rents you get on Madison, it has to be something very, very high class,'' she said. The two-level store is to be 2,500 square feet -- 1,500 square feet on the ground floor, the rest in the basement -- and the annual asking rent is $375,000, including $250 a square foot for the ground floor.</p>
        <p>The tenant said that she would restore the stained glass, marble and other finishes in the house. ''Whatever was there originally, I'm going to put back, even nicer,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She said she also plans to build a large storefront on the Madison Avenue side, breaking out most of the wall on the ground and parlor-floor levels.</p>
        <p>The design is shown on the Web site of her retail leasing broker, Faith Hope Consolo, at www.Faith-Consolo.com.</p>
        <p>The building is included in the Landmarks Preservation Commission's Metropolitan Museum Historic District, and commission approval is required for any exterior renovations. Lisa Vangelas, the architect for the renovation, said that a plan for the storefront would be filed with the commission.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cox, who lives on East 66th Street and has not been up to her old house for a month or two, said she was upset at the loss of the trees.</p>
        <p>''Oh, no!'' she said. ''I watched them all growing up -- as long as Mummy was there the trees just grew, no matter what happened, they always sprang back.''</p>
        <p>Now at 84th and Madison there stand a few piles of sawdust. High on the 84th Street side, John H. Duncan's deep red brick is soiled with age. But there are strange feathery arcs -- as if the brick has been cleaned -- that most pedestrians would find hard to interpret. Only those who once saw the leaves there, lightly rubbing the brick from spring to fall for so many years, would understand.</p>
