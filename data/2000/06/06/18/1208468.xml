        <p>With the House about to begin two weeks of intense debate over competing proposals to add prescription drug benefits to Medicare, the differences between President Clinton and Republicans in Congress are widening by the day.</p>
        <p>Medicare drug benefits have emerged as one of the more potent political issues in this year's elections, as lawmakers and candidates continually hear voters complain about high drug costs. Both parties say their goal is to make drug coverage available and affordable to Medicare beneficiaries in every corner of the United States.</p>
        <p>The Republicans want more choices and options for beneficiaries, a larger role for private insurance companies, a smaller role and lower costs for the government.</p>
        <p>Democrats, by contrast, want more uniformity in premiums and benefits. They say the Republicans' free-market approach will confuse beneficiaries and encourage insurers to seek out healthy customers with relatively low drug costs, a practice known as cherry-picking.</p>
        <p>Representative Bill Thomas of California, the architect of the House Republican bill, said Republicans would push it through the Ways and Means Committee next week, with a view to securing passage by the full House by the July 4 recess.</p>
        <p>But Democrats are planning a major assault on the legislation. Indeed, they rehearsed their arguments at Congressional hearings this week, before details of the legislation were disclosed. Their strongest argument is simply that the Republican bill will not work, will not draw many private insurers into the market and therefore will not provide reliable coverage.</p>
        <p>The Republican proposal assumes that insurers can be induced to offer drug coverage subsidized by the government, just as health maintenance organizations have been induced to sign contracts with the government to care for 6.2 million Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>But when asked if insurers would be interested in offering drug coverage under Mr. Thomas's bill, Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, said: ''No, I don't think so. They would not sell insurance exclusively for drug costs. The government may find some private entities to administer drug benefits, but the government would have to accept all or nearly all of the financial risk.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton would offer the same drug benefits to all 39 million people on Medicare. House Republicans, by contrast, would describe a model insurance policy, known as ''standard coverage.''</p>
        <p>Insurers could offer alternative policies, with different premiums and benefits, provided the value was equivalent to that of the standard coverage.</p>
        <p>Republicans oppose a ''one size fits all'' drug plan. Beneficiaries, they say, should be able to choose a plan tailored to their needs.</p>
        <p>But Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said elderly people could be confused if they had a large number of choices.</p>
        <p>''It's difficult for seniors to navigate among plans,'' Ms. DeParle said.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Ms. DeParle asked: ''Do seniors want and need all these choices? If you let plans design all sorts of benefit packages, that promotes choice, but it also promotes cherry-picking of the healthiest seniors. That's why we need defined benefits. Seniors want to know what's covered. It must be predictable.''</p>
        <p>Republicans said Ms. DeParle had apparently not read their bill. Under the legislation, premiums and benefits would be subject to approval by Medicare officials. And the government could terminate its contract with any insurer that ''engaged in activities intended to result in favorable selection'' of beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>Democrats fear that the market for drug insurance would be filled with turmoil as insurers went in and out from year to year.</p>
        <p>In the last two years, dozens of H.M.O.'s have pulled out of Medicare or curtailed their participation, disrupting insurance arrangements for more than 700,000 elderly people, and more health plans are expected to withdraw this year.</p>
        <p>House Republicans refer to their bill as a bipartisan proposal because two Democrats, Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota and Ralph M. Hall of Texas, signed up as co-sponsors when Mr. Thomas introduced the bill on Thursday.</p>
        <p>But the measure, a Republican initiative, is strenuously opposed by many Democrats, who say drug benefits should be fully integrated into Medicare, like coverage of hospital care and doctors' services.</p>
        <p>The bill says Medicare officials must ensure that every beneficiary has a choice of at least two plans providing prescription drug coverage. One could be an H.M.O.; at least one must be a traditional insurer.</p>
        <p>But, Democrats say, even if beneficiaries have two options, both may be high-price plans.</p>
        <p>Under the House Republican proposal, Medicare officials could offer financial incentives to get insurers to enter markets in which no drug plans were available. The purpose of such incentives, as described in the bill, is to guarantee access to coverage.</p>
        <p>But Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House, said the availability of these incentives would encourage insurers to hold out for more money.</p>
        <p>''It would encourage insurers to hold Medicare hostage,'' Mr. Jennings said. ''The policy says that if insurers don't participate in the marketplace, we'll give them more money. Now, if you're an insurer, when do you decide to participate in the market? Is it at the beginning, when you get less money? If you hold out a little longer, you might get more. This is the most inefficient, ridiculous incentive mechanism one can imagine.''</p>
        <p>Medicare generally does not cover drugs for people outside the hospital.</p>
        <p>Drug spending for the elderly, from all sources including private insurance and the patients themselves, is unevenly distributed, and that complicates efforts to create new drug benefits.</p>
        <p>The Congressional Budget Office says that 13 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have no drug costs, while 57 percent have costs of less than $1,000 a year. Only 5 percent of beneficiaries have costs exceeding $5,000, but they account for 29 percent of total spending on drugs for Medicare recipients.</p>
        <p>President Clinton and Republicans agree that drug coverage should be voluntary. Representative Greg Ganske, Republican of Iowa, said he worried that ''only sick seniors will sign up,'' while those with low drug costs would not see insurance as a good buy.</p>
        <p>Under the ''standard coverage'' envisioned in the House Republican plan, the beneficiary would pay an annual $250 deductible and 50 percent of the next $2,100 in drug costs.</p>
        <p>Most patients would then become responsible for their drug expenses, but the beneficiary's out-of-pocket costs would be limited to $6,000 a year. The government would pay costs above that level, with a small contribution by private insurers.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders hope to pick up support from some moderate Democrats, but they may also lose some conservative Republicans, who oppose the expansion of federal programs. Representative Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, said he would vote against Mr. Thomas's bill.</p>
        <p>''We are adding new benefits to a program that is bankrupt from an actuarial point of view,'' said Dr. Coburn, a family physician. ''Maybe the American people want us to do that.''</p>
        <p>House Republicans would create a new agency in the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate with drug plans and H.M.O.'s. Republicans say the existing Medicare agency is a heavy-handed regulator that stifles competition by setting prices for thousands of medical goods and services.</p>
        <p>But Representative Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said the Republicans were simply ''manufacturing a new bureaucracy.''</p>
