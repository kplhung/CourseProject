        <p>DOTS, dots, dots and dots . . . and then more dots. That's what's in store for viewers of the 66 paintings on paper by the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama spread chockablock around a single room at the Art Museum, Princeton University: a relentless, restless sea of spots of saturated color, sometimes gathered into circular or columnar configurations against black backgrounds, sometimes spread broadcast across the entire sheet.</p>
        <p>In art as in life, the 1960's were a restless, fecund, tumultuous decade, and something of that tumult is reflected in the teeming vitality of Ms. Kusama's art. She gained considerable acclaim while working in New York from 1958 through 1973, but after her return to Japan that year (where she voluntarily committed herself to a mental institution, where she lives today, continuing to produce art as well as novels), her work was practically forgotten in the United States.</p>
        <p>But in 1989, when a short-lived nonprofit exhibition space called the Center for International Contemporary Arts mounted a concise retrospective of the obscure artist's work in 1989, it drew considerable attention. Interest in Ms. Kusama grew through the 1990's, culminating in 1998 in a major exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
        <p>That exhibition covered the years 1958 to 1968, stopping just one year short of the incident in which the artist had to be forcibly prevented from staging an unauthorized happening (''Grand Orgy to Awaken the Dead at MOMA'') in the same museum's sculpture garden, an event that made the front page of The Daily News. By the same token, the exhibition also made a neat division between Ms. Kusama's education and early work in Japan and the art that briefly brought her worldwide attention after her immigration to the United States.</p>
        <p>The merit of this exhibition (which also includes two small sculptures as well as the works on paper, all owned by a former gallery owner who championed the artist's work in the mid-60's) is to give viewers a glimpse of the continuity between Ms. Kusama's early Japanese period and her better-known work made in New York. In fact, nearly half of the pieces here are ones from the early 1950's that were reworked by the artist some time in the early 1960's. As David Moos writes in the exhibition catalog, ''her vibrant embrace of color -- hot pinks, glaring greens, and saturated blues -- jibes with the palette of American Pop in the early 1960's, the emphasis on radial compositions, repetitive markings, and a careful control of media are a direct consequence of techniques developed in Japan.''</p>
        <p>Since there are close similarities between many of the unrevised works from the two decades, as well between those and the pieces that Ms. Kusama did retouch, it can be surmised that her intention was less to update her work, but on the contrary to insist on the continuity between the two periods.</p>
        <p>In fact, if there is any quality that seems to be strikingly present in all of Ms. Kusama's work, it is precisely that of insistence. Although many of these drawings would stand quite brilliantly on their own, the crowded hanging here emphasizes the fact that this artist was more concerned, as Mr. Moos points out, with repetition and reiteration, so that each work is less a self-contained object than an extract from an ongoing work-in-progress.</p>
        <p>Crowding Ms. Kusama's work together helps bring out its intense visual and psychological pressure. Unfortunately, there is less justification for the crowding of another exhibition here, featuring sensitive, finely detailed images by Barbara Bosworth, a Boston-based photographer. Ms. Bosworth's subject is landscape, considered not only in itself but also as a setting for human pursuits as distinct as hunting and tourism.</p>
        <p>Among the works here is ''The Bitterroot River,'' 1995-97, a sequence of 24 separately framed black-and-white images. But Ms. Bosworth's more characteristic pieces are panoramic views created by printing two or three negatives together on a single sheet (in the case of black-and-white images) or by abutting separate prints within a single frame (with color images).</p>
        <p>''I wanted to make photographs that conveyed the feeling of being surrounded by the landscape,'' Ms. Bosworth has said. By multiplying the focal points within the image, she succeeds in capturing the sense of an experience that can't be taken in at a glance, but calls for a sequence of looks to comprehend. On the other hand, one has to wonder why she doesn't try printing her pictures on a larger scale. The drawback to her refinement of eye is a demurely recessive quality somehow at odds with the spatial sweep her photographs seek to encompass. Perhaps giving them a more theatrical sense of presence would help remedy that.</p>
