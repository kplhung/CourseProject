        <p>KNAPP-Lucille Gale. Died peacefully in her home at Wolsey Farm, Mt. Kisco, NY, on June 16, 2000, at the age of 94.

Mrs. Knapp was the beloved wife of the late Sanford R. Knapp. She was the President of Taylor-Knapp Company which mined silver and manganese in Philipsburg, MT. She also established the William and L. R. Gale Community Foundation and Galeton Foundation to benefit the citizens of Galeton, PA, and she cherished her summer home in Buck Hill, PA. Mrs. Knapp had been a resident of Riverdale, NY, where she was a lifelong member of the Riverdale Yacht Club. She is survived by her sister-in-law Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Knapp of Irvington, NY, her nieces Katharine K. Sherwood of South Salem, NY, and Carolyn K. Cullins of Burlington, VT, and great-niece Sarah G. Cullins and great-nephews Duncan R. Sherwood and Carter M. Sherwood. The memorial service will be held on June 29, 2000, at 11 AM, at St. Matthew's Church in Bedford, NY.
