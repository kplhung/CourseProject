        <p>AMONG many other things, Amy Finley Scott is known for her beautiful soups, which often have cream flowers or stars floating on top, and for her hand-painted, hand-cut jigsaw puzzles. She began making the puzzles one Christmas Eve in the late 1970's as a way to entertain her dinner guests while she prepared the next course in her minuscule Upper West Side kitchen. Ms. Scott, 52, has lived alone in New York since graduating from Smith College in 1969 and has a large family of friends she invites over on holidays.</p>
        <p>''Amy always provides family at Thanksgiving and Christmas for people who don't have family to plug in to,'' Simi Berman, a friend, said. ''The puzzles are part of that. You're all involved in a project while 'Mom's' cooking up some incredible thing in her 2-by-4 kitchen.''</p>

        <p>AMONG many other things, Amy Finley Scott is known for her beautiful soups, which often have cream flowers or stars floating on top, and for her hand-painted, hand-cut jigsaw puzzles. She began making the puzzles one Christmas Eve in the late 1970's as a way to entertain her dinner guests while she prepared the next course in her minuscule Upper West Side kitchen. Ms. Scott, 52, has lived alone in New York since graduating from Smith College in 1969 and has a large family of friends she invites over on holidays.</p>
        <p>''Amy always provides family at Thanksgiving and Christmas for people who don't have family to plug in to,'' Simi Berman, a friend, said. ''The puzzles are part of that. You're all involved in a project while 'Mom's' cooking up some incredible thing in her 2-by-4 kitchen.''</p>
        <p>In some ways, Ms. Scott's life in New York has been like a jigsaw puzzle itself. A landscape and still-life artist, she has made ends meet by piecing together all sorts of odd jobs, from building loft beds to sewing stuffed animals. In her free time, she has sung with several choral groups, collects windup toys and swims regularly at the Trinity School near her apartment. Over the years, she had several beaus, though none turned into husbands. ''One time, my mother said to me, 'I just think you haven't had good luck with men,' '' Ms. Scott remembered. ''And I said, 'No, I think I've had wonderful luck. I never married any of them.' ''</p>
        <p>Two years ago, when Ms. Scott turned 50, she decided it was time to give another party. ''I was feeling hugely soggy,'' she said. ''I mean, 50. Gosh, it sounded so old.'' So she invited 40 guests over for appetizers and puzzles. The guest list included Sam Bryan, a recently widowed man she knew casually from the neighborhood and from the Trinity pool.</p>
        <p>Like her, Mr. Bryan, 61, has always pieced together many different jobs. Most recently, he has been teaching English as a second language at the American School of Ballet in Manhattan and lecturing on film history at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''At one point, I went over to his table, and he was telling a story and being very funny and sharp,'' Ms. Scott said. ''That's when my antenna went up. I had put sense of humor firmly back at the top of my list of qualities that were important to me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bryan's antenna also went up that night. ''Amy's always been this attractive, bright artist in the neighborhood,'' he said. ''I wasn't sure if she was living with someone or single. When I asked the questions -- how many husbands, how many children? -- there was a big zero on the scorecard. It was amazing to me.''</p>
        <p>Soon after the party, they started timing their morning swims at Trinity to coincide. ''We would see each other in bathing suits and goggles,'' Mr. Bryan said. ''One day, I lured her back to my apartment for coffee. We laughed together, and I said, 'You're fun!' and she looked at me and said, 'So are you!' ''</p>
        <p>Soon, they could be seen together around the neighborhood, looking nothing like their ordinary selves. ''I once saw them in a rather nice restaurant sitting there wearing animal noses, a pig snout and a parrot nose,'' Susan Brown, a friend, said. ''Amy has a collection of them; her cat used to wear them.'' Ms. Brown added: ''People who can be free and un-self-conscious like that don't just grow on trees. It was important to Amy to find someone who was fun. Sam goes through life kind of seeing things with a grin.''</p>
        <p>On June 9, they were married before about 25 guests in the Shakespeare Garden in Central Park. A few days before, the bride said she was nervous at first about getting married. While she had explored many worlds, from choral singing to carpentry, she knew nothing about being a wife.</p>
        <p>''Then, someone said to me, 'Marriage is really an agreement between two people to wing it together,' '' she said. ''I just loved that. It took the pressure off me, the feeling that you're supposed to know how to be married. I don't know a lot about marriage, but I know a lot about winging it.''</p>
