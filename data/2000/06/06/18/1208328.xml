        <p>Dr. Caroline Seay Clauss, a psychologist, and Julian Charles Edward Ehlers, a chef, are to be married today by the Rev. Dr. Earle Sanford, a United Methodist minister, at St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia University in New York.</p>
        <p>The bride, 32, is known as CC and will use the surname Clauss-Ehlers, as will the bridegroom. She is the senior consultant in New York for Cook Ross Inc., an organizational and educational consulting firm. She is also an adjunct assistant professor of psychology and education at Columbia University, from which she received a doctorate in counseling psychology. She graduated from Oberlin College. She is a daughter of Carole and Harold Clauss of Stratford, Conn.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 34, is the chef de cuisine at Acacia, a Manhattan restaurant. Until October, he owned the Green Dragon, a restaurant in Haddenham, England. He graduated from Thames Valley University in Slough, England. He is a son of Valerie Ehlers of Maidenhead, England, and the late Edward A. Ehlers.</p>
        <p>The couple met in Florida in 1998, at a wedding of a woman who was a friend of Dr. Clauss and a cousin of Mr. Ehlers, who was visiting from England. During a dance, another guest stepped on Dr. Clauss's foot. Mr. Ehlers, sitting on the sidelines, found a cold compress and began a conversation. A cross-Atlantic relationship ensued. After proposing marriage last summer while the couple traveled in Venezuela, Mr. Ehlers sold his restaurant and joined Dr. Clauss in New York.</p>
