        <p>RE: Update on New Lines of Business</p>
        <p>As you would of heard by now, the recent LCN 2000(R) initiative to increase annual revenue by hustling stocks to greedy investors met with a setback last week due to unforeseen federal indictments. We see this as another misguided attempt by headline-hunting prosecutors to discourage innovation and limit competition in the growing global organized-crime business. Be that as it may, I am pleased to give you this update on various other LCN 2000(R) strategic business initiatives, all firmly anchored to our well-established brand names:</p>

        <p>TO: Members of the Commission</p>
        <p>FROM: Vinnie (Sausage Lips) Dellicatessio, chairman, La Cosa Nostra 2000(R) committee</p>
        <p>RE: Update on New Lines of Business</p>
        <p>As you would of heard by now, the recent LCN 2000(R) initiative to increase annual revenue by hustling stocks to greedy investors met with a setback last week due to unforeseen federal indictments. We see this as another misguided attempt by headline-hunting prosecutors to discourage innovation and limit competition in the growing global organized-crime business. Be that as it may, I am pleased to give you this update on various other LCN 2000(R) strategic business initiatives, all firmly anchored to our well-established brand names:</p>
        <p>HELLO? OMERTA CALLING!(R) Keyed off our trademarked Code of Silence(R), we offer a service to clients who are irritated by those rude people using their cell phones at theaters, in restaurants and elsewhere. Just dial 1-800-SILENCE, provide a (legit only!) credit-card number, and presto: an Omerta agent, like our New York rapid-response rep Santore (Crunchie) Multimalo, arrives on the scene, forcibly removes the cell phone from the offending party and -- here's the beautiful part -- eats it.</p>
        <p>MAFIONYMS(R) Ever since Joe Valachi started squealing in the 1960's, Americans have been fascinated by mob nicknames. Until now, these monikers have been strictly reserved for our own associates. But now, with Mafionyms(R), anyone can join the fun! Just stop by for a personal consultation at a convenient Mafionym(R) kiosk at your local shopping mall. Badda-bing, badda-bang, badda-boom, you walk away with your very own mob nickname -- just like the real ones. Testimonials from happy customers are pouring in:</p>
        <p>''I adore the feeling of being so, like, connected!!!''</p>
        <p>-- Sue-Emily (Really White Sneakers) Reynolds, Santa Barbara, CA.</p>
        <p>''The guy in the next cubicle? Green with envy.''</p>
        <p>-- Brad (Flamer) Tinkley Harris, Worcester, MA.</p>
        <p>''My new Mafionym(R) drives my mother crazy!''</p>
        <p>-- Lonnie (Always With the Decaf) Latoosh, Philadelphia, PA.</p>
        <p>AQUA PERSUASION(R) You might of read in the paper last week that some fancy restaurants are pressuring customers to order expensive bottled water to pad those dinner and lunch checks. Overworked small-restaurant owners without pushy staff can now hustle the H20 just like the big joints. Simply call in our Aqua Persuasion(R) sales team! Our surly bruisers will arrive tableside wearing T-shirts that say, ''Excuse me, you are having the bottled water.'' Watch those bottles of Evian and Pellegrino move!</p>
        <p>(Also on the food-service front, LCN 2000(R) will soon announce details of our latest strategic restaurant initiative, in partnership with one of our Brooklyn dessert-foods subsidiaries: I SCREAM, YOU SCREAM, YOU BETTER STOCK THIS ICE CREAM(R).)</p>
        <p>COVER ME, OR TALK TO THEM(R) Tired of pleading with those passive-aggressives at your H.M.O. who refuse to approve treatment for that pesky heart attack or broken leg? Just call Cover Me or Talk to Them(R) and our specially trained H.M.O. negotiators will get right on the case! Within hours, those H.M.O. chumps will display a new understanding of terms like necessary procedure and hospitalization. Know what I mean? No paperwork!</p>
        <p>As you can see, we here at LCN 2000(R) are neither resting on our laurels nor going to the mattresses as we look at the exciting challenges facing the commission in this high-tech, entrepreneurial world. Look for lots of exciting news in coming months, including our long-planned entry in the Internet security field with our initial public offering, I-GOT-YOUR-VIRUS-RIGHT-HERE.COM. And development is well underway for two new network game shows, ''Who Wants to Rob a Millionaire?'' and ''Survive This!''</p>
        <p>Also in the works is ''Knock Knock, This Is Your Life,'' a reality-based show in which some of the boys make a surprise visit each week to various old friends currently in the federal witness protection program.</p>
        <p>So what if we took a hit in the stock market! Our future is bright, gentlemen, because we're organized, we're flexible, we're LCN 2000(R), the family brand.</p>
