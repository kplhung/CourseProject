        <p>While many children await the warm breeze that ushers in summer break, for Joe Machicotte, the seasonal break from school meant not freedom, but three long, hot months spent indoors, in a high-rise apartment project in Harlem.</p>
        <p>''There's not a whole lot for you to do in the projects,'' said Mr. Machicotte, now 36, who spent summers with his younger brother and grandmothers. ''It was unsafe for you to go downstairs on your own. Summers were spent all day in the house unless one of our grandmothers wanted to take us to church or the store for a walk.''</p>

        <p>While many children await the warm breeze that ushers in summer break, for Joe Machicotte, the seasonal break from school meant not freedom, but three long, hot months spent indoors, in a high-rise apartment project in Harlem.</p>
        <p>''There's not a whole lot for you to do in the projects,'' said Mr. Machicotte, now 36, who spent summers with his younger brother and grandmothers. ''It was unsafe for you to go downstairs on your own. Summers were spent all day in the house unless one of our grandmothers wanted to take us to church or the store for a walk.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Machicotte said he spent most of his time watching cartoons or reruns of ''Gilligan's Island.'' But one summer, when he was 12, he was able to enjoy the outdoors with children from across the city, courtesy of the Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that provides children with free summer vacations. That summer, Mr. Machicotte went to one of the agency's five camps in upstate New York. The experience expanded his horizons more than he knew at the time, he said, and gave him a window into a different world.</p>
        <p>''When you live in New York City, you think that you're in the center of the universe,'' he said. ''I knew that these other places existed, but I couldn't imagine that you could actually sleep out there.''</p>
        <p>The vacations often go beyond the simple goals of giving a poor child from the city a chance to swim or play sports in an open field. The trips also shape their aspirations and their attitudes about race and culture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Machicotte said that after spending the summer outside the city, his goal was to eventually own a home in the suburbs. ''I actually saw things to acquire, things to want to go to school for,'' he said. He is now director of diversity programs for a food service provider called the Compass Group, and owns a home in Westchester County near a lake.</p>
        <p>Beneath the surface of summer fun in the country, a subtext plays itself out every year. Although the Fresh Air Fund does not keep statistics, its Friendly Town program ends up pairing mostly minority city children with mostly white rural and suburban families who volunteer to act as their hosts for a summer. The experience introduces each to a different way of life.</p>
        <p>''It allowed me to realize that in my growing and my advancing, I'm going to be with other races,'' recalled Kyle Allman, 28, who is black. ''I don't need to grow and advance with my race alone.'' After spending three summers with a family in Mannahawkin, N.J., through the fund's Friendly Town program, Mr. Allman was invited back seven more times.</p>
        <p>Though he was nervous at first, Mr. Allman said, once he met his host family, Mary and Mike Palmer and their three boys, he realized that their similarities outweighed their differences. The Palmer family came to consider him another son, and he remains close to them. ''They cherished family, I cherished family,'' Mr. Allman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Machicotte, who is African-American and Hispanic, said that the experiences made him think differently about race and background. ''It was very surprising to see how many people were Caucasian and were involved in this and were doing this for us,'' he said of the counselors and staff at the camp.</p>
        <p>The Friendly Town program also helps hosts better understand people from different backgrounds. ''We didn't know at all what to expect from a city child,'' Mrs. Palmer said. ''We thought he'd be all rambunctious and street-wise, but he was just a sweet little kid.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Palmer said she gained a deep respect for Kyle's mother, Bertreann, a social worker who raised three children as a single parent. ''Over the years,'' Mrs. Palmer said, ''she did whatever difficult things she had to do for the sake of her child.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Allman, who is now a circulation manager for Black Enterprise magazine, credits his mother and the private school he attended in Philadelphia for instilling in him a desire for a better life, but he also gives a lot of credit to the Fresh Air Fund.</p>
        <p>For the host families, one payoff comes in the form of knowledge that they have made a difference in a child's life, and made lifelong friendships. ''They're a big part of who I am today,'' Mr. Allman said of the Palmers.</p>
        <p>Families interested in having a child stay with them or who wish to inquire about registering their children for a Fresh Air summer vacation can call (800) 367-0003 or visit the agency's Web site, www.freshair.org. Anyone interested in making a tax-deductible contribution to the agency can send a check to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.</p>
