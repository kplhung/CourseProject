        <p>Q: Back in 1972, you argued in a case that the actor Lee Marvin's girlfriend of six years deserved half of his $3.6 million in assets. How did you become the father of palimony?</p>
        <p>Michele Triola had been a tenant in my mother's building. She had broken up with Lee and made an agreement to get like $1,500 a month for seven years. He paid her for three and then stopped because he married his high school sweetheart, who said, ''You're not paying that woman any more money.'' So I filed the first palimony suit, and I finally got the California Supreme Court to take the case in 1976, and they decreed that unmarried people had rights and could sue for breach of contract. If they proved it, of course. Some 45 states have since accepted it in one form or another and 10 different countries, and it's known as the Marvin case, which is nice.</p>
        <p>Was Lee Marvin as tough as he was in, say, ''The Dirty Dozen''?</p>
        <p>He was tough, and he was funny. I thought I would catch him on the stand when I said, ''How would you describe the strongest feeling you ever had for this woman?'' He said, ''Well, I'd say it was like a tank of gas that was only half full.''</p>
        <p>How did you end up in divorce law?</p>
        <p>Sheer luck. James Mason's wife, Pamela Mason, fired her first lawyer because she said he was driving his yellow convertible down Sunset Boulevard with her case in the back of the car and the papers were flying out all over Brentwood and the beach. It turned out to be a big case for me. At the last minute, we settled on the courthouse steps for $4 million.</p>
        <p>Hollywood must be the dream location for a divorce lawyer. In your professional opinion, why do so many Hollywood marriages fail?</p>
        <p>Actually, the divorce rate is the same in the entertainment industry as it is everywhere else. But there are a lot of things in that business to drive a couple apart. Media scrutinizing relationships. News about who's having an affair. The public appetite for celebrity gossip is so voracious. Speaking of that, I represented Regis Philbin years ago after he had been a sidekick to Joey Bishop. His salary dropped from like $90,000 to $27,000, and he went in to lower his support to his ex-wife. The court decided that he could lower it for six months, writing that from all indications Regis Philbin would never make it. They said that he would never be a star.</p>
        <p>Your license to practice law was suspended in 1993. Why?</p>
        <p>Income tax violation, from 1983 to 1986. Ten years later they decided to charge me. I had an accountant who put in front of me three or four inches of tax returns, and I signed without reading. If I had read every page carefully, I would have seen that there were expenses that would be challenged. I take blame because I wasn't careful. If you're careful, these things don't happen to you. I was a little too arrogant. I was trying to be all things to all people.</p>
        <p>And you served two years in prison. What did you do there?</p>
        <p>I ran the law library, and you're allowed to practice law in prison in that you can help your fellow prisoners. I helped 75 or 100 of them. I even worked on appeals that helped a few prisoners get released. I worked until midnight on some of these cases. I helped people learn to read and write. I started an opera club there. We had public-speaking classes. I started a French class too.</p>
        <p>An opera club? That sounds like a dangerous hobby in prison. Did your fellow inmates give you any guff for it?</p>
        <p>I didn't get any guff. In Lompoc, you're dealing with white-collar people. There's a lot of freedom in that camp. There's no lock-down. You can walk away if you want. But no, I didn't get any trouble from anyone for the opera club. The club was the highlight of my time there. We would watch opera videos and then critique them.</p>
        <p>The California bar reinstated you recently, and now you have your bar card again. How does that feel?</p>
        <p>So good. I have been on cloud nine since I heard. That was the toughest case I ever had, and I won it.</p>
        <p>But why go back into law? So many lawyers are miserable and secretly writing screenplays.</p>
        <p>I love being a lawyer. I would be at a real loss if I couldn't do that. You know about the Marvin case, but what people don't know is that in 1963 I went to the U.S. Supreme Court and established the right of indigents to have a free lawyer. It was a forerunner to Miranda. I took my mother and my wife, and I was trembling when I got up to speak. But I won a case in the Supreme Court that meant a lot to a lot of people. These things mean a lot to me.</p>
