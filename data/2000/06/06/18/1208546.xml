        <p>Re ''Parents Try to Reclaim Their Children's Time'' (news article, June 13): I find it interesting that in this day and age of school shootings, many parents put so little importance on family time.

        <p>Your article noted a shocking comment -- that parents have said '' 'If I get this time with my family, you have to show me what to do with my kids.' '' Why do we feel that our children must be entertained every second and that we are the ones responsible for the entertainment? As in most relationships, there can be a lot of satisfaction in just being together.</p>
