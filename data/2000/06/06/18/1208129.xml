        <p>'Affinities and Influences'</p>
        <p>Gallery North, 90 North Country Road, Setauket. Through July 16. (631) 751-2676.</p>
        <p>The show pairs five artist-teachers with five of their former students and explores the similarities and differences between mentor and protege. In some cases the affinities are apparent, while in others they seem almost nonexistent.</p>
        <p>There is no relation, for instance, between Stan Brodsky's nature-based painterly abstractions and David Goldstein's minimal self-portraits. Whatever creative stimulus was at work between them, it is not manifested in style or content.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brodsky translates his close observations of natural phenomena into evocative colors and rhythms, while Mr. Goldstein wittily examines identity as a kind of blank slate, or perhaps a shadow of self.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Robert White's figure sculptures have nothing in common with Linda Cassidy Burke's landscape paintings, one of which combines an impressionistic vista with a contrasting panel of mountains, as if one were real and the other imagined. This kind of divergence is interesting in itself, showing that not all students become followers.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, a strong correlation is evident in the paintings of James Lecky and Brian Jermusyk. Both use academically derived formalism to create stiff, lifeless set pieces, although Mr. Jermusyk's colors are harsher and his figures more stylized than those of his former teacher.</p>
        <p>Marcia Widenor and Mary Leto share a common medium -- hand-formed paper -- but each uses it in an individual way. Ms. Widenor's pieces are sculptural, with independent forms floating in harmonious balance, while Ms. Leto makes flat sheets of paper that highlight textural and tonal variations.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most interesting pairing in the exhibition is the drawings of Mel Pekarsky and the photographs of his former student Jeffrey Sturges. At first, their work seems unrelated. But ultimately their work reveals a shared concern with what Mr. Pekarsky describes as ''the tension between abstraction and representation.''</p>
        <p>Miriam Schapiro  Heckscher Museum of Art, 2 Prime Avenue, Huntington. Through Aug. 13. (631) 351-3250.</p>
        <p>This traveling exhibition, organized by the Tucson Museum of Art, surveys three decades of prints, drawings and collages by Ms. Schapiro, whose imagery frequently incorporates autobiography into a larger feminist agenda. Her ideology is rooted in personal experience and, true to modernism's preoccupation with self-expression, emerges from inner necessity rather than an ideological program.</p>
        <p>One of the show's many pleasures is the opportunity it affords to trace recurring themes and motifs through various incarnations. A 1964 print, ''Homage to Lithography,'' introduces two of the artist's long-term preoccupations: the shrine format and homage to her creative forebears. Both recur in various guises throughout the exhibition, ''Miriam Shapiro: Works on Paper.'' Indeed, some of the most recent pieces, like ''My History'' and ''Lost and Found,'' reiterate aspects of Ms. Schapiro's early prints and collages  while focusing more directly on personal and family history, specifically her artistic lineage and Jewish heritage.</p>
        <p>Like the patchwork quilts that have provided her with a rich source of visual and cultural raw material, Ms. Schapiro's work is an accumulation of fragments that have been collected, assembled and given new meaning. The references to traditionally feminine decorative art, especially needlework, are deliberate, but there is nothing condescending in such quotations of ''women's work.''</p>
        <p>In pieces that refer to distinguished female artists like Frida Kahlo, Alexandra Exter and Liubov Popova, those artists' transformation of folkloric and decorative traditions provides a context for Ms. Schapiro's own extrapolations.</p>
        <p>Another, and related, recurring theme is costume, both everyday clothing and theatrical display.  Pieces of fabric, from lacy handkerchiefs and cotton dress material to tapestries and theater curtains, suggest how roles are defined by attire.  The house, a symbol of domestication and women's sphere of influence, is also adapted as a proscenium stage where life's comedies and tragedies are enacted, and as a potent reference to the dichotomy of nurture and entrapment.</p>
        <p>Schapiro/Greene  Arlene Bujese Gallery, 66 Newtown Lane, East Hampton. Through Thursday. (631) 324-2823.</p>
        <p>Another dominant aspect of Ms. Schapiro's work, much in evidence in this presentation, is its sensuous appeal. The tactile quality of fabric is enhanced with applied textures, glitter and calligraphic flourishes, as in ''Mother Russia,'' decorated with sequins, and the fan-shaped ''Asian Miracle.'' In the show's largest work, ''Autobiography,'' glitter substitutes for the embroidery traditionally used to render stylized motifs on a the squares of a patchwork quilt, which provides the framework for an anthology of personal symbolism. By transforming familiar, even mundane, modes of abstraction, the artist invites us to re-evaluate the distinction between so-called fine and decorative art.</p>
        <p>Balcomb Greene's paintings represent an altogether different approach to sensory stimulation. In his case, it was the light and atmosphere of the shoreline near his Montauk home that he sought to evoke. The rocky beach, with its pounding surf and diffused illumination, preoccupied him for some 40 years, from the early 1950's until his death in 1990. While he also painted figure studies and urban scenes, he is perhaps best known for coastal landscapes like those on view here.</p>
        <p>With roots in hard-edged geometric abstraction, Greene evolved a style that used light to fragment form. Nature's inherent structure became his pictorial armature, but that structure is always in flux.  Whether it is the solid, immobile masses of boulders or the constantly changing shapes of waves, his forms are defined by elemental forces. In ''Land and Sea,'' for example, rocks and waves vie for dominance like opposing armies locked in eternal conflict. In several canvases, the clash is muted by mist and spray, while in others the drama is heightened by stormy skies and agitated seas. When the sun breaks through, as in ''Near the Lighthouse'' and ''Rocks and White Sand,'' the calm promises to be short-lived.</p>
