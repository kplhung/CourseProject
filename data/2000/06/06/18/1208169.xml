        <p>ERIC BERGSTOL brought his golf cart to a screeching stop and uncurled the lanky frame that at one time had him touring South America as a semiprofessional basketball player.</p>
        <p>On this beautiful spring day, Mr. Bergstol loped over to a grassy area and splayed his arms forward.</p>
        <p>''Look at this,'' he said as he stood at the third hole, under construction at Pine Hill Golf Club. ''This is something you can't find on a public course anywhere for hundreds of miles around. Before him, were hills and rills and rises of all kinds. Trees and a wooded stream were off to his right and left. In the distance, the sun was shimmering off the Philadelphia skyline.</p>
        <p>''I do houses and commercial developments and they are nice and make money,'' said Mr. Bergstol, president of the Bergstol Enterprises development company. ''But a good golf course, I think it can be a work of art.''</p>
        <p>When it opens in the fall, Pine Hill Golf Club will be one of four upscale public courses Mr. Bergstol will have developed in New Jersey. His first two -- New Jersey National Golf Club at The Hills in Basking Ridge and Pine Barrens Golf Club in Jackson -- have won various awards from the golf cognoscenti. Like Pine Hill, Twisted Dune Golf Club in Egg Harbor Township is under construction and will be open for full play next year.</p>
        <p>But it is Pine Hill that Mr. Bergstol sees as his signature. Built on a former ski slope, the land on which Mr. Bergstol is building Pine Hill was taken over by the borough of Pine Hill for taxes in 1995, after the owners of the ski area went into bankruptcy. For the next several years, the borough unsuccessfully tried to find a use for the 186-acre site, until Mr. Bergstol bought an additional 174 acres adjacent to the site and presented the idea of an upscale public golf course.</p>
        <p>''It's very hard to get approvals for golf,'' Mr. Bergstol said. ''There are so many issues between the environment and other development items. But some communities really like golf, since it preserves open space and, if you do it right, you actually enhance the environment.''</p>
        <p>Tom Hassett, the councilman in Pine Hill in charge of economic development feels Mr. Bergstol has done just that. ''This property was a mess, a burned out area where people would race cars, junk them and leave them there,'' he said. ''He has cleaned everything up, preserved the trout stream, done everything we've asked. And to be able to bring in Tom Fazio, who turns down 10 designing jobs for every one he takes, well, that is amazing. This will truly be something we will be proud of.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bergstol has done much the same in his other New Jersey courses. At New Jersey National, he used parkland around an existing residential community. At Pine Barrens, he used 420 acres, double that of the usual public golf course, to leave environmentally sensitive areas undeveloped within the grounds. He has done much the same at Pine Hill, which he thinks will actually enhance the golfing experience there.</p>
        <p>''Look, here's mountain laurel and here's a trout stream that was all but dormant before we came here,'' he said while driving a golf cart on the winding path through the woods between holes four and five. There and between the next four holes, the trail from the green to the next tee goes through environmentally sensitive park and wetlands. It cost Mr. Bergstol more to buy and work around the extra acreage, but he thinks that is what will make Pine Hill stand out from run-of-the-mill public course.</p>
        <p>''Great golfers want real golfing challenges, and we will give them that on our courses,'' he said. ''But everyone who comes out wants an interesting experience. Going through these woods between holes will make the whole experience more pleasant. And the views when you come out of the woods, well, you just can't beat them anywhere in New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bergstol grew up in Rockland County, N.Y., and he still lives there. A pretty fair basketball player, he took his game to Kings College in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and then did his stint as a semipro abroad before coming back into the family construction business.  But he was also a scratch golfer and decided to bring his golfing passion to his business. He needed a niche, and high-end public courses seemed to be it.</p>
        <p>''People pay these outrageous initiation fees and then $6,000 or more a year just to play a good private course in New Jersey and New York,'' Mr. Bergstol said. ''There are municipal courses that are reasonable,  but many of them aren't well kept. So the demographics were there -- a lot of golfers with some, but not endless supplies, of money who wanted good courses.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bergstol doesn't claim that courses are rock-bottom cheap. Depending on times, it costs $85 to $105 to play 18 holes at Pine Barrens, two to three times that of many public courses in the state. By the time Pine Valley opens, it may be more than that to play there. But Mr. Bergstol defends that as a fair price for what he is offering.</p>
        <p>''This will be a unique course,'' he said as the golf cart stops at the 17th hole, which Mr. Bergstol says is his favorite. The bluegrass and sawgrasses on the rough and fairway are starting to grow in, covering the loamy sand. The pine-lined steep hills up and down the 17th are scenic in themselves, and the skyline of Center City Philadelphia looms in the distance.</p>
        <p>And a driver and two irons away is Pine Valley Golf Club, perennially the top golf course in the nation as rated by Golf Digest magazine. ''We don't mention Pine Valley around here,'' Mr. Bergstol said. ''They do what they do and we will do what we do.''  But Mr. Bergstol was being disingenuous.  To design Pine Hill, Mr. Bergstol hired top  the golf-course consultant Tom Fazio, who also designed the short course at Pine Valley. Golfers shut out of private Pine Valley will no doubt flock to Pine Hill because of its  proximity and design pedigree.</p>
        <p>In addition, at the top of what was the ski hill, elevation 220 feet, which Mr. Bergstol claims is the highest point in South Jersey,  he is building a glassed-in clubhouse and restaurant. ''I'm hoping people will come just for the restaurant,'' he said. ''You won't be able to beat the view of Philadelphia and the golf course.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Bergstol won't divulge the price of the land and the yearlong construction, it is safe to say it is in the tens of millions of dollars. He said he hoped to have it paid back in five to seven years, but that he hoped his reputation as a top-flight builder would last far longer. ''The oldest golf courses are still around more than 100 years later,'' he said. ''I want to make money, certainly, but I also want to create something great. The way I look at it, designing golf courses is art with a bulldozer.''</p>
