        <p>AFTER 30 years of delays and false starts, this village has finally broken ground on a $100 million waterfront development that, its backers hope, will  enliven Port Chester's struggling downtown with a mix of retail, restaurants and movies and draw people from a wide geographic area.</p>
        <p>''Unlike some other waterfront developments, this one will really have an impact on the entire downtown,'' said Michael Murphy, the village manager. ''It will occupy almost half of the business district,'' Mr. Murphy said, on 27 acres along the Byram River.</p>

        <p>AFTER 30 years of delays and false starts, this village has finally broken ground on a $100 million waterfront development that, its backers hope, will  enliven Port Chester's struggling downtown with a mix of retail, restaurants and movies and draw people from a wide geographic area.</p>
        <p>''Unlike some other waterfront developments, this one will really have an impact on the entire downtown,'' said Michael Murphy, the village manager. ''It will occupy almost half of the business district,'' Mr. Murphy said, on 27 acres along the Byram River.</p>
        <p>The development, known as the Waterfront at Port Chester, will be a retail and entertainment complex that will include a 142,000-square-foot Costco Wholesale Club, a 67,000-square-foot Stop &amp; Shop supermarket, a 15-screen 85,000-square-foot multiplex cinema, a half-mile pedestrian promenade and 110 boat slips.</p>
        <p>There are also plans for an additional 140,000 square feet of retail space, said Gregg Wasser, a principal of G &amp; S Investors, based in Old Bethpage, N.Y., which is developing the project.</p>
        <p>''They'll be mom-and-pop-type operations that will be compatible with the major retailers, the movie theater and what already exists downtown,'' Mr. Wasser said. ''For instance, we plan to have a minimum number of restaurants because Port Chester already has almost 100 restaurants downtown and we don't want to compete with them.''</p>
        <p>Costco was the first to sign on. Next came Stop &amp; Shop, which had been searching for a Port Chester site for more than 10 years, according to Anthony Colavolpe, a vice president of real estate for the company. ''No other waterfront project got far enough to take seriously before this one,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Stop &amp; Shop has been active in Westchester, where it now has seven stores and as well as one under construction in Yonkers and one in North White Plains. Another store is also planned for White Plains, Mr. Colavolpe said.</p>
        <p>G &amp; S has also signed a contract with Loews to operate the 15-screen movie theater that is to be part of the project, Mr. Wasser said, but ''we still need to work out a lot of construction details with them.''</p>
        <p>The first phase of the project, which will include the Costco and the promenade park, is expected to be completed by next April, Mr. Wasser said. The next phase, which will involve the Stop &amp; Shop, the movie theater and the additional stores, is expected to be completed about eight months later.</p>
        <p>Evelyn Petrone, a member of the village zoning board, said that while she was basically happy with the project as envisioned, she was concerned that ''a movie theater with 15 screens is too much for the site.'' She added: ''I mean this is not a location that has great access off the highway. To get to it and the Costco, people will have to drive down Main Street or Midland Avenue, and that could be a problem.''</p>
        <p>To allay some of the village's traffic concerns, the developer plans to reconfigure more than 20 intersections, adding turning lanes and installing new coordinating traffic lights, Mr. Murphy said. ''These changes would have been needed even if the waterfront project wasn't built,'' he said. ''Those intersections have been problems for years. We just didn't have the funds to deal with it before.''</p>
        <p>The New York State Department of Transportation is providing $1.5 million for the road work. The project is also receiving financing from the county, in the form of yearly payments of up to $840,000. ''Every dollar the development generates above and beyond what it's currently generating comes back to the developer in the form of yearly payments,'' said Mark Weingarten, a lawyer for the developer. ''But the maximum the county would have to pay is $840,000 a year.''</p>
        <p>The developer estimates that the project, when fully operational, will generate more than $5 million in county sales tax and more than $8 million in state sales tax. ''The county stands to make a great deal of money from this project,'' Mr. Weingarten said. ''So we just asked them to give some of it back.''</p>
        <p>This type of financing formula is unusual for the county, according to Alan D. Scheinkman, the county attorney. ''It was appropriate in this case since villages don't collect sales tax revenue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Port Chester's downtown waterfront has been depressed and in need of rehabilitation for three decades, Mayor Christine Korff said. ''We just didn't have the money to do it ourselves,'' she said. In 1986, the village approved a $250 million project that included a 315,000-square-foot shopping center, 660 apartments, a 20-screen movie theater and a waterfront park and promenade. It was to be built by the Robert Martin Company but fell through due to a downturn in the real estate market, Mayor Korff said.</p>
        <p>BEFORE construction could begin on the new project, the developer had to relocate several businesses and residents from the targeted area, the mayor added. ''That's worked out very well,'' she said. ''We wanted the businesses to remain in the village if possible and most of them have been able to do so.''</p>
        <p>The developer said that his company had found new homes in the village for 65 of 82 families. ''We're still looking for places for the families that remain,'' Mr. Wasser said. His company pays each family $3,000 in moving expenses, along with $1,000 that is provided by the village.</p>
        <p>With numerous proposals advanced for the waterfront over the years, the mayor said that the village knew clearly what it wanted this time. ''We knew, for instance, that we didn't want any housing,'' she said. ''We already have a lot of high-density housing in the area and didn't want to overcrowd our schools.''</p>
        <p>The other criteria, the mayor added, was that the architecture fit in with the prevailing style of the village's downtown buildings. ''Even though these are nationally known retailers,'' Mayor Korff said, ''we wanted them to feel open to the public in style, in that they face the street and are broken up with architectural detailing. We didn't want them to look like big boxes.''</p>
        <p>Dal Pos Architects, of Syracuse, will be designing the project, with the exception of the Costco, which does its own design work. ''We're going to recreate the character of the downtown, but with a contemporary pickup,'' said Alfred H. Dal Pos, a member of the firm. ''The idea is to complement what's already there, not overwhelm it. This is a downtown project so it should fit into people's lives, and they should feel comfortable with it. It's not meant to stand apart.''</p>
