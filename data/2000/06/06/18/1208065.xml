        <p>Plowing the Dark</p>
        <p>By Richard Powers.</p>
        <p>415 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $25.</p>
        <p>Much of Richard Powers's new novel takes place inside two tiny rooms -- the first a place you'd be panicked to find yourself in, the second a place you'd never want to leave. At first glance, however, it would be hard to tell which room is which. One is a nondescript chamber where the primary amenities are a cheap mattress and an erratic radiator; the other space is equally generic, a windowless affair where every surface has been blanched institutional white.</p>
        <p>Though each room resembles a lousy Manhattan rental, these places are worlds apart. The first is a makeshift prison cell in Beirut where an American hostage named Taimur Martin finds himself shackled in solitary confinement -- and immersed in perpetual torment. The second is a virtual-reality laboratory in Seattle, nicknamed the Cavern, where thrilled, goggled visitors zoom over a forest canopy or float beneath the marble canopy of a cathedral.</p>
        <p>''Plowing the Dark'' is a novel of brute juxtaposition, a work that cross-cuts between these two disparate realms in order to draw connections between the virtual reality of cyberspace and the virtual reality of the human mind. Both places, it turns out, are screening rooms. Desperate to forestall succumbing to a ''gray-green, tidal emptiness'' during his years in captivity, Taimur casts mental projections on the paint-chipped walls of his cell that are just as ravishing as the bit-mapped images crafted by Adie Klarpol, the artist who lends the Cavern its lush, illusory textures. In the end, which is a more dazzling act of creation, Adie's digitized jungle, so convincing that its fake fronds leave real scratches on the adventurers scrolling through it, or Taimur's resurrection of his old Chicago neighborhood, in which his memory maps out ''every contiguous brick and block of concrete''?</p>
        <p>A fiercely visual book, ''Plowing the Dark'' sometimes feels less like a novel than the project of a stern museum curator. Locking you inside his private picture gallery -- the Seattle lab in one frame, the Beirut cell in the other -- Powers forces you to stare for hours, your eyes flitting back and forth in an attempt to fuse the stories of Taimur and Adie into a three-dimensional whole. Such a stereoscopic union is delayed until the final chapters of ''Plowing the Dark.'' When the two pictures finally do merge, the effect is spectacular. But like most special effects, it's an empty sort of razzle-dazzle.</p>
        <p>As singular as it sounds, ''Plowing the Dark'' heavily echoes its author's previous fictions, with their cleverly braided narratives and fascination with cutting-edge science. Most American novelists portray technology as scary stuff; they fill the sky with toxic clouds and screaming rockets. Powers's last novel, ''Gain,'' which glumly chronicled environmental damage in an industrial town, fell prey to such finger-wagging. But his best work -- like ''Galatea 2.2,'' in which some witty professors create a computer brainy enough to pass a literature exam -- finds beauty in the process of scientific inquiry. The laboratory is as central to Powers as the sitting room is to Jane Austen; he loves placing brilliant characters inside a fluorescent incubator, then watching ideas hatch on the page.</p>
        <p>Adie is a classic Powers character -- a former prodigy whose ideals have curdled into premature bitterness. (Think of Stuart Ressler, the young biologist in ''The Gold Bug Variations'' who falls apart when he fails to crack the code of human love.) A New York painter whose exquisite landscapes briefly captivated SoHo, Adie has since lost faith in her craft, resorting to hack illustration. But salvation beckons from Seattle. A friend cajoles her into visiting TeraSys, a digital graphics outfit on Puget Sound that needs a human hand to lend grace to its Photoshopped forms. During her tour, Adie steps into the Cavern -- first dismissing it as a ''glorified walk-in closet'' -- and tests a simulation called Crayon World. She is quickly transported to a nubby, colorful world where she cavorts alongside waxy honeybees, and her conversion is immediate: ''For the first time in as long as she cared to remember, the future held more pictures than the past.'' Joining TeraSys, Adie begins creating virtual-reality environments that make the first Cavern simulations look like Lascaux.</p>
        <p>With the help of some hackers who subsist on Doritos (and indulge in the kind of sardonic wordplay that typically sets a Powers lab humming), Adie creates a program transforming Henri Rousseau's 1910 painting ''The Dream'' into a rain forest filled with ripe fruit and rustling leaves. This feat is meant to be thrilling, and it almost is. Powers does his florid best to make the moment feel magical -- Dreamlike bananas floated up to tickle the insouciant moon'' -- but his prose-poem riffs never fully take flight, not even when Adie giddily tosses Botticelli's Venus into her jungle. With all the precious art-historical references, the effect is none too trippy. Instead of the pulsing energy of ''The Matrix,'' Powers offers the staid alchemy of ''Sunday in the Park With George.'' Other TeraSys simulations are similarly stuffy. One researcher develops a pictogram charting the impact of oil prices on geopolitics; the effect is less like crawling into a Cavern than plunging into a think tank.</p>
        <p>So maybe Powers is too highbrow to provide a Hollywood rush. Then again, he's simultaneously out to revel in high-tech wizardry and deflate it. In a key chapter, Adie belatedly ventures out to explore real-world Seattle. Walking through the ''afternoon-soaked streets,'' she senses the limits of the digital: ''Nothing we make will ever match sunlight.'' Nonetheless, Adie pursues her pixilated craft, moving on to create a simulation of Van Gogh's bedroom in Arles -- a sun-dappled Mediterranean refuge that contrasts poignantly with the sunless Mediterranean prison of Taimur Martin.</p>
        <p>Taimur is a 33-year-old English teacher who flees a failed romance in Chicago for expatriate solitude in Lebanon -- and within weeks is kidnapped by Islamic fundamentalists. Taimur's harrowing narrative of decline urgently interrupts the story of Adie's creative ascent. Whereas the TeraSys chapters of ''Plowing the Dark'' have an effete air, the Beirut sections ruthlessly convey one man's physical collapse and mental breakdown. These sections contain the most visceral prose Powers has ever written, and they are written in the second person -- You lie huddled on your mattress under the cheap acrylic blanket, shivering in the slip glaze of your own sweat'' -- making the reader a hostage to Taimur's sufferings.</p>
        <p>This rhetorical gambit is a nod to the first virtual-reality games, adventures that used only words glowing on a screen to conjure imaginary worlds. (''You are facing east. A dragon belches fire in your direction. What should you do?'') Though deeply ironic, Powers's strategy does not trivialize his subject. Taimur's captivity is clearly not a game -- even if the language of computer games can best weld the reader to his plight.</p>
        <p>When Taimur is not running in a ''shrunken oval'' around his radiator for exercise, he seeks the only liberation he can -- mental escape. He dredges up entire scenes from ''Great Expectations.'' He spins new endings to the stories that his Iranian mother used to tell him. In fact, Taimur gets so pulled into his past that when a gunshot pierces the metal covering his window, he's unable to process fresh data. ''You stand and put your pupil into the torn tin corona. Through the peephole, an unfathomable universe. . . . It refuses to cohere beyond pure sensation -- an ornate, deep-pile Persian rug tied by child fingers.''</p>
        <p>So intense is Taimur's narrative that it threatens to capsize Powers's counterpoint structure. TeraSys' egghead entertainments simply can't match Taimur's fever dreams. The last chapters of ''Plowing the Dark'' make a daring effort to restore equilibrium. After Taimur passes 1,001 days in his cell, he starts running out of stories. In suicidal defeat, he smashes his head against the wall, losing consciousness (''You look down into the abyss, give up your grip, and drop''). Then something astonishing happens: Taimur suddenly finds himself walking inside a Byzantine cathedral -- one identical to a Cavern simulation that Adie has been building in Seattle. At the same moment, Adie herself enters the Cavern and soars to her cathedral's dome. Then she looks down.</p>
        <p>This collision of Taimur's world with Adie's is riveting, yet it also feels like a sentimental feint. Does Powers really believe we're headed toward an era where ''every soul in the world'' will serve ''as every other soul's 24-hour server''? The emotional power of Taimur's story derives from the fact that his sole consolation lies within his own skull; to provide an escape hatch feels dishonest. Virtual-reality companies may generate fantasies we all can share, but the virtual reality of the mind will forever admit one customer. In the end, ''Plowing the Dark'' succeeds as spectacle, but it's not intellectually satisfying. That's something I never expected of Richard Powers.</p>
