        <p>THE TIME BIKE. By Jane Langton. HarperCollins. $15.95. (Ages 9 to 12) In addition to Walden Pond, Concord, Mass., is home to the eccentric Hall family, which has had some remarkable adventures in a series of novels. This time it's Eddy, whose bright red 21-speed birthday bicycle disappears. In its place, a Transcendental Transport truck delivers an old-fashioned one-speed number that can travel through time, with a Time Clock on the handlebars that goes forward and backward. Great fun.</p>
        <p>RED RUBBER BOOT DAY. By Mary Lyn Ray. Illustrated by Lauren Stringer. Harcourt. $16. (Ages 3 to 7) The young narrator likes doing indoor things on rainy days, and then going outside in his red boots. Mr. Humphrey next door gets to stand on the grass barefoot, which is clearly fun, but splashing in boots is better.</p>

        <p>RED RUBBER BOOT DAY. By Mary Lyn Ray. Illustrated by Lauren Stringer. Harcourt. $16. (Ages 3 to 7) The young narrator likes doing indoor things on rainy days, and then going outside in his red boots. Mr. Humphrey next door gets to stand on the grass barefoot, which is clearly fun, but splashing in boots is better.</p>
        <p>KITE. By Melvin Burgess. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $16. (Ages 10 to 14) From the author of ''Smack'' comes an accessible and engrossing tale of moral choice in what to American readers may be an exotic setting -- a great British hunting estate where pheasants are bred for shooting. Taylor's father is a gamekeeper, and the boy collects eggs. At issue are the eggs of the rare kite, an endangered species but one the hunters consider mere predatory vermin.</p>
        <p>ONE LUCKY GIRL. By George Ella Lyon. Illustrated by Irene Trivas. Richard Jackson/DK Ink. $15.95. (Ages 5 to 8) The true story of Becky's ''baby summer,'' when the family was living in a trailer at the racetrack. The narrator, Becky's brother, tells how a tornado swept through the grounds and took the baby on ''the wildest ride of her life.''</p>
        <p>ONE LIGHTHOUSE, ONE MOON. Written and illustrated by Anita Lobel. Greenwillow. $15.95. (Ages 3 to 8) The world is filled with so many things to count and so many ways to count them. Here are three sequences, delightfully illustrated. First, the days of the week: one color for each, noted by a cat who admires a little girl's matching skirts and shoes, from pink ballet slippers to red cowboy boots. Then a month-by-month calendar of the same cat's year; finally, a pure number sequence involving one lighthouse, one moon, the sea and its surroundings.</p>
        <p>DILLY-DALLY AND THE NINE SECRETS. By Elizabeth MacDonald. Illustrated by Ken Brown. Dutton. $15.99. (Ages 3 to 5) Here's another kind of counting book, this one postcard bucolic. Dilly-Dally Duck sits in the reeds by the side of a pretty pond as the neighbors and their babies come by, but Dilly-Dally won't abandon her secrets. There's a heron and her chick, a beaver and her kittens, a swan and her cygnets. Guess Dilly-Dally's surprise.</p>
        <p>OPEN WIDE: Tooth School Inside. Written and illustrated by Laurie Keller. Holt. $16.95. (Ages 4 to 8) Since ''The Scrambled States of America'' was a hilarious and effective geography lesson, it shouldn't be astonishing that Dr. Flossman and his 32 pupils offer a lesson about teeth that is both entertaining and amusing. Wacky illustrations and a quiz at the end. Brush. Floss. Brush.</p>
        <p>SOMETHING'S HAPPENING ON CALABASH STREET. By Judith Ross Enderle and Stephanie Jacob Gordon. Illustrated by Donna Ingemanson. Chronicle. $14.95. (Ages 5 to 9) Mischa wonders what's going on when the whole neighborhood seems to be shopping and chopping. The answer is a food fair, and there are 13 recipes for the different families' favorite dishes, for children to help make or prepare themselves.</p>
