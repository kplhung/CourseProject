        <p>At a busy crossroads here, four townships meet. So does the New School of Monmouth County. Now, much to the consternation of parents and teachers at the tiny red Cape Cod-style school building, a new 7-Eleven convenience store looms.</p>
        <p>To the Southland Corporation of Dallas, the parent company of 7-Eleven, what struck its acquisitions team was the brisk traffic that passed through this intersection of Laurel Avenue (Route 516) and Middle Road.</p>
        <p>There is already a 7-Eleven less than two miles away in this town of 14,000, where homes range from modest dwellings on the east side of town -- where the school is situated -- to sprawling sections of luxury town houses and condominiums in the half-million-dollar range. Go a block in any of the four directions here and a driver is in either Holmdel, Hazlet, Middletown or Keansburg.</p>
        <p>''That's just the point,'' said Margaret Chabris, a spokeswoman for Southland. ''It's almost two miles from the nearest convenience store. It would be a benefit to that community. We saw that traffic and knew it would be a very strong location for us. We know what the concerns of the school and residents are and we have been more than willing to address them. We have scaled the store down and added a plan for a buffer and leaving specimen trees.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Chabris added: ''We have worked with the school and the residents every step of the way on this to make this work. At least I hope we have. That's what we normally do.''</p>
        <p>But Susan Chilvers, the educational director the New School who has fought the corporation since the proposal was first made public last June, had one word to say: ''Rubbish.''</p>
        <p>Then Ms. Chilvers had more to say, ''We got one letter from their real estate manager -- and it was a form letter at that.''</p>
        <p>She said that since the convenience store was proposed about a year ago, school board members and residents had written to Southland but had received no response.</p>
        <p>In letters to Southland, members of the the community -- including some students -- described their play yard and garden, places to contemplate, discuss and study. They emphasized that they did not want their peaceful world to overlook a crowded parking lot and Dumpsters.</p>
        <p>As for the teachers and parents, they said in the letters they did not want to worry about foot traffic from the new store to the public park on the other side of the school. Nor did they want to worry about a 24-hour business luring traffic and encouraging people to loiter.</p>
        <p>For a year the children, parents and teachers have rallied residents to fight the store, enlisting the help of Connie Dobilas, who owns the P and P Sweet Shoppe. Together they have gathered 1,000 signatures on a petition to stop a change in zoning that would allow Southland to build the 7-Eleven.</p>
        <p>The area is zoned for low-impact businesses like the 30-year-old sweet shop, a luncheonette and newsstand across the street and a nearby dance studio and auto repair shop.</p>
        <p>Although the board was to hear more public comment and vote on the variance last Wednesday, Southland's attorney, Michael Bruno of Middletown, requested a postponement until July 12 because only six of the seven members were present. Five votes are necessary for passage of the variance.</p>
        <p>About 100 protesters showed up at the hearing, and some volunteered to begin a community fund to buy the land. ''This is the best thing that could have happened for us,'' Ms. Chilvers said.</p>
        <p>Before last week's hearing, Ms. Tobias of the sweet shop said of her possible competition: ''People here aren't thrilled. Sure it'll hurt us, our business. But after a year of fighting this big corporation, it's everyone's morale that's hurt. Keeping up people's spirits when their own town doesn't take care of them or look out for them. That hurts more.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Bruno said: ''I know they say the neighborhood is against this, but since that petition was not admissible to the board they can't prove it. It just looks like self-interested business owners and a few kids and parents want their way and can't have it.''</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, about 150 local residents gathered to protest on the empty lot, forming a human chain around the site of the proposed store.</p>
        <p>''Who do they think is going to buy from them?'' asked 11-year-old Lucy Goldberg of Freehold, who attends the school. ''Who do they think buys Slurpees?''</p>
        <p>The students here have been raised with a Montessori-like system of free-choice learning, where they can go to class barefoot and make their own decisions about when and how they study. The school believes in individual responsibility and a community voice in government decision-making.</p>
        <p>Since Southland does not own the land but plans to lease it, people here still hope they can somehow make the owner of the property a better offer. According to Mr. Bruno, the land is owned by Marie Cerlione, who plans to sell the property to Richard Brunelli of South Amboy. Mrs. Cerlione declined to discuss the sale of the property.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brunelli said: ''Except for a technicality the property was zoned commercial. These so-called protests show no respect for the property owner's rights in a capitalistic society.''</p>
        <p>Before last week's hearing, Mayor Gary Aumiller said: ''I really wish I could comment on this one. But the township's attorney has advise me and the zoning board members that we can't talk because the matter could be appealed.''</p>
        <p>The point was not lost on 13-year-old Kendra Waters of Cliftwood Beach, who has been a student at the school for eight years. ''If one board says it's over, that's not the end,'' Kendra said. ''The garden is one of my favorite things about the school. It's not going to be the same with all those cars and dumpster and traffic next door.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Chablis of Southland said: ''Others who have protested other locations have come to love us. I'm sure that will be the case here. It's up to the powers that be in the town. I'm sure we can work something out to the school's benefit.''</p>
