        <p>Most hands-on gardeners have a dirty little secret, and it's hiding under the shrubs. The secret is weeds, self-sown tree seedlings, and poison ivy, all of which have a habit of springing up, especially after a rainy spell.</p>
        <p>The problem is that this unwanted vegetation is thoroughly camouflaged and usually goes unnoticed until it is well-rooted.</p>
        <p>To stop trouble before it starts, you can do one of two things: plant a ground cover under the shrubs, or cover the earth with a layer of newspaper or landscaping fabric topped with a layer of decorative mulch. Hosta makes an effective player in under-the-shrub scenes. For something closer to the ground, try a good-natured low-lying plant such as Lamium. A creeping groundcover beats a garden thug every time.</p>
