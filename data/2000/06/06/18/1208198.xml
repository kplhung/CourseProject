        <p>TUXEDO PARK reminds Paula Tocci of Lake Garda in northern Italy. For Sharon McHugh, gazing out at the Ramapo Mountains surrounding Tuxedo Lake evokes memories of the Lake District in her native England. Like so many other Tuxedo Park residents, both women were smitten the instant they drove through the stately stone gate and along the winding lake drive of this historic village in Orange County, N.Y., about 40 miles from Midtown.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tocci, the president of a project-management company that works with architects, recalled her first look at the lake:  ''I said: 'That's it. I'll beg, borrow or steal to live here.' '' Sixteen years ago, she bought a 7,000-square-foot carriage house built in 1888, which is still in the midst of renovation. Although her commute by car to Manhattan has grown longer because of increased traffic, she considers Tuxedo Park a sanctuary from the hectic pace elsewhere.</p>
        <p>There is no leash law in the village, so dogs roam free. There are no stores, no gas stations, no movie theaters -- they are prohibited by zoning regulations -- and no gas-powered motorboats are allowed on any of the three lakes -- Tuxedo, Wee Wah and Little Wee Wah.</p>
        <p>The gate is guarded 24 hours a day by members of the village's own police force who allow only the 900 or so residents and their guests entry. There are no house numbers -- yet another throwback to a bygone era -- so visitors need to know where they're going. Crime is virtually nonexistent, and residents often don't bother locking their doors.</p>
        <p>Tuxedo Park, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was built in 1886 by  Pierre Lorillard, the tobacco heir, as a hunting and fishing retreat for his wealthy New York friends. Considered one of the finest examples of pre-World War I architecture in the United States, Tuxedo Park has always been an enclave for the rich. Emily Post, the daughter of the Bruce Price, the architect for the gatehouse and the first 13  houses in Tuxedo Park, grew up here, and Mark Twain summered here.</p>
        <p>Many of the grand old mansions have changed hands in recent years, and prices are escalating. ''In the last five years there's been a huge increase in prices,'' said Cindy Van Schaack, the owner of Towne and Country Properties in the Town of Tuxedo, which surrounds Tuxedo Park. ''The problem now is that inventory is very low. Ten years ago I had a dozen premier estates between 12,000 and 20,000 square feet on Tuxedo Lake. Two years ago there were eight. And now there's nothing.''</p>
        <p>There are about 330 houses in Tuxedo Park and two buildings with a total of 13 apartments. The village, incorporated in 1952, covers 2,086 acres. About a third of the properties are valued at $500,000 or less, according to Christian R. Sonne, the official historian of the Town of Tuxedo and a broker with TPA Realty, and those tend to be converted stables or restored gardener's cottages on small lots.</p>
        <p>THE least expensive house on the market now, a restored 2,200-square-foot carriage house, is priced at $485,000. About 40 percent of the houses are in the $500,000-to-$1-million range, and the remainder are valued at $1 million to $3.5 million.</p>
        <p>One of the largest homes in Tuxedo Park is Chastellux (pronounced SHAS-tuh-loo), a  27,000-square-foot mansion in the French  chateau style on 8.2 lakefront acres. It has 46 rooms, 15 fireplaces, a lily pond, teahouse, orchard and boat dock. It was sold two years ago for $2.45 million.</p>
        <p>A proposed development on 600 acres outside the village gate in the Town of Tuxedo has some residents of Tuxedo Park worried. Although the 1,375 units -- a mix of condominiums, town houses and single-family homes -- would be well outside the village, fears of overcrowding persist.</p>
        <p>''Development is good for the Town of Tuxedo, but there's no way the town can handle the traffic that will come out of there,'' said Katherine Norris, the owner of Tuxedo Park Estates, a real estate brokerage company, who grew up in Tuxedo Park.</p>
        <p>The character of the village is changing in other ways. In recent years, more young families have moved in than ever before. ''It used to be a lot of seniors,'' said Cornelius J. J. Madera, a 20-year resident and the mayor of Tuxedo Park for the last 10 years. ''In the last five years, there has been a proliferation of people in their 30's with young children. There are a large number of investment bankers, mutual-fund managers, some high-profile dot-com people.''  About a third of the village's residents also have apartments in Manhattan, and many  use Tuxedo Park as a weekend retreat.</p>
        <p>Celebrities are also drawn here by the beauty and the promise of privacy. Whoopi Goldberg and Barry Bostwick of ''Spin City'' live here, and so, until recently, did Greg Anthony, the former Knick. Cyndi Lauper used to rent a house in Tuxedo Park in the summers, when she could be seen,  green hair and all, playing pool at a bar just outside the gate.</p>
        <p>Although housing prices may be steep, comparable properties in, say, Scarsdale, N.Y., or Greenwich, Conn., can cost five times as much, Ms. Van Schaack said. That is in part because of Tuxedo Park's isolation, and the fact that it was a well-kept secret for so long. For years, Ms. Van Schaack said, real estate brokers did very little advertising. ''People liked it that way,'' she added. ''They were very protective.''</p>
        <p>Tuxedo Park is also not as accessible to Manhattan as Scarsdale or Greenwich, because there is no direct train service. Short Line buses make the run to the Port Authority terminal in about an hour.</p>
        <p>Shopping can be a chore. There is a small IGA grocery store in the Town of Tuxedo, but for a greater selection, residents have to drive to supermarkets in Monroe, N.Y., or Mahwah, N.J. The Woodbury Commons outlet mall is a 15-minute drive away, and many residents travel 30 minutes to shop at the Paramus Mall in northern New Jersey. Fine dining is at least a 20-minute drive away. Unlike many upscale suburban towns, there is no Gap, no Starbucks, no movie theater nearby.</p>
        <p>Sharon McHugh believes the tradeoffs are worth it. She moved with her husband and three children from Madison, N.J., last summer, and while the shopping is inconvenient, ''it's no worse than battling Madison's traffic,'' she said. She's also been driving her children around less, because they can now ride bikes everywhere safely.</p>
        <p>Most residents send their children to the Tuxedo Park School, a private school housed in a 1915 mansion by Carrere &amp; Hastings, the same architectural firm that  designed the New York Public Library. The school has prekindergarten through the ninth grade. Class sizes are 16 students in the lower grades and 18 in grades four through nine. Tuition ranges from $9,000 for the all-day prekindergarten to $16,400 for the seventh, eighth and ninth grades.</p>
        <p>''About two-thirds of our students go on to very competitive boarding schools,'' said James Burger, the headmaster.</p>
        <p>The school has a strong commitment to technology, with computers in all classrooms in addition to those in the library research center and computer labs. At lunchtime, teachers and administrators eat  with the students family-style, then the children clear the tables. The school's ''no-cut'' policy allows any student to participate in sports, choruses and plays.</p>
        <p>Tuxedo Park residents can also send their children to Tuxedo public schools, and 34 students from Tuxedo Park are currently enrolled in the town's elementary school and high school, according to Joseph Zanetti, the superintendent of the Tuxedo Union Free School District.</p>
        <p>The George Grant Mason Elementary School's fourth grade scored highest in the Orange County this year on the English Language Arts tests; 92 percent of the students passed, compared with 62 percent last year.</p>
        <p>AVERAGE class size in the district is 18 students. Both the elementary and high school emphasize technology, with one computer for every four students.</p>
        <p>Eighty-five percent of the seniors who are about to graduate from the high school this year will go on to college. Last year's average SAT scores were 560 in math and 540 in verbal, compared with 502 in math and 495 in verbal statewide.</p>
        <p>One of the big attractions of Tuxedo Park is the abundance of hiking, biking and riding paths within the compound. The lakes are stocked with trout and bass for fishing, and swimming is allowed in the two smaller lakes, Wee Wah and Little Wee Wah.</p>
        <p>The Tuxedo Club, a private country club with about 500 members, has a Robert Trent Jones golf course, pool, boathouse and an unusual array of racquet sports: lawn tennis, paddle tennis, squash, racquets and court tennis (one of only nine courts in the country). About a third of the members are  are Tuxedo Park residents; the initiation fee for those over 40 is about $20,000 and yearly dues are about $5,500.</p>
        <p>Although Tuxedo Park used to have the reputation of being snobbish, that's no longer true, Mayor Madera contends. ''People are extremely friendly,'' he said. '' We have something called the 'Park sweep.' If you're  having a party, you invite virtually everyone in the Park to your house.''</p>
        <p>Michael LaRocca, a New York interior designer, sold his house in East Hampton and moved to Tuxedo Park two years ago  after tiring of crowded Hamptons restaurants and the long weekend commute from Manhattan. He was surprised to get a call two weeks after moving in from a neighbor he had never met.</p>
        <p>''She said she and her husband wanted to give me a party and invited 40 or 50 people from the Park,'' Mr. LaRocca recalled. ''Three weeks later they had this amazing dinner for me, with caviar and champagne, and I met people there I've become good friends with. That never happened to me in the Hamptons.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Tocci, who has lived in Tuxedo Park for 16 years, likes the fact that people just drop by to say hello, and that her two children are never at a loss for someone to play with. ''I never know if I should set the table for three or for six,'' she said. ''Tuxedo Park is full of surprises.''</p>
