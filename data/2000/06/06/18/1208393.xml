        <p>JOAN PHILLIPS had seen it before. A small town that once prospered on the rolling Iowa countryside, unable to adjust to a changing economy, loses population and most of its businesses. It gradually experiences a kind of living death, marked by peeling paint and an aging population.</p>
        <p>Yet Ms. Phillips, a 65-year-old retired insurance agent, and a group of her neighbors were determined not to let that happen here in Manning, a town of 1,400 about 100 miles west of Des Moines. In the last five years, Ms. Phillips and her neighbors, by joining town boards and promoting referenda, have pushed Manning to tap money from the city's publicly owned utilities, the sale of bonds and low-interest loans from the state and federal government.</p>
        <p>The city has used the proceeds to give its Main Street an $850,000 facelift. It is in the midst of a $4.5 million expansion of the local hospital and the adjoining nursing home and has poured an additional $880,000 into its local schools, in part to upgrade computers and Internet access.</p>
        <p>But the most important action, Ms. Phillips said, was a 1996 decision by 86 percent of the city's voters to issue $3.5 million in bonds to set up a locally owned local telephone service to compete with the long-time operator, the GTE Corporation. The service, the Manning Municipal Communication and Television Systems Utility, now provides residents with cable television, high-speed Internet connections and, starting later this summer, improved telephone services, including voice mail, three-way calling, speed dialing and call forwarding, that have not been available.</p>
        <p>These telecommunications services, Ms. Phillips said, would have arrived only slowly, if at all, from GTE. ''Their attitude was to let the small town go and die,'' suggested Ms. Phillips, who has served for 12 years as coordinator for the Manning Area Development Corporation, a local nonprofit group that works closely with state and federal agencies. ''It doesn't fit into their business plan. For them it's a business issue. For us it's about a way of life.''</p>
        <p>A GTE spokesman, Don Neely, denied that his company served rural communities like Manning poorly.  But he said that the company had been trying to unload many of its rural lines, including those in Iowa, to invest in wireless services and other new ventures.</p>
        <p>GTE's impending sale of its largely rural lines across the state to the smaller Iowa Telecom -- expected to be completed later this summer -- has exacerbated the sense of urgency among communities in the state about positioning themselves to meet the challenges of the digital age.</p>
        <p>IOWA, like other states, has been promoting the Internet as a rural development tool. The state has some strong advantages, notably its educated population, generally excellent public schools and the absence of crime and other more urban ills. Yet hopes that the Internet can help revive the state's rural communities have not widely materialized.</p>
        <p>For the most part, said Peter F. Korsching, a sociologist at Iowa State University, the winners in Iowa's emerging new economy have not been small towns, but rather larger urban centers like Cedar Rapids and Des Moines, which serve as major switching centers for telecommunications and boast the best airport and highway connections. The state's two major college towns, Ames and Iowa City, also have done  well, drawing on local graduates and  well-educated residents.</p>
        <p>''The population is coming back in growth centers, while rural Iowa is shrinking,'' noted Mr. Korsching, who is co-author, with Eric A. Abbott and Patricia C. Hipple, of ''Having All the Right Connections: Telecommunications and Rural Economic Viability,'' to be published by Praeger next month. ''We have islands of prosperity where Internet-related jobs are clustering.''</p>
        <p>Another, somewhat less prototypical standout has been Fairfield, a city of 15,000 that is home to Maharishi University. Fairfield boasts among the highest number of Internet domain names per capita of any community in the nation, one indication of the density of Web activity. Local people trace the area's successful telecommunications business to the presence of thousands of adherents of transcendental meditation, among them many well-educated migrants from major cities, who have been instrumental in starting Internet and other businesses related to high technology.</p>
        <p>Mr. Korsching said that for many rural communities, the rise of the Internet and the digital economy resembles something closer to ''information Armageddon'' than salvation. These areas, he said, have remained dependent on agriculture at a time when the economics of farming has changed drastically. The rise of ever larger corporate farms, he noted, combined with the ability to buy on the Internet, has reduced the role of smaller towns as vital trading areas.</p>
        <p>As a result, roughly 78 percent of Iowa's counties -- like Carroll, the home of Manning -- have lost population since 1900, according to Bruce Babcock, an Iowa State University economist. This is largely a result of the 1930's Dust Bowl and more recently the industrialization and consolidation of agriculture. Some small towns, like Grand Junction in Greene County just to the east, have Main Streets that are largely abandoned.</p>
        <p>The decay can be seen as what a state economist, Harvey Seigelman, has called the ''Dakotaization'' of small-town Iowa. Ultimately, Mr. Seigelman and other observers agree, there will be a painful reshuffling of Iowa's rural geography, with a handful of communities prospering while a large number of small towns virtually disappear.</p>
        <p>That is the prospect that haunts Manning's leading citizens and businesspeople. Although the town looks prosperous enough, per capita income remains as much as $5,000  below that of more urbanized areas of the state. The town's population has also fallen, having peaked at 2,200 in 1920. It has also been aging rapidly, with its school-age population dropping from 800 to 550 since the 1970's.</p>
        <p>''We're in danger of becoming a totally middle-aged community,'' said Howard Roe, senior vice president of the First National Bank of Manning and one of the leaders of the revitalization efforts. ''We have to create opportunities for younger people here. ''</p>
        <p>Manning's investment in infrastructure, particularly telecommunications, may yet be able to stem the decline, said Rick Haunsacker, executive director of Region XII Council of Governments, a development agency for six counties, including  Greene and Carroll. ''A lot of it has to do with the culture. In Manning, people are willing to open their pockets and use public funds to save their communities. In other places, they don't do that.''</p>
        <p>That spirit clearly drives people like Joan Phillips, who says Manning has many advantages -- a low cost of living, good schools and a disciplined, literate and motivated work force -- attractive to information-age industries. The city's expanding telecommunications net, she said, has persuaded Enterprise Corporation International, a Des Moines-based company that offers technical support and software for Sony and other electronics manufacturers, to double the size of its current 28-person staff in town.</p>
        <p>''This offers a real chance for us,''  said Brenda Steck, the company's local manager, who finished Manning High School in 1983. ''Of the people I graduated from high school with,  only 10 or so stayed. I'm hoping this kind of industry will bring people back -- and keep people here.''</p>
