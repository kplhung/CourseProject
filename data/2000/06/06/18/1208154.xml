        <p>WENDY WHELAN is the most American of ballerinas. Tall and thin, unself-consciously inscrutable and seemingly unstoppable, the New York City Ballet principal dances with a tangy lack of adornment that is seldom found in Europe. Hers is an odd but potent glamour.</p>
        <p>Unglamourously dependable, however, Ms. Whelan has kept dancing this season through the injuries and illnesses that have plagued both City Ballet and American Ballet Theater. Take any performance at the New York State Theater and she is likely to be on the program in more than one role. But she is also something of a mystery, a quintessentially American colt of a dancer who has suddenly grown into a ballerina of new depth and dramatic power.</p>
        <p>Off the stage, Ms. Whelan, who is 33, seems less mysterious and less impervious to the wear and tear of a career in ballet. Cheerfully self-deprecating, she laughs frequently when talking of a life in dance that started with childhood training in her native Louisville and continued at the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet in New York, culminating in her acceptance into City Ballet in 1986. She was made a soloist in 1989 and two years later was named a principal.</p>
        <p>Over the years Ms. Whelan has accumulated a wide range of roles, some of them created for her, in ballets by Jerome Robbins, Peter Martins and visiting choreographers like Ulysses Dove, Twyla Tharp and Christopher d'Amboise, who has cast her as a central dancer in his new ''Triptych.''</p>
        <p>It is easy to imagine that George Balanchine, who died in 1983, would have been intrigued by Ms. Whelan's fearless appetite for space and the clarity and technical ease and efficiency of her dancing. She has danced principal parts in about 30 of his ballets, in signature roles ranging from Titania and other leads in Balanchine's fairy-tale ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' to the central pas de deux in his spare and edgy ''Agon.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Whelan began ballet classes at 3. Her interest was piqued not long after when she played a mouse in the Louisville Ballet production of ''The Nutcracker.'' ''They had a lot of big dancers,'' she says. ''The real thing. So to be backstage was great.''</p>
        <p>She went on to a fondly remembered period of ''British''-style training under Alun Jones, who now directs the Louisville Ballet. One teacher, Robert Dicello, became a beloved mentor to Ms. Whelan, quietly preparing her for the day when she would leave for New York and its ballet companies.</p>
        <p>Ms. Whelan left at 14 for a summer scholarship at the School of American Ballet. Back in Louisville for her first year of high school, she prepared herself for an eventual life in New York by switching from parochial school to a public school where she knew, she said, that ''there would be a little bit of everybody.''</p>
        <p>When she returned to New York, it was to stay. As a full-time student at the School of American Ballet, she approached her training with such nervous intensity that at one point she was asked to consider taking a summer off. Unbeknownst to her, at least one teacher understood that this gawky tangle of bones had what it took to become a gifted ballerina. But that message was never transmitted to Ms. Whelan, who remembers being singled out in class by the same teacher as not ready for a corps role in the annual school performances.</p>
        <p>''At least she's thinking of that,'' Ms. Whelan told herself staunchly, adding that next year she would ''be there.''  ''I always needed to get a little tougher,'' she said. ''And all these things I took and made them positive, somehow. I remember Robert saying to me that I would be O.K. because I was someone who didn't know the word no. He wasn't going to worry about me.''</p>
        <p>Ask Ms. Whelan about favorite roles and she talks of favorite partners and scores, though she describes herself as not particularly musical. The few full-evening story ballets that City Ballet performs are a special challenge in a company without that tradition. ''I keep reminding myself that the reward is in the experience,'' she says. ''The time you spent building is where you really get your gift, because you'll always have that approaching the next hurdle.''</p>
        <p>In the early 1990's, Ms. Whelan began to focus more consciously on developing her work, studying with a teacher, Wilhelm Burmann, whom she describes as ''very involved with taking everything a little further.'' Then, about two years ago, the world she had planned so carefully fell apart.</p>
        <p>''My family exploded,'' she said a little reluctantly. ''My love life exploded. And I had no one to turn to because it was all happening at the same time. I had to refocus everything that I relied on. People. My place here in the company.'' City Ballet administrators sensed her turmoil and offered her a leave of absence. But work, she found, was cathartic: ''I found new people, and a new part of myself, I think, with that. But it was really, really painful. At the same time, now, all those things that had so much pain are flowering in a different way. I had to feed myself, so I had to find the fuel I needed.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Whelan was once a natural Hippolyta, the Amazon Queen who surges with her hounds through ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' Now, imbued with the gift of resonant stillness, she is an equally natural distillation of romantic love in the ballet's exquisite second-act divertissement.</p>
        <p>''That was Jock! Jock Soto!'' Ms. Whelan volunteers, describing Mr. Soto, a frequent partner in the pas de deux, as the backbone that allows a ballerina to feel safe enough to do more.</p>
        <p>She talks of turning 30 and also seems to be commenting on the turns her life has taken: ''I was so happy. I was a woman now. I had earned this. If you've worked for something, you've earned it. It doesn't just come to you for free. That has always been important to me.''</p>
