        <p>IT is obvious that New London is a city on the rise. Its downtown, like that of many American cities, had become a sort of wasteland, but it is gaining an around-the-clock population and the amenities that go with it.

        <p>IT is obvious that New London is a city on the rise. Its downtown, like that of many American cities, had become a sort of wasteland, but it is gaining an around-the-clock population and the amenities that go with it. An especially visible sign of the city's new confidence is an ambitious outdoor exhibition, ''Sculpture 2000.''</p>
        <p>The show was the idea of Mary Ellen Jukoski, the president of Mitchell College in New London. One of the major areas of study offered by the college is education, and a special feature of the show was the participation of schoolchildren from the New London area in early stages of the exhibition. They visited the works as they were going up and talked with the artists. The grounds of Mitchell College front the Thames River and eight pieces are installed there. Some take advantage of the watery backdrop.</p>
        <p>The exhibition is given a special character by the presence of works by artists from six countries. Sam Gejdenson, the area's Congressman, and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, was able to use his office to ease the participation of artists from Colombia, India, Israel, Morocco, Russia and South Africa.</p>
        <p>At Mitchell College, Sylvia Benitez, a New York artist, has created what might be the exhibition's mascot. New London was a major whaling center in the 18th and 19th centuries, and Ms. Benitez commemorates this with ''Nin-e-veh,'' a 30-foot stylized and angular whale made of strips of red cedar that hang separately from a triangular framework. When wind riffles the slats the creature's presence is announced all over the grounds.</p>
        <p>Sol LeWitt, one of five Connecticut artists participating, is known primarily for murals featuring bright color or cerebral, geometric sculpture. His dense ''Irregular Procession'' is a massing of towers of various heights made of cinder blocks stacked on end. The city of Groton is across the river from the college and Mr. Lewitt's industrial-looking work might be an acknowledgment that Groton is home to many manufacturers.</p>
        <p>David Smalley's wiry ''Harbor Light'' is placed at the edge of the water; it contains fiber optics and glows blue at night. Alvin Sher, who headed the selection committee for ''Sculpture 2000,'' made an especially thin version of a classical temple but out of aluminum. ''Oculus'' has the expected circular opening in its modified dome to permit light to come in and travel around the piece; its base is decorated with signs of the zodiac.</p>
        <p>Ephraim Peleg's work featuring rock suspended from a skeletal framework is called ''David's Stone'' in reference to the weapon used against Goliath, and perhaps to combat in general.</p>
        <p>Christopher Wynter's ''Migration,'' a large head resting in a sort of pod on a cart-like structure with large wheels, might allude to the influx of ideas brought in by the show's non-American artists.</p>
        <p>A second site for sculptures is firmly on dry land, Veterans Memorial Park, a plaza in downtown New London.</p>
        <p>''Black Trunk,'' a leafless tree devised by Mel Kendrick, is a sculpture in the round composed of six irregularly shaped bronze rings joined together. The spaces between the elements are not disguised, for Mr. Kendrick likes to remind his audience of the process of a sculpture's construction. The trunk has no branches and so would be inhospitable to the other black bronze work in Veterans Memorial Park: ''Gorilla,'' by Daisy Youngblood. It is a life-size small gorilla with a vital presence, but because the animal's arms and legs are so massive and prominent, the sculpture has a firmly planted look, something like that of a Calder stabile.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the sculpture of Moroccan artist Abdelkrim El Ouazzani is spindly and had to be put indoors in a nearby building to protect it from the ubiquitous wind. What ''Metal et Technique,'' featuring a tall bicycle and a school of fish, lacks in mass it makes up for in whimsical charm. A drive across the Thames to Groton is necessary to see the final grouping of works on the campus of the University of Connecticut at Avery Point, where the river flows into Long Island Sound. To call it an ideal setting is an understatement. Even a trash can would look beguiling against the wide, shimmering water. But the sculptures are intrinsically much more interesting than that.</p>
        <p>Bill Barrett's welded bronze, ''Cavalier,'' is essentially an abstract composite of a horse and rider, and its subtly curved lines give it both elegance and charm.</p>
        <p>Isaac Witkin's ''Transfiguration'' is something like a drip painting given three dimensions. But the aggregate of undulating free-form shapes also recalls the Surrealists' interest in biomorphism. More exactly, the sculpture is like an animated Yves Tanguy.</p>
        <p>Two other artists take advantage of the site's relative flatness. On a large outcropping of rock sits the large round shape created out of bronze by Hemi Bawa of India. The shape has a depression on its top in which rests another small round form. Appropriately, the piece is titled ''The Girl Child,'' and the elemental shapes recall the simplicity of Hindu representations of male and female principles.</p>
        <p>A bed of densely overlapping organic shapes, rather like those in Mr. Witkin's sculpture but made of cast earth, is the basis of Charlene Teters's ''American Holocaust.'' The forms signify the bodies of massacred American Indians. Ms. Teters doesn't care that her piece looks less like a formal sculpture than an invocation of a killing field.</p>
        <p>At this point it is reasonable to predict that ''Sculpture 2000'' is the first of an ever more ambitious series of such exhibitions.</p>
        <p>''Sculpture 2000'' continues officially through Labor Day. Several of the works will remain after that.</p>
