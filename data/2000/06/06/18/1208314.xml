        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As president of the Mamaroneck Board of Education and the parent of two children who went through the Mamaroneck Avenue School, I want to express my disappointment because your report was simply wrong. First, it missed the entire context in which the ''Romeo and Juliet'' project took place, which was learning about what happens when we try to connect two ''technology-rich'' classrooms. All of the work the children did in technology education, as well as the lessons of acting and learning Shakespeare, were buried in what seemed to be a social experiment. Also, the article focused on the differences between children and their backgrounds; in our school they see the similarities.</p>
        <p>That is not a platitude, it is the words of the children, who were not asked.</p>

        <p>As president of the Mamaroneck Board of Education and the parent of two children who went through the Mamaroneck Avenue School, I want to express my disappointment because your report was simply wrong. First, it missed the entire context in which the ''Romeo and Juliet'' project took place, which was learning about what happens when we try to connect two ''technology-rich'' classrooms.

        <p>That is not a platitude, it is the words of the children, who were not asked.</p>
        <p>I have no doubt that you thought you published a nice story. However, whether we are talking about Romeo or Juliet or test scores, every time we try to categorize schools by labeling the people who go there, we miss the mark.</p>
        <p>The Mamaroneck Avenue School does have some families who come from low-income and immigrant backgrounds, but they represent only a portion of the school. Unfortunately, as our children reminded us when they read the article, the article emphasized differences when all our work has been to support what makes us all the same: love of learning, commitment to community and, in this case, a love of Shakespeare.</p>
