      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>When Newt Gingrich marries Callista Bisek in Virginia on Aug. 18 (his third marriage, her first), the ceremony will be invitation-only. But any well-wisher with a modem can visit the happy couple's gift registry, at the Web sites of Macy's and Williams-Sonoma. (Gingrich is no longer subject to Congressional ethics rules, so there's no need for restraint.) The list, excerpted below, offers certain clues about the life these two may lead. They'll do a lot of celebrating: a dozen $99 beer steins are registered, as are a dozen claret glasses, Champagne flutes, liqueur glasses, etc., etc. Their dinners will be elegant but not fussy -- the cutlery is stainless steel, and the china is all dishwasher safe -- and may well include lasagna, casseroles, spaghetti, tarts or brownies. As for the king-size Ralph Lauren bed linens? It's best not to speculate. ''Neither I nor Newt comments on his private life,'' says Mike Shields, his spokesman. ''Sorry.''</p>
