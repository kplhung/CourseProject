        <p>Morris High School student Lady E Santana letter disputes Jonathan Kozol's June 4 essay on Morris High School (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am what Mr. Kozol would call one of the children ''whom society most deeply scorns.'' I have just turned 17 and I am graduating from Morris High School with honors and a Regents diploma. If I were a despised student, I would never have been accepted to colleges nor received any scholarships. My acceptances include SUNY-Binghamton, where I will be attending in the fall, Iona College, Fairleigh Dickinson, Rutgers, SUNY-Stony Brook and the College of New Rochelle.</p>
        <p>At the age of 8, just like Pineapple, I decided that I wanted to become a doctor. When I arrived at this school at age 13, I decided that I wanted to become a heart surgeon. Morris had a lot to offer me as a talented and focused student. Now, thanks to Morris, I am fulfilling my dream of working in an operating room (as part of an after-school program) and am experiencing what my future career may be like.</p>

        <p>Morris High School does not serve as ''storage space'' but as a center of learning and opportunity.</p>
