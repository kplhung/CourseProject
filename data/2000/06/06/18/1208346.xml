        <p>Three-card monte may be illegal here, but in Brooklyn Heights a complicated game is being played out involving three restaurants, two brick ovens and one coveted name.</p>
        <p>In two windows on Montague Street, placards read: ''Lassen &amp; Hennigs and Monty Q's are not associated in any way with the business on the corner of Montague and Clinton Streets.''</p>
        <p>That business, Monty Plaza Market Cafe, which is to open in two weeks, plans to sell pizza. That intention has caused consternation a few doors down at Monty Q's pizzeria. Further down the street is Lassen &amp; Hennigs, a deli that has never been called Monty's but is owned by the family that owns Monty Q's.</p>
        <p>George Chamoun, who opened Monty Q's two years ago, says he believes that Monty Plaza wants to capitalize on his good name by confusing customers. ''A lot of people ask, 'Oh, you're opening a new restaurant?' '' Mr. Chamoun said, ''but we say, no, we're not.''</p>
        <p>''I've been over there,'' he added. ''Their brick oven is smaller than ours.''</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Mr. Chamoun filed suit in State Supreme Court accusing Monty Plaza of intent to ''deceive and mislead the public.''</p>
        <p>Harjit Dhir, the owner of Monty Plaza, said when he chose the name he was unaware of another Monty's on the block. ''My landlord, he thought of it,'' Mr. Dhir said, adding, 'My older son's name is Monty, too.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dhir's landlord, Arthur Weiner, said he based his suggestion on the street name and also on his love for the 1970's-era British comic group Monty Python's Flying Circus.</p>
        <p>''We were brainstorming, and I thought, 'Gee, wouldn't that be a funny name?' '' Mr. Weiner said. ''When I think of Monty Python's Flying Circus, it makes me happy.''</p>
        <p>Another issue was the feelings of Mr. Dhir's son, Monty. The 13-year-old is ''so excited,'' said Mr. Dhir's brother, Billy Mann. ''His father doesn't want to break his heart.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chamoun is being philosophical. ''If it worked out that they changed the name, great.'' If not, he said: ''We have our good customers.  They know we have fresh, delicious food.'' Mr. Mann, who will work briefly at Monty Plaza, is considering opening his own restaurant in the area. Will he call it Monty's? ''No! No!''</p>
