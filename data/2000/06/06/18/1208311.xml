        <p>Arthur Aitkens did not reach the second round two weeks ago in the Van Cliburn Foundation's Second International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs in Fort Worth, Tex. Still, the retired corporate lawyer said that just being there through the first round was reward enough.</p>
        <p>''Absolutely,'' Mr. Aitkens said from his Armonk home  Wednesday. ''It's an extraordinary event.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Aitkens was sidelined, three of the 18 semifinalists were New Yorkers: Christopher Basso, Carl Tait and Steven Ryan. Mr. Basso, an assistant manager at a Manhattan Starbucks coffee shop, won the $2,000 first prize and an invitation to perform at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington today. After a 40-year absence, Mr. Aitkens returned to the piano for physical therapy after a 1988 horse-riding accident. He hasn't decided yet if he will audition for the next Van Cliburn amateur competition. ''We'll see,'' he said. ''I'm practicing a few new pieces just in case.''</p>
