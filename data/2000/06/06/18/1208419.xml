      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Women like to toddle off to the powder room in twos. So why not vote in tandem?</p>
        <p>That's the idea behind a new ad campaign to persuade women to vote for president, called ''Take a Friend to Vote,'' produced by the League of Women Voters, Oldsmobile and Conde Nast.</p>
        <p>Cara Deoul Perl of Conde Nast told The Times's Allison Fass that the idea was to make voting ''very personal and fun,'' suggesting that by bringing a friend to the ballot box, women can ''go vote and then go shopping. . . . It can be boring waiting on line.''</p>
        <p>The ads, which will be inserted into some Conde Nast magazines, will feature pairs of women, including ''West Wing'' actress Allison Janney and Deborah Thalberg, a screenwriter.</p>
        <p>It's odd that women would make such condescending ads about women.</p>
        <p>Nobody talks about planting voting booths on the ninth hole to woo foursomes of male voters.</p>
        <p>We can take our politics straight up, thank you -- without the artificial sweetener of girl talk and Saks.</p>
        <p>Women, after all, were instrumental in putting Bill Clinton in the White House -- and saving his job after the Monica muddle. Women not only understand the issues; they have made the candidates come around to the issues they care about.</p>
        <p>Al Gore and George W. Bush are knocking themselves out to court women, even adopting more feminine metaphors and schmoozing on networks for women.</p>
        <p>Besides, picking a president is the ultimate shopping trip. Why splurge on brand-name shoes you don't need when you can splurge on brand-name candidates you don't love?</p>
        <p>Politics does not need to be more personal. It needs to be less personal.</p>
        <p>As we approach the conventions, I'm filled with dread. Both candidates are planning to play nice. But what if they replace slashing with sharing?</p>
        <p>I have nightmarish visions of Android Al desperately trying to show he's soulful by sniffling at the podium, dredging up more Gore tragedy.</p>
        <p>If Karenna's life is not as golden as it seems, I don't want to know.</p>
        <p>Never mind a tax pledge. How about a ''Dark Victory'' pledge? (As in the three-hanky Bette Davis weepy.) I would like both candidates to promise not to exploit any intimate moments of family despair.</p>
        <p>There's nothing wrong with trauma influencing policy. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's brush with cancer has led  him to offer a bold and compassionate proposal to insure the uninsured.</p>
        <p>But it grates when the harrowing stories are used simply to buff an image.</p>
        <p>In Philadelphia, W. has to prove he is strong enough to be president. On ''60 Minutes'' in 1987, Bush senior defended himself against the wimp label by citing the strength needed to deal with the death of his 3-year-old daughter, Robin, from leukemia. Let's hope the younger Bush doesn't revisit that awful time.</p>
        <p>I don't even want W. to recap his dark victory over Jack Daniels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is more of a threat on this score. In L.A., the man who has been satirized as having a romantic relationship with his Palm Pilot will have to prove he is human enough to be president.</p>
        <p>Whenever he wants to suggest warm blood runs through his veins, he plumbs family travails.</p>
        <p>Taking his confessional cue from Bill Clinton at the '92 convention, Mr. Gore told in gruesome detail about his 6-year-old son being struck by a car in 1989: ''When you've seen your reflection in the empty stare of a boy waiting for his second breath of life, you realize that we were not put here on earth to look out for our needs alone. . . .''</p>
        <p>At the '96 convention, the vice president, near tears, shared the story of his sister's death from lung cancer, saying it inspired his zeal in fighting the tobacco industry. He was excoriated when it was revealed that he had boasted about his experiences in the tobacco fields of Tennessee four years after Nancy's death and had taken money from tobacco interests.</p>
        <p>In his latest push to humanize himself, he accompanied Tipper onstage to talk about her problems with depression. She told an audience in Maryland that her husband understood mental illness in a concrete way: ''He has lived it.''</p>
        <p>Male politicians should quit acting like sob sisters. They must remember: Their personal isn't always our political.</p>
