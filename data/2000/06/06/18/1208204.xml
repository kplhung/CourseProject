        <p>THEY start lining up just before 4 p.m. That's admission time for a 7:30 show. Then some early arrivals head for the sign that reads ''blanket rocks'' and grab four anchors for their communal space on the grass in case the wind blows.</p>
        <p>Whatever the mode of seating, wherever the location, the picnickers open their baskets, and spread out the bread and the wine. But home-brought savories are mere whetters of the appetite for the true sustenance of the night: Shakespeare.</p>
        <p>In modest Pinkney Park in Rowayton, home of Shakespeare on the Sound, grassroots dinner-theater thrives. Boats are docked on the Five Mile River to the right. Mundane automobiles are driven on the street to the left. In between the contrasting views -- the tinkers and the tailors, the fairies and the foolish mortals: lunatics, lovers, poets -- play on the shortest night of the year, a fact intrinsic to the title, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' One thousand people can fit onto the greenery; as many as 1,300 have been accommodated, but 800 is ideal. This year, the fifth season, a two-week run has been increased to three, 16 performances in all.</p>
        <p>Last Sunday's revelry was shorter than planned. A half-hour into a two-hour performance, the rains came. At the first ominous darkening of the clouds, Ezra Barnes, who staged the production, announced that wireless microphones were hazardous during an electrical storm. ''We'll wait and see what happens, if it blows through,'' he said from the stage.</p>
        <p>The show did not go on. So much for the perils of theater under the sky, but there was also a sense of adventure, and how often is theater an adventure?</p>
        <p>From the cheery attendants in two parking lots to the high spirits of the audience (even in flight from the weather) it was clear that not only are the arts flourishing in Rowayton but also that community involvement need not be just a catch phrase.  Indeed, the Rowayton Shakespeare project -- festive in its own way without having to call itself a festival -- draws Norwalk, Darien and Stamford schools to participate in its education program.</p>
        <p>This year, David Shookhoff, program director of education at Manhattan Theater Club, has been brought in as a consultant. ''A family workshop series was piloted yesterday,'' he said. Another was scheduled for yesterday afternoon. Mr. Shookhoff was referring to ''hands-on theater activities focused on the play's dramatic issues, for kids and their parents,'' based on the Off Broadway theater's model. Not that educational outreach, as it is commonly called, is new to Shakespeare on the Sound.</p>
        <p>The actor Paul Bannerman Rudd -- a highly praised actor in the 1970's and 80's who put aside a career in ascent for the sake of fatherhood -- is now, 14 years and three children later, playing Theseus/ Oberon in Mr. Barnes's production.</p>
        <p>Since the company's beginnings, Mr. Rudd, who lives in Greenwich, has coached middle school students in class and in after-school programs. Teacher-training workshops and student internships have also been part of the company's purpose. ''Now we want to take it all to the next level,'' said Mr. Barnes, who was not just talking about the education component. He is ever renewed, he said, by how ''intuitively connected kids are to Shakespeare.'' And he was not just talking about the comedies. ''A tragedy went down very well last year,'' he said, referring to ''Romeo and Juliet.'' And, he added, ''kids open up the plays for their parents.''</p>
        <p>If anyone thinks that ''Midsummer's Night Dream'' is too much with us -- after a starry film version last year and the much publicized Royal Shakespeare Company production at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last month -- Mr. Barnes will have his say about ''multitudinous possibilities.''</p>
        <p>He talked about the importance of setting the play in a world where mythology is not unlikely, of the production's homemade musical instruments, but, most importantly, of dealing with ''the challenge of words, rather than imposing stuff on them.'' He abhors the revisionist Shakespeare thinking that implies ''if you just do the play, it won't be interesting.''</p>
        <p>Of Shakespeare, Mr. Barnes added, ''He is fun and he is contemporary and he never ages.''</p>
        <p>And in Pinkney Park, bug spray is right there, for the asking.</p>
        <p>''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' Shakespeare on the Sound, Pinkney Park, Five Mile River Road, Route 136. Rowayton. Performances at 7:30, nightly except Monday through next Sunday. Free ($10 donation welcomed however). The number to call for information and directions is (203)  299-1300.</p>
