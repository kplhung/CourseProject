        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has often identified herself with Eleanor Roosevelt, spent 20 minutes today touring the two-story stone cottage to which Mrs. Roosevelt retreated and where she lived out what she termed a ''complicated life.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton sat in Mrs. Roosevelt's chairs, stood on her famous sleeping porch and gazed at her books, her shortwave radios and her dining room table, where world leaders like Winston Churchill joined her for meals.</p>
        <p>The first lady went to the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site to officially designate the cottage, called Val-Kill, as a project of a national program raising money for homes and other landmarks in need of repair and restoration.</p>
        <p>Then she headed north to stump for her United States Senate campaign at a county fair in Altamont, west of Albany.</p>
        <p>Allida Black, a professor at George Washington University and a Roosevelt historian, introduced Mrs. Clinton to several hundred donors and others gathered under a tent outside the cottage as ''maybe the only person on the planet who understands Eleanor Roosevelt more than I do.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has often mentioned the life and work of Mrs. Roosevelt, who, at Val-Kill, was a prolific writer, churning out newspaper columns, hundreds of articles, several books and, on average, 150 personal letters a day.</p>
        <p>Today, Mrs. Clinton, who visited the cottage in 1995, noted that Mrs. Roosevelt was her age, 52, when she made Val-Kill a permanent home in 1945, after her husband, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, died.</p>
        <p>During her remarks, Mrs. Clinton drew heavily on the political symbolism of Mrs. Roosevelt's work for  human rights and other causes, and spoke of ''keeping her dream alive.''</p>
        <p>She also alluded to the ridicule that erupted after Bob Woodward, in a 1996 book, ''The Choice,'' said she carried on imaginary conversations with Mrs. Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>She said that during one of her first public appearances as first lady, she told a crowd during an event at Lincoln Center in New York City, ''You know, the White House just encourages me to have conversations with Mrs. Roosevelt.''</p>
        <p>As the crowd began laughing, she added, ''I meant it as a metaphor. But it became yet again one of those things people talked about, I guess sort of suggesting I really had gone off the deep end. But you know, it's not a bad idea, to think about what Mrs. Roosevelt would do or say.''</p>
        <p>In closing her remarks and thanking donors who had contributed $150,000 to help restore the cottage, which has sustained water damage and is missing pieces of furniture that were auctioned off after Mrs. Roosevelt died in 1962, she said, ''Next time I talk to her, I will tell her everything you have done.''</p>
        <p>The guide who led Mrs. Clinton through Val-Kill, Franceska Macsali Urbin, the same guide who did so in 1995, said that on the first tour Mrs. Clinton was full of questions.</p>
        <p>But today, she said, ''she wanted to drink in atmosphere and feel what it would be like to be here when Mrs. Roosevelt was here.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 22, 2000, Thursday  An article in some copies on Sunday about Hillary Rodham Clinton's tour of Val-Kill, Eleanor Roosevelt's home in Hyde Park, N.Y., misstated Mrs. Roosevelt's age when she made Val-Kill her permanent home after her husband, Franklin D. Roosevelt, died in 1945. She was 60, not 52.</p>
