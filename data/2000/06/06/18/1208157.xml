        <p>The Experience Music Project (E.M.P.), an interactive museum devoted to American popular music in general and rock 'n' roll in particular, is scheduled to open Friday in Seattle. The building, at the base of the Space Needle, promises to become a landmark itself. Designed by Frank O. Gehry, the $100 million, 140,000-square-foot building is a cluster of large blobs, each clad in silver, gold, purple, red or blue metallic panels.</p>
        <p>E.M.P., conceived and funded by the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, combines traditional museum displays with hands-on activities, a virtual ride using motion platform technology, about 45 videotaped oral histories and other short films, and a performance hall. Opening exhibits will examine the development of the guitar, rock milestones, the roots of rock in jazz, blues and other genres, and more recent rock spinoffs such as hip-hop and grunge.</p>

        <p>The Experience Music Project (E.M.P.), an interactive museum devoted to American popular music in general and rock 'n' roll in particular, is scheduled to open Friday in Seattle. The building, at the base of the Space Needle, promises to become a landmark itself. Designed by Frank O. Gehry, the $100 million, 140,000-square-foot building is a cluster of large blobs, each clad in silver, gold, purple, red or blue metallic panels.</p>
        <p>E.M.P., conceived and funded by the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, combines traditional museum displays with hands-on activities, a virtual ride using motion platform technology, about 45 videotaped oral histories and other short films, and a performance hall. Opening exhibits will examine the development of the guitar, rock milestones, the roots of rock in jazz, blues and other genres, and more recent rock spinoffs such as hip-hop and grunge.</p>
        <p>One exhibit will be devoted entirely to Jimi Hendrix, a Seattle native and a particular passion of Mr. Allen, who amassed one of the world's largest collections of Hendrix memorabilia before donating it to E.M.P.</p>
        <p>The museum has more than 80,000 artifacts, and roughly 1,400 of them will be exhibited at a time. Among the objects on display for the opening will be a Gibson Flying V prototype guitar from 1957 and a pink feather boa worn by Janis Joplin. A combination of headset and minicomputer, available without extra charge, will allow, for example, a visitor to hear Bo Diddley's guitar while viewing it.</p>
        <p>In one gallery, the Sound Lab, visitors can play a variety of musical instruments, and even those who are not musically inclined will be able to perform on stage before a synthesized audience. E.M.P. also has an electronic library, a 200-seat theater for concerts, lectures and films, a gift shop and a full-service restaurant, which will offer live music nightly.</p>
        <p>E.M.P. is at Fifth and Harrison Streets in Seattle Center downtown. Open daily from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., with admission on the half hour until 9:30; $19.95 for adults. Information: (206) 770-2700, or online at www .emplive.com.</p>
