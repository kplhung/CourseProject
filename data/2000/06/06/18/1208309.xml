        <p>Laytner's Linens and Homes will become a new occupant of the 40,000-square-foot space formerly occupied by Alex and Henry's in Eastchester, one of Westchester's largest restaurants and caterers, which  closed at the beginning of the year after the death of one of the owners.</p>
        <p>It will be the first suburban store -- and the largest -- for Laytner's, which has three stores in Manhattan. The new store, which will occupy 11,500 square feet, expects to open within four months. Mel Laytner, the owner, said he decided to open in Westchester at the urging of many customers who once lived in Manhattan.</p>
