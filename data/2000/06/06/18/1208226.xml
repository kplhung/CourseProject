        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As one of the organizers of the original FACT gathering in Princeton in 1974, I was delighted to read Mr. Landesman's cheerful tribute to the energy and contentiousness of that historic meeting. The entire enterprise was the invention of that cheerful rogue of the Broadway scene Alexander H. Cohen, who saw it (correctly) as a splendid means of attracting national attention to the Broadway theater.</p>
        <p>Alex organized the event and its attendant publicity with his usual showman's skill and panache, frightening some of the nonprofit participants with the lavishness of the arrangements and the catering.</p>

        <p>As one of the organizers of the original FACT gathering in Princeton in 1974, I was delighted to read Mr. Landesman's cheerful tribute to the energy and contentiousness of that historic meeting. The entire enterprise was the invention of that cheerful rogue of the Broadway scene Alexander H.

        <p>Alex organized the event and its attendant publicity with his usual showman's skill and panache, frightening some of the nonprofit participants with the lavishness of the arrangements and the catering.</p>
        <p>Reading his recent obituaries, I missed reading of his amiable skulduggery, which was so much a part of his nature as to constitute a way of life. A producer who could lease a wall near Times Square and then rent it back to one of his own productions at a handsome markup, or take a bunch of theater luminaries in a huge limo to a lunch in Boston (thus sidestepping Hurricane Donna), deserves a special niche in Broadway history for so richly contributing to our gaiety.</p>
        <p>HUGH SOUTHERN  Baltimore</p>
        <p>The writer was executive director of the Theater Development Fund from 1968 to 1982.</p>
