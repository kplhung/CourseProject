        <p>ABOUT 20 people were hunched over tables at the Museum Mile street fair on Fifth Avenue Tuesday evening, colored markers in hand, writing notations on a map, like seafarers planning a journey. But they were headed toward the past.</p>
        <p>Mary L. Ciecierski loped through the crowd, guiding a friend toward the tables, which were set up at 103rd Street.</p>
        <p>''Whose map is it?'' asked her friend.</p>
        <p>''It's not anybody's map,'' Ms. Ciecierski said. ''It's our map.'' As soon as she arrived in front of the map of Manhattan, Ms. Ciecierski, 46, recounted her arrival in New York 22 years ago and spoke of her first home in the city on Gramercy Park South.</p>
        <p>''I moved into a women's residence, the Parkside Evangeline, where I met Dora, Carla, Helene and Debbie, and they're all still my friends now,'' she said with a nostalgic hitch in her voice. ''My whole life is here, my work, my friends, my church, everything.''</p>
        <p>This public historiography is part of a program called ''Mapping Memories,'' created four years ago by Liz Sevcenko, a public historian, and sponsored, since 1998, by the Museum of the City of New York, which is situated right where the tables were placed. The idea, she said, is to record personal histories to create a ''collective history'' of New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>''Some people are tracing their love histories through the city, other people are mapping their violent histories through the city by delineating gang territories, and other people are mapping their work histories so it becomes a labor history of the city as well,'' Ms. Sevcenko said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sevcenko, who works at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, takes maps  to street fairs, community centers and museums all over the city. She has collected comments for all the boroughs in various languages besides English, including Spanish, Chinese, German and Creole French. She has videotaped some contributors to the maps, who elaborate on their memories for the camera. She is also planning to create a Web site, at which she will duplicate the maps with past contributions and on which visitors may add new observations.</p>
        <p>On the tables at 103rd Street last week, J. Svehlak had placed an ''x'' in purple marker next to 109 Washington Street, near the World Trade Center. He or she also wrote, ''1890's -- Little Syria. I remember my mother walking me by here to show me where she lived after they arrived from Moravia in 1912, just before the Titanic sank!''</p>
        <p>On a stretch of road next to the Harlem River, someone noted in turquoise marker, ''I learned to drive on these streets.'' With several strokes of red ink, someone has blocked out a section of what is now part of Chinatown, bounded by Pike and Madison Streets, as ''1950's Puerto Rican neighborhood.'' Someone else has used orange marker to color in a block of Fletcher Street between Water and Front Streets, and has drawn tiny lines out from it like sun rays. Next to it, he or she wrote, ''Found My Soul! Happy Happy Happy!''</p>
        <p>Jose Luis Mejia leaned over the map with his son, Emanuel, 5, looking for the boy's favorite spot in Manhattan, East Side Pond,  near his home on East 60th Street. ''I'm from another country, Colombia, so this is part of his learning about the city where he was born,'' Mr. Mejia said. He added that he was thinking of writing simply ''I was here today,'' on the map.</p>
        <p>History, Ms. Sevcenko said, is a process of interpretation.</p>
        <p>''Some people have very conflicting claims over history, so the map was a way for people to mark out their versions,'' she said. ''With all these people leaning into the table, bumping into each other as they mark the map, people also learn there's a lot of different meanings, and no one person has universal claim to it.''</p>
        <p>The map is a bit antiquated, and some  names are inaccurate. Someone has crossed out the words Welfare Island, for example, and written in the new name, Roosevelt Island. And they've added their two cents: ''Leased by city to New York State and run by political appointees of the governor without regard for residents' views. A political nightmare for democracy.''</p>
        <p>Many of the scribbles on the map are just names, or tidbits like, ''I lived here, 1989,'' more like graffiti tags than pieces of historical information. Although Ms. Sevcenko confides that she prefers memories that have a ''qualitative and quantitative quality,'' the map itself is less important to her than getting people involved in ''literally putting themselves on the map.''</p>
        <p>As Shirley Whitney, another scribbler, said: ''People always like to find themselves, to be able to point to home. It's like when you're in a plane and you look down and you say, 'That's my house. That's me down there.' ''</p>
