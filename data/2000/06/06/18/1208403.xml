      <abstract>
        <p>Verlyn Klinkenborg The City Life column observes that the game of golf is the same whether played at Mosholu Golf Course in the Bronx or Pebble Beach Golf Links in Monterey, Calif</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>If you stood on the first fairway at the Mosholu Golf Course in the Bronx and had a full measure of the Walter Mitty that seems part of every golfer, you could almost pretend that the sound of the No. 4 train pulling into Woodlawn Station was the sound of surf on the rocks below Pebble Beach Golf Links in Monterey, Calif., where the 100th United States Open is being played this weekend. With that much Walter Mitty in you, you might as well pretend that the green-vested M.T.A. service crews at Woodlawn, where the 4 train terminates, are a legion of caddies and that the shot you just drove into the rough flew as far and as true as Tiger Woods can drive a golf ball.</p>
        <p>For most of us, golf is the sport of self-delusion, whether you play at Mosholu or in Monterey. There are differences, of course. Mosholu, founded in 1904, is 15 years older than Pebble Beach, and it has vastly better access by public transportation. The walk to a good pizza, or the ride to a Yankees game, is much shorter at Mosholu, and the souvenirs -- a Mosholu golf towel with crossed tomahawks, for instance -- are cheaper by far. It costs about $300 less to play a round of golf in the Bronx than at Pebble Beach, and the wait for a tee time is about a year less. There is none of that distracting ocean fog. The difference between a taxi honking and a seal barking is really just one of taste.</p>

        <p>If you stood on the first fairway at the Mosholu Golf Course in the Bronx and had a full measure of the Walter Mitty that seems part of every golfer, you could almost pretend that the sound of the No. 4 train pulling into Woodlawn Station was the sound of surf on the rocks below Pebble Beach Golf Links in Monterey, Calif., where the 100th United States Open is being played this weekend.

        <p>For most of us, golf is the sport of self-delusion, whether you play at Mosholu or in Monterey. There are differences, of course. Mosholu, founded in 1904, is 15 years older than Pebble Beach, and it has vastly better access by public transportation. The walk to a good pizza, or the ride to a Yankees game, is much shorter at Mosholu, and the souvenirs -- a Mosholu golf towel with crossed tomahawks, for instance -- are cheaper by far. It costs about $300 less to play a round of golf in the Bronx than at Pebble Beach, and the wait for a tee time is about a year less. There is none of that distracting ocean fog. The difference between a taxi honking and a seal barking is really just one of taste.</p>
        <p>The general public believes that it will never be able to play a round at Pebble Beach, and that belief is pretty accurate, unless money and time are no objects. The general public also believes that Mosholu Golf Course is already closed, when in fact it is open now and will be until September 2001. Business dropped off sharply last summer after the golf course was selected as the site of a planned filtration plant for New York City water, which will require five years for construction and at least two years to rebuild the course.</p>
        <p>But you do not have to be Mittyish at all to see that the same golf is played at Mosholu as at Monterey -- if not perhaps at the level being played by the pros this weekend. On the first hole at Mosholu Thursday afternoon, two fathers and three sons were chipping onto the green. The dogwoods were blooming. The fairway grass had just been mowed. On the ninth tee, a golfer drove his ball sharply into the trunk of an oak and made a fine recovery. At the driving range, golfers flapped their arms like pigeons to warm up and then made pigeon-like faces as they watched their shots recede into the distance.</p>
