      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The office of California's insurance commissioner has been hit by a scandal that threatens to cost him his job and the tottering California Republican Party some of its hopes for rejuvenation in the 2000 election.</p>
        <p>The commissioner, Charles Quackenbush, one of only two Republicans who hold statewide office, is fighting accusations that he allowed half a dozen insurance companies to shortchange earthquake victims, and that in return the companies financed nonprofit foundations that he set up to funnel political slush money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quackenbush, who has talked of running for governor or the United States Senate, denies the accusations, saying that, at worst, he is guilty of only careless administrative oversight.</p>
        <p>''It's a witch hunt,'' he said the other day.</p>
        <p>The insurance companies also deny any wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>But committees of both houses of the California Legislature are investigating, as is the California attorney general, Bill Lockyer. With each new revelation, and each new demand for Mr. Quackenbush's resignation or impeachment or trial on criminal charges, Republican officials wonder whether the 2000 election could turn out to be a worse disaster than the 1998 election.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Democrats took back the governor's office, gained control of both houses of the State Legislature and left Republicans holding only a pair of cabinet-level offices, insurance commissioner and secretary of state.</p>
        <p>''We surely don't need a scandal at this point,'' said Senator James L. Brulte, the leader of the Senate Republican caucus and perhaps the most powerful Republican in the state.</p>
        <p>Specifically, Mr. Quackenbush is accused of striking a sweetheart deal with insurance companies in which he agreed not to fine them $3 billion for shortchanging claimants after the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake and they agreed, in turn, to make $12.8 million in tax-deductible contributions to foundations that he set up to help quake victims -- foundations, it is said, that he then used to funnel money to friends and into schemes to advance his political career.</p>
        <p>In one instance, the legislative committees have been told, $263,000 in foundation money was given to a football camp attended by the Quackenbush children and $500,000 was given to the Greater Sacramento Urban League, whose board includes Mr. Quackenbush.</p>
        <p>In another instance, according to other testimony, $400,000 in foundation money was used to pay Mr. Quackenbush's longtime political advisory team for help in establishing the foundations, and then, at the team's recommendation, $100,000 in foundation money was used to pay for a poll regarding Mr. Quackenbush's political popularity, followed by a $3 million payment for a television campaign on earthquake preparedness that prominently featured Mr. Quackenbush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quackenbush told one investigative committee that he was ''mortified'' by the ''perception'' of any wrongdoing by the foundations. He faulted the officials to whom he said he had delegated responsibility to run the foundations.</p>
        <p>''We're obviously going to have to try a different way,'' he conceded.</p>
        <p>The committee chairman, Assemblyman Jack Scott, said, ''They seem clearly out of control.''</p>
        <p>Officials for the insurance companies, among them Allstate, Farmers, State Farm and 20th Century, insist they never underpaid any of the 600,000 victims of the 1994 quake, one of the costliest disasters to strike this country and one that has cost the companies $16 billion so far. Still, the companies say it was far less painful to finance the Quackenbush foundations than to fight off the commissioner's threat to take $3 billion more in fines.</p>
        <p>To make sure the companies did not balk at his offer, some officials say, Mr. Quackenbush put up a display of the kinds of adverse news articles they might face should they be fined.</p>
        <p>As for how foundation money was spent, the companies insist they were as shocked as anyone to find out.</p>
        <p>''Tackling drills were not the kind of shaking we expected the money to be spent on,'' Steve Patterson, a State Farm lawyer, told one legislative committee.</p>
        <p>One of the most powerful and outspoken Democrats in the Legislature, John Burton, the president pro tem of the Senate, said: ''Don't be fooled. They were all in it together.''</p>
        <p>When the scandal broke several months ago, Republican leaders kept quiet in hopes of keeping the party from being tied to it. But over the last 10 days, as more and more details and accusations have emerged, especially charges that Mr. Quackenbush was closely involved in running the foundations day to day, not just in overseeing them generally, party leaders have begun to speak out.</p>
        <p>A number have joined the rising chorus of Democrats demanding that Mr. Quackenbush resign and a few have even sided with the smaller chorus of Democrats who are talking of an impeachment inquiry if Mr. Quackenbush does not resign.</p>
        <p>Last week, after hearing testimony that forged checks passed through one foundation and that officials of another created minutes for meetings that never took place, Assemblyman Tom McClintock, a Republican from the area hit by the 1994 quake, said, ''The committee is now in receipt of sufficient evidence to warrant a formal impeachment inquiry.''</p>
        <p>A poll released on Thursday by the Field Institute, one of the state's leading polling organizations, found Californians favoring Mr. Quackenbush's resignation or impeachment by roughly two to one.</p>
        <p>The legislative hearings resume on June 26, with Mr. Quackenbush scheduled to testify.</p>
