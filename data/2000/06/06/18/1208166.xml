        <p>R T Davies letter on Marilyn Stasio's May 28 travel essay on Moscow questions whether Polish soldiers are being sent from Gdasnk on leave to Moscow; Stasio responds (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor: In her essay about Moscow and its lost great spies, ''Lament for Karla'' (May 28), Marilyn Stasio writes about the ''little army of fuzz-faced soldiers who marched up to me'' and ''only wanted to have their pictures taken to send home to their mothers in Gdansk.''</p>
        <p>As one who spent many years in both the Soviet Union and Poland,  I was surprised to read this. Are  the Poles, now that they belong to NATO, sending their conscripts from Gdansk on leave to Moscow? Or were some Russian recruits playing a strange sort of game, claiming their mothers were in that faraway city on the Baltic coast?</p>

        <p>It was nice to read that Ms. Stasio had tea in the good old Metropol, where my wife and I lived for many months in 1952. We had a board we put across the bathtub, on top of which we placed our two-burner electric stove, which worked fine most of the time and blew the fuses the rest of it.</p>
        <p>R.T. DAVIES  Silver Spring, Md.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stasio responds: Like all my impromptu conversations in Moscow, this effort to communicate with young soldiers was a source of some hilarity to the group -- no doubt because of my total ignorance of their language. But one linguist among them had enough English to determine that I was from New York, and when he pointed to his friends and began reeling off place names, I assumed I was being given their hometowns. It's possible, though, that I was mishearing their given names. Or perhaps getting the latest soccer scores.</p>
