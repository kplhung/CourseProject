        <p>It's not just art for art's sake. It's art for the sake of college credit.</p>
        <p>That's why thousands of art students, and their teachers, spent long hours pondering what to submit for the national Advanced Placement exam administered by the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J.</p>
        <p>This year at least part of the answer was provided by a 1999 graduate of Lakeland High School, Kristopher Thornton. After 16 slides of his ceramics were rated excellent, they were reproduced and shared with teachers nationwide. The testing service said the work ''demonstrates a clear progression from traditional forms to pieces that are much more sculpturally adventurous.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, slides from some upstart from the class of 2000 will replace Mr. Thornton's work on the testing service circuit. He has moved on himself, recently completing his freshman year at SUNY-New Paltz. And he's working two jobs this summer, not exactly taking it easy. But he is more relaxed than the 13,000-plus students who took the A.P. art exam this year.  They're still waiting to learn how their work stacks up to his.</p>
