        <p>With the number of homicides in some of the nation's big cities rising in 1999 and the first five months of 2000, after eight years of sharp drops, concern is rising among law enforcement officials and criminologists about whether the decline in violent crime has finally come to an end.</p>
        <p>The evidence is too fragmentary, and contradictory, the experts caution, to draw a firm conclusion. Virtually all of the forces that contributed to the drop in homicide since 1991 are still in place: more criminals in prisons, innovative police strategies, intense community efforts to work with troubled youths, a waning of the crack cocaine epidemic and a strong economy providing more jobs in impoverished neighborhoods. But the available data do not include demographic information.</p>
        <p>But in 1999, 5 of the 17 cities that have more than 100 homicides a year had an increase in killings, the first time since the early 1990's that slayings have increased in so many cities. Through the end of May this year, seven of these cities showed an increase from the same period last year. Together, these 17 cities accounted for more than a quarter of the nation's 15,600 homicides in 1999.</p>
        <p>New York was the only city in the group to experience a rise in homicides in 1999 and the first five months of this year.</p>
        <p>Concerns about crime have been heightened recently by shocking attacks in several cities. New York, for instance, has seen the killing of 10 cabdrivers, the fatal shooting of five employees in a Wendy's restaurant in Queens in May and a rampage in Central Park last weekend in which  50 women reported being groped or assaulted by young men.</p>
        <p>But most police officials say that the upturns in homicide in 1999 and 2000 are simply a normal statistical variation after so many good years, which had brought homicide rates to their lowest point nationally since 1967. And some criminal justice experts agree with them, to an extent.</p>
        <p>''Part of the increase in murder rates is simply that, at a certain point, you can't go any lower,'' said James Alan Fox, the Lipman professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University. ''The rates have come down so far, they simply can't be maintained at such a low level.''</p>
        <p>To underscore this, Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, said he had calculated that if the decline in homicide in the 1990's continued at the same rapid rate, the United States would have no killings in 2007, an obvious impossibility.</p>
        <p>In New York City, Police Commissioner Howard Safir contends the police may be victims of their own success in reducing the number of killings to 671 in 1999 from 2,245 in 1990. ''I think the goal should be zero, but in a city of 8 million, the reality is you can only go so low,'' Mr. Safir  said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>He noted that the other categories of serious crimes, including robbery, assault, rape, burglary, theft and automobile theft, are down by 8 percent this year in New York. ''So I don't think we've bottomed out on crime, but we may have bottomed out on murder.''</p>
        <p>In fact, after years in which New York officials have used the homicide rate as a measure of their success in making the city safer, Mr. Safir suggested it might be more accurate to look at the broader range of all serious crimes.</p>
        <p>In 1999, New York had a 6 percent increase in homicides, and through the end of May this year there have been 269 homicides, compared with 248 in the same period in 1999, an increase of 8.5 percent. But Mr. Safir said that with the recent adoption of Operation Condor, which lets police officers in high crime areas work more overtime, there had been a small drop in homicides in May and so far in June, and he predicted that the total for 2000 would be about where it was in 1999.</p>
        <p>Another difficulty in drawing conclusions from the national homicide figures for 1999 and so far this year is that there are no obvious patterns to account for the increases in homicide in the cities that have had them.</p>
        <p>In Phoenix, which had a 15 percent increase in killings in 1999, Sgt. Jeff Halstead, a spokesman for the city's police department, said the rise could be largely attributed to the city's rapid population growth and its position near the Mexican border, with a large influx of drugs and illegal immigrants. ''What we have seen is an increase in homicides related to narcotics and undocumented Mexican nationals making their way into the metro Phoenix area,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In response, the Phoenix police put together a special homicide task force this year, with many of its members Spanish speakers, and the city has had a drop in homicides through the end of May, down to 63 this year from 91 in the corresponding period last year.</p>
        <p>But in Los Angeles, which has had 181 homicides in the first five months of this year, compared with 159 in the same months in 1999, Jason Lee, a spokesman for the police department, said he has no explanation.</p>
        <p>One theory advanced by some criminologists to explain the upsurge is that a new generation of teenagers, too young to have experienced the terrifying consequences of the crack epidemic of the late 1980's -- the shootings, gang fights and waves of imprisonment -- may now be looking for a new form of excitement. That might explain, Professor Blumstein said, an incident in Providence, R.I., on June 8 in which five young men forced two college students at gunpoint to get into their car outside a nightclub, then drove them to a golf course, tortured them and shot them in the head.</p>
        <p>But Geoffrey Canada, president of the Rheedlen Center for Children and Families in Harlem who works with troubled juveniles, said he had not observed any trend of a return to  the gun, drug and gang culture among teenagers in New York. ''I've seen an increase in kids who are cut, with box cutters and razors, but not the return of lethality and guns,'' Mr. Canada said. ''We haven't lost a kid in several years.''</p>
