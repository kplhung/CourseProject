        <p>Tall Ships Aweigh</p>
        <p>The public will have an opportunity to go down to the sea in one of six tall ships during the Sail for the Sound event on Saturday and next Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
        <p>Traditional sailing vessels will leave Brewer Yacht Haven Marina in Stamford every hour. Passengers will be put to work raising sails and then will be given a short course on the ecology of Long Island Sound and its maritime history.</p>
        <p>Educators from the Greenwich Audubon Society, the Bruce Museum of Arts and Sciences, the Byram River Watershed Alliance, Stamford Museum and Nature Center, and Save The Sound will conduct the talks and other shipboard activities.</p>
        <p>At dockside, a day of music, environmental and ecological displays, and performances by Neighborhood Watch Stilts International from Britain will keep visitors entertained.</p>
        <p>The marina is at the foot of Washington Boulevard, reached from Exit 7 of Interstate 95. Sailing tickets are $25, $15 for children under 13. The number to call for reservations or more information is (203) 323-2978.</p>
        <p>Antiques Market</p>
        <p>The spacious meadows on Route 7, just north of Wilton High School's Field House, will be the setting for the Wilton Outdoor Antiques Marketplace on Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., rain or shine.</p>
        <p>More than 200 dealers will exhibit in room settings under tents; English, European and American furniture, ceramics, decorative arts, garden furnishings, architectural fragments, folk art and fine art are among their offerings. The American Arts and Crafts Movement and 20th-century design will also be represented.</p>
        <p>Admission will be $7; admission on Saturday from 8 to 10 a.m. will be $20.</p>
        <p>The First Novel</p>
        <p>Lady Murasaki Shikibu, the 11th-century Japanese noblewoman who is said to have written the world's first novel, ''The Tale of Genji,'' will be the subject of a talk on Wednesday at 7:30 in the Perrot Memorial Library, Old Greenwich.</p>
        <p>The speaker, Liza Dalby, is an anthropologist specializing in Japanese culture who says she is the only Westerner ever to become a geisha. She has spent 10 years researching and writing ''The Tale of Murasaki,'' a fictional autobiography published this year by Doubleday.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dalby's earlier book (''Geisha,'' published in 1983 by Berkeley: University of California Press) was based on research for her doctorate and became a source for Arthur Golden in the writing of his novel, ''Memoirs of a Geisha.''</p>
        <p>The library is at 90 Sound Beach Avenue and admission is free; reservations should be made by calling (203) 637-3870.</p>
        <p>Commercials, Commercials</p>
        <p>Death, taxes, the weather and commercials are some of the inevitable things you can do little or nothing about. But commercials as historical pastiche can be entertaining.</p>
        <p>Thus the Director's View Film Festival in conjunction with the International Festival of Arts and Ideas now taking place in Fairfield and New Haven counties, will present three showings of ''The Night of the AdEaters,'' a collection of the best, worst, funniest, corniest, sharpest and dullest commercials filmed from 1892 to the present.</p>
        <p>The first screening will be held on Friday at 11 p.m. in the Ferguson Library, Broad and Bedford Streets in Stamford. The next venue, on Saturday at midnight, will be the Little Theater, 1 Lincoln Street in New Haven, and the third, on June 29 at 11 p.m., will be the Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street between Park and Madison Avenues in Manhattan. Admission will be $5 a night. The number to call for more information is (914) 533-0270.</p>
        <p>Soviet Art</p>
        <p>''Realism: The Spirit of Soviet Art, 1932-1980,'' an exhibition on view at at the Thomas J. Walsh Gallery, Fairfield University, through July 17, is meant to challenge a longstanding belief that art in the Soviet era was politically motivated propaganda.</p>
        <p>More than 35 works of official Soviet art are in the show, portraying the daily lives of ordinary people and often imbuing them with heroic qualities as workers toiling for the common good and the success of communism.</p>
        <p>While artists in the West during the same period were experimenting with abstraction, surrealism, minimalism, graphics, non-representational forms and other isms aplenty, Soviet artists, some art historians say, were perfecting realism within a socialist society that gave them the freedom to focus on a working-class genre.</p>
        <p>The gallery is open Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from noon to 4.</p>
        <p>Admission is free. The number to call for more information is (203) 254-4000, extension 2969.</p>
        <p>Nature Hike</p>
        <p>Fathers and their families are welcome to enjoy a day communing with nature -- particularly with Connecticut's state flower, the mountain laurel, during a three- to four-mile hike today from 1 to 3 p.m. at the Devil's Den Preserve in Weston.</p>
        <p>Natural history guides, will lead the group through the forest, where mountain laurel forms a blossoming understory. The terrain is moderately strenuous, including a climb to Deer Knoll to view an expanse of ridgetops. Hikers should wear appropriate clothing and shoes, and bring water.</p>
        <p>The Den is at 33 Pent Road. The number to call for free registration is (203) 226-4991.</p>
        <p>Colorful Landscapes</p>
        <p>Bobbi Eike Mullen's colorful, semi-pointillist landscapes may be seen through June at the Wilton Library, 137 Old Ridgefield Road. Ms. Mullen, a teacher of painting at the Wooster Community Art Center in Danbury, has won many awards for her paintings, and her work has been acquired by several private collections in the United States and abroad.</p>
        <p>Library hours are Monday and Friday from 10 a.m.to 6 p.m.; Tuesday through Thursday from 10 to 7, and Saturday from 10 to 5.</p>
        <p>The number for more information is (203) 762-3950.</p>
