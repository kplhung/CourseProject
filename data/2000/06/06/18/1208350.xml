        <p>Meredith Lynne Faltin and Duncan Wayne Lamont were married yesterday at Eilean Donan Castle in Dornie, Scotland. The Rev. John Clark, a Presbyterian minister, performed the ceremony.</p>
        <p>Ms. Faltin, 25, will keep her name. She is an actress who appears in regional theater productions and is also a waitress at the Barking Dog Luncheonette, in New York. She graduated from Marymount Manhattan College and is a daughter of Linda Righi Faltin and Joseph E. Faltin of Millwood, N.Y. Her father is a mathematics teacher and the senior-class dean at the Hackley School, a private school in Tarrytown, N.Y. Her mother is the supervisor of reading and language arts for the Copiague (N.Y.) School District.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamont, 33, is a songwriter and a guitarist for Fletcher McTaggart, a New York rock band. He is also the office operations assistant in the New York branch of Svenska Handelsbanken, a Swedish investment bank. He graduated from Edinburgh University, and is a son of Alice Yeater Lamont of Aberdeen, Scotland, and the late Rev. Alastair F. Lamont. His father was a minister of the Church of Scotland and the leader of the Denburn Parish Church in Aberdeen.</p>
        <p>The bride and bridegroom met in April 1998, when she tried out as a backup singer for Mr. Lamont's band in New York. She was hired, but after several months, the members of the band said that her voice was not meshing with their sound. It was Mr. Lamont's chore to get rid of her. By then, however, they had been living together for weeks. ''She was extremely cool about it,'' Mr. Lamont said. ''She understood and accepted it, and I guess you could say that that's when I knew.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Faltin said: ''I kind of saw it coming, so I wasn't too surprised. I was a little surprised that they made him do it, but I found out later he was the official firer of the band.''</p>
        <p>What might have created a permanent rift in other relationships became something they recount with laughter. A few months later, they began to talk of marriage.</p>
        <p>''She proposed to me, actually, on the subway train on the way to a gig,'' Mr. Lamont said. ''We fashioned a ring out of a gum wrapper.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''I really love his music, and I was in a good mood, and it was really more like, 'I think I want to set a date.' It wasn't like something I planned.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Faltin's mother said she does not worry about how her actress-slash-waitress daughter and her musician-slash-office assistant son-in-law will fare.</p>
        <p>''I think that the two of them, they won't starve,'' she said. ''Behind all the artistic personality that they have, they both have a streak of common sense. They will be fine.''</p>
