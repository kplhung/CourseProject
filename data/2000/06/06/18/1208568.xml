        <p>SPRING is a good time to inspect the roof, chimney and gutters. Naturally, this entails climbing a ladder to get up to the roof. Unfortunately, many do-it-yourselfers (and a lot professionals) take ladder safety for granted; as a result, more than 90,000 ladder-related accidents are reported each year.</p>
        <p>While most of these accidents happened because the users failed to observe basic safety precautions, a few accidents occurred because of equipment failure. Therefore it's a good idea to inspect your ladder every time you use it.</p>
        <p>Make sure that all the rungs are clean, secure and undamaged, and that the side rails are sound. Inspect all the bolts, nuts and rivets to make sure they are tight. Never paint a ladder; the paint will hide any defects, cracks or splits that could comprise the ladder's structural integrity.</p>
        <p>All ladders sold in the United States are rated and labeled according to their weight capacity.</p>
        <p>Type 1A ladders are designed for heavy-duty industrial use and are rated up to 300 pounds</p>
        <p>Type II ladders are for medium-duty commercial chores and are rated for maximum of 225 pounds.</p>
        <p>Type III ladders are for general house-hold work and have a maximum capacity of 200 pounds.</p>
        <p>Make sure you know your ladder's weight rating and do not exceed it. Remember to take into account not only your body weight but also the weight of the tools, equipment and supplies you may have to carry with you.</p>
        <p>Before setting up a ladder, evaluate the outside weather conditions. Never set up a ladder on wet, rainy days or on windy days. Most people are not aware that a strong wind can easily blow over an aluminum or fiberglass extension ladder, even with a person standing on it. Look carefully for the location of all electrical wires and avoid positioning the ladder near them.</p>
        <p>Erecting an extension ladder is relatively easy if you place the feet of the ladder against a solid surface, like the housse foundation, then raise the ladder up by walking from the far end toward the feet with a hand-over-hand motion. When the ladder is upright leaning against the side of the house, pull out the feet so the ladder is angled against the house.</p>
        <p>The correct angle for the ladder should be one foot away from the wall for every four feet the ladder rises; or to express it another way, the base should be extended away from the house about one-quarter of the ladder's length.</p>
        <p>There is any easy way to check this critical angle without having to measure distance or lengths. Once the ladder is in position, stand with your toes against the feet of the ladder. Extend your arms straight out and grab the nearest ladder rung. If the ladder is positioned correctly, your arms should be parallel to the ground and you should be able to hold the run without bending or stretching.</p>
        <p>Before climbing on the ladder, make sure the feet are firmly based on the ground. Some extension ladders have spikes attached to the side rails. These can be pushed into the ground to keep the feet from slipping. If your ladder doesn't have these, drive wooden stakes into the ground on either side of the ladder and tie the rails to them. If you are setting the ladder on uneven ground, place a wide flat board under the feet of the ladder and level it by inserting shims underneath.</p>
        <p>Use the flat pads attached to the bottom of the ladder rails when working o flat, hard surfaces. On a wooden surface, like a deck, nail or screw a wooden cleat to the boards to keep the ladder from slipping. On damp or slippery surfaces have a helper stand in front of the ladder and brace it while you are working above.</p>
        <p>If possible, secure the top of the ladder as well. If you are working in a stationary position, you can drive a long constructin staple into a surface like the fascia board and thread a wire through the staple then wrap the wire around a rung.</p>
        <p>Another way to stabilize the ladder is by attaching a ladder stay (also called a stabilizer, or stand off) to the top of the ladder. The stay is a light frame that projects on either side of the rails to give the ladder wider support. Adjustable stays allow you to position the ladder away from the house when working on gutters or projections. To keep the ladder on gutters or projections. To keep the ladder from tipping, remember to keep you hips between the ladder rails and avoid overreaching.</p>
        <p>Using a stepladder requires the same precautions as with an extension ladder, with just a few modifications.</p>
        <p>Stepladders are designed to be used fully opened with the side locks engaged. They are self-supporting ad should not be propped against a wall for reaching heights. Do not overextend yourself by standing on either of the top two steps.</p>
