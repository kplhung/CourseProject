        <p>New York City health officials called off plans yesterday to spray insecticide in Queens after two laboratories concluded that a chicken thought to have contracted the West Nile virus was not infected.</p>
        <p>''At this time, we do not have evidence of the West Nile virus in New York City,'' said Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city's health commissioner, who said Thursday that preliminary laboratory results showed that the chicken did have the virus, which causes encephalitis.</p>
        <p>The disease, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, killed 7 people and sickened 62 others in the metropolitan region last fall. Chickens are used as an early-warning system to determine if infected mosquitoes are spreading the disease.</p>
        <p>If the diagnosis of West Nile in the chicken had been confirmed, the city was prepared to spray a broad swath of northern Queens, including Flushing Meadows-Corona Park and surrounding residential neighborhoods, near the focal point of last summer's outbreak, as early as tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Cohen said yesterday that the initial laboratory results, obtained from the Cornell Veterinary Diagnostic Lab in Ithaca, had been contradicted by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and by the National Veterinary Laboratory of the United States Department of Agriculture in Ames, Iowa.</p>
        <p>''Today's encouraging news means that the city will not be conducting targeted ground application of pesticides in Queens,'' Dr. Cohen said. ''Any pesticide application would be guided by our surveillance efforts and would only take place when viral activity is confirmed.''</p>
        <p>The Health Department's preparations for spraying resulted from a blood test of its chicken, which had been confined to a coop in Corona as a form of mosquito bait. The city has placed 14 small flocks of chickens in similar coops across the city.</p>
        <p>No cases of West Nile virus have been confirmed in the city this year. Medical experts said the city's quick response after an initially worrisome laboratory finding was prudent, since the virus was found early this month in three dead crows not far from the city's border, in Rockland County and in Bergen County, N.J.</p>
        <p>The exercise of gearing up to spray in Queens provided a model of how the city would respond if an infection was confirmed. Dr. Cohen, joined by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani at a City Hall news conference on Thursday, said the Health Department would use trucks and spray insecticide only at night, avoiding the use of aerial spraying from helicopters and the controversial insecticide malathion, which provoked angry protests last year.</p>
        <p>The plan was praised by some medical experts. They said the insecticide the city selected this year, resmethrin, which is marketed under the brand name Scourge, poses fewer health risks to people than malathion does.</p>
        <p>Sandra Mullin, a Health Department spokeswoman, said yesterday that other insecticides might be used, but the city has no plan to resume the use of malathion.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cohen said yesterday that the laboratory tests on the chicken by federal scientists had been more thorough than those at Cornell, which he described as ''rapid screening.''</p>
        <p>He said the city's mobilization since Thursday could provide a valuable dress rehearsal for a real infection, since the risk of West Nile infections remains high in northern Queens and other parts of the city.  ''We know the virus could reappear,'' he said. ''We are not putting down our guard.''</p>
