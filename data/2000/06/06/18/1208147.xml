        <p>WHY do movie audiences fidget and critics pay scant attention when a gloves-off satire of our tabloid television culture is brought to the screen? Is it that we're simply inured to satire by living in a society where grotesque reality (Monicagate, the Anita Hill hearings) seems to trump fiction at every turn? Can savage mockery of our bottom-feeding popular culture shame us enough to arouse discomfort, or have we become so arrogant and thick-skinned in our prosperity that needling humor is incapable anymore of penetrating our gold-plated hides?</p>
        <p>The latest movie satire to vanish in a blink, ''Live Virgin,'' is a rough-hewn, often hilarious spoof of sex, television and virtual reality in which a pornography mogul goes ballistic when his virginal daughter accepts a $200,000 offer to be deflowered on pay-per-view television on her 18th birthday. The host of the event (played by Sally Kellerman) is a haughty, ratings-obsessed Diane Sawyer-like talk-show personality. Subscribers are supplied with special kits that enable them to plug into their phone lines to experience the sex as though it were real. In other words, the Kevin Spacey character's fantasies in ''American Beauty'' can now be realized by millions of dirty old men wired up at home in ludicrous pleasure-stimulating body suits that make them look like space-invading frogs (And Mena Suvari, who played Mr. Spacey's dream girl, is ''Live Virgin's'' self-sacrificing princess).</p>

        <p>The latest movie satire to vanish in a blink, ''Live Virgin,'' is a rough-hewn, often hilarious spoof of sex, television and virtual reality in which a pornography mogul goes ballistic when his virginal daughter accepts a $200,000 offer to be deflowered on pay-per-view television on her 18th birthday. The host of the event (played by Sally Kellerman) is a haughty, ratings-obsessed Diane Sawyer-like talk-show personality. Subscribers are supplied with special kits that enable them to plug into their phone lines to experience the sex as though it were real. In other words, the Kevin Spacey character's fantasies in ''American Beauty'' can now be realized by millions of dirty old men wired up at home in ludicrous pleasure-stimulating body suits that make them look like space-invading frogs (And Mena Suvari, who played Mr. Spacey's dream girl, is ''Live Virgin's'' self-sacrificing princess).</p>
        <p>Directed by Jean-Pierre Marois, ''Live Virgin'' may not be a great comedy, but it is skillfully plotted and outrageous enough to keep the laughs coming right up until a sappy ending that is the only cop-out in an otherwise nervy movie. Its skewering of a hypocritical sexual climate in which rampant prurience and moralistic finger-pointing coexist is right on the money.</p>
        <p>The film is only the latest in a list of acidly witty satires that have received cool receptions from the public. Earlier this year, ''American Psycho,'' Mary Harron's clever translation of Bret Easton Ellis's gory novel about a yuppie serial killer into a sleek horror-comedy lampooning greed and status-seeking, disappeared quickly. Its tepid box office performance suggests that most people don't want to be reminded that there might be something pathological in the single-minded pursuit of designer labels, gym bodies and reservations at the hottest restaurants.</p>
        <p>Last year, we had ''Election,'' a film about high school society that was critically acclaimed but died at the box office, partly because of a marketing campaign that offered only the vaguest notion of what it was really about. As the movie followed the ups and downs of a hotly contested class election, in which a ruthless high-school girl used sex with a married teacher to secure her victory, the contest became a mirror of American politics, skulduggery and competition run amok.</p>
        <p>And 1998 brought us ''Very Bad Things,'' a dark comedy (also a box office bomb) about a chain of murders and coverups that begins with the accidental killing of a prostitute at a Las Vegas bachelor party. Chief among its satirical targets was a Tony Robbins-like philosophy of self-empowerment that the group's leader used to justify the heinous murders. Though monstrously selfish, he and his friends were disturbingly recognizable caricatures of morally stunted yuppie climbers.</p>
        <p>Today's climate for satire is a far cry from the 1960's, when American movie audiences could recognize and savor a dark social comedy that stirred discomfort. The genre reached a peak of popularity with ''Dr. Strangelove'' (1963), Stanley Kubrick's spoof of war-mongering Pentagon yahoos itching to play nuclear chicken, and ''The Manchurian Candidate'' (1962), the cold war satire of brainwashing, paranoia and political assassination that eerily presaged the death of John F. Kennedy. Several years ago, the comedy ''Canadian Bacon'' (about a trumped-up war with Canada) took roughly the same tack as ''Dr. Strangelove'' and flopped. The only satire to buck this negative box office trend has been ''Wag the Dog'' (1997), about an imaginary, politically distracting war promoted and waged on television.</p>
        <p>Satire came easier in the 1960's when the ''hip'' and the ''square'' were definable blocs in American society, and most people knew on which side they belonged. Subsequently several social ground swells converged to blur the distinctions. The triumph of popular culture made it no longer possible to distinguish between high and low art. And the doctrine of political correctness along with the rise of multiculturalism prevented aspiring satirists from heaping scorn on once easy targets.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the human potential and recovery movements ushered in a mass therapeutic culture, institutionalizing a nonjudgmental ''I'm O. K., you're O. K.'' social doctrine. This touchy-feely ethos has helped pathologize the misanthropy that has traditionally been the wellspring of satire; it has also tainted the venting of contempt, snobbery and critical scorn with an aura of psychic ill health, not to mention ''elitism.'' That may explain why bathroom humor has become the dominant strain in movie comedy. Since we're all one in our bodily functions, no single group need worry about being offended more than any other.</p>
        <p>What is increasingly getting lost in this potty-mouthed morass is the will to make aesthetic and moral judgments. It's easier simply to relax and feel smug and infantile. Who is anybody to tell us tabloid television is garbage or that we're drugging ourselves on celebrity gossip and talk-show trash? And anyway, so what? Look at how well we're doing! Anyone who doesn't agree that I'm O.K. and you're O.K. is a party pooper.</p>
