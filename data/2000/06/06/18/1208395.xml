        <p>Re ''South Africa in Quandary: Should Gays Donate Blood?'' (news article, June 11):</p>
        <p>A few years ago I was walking by a blood drive. A volunteer asked me if I would be willing to donate blood. I told her that the Red Cross won't take my blood, even though I am free of disease and a universal donor.</p>
        <p>When she asked me why, I replied, ''Because I'm gay.'' Her face went white, her eyes distant, and she asked, ''Why couldn't my husband have been that up front with me?''</p>
        <p>The Red Cross's policy is based on the same bigotry that kept that woman's husband so deeply closeted that  perhaps even he didn't know he was gay when they married.</p>
        <p>I am a perfectly healthy man. I am not promiscuous and don't engage in unsafe sex. The next time you hear about an acute need for type O blood, ask yourself why the American Red Cross won't take mine.</p>
