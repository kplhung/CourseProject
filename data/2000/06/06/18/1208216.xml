        <p>AFTER months of indecision, Loews Cineplex Theaters will open a new multiplex in White Plains as originally planned -- and not in a $100 million waterfront development in Port Chester -- White Plains officials said this week.</p>
        <p>Loews was considering a 3,800-seat movie complex in the Waterfront at Port Chester, where G. &amp; S. Investors has broken ground for a downtown urban redevelopment project, which includes a two-story Costco, a super Stop 'N' Shop and a waterfront promenade.</p>
        <p>Gregg Wasser, the managing partner for G. &amp; S., said his project will move ahead whatever Loews's decision is. ''We have five other movie chains interested,'' he said, adding that a theater in Port Chester will be able to draw from Fairfield County as well as Westchester.</p>
        <p>''We can replace Loews easily,'' Mr. Wasser said. ''It will have no effect whatsoever on us.''</p>
        <p>It was a different story in White Plains, where Loews's decision was considered critical to that city's redevelopment project. Paul Wood, coordinator of economic development and public information for White Plains, said: ''Our entire deal was based on the movie theater project. We would have had to go back to Square 1 if they withdrew.''</p>
        <p>In 1998 Loews first announced its plans to open in White Plains. But negotiations with the city bogged down, and Loews announced it was considering a theater in Port Chester, adding that it might open in both places. In March, however, Loews said it was backing out of the White Plains deal.</p>
        <p>In May, a package of incentives was worked out between the city, TishmanSpeyer and Loews -- with the theater company getting a guarantee that it could break ground on its first Westchester multiplex this summer and the developer gaining $23 million in incentives from the city.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, we're very excited to have Loews on board and the project moving forward again,'' Mr. Wood said. The closest Loews Cineplex in the region is in Rockland at the Palisades Mall.</p>
        <p>In White Plains, the 21-screen, 5,200-seat cineplex will be in the former Macy's store where TishmanSpeyer Properties is building a $125 million White Plains Town Center.</p>
        <p>The interior of the White Plains multiplex will be designed by David Rockwell, the entertainment architect who designed the Mohegan Sun Casino in Connecticut. The multiplex will have indoor box offices, digital sound and a hot-food concession stand.</p>
        <p>Repeated calls to Loews were not returned.</p>
