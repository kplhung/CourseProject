        <p>George Giokas, chief executive of Staffwriters Plus Inc., shuffled out of journalism after 22 years, taking a voluntary buyout when New York Newsday closed in 1995. That hasn't stopped him from finding jobs for other journalists.</p>
        <p>Want to be the next Helen Thomas? Early this month, United Press International posted her former job, senior White House correspondent, on Mr. Giokas's Staffwriters.com job site. Travel required.</p>
        <p>Ms. Thomas, 79, who left the day after a company founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon bought U.P.I., had been the most senior White House reporter, going back to the Kennedy administration. She didn't spot her own job on the Web. ''I don't know anything about this,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Giokas did. ''I was just floored, to nonchalantly post a job like that,'' he said. Arnaud de Borchgrave, chief executive of U.P.I., said union rules required all openings to be advertised. ''It would be nice if we could find something for Helen,'' Mr. Giokas said. ''She should sign up with us; maybe we can get her some freelance work.''</p>
