      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Improvisation is one of the cornerstones of jazz and the pianist Ahmad Jamal has been surprising audiences with his originality ever since he burst on the scene with the 1953 release of ''Ahmad Jamal at the Pershing.'' His restless virtuosity keeps audiences glued to the ivories as he jumps between musical themes and counterthemes and flits between dynamics and tempo. One minute he is pounding away, and the next he will be silent. And he is known for dramatic silences as he vaults from scales to chords, from traditional to bop.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jamal was a major influence on the jazz world, inspiring the likes of Miles Davis. He is a risk taker, filling his set with diversions and surprises, and his range runs from classical to experimental to the rhythmic.</p>
