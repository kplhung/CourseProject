        <p>Donald Kalish, a former chairman of the department of philosophy at the University of California at Los Angeles, but best known as an effective organizer of demonstrations against United States involvement in Vietnam, died June 8 in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 80.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kalish lived in Los Angeles and died after a long illness, said Harlan Lebo, a spokesman for the University.</p>
        <p>As vice chairman of the Peace Action Council, Dr. Kalish helped organize a tremendous demonstration in front of the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles on June 23, 1967.</p>
        <p>About 80 antiwar groups mustered almost 10,000 protesters to gather outside the hotel while President Lyndon B. Johnson was speaking there.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kalish also publicized the idea of reducing one's income tax payment by 25 percent -- the share he calculated that was being used to support the military effort.</p>
        <p>''For 18 years, I was an ivory-towered academic,'' he told the Christian Science Monitor in 1969.</p>
        <p>''Sure, I was a liberal Democrat. I backed Stevenson and even Johnson against Goldwater.</p>
        <p>''But in 1965, my intense feelings about the Vietnam War pushed me toward issue politics.''</p>
        <p>Born in Chicago, Dr. Kalish earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in psychology as well as his doctorate in philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
        <p>After teaching briefly at Swarthmore College and at Berkeley, he joined the University of California at Los Angeles faculty in 1949. He retired in 1997.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kalish is survived by his wife, the former Ann Graham of Los Angeles.</p>
