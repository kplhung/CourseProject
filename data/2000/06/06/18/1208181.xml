        <p>ROSE STRASSBURGER was married for 60 years to Martin Strassburger. They had met as teenagers in Germany, leaving in the late 1930's before the Nazis could send them to concentration camps. They moved to New York City, married and lived in Washington Heights, which was so thick with German Jews, Mrs. Strassburger said, ''we called it the Fourth Reich.''</p>
        <p>Later, they moved to Elmhurst, Queens, and bought a two-family house where they raised their two sons, renting one half and living in the other. They commuted together every day to Manhattan, where they ran a women's accessories business. He was the talker, meeting with buyers; she did the office work. ''I was always a businesswoman,'' she said, ''even as a young girl.''</p>
        <p>Then, two years ago, her husband died, leaving her alone in a way she had never been alone. She was inconsolable. Her sons worried about her. ''The loneliness is something very bad,'' Mrs. Strassburger said. She had her work with the sisterhood at the synagogue, the Elmhurst Jewish Center, which she and her husband had helped start. But it wasn't enough.</p>
        <p>And so, six months ago, exactly 50 years to the day she had moved into her house, she left. ''My children begged me to go,'' she said. She left most of her furniture with the people who bought the house, packed up her belongings, had the moving men take her things, and locked the door behind her with absolutely no regrets. ''I don't feel sorry one bit,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Since then, she has been living at Atria in Kew Gardens, a retirement home that opened late last year at 117-01 84th Avenue. It is called an assisted-living facility because it provides meals for its 85 residents (it has room for 143) and, if needed, help with activities that might have become difficult.</p>
        <p>THIS is nothing like a nursing home. It's more like a boarding school in an attractively decorated hotel, but most people are in their 70's or 80's instead of their teens. Mrs. Strassburger lives in a large two-room apartment with a kitchenette. Although she could have some meals there, she prefers to go to the dining room. In fact, she goes downstairs early for meals, as do most of the residents, for a little socializing before it's actually time to eat.</p>
        <p>The food is kosher, she said, and very good. ''Last night we had a delicious pot roast,'' she said. ''I asked for more meat, and that was no problem.'' There are always three choices of entree; if she hadn't been in the mood for pot roast, she could have had halibut, or barbecued chicken.</p>
        <p>She has her meals at Table 14 with the same group of people. Some of the tables are made up of longtime Queens residents who have known each other for years; one consists of four women originally from Jamaica Estates.</p>
        <p>She likes the people she has met, and has not found it difficult to make friends. ''I'm a very outgoing person,'' she said. ''I greet people and I introduce myself.'' Occasionally, she goes to lectures and parties, she said, but she skips many of the other activities, which seem to be offered almost hourly. ''I'm not the type to go into arts and crafts,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For those who don't like being in their own apartments all day, there's a library with a computer; an open kitchen with coffee, tea, cookies and fruit always available; a wellness center where residents can meet with nurses and doctors; a movie room; a place to play bingo; a beauty parlor; a smoking lounge; and a private dining room for entertaining family and friends.</p>
        <p>Architecturally, the nine-story brick building with its underground parking garage fits in so well with the neighborhood that it looks like it has been there forever. It was built  by Jeff Levine, president of Levine Builders, who lives in Queens, for Atria Communities, a Louisville, Ky., company that owns 109 retirement communities nationwide.</p>
        <p>Once a month there is a ''fireside chat'' with the woman in charge, Larissa Kostal, whose own grandmother lives at Atria. ''Larissa is in the center like a queen,'' said Mrs. Strassburger, who is obviously fond of the young woman. At those talks, the residents bring up issues that concern them. Some thought breakfast, at 8, was too early, and so they had a vote on whether to change meal hours. ''Eighty-five percent voted to keep it the same,'' Mrs. Kostal said. The democratic approach makes sense to her. ''This is their home,'' she said.</p>
        <p>THE average age of the residents is 82, she said, and they pay $3,550 a month for a two-room suite with daily housekeeping and a thorough weekly apartment cleaning, plus all their meals, with additional charges for nursing care if needed. Many residents, she said, take antidepressant medication, which doesn't surprise her given what they must cope with at their age. ''It's all about loss,'' she said. ''Some are outliving their children. They get here and they're all in the same boat together.''</p>
        <p>When Mrs. Strassburger moved in, she brought the mezuzah -- a piece of parchment inscribed with a passage from Deuteronomy that is encased and affixed to the doorpost of a  house -- from her old home. ''That's the first thing you put in a home when you move in,'' she said. A wall in her bedroom holds a plaque in appreciation from her synagogue.</p>
        <p>''I'm still very active there,'' she said. ''That was my heart and soul.'' The rabbi visits her once a week.</p>
        <p>On a typical day, she'll make phone calls after breakfast, to her friends and family, which includes  five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. After lunch, she tends to take a nap, and watch her favorite soap opera, ''General Hospital.'' After dinner, at about 7, she returns to her rooms for the night.</p>
        <p>She is particularly impressed by the skilled housekeeping at Atria.  ''The cleanliness in this house is something out of the ordinary,'' she said. She no longer has to work in the yard, which was tedious to her, or even clean up a kitchen. ''My fingernails are so nice from not doing dishes,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, she says, ''there is nothing missing here.'' And how do her sons feel about the move they encouraged her to make? ''They are happy because I'm happy,'' she said. ''Now, they are calling me only two times a day.''</p>
