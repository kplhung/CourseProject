        <p>When hunters came across the wreckage of an aircraft on a remote mountainside in April, Capt. David B. Webb of the 49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard volunteered to join an Air Force team sent to figure out whose plane it might be.</p>
        <p>Captain Webb, an operations officer at the American headquarters here, had no particular experience in recovery operations, but he had an expertise that even the airmen did not: When not on active duty, he works in Fort Worth for Lockheed Martin, maker of the F-16.</p>
        <p>And as it turned out, the wreckage he helped identify was the F-16 belonging to Capt. Scott O'Grady, the American pilot shot down on June 2, 1995, during NATO's air raids in Bosnia.</p>
        <p>''I see F-16's every day on the floor,'' said Captain Webb, a 34-year-old property manager for Lockheed, who has served in the National Guard for 14 years. ''To see one in pieces when I got to Bosnia was, well, strange.''</p>
        <p>For years, the National Guard and Reserves have had to endure lingering doubts within the regular Army that their part-time soldiers have what it takes to carry out important military operations. But as the Army relies more heavily on Guard and Reserve units, Guard and Reserve commanders argue that the nation's citizen-soldiers bring something else that their active-duty counterparts cannot: experience and skills honed in the civilian world.</p>
        <p>Indeed, when it comes to peacekeeping operations like the one here in Bosnia, which does not involve direct combat, there are many who argue that the Guard and Reserve are in fact better prepared for the subtle tasks of rebuilding a nation devastated by war.</p>
        <p>''This is only a personal opinion, but in the National Guard, we deal with civilians a little better,'' said Lt. John K. Bahrami, a computer consultant for I.B.M. and a member of the 49th Armored Division, who serves in the unit overseeing security here at Eagle Base, the American headquarters near the town of Tuzla. ''We're business people. We work with people. You don't have that sense they do in the regular Army that everyone is either a friend or an enemy.''</p>
        <p>Since the nearly 650 men and women of the 49th were deployed here in March, its officers have commanded the American peacekeeping mission, trying to advance a peace that, more than four years after the fighting stopped, is still struggling to take hold.</p>
        <p>It is the first time since the Korean War that the Army has deployed a Guard headquarters overseas and the first time ever that it has put one in charge of regular Army troops -- in this case, 2,500 soldiers from one of the service's elite cadres, the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment from Fort Carson, Colo., as well as 40 reservists, and nearly 1,000 guardsmen from a dozen states.</p>
        <p>Until they mobilized in February, the men and women of the 49th were computer programmers, teachers, lawyers and laborers -- and their skills have already paid dividends.</p>
        <p>In some cases, civilian skills are incidental to the military mission, as happened with Captain Webb. When the Air Force team arrived at the wreckage on the remote hillside near the Croatian border, it was Captain Webb who knew that a stamp on a bulkhead identified it as an F-16 and a contract number on another part showed it was an American Air Force jet.</p>
        <p>In other cases, it is by design. Since the Vietnam era, the Army has deliberately transferred soldiers with specific skills to the Reserve, especially doctors and nurses, press officers and civil affairs specialists who serve as liaisons to local communities. These reservists are among the busiest in the Army today.</p>
        <p>''Show me where the Army has an investment banker or someone who runs an electrical grid,'' said Brig. Gen. Bruce B. Bingham, a reservist who is commander of the Army's Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command and partner in the accounting firm BDO Seidman in New York City. ''We bring civilian skills that the Army doesn't have.''</p>
        <p>By the measures that matter most to the Army and the Pentagon -- avoiding casualties and keeping a lid on sporadic eruptions of violence -- the 49th's mission has so far been a success. But the 49th is also winning praise from unexpected quarters, including critics of the American operation who credit the National Guard with bringing a civilian sensibility to what has been a solely military mission.</p>
        <p>The 49th's commander, Maj. Gen. Robert L. Halverson, who served as deputy commissioner of insurance for the State of Texas before retiring when the deployment order came, has made his highest priority the return of Bosnia's refugees to their homes. One of the most difficult areas is the village of Srebrenica, where Serbian soldiers drove out the Muslim population and killed as many as 8,000 men.</p>
        <p>Hoping to help clear the way for Srebrenica's former residents to return, General Halverson sent the division's chief engineer, Col. Larry N. Patterson, to inspect the city's damaged water system. It was no coincidence that Colonel Patterson, when not on active duty, is the assistant director of the Water Utilities Department for the City of Dallas.</p>
        <p>Despite the lack of cooperation from Serbian workers, he inspected the plant and was able to determine the purification process the plant once used when he spotted a discarded chemical control panel.</p>
        <p>''Tell me who else could walk beside that water treatment plant and look at a piece of metal trash lying in the weeds and recognize it as a chemical control panel,'' General Halverson said in a recent interview.</p>
        <p>Colonel Patterson has served in the Texas National Guard ever since he graduated from the Reserve Officers Training Corps program at Texas A &amp; M University in 1972, rising through the ranks as both an officer and as an engineer in the water utility industry. He had little idea his experience providing water for nearly two million people in Dallas would come in handy in a place like Bosnia.</p>
        <p>Within days of his visit to the plant, however, Colonel Patterson outlined what the plant would need to produce minimally potable water and an estimate of the cost: $266,701.</p>
        <p>The next step is to try to coordinate the necessary repairs in meetings Colonel Patterson has with officials in charge of the civilian aspects of the Dayton peace accords, as well as other military engineers and representatives of aid agencies.</p>
        <p>''It's sort of like going to a city council meeting back home,'' Colonel Patterson said, reaching back to his civilian life for the right explanation. ''You have 15 different districts and they all have competing interests. Hopefully, we can get something done. Everybody wants to do something for Srebrenica.''</p>
        <p>For the Pentagon, the success or failure of the 49th's mission will shape overseas operations for years. Throughout the cold war, the National Guard was literally held in reserve. Its units -- serving under the command of the governors of 50 states, the District of Colombia and three territories -- evolved into a distinct force, separate and unequal. Guardsmen were activated more often for natural disasters than military operations, leading to derision from full-time soldiers and commanders.</p>
        <p>Now, as the pace of military operations has increased, from the Balkans to the Persian Gulf, the Army plans to turn more and more to its 564,000 reservists and guardsmen to relieve the strain on its nearly 480,000 regular troops.</p>
        <p>Here in Bosnia, as in other operations, the Army is planning to increase the participation of Guard units. Today, the Guard and Reserve constitute nearly a quarter of the American troops in Bosnia; by 2003, nearly two-thirds of the troops here will be part-time citizen-soldiers, called up for nine months at a time.</p>
        <p>While the 49th largely provides the headquarters staff at the main American base, the next rotations will include operation units, which officials say will become a greater test of the Guard's contribution. Those units include the 48th Infantry Brigade from Georgia, a unit that was activated during the Persian Gulf war, but then deemed by Army commanders to be unprepared to go into combat in the desert.</p>
        <p>[A new study by the General Accounting Office noted significant improvements in training of brigades like the 48th, but said that many of them still faced shortfalls in combat readiness.]</p>
        <p>For the 49th, the assignment here has been a chance to prove the Guard's abilities after having sat on the sidelines for decades. And they point to achievements like Captain Webb's and Colonel Patterson's.</p>
        <p>''This wasn't just any mission for us,'' said Col. Garry D. Patterson, the division's chief of staff and Larry Patterson's twin brother. ''We felt like we had to make a mark on the wall for the ones that are going to follow us.''</p>
        <p>The performance of the 49th to date appears to have impressed not just Army commanders, but also critics of the American presence in Bosnia since NATO troops arrived in December 1995.</p>
        <p>Dr. James Lyon, the Bosnia director of the International Crisis Group, a private foundation that has been very critical of developments since the Dayton accord, credits the National Guard for changing the tenor of the American operations. With the war over, he said, the biggest challenge in Bosnia today is not separating armies, but working more actively with the local governments and international organizations who in effect make Bosnia tick.</p>
        <p>Since the 49th arrived, Dr. Lyon said he had seen a greater coordination with international organizations and local governments, as well as increased foot patrols in tense villages, despite an overall reduction in American troops from 6,900 two years ago to today's level of 4,200.</p>
        <p>''I wish the National Guard had come in 1996,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Changing Of the Guard</p>
        <p>This is one of several articles about the 49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard describing the troops' deployment in Bosnia, where the unit is taking over command of the American Sector of a NATO peacekeeping force.</p>
