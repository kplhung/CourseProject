        <p>Remembrance Day</p>
        <p>By Henry Porter.</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster, $25.</p>
        <p>This smart, intricate thriller begins when a bomb explodes on a London bus. One minute an Irish biologist named Con Lindow is standing on a street corner admiring a pretty woman; the next, he is on his back, drenched in her blood. British authorities arrest Lindow -- who was peripherally involved in an I.R.A. incident almost two decades before -- for planting the bomb, and the novel chronicles his attempts to vindicate himself. He is helped by a disaffected antiterrorist officer from Scotland Yard and also by a mysterious spy, who becomes his lover. Their quest takes on urgency as the true bomber is revealed to be brilliant, ambitious and on a murderous rampage. He tricks bystanders -- including Lindow -- into making phone calls that detonate bombs. One of his devices is planted in a computer, to be activated via e-mail. (Understanding exactly how these devices work sometimes requires a tolerance for long, technical explanations.) Thrillers are well served by diabolical killers, and in this promising first novel, Henry Porter has created a suitably unpleasant one in a British agent named Ian Rhodes. But his appearances are far too brief and shadowy, as if the messy and often preposterous details of a twisted human psyche do not really belong in the sleek new world of high-tech crime. This novel is not about how and why a man becomes a mad bomber. It's about encryption, cellular communications and ingenious booby traps. All of which are creepy and chilling, if not quite sufficient for building a great work of suspense fiction.</p>
