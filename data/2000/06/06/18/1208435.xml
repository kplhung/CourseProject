      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Jill Sobule, singer-songwriter, had a big problem in 1995. She had a hit record, the amiably innocent, homoerotic ''I Kissed a Girl.'' She became a one-hit wonder. At least to those who never took the time to listen to her subsequent recordings.</p>
        <p>After her second album, ''Happy Town,'' failed to produce another hit (how much ''coming out'' can one girl do?) she was dropped by her label. But Ms. Sobule persevered releasing the compelling ''Pink Pearl'' on an independent label. Now she sings about dumb boyfriends, weight-obsessed women, Alzheimer's disease and the failings of a long list of celebrated people, all couched in a deceptively sweet style covering many musical styles like hip-hop, lounge, bossa nova, acoustic folk, rock and torpid country-blues (''The Guy Who Doesn't Get It''). With a wicked wit and pliant facility for candor, Ms. Sobule is an artist whose talent goes well beyond whom she kisses.</p>
