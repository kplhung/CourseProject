        <p>IT is a small, rundown auto repair shop on Townsend Avenue, wedged between a row of rooming houses and the water's edge in this historic industrial village on the banks of the Byram River.</p>
        <p>If he got his way, the proprietor, Roqui A. Vallejo, would keep working here, the way he has since he arrived from Ecuador and opened his business seven years ago. But his space is needed by a developer who is building a Costco, a Stop 'N' Shop and a multiplex theater, creating a riverfront shopping plaza that will displace much of downtown Port Chester, Mr. Vallejo included.</p>
        <p>The relocation of Mr. Vallejo and 170 other residents and merchants has been touted by Westchester officials as a model effort of sensitivity and professionalism. Paul J. Noto, a county legislator from Mamaroneck, made this point at a recent Board of Legislators meeting where the county agreed to finance part of the project.</p>
        <p>But to some of the business owners who are being forced to relocate, things have been anything but smooth.</p>
        <p>They say the process has been frightening, humiliating or unfair, according to personal accounts and court papers filed against the village in State Supreme Court in White Plains.</p>
        <p>The developer chosen by the village, G. &amp; S. Investors of Old Bethpage, on Long Island, has engaged in ''outrageous and improper conduct,'' according to a motion to stop the project filed Tuesday by Michael Rikon, a lawyer with the Manhattan firm Goldstein Goldstein &amp; Rikon. He has asked that all condemnation proceedings be vacated, arguing, among other things, that people have been improperly evicted or harassed, minorities have been discriminated against and threats have been made to ruin people economically.</p>
        <p>Gregg Wasser, a G. &amp; S. principal, strongly disputed those claims, calling Mr. Rikon's motion ''really a disgrace.'' He said Mr. Rikon was frustrated by G. &amp; S.'s ability to come to friendly settlements with all the landowners in the first half of the development zone, thus denying Mr. Rikon larger fees for representing those landowners. He said that G. &amp; S. has also settled with all the merchants in the first area slated for development, except for Mr. Vallejo, and that condemnation battles in court have so far been avoided.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wasser said he was considering legal action against the people making the charges against him and his partner, Stanley Perelman.</p>
        <p>John E. Watkins Jr., special counsel to the village, said: ''We deny the allegations made in those papers. We believe that all statutory requirements have been followed and the village, as the developer, has made every possible effort to deal appropriately with the owners in the affected areas and the tenants, both commercial and residential.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Watkins added that most of the allegations ''don't make any sense.''</p>
        <p>The National Institute for Justice, a libertarian public interest law firm, has opened an investigation to decide if it will defend property owners. Dana Berliner, senior lawyer with the institute, said she was astounded by how the village has acted so far.</p>
        <p>''They did a good job in this situation of selecting people who would be disorganized and defenseless against the onslaught of government power,'' Ms. Berliner said. ''Small business owners who are not large enough to organize themselves into any resistance and, of course, immigrants who aren't used to the kinds of organizing you need to do to fight these things off.''</p>
        <p>That notion has been echoed on village streets. Many say that the minorities and new immigrants who are being forced out are being hit the hardest.</p>
        <p>''I believe they are deliberately targeting this project to get rid of Hispanics and other minorities,'' said Joan H. Bischoff Van Heemskerck, the owner of Mediterranean Living, an importer on Don Bosco Place, who has retained Mr. Rikon. ''It makes no sense. It's not right.''</p>
        <p>Christine Korff, the village mayor, said she ''would flatly deny'' allegations of racial or ethnic discrimination. She said that waterfront development in Port Chester has been talked about for 30 years and that anyone who either bought or rented property in the village knew well in advance about the plans.</p>
        <p>Workers broke ground for the first half of the $100 million project on June 1, and G. &amp; S., backed by the village, has struck deals with 46 of 83 families it must relocate, giving tenants $3,000 on top of the $1,000 given by the village.</p>
        <p>''We're doing a lot to help people on an individualized basis,'' said Mary Amelia, a G. &amp; S. employee who is relocating people, often into better housing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wasser said the success rate proves how smoothly the process is going.</p>
        <p>Some who have settled with G. &amp; S. and the village said they are quite satisfied, even if negotiations over property values have been tense. ''Well, it started out very bad and then we got to understand each other,'' said Louis DiLeo, a village landowner who retained Mr. Rikon before settling. ''I think G. &amp; S. is trying to do the best they can to make everybody happy.''</p>
        <p>One of Mr. DiLeo's former tenants, James R. Coughlin, a co-owner of Iso Plastics Corporation, which has relocated to Mount Vernon, said: ''Everything on our end was positive. It went favorably. We didn't run into any problems with G. &amp; S. or with the village.''</p>
        <p>Negotiations with residential and commercial tenants and landowners in the second phase of the project have not yet begun.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wasser said, ''Over the next three months we will make peace with all of the people in Phase 2.''</p>
        <p>But two of the landowners in that area have hired their own lawyer, Charles B. McGroddy, of the Katonah firm Covey Roberts Buchanan &amp; McGroddy. One of them wants to ensure he is adequately paid for his property, and the other would prefer not to move at all, Mr. McGroddy said.</p>
        <p>''I think they are doing a terrible job,'' Mr. McGroddy said of the village's efforts. ''I think they are trampling the rights of the citizens. I think they are trampling the rights of the property owners.''</p>
        <p>Besides Mr. Vallejo, Pablo Torres, a Dominican grocer; Robinson Plasencia, a Peruvian baker; and others who run small shops on South Main Street have retained Mr. Rikon to ensure that they are adequately relocated and get fully paid for the fixtures in their stores.</p>
        <p>Mr. Plasencia, who has run Nino International Bakery for 12 years, said he has been offered $25,000 to relocate. ''But $25,000 is not enough,'' he said. ''I need at least $100,000. What about the years I worked to make a business here?''</p>
        <p>William W. Koeppel, another of Mr. Rikon's clients, who has run Megamat Laundromat on South Main Street for two years, said that his property has been appraised at $2 million and when he told Mr. Perelman that he had hired Mr. Rikon, their relationship turned ugly.</p>
        <p>''I am going to destroy you,'' Mr. Perelman, a G. &amp; S. principal, told Mr. Koeppel, according to Mr. Koeppel's affidavit filed with Mr. Rikon's motion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wasser denies that his partner made such a statement.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mr. Vallejo leaned against a Chevrolet Nova and said his problems over his garage are keeping him up at night.</p>
        <p>Up the road, Raymond Spizzirri, a barber  who once trimmed Ed Sullivan's hair, said he is close to giving in and retiring, as his wife and sons have urged.</p>
        <p>''It is sad,'' Mr. Spizzirri said. ''I have been here for so many years. What we should have done is, We should have all gotten together and fought. But it's progress. You can't change progress. It's tough.''</p>
