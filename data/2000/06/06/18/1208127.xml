        <p>COMPETITIONS, in any field, rarely determine excellence in an absolute sense. At best, they can only hope to identify entrants who most closely meet the ideals of that particular contest. In ballet competitions the sieve can be very fine indeed.</p>
        <p>''We judge what we estimate is the quality of a dancer: the humility, the musicality, the phrasing, the contact with the audience,'' said the choreographer Jean-Christophe Maillot during a recent visit to New York. Mr. Maillot, the director of the Ballets de Monte Carlo and a past medalist as well as a judge of the Prix de Lausanne, a competition for very young ballet dancers, is serving as a judge for the New York International Ballet Competition, which is taking place this week at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center. The contestants are older than in the Swiss contest: the women will be from 17 to 23 and the men from 18 to 24.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maillot expects to be ''less tolerant'' in New York. For him, the contestants here ''should be people who have a sense of responsibility to themselves, and who are no longer under a teacher's influence.''</p>
        <p>''They will show not who they are but who they think they are,'' he continued. ''And it's important to look for that: it's the only thing that can make ballet technique, ballet itself, go on.''</p>
        <p>New Yorkers will have the chance to judge the judges -- and possibly see some future stars -- during the third and final week of competition, which is open to the public from Wednesday through Sunday. In the past, audiences could have seen, among others, three dancers now with American Ballet Theater: Jose Manuel Carreno of Cuba won the gold medal in 1987, Gillian Murphy of the United States was a finalist in 1996 and Carlos Molina of Colombia took the Igor Youskevitch Award for male dancers in 1996.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1983 by the dancer Ilona Copen, who serves as its executive director, the competition takes place every three years. Unlike other ballet competitions, in which contestants compete as individuals and bring a prepared repertory, this one evaluates dancers largely on their performance of pas de deux that they learn only after they get to New York. (The repertory is different at each meet.)</p>
        <p>Because skill in partnering is part of the judging, dancers must apply as couples, though only individuals can advance in the standings, and each dancer is therefore asked to prepare a solo.</p>
        <p>This year's 24 couples were selected from more than 60 who applied, some from far-flung countries (five couples applied from a single school in Mongolia; one of them was chosen to compete). During the first two weeks, the dancers learned three pas de deux: ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux'' by George Balanchine; the ''Giggling Rapids'' section of ''The River'' by Alvin Ailey; and a specially devised version of the climactic pas de deux from Act III of ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' originally choreographed by Marius Petipa. Throughout the three-week period, the contestants also take hour-and-a-half classes daily from the competition's faculty, which this year includes the ballerina Lupe Serrano, who regularly conducts company class at American Ballet Theater, where she once starred.</p>
        <p>All dance competitions have a paradox at their core: on one hand, the dancers struggle to ''do it right,'' to understand what is expected of them, and on the other, the judges hope to find dancers who will deliver the unexpected within a formally controlled context.</p>
        <p>Cynthia Gregory, a former Ballet Theater star and the president of the panel of judges for the competition, has also served as a coach at the event and appreciates this paradox. ''It's what's between the steps that makes a dancer,'' she said. ''When you're young, you don't know that. Right away, there's something about a dancer you pick up on. Once you've seen that, you look for technique, purity of line. But you look for that certain something that's not attainable by teaching.''</p>
        <p>Winthrop Corey, a former principal with the National Ballet of Canada and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, who coached  contestants in the ''Sleeping Beauty'' pas de deux, is responsible for showing the dancers the language they will speak and the etiquette they must observe.</p>
        <p>The version of the pas de deux he taught is essentially the one he learned from the Bolshoi dancers Alla Khaniashvili and Vitaly Artyushkin, who have performed it in Alabama with the Mobile Ballet, where Mr. Corey is the artistic director. The Bolshoi version does not include the bravura ''fish dives'' in the adagio that Western audiences are used to; however, in consultation with Eleanor D'Antuono, the competition's artistic director, this flourish has been included. The pas de deux will be danced to a tape of the Tchaikovsky played by the Bolshoi orchestra, whose tempos Mr. Corey has digitally altered, the way a ballet conductor would in live performance, to accommodate the choreography.</p>
        <p>''It's a very exact style,'' Mr. Corey said. ''Somewhat understated, extremely elegant. Yet even though they may be walking to the same eight counts, one has a slightly different tilt to the head or an expression on the face. We make them do the same steps so we can judge them; however, we don't take away their passion.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Ms. Copen is thinking of the dancers' experience in a different light. ''Here comes a couple from, say, Uzbekistan,'' she said. ''They've never been to New York before, and after three weeks they go home and show their peers Alvin Ailey's 'Giggling Rapids.' How fantastic: it will open eyes.''</p>
