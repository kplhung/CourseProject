        <p>To the Editor</p>
        <p>''Trading More Now for Less Later'' (Economic View, May 28) says Social Security recipients might be sensible to wait until the age of 70 to begin taking retirement benefits, because the monthly payments are higher.</p>
        <p>The analysis used, however, is flawed.</p>
        <p>In an example, the column says the monthly payment at 70 would be $1,300 for someone who passed up $1,000 at age 65. Those numbers are approximately correct for someone who is reaching 65 this year, with the payments increasing 6 percent for each year deferred. But that increase does not necessarily mean that deferral is a good bet.</p>
        <p>A retiree starting $1,000 payments at 65 would receive $60,000 during the 60 months before turning 70. At the higher rate of $1,300 a month, it would take 200 months, or almost 17 years, to recoup, when the recipient  would be almost 87.</p>
        <p>There's more. If the retiree had enough resources to eschew payments until age 70, then the earlier amounts could have been invested.  Assuming a conservative after-tax return of 5 percent, there would be an additional $10,000 in the pot; the breakeven point would then come a few months before the 90th birthday celebration. Of course, if the original $60,000 gain keeps earning 5 percent, there will almost never be a day of reckoning.</p>
        <p>Deferral does not sound like a very good bet to me; when I turned 65 this year, I did not make it.</p>
