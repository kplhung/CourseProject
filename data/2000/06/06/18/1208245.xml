        <p>DEAR DIARY: My wife, Mary, hung a birdhouse on the porch of our house in Matawan with a ''FOR WRENT'' sign. Sure enough a wren couple moved in and had babies, who now keep jabbering all day. I would like to amend the sign to read ''FOR WRENT (cheep).''</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY: My wife, Mary, hung a birdhouse on the porch of our house in Matawan with a ''FOR WRENT'' sign. Sure enough a wren couple moved in and had babies, who now keep jabbering all day. I would like to amend the sign to read ''FOR WRENT (cheep).''</p>
        <p>BOB McKENTY</p>
        <p>Speaking of birds, a raccoon was raiding our bird feeders -- not just eating but taking them from the tree and dropping them. Our tree lady  said other customers had recommended playing a radio all night near the feeders, though she didn't think that was useful.</p>
        <p>''Hell's bells,'' she said. ''They just change the station if they don't like the music.''</p>
        <p>VERDI JOHNSON</p>
        <p>My wife was driving in Hillsdale when a car edged out from a side street and nearly blocked her way. She blew her horn vigorously; the other driver stopped (finally) and blew his in annoyance. As we drove off, my wife tapped the horn lightly and said to me, ''I had the last horn.''</p>
        <p>CHARLES KESSELMAN</p>
        <p>CRAZY PASS</p>
        <p>E-ZPass makes me insane,</p>
        <p>I never get in the right lane.</p>
        <p>All the signals just confound me,</p>
        <p>While other autos zip around me.</p>
        <p>Changing lanes just makes me queasy,</p>
        <p>E-ZPass is not so easy.</p>
        <p>MARILYN COHEN VASSEN</p>
        <p>To the Borough of Fort Lee:</p>
        <p>''This is to advise you that I received your 'reminder about snow removal' on May 2 along with the advice on the size of the numbers of my home 'visible from the street.' I apologize for the delay in my response. Perhaps the fact that I live on the 18th floor of a high-rise building may be a reason for the delay.''</p>
        <p>ROBERT H. BERKLEY</p>
        <p>I called an 800 number to get a  part for an appliance. The conversation went like this:</p>
        <p>He: ''We have the part, but our business is strictly over the counter.''</p>
        <p>Me: ''Where are you?''</p>
        <p>He: In Somerville (gives the address).</p>
        <p>Me: O.K. I'll go there.</p>
        <p>At that point I got out a map of New Jersey and found Somerville but could not pin down the street. I called back.</p>
        <p>Me: ''We need explicit directions.''</p>
        <p>He: ''What road are you coming on?''</p>
        <p>Me: ''287 South.''</p>
        <p>He: ''I don't know that road. Where are you coming from?''</p>
        <p>Me: ''Chatham.''</p>
        <p>He: ''Oh, the Cape.''</p>
        <p>I knew I would have to go somewhere else for the part.</p>
        <p>WARREN. H. WENDELL</p>
        <p>I was visiting my mother at the Morris Hills Center nursing facility, who introduced me to an aide.</p>
        <p>''This is my daughter,'' Mom said proudly.</p>
        <p>''Your daughter?'' the well-meaning aide blurted. ''You look like sisters.''</p>
        <p>''Thank you,'' Mom said with a  smile.</p>
        <p>''Thank you,'' I muttered.</p>
        <p>AUDREY CORN</p>
        <p>FATHER OF THE BRIDE</p>
        <p>With his checkbook at the ready</p>
        <p>Stands the father of the bride</p>
        <p>With his pen poised firm and steady,</p>
        <p>His demeanor filled with pride.</p>
        <p>Today will be a fun day</p>
        <p>(It's his daughter's taste of heaven).</p>
        <p>The checks won't bounce till Monday</p>
        <p>When he files Chapter Eleven.</p>
