        <p>This summer Rutgers University will begin the four-year process of installing sprinklers in  dormitory rooms that do not now have them, which will raise room and board costs by $150 a year. Over all its campuses, the university has about 7,500 double dormitory rooms and 500 apartments for married students. About one-third have sprinklers. To pay for the work, Rutgers expects a $30 million no-interest state loan through a bill now being before the Legislature. The bill, which requires sprinklers in all collegehousing, was prompted by a fatal fire at Seton Hall University earlier this year. The loan will be repaid by adding $40 to room and board costs starting in September 2001 and gradually increasing to $150 in four years. When the loan is repaid the fee will be taken off, Mr. Kozack.</p>
