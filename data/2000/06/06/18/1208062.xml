        <p>WINDCHILL SUMMER</p>
        <p>By Norris Church Mailer.</p>
        <p>395 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Random House. $24.95.</p>
        <p>Sweet Valley, Ark., the setting of Norris Church Mailer's smoothly written, sweetly sentimental first novel, is an archetypal sleepy Southern town of the kind that seems to exist only in coming-of-age novels. But in the summer of 1969, even the residents of Sweet Valley have noticed that the world seems to be going crazy. Boys are coming back from Vietnam with recurring nightmares and strange smoking habits. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. are dead. When the battered body of Carlene Moore, a down-and-out single mother, is hauled from the lake, it looks to Cherry Marshall, Mailer's gawkily gorgeous heroine (''I am 5 foot 11* -well, all right, 5 foot 12'') as if the chickens are coming home to roost. ''It has gotten to the point that I hate to pick up the paper in the morning,'' she says. ''Between the war and the assassins and the maniacs, who is going to get slaughtered next?''</p>
        <p>But as Mailer (who is married to Norman Mailer) tells her story, the greatest danger Cherry faces is getting caught in embarrassing period costumes and romance-novel cliches. For this virginal college senior, this is the belated summer of love, not to mention some serious miniskirt-ripping sex. Soon Cherry takes up with the mysterious Tripp Barlow, a hunky veteran from California with long golden locks, whom she spots shoveling salt at the pickle plant where she and her best friend, Baby, a 100 percent ''Arkansas redneck'' who just happens to be Filipino, are working for the summer. ''Jesus Christ was the only thing I could compare it to,'' Cherry gushes. As it happens, Tripp has got the hippie gospel thing down pat. ''Wow! I could get into this church thing,'' he tells Cherry after tracking her down at the First Apostolic Holiness Church one Sunday. ''It was weirder than an acid trip!'' Later, he puts it more philosophically: ''As the man said, 'Religion is the opiate of the masses.' ''For their part, the congregation and its standard-issue preacher are apparently too stoned on fire and brimstone to notice when Tripp opens a head shop, the Family Hand, right under their noses, complete with a water bed, psychedelic murals painted by Cherry and Baby, and a black-light room ''where you can lie back and groove to some sounds.'' All the secondhand smoke blows Cherry's mind -- I felt an excitement like the pioneers must have felt, knowing they were starting a whole new way of life'' -- but the whole thing seems about as harmless, and as convincing, as a production of ''Hair'' in a church basement.</p>
        <p>Most of the story is told by Cherry in the first person, and she's a likable enough narrator: spunky, good-hearted, loose-limbed, kind of a young Julia Roberts without the edge of animating resentment. But all too often she comes off as 21 going on 16. ''I am almost scared to say it out loud, but it seems to me like either God is all-powerful or He is all good, but He can't be both,'' she confides early on. She is shocked -- shocked! -- to discover that the Water Witch, the posh Chinese restaurant on the lake where Carlene and Baby used to work, holds banquets where judges and lawyers smoke weed and fondle the help. After sneaking away to watch ''a great new movie called 'Easy Rider,' ''she starts crying in the parking lot. ''I think that the world is full of an awful lot of hate-filled people,'' she says indignantly. ''I mean, who were those guys hurting?''</p>
        <p>Mailer refers to the simmering social tensions of the period but never really engages them. Some attention is given to Baby's conflicted identity, but racial unease largely seems to have passed Sweet Valley by. Cherry recalls how an African-American classmate named Queen Esther -- a friend ''since we integrated in the eighth grade'' -- gave her a copy of ''Soul on Ice.'' ''I got a whole new insight into black people, I can tell you. The words just cracked off the page and hit me in the face while I read it'' -- not that she has another word to say on the subject. And then there are the Manson murders, dispatched a few paragraphs later. ''I tell you, with everything that has happened in the last few weeks, it is enough to make anybody paranoid,'' Cherry says. ''The only good thing that has happened is that concert they had up north at Woodstock.'' This is the 60's as a three-minute greatest-hits medley, sung to a bubblegum beat and forgotten as soon as it's over.</p>
        <p>Like the teenage draftees from Arkansas, the reader may look forward to Vietnam as an escape from cloying small-town life. And Mailer's evocation of the war -- in flashbacks of tunnel warfare from the point of view of Baby's psychotic boyfriend, Bean, and in letters exchanged between Carlene and her high school sweetheart, Jerry, before he's blown to bits by a land mine -- broadens out her story in a way that Cherry's putatively awakening consciousness never does. In a gutsy move, Mailer gives Tripp and Jerry roles in the massacre at My Lai, and Jerry's guilt-racked confessions to Carlene feed back into and quicken the desultory investigation of her own murder. But even here the exploration of 60's foreign tragedy runs up against the hoariest plot twist of 90's domestic melodrama. When Carlene confides in Jerry about murdering the father who raped her as a child, he writes back, ''You have been through your own war.''</p>
        <p>The last quarter of the book works up some genuine suspense, with Mailer deftly cutting between the tangled subplots, trying on bad guys for size before fingering Carlene's killer. But in her gently nostalgic vision, nothing and no one stays bad for long. The cool blast of evil, like the deceptive wind chill on a sweltering summer day that gives Mailer her title, serves only to make the emotional temperature in Sweet Valley seem an even more comfortably heartwarming 72 degrees. At the end of the book, Cherry is startled to realize she had forgotten all about the antiwar demonstration she helped plan that is suddenly filling the streets. Queen Esther launches into ''We Shall Overcome'' and everyone joins in. (Even Tripp's Vietnamese wife, who has arrived to claim her man, knows the words.) The Army investigator who shows up to question Tripp about My Lai turns out to be ''a good, decent guy'' and they cry together. Even Cherry's draft-dodging cousin, the intriguingly named G. Dub, is soon sending postcards reassuring everyone that he ''loves it up there'' in Vancouver. As for Cherry, she's taking her long legs to New York City to try her luck as a model. After all, she says, ''I never pretended to be deep.''</p>
