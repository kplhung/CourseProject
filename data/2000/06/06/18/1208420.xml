        <p>As federal prosecutors announced their crackdown Wednesday on organized-crime ties to Wall Street, a familiar name popped up among the relative unknowns charged with a raft of misdeeds that included stock manipulation, money laundering and pension fund fraud: Gene Phillips, former head of the Southmark Corporation, a public real estate partnership in Dallas. Southmark, which sold many of its partnerships to individuals, sank into bankruptcy in 1989, leaving investors with $1 billion in losses.</p>

        <p>As federal prosecutors announced their crackdown Wednesday on organized-crime ties to Wall Street, a familiar name popped up among the relative unknowns charged with a raft of misdeeds that included stock manipulation, money laundering and pension fund fraud: Gene Phillips, former head of the Southmark Corporation, a public real estate partnership in Dallas. Southmark, which sold many of its partnerships to individuals, sank into bankruptcy in 1989, leaving investors with $1 billion in losses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Phillips remained in real estate, running companies that managed properties held in publicly traded partnerships like National Realty and American Realty Trust. In their indictment of Mr. Phillips last week, prosecutors said he had caused American Realty to issue preferred stock where 20 percent of the proceeds was to be secretly kicked back to what prosecutors called a criminal organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Phillips, who was out of the country when the indictment was issued, was arrested upon his return to Dallas, and is now free on a $1 million bond. His lawyer said on Friday that he had not read the indictment and could not comment.</p>
        <p>Lori Bailey, a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Dallas, said that while he awaits trial, Mr. Phillips must wear an electronic monitor. His house is so large, however, that agents had to install three monitoring stations where typically one is needed. ''We wanted to make sure he didn't get lost,'' Ms. Bailey said.</p>
