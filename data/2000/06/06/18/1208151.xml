        <p>WHAT'S in a name? If the name is Mozart, plenty.

The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, published in 1992, credited the score to Benedikt Schack and Franz Xaver Gerl, noting that one comic duet, with a soprano part for a character who can no longer speak but only meows like a cat, was orchestrated ''and perhaps partly composed'' by Mozart.</p>

        <p>WHAT'S in a name? If the name is Mozart, plenty. The playbill for the premiere of the ''brand new heroic-comic opera'' ''Der Stein der Weisen, Oder Die Zauberinsel'' (''The Philosophers' Stone, or The Enchanted Island'') at the Theater auf der Wieden in suburban Vienna in September 1790, listed as author Emanuel Schikaneder, who ran the theater, but no composer.

        <p>The existence of the duet and its attribution, long known to scholars, never sufficed to raise the opera from the obscurity in which it had lain since its last known performance, in 1814. Yet fortune smiled in 1997, when David J. Buch, a professor of music history and literature at the University of Northern Iowa, announced his discovery of documentary evidence to support Mozart's authorship not only of the meowing duet but also of two other brief sections of the score. The same source attributed other numbers to Schikaneder himself and to his 21-year-old Kapellmeister at the Theater auf der Wieden, Johann Baptist Henneberg, bringing the number of musical collaborators to five: three of them (Gerl, Schack and Schikaneder) also stars in the original cast.</p>
        <p>The running time for the three Mozart snippets adds up to five minutes out of nearly two hours of music, but with Mozart, it does not take much to reach critical mass. In 1997, The New York Times reported Mr. Buch's find on the front page, and the music world took note. Boston Baroque, directed by Martin Pearlman, presented the modern premiere of ''Der Stein der Weisen'' in a concert version a year later, following up with a serviceable recording on Telarc.</p>
        <p>Matters have by no means rested there. Late last month, ''Der Stein'' -- in a crisp English translation by the noted critic and scholar Barry Millington -- received its British concert premiere at the Hampstead and Highgate Festival, conducted by Harry Bicket. Two numbers from the score have also made their way into a baffling production of ''Die Zauberflote'' at the Schillertheater in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, a regional house of respectable standing. Mr. Buch reports that Augsburg, Germany, and Helsinki, Finland, have contracted to stage his edition, and inquiries have come from as far afield as Iceland and Brazil.</p>
        <p>Even apart from Mozart's contributions, there would be reasons to want to know about ''Der Stein.'' Schikaneder, who gave himself exclusive billing, was also the librettist for ''Die Zauberflote,'' which had its premiere at his theater in September 1791, with the impresario as the folksy bird catcher Papageno. In the same ensemble, Schack portrayed Tamino, the prince charged with the rescue of the kidnapped princess Pamina. Gerl played Sarastro, the benign sage who, for a while, must hide his intentions behind a mask of tyranny. Our context for Mozart's operas is mostly other Mozart operas, but in the case of ''Die Zauberflote,'' comparisons with his other masterpieces shed little light. On paper, at least, the links to the creative team and personnel of ''Der Stein,'' not to mention the hint in the title of similar subject matter, promise to be more revealing.</p>
        <p>And so they are, to a point. Like ''Die Zauberflote,'' ''Der Stein'' tells a tale of young lovers enmeshed against their wills in the power struggles of supposed immortals. Like ''Die Zauberflote,''  ''Der Stein'' features a second, comic couple as foil to the principal, ''heroic'' pair. In each work, the curtain rises on an exotic clime, where magic, black and white, runs rampant. Enchanted red herrings litter the ground. Strange prohibitions are in force. Allegiances dissolve as if by amnesia.</p>
        <p>Transformations occur like clockwork. Serviceable spirits offer refreshment to wanderers in the desert. On the evidence, the Wieden trapdoor was in fine working order; the earth is always hungry to swallow up the wicked or the unfortunate. The language of ''Der Stein'' and ''Die Zauberflote'' flows all too plainly from the same formulaic quill. Musical echoes between the operas are frequent and often astonishing. Both range unabashedly between the heroic strain and an earthy vernacular.</p>
        <p>No doubt about it: Schikaneder cooked up ''Der Stein'' and ''Die Zauberflote'' to cater to the same customers. Yet for all the identical ingredients, the banquets are not at all alike.</p>
        <p>''Der Stein'' begins with an Arcadian ritual in honor of the divine Astromonte, to whom virgins and youths of pure heart are to make sacrifice. Sadik, the ruler of the land, notes with alarm the absence of Nadir, his adopted son, and Nadine, his daughter. Shortly, they appear, accompanied by Sadik's forester Lubano and Lubano's helpmeet Lubanara, who have jumped the gun and consummated an unsanctified marriage. The celebrants flee in outrage.</p>
        <p>We instantly recognize Nadir and Nadine as this opera's Tamino and Pamina, Lubano and Lubanara as its Papageno and Papagena; and in fact, with one exception, the same singers took the corresponding parts in both operas. But we encounter them at a dreary juncture, as if the trials of ''Die Zauberflote'' were behind them, and happily ever after were already morphing into a disillusioned morning after.</p>
        <p>For Lubano and Lubanara, the honeymoon is definitely over. She craves sexual adventure; he is bored yet possessive, and locks her up. Nadine wins a chastity contest, as a result of which she is borne away by Astromonte, a sort of super-Sarastro (but a tenor, originally Schack). Nadir, broken-hearted, resolves to win her back and runs afoul of Astromonte's demonic enemy Eutifronte (a coloratura-bass Queen of the Night).</p>
        <p>Through Eutifronte's machinations Nadir runs Nadine through with an arrow instead. Lubano and Lubanara likewise fall into the evil one's clutches. Then all is set right when Nadir is revealed to be Astromonte junior, long supposed murdered by Eutifronte. And who does Eutifronte turn out to be but Astromonte's younger brother, driven past endurance at the loss of their father's prize possession (the almighty philosophers' stone of the title) and of the woman both brothers loved? Nadir marries Nadine, miraculously brought back to life, harmony descends on Arcadia once more, and all but the unreconciled villain rejoice.</p>
        <p>Silly people (and many bright ones) like to say that it is in the nature of a libretto to be foolish. The libretto of ''Der Stein'' gives such people plenty of ammunition, spinning out a shaggy-dog story that is superficially full of incident but in fact goes nowhere. It endorses the status quo, glorifying first and last the virtue of ''innocence'': the dull, unsustainable purity of the blank page. By contrast, the libretto of ''Die Zauberflote,'' often mocked, celebrates the triumph of a new order on the ruins of the old in action that is really very shapely and clear.</p>
        <p>The story of the later opera opens with the hero's thrilling plunge into adventure: enter Tamino with a bow but no arrows, pursued by a dragon. Hardly has he come to his senses when the Queen of the Night charges him with the perilous quest. The fortunes of Tamino's reluctant companion Papageno, and Papagena, his predestined mate, unfold in comic counterpoint. Most of the plot's logical inconsistencies, such as they are, arise from our gradually shifting perceptions of who is actually who. Along with Tamino, we live and learn.</p>
        <p>But not only does ''Die Zauberflote'' tell a better story; the action, with its magic flute and glockenspiel, is also custom-made for music. Only a year separates ''Die Zauberflote'' from ''Der Stein,'' and we may wonder: what made Schikaneder's handiwork in ''Die Zauberflote'' so much better? Was he making better use of a better source? Did he simply come to value convergence over diffusion? There is another possibility: that Mozart played script doctor. As we know from other, better-documented instances, his dramatic instincts were splendid, and he was not too shy to voice them.</p>
        <p>And the music? ''No one suspected the opera would be this good,'' Mr. Buch writes in an exchange of e-mails. ''I certainly did not.'' The influential English critic Rodney Milnes praises Schack's contributions, slams young Henneberg's and catches a scent of Mozart in passages that are not attributed. Mr. Buch counts Henneberg's pages among the best and says the distinguished Mozartean Julian Rushton shares his opinion.</p>
        <p>To my ear, Henneberg's work runs the gamut from dumb to electrifying. Schack's pieces include an aria for Nadir that broadly prefigures and seems actually to be quoted in Tamino's ''Dies Bildnis,'' written for Schack by Mozart.</p>
        <p>Also to Schack's credit are a chorus in a forbiddingly Masonic strain that Mozart picks up in ''Die Zauberflote''; an aria for Astromonte that clearly anticipates, in tenor range, the first aria of the Queen of the Night (so does the text); and a quarrel among four ladies that Mozart plainly had in mind when he wrote a squabble for his three. Gerl, who sang the dastardly but impotent Eutifronte, wrote for himself a roiling vengeance aria, and for Schack a coloratura showpiece that rockets up to a high D.</p>
        <p>The basso's revenge? For writing of this kind in ''Die Zauberflote,'' so florid and so freakishly high, we must once more look to the part of the Queen of the Night, written for Josepha Hofer, Mozart's sister-in-law, who at the time of ''Der Stein'' was on maternity leave.</p>
        <p>Schikaneder's incongruously cheerful lament for the desolate Nadine sounds like an outtake from ''The Beggar's Opera.'' I find scant charm in Mozart's two meowing duets, which cannot have engaged his attention. The cat has Lubanara's tongue, so to speak, but real cats say much more than this. A miniature duet for a soprano Genie and the distraught Nadir, on the other hand, is a sketch for a tragic show stopper.</p>
        <p>Has any opera made it into the core of the standard repertory on the strength of popular tunes alone? I would venture to say not. As Mozart knew, a successful opera is not simply a string of numbers but drama in music. The score as a whole must carry the action. To my mind, ''Der Stein'' scores abysmally on this criterion. ''Just wait until you see a fine production,'' Mr. Buch writes, never having seen one himself.</p>
        <p>''I suspect that if people were told that all of 'Stein' was the work of Mozart,'' he adds, ''they would develop reasons to like the putative weaknesses. 'Long and tedious' would become 'breadth and scope.'  'Cliche' would become 'mastery of convention.' '' But who said ''long and tedious''? Who said ''cliche''?</p>
        <p>From his study of the score and the semistaged modern performances to date, Mr. Buch characterizes the music of ''Der Stein'' as ''masterful and theatrically efficacious to a high degree.'' And perhaps it is the tip of an iceberg. ''I look at all kinds of forgotten supernatural operas and find many hidden jewels out there.''</p>
        <p>Next up: ''Der Wohltatige Derwisch, Oder Die Schellenkappe'' (''The Charitable Dervish, or The Cap of Bells''), unknown to The New Grove Dictionary of Opera. The industrious Schikaneder is once again the librettist. Who wrote the music is uncertain, but Mr. Buch has found documentary evidence pointing to the ''Stein'' team, with participation by Mozart here and there again a possibility. Originally produced six months after ''Der Stein'' and six months before ''Die Zauberflote,'' the opera receives its modern-day premiere by Mr. Pearlman and Boston Baroque next March, with a Telarc recording to follow.</p>
        <p>It irks Mr. Buch that the standard repertory accommodates (by his count) only four 18th-century operas, all by Mozart. As if there were a quota; impresarios propose, but the public disposes. ''There are a number of wonderful works by lesser-knowns that are neglected because they don't have a brand name,'' he writes. '' 'Stein' is getting its day because of the Mozart brand name.''</p>
        <p>The connection is tenuous, but you can fool some of the people some of the time. If the vogue of hidden jewels from Vienna's fairy-tale treasure chest is to continue, and it could be fun while it lasts, some other brand name will have to catch on. Might Schikaneder's do the trick?</p>
