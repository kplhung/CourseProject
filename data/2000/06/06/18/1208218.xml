        <p>THE setting: An outdoor equestrian arena, which in late afternoon sun doubles as an unusual performance space.</p>
        <p>Three horses and their riders and four dancers move to the unsettled five-beat rhythm of a Dave Brubeck piece that sounds from black speakers placed against a red barn near the ring.</p>
        <p>The performance, called Dancing with Horses, at the River Ridge Equestrian Center in Eastchester, was choreographed by JoAnna Mendl Shaw. She had choreographed ice skaters, in-line skaters and Swiss gymnasts; now she wanted to pair dancers with horses.</p>
        <p>In one piece, two dancers form a gate and swing their arms open, like a human tollbooth for the moving horse, which looked puzzled at first, then alert and interested. In another, the three horses and four dancers move around one another in sweeping, graceful patterns. They all were to perform at Garrett Mountain Stables in West Paterson, N.J., this weekend and on July 8 and 9 at the Orange County Arts Festival in Warwick, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shaw paused briefly to explain her goal: to integrate movement of horse with movement of dancers but not in the traditional prancing way of Lipizzaners or the gymnastic tumbling of vaulters.</p>
        <p>Around the ring, barn workers stole glances at the New York dancers, who moved about in rehearsal clothes and black workboots, weaving in and out of the three horses.</p>
        <p>The ring was tense because one of the three star-billed horses was withdrawn at the last moment. So in grand show-business tradition, the gray thoroughbred, already performing in several other numbers, stepped in and the show went on.</p>
        <p>Pausing to watch the production, another rider observed: ''Can you believe how the dancers can move so gracefully in all that ring dirt? I have enough trouble just walking in it.''</p>
