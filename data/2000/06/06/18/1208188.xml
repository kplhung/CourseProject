      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>MARRA'S, in Glen Cove, is a marvel. It offers chewy olive and tomato rolls and homemade sun-dried tomato pesto to new arrivals. There is a bottle of very good garlic- and rosemary-flavored virgin olive oil on every table and glasses of water come with lemon slices discretely perched on their rims. Yet, despite touches of a sort usually encountered at luxury restaurants, nothing on the menu costs more than $10.</p>
        <p>This tiny new storefront, at 1 School Street (516-609-3335), is owned by Mario Marra, who for the past few years was the executive chef at the far fancier DiMaggio's just down the road. Mr. Marra could easily and expertly prepare more complex dishes than those on the menu at this pasta-pizza-panini spot. But he provides food that propels Marra's well beyond the level of the Island's many modest garden-variety Italian outposts.</p>

        <p>MARRA'S, in Glen Cove, is a marvel. It offers chewy olive and tomato rolls and homemade sun-dried tomato pesto to new arrivals. There is a bottle of very good garlic- and rosemary-flavored virgin olive oil on every table and glasses of water come with lemon slices discretely perched on their rims. Yet, despite touches of a sort usually encountered at luxury restaurants, nothing on the menu costs more than $10.</p>
        <p>This tiny new storefront, at 1 School Street (516-609-3335), is owned by Mario Marra, who for the past few years was the executive chef at the far fancier DiMaggio's just down the road. Mr. Marra could easily and expertly prepare more complex dishes than those on the menu at this pasta-pizza-panini spot. But he provides food that propels Marra's well beyond the level of the Island's many modest garden-variety Italian outposts.</p>
        <p>There's another positive factor at work here: the loyalty, dedication and enthusiasm of the family-dominated staff. Mr. Marra's wife is the cashier, his mother-in-law is the hostess and one or two of the waitresses are also relatives. Their concern manifests itself in many ways. When a woman eating by herself apologized to the hostess for taking up a table, the warm, reassuring reply she received was, ''Don't be silly, I'm alone too, but I gotta eat.''</p>
        <p>Marra's is a high, narrow place with a loft that serves lunch and dinner, seven days a week (lunch can be eaten in an outside courtyard under umbrellas). It's cheery and upbeat with mulberry-trimmed amber walls, an open kitchen framed by a brightly tiled wraparound counter and a scattering of antique bottles, copper plates, seltzer bottles, flower sifters and coffee cans.</p>
        <p>Brick-oven pizzas ($5 to $10) sport razor-thin crusts and the freshest add-ons. The campagnola ($7 and $10) boasted sweet fennel-studded sausage and sprightly peppers.  Fried calamari is a staple on nearly every Italian menu, but just a handful of them offer it grilled as well.  Marra's version has six curled calamari served warm with a lemon pesto glaze atop a bed of greens ($7).</p>
        <p>Starters sampled were a terrific Caesar salad ($5) with crumbled croutons in a tangy, garlic vinaigrette dressing, laced with aged Parmesan cheese; a goat cheese and tomato salad ($7) resting on four pesto toast spokes that contained ripe tomato wedges coated with a seductive melted cheese, olive oil, Bermuda onion, red wine vinaigrette; and a homey pasta fagioli ($4), almost solid with tiny specks of tubettine pasta, red and white cannellini beans, tomatoes and pancetta.</p>
        <p>Pastas and panini are even better buys than appetizers. Big bowls of noodles cost as little as $6 and huge Italian sandwiches on rolls, paired with thatches of skinny, crisp, golden French fries, are in the $6 to $8 category.</p>
        <p>The five pastas we ordered were all cooked to an al dente ideal. Best was capellini d'angelo ($10), a shrimp and pasta combination of a sort that's often pallid. Here, its tender shrimp nubbins, fresh, sweet tomatoes, basil, parsley and a handful or two of garlic slivers make the dish sing with flavor. The penne rigate ($6), a toss of escarole, cannellini beans and garlic and oil, is perfect for diners who desire an earthy, peasanty, belly-warming dish.</p>
        <p>Don't expect the traditional squeezed-in-a-sandwich-press panini. Instead, you will be served warm rolls packed high with an array of first-class ingredients like grilled chicken, shrimp, sausage, zucchini, onions, portobello mushrooms, roasted peppers, fresh mozzarella, goat cheese, radicchio and prosciutto.</p>
        <p>Italian storefront spots don't usually make most of their own desserts.  Marra's does. For $3.75 patrons can cap off their dinners with an intense chocolate mousse cake, tiramisu that's so fluffy it's almost inhaleable or a dense, heavyweight Amaretto cheesecake.</p>
        <p>Marra's is a tiny Tuscan-gold treasure that serves a lot of everything, most of it remarkably good, at easy-to-swallow prices. Every town should have an any-day-of-the-week restaurant like this.</p>
