      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>When I was a freshman at Randolph-Macon Women's College in Lynchburg, Va., I had an English professor who was an avid birder. He described the mating dance of the woodcock just as Jonathan Rosen (May 21) did, and I was a convert. It was easy to find a fabulous array of birds in the Blue Ridge Mountains and the James River wetlands.</p>
        <p>I still get excited when a colorful warbler alights in my white lilac outside my kitchen window. My family worries that I'll wreck the car craning my neck to decide if the hawk I've spied is a red-tailed or a broad-wing. Rosen is so right: bird-watching takes over your senses. It's you and the birds.</p>
