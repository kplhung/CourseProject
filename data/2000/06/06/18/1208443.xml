        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was compelled to write after reading Jonathan Kozol's Soapbox essay, ''The Shame of the Nation'' (June 4). Over the last two years, I have worked as a teaching artist for New York University, Roundabout Theater Company and Theater for a New Audience. This has sent me into schools all over the city.</p>
        <p>The first school I visited was in the South Bronx. It was one of the more successful high schools, with young, ambitious teachers. The students were largely Hispanic.</p>
        <p>I had planned a project that involved historical research. The students would create plays based on characters from history, linking them to family issues of today. The teacher regretfully told me it would be an impossible task. She walked me down to the school library and unlocked the door. I could not believe my eyes. The shelves were empty. Some had been used to stack bundles of magazines waiting to be recycled. In the far corner were several computers piled on top of each other, that had been donated from a rich school in Manhattan. Perhaps the students could do research on the Internet? The overworked technician did not have time to set them up.</p>
        <p>The kids were bright and fun to work with, and the teacher was enthusiastic, talented and respected by the students. But I was limited in how far I could go, because of the lack of resources and support. How are these young people able to pursue their American dream without access to something as basic as reference books?</p>
