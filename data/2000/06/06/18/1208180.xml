        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>The free park concert series -- with its bring-your-own-seating requirements -- begins in a major way this week. Odetta, the folk artist, opens the Huntington Arts Council's Summer Arts Festival on Friday at 8:30 p.m. at Heckscher Park off Route 25A. The Coasters, with Carl Gardner, on Saturday and the Brave New World Klezmer Ensemble next Sunday complete the opening weekend (631) 271-8423. On Saturday, the New York Pops, conducted by Skitch Henderson and with Maureen McGovern as special guest, start the season at Brookhaven's Bald Hill Amphitheater and Cultural Center in Farmingville. The headliners take the stage at 7:30 p.m., following the Brookhaven Youth Orchestra at 6:30 p.m. (631) 732-3536.</p>
        <p>Father's Day</p>
        <p>Dads don't get the same attention that mothers receive, but there are a few nods today in the direction of Father's Day. For example, Chamber Players International does more than just close out its season. Its ''Musical Cuisine'' is devoted to ''Papa Bach,'' saluting fathers in general and that father in particular. Also marking Bach's 250th anniversary, the concert features Mark Peskanov, violinist, and Robert Wolinisky, harpsichordist, in a program that includes the A major Violin Concerto, the D minor Harpsichord Concerto and the Double Concerto for Two Violin Soloists, Harpsichord and Strings. The international champagne brunch is from noon to 2 p.m.; the music starts at 2 p.m. It all takes place at the Brookville Country Club on Chicken Valley Road in Glen Head.(877) 444-4488.</p>
        <p>In Setauket, the Three Village Historical Society holds a ''Father's Day Walking Tour of the Village Green'' at 2 p.m. The one-hour walk will touch upon the architecture, historical background and natural beauty of the area, which was the first settlement in Brookhaven and the center of town government until the end of the Revolutionary War. Fathers can indulge free; others will pay $2 for the program, which leaves from the Neighborhood House lawn on Main Street (631) 751-3730.</p>
        <p>Dionne Times Three</p>
        <p>Since she's traveling east to appear at the Westhampton Performing Arts Center, Dionne Warwick is making the most of her visit. On Friday, performing with the Duke Ellington Orchestra, conducted by Paul Mercer Ellington, Ms. Warwick will sing the ''Ellington Songbook'' twice at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. If negotiations work out, one of the world premiere performances will be taped for cable television. Then on Saturday, backed by her own 10-piece band, Ms. Warwick will recreate her greatest hits in a kind of ''Dionne Sings Dionne'' concert at 8:30 p.m. The center is on Main Street (631) 288-1500. Incidentally, if you miss Ms. Warwick this weekend, on July 30 she will be at the Westbury Music Fair (516) 334-0800.</p>
        <p>'Cool' Brady Boy</p>
        <p>For fans of ''The Brady Bunch'' television series the Patchogue Theater for the Performing Arts has something not to be missed. It's ''Growing Up Brady,'' Barry Williams's one-man show, described as a ''total Brady experience, an interactive multimedia presentation that includes, stories, videos, costumes, music and dance.'' Since Mr. Williams played Greg Brady, the so-called ''coolest'' Brady boy, his recollections, on Thursday at 8 p.m. at the theater on Main Street, should provide some behind-the-scenes insights (631) 286-1133.</p>
        <p>From the Camps</p>
        <p>Using the art, poetry and narrative created by the children held captive -- and mostly killed -- in the Terezin concentration camp, the Pushcart Players perform ''The Last, the Very Last . . . Butterfly'' at Guild Hall's John Drew Theater in East Hampton Friday through next Sunday. The production, emphasizing the poetry and narrative, is based on the book, ''I Never Saw Another Butterfly,'' which was derived from the works found after the war and donated to the Prague Jewish community. Of the 15,000 children imprisoned at Terezin and deported to Auschwitz, only 100 survived, none under the age of 14. The play will be performed at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday, with Rabbi David Gelfand of the Jewish Center of the Hamptons leading discussions on Saturday and Sunday (631) 324-4050.</p>
        <p>Wine Country Music</p>
        <p>The East End Arts Council has just what North Fork residents and visitors might order: ''Wine Country Concert Series 2000.'' From 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., the six Saturday concerts at vineyards throughout the area turn the cocktail hour into mellow wine tours with musical interludes. The series begins Saturday at the Jamesport Wineyards on Main Road with the Lew Picardi Swing Orchestra and then continues weekly on July 8. For $10 a ticket (children under 12, free) audiences have to bring their own seating and, at an extra price, the vineyards will provide the liquid refreshments by the glass or the bottle (631) 727-0900.</p>
        <p>Sited Sculpture</p>
        <p>Artists in Greenport do not create in a vacumn. At least, when they participate in ''Footfalls 2000'' they take their environments seriously, coming up with site-specific sculptures that are ''very related to the sites they select,'' said Brenda Miller, an organizer of this year's exhibition of works by 13 artists that will be situated throughout the village. So, since Susan Smith has chosen a local beach, nicknamed ''Glass Beach,'' her piece with an erosion theme, will be fashioned from native plants she has hardened on the roof of her Manhattan apartment building and snow fencing. Pete Jauquet, Ms. Miller said, will ''bring the New York City subway to Greenport'' in the area of the ferry landing and bus and train station, but how and with what, she doesn't know. The exhibition runs through Sept. 24 after an opening reception Saturday at 4 p.m. at the Maritime Museum on Bootleg Alley when catalogs describing what's where will be available (631) 477-1572.</p>
        <p>O'Hara and Music</p>
        <p>Frank O'Hara wasn't just a poet-curator who inspired artists; he also had impact on composers, and on Saturday in connection with its current exhibition, ''In Memory of My Feelings: Frank O'Hara and American Art,'' the Parrish Art Museum, Job's Lane in Southampton, holds a concert, ''Words Set to Music.'' Performed by Marianne Koerner, soprano; and Scott Murphee, baritone; and Alvin Novak, pianist, the program at 6:30 p.m. features O'Hara poems set by Ned Rorem, John Gruen and Christopher Berg; Virgil Thomson's and William Bolcolm's settings of poems by Kenneth Koch and Arnold Weinstein, respectively, and the never-before performed ''Undercover Lover,'' written by O'Hara and Weinstein to Mr. Gruen's music (631) 283-2118.</p>
        <p>Take a New 'Hedda'</p>
        <p>The Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor does something it has not done before -- stages a classic. Not any old classic, mind you; but Henrik Ibsen's masterpiece, ''Hedda Gabler.'' What's more, it will be a new version of the precedent-setting, turn-of-the-19th-century drama of a woman yearning to break free from a dull, bourgeois marriage; one by Jon Robin Baitz, the contemporary playwright who will leave the time frame intact while he fiddles with the rest. Produced in collaboration with the Williamstown Theater Festival, which gets the play after its run in Sag Harbor ends on July 9, and directed by Nicholas Martin, a veteran of the Williamstown festival, the drama's cast includes such noted actors as Kate Burton as Hedda, Harris Yulin as Judge Brack and Michael Emerson as George Tesman (631) 725-9500.</p>
        <p>Free Choices</p>
        <p>TODAY -- Chinese culture is celebrated in the ''Dragon Boat Festival'' that the Chinese Cultural Association of Great Neck holds at the High School South on Lakeville Road from 2 to 5 p.m. (516) 466-1248.</p>
        <p>TOMORROW -- Every other month, 50 Long Islanders -- male, female; from teenagers to septuagenarians -- gather to worship at the shrine of two silent film comedians. Members of the local chapter of ''The Sons of the Desert, the International Laurel and Hardy Appreciation Society'' watch a few of their idols' movies, discuss them thoroughly and then share refreshments. This time out, they meet in the Reception Center at the Old Bethpage Village Restoration on Round Swamp Road (516) 826-8374.</p>
        <p>SATURDAY -- Pony rides, face painting, music, tae kwon do and life-guarding demonstrations, and, yes, swimming will be on tap from noon to 4 p.m. at Meschutt Beach County Park in Hampton Bays during ''Family Fun Day'' (631) 852-8205.</p>
