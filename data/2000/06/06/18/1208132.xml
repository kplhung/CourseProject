        <p>Randy Cohen The Ethicist question-and-answer column on ethics of doctor not checking accident victims for alcohol and drugs to protect their health insurance coverage at possible risk to their health; also responds to classic moral dilemma presented to business students (M)</p>

        <p>I am a physician in a trauma center that does not check accident victims for alcohol and drugs. If a driver were intoxicated, insurance would not cover medical costs. However, not knowing blood- alcohol levels may have adverse medical consequences. Should we check even if it means added financial burdens, suboptimal care or exposure to criminal charges? -- Anonymous, New York</p>
        <p>A doctor is pledged to do what is in the patient's best interest medically. So check blood-alcohol levels, but do not disclose this information -- neither to cops nor insurance companies -- without the patient's consent. The A.M.A.'s confidentiality policy is meant to protect individual patients, not to promote public health, aid law enforcement or reduce insurance rates.</p>

        <p>A doctor is pledged to do what is in the patient's best interest medically. So check blood-alcohol levels, but do not disclose this information -- neither to cops nor insurance companies -- without the patient's consent. The A.M.A.'s confidentiality policy is meant to protect individual patients, not to promote public health, aid law enforcement or reduce insurance rates.</p>
        <p>Of course, varying state statutes can create conflicts between what is legal and what is ethical, putting the doctor in an awkward position. Fortunately, even aggressive disclosure laws often allow some discretion. Some doctors, for example, regard a medical chart as a guideline for continued care: anything not directly pertinent need not be recorded. From this perspective, a knowledge of blood-alcohol level that is vital for immediate treatment may not be germane to future care and can be omitted.</p>
        <p>You should discuss these issues with your colleagues when reviewing E.R. policy, rather than leave them to the ad hoc decision of an individual doctor under pressure. And do this not when the patient is on the table but at the end of the working day. That is also the time to contact your representatives and rally your colleagues against laws that hinder patient care; this, too, is a doctor's ethical obligation.</p>
        <p>I teach business ethics for a local university. I wonder how you would respond to this classic moral dilemma: John walks into a village and finds Mary holding 15 people hostage. Mary says that she will kill them all unless John takes a gun and kills one of the hostages. All of the hostages are innocent people. What should John do? -- J. De Pauw, Arlington, Va.</p>
