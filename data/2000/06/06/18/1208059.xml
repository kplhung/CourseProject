        <p>Flags of</p>
        <p>Our Fathers</p>
        <p>By James Bradley</p>
        <p>with Ron Powers.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 376 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Bantam Books. $24.95.</p>
        <p>FOR the Japanese high command in 1944, more than two years of war had brought no lasting victories after the first one at Pearl Harbor. The Allied forces were moving steadily northward along the island chain leading to the Japanese home islands themselves; the generals and admirals now knew there would be no final victory, but they hoped that if each battle were made more costly to the enemy, the United States would ultimately agree to a negotiated settlement.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the American high command was concentrating its planning on those home islands, correctly anticipating that bases between bombing targets in Japan and the American airfields on Saipan and Tinian would be vital as refueling and repair stops. The Japanese, as John Bradley and Ron Powers relate in ''Flag of Our Fathers,'' decided to make one of these islands as impregnable as possible. This was Iwo Jima, a tiny speck 600 miles south of Tokyo, whose central features were two airstrips, a narrow two miles of beaches and Mount Suribachi, an extinct volcano whose core and surface became a rabbit warren for munitions storage, artillery and mortar points, hospitals and living accommodations for 22,000 defenders.</p>
        <p>Iwo Jima was also the island the Navy had targeted for capture by a force of 100,000 men, including 70,000 Marine assault troops who had been training and rehearsing this landing for a year. The marines who landed on Feb. 19, 1945, were typical of World War II servicemen -- children of the Depression from Wisconsin or Kentucky, a New Hampshire mill town, the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, an Indian reservation. Some had already seen combat, some had not, but all were headed for the same bloody destiny.</p>
        <p>The 36-day battle for Iwo Jima has seldom been chronicled in such detail. Bradley and Powers describe how a few of the men landed from the sea and fought their way through black lava sand that had a talcum-powder consistency, resistant to retreat or advance, cover or concealment. In the battle, 26,000 of the 80,000 marines who went ashore were killed or wounded. Of the 84 Medals of Honor the Marines won in World War II, one-third were awarded for the Iwo Jima action. All of the 22,000 Japanese soldiers perished.</p>
        <p>After two days on the beach, under constant and withering fire, a band of marines scrabbled up the smoking slopes of Suribachi to raise the flag for their comrades and history to see. One of them was John Bradley, winner of the Navy Cross and father of James Bradley. He seldom mentioned the war, insisting undramatically that Iwo Jima had no heroes but the dead. But his son was sufficiently interested to try to find out what happened to the five other men in the famous picture.</p>
        <p>Three of the six did not leave Iwo Jima alive. John Bradley died in 1994. Of his surviving companions, Rene Gagnon returned to New Hampshire and died bitter and disappointed that his country never gave him the recognition he thought he deserved. Ira Hayes, a Pima Indian, returned to Arizona and a life of drinking, drifting and working at odd jobs until he died at 32 after a drunken bar brawl 10 years after the flag-raising.</p>
        <p>Bradley and Powers, the former television critic at The Chicago Sun-Times, describe the yearlong training and the days of fighting, with graphic descriptions of beaches jammed with the dead, the wounded and those about to be either or both, and give a detailed account of the flag-raisings (there were two, the first flag a small banner and a second, more famous large one). When they depart from describing combat, however, Bradley and Powers are less successful. Examining the survivors' sad postwar lives, they draw an unpersuasive conclusion when they call Hayes and Gagnon casualties of war. This does no service to most of the 16 million other Americans who put on uniforms, went to war, did their jobs and generally went home to resume ordinary lives. However, the six did fight well in an action where, as the Pacific commander, Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, said, ''Uncommon valor was a common virtue.''</p>
