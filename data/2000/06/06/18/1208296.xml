        <p>Carl Safina, a marine biologist from Islip, and Laura Otis, a Hofstra University English professor who explores connections between different ways of learning, were among 25 recipients of this year's MacArthur Fellowships.</p>
        <p>The no-strings, five-year $500,000 grants have been presented since 1981 to those who are ''extraordinarily creative in their work'' and can use the money to contribute more, said Daniel Socolow, director of the program.</p>
        <p>Dr. Otis, 38, who grew up in Stony Brook, said she would like to use the grant to move close to a ''top-notch research library so that I can wander through the stacks and discover books I and the library didn't know were there.''</p>
        <p>She plans to take a leave from Hofstra in the fall to do research in Berlin on how scientists get their ideas. ''Do they come up with the ideas themselves, or from interactions with others, or from political pressures?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>Dr. Safina, 45, is vice president for marine conservation at the National Audubon Society Living Oceans Program in Islip. Mr. Socolow said the foundation viewed him as ''probably the best friend fish ever had, and we are impressed by him.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Safina, who grew up in Oyster Bay and Syosset, plans to write about the ''the incredible mosaic of habitats and wildlife in the oceans.''</p>
        <p>''The ocean is not just blank blue space but rather the habitat for amazing wildlife, and we have to take care how we use it,'' he continued. ''If we want to keep having the goods and services it provides, we have to treat it more carefully in terms of fishing and dumping.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Safina plans to use the money to hire a management team to run the Audubon Society program in Islip.</p>
