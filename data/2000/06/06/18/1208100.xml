        <p>Q The lease of the rent-stabilized apartment that I reside in is in my name and my spouse's name. We are now separated and I am planning to have a roommate to share the rent. Am I jeopardizing my lease? Also, where can I find more information about the rules and regulations of rent stabilization? . . . Terry Mune, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A Thomas P. Higgins, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said that taking in a roommate should not jeopardize the letter writer's lease under the described circumstances.</p>
        <p>Mr. Higgins explained that Section 235-f of the state's Real Property Law -- also known as the Roommate Law -- allows a tenant to take in an additional occupant, and any dependent children of the additional occupant, without violating the terms of the tenant's rent-stabilized lease.</p>
        <p>The law also provides that when a lease has been entered into by two or more tenants -- as in the letter writer's case -- the total number of tenants and occupants, excluding dependent children of the occupant, cannot exceed the number of tenants specified in the lease. Accordingly, Mr. Higgins said, as long as the spouse lives elsewhere, the letter writer can certainly have a roommate.</p>
        <p>If the spouse moves back into the apartment, however, the roommate's continued occupancy could constitute a violation of the lease that would not be protected by the roommate law.</p>
        <p>Mr. Higgins said that information about the rules and regulations of rent stabilization can be obtained by contacting the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal's rent hotline at (718) 739-6400 or by visiting the division's Web site at www.dhcr.ny.states.us.</p>
        <p>Tax Rebate for A Co-op Owner</p>
        <p>Q Until last July 29, I was the owner of a co-op apartment in Manhattan. As a tenant-shareholder, I paid my proportionate share of the building's real estate taxes as part of my monthly maintenance fees. Recently, when I heard that the city was giving tax rebates to co-op and condominium owners for the tax year that ran from July 1, 1998, to June 30, 1999, I asked the managing agent how I would go about getting my rebate since I owned the apartment -- and paid taxes on it -- during that time period. He told me that since the rebate was distributed as a reduction in maintenance charges, it was credited to the current owner and there was nothing he could do about it. Is this correct? . . . Rosemary Rogers, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A Douglas F. Wasser, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that since co-op and condo tax rebates are paid to the co-op corporation, the co-op is permitted to distribute the rebates to its shareholders as a reduction in monthly maintenance charges. Accordingly, Mr. Wasser said, it is incumbent on those who buy or sell apartments to address what will be done with rebates that will be credited after the date of the closing.</p>
        <p>Most contracts, he said, provide that all obligations between the buyer and seller terminate at the time of closing. In other words, Mr. Wasser said, financial apportionments that are not settled at closing -- including those that may occur in the future -- are generally considered waived.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, he said, the letter writer could recover the rebate from the current owner only if there was a provision in the contract of sale indicating that the rebate would be apportioned -- or turned over to the seller in its entirety -- when it was received by the new owner.</p>
