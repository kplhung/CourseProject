        <p>PERHAPS the most unconventional theatrical experience currently being offered in New York is the American premiere of ''The Designated Mourner'' by Wallace Shawn, with the author, Larry Pine and Deborah Eisenberg in the cast directed by Andre Gregory.</p>
        <p>This three-character play, a cross between a political drama and a comedy of manners, concerns the fading of a tiny but vibrant community -- a cadre of artists and intellectuals snuffed out by the totalitarian government of their unnamed country.</p>
        <p>Appropriately, the production's site is a one-time gentlemen's club south of Wall Street in the Financial District, dilapidated but plush, that still bears the marks of its heyday during the First World War, when it was frequented by the city's most distinguished financiers.</p>
        <p>The audience climbs to the fourth level, passing the dismantled bar and a row of forlorn deer heads on the floor. Mr. Gregory and Mr. Shawn, in the role of the evening's hosts, stand at the door to the performing space, a sort of lounge with peeling paint and overstuffed chairs on risers. The set, designed by Eugene Lee and N. Joseph Detullio, is buried under sheets that Mr. Pine, as a representative of the play's vanished intelligentsia, slowly removes.</p>
        <p>At intermission -- after a snack -- the audience is led up two more flights into a much more constricted area, a former squash court. Here, the hard wooden chairs and streaked lime-green walls, the sparse setting and ominous closed door (which, unlike the doors to most theaters, is in full view of the spectators), suggest both the incarceration of the characters and the shrinking of their world.</p>
        <p>In a recent conversation in his Greenwich Village apartment, Mr. Gregory and his cast talked about the production. ''What happens generally when you go to the theater,'' Mr. Gregory said, ''is that you're given a program, you sit down in the kind of seat you've seen for years, you wait for the curtain to rise, and you fall into a habitual stance that doesn't allow you to receive the play in a different way. Here, you're thrown off balance. It allows you to be more open to whatever is to come.''</p>
        <p>The last production Mr. Gregory directed in New York, Chekhov's ''Uncle Vanya,'' took place in the magnificent ruins of Ziegfeld's New Amsterdam Theater on West 42nd Street in the early 1990's, before it was refurbished for ''The Lion King.''</p>
        <p>''Uncle Vanya'' was performed only for invited audiences until Mr. Gregory asked Louis Malle, who had directed Mr. Gregory and Mr. Shawn in the 1981 movie ''My Dinner With Andre,'' to put it on film in 1994. It became ''Vanya on 42nd Street,'' and is generally recognized as one of the finest interpretations of Chekhov in this era.</p>
        <p>''The Designated Mourner'' is accessible to the ticket-buying public, but it opened quietly, without advertising, for a 10-week run (through July 15) at 21 South William Street. Yet because of provocative reviews, the fact that audiences are limited to 30 people, and the considerable following of the cast and director, it sold out the day tickets went on sale.</p>
        <p>John Lahr, the chief theater critic of The New Yorker, declared it one of the signal theatrical experiences of the last 10 years. Bruce Weber, writing in The New York Times, said: ''Overall, it means to be the kind of art -- difficult, unsettling and out of the mainstream, but with an embracing heart -- that the play itself declares endangered.''  ''The Designated Mourner,'' Mr. Weber said, ''is so theatrically indulgent that it dares you to find it pretentious, or maybe just precious. It is both, actually, but to provocative and haunting effect.''</p>
        <p>Limiting the number of observers is a tendency of Mr. Gregory's; ''Uncle Vanya,'' too, was performed before pared-down audiences. That is because, the director said, he and his actors work to achieve a cinematic intimacy in performance to approximate acting in close-up.</p>
        <p>Moreover, he added, ''the intimacy doesn't allow the audience a comfortable distance,'' which is fitting for a play that, according to its author, is a study in ''cowardice, courage, collaboration and resistance.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gregory and the cast greet those who have been watching when the show is over, but at intermission the director keeps his distance because he doesn't want to ''intrude on the audience's space.'' Still, he sits in the house every night, enjoying the performance and taking the temperature of the audience, which, though it invariably includes two or three friends and colleagues, seems to be unified only by the fact that it has assembled to see the play. ''I've never seen such a varied response,'' Mr. Gregory said. ''Some nights people laugh as at a Neil Simon comedy; other nights they sit in a sort of horrified silence.''</p>
        <p>It is well known to any fan of the affectionate and garrulous ''My Dinner With Andre,'' which Mr. Shawn wrote in tribute to their friendship, that Mr. Gregory came out of the avant-garde American theater of the 1960's and that his sensibility has been strongly influenced by European theatrical movements. His family was European and he arrived in the United States as a young boy. In 1958 he spent a year with the Berliner Ensemble in East Germany, Bertolt Brecht's company, in  ''one of the great formative experiences of my life,'' as Mr. Gregory put it. In the 1970's he worked with the Polish director and innovator Jerzy Grotowski, whose book ''Towards a Poor Theater'' had helped to shape the theater of the previous decade in this country.</p>
        <p>THE DESIGNATED MOURNER'' is dedicated to Grotowski, who died in January. Though it may not be precisely ''poor theater,'' its $400,000 price tag is certainly modest by New York standards. (The nonprofit production has been financed by Celeste Bartos and Scott Rudin, a co-producer with Mr. Shawn and Mr. Gregory.) And the spare, limpid staging, which throws the focus on the actors, is the legacy of Grotowski. It works to illuminate the dense, opaque text and make it resonate, like a series of mirrors tilted at odd angles on this fragile, disappearing world.</p>
        <p>There is a decided European quality to almost every part of Mr. Gregory's process. For example, he works with an unofficial stock company, longtime collaborators who are also close friends. Except for Jennifer Tipton, the lighting designer, all of the principals involved in ''The Designated Mourner'' have known one another for more than a quarter of a century.</p>
        <p>Larry Pine (who played Astrov, the disaffected doctor, in ''Vanya on 42nd Street'') met Mr. Gregory at New York University in 1967, when the student company Mr. Pine was involved with invited Mr. Gregory to conduct a workshop; a handful wound up working on Mr. Gregory's celebrated dramatization of ''Alice in Wonderland.'' In the program for ''The Designated Mourner,'' Mr. Pine is listed as ''sous-chef,'' the director's way of acknowledging him as an informal assistant director. He credited Mr. Pine with some of the best ideas in the play, like the use of a bed as the centerpiece of the first act, a choice that evokes the lush, indulgent quality of the characters' lives.</p>
        <p>The company rehearsed in Mr. Gregory's apartment, and once Mr. Pine suggested they try playing Act I in the bedroom, Mr. Gregory said, ''We basically had the play.'' Mr. Pine portrays Howard, a poet-essayist who reigns over this group. In the first act he goes to prison and shortly afterward drops out of the script; later, the audience learns of his execution. But though Howard has no lines in the second act, Mr. Pine sits at the back of the performing area, gray and silent, a ghost overseeing the narrative.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shawn's partnership with Mr. Gregory began in 1972, when Mr. Gregory enlisted him to adapt ''Peer Gynt'' for a new production. When the two men concluded that Ibsen's epic could not be abridged and abandoned the project, Mr. Shawn recalled, ''I boldly volunteered to write an original play for the company. It was a marvelous opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gregory opened ''Our Late Night'' three years later; it was the first of Mr. Shawn's plays to be performed. Mr. Shawn was the Vanya of ''Vanya on 42nd Street,'' and in ''The Designated Mourner'' he portrays Jack, the sardonic narrator who takes on the task of memorializing Howard's world (he is its ''designated mourner''), which he divorced himself from when he walked out on his marriage to Howard's daughter, Judy.</p>
        <p>It is a marathon role; Mike Nichols, who played it in the world premiere at the Royal National Theater in London in 1996, depended on a digital crib sheet embedded in the table he sat behind, but Mr. Shawn, the author, requires no prompter.</p>
        <p>Judy is played by the fiction writer Deborah Eisenberg, who has lived with Mr. Shawn for many years. (She is the ''Debbie'' he refers to repeatedly in ''My Dinner With Andre.'')</p>
        <p>Besides the careful, offbeat crafting of the environment and the ensemble ethic, the element that most clearly marks Mr. Gregory's work is the length of the rehearsal process. ''Uncle Vanya'' rehearsed on and off for five and a half years; ''The Designated Mourner,'' for about nine months over a period of three years (''And the time outside the nine months, you're still rehearsing, even though you're not in the same room,'' Ms. Eisenberg said).</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Mr. Gregory, Mr. Shawn and Mr. Pine began making inroads on a production of ''The Master Builder'' by Ibsen that also includes Julie Hagerty and Brooke Smith, who was in ''Uncle Vanya.'' This attenuated rehearsal process would not seem bizarre to a French repertory company like Ariane Mnouchkine's Theatre du Soleil, but in the professional American theater, where a show is put up, typically, in six weeks, it is practically unheard of. Only a few scattered companies attempt it; one is the Wooster Group in New York, which took a year to assemble the 1999 ''House/Lights'' and even longer for an earlier work, ''Saint Anthony.''</p>
        <p>''This long, long time allows you to layer things up,'' Ms. Eisenberg said, ''so that you have a psychological history as the character, like that of a real person.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pine added: ''When you're working on something as intensely as you work on a role in a play, you think very hard, very convolutedly and very intensely about why and how you're doing something. And then over a long period of time you feel you've lived a full lifetime through the concentration you've put into that character. I've thought more about Howard, probably,'' he said, laughing, ''than I've thought about myself.''</p>
        <p>REHEARSING in this luxurious way permits what Ms. Eisenberg calls an elasticity in the work: ''Everything keeps changing shape.''</p>
        <p>For Elizabeth LeCompte, the director of the Wooster Group, a lengthy rehearsal period allows the material to emerge organically. ''I try not to know anything about what a piece is about before we're in the space rehearsing,'' she said. ''You know you have an inkling of something there that you want and you have to stick with it a little longer time before you find it.''</p>
        <p>In Mr. Gregory's work and that of his trio of actors, the extended rehearsal period blends with the notion of a continuing company to create a sense of something living on the stage, something that slips beyond the usual parameters of an evening's entertainment.</p>
        <p>''When you work this long,'' Mr. Gregory said, ''there's always the secret history of the company that is a subtext -- all we've been through together. The audience senses that subtext, which is our lives together.''</p>
        <p>The leading actress of the Wooster Group, Kate Valk, echoed this idea: ''What we do onstage is an extension of the reality of our lives -- all the characters, all the stories.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gregory's direction has a strong American component, however: he insists on naturalistic acting. ''The Designated Mourner'' is a highly stylized piece, and its structure -- Judy's presentation of historical events is a counterpoint to Jack's satirical take on this now-extinct community -- might be baffling without the careful, moment-to-moment layering of the performances, which, in Mr. Shawn's words, ''puts the play in the present tense.''</p>
        <p>In the 1997 film of the play, a faithful transcription of the National Theater version directed by David Hare, Mr. Nichols's character is the only one who feels recognizably human, so Jack's point of view naturally takes over. Mr. Gregory's actors treat their roles as if they were performing Chekhov, and the result is an unresolvable conflict of two attitudes -- Howard and Judy's highbrow liberalism and Jack's resolutely lowbrow cynicism.</p>
        <p>Members of the audience could find themselves constantly shifting, quarreling with their own first impressions of the characters. And the two plots, the political story and the marriage story, grow inextricable (as the war and the disintegrating marriage do in Ingmar Bergman's great 1968 apocalypse film ''Shame''), so that one begins to see them as metaphors for each other.</p>
        <p>''Like any moment of life,'' Mr. Shawn said, ''it's not any one thing. It's more amorphous and intangible and mysterious.''</p>
