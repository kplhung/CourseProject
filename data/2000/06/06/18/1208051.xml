        <p>BEE SEASON</p>
        <p>By Myla Goldberg.</p>
        <p>275 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Doubleday. $22.95.</p>
        <p>In J. D. Salinger's ''Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters,'' Seymour Glass offers the following definition of sentimentality: giving ''to a thing more tenderness than God gives to it.'' As definitions go, Seymour's is superbly strict, particularly when applied to fiction writers. As soon as a novelist begs you to love one of his characters, the spell is broken and freely given affection becomes an impossibility. It's time to scan for the exit signs.</p>
        <p>Myla Goldberg's first novel, ''Bee Season,'' is a dispassionate, fervidly intelligent book -- she explores class, linguistics and religious extremism with the confidence of a born essayist -- that comes by its emotion honestly. By the time she's finished building up, and then pulling apart, the Jewish family at the center of this story, you're likely to feel as devastated as its members all do. ''Bee Season'' reads like a spiky, artfully twisted Allegra Goodman novel -- it's ''Kaaterskill Falls'' meets ''American Beauty.''</p>
        <p>Despite its title, Goldberg's novel is not, thank God, yet another uplifting book (or movie) about bee keeping -- about sticking both paws into the honey pot of life. Instead, it's largely about an ordinary fifth-grade girl, Eliza Naumann, whose life is transformed when she unexpectedly wins her school's annual spelling bee. We're as shocked at her victory as she is. Although she's the daughter of ardent intellectuals, Eliza has never displayed a shred of academic ability. She's among those sad-sack</p>
        <p>C students who ''never get picked for Student of the Week'' and ''never get chased by boys at recess.'' While other kids are singled out for gifted-and-talented programs, Eliza is shuffled off into classrooms where the walls are covered with posters of kittens dangling from ropes above slogans like ''Hang in there'' and ''If at first you don't succeed. . . .'' Even her mother considers her ''a gosling born into a family of ducks.''</p>
        <p>Thus when Eliza is forced to compete in her first spelling bee, she is certain that this event, like so many others, exists only to ''confirm, display or amplify her mediocrity.'' Yet when the words start coming, something clicks inside her; she realizes she can not only spell the words directed at her but, as if by magic, everyone else's words as well. She wins the school's contest, and then a few district and regional ones, before heading to Washington for the national bee. When her father, a liberal cantor, learns of her first victory, he's so surprised that he glances at her ''as if she has suddenly borne a delicious fruit from her navel.'' Her brother, stripped almost overnight of his status as the family's golden child, gazes at her as if she were ''a formerly passive dog who has killed its first small animal.''</p>
        <p>Goldberg writes short, fresh, exacting sentences, and she is terrific on Eliza's sudden obsession with language, one that flourishes despite the girl's realization that being an ace speller isn't exactly a marketable intellectual ability. (''Spelling, after all, is a skill made redundant by the dictionary.'') Here is Goldman, for example, on Eliza's thoughts while flipping through a dictionary: ''Consonants are the camels of language, proudly carrying their lingual loads. Vowels, however, are a different species, the fish that flash and glisten in the watery depths. . . . Before the bee, Eliza had been a consonant, slow and unsurprising. With her bee success, she has entered vowelhood. Eliza begins to look at life in alphabetical terms. School is consonantal in its unchanging schedule. God, full of possibilities, is a vowel. Death: the ultimate consonant.''</p>
        <p>''Bee Season'' has something else going for it, something you didn't realize you'd been missing in recent fiction: a bit of actual suspense. As Eliza's victories mount, Goldberg carefully ratchets up the narrative tension. Even better, the author has done her homework. The writing about the insular world of spelling bees -- Goldberg clearly views these contests as geek versions of JonBenet Ramsey's kitschy beauty pageants -- has the clarity of fine journalism. We see both the fussy stage parents and the ''Comfort Counselors,'' who hover at the edge of the stage ''like benevolent vultures,'' ready to tend to a loser's hurt feelings. You don't blame Eliza for wanting to steer clear of them: ''Nothing amplifies failure,'' she observes, ''like the hug of a stranger.''</p>
        <p>Eliza's story alone has enough depth and resonance to carry a full-length novel, yet she is allowed to secure only a quarter of our attention here; Goldberg gives the girl's mother, father and brother equal time. In lesser hands, this kind of relentless cutting back and forth between characters and perspectives can give you a migraine. (It's like sitting center court at a doubles match.) Yet here the splicing rarely feels forced; the stories clarify and intensify one another as they push forward. The effect is that of watching a writer pull the lever on a slot machine and -- bang, bang, bang, bang -- seeing four cherries (and one outsize payoff) click into view.</p>
        <p>At first glance, the Naumann family appears to be merely screwed up in all the usual ways: the distracted father, Saul, spends most of his time in his study, researching forms of Jewish mysticism and worrying about the transcendence he'll never achieve; the mother, Miriam, is a lawyer who works long hours and begins to get off on the thrill of shoplifting minor objects; Eliza's brother, Aaron, is a dweeby high school student for whom puberty has yet to arrive -- he is mercilessly bullied by other kids. Goldman climbs effortlessly in and out of their heads. Miriam, for example, is so uncomfortable with her children that when one of them asks her about the boyfriends she'd had before marriage, she blushes. ''She wishes there were a book on the subject, slim as it would be, a 'Mother's Dating Life' she could substitute for conversation in the tidy manner of 'Where Do Babies Come From?' ''</p>
        <p>As ''Bee Season'' progresses, each of the Naumanns comes spinning apart, in ways that are so idiosyncratic and unexpected that it would be bad form to give too much away here. Suffice it to say that Saul's pursuit of the Jewish mystics seems to infect the rest of the family; they hunger for their own means of transcendence. As Saul introduces Eliza to the teachings of ancient Jewish scholars -- he considers the girl a ''mystical prodigy'' and believes that her gifts may open a direct channel to God -- Miriam and Aaron drift off into strange orbits of their own. Miriam's preoccupation with shoplifting becomes almost hallucinogenic in its intensity; Aaron, formerly his father's assistant at the synagogue, becomes infatuated with Eastern religion and, to Saul's horror, grows enamored of a group of Hare Krishnas. (The group's rituals seem at first ''like something Aaron might see on PBS, narrated by a modulated voice with a British accent''; by the book's end, he appears to be fully committed to them.) Chapter by chapter, ''Bee Season'' becomes a subtle and sober-minded meditation on the allure, and the danger, of seeking extreme religious experiences -- about trying to stand too close to the sun that is God. You climb up the stem of this novel as if it were a psychedelic flower; at the top there's a flash of strange radiance, followed by a sense of the character's powerfully felt defeat.</p>
        <p>''Bee Season'' is so smart, and frequently so charming, that you wait for Goldberg to begin making mistakes. She makes some big ones. For one thing, some of the late revelations here feel forced and implausible, even for a novel about extreme experiences. More important, ''Bee Season'' begins to feel overdetermined. Goldberg is the kind of writer who nails down her sentences (each one feels pinned securely to the page), and her characters can seem nailed down as well. As absorbing as each of their stories can be, you get the sense that there are few equations in this novel that weren't plotted on graph paper before Goldberg began writing.</p>
        <p>For a novel that's partly about transcendence, however, ''Bee Season'' keeps its feet planted in the earth. Goldberg's squabbling characters have many of the qualities that Nathan Zuckerman, in Philip Roth's ''Anatomy Lesson,'' called ''the very mark of the intellectual Jews'' -- the disputatious stance, the aggressively marginal sensibility, the disavowal of community ties, the taste for scrutinizing a social event as though it were a dream or a work of art.'' ''Bee Season'' flickers past like a dream, and it is artful indeed.</p>
