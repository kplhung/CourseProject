        <p>Bosie</p>
        <p>A Biography of Lord Alfred Douglas.</p>
        <p>By Douglas Murray.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 374 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Talk Miramax Books/Hyperion. $27.50.</p>
        <p>''THE leprous spawn of scattered Israel / Spreads its contagion in your English blood.'' Such lines as this did not prevent Lord Alfred Douglas from being regarded by some of his contemporaries as the greatest sonneteer since Shakespeare. Today he is better known as the beautiful, spoiled young man who, after failing to appear as a witness at the trial of his lover, Oscar Wilde, went on to become a passionate convert to Roman Catholicism and spend years vilifying Wilde's work and character while denying that he himself had ever been a homosexual.</p>
        <p>Lord Alfred has been in disgrace since his death in 1945. If Douglas Murray's fine and thoughtful biography, ''Bosie,'' contains no account of his subject's posthumous reputation, the reason is that it has scarcely existed, except in books about Wilde. Richard Ellmann, for example, placed his trust in the accuracy of ''De Profundis,'' the long and bitter letter that was written for Douglas when Wilde was serving his prison sentence. Yet despite Wilde's understandable feelings of hurt and betrayal, the fact remains that after leaving prison he quickly sought Douglas out and the two men resumed their life together.</p>
        <p>The biographer should not take precedence over the subject, but this is an exceptional case. Douglas Murray was 14 when he began work on ''Bosie.'' He is now 20 and an undergraduate at Oxford. His achievement is quite remarkable. He has found much new material. He has read everything that is relevant. He has played fair. He reminds us that while Douglas could produce lines as ugly as those that open this review, he could also produce the unforgettable: ''To clutch Life's hair, and thrust one naked phrase / Like a lean knife between the ribs of Time.'' Pulling no punches about Lord Alfred's many flaws, Murray compels us to recognize his qualities. This is a shrewd, generous and wise biography. Its stories and its cast of characters make it irresistible -- although not because of their charm.</p>
        <p>Douglas owed his beauty to his mother and his horrible temper and arrogance to his father. Indeed, Murray presents convincing evidence of a hereditary streak of insanity in Douglas's family, which emerged in the form of manic depression in his uncle, uncontrollable violence in his father and schizophrenia in his son, Raymond. Lord Alfred himself frequently behaved with a viciousness and staggering lack of judgment that suggest he had a fair share of these bad genes. His mother did him no favors by indulging her beloved Bosie's every whim.</p>
        <p>Douglas was 19 and finishing his first year at Oxford when he came across ''The Picture of Dorian Gray,'' the story of a man whose radiant beauty and untarnished youthfulness suggest an innocence long lost. Fascinated, he read it over and over. The following year he had his first meeting with the novel's author. In Ellmann's harsh view, Douglas was a good-looking boy who was wholly devoid of talent. Having set out to capture a genius, he led Wilde to share his own depraved attitude and contributed nothing to Wilde's literary life but interruptions.</p>
        <p>Murray offers a different and more convincing picture. Douglas had already shown his skill as a poet at Winchester. At Oxford, he was editing a literary magazine and writing sonnets that were good enough, when combined with his dazzling looks, to bewitch the older man. True, Wilde overrated him (and showed it when he invited Douglas to translate ''Salome'' from French into English), but the relationship as Murray depicts it is more persuasive than Ellmann's hostile and defensive reading. Wilde, as Murray points out, may have been famous by 1891, when he and Douglas met, but he was also middle-aged and physically unappealing to a young man who reveled in beauty. Many years later, Douglas described a relationship of endless jokes and repartee (''There were whole days we laughed our way through'') and, on Wilde's side, endless kindness and tolerance. The saddest thing to him about ''De Profundis'' was that it recalled only the quarrels and misunderstandings.</p>
        <p>Douglas had inherited the family temper. Murray does not dispute that Lord Alfred was largely responsible for provoking Wilde's disastrous decision to sue his father, the Marquess of Queensberry, for libel after he delivered his infamous card inscribed ''For Oscar Wilde -- posing as a sodomite.'' Given the marquess's suspicions, ''posing'' seems quite a modest accusation. It was enough. One case followed another, and Wilde went to prison, largely as a result of the government's need to pacify the British public in one of its periodic fits of morality. It didn't help that Douglas's oldest brother had just shot himself on the eve of his engagement because, it was widely rumored, of an affair he had been having with Lord Rosebery, a prominent politician. Douglas's father had already threatened to horsewhip Lord Rosebery; his obsessive hounding of Wilde is made even more explicable by the fact that his second wife was suing for an annulment on the grounds, among others, of nonconsummation.</p>
        <p>In Murray's telling, Douglas comes shiningly out of the post-prison period as Wilde's loyal friend and financial supporter. But from then on, ''Bosie'' takes its subject on a dark journey to the brink of madness. Having acquired religion and a wife, Douglas turned his back on the past. Laying about him with all the fervor of the converted, he denounced Wilde (who had died in 1900) as a corrupter of youth and talentless to boot. Endeavors to clear Wilde's name were ferociously opposed: ''You may be quite sure you will never be asked to the house again,'' Douglas wrote to Wilde's primary defender, Robert Ross, after physically attacking him at a dinner party. His main charge against Ross whenever he had the chance to shout it from a witness stand -- there were many opportunities -- was that he, like Wilde, was a sodomite. Douglas had, in some eerie way, become his father's voice.</p>
        <p>By the advent of World War I, Lord Alfred had achieved a considerable reputation as a writer of sonnets. He had also made his name as one of the most vindictive and litigious men in England, a reputation he zealously maintained. In 1916, he tried to sue George Moore for writing a novel that represented Christ as merely a man. (This was ''The Brook Kerith,'' one of the most influential and consoling books of the era; happily, Douglas's application for a summons was rejected.) In 1918, he appeared in the Noel Pemberton Billing case, denouncing Wilde as ''the agent of the devil.'' Accused of libel for his commentary on a private performance of ''Salome,'' Billing won his case; cheered by the crowds, Douglas felt vindicated. In 1923, he accused Winston Churchill of having arranged, with the help of influential Jewish friends, the wartime death of Lord Kitchener. Kitchener's vessel had actually been hit by a German torpedo, but Douglas's claim made a good story. Six thousand copies of his libelous pamphlet sold in two days in the Strand alone. In court, it was revealed that his source was a bogus captain who had been certified as a lunatic. Douglas was declared guilty of libel and incarcerated for six months.</p>
        <p>Wilde had been destroyed by his prison experience; Douglas determined to make it his salvation. The 17 remarkable sonnets he wrote there were, he believed, a ''song of the soul at having arrived at the height of perfection.'' ''In Excelsis'' helped secure him a place as one of the great poets of the time.</p>
        <p>The story of Douglas's last years is as bizarre and fascinating as all that goes before it. He addressed a sonnet to Winston Churchill, which was gracefully received but did not win him the government pension he now badly needed. Help came instead from his long-suffering wife, from George Bernard Shaw and, most unexpectedly, from the queen of birth control, Marie Stopes, a poet herself. Impressionable young men were invited to tea at his lodgings and lectured on sonnet technique. Toward the end of his life, Douglas even wrote a short biography of Wilde in which he expressed sympathy with homosexuals and praised his former mentor as a genius. One of his last letters, in 1944, was an appeal to Churchill to defend the people of Poland from German invasion. Churchill thanked him for the advice and wished him a rapid return to health.</p>
        <p>Douglas's father had been a famous figure on the racecourse. His son's final act was to place a bet on a horse. It lost.</p>
