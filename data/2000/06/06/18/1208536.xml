        <p>The Hawk, one of the country's best-known mascots, will still be running around on the court at St. Joseph's University basketball games in Philadelphia and the crowd will be counting the numbers of times the Hawk can lap its wings and still not get off the ground -- as measured by the Flap-O-Meter. But the person inside the sometimes uncomfortably warm costume next school year will be Sarah Brennan of Point Pleasant Beach, the first woman Hawk since the mascot made its debut in 1956. Ms. Brennan will be a senior next year, and by virtue of being the Hawk, she will receive a full scholarship worth $16,000, said Larry Dougherty, assistant athletic director for media relations. But the fact that Ms. Brennan is a woman never entered into the competition, which is stiff. ''Once you get all the gear on, you can't tell anyway,'' said Ms. Brennan. ''I could just be a short guy for all anyone knows.''</p>
