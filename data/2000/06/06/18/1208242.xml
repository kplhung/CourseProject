        <p>American Symphony Orchestra League presents Westchester Philharmonic with Leonard Bernstein Award for Educational Programming for project in which local schoolchildren were allowed to choose composer to write piece for its series of spring school concerts at Performing Arts Center in Purchase; children selected 25-year-old David Mallamud as winner from group of five composers; photo (M)</p>

        <p>WHY not, the Westchester Philharmonic thought, when planning its education program, ''Exploring New Worlds: Music of the Americas''? Inspired by the centennial celebrations for Aaron Copland, the orchestra decided to invite a young American composer to write a piece for its series of spring school concerts at the Performing Arts Center in Purchase. And then a novel idea took hold: why not have the 7,800 Westchester schoolchildren who take part in the education program choose the composer themselves?</p>
        <p>The commissioning of 25-year-old David Mallamud, who was voted the winner after the children heard tapes by five composers, was grandly successful. In order to vote, the students, who attended third through sixth grade in 63 schools, learned about the composition process and different musical styles. Later they met Mr. Mallamud and became part of the premiere of a new, seven-minute piece, ''Par 80,'' at the April concerts.</p>

        <p>The commissioning of 25-year-old David Mallamud, who was voted the winner after the children heard tapes by five composers, was grandly successful. In order to vote, the students, who attended third through sixth grade in 63 schools, learned about the composition process and different musical styles. Later they met Mr. Mallamud and became part of the premiere of a new, seven-minute piece, ''Par 80,'' at the April concerts.</p>
        <p>Noting the orchestra's ''adventurous'' project, the American Symphony Orchestra League, which represents 850 orchestras, presented the Westchester Philharmonic with the Leonard Bernstein Award for Educational Programming at its annual conference last Friday in Boston. The award, which carries a $3,000 prize, was also presented on behalf of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. It was the only education award presented at the conference.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mallamud's piece will be played at the Philharmonic's subscription concerts at the Performing Arts Center on Nov. 11 and 12. The composer, winner of the 1998 Leonard Bernstein Young Composers Award, was also awarded a residency at the Copland House in Cortlandt, where he worked on writing ''Par 80.''</p>
