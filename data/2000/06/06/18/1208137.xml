        <p>IN the middle of Kirsten Childs's first musical, ''The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin,'' which opens on Tuesday at Playwrights Horizons, the main character, nicknamed Bubbly, auditions for a famous director and choreographer of sexy musicals called Director Bob.</p>
        <p>''You're a sweet kid, and you've got an irresistible smile,'' Director Bob tells her from offstage. ''So let's try that monologue one more time. But this time, don't go white on me, Bubbly.''</p>
        <p>More than two decades ago, Kirsten Childs herself auditioned for the famous director and choreographer Bob Fosse for a role in the national touring company of ''Chicago.'' At the time, her color, above all else, was green: she was straight out of college, it was her first audition and she didn't know who Bob Fosse was.</p>
        <p>Fosse, as Ms. Childs recalls it, never explicitly said she wasn't black enough: ''It was just implied.'' The role was ''a sassy black insane murderer,'' she said. ''I couldn't be the stereotypical sassy black woman. I was too repressed to play someone like that.''</p>
        <p>Fosse hired her anyway. She eventually became the lead, which was her first success in a career as a performer on Broadway (''Dancin,' ''  ''Jerry's Girls'' and ''Sweet Charity'') and in Hollywood (she played Richard Pryor's sister and Kevin Spacey's prisoner in ''See No Evil, Hear No Evil'').</p>
        <p>But it would be an error, she warned in a recent conversation at Playwrights Horizons, if people saw the connection between Bob Fosse and Director Bob as evidence that ''Bubbly Black Girl'' is strictly autobiographical. ''Early on, this was a performance piece and I was the performer,'' Ms. Childs said. ''It was difficult to separate myself.'' But over the five years since she began writing the lyrics, music and book, the work has grown into a full-fledged musical with dozens of characters played by a cast of 11 that does not include Ms. Childs.</p>
        <p>The show, partly developed at the O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., has received $185,000 in grants along the way, including Richard Rodgers development and production awards, Rockfeller Foundation and Jonathan Larson grants and the Edward Kleban award. The production is choreographed by A. C. Ciulla and directed by Wilfredo Medina. LaChanze plays the title role and Darius de Haas is Bubbly's childhood friend Gregory.</p>
        <p>In the two dozen musical numbers, ranging from pop to funk to rhythm and blues to classical to commercial jingle, the show follows Bubbly through three decades of her life. She starts as a smiling child in 1960's Los Angeles who prefers to play with her white doll and wants to be both the world's greatest dancer and white. She winds up a woman of 1990's New York who is no longer trying to be someone she is not.</p>
        <p>MS. CHILDS is herself a woman now, come into her own in New York, unmarried and (though she will not give her exact age) in her 40's. The daughter of two schoolteachers, she grew up, like her character, in Los Angeles. But she didn't have a perky nickname and she wanted neither to be white nor a dancer. ''All I wanted to be was safe and happy,'' she said. ''And I wasn't sure a little black girl like me could be.''</p>
        <p>The issues of race, gender, class and family that she explores in her musical, though, do come from a place deeply personal, which she kept hidden, especially from herself. She suspects now that Fosse saw not only her talent but her anger.</p>
        <p>''I was angry because I had to squelch my voice, to suppress all the feelings that were not acceptable to others,'' Ms. Childs said, ''including my family, the black community and the white community. For example, it seems to be wearying for white people to hear about the racism in America. I wrote the show to under stand where the anger and suppression came from.''</p>
