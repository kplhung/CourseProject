        <p>DESPITE being a hard sell, classical music is alive and well in the Hamptons. At least, that's what the founders of the three major music festivals on the South Fork hope as the season gets under way tomorrow with Pianofest opening its 12th year of presenting advanced piano students in weekly ''concerts with commentary.''</p>
        <p>Featuring 17 concerts over two weeks, the Music Festival of the Hamptons starts its fifth season on July 7. The Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival begins its 17th year on Aug. 2 with the first of 11 events over three weekends.</p>
        <p>What these festivals have in common is the presence of founders who have a stubborn need to put the Hamptons on the summer musical festival map. Paul Schenly, the director of the Cleveland International Piano Competition; Eleanor Sage Leonard, a decorator; Lucas Foss, the veteran pianist-conductor-composer; and Marya Martin, the celebrated flutist, are not musical entrepreneurs in the traditional sense.</p>
        <p>They all had dreams that they believed could be fulfilled on the East End, where they had summer homes. And where the deep pockets of potential donors, they thought, could provide the money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schenly, the founder of Pianofest, wanted to create ''a colony of pianists'' who would spend six hours a day five days a week for eight weeks honing their skills, taking lessons from world-class professionals, playing for colleagues and performing.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to emulate my own teacher, Victor Babin, a founder of Aspen,'' Mr. Schenly said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Leonard, the president of the Musical Festival of the Hamptons, wanted to honor her great uncle, Benno Moiseiwitsch, the concert pianist, with what she hopes will become ''a Tanglewood by the Sea.'' She first imported the Newport Music Festival and when that failed to attract an audience, Ms. Leonard, who has a house in Amagansett, established the current festival. Mr. Foss, a part-time resident of Bridgehampton, came aboard four years ago as artistic director.</p>
        <p>Artist-centered, the Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival owes its existence to Ms. Martin's desire ''to make great music'' and ''enjoy myself while doing it.'' Instead of going to ''every summer festival'' to play in the off-season, Ms. Martin decided to bring the music and her friends, a select group of chamber and solo musicians, to Bridgehampton, where she has a second home.</p>
        <p>Artistically, the level of music offered by the programs has been high, with critics and audiences applauding enthusiastically.</p>
        <p>In terms of fostering young talent, Pianofest has made its mark. Mr. Schenly began with 6 students; this year there are 16 from the age of 17 to the mid-20's who have come from Bulgaria, China, Korea, Russia, Taiwan and the United States. They live in dormitories at Southampton College and practice in a sprawling house in East Hampton where there are 10 pianos on loan from Steinway &amp; Sons. The eight weeks cost $6,000 and many of the students receive scholarship aid.</p>
        <p>The concertgoers, attracted by the $10 admission, are mostly members of the retirement community, Mr. Schenly conceded, and are beginning to ''age out.'' The two other festivals are faced with similar attrition. The ''graying of the audience'' is causing both to make concerted efforts to widen their appeal.</p>
        <p>The Music Festival of the Hamptons, with a budget of $411,000 and a deficit ''under $40,000,'' Ms. Leonard said, has ''a waiting list of three years for artists who want to participate,'' but so far has not been able to consistently sell out. This season the festival will be limited to its 800-seat tent in Bridgehampton and Guild Hall's 400-seat John Drew Theater for three recitals. Ticket prices have also been reduced to an average of $25.</p>
        <p>To widen its audience, Ms. Leonard said, the festival is programming four ''concerts that are suitable for grown-ups, but at the same time feature music for children,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The ''Family Concerts'' at 5 p.m. include ''Richard Stoltzman and Family,'' ''Arnold Steinhardt and Family'' and the Young People's Chorus of New York City.</p>
        <p>Although the Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival prides itself on running at 88 percent capacity, Ms. Martin agrees that like all classical musicians, she and her 32 participating colleagues are eager to attract more people in their 30's and 40's to their ''affordable'' concerts that cost $25. The festival operates on a break-even budget of about $300,000.</p>
        <p>This year the programming is  built around themes like ''East Wind,'' a concert of music from Eastern Europe, or ''Young at Heart,'' featuring Copland and Mendelssohn. ''This year, we've added another children's concert because of the demand,'' Ms. Martin said. The musicians include the pianist Ursula Oppens, the cellist Timothy Eddy, and the violinist Pamela Frank.</p>
        <p>''New audiences won't necessarily come to esoteric programs,'' Ms. Martin said. ''But we've found that once we get them there with something they find interesting, they return and begin to widen their scope. That's the only way to survive, create new audiences.''</p>
        <p>More information is available for Pianofest at (631) 329-9115, for the Music Festival of the Hamptons at (800) 644-4418 and for the Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival at (212) 741-9403.</p>
        <p>Free Youth Recitals</p>
        <p>From its new home on Crescent Beach on Shelter Island, the Perlman Music Program, which gives 39 young string players and pianists six weeks of intensive training, will hold weekly ''Works in Progress'' recitals. The free performances are at 7:30 p.m. on Fridays, beginning on July 14.</p>
        <p>The youngsters, from 11 to 18, will perform in a Mostly Mozart concert in Lincoln Center in Manhattan on Aug. 6 and in a benefit concert-dinner on Aug. 12 under a tent on the camp premises.</p>
        <p>Daily chamber, orchestral, choral and solo rehearsals are open to the public. The schedule is available each day at (631) 749-0740.</p>
