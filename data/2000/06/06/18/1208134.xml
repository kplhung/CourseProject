        <p>'Only yesterday,'' notes the copywriter for the Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux fall catalog, ''boys and girls spoke of embracing and kissing (necking) as getting to first base. Second base was deep kissing, plus groping and fondling this and that.'' No longer; first base is today deep kissing, also known as tonsil hockey. The writer then speeds up to date in orally touching second and rounding third base, which is now ''going all the way,'' and slides home with a surprise twist of the old sex-as-baseball metaphor: ''Home plate is being introduced by name.''</p>
        <p>The occasion for this recollection and updating of antediluvian teenage lingo is the promotion of a new book of essays and short fiction by Tom Wolfe titled ''Hooking Up.'' ''How rarely our hooked-up boys and girls are introduced by name!'' laments the promotion copy, which goes on to promise a chronicle of ''everything from the sexual manners and mores of teenagers to fundamental changes in the way human beings now regard themselves, thanks to the new fields of genetics and neuroscience.''</p>
        <p>Wolfe has a sensitivity to le mot juste in describing social phenomena. The title of his ''Right Stuff,'' a book about the early astronauts, has now become part of the language, as is his popularization of the mathematicians' pushing the envelope. In selecting hooking up as his title, he is again on the cusp of usage.</p>
        <p>When we hear a sultry seductress say to an aging Lothario, ''We'll hook up one of these days,'' what does her promise mean? (A Lothario is a male deceiver, from a character in Nicholas Rowe's 1703 play, ''The Fair Penitent.'' My need to point this out is what philologists call ''coinage compulsion.'')</p>
        <p>The compound noun hook-up (which The Times no longer hyphenates) was born in a political context in 1903, as ''a hook-up with the reform bunch,'' and meant a general linkage. In 1930, the term became specific, as ''a national hook-up'' came to denote a radio network.</p>
        <p>As a verb, to hook up has for a century also meant ''to marry,'' a synonym of ''to get hitched,'' as a horse is to a wagon. But not until the 1980's did the meaning change to a less formal sexual involvement. It was first defined as ''to pick someone up at a party'' and then progressed to ''become sexually involved with; to make out.''</p>
        <p>The swinging sense mainstreamed in 1995. ''A few women insist,'' wrote USA Today, ''they never go out with the intention of 'hooking up' or having sex,'' while a CNN commentator noted, ''The kids see shacking up and hooking up as the equivalent of marriage.'' In 1997, The Cleveland Plain Dealer quoted a Brown University student as saying, ''In a normal Brown relationship, you meet, get drunk, hook up and then either avoid eye contact the next day or find yourself in a relationship.'' The scholarly reporter noted, ''Depending on the context, a hook-up can mean anything from 20 minutes of strenuous kissing to spending the night together fully clothed to sexual intercourse.''</p>
        <p>To be hooked, taken from the fishing vocabulary, is to be addicted to drugs; however, with the addition of up to make the compound, the term has no sinister narcotics meaning. In current usage, which may not last long and is probably already fading, it most often means ''have a sexual relationship.'' Nor is the ''linking'' verb limited to American English. An exasperated Liz Jones, editor of Marie Claire, wrote in The Sunday Times of London this year about men who are habitual sexual deceivers (Lotharios), ''Are all men like this or is it just the ones I hook up with?''</p>
        <p>Let's go back to first base. Tonsil hockey, as used at Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux to mean ''deep kissing,'' is at least a decade old, having replaced tonsil boxing. A more recent variation is tongue sushi, which shows some metaphoric imagination: the Japanese sushi -- cold rice rolled up with bits of raw fish and vegetables -- is evoked to describe the mutual rolling-up of teenage linguae engaged in lubricious osculation.</p>
        <p>Tonsil hockey goalies have, in a spasm of good taste, rejected the phrase, popular in the 80's, ''to suck face.'' That undeniably vivid but odious locution seems to have been replaced in some localities with the almost euphemistic mess around. Its variants include mashing, macking (from smack, the sound of a kiss) and mugging , the senses of which run the semantic gamut from ''flirting'' to ''foreplay with no intention of intercourse.'' Those familiar with Old Slang would call it ''taking a long lead off first base.''</p>
        <p>Though hooking up seems a mediumistic metaphor for what used to be euphemized as ''sleeping together,'' it is more romantic than the phrase in current use on college campuses: parallel parking.</p>
        <p>Ligging</p>
        <p>Amorous Brits not yet ready to hook up traditionally get their kicks by snogging, their word for ''smooching.'' But they have another word for the lifestyle of the freeloader: ligging.</p>
        <p>''The Cannes Film Festival may or may not be a shrine to cinema,'' wrote Frederic Peugeot of Agence France-Presse last month, ''but one thing it certainly is: an adventure playground for liggers.'' He defined the noun as ''the camp followers who have developed the skills of freeloading and gate-crashing to a fine art.''</p>
        <p>The Daily Mail defines it as ''being on the list of every P.R. company, leading to a multitude of party invites. This results in the ligger existing on a diet that consists solely of free canapes and Champagne.'' The Times of London derided ''a lifetime of limelight ligging.''</p>
        <p>Lig is a dialect variation of lie. Ligging was first spotted by the O.E.D. in 1960 -- the mere 'ligging' layabout.'' The definition: ''to idle or lie about; also, (slang) to sponge, to 'freeload,' to gate-crash or attend parties.''</p>
        <p>This is a word from the mother country that zings home, and should be adopted in the colonies.</p>
