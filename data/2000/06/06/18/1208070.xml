        <p>Trading Twelves</p>
        <p>The Selected Letters of Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray.</p>
        <p>Edited by Albert Murray</p>
        <p>and John F. Callahan.</p>

        <p>Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray engaged in what Murray calls a ''lifelong dialogue about life, literary craft and American identity'' from the time they met in the early 1940's until Ellison's death in 1994. Much of it was conducted by mail, as the two writers did not live in the same city until Murray moved to New York in 1960. The letters in ''Trading Twelves,'' a selection of their correspondence from 1949 to 1960, edited by Murray and Ellison's literary executor, John F. Callahan, show the two beginning to emerge as writers. Ellison recounts the completion and phenomenal reception of ''Invisible Man,'' which was published in 1952; Murray describes the genesis of what would become his first novel, ''Train Whistle Guitar,'' which would appear in 1974. Not surprisingly, these young men -- Ellison was 35 years old in 1949, Murray 33 -- are almost self-consciously bookish; they tell each other what they have read and what the other should be reading. More than books, however, Ellison and Murray discussed jazz -- concerts attended, records heard, bebop condemned. Their excited interchanges mimic the call-and-response of jazz improvisation, and indeed the writing in these letters is far more successful at fusing literature to jazz technique than in their published work. Ultimately, though, the greatest pleasure to be found in ''Trading Twelves'' is the warmth of friendship. ''Maybe if there were not so many things I'd rather talk to you about than anybody else I know,'' Murray wrote in 1959, ''I could do a better job of just keeping in touch.''</p>
