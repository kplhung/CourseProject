        <p>YES, we have some bananas. But how do they get here?</p>
        <p>The life cycle of a typical New York City banana goes like this: it is grown in Ecuador, comes to the United States on a boat that docks on Staten Island, and is ultimately purchased at a fruit stand, bodega or grocery store. The prime mover is Teddy Georgallas, part owner of Banana Distributors of New York, which operates out of a warehouse on Drake Street in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx.</p>

        <p>YES, we have some bananas. But how do they get here?</p>
        <p>The life cycle of a typical New York City banana goes like this: it is grown in Ecuador, comes to the United States on a boat that docks on Staten Island, and is ultimately purchased at a fruit stand, bodega or grocery store. The prime mover is Teddy Georgallas, part owner of Banana Distributors of New York, which operates out of a warehouse on Drake Street in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx.</p>
        <p>At the Korean market at Broadway and 87th Street, bananas sell for 59 cents a pound, about 25 cents a banana, which is amazing when you think about all it takes to get it here. Teddy Georgallas is one of the few who does; not just this banana, but 100 million others like it.</p>
        <p>The bananas Mr. Georgallas trades are grown on plantations in Ecuador by farmers who sell their crop to Pacific Fruit, an Ecuadorean company owned by the Naboa family. Pacific Fruit ships them to the United States under the brand name Bonita.</p>
        <p>American Banana takes delivery at the dock in Staten Island. Off the boat, the bananas are ''full green.'' The key to the wholesale banana trade is the ripening. At its Hunts Point warehouse, American Banana maintains 22 pressurized and refrigerated ripening rooms, where the bananas are kept at 58 degrees before sale.</p>
        <p>A bulk retailer like Costco may prefer to buy its bananas ''50-50 green and yellow,'' and sells them in five-pound bags.</p>
        <p>A bodega owner who buys bananas three times a week may prefer his banana ''full yellow'' or ''yellow with green tips.'' When a customer calls in his order, Mr. Georgallas translates it into ''one box from Room 3 and two from Room 12.''</p>
        <p>The entire ripening process takes five to eight days.</p>
        <p>Banana Distributors' main warehouse is just outside the New York City Terminal Market. Being outside the market allows Mr. Georgallas to charge a bit more than dealers inside the market because he saves his customers the trouble of parking and traversing the market's chaotic loading docks. Currently a box of bananas sells for about $10.</p>
        <p>Being on the outside also allows customers, even those with other business inside, to buy their bananas at the end of their run. That way, the perishable fruit spends less time on a delivery truck.</p>
        <p>''People want to put their bananas on last,'' Mr. Georgallas said.</p>
        <p>Over the years, big supermarket chains have invested in their own ripening rooms, so Banana Distributors now sells mostly to independent supermarkets and smaller stores. The chains still call on American Banana and other Hunts Point dealers for  emergency orders.</p>
        <p>In addition to bananas, Mr. Georgallas sells a full line of ''tropicals'' and other produce. Most of the other produce, as many as 200 items at a time, is sold from Banana Distributors' unit on Row D of the market.</p>
        <p>Banana Distributors buys its bananas by the pallet (a pallet contains 48 boxes) and loads them onto trucks that hold 20 pallets each (or 960 boxes). The company sells about 20 truckloads a week. With roughly 100 bananas in a 40-pound box, that works out to 1.9 million bananas every week and just under 100 million bananas a year. Which is a lot of bananas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Georgallas says he grosses $500,000 a week, roughly the same as his competitors, American Banana, Top Banana, and Long Island Banana, among others.</p>
        <p>Wholesale produce is an all-night business. Banana Distributors is open from midnight until 2 in the afternoon. These days, Mr. Georgallas starts work at 6 a.m. But there were times he had to start work so early that he woke up before midnight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Georgallas, 41, has been a banana man his whole life. Like most of the distributors in Hunts Point, Banana Distributors is a family business.</p>
        <p>His father and uncle started the company 50 years ago in East Harlem. The company moved to Hunts Point in 1966, in anticipation of the market's opening there in 1967. It went to its present location in 1979.</p>
        <p>Mr. Georgallas worked summers at the warehouse. He had hoped to become a  schoolteacher, but family finances called him back to the banana trade, and he became a partner with his cousin and brother-in-law 18 years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Georgallas's daughter is 3, too young to think about her career. But his brother-in-law Paul Rosenblatt has a son who has just graduated from college.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenblatt hopes that his son will find another line of work. ''Not that it's too hard,'' he said. ''I'd just as soon he do something else. I told him, 'Don't even think about it,' until he has five years in another job.''</p>
        <p>Most family businesses, he says, tend to slip in the third generation, and the banana business is no different.</p>
        <p>Still, wholesale produce is not for upstarts. Outsiders, even those who buy an existing company, tend to fail.</p>
        <p>It is a business of relationships, and customers are reluctant to change suppliers.  Some have tried to break in ''by giving the product away,'' Mr. Georgallas said.</p>
        <p>''But it's hard to make money that way.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Rosenblatt's son doesn't take over, who will? In other cities, Mr. Rosenblatt says, growers like Bonita or Chiquita Banana have bought out the distributors. If that happens here, bananas may still flow into the Bronx, but it won't be Bronx men selling them.</p>
