      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In computer software terminology, the ''version 2.0'' of a program is generally the first major revision to the original product, where old mistakes are fixed and new features are added. As one might guess from the title, Caroline Preston's warm and engaging second novel, LUCY CROCKER 2.0 (Scribner, $23), is about a woman's decision to revise her own life. Part midlife catharsis, part wilderness adventure story, the book also brings a human touch to the world of computers. Lucy is a painter and former librarian living in Massachusetts, and she is married to Ed, a software company president; they have teenage twin sons who started their own computer consulting business while in fourth grade. Asked to produce paintings and puzzles for a sequel to a computer fantasy game she had designed, Lucy procrastinates until Ed, goaded by Ingrid, his company's publicity director, fires her from the project. After she discovers that Ed and Ingrid are engaging in after-work activities of their own (often involving huckleberry massage oil), and catches her sons surfing for porn on the Internet, Lucy is prompted to action. She signs up her protesting twins for a rigorous canoe trip, and then she takes off on a sojourn of her own to her family's old cabin in the Wisconsin woods. Although the book's plot can be predictable in places, Preston gives us strong, complex characters who each end up striving to correct the bugs and glitches plaguing their lives.</p>
