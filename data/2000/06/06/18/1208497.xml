        <p>Amid the haze of incense, the choral chants of ''Hallelujah'' and the overall gravitas of ancient Roman Catholic rites, the most crucial moment over the next two days of worship and celebration at St. Patrick's Cathedral actually comes down to a small bit of papal paperwork.</p>
        <p>This afternoon, a letter from Pope John Paul II appointing Edward M. Egan the archbishop of New York will be read aloud. Then, Msgr. Edward D. O'Donnell, the chancellor of the archdiocese, will notarize it, stamp it with the diocesan seal and order it deposited in the archives.</p>
        <p>At that moment, the installation of New York's ninth archbishop will be official under canon law. But the praying and the partying will have just begun.</p>
        <p>The installation of a Catholic archbishop typically offers a balance of solemnity and revelry, of spectacular pageantry and pious introspection. It is a time for jestful greetings and for serious talk about the future of the diocese. The program for today and tomorrow incorporates it all.</p>
        <p>The worship will take place during two services at St. Patrick's. Today, the archbishop's official appointment, called a Ceremony of Canonical Possession, will precede the regular late afternoon service of solemn vespers. Tomorrow, hundreds of dignitaries will attend a celebratory Mass.</p>
        <p>The spectacle will come from two processionals, one of them a parade tomorrow from the Catholic Center, on First Avenue and 56th Street, to St. Patrick's, with at least eight cardinals, 18 archbishops, more than 100 bishops and many priests and nuns.</p>
        <p>Presiding over much of the official ceremony will be Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo, the apostolic nuncio who serves in Washington as the Vatican's ambassador to the United States. He will welcome and present the new archbishop to local prelates and read the pope's letter of appointment.</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan will be the principal celebrant of both today's vespers service and tomorrow's Mass. He will wear festive white vestments, which Msgr. Ferdinando Berardi, the coordinating master of ceremonies, said represent continuity in the church. He added that the installation of the archbishop was a moment to reflect on thousands of years of church traditions.</p>
        <p>Today's ceremony will begin about 3:30 p.m. with a procession of banners, led by one proclaiming ''Unus Dominus, Una Fides, Unum Baptisma'' -- ''One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism.''</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, the processional from the Catholic Center will begin about 1 p.m., with members of religious orders, students, seminarians, deacons and priests in front and and bishops, archbishops, cardinals and finally Bishop Egan at the rear. The choir will sing ''Hallelujah'' as he enters St. Patrick's.</p>
