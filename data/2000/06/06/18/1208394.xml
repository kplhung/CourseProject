        <p>EXCEPT for the shouting, it is becoming clear that the debate over employee privacy is over.</p>
        <p>The American Management Association conducts an annual survey on electronic monitoring and surveillance in the workplace, and the latest results, released a few weeks ago, show that widespread, routine snooping on employees is no longer a threat but a fact. Nearly three-quarters of the large American companies that responded to the survey said they actively record and review at least one of the following: employees' phone calls, e-mail, Internet connections and computer files. That is twice the rate of snooping as in 1997. And one company in four has fired an employee over what the surveillance turned up.</p>

        <p>EXCEPT for the shouting, it is becoming clear that the debate over employee privacy is over.</p>
        <p>The American Management Association conducts an annual survey on electronic monitoring and surveillance in the workplace, and the latest results, released a few weeks ago, show that widespread, routine snooping on employees is no longer a threat but a fact. Nearly three-quarters of the large American companies that responded to the survey said they actively record and review at least one of the following: employees' phone calls, e-mail, Internet connections and computer files. That is twice the rate of snooping as in 1997. And one company in four has fired an employee over what the surveillance turned up.</p>
        <p>So the ethical quandary over whether to monitor will soon be moot. Factors like fear of sexual harassment litigation, lost employee productivity and theft of proprietary data and software have swamped any hesitations about privacy. It is almost a cinch that your employer will be having a peek at what you're up to -- if not today, then tomorrow.</p>
        <p>If monitoring is a given, a new challenge for employers takes center stage: setting up a monitoring system that is ethical and fair to all employees, and not merely defensible in court.</p>
        <p>A key issue, of course, is: Who will do the monitoring? And that is where things get sticky.</p>
        <p>Two approaches are possible. Monitoring could become a full-time job for a person or department, or could be made a sidelight among other responsibilities. Each presents problems.</p>
        <p>When policing co-workers is someone's main job, human nature creates a real danger. The designated monitor will have every incentive to find problems to justify his or her job, said N. Ben Fairweather, a research fellow at the Center for Computing and Social Responsibility in Leicester, England. Once the egregious offenders are weeded out, an effective monitoring program can easily devolve into a wild, self-perpetuating array of witch hunts and speed traps -- an ethically unjustifiable state of affairs, however one may feel about monitoring in the abstract.</p>
        <p>More often, monitoring is assigned to people or departments that mainly do something else. Typically, the job goes to information-technology people, for no better reason than that they are usually the only ones who have the necessary access to hardware and software and know how it all works, on the snoop's side as well as the user's.</p>
        <p>But think again of human nature. Making snooping a sideline is likely to lead to wild inconsistency, occasional incompetence or outright capriciousness in the way monitoring is applied and policies are enforced.</p>
        <p>I don't meant to suggest that technical people are reckless or capricious. Only a fool would make such an observation and expect his office Internet connection to ever work smoothly  again.</p>
        <p>It's just that the do-it-in-your-spare-time approach is doomed from the outset. People will naturally devote most of their time and attention to their principal responsibilities -- the ones that figure in whether they get promotions and raises -- and turn to monitoring only when they have the time and inclination. Inevitably, that means inconsistent enforcement, which can be worse than none at all.</p>
        <p>''Generally, in all areas of corporate management, the idea of having a policy is a good one, but it's not enough,'' said Jeffrey D. Neuburger, a lawyer specializing in technology-related issues at Brown Raysman Millstein Felder &amp; Steiner, a Manhattan firm. ''If you don't enforce it, you're almost better off not having a policy, because you get charged with this standard that you're telling the world that you're going to live under.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Neuberger's point is one both of fairness and of vulnerability in court. A company sued by an employee over a claim of sexual harassment can find itself in trouble, for example, if it can be demonstrated that the company adopted a policy against viewing Internet pornography on office computers but did not consistently enforce the policy. It won't do much for the company's defense to have some harried systems analyst testify  that checking the logs for naughty downloads was item No. 137 on her weekly to-do list.</p>
        <p>A survey earlier this year by Elron Software, a publisher of monitoring software, shows that Internet policy enforcement is far from airtight. One-tenth of workers responding to the survey said they had seen co-workers viewing adult Web sites on the job; more than half of that 10 percent said their companies had explicit policies forbidding it.</p>
        <p>If full-time snoops are prone to overzealousness and part-timers to inconsistency, what is the right way to manage routine monitoring? There isn't one.</p>
        <p>The ethical approach is to use snooping the way the police are supposed to use searches and telephone taps: only when warranted. ''There might be a need for monitoring, but only after the organization has good grounds for suspecting that there is abuse,'' Dr. Fairweather said.</p>
        <p>In other words, he snoops fairest who snoops least, and then only with cause.</p>
