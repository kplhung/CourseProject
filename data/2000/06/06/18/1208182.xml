        <p>YOU are a weekend golfer, have few recreational hours and also have no patience to hit ball after ball at the driving range. How can you improve your game?</p>
        <p>Under the circumstances, lower your expectations. So says New Canaan's Dave Eichelberger, the defending champion in the United States Senior Open (June 29-July 2) at the Saucon Valley Country Club in Bethleham, Pa.</p>
        <p>''As a senior,'' Eichelberger said, ''unless you practice and play three to four times a week year-round, you are just kidding yourself if you think you will ever break 85 regularly or own a single-figure handicap, especially in the Northeast where the weather shortens the season.''</p>
        <p>Eichelberger suggests refining your short game as a more productive option to trimming strokes from your scores and breaking 100 regularly.</p>
        <p>''Of course, you still need to practice full-swing shots,'' he said. ''But work on getting the ball down from 30 yards out, preferably over some kind of obstacle simulating a mound or sand trap. You can do that in your backyard using a lawnchair, or even in your basement if there is nothing to break down there.''</p>
        <p>''Try to hole out routinely in three and maybe even get down in two once in a while. That's the most effective way of eliminating wasted strokes and maintaining a respectable handicap,'' he continued.</p>
        <p>The most common swing fault Eichelberger sees in weekend golfers?</p>
        <p>''Hitting from the top and using the hands instead of the whole body,'' he said. ''From the top of the backswing, it's critical that you start the downswing with the hips. Then the shoulders, armed and hands follow in the proper sequence, allowing you to uncoil and deliver the clubhead effectively.''</p>
