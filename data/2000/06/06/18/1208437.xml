        <p>Folk Implosion, musical duo made up of Lou Barlow and John Davis, is set to perform at Maxwell's in Hoboken, NJ (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>For something more sedate and identifiable than the Dysfunctional Family Picnic, but equally hip, the Folk Implosion (Lou Barlow and John Davis) are playing at Maxwell's in Hoboken at 10 p.m. Friday. Mr. Barlow has attracted a cult following through his tenure with the groundbreaking lo-fi band Sebadoh, and his work with Folk Implosion is another musical winner.</p>
        <p>The duo's sometimes languorous, other times grinding, almost always dreamy sound suspends time with multilayered, sonically rich gems. Their latest CD ''One Part Lullaby,'' was one of last year's best: a commanding mix of rhythmic minimalism, crunchy rock and brittle pop. The songs are atmospheric, melodic and packed with luxuriant harmonies and thoughtful lyrics. One track seduces back to the trippy 1960's, while another slams right into 2000 with its cold-hearted synth.</p>

        <p>The Folk Implosion, one of the most inventive, compelling and musical bands on the rock scene, easily prove that less is more.</p>
