        <p>The question was whether the last of the trio of London's riverside millennium projects could have an unembarrassing inauguration, and the answer, for all to see, was blowing in the wind.</p>
        <p>A new foot bridge, the sleek creation of the noted British architect Norman Foster, opened to the public and closed a day later after it began to sway violently in the Thames breezes, sending pedestrians lurching about. Engineers will spend the rest of the summer reinforcing the span.</p>
        <p>The London Eye, a giant Ferris wheel across the river from the Houses of Parliament, also had a calamitous start after rising from barges in the river to full height and barely clearing the water before collapsing. The $1.2 billion Millennium Dome at Greenwich had its disastrous debut on New Year's Eve, when thousands of guests were held in line for hours before being admitted. Among them were the editors of almost all the national newspapers, which have been getting their revenge ever since, gleefully highlighting the shortfall in projected visitor numbers and the widespread public disappointment with the display.</p>
