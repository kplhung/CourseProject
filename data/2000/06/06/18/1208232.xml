        <p>ALTHOUGH the House of Representatives voted this month to kill the federal tax now imposed on estates that exceed $675,000, the promise of a presidential veto has left tax planners with ample incentive to continue advising clients about how to reduce taxes on assets they will ultimately pass to their heirs.</p>
        <p>And with skyrocketing property values in the metropolitan area helping to propel more people into tax brackets that could expose their estates to taxes -- at rates of up to 55 percent -- the planners say that one of the most talked-about estate-planning strategies is the Family Limited Partnership.</p>
        <p>''F.L.P.'s are one of the hottest financial planning tools around,'' said Martin Shenkman, a Manhattan tax lawyer. ''They've been packaged and sold as the estate-planning wonder drug of the decade.'' Mr. Shenkman added, however, that like any estate-planning strategy, a Family Limited Partnership must be used as only part of an ''integrated overall estate and financial plan.''</p>
        <p>A Family Limited Partnership, Mr. Shenkman said, is a business entity formed by members of a family to own and manage family assets -- including real estate purchased as an investment. (Since F.L.P.'s must have a business purpose to survive Internal Revenue Service scrutiny, they are  not used for primary residences or homes used solely for vacations. Second homes that are rented out most of the year may be eligible.)</p>
        <p>As with any limited partnership, he said, the F.L.P. has general partners who run the business or manage the property -- usually the parents -- and limited partners who have no say in management -- usually the children.</p>
        <p>And while the stated purpose of an F.L.P. is to function as a family business created to own and control one or more of the family's assets, Mr. Shenkman said, one benefit of such an arrangement is that the F.L.P. can be used to transfer assets from the parents to the children in a way that minimizes or even eliminates estate taxes.</p>
        <p>Ralph Engel, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in estate planning, explained that the tax savings that can be obtained using an F.L.P. are the result of three factors: the way that assets are contributed to the partnership, the way that ownership of the partnership itself is apportioned, and the way that each partner's share of the partnership is valued for tax purposes.</p>
        <p>In most cases, Mr. Engel said, assets like investment properties and securities are transferred to the F.L.P. by the general partners. And while the general partners usually retain total control over management of the partnership business, the documents used to create an F.L.P. typically give the general partners only a small percentage of the actual ownership interest in the partnership.</p>
        <p>''The general partners can have as little as 1 percent interest in the partnership,'' Mr. Engel said, adding that the remaining ownership interests would be allocated as limited-partnership interests. Those interests would then be given as gifts to the children. What that accomplishes, he said, is that it allows parents to transfer assets like investment properties into a partnership owned almost entirely by the children -- without requiring the parents to relinquish day-to-day control.</p>
        <p>And while the value of the transferred partnership interests would be considered a gift for federal gift and estate tax purposes -- thereby using up all or part of the $675,000 gift and estate tax credit available to each parent (an amount that gradually increases to $1 million in 2006) -- a significant tax savings ultimately results because of the way the partnership interests are valued.</p>
        <p>Mr. Engel explained that since property owned by a limited partnership is under the total control of the general partner, the value of each limited partner's ownership interest is less than what it would be if they owned the property outright.</p>
        <p>For example, he said, if property with a current market value of $1.5 million is put into an F.L.P. consisting of a general partner who owns 1 percent of the partnership and three limited partners who own 33 percent each, it is unlikely that any individual limited partner's share would be worth $495,000 (33 percent of $1.5 million). That is because the general partner still has total control over the property and because each of the limited partners has only a minority interest.</p>
        <p>''That means that putting the property in the F.L.P. and transferring limited-partnership interests to the children results in a discount of its value for federal gift and estate tax purposes,'' he said, adding that the amount of the discount -- which must be determined by an appraiser -- can range anywhere from 25 to 60 percent of the market value of the property before the transfer.</p>
        <p>As a result, he said, it is possible for a husband and wife to transfer $1.5 million worth of investment property into an F.L.P. -- and, ultimately, into the names of their children -- while using up as little as $600,000 of their combined gift and estate tax exemption.</p>
        <p>Ronald A. Fatoullah, a Forest Hills, Queens, estate-planning lawyer, said that with careful planning and sufficient time, it may even be possible for a married couple to transfer investment property to their children without exposing any of the value to gift and estate taxes.</p>
        <p>''What many people do is they gift shares of the F.L.P. to their children or grandchildren in $10,000 yearly increments,'' he said, explaining that under current tax law, a husband and wife can each give each child and grandchild a tax-free gift of up to $10,000 a year. Accordingly, Mr. Fatoullah said, instead of creating an F.L.P. with the children owning the majority of the limited-partnership interests from the inception, some people will instead spread out the transfer of those interests over a period of years to take maximum advantage of the $10,000 annual gift exclusion.</p>
        <p>So, he said, a husband and wife who have three children and $1.5 million worth of investment property can transfer $60,000 worth of limited partnership interests each year to the children without using up any of their gift and estate tax credits. And if the value of the partnership interests were to be discounted by, say, 50 percent, that same couple would actually be transferring up to $120,000 in real property value each year.</p>
        <p>The three lawyers interviewed for this article emphasized several points. First, no one estate-planning strategy is right for every situation.  For example, while F.L.P.'s can produce significant estate tax savings, the beneficiaries would in all likelihood have to pay capital-gains taxes when they ultimately sell the property.</p>
        <p>Moreover, since the F.L.P. is a partnership, the general partner is personally liable for any claims against the partnership. Accordingly, those who have serious concerns about liability might want to opt for a Limited Liability Company, a business structure that provides benefits similar to those of an F.L.P. while limiting the liability of members to their actual investment.</p>
