        <p>It has taken a while, but big earrings are really big now, especially chandeliers -- beaded three-inch pendants studded with rhinestones and other bits of costume bijoux. At last October's European collections, Michelle Kessler, Vogue's accessories director, broke the code of minimalism when she wore a pair of R. J. Graziano's chandelier earrings against her long, straight hair. Soon, they dangled in November Vogue and January Allure. Despite these glossy endorsements, big didn't excite retailers. ''None of the stores picked them up because of the whole minimalism thing,'' Wendy Converse, sales manager at R. J. Graziano, said.

        <p>Not being available made the earrings ($125 for the ones at left) all the more desirable to fashion insiders. Jane Lauder called for a pair after seeing them on Cara Kagan, beauty director at Elle, who has 30 pairs in different shapes and lengths. The models Heidi Klum and Gisele got theirs at fashion shoots. Katie Couric placed an order after spotting them on a ''Today'' show segment. Fashion outsiders can place orders at (212) 685-3737.</p>
