        <p>YOU know them but you don't know them. The guy who squeezes the Charmin. The man who makes the doughnuts. The frogs that croak, ''Bud - Weis - Er.''</p>
        <p>For thousands of actors, commercial work -- both voice-overs and on camera -- pays the bills. But those actors are now spending their days on picket lines instead of at auditions.</p>
        <p>''There are lots of us in Westchester, and this is how we make our mortgage payments,'' said Stephanie Garry, an actress from Chappaqua who has been the voice of Toys ''R'' Us, Sudafed, the New York Lottery and Shoplink.com. ''Right now I have no income except for the jobs I had prior to the strike. I think my income for the year is going to be down between 50 to 75 percent this year. It's going to be really hard to recoup.''</p>
        <p>The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which represent 135,000 actors nationwide (most of whom are out of work at any given time) have been on strike since May 1. At issue is how actors should be paid for their work in commercials.</p>
        <p>The vast majority of the actors affected by the strike are not big names. Rather they are those who go from audition to audition, hoping to be the face or voice to represent a pain killer or a dishwashing liquid.</p>
        <p>Robb Pruitt of New Rochelle, who is currently the voice of the blue M&amp;M, said: ''Nearly every actor, even if they've played a Broadway show, desires or needs to do commercial work to supplement or make their income. I just moved to Westchester, and I like it a lot, but my life will change drastically if we don't get this contract. I told my neighbors they shouldn't get too used to me.''</p>
        <p>Under their current contract, actors are paid for ads broadcast on network television on a pay-per-play formula -- the more a commercial runs, the more the actor is paid. The union wants to expand that formula to cable, for which actors now receive only a flat fee. They also want to establish a new payment structure for the Internet.</p>
        <p>Advertisers would like to do away with residuals altogether. They argue that the pay-per-play formula is based on an outdated notion of the media market of the 1950's and 60's, when there were only three television networks. Today's audience, advertisers argue, is splintered by cable, and the union's proposal would impose excessive costs on cable advertising. Advertisers are offering actors a substantial increase in fees in exchange for unlimited use of commercials.</p>
        <p>The strike has focused attention on actors who often labor anonymously and whose profession has several quirky features.</p>
        <p>Actors who may spend their days portraying an enormous stuffed nose or a singing giraffe say the pay-per-play formula is critical for several reasons. First, actors sign contracts of exclusivity with the companies they represent, so they argue they should be compensated for being put out of the running for other jobs.</p>
        <p>''If they've featured someone in their commercial, that same face or voice can't appear for the competition,'' said Anne Gartlan, an actress from Bronxville who has done commercials for dozens of companies and is currently the voice on the Prilosec commercial. (''It's Prilosec time.'') ''You become exclusive to that product and that has to be paid for.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gartlan also said actors are type-cast by appearing in certain advertisements. ''If you become associated with a product, you then often have your voice and face in casting director and advertising heads, so they say: 'Let's not hire her, she's a laxative. I don't want her in my beer commercial.' ''</p>
        <p>In fact, actors argue that commercial work is peculiar in that success can lead to a lack of work, because an actor can be overexposed.</p>
        <p>''How many other campaigns did Mr. Whipple ever do, or Marge the Manicurist for Palmolive or Sam Breakstone?'' asked Paul Christie of Edgemont, who has worked for dozens of companies including Chrysler, Blockbuster Video and Canon and who also does cartoon voices. ''There can be an over saturation to the point that you're done.''</p>
        <p>He argued that if an actor is paid each time a popular commercial runs, at least he is compensated until his image has faded from the public mind.</p>
        <p>Another issue peculiar to actors who do commercials is what is known in the industry as ''disgusting product'' work. Selling medications for constipation, hemorrhoids, vaginal itching and the like can hurt an actor's chances of appearing in sexier beer or car commercials.</p>
        <p>''It's not a bad thing if you're the person prescribing the product, but if you're the one with the problem, oh my God,'' said Ms. Garry, who added that she thought she would have been ''scarred for life'' had she appeared in a spot for Depends undergarments, which she auditioned for. (For the first time in her life, she was relieved she didn't get the job.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Gartlan agreed, recalling her nervousness at an audition for Vagisil. ''It's going to be way different if you were talking about the product than if you had the problem,'' she said. ''The woman who was hired to say, 'If Vagisil can cure my yeast infection it can cure yours' -- I've never seen her again, because they ran that thing to death.''</p>
        <p>Clearly, it is not all about glamour. And these actors argue that there is a huge misconception about the nature of their work. To the public it appears that actors show up in a booth, tape a commercial and then sit at home and collect money. In fact, the bulk of their time is spent auditioning. And it's a system with little seniority. Actors who have been in the business 25 years audition with everyone else.</p>
        <p>''I tell people I ride the subway for a living,'' Ms. Gartlan said. ''If you look at the rates we get paid, they are nice, but I have to go on 20 to 50 auditions to book a job. The work is the easy part, but how long did it take me to do that spot -- five minutes and 25 years. We make it look easy, but we're professionals.''</p>
        <p>Paul Christie said: ''You have two things for sale. One is your talent -- your voice and your face. The other thing is your time. The majority of my day is unpaid time, going from one agency to another, one casting director to another, and being available at the last minute.''</p>
        <p>Last week, federal mediators were brought in to the strike talks. The actors are eager to return to work. They describe the friendly relationships they have with advertisers and casting directors, many of whom say hello when they pass the picket lines.</p>
        <p>''The people I work for are my friends,''  Mr. Pruitt said. ''I do represent these people and I'm not trying to impede their livelihood so much as I'm trying to make a living.''</p>
