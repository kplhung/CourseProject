        <p>JUST a few years ago, lawmakers were in full cry about the supposed dangers of immigration -- from crime to welfare cheats to lost jobs.</p>
        <p>Yet now Congress is poised to pass a bill that would grant visas to tens of thousands more temporary high-tech workers from abroad. And an unlikely coalition of business and immigrants rights groups is pushing to fling the door open wider: to unskilled workers who could fill shortages in hotels and on farms, and even to roll back an array of restrictive measures passed with great fanfare in 1996.</p>
        <p>Clearly, the national conversation about immigrants and immigration has changed dramatically. Representative Howard L. Berman, a Democrat from California, described the political momentum generated by the temporary workers bill this way: ''There's a train going through. Can I get on it?''</p>
        <p>Sometime later this summer, Congress is expected to pass H1B, which would nearly double, to 200,000, the number of such visas issued every year for the next three years. The measure has bipartisan support, including the blessings of both presumptive Presidential candidates .</p>
        <p>If it passes, H1B will be the largest guest worker measure since the 1942 bracero program, which imported millions of Mexicans farmworkers into virtual servitude, until it was dismantled in 1964.</p>
        <p>A broad new service industry coalition, representing everything from hospitals to hotels, is seeking its own temporary workers from abroad. And agribusiness, which has unsuccessfully lobbied for temporary field workers in the past, has renewed its efforts.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, traditional immigrants rights groups are urging lawmakers to lift the 1996 measures that bar immigrants from some government benefits, tighten political asylum rules and require the automatic deportation of non-citizens who had been convicted of certain felony crimes.</p>
        <p>A coalition calling itself ''Fix 96,'' is urging lawmakers to repeal the mandatory deportation law and restore social security benefits and food stamps to immigrants who arrived after 1996; benefits to pre-1996 immigrants have already been restored.</p>
        <p>Another coalition of business and civil rights groups is calling on Congress to grant legal status to some 300,000 immigrants who fled political violence in El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti and Honduras but were denied refugee status in this country. The same group wants Congress to raise the cap on family reunification visas, while religious leaders and a left-right coalition led by Henry Cisneros and Jack Kemp have called for amnesty for others who have lived here illegally for many years.</p>
        <p>In what Rick Swartz, a leading immigration lobbyist, calls the ''H1B- plus'' strategy, activists are trying to bundle both the family reunification and amnesty proposals with the high-tech worker bill, turning it into a kind of omnibus immigration measure.</p>
        <p>''The economy is very strong right now and who knows what it's going to look like a year from now,'' Mr. Swarz said. ''A strong economy enables you to do more. Secondly, an election year in which the politics of immigration may be more positive than negative. Third, you have both major presidential candidates being pro-immigrant at least in their rhetoric.''</p>
        <p>Of course, good times have usually meant open doors, and these are, economically, the best times ever. Still, none of the other immigration bills enjoy anything like the consensus surrounding H1B. The farm lobby's guest  worker bill, which the House immigration subcommittee debated Thursday, is likely to face strong opposition from labor and Latino groups, who don't accept the industry's claims of a labor shortage. They want a provision to legalize the immigration status of farm workers, a majority of whom are undocumented Hispanic immigrants, while the industry bill would allow some farm workers to gain permanent residency.</p>
        <p>John Young, executive director of the New England Apple Council who heads the immigration committee of the National Council of Agricultural Employers, remains optimistic. ''I think the opportunity is very good for passage, better than it has been in the past few years,'' he said.</p>
        <p>ASERVICE industry umbrella group called the Essential Worker Coalition also cites labor shortages in tourism and other trades, and has just begun what it likes to call an H1B program tailored for groundskeepers, housekeepers and other low-skilled workers, many of them seasonal.</p>
        <p>''The high-tech industry has done a very good job in making their case,'' argued John Gay, a lobbyist for the American Hotel and Motel association and a spokesman for the coalition. ''We need to do the same making our case.''</p>
        <p>Many service industry workers are illegal immigrants from Central America and Haiti, and Mr. Gay's group has thrown its support behind the National Council of La Raza, a leading Latino rights group, which proposes amnesty for undocumented immigrants who have lived and worked here since 1986.</p>
        <p>One area in which there has been little movement has been the restoration of government benefits that were cut in 1996. A number of bills have been introduced to repeal the mandatory deportation law, but none have made it out of the immigration subcommittees. Efforts to restore the due process rights of asylum-seekers have had a similar fate.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Swartz, the reason is clear. ''It's harder to get the business community to support a bill on the legal rights of people getting deported,'' he pointed out, ''than to get a legalization program for Central Americans who are working in their restaurants.''</p>
