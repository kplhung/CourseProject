        <p>IT'S hard to turn a Ford into a Ferrari.</p>
        <p>Yet that is what a lot of investors expected would happen at Procter &amp; Gamble, the $40 billion consumer products giant, after Durk I. Jager was installed as chief executive about 18 months ago. Mr. Jager had committed the company to shifting out of cruise control.</p>
        <p>But some people on Wall Street now think that he nearly stripped the gears. Procter missed its higher earnings estimates for the last couple of quarters, and its stock is down nearly 50 percent so far this year. This month, Mr. Jager resigned.</p>
        <p>That leaves A. G. Lafley, his successor, in a tough spot.</p>
        <p>Heather Hay, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, took some time last week to talk about the company and its prospects. Following are excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q. Some have argued that Durk Jager was victimized by Wall Street, which wanted and expected Procter &amp; Gamble to grow faster than it realistically could. Do you agree?</p>
        <p>A. Most companies have become much more sensitive to the demands of their shareholders, and Procter is no exception. It had been viewed as a slow-moving, ponderous kind of company, and Wall Street was pushing for change.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, money managers have very short time horizons, and companies are judged on 3-month, 6-month and 12-month results, which are the same periods [on which] they themselves are judged.</p>
        <p>Given its size and sizable market shares, Procter faces a unique challenge. But in a perfect world you want to see the company continually raise the bar. They have resources others don't.</p>
        <p>If you are big it is hard to grow, but size gives them a remarkable ability to negotiate with their suppliers, which means they can keep costs lower than competitors. And they have more leverage with retailers, which should give them an ability to get new products on the market quicker than a small, untested company.</p>
        <p>Q. What sort of changes was Mr. Jager trying to effect? And what is going to survive?</p>
        <p>A. Among other things, the company's reporting structure was changed, and so were people's responsibilities and titles. At the same time, the organizational mind-set was being changed to be more risk-tolerant and fast-paced. I don't think they will undo the change in organizational structure. And while they might encourage a modest amount of risk-taking, they will be a little bit slower to implement it.</p>
        <p>Q. But hasn't Procter's performance been hindered by more than just the effort to change its culture?</p>
        <p>A. While you have all this internal movement, outside of the company raw-materials prices were rising and the euro was plummeting against the dollar. Also, its product categories are very mature. Under normal circumstances, those sorts of things would have been very hard to overcome.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you expect things to change with Mr. Lafley in charge?</p>
        <p>A. Given his history, I think Mr. Lafley will focus on Procter's core businesses and get out of things that are tangential. That means that on balance they would be less likely to acquire something than they were under Durk Jager. A bid for a food business like Nabisco, for example, would surprise me.</p>
        <p>Also, Mr. Lafley strikes me as someone who will be more like the Procter of old, someone who will make everyone feel more comfortable. Since Wall Street has a pretty short time horizon, that means the next couple of quarters will be tough for Procter.</p>
        <p>Q. What does the company need to do to get upward movement in its stock price?</p>
        <p>A. Procter has some issues that are unique to Procter, but the environment is a tough one for household products.</p>
        <p>Given the current earnings outlook, I think the stock is pretty fairly priced. But if Mr. Lafley can put together a credible plan, with objectives people think are realistic, that will help.</p>
        <p>I really hope they lower their revenue and earnings targets. Right now, I think they are stretch goals.</p>
        <p>Eleven percent growth in earnings is more realistic than their current estimates of 13 percent to 15 percent. And top-line growth of around 5 percent, while they are saying 6 percent to 7 percent, is a credible revenue number.</p>
        <p>Q. Are there any new products in the pipeline that have the potential to create lots of incremental growth?</p>
        <p>A. They have a lot of really interesting, technologically innovative new products. But Procter is a $40 billion company, and it needs a lot of them. There is not one that will move the dial for them. Branded companies are maintaining their market shares, but they are doing that in markets that aren't really growing. That is particularly true among industrialized countries.</p>
