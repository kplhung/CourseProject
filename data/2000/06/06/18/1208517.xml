        <p>FROM the tee down near the rocks of Carmel Bay, you can't see the chasm. All you see is the grassy horizon of the fairway with the dazzling expanse of Carmel's crescent beach to the right. Beyond the fairway at the edge of the chasm, out there about 260 yards, shaggy grass surrounds two small signs.</p>
        <p>''Danger,'' they warn in red. ''Steep cliff.''</p>
        <p>It's so steep that, according to Pebble Beach lore, a woman once tried to commit suicide there by jumping off that cliff. Somehow she suffered only a broken leg. Another time, the driver of a fairway mower, realizing he couldn't stop in time, jumped off the mower just before it plunged into the chasm.</p>
        <p>About 100 feet down at the bottom of the chasm, surf slaps against the rocks and slides up the sand. Across the chasm, five yawning bunkers and thick rough surround the sloping green of this 418-yard eighth hole at Pebble Beach, where Tiger Woods is about to win his first United States Open championship.</p>
        <p>After a par 71 that included a bogey at No. 8, Woods had a 10-stroke lead on Ernie Els going into today's final round.</p>
        <p>The eighth is not the most photographed hole at Pebble Beach, but it's the most precise hole, the most demanding, the most threatening.</p>
        <p>''Just the way the second shot sets up there,'' Jack Nicklaus said before this Open started, ''it's my favorite shot in golf.''</p>
        <p>Of all the shots that the best golfer in history has assessed, he calls this shot to the eighth green his favorite. Pebble Beach ought to plant a plaque with that rave review on it somewhere on the edge of the chasm with those two danger signs.</p>
        <p>But your tee shot must be as precise as that second shot over the chasm. Hit your tee shot too far and you don't have a second shot. If your ball is not down in the chasm, it is in the rough near one of those danger signs with nowhere for you to stand.</p>
        <p>In what the 60-year-old Nicklaus, the four-time champion, announced was his last Open round after a record 44 Opens, his tee shot there Friday went too far into that rough.</p>
        <p>''I hit a 3-wood off the tee and I cut it up in the wind a little bit to kill it, but it went too long by about a foot,'' he said after an 82. ''I took a drop, then I hit a 7-iron 20 feet short of the hole and it looked like it landed on a highway.''</p>
        <p>Nicklaus later agreed that his double-bogey 6 there just about finished his hope of making the 36-hole cut. But no matter which way the wind is blowing, that chasm creates a decision for every golfer as to what club to use on the tee.</p>
        <p>For Tom Kite, how he played the eighth hole in the final round of the 1992 Open probably made the difference in his winning.</p>
        <p>Kite, in a duel for the lead with Jeff Sluman, arrived at the eighth tee after a surprising birdie 2 on the 106-yard seventh hole when his wedge from the rough scooted across the green and into the cup. On the tee, pumped up by that birdie and with a wild wind at his back, Kite was fingering the 3-iron in his bag until his caddie, Mike Carrick, spoke up.</p>
        <p>''I like the 4,'' Carrick said.</p>
        <p>''You mean the 3,'' Kite suggested.</p>
        <p>''No, the 4,'' Carrick repeated.</p>
        <p>''How far is the cliff?''</p>
        <p>''Two-sixty,'' the caddie said.</p>
        <p>Kite paused, nodded, yanked the 4-iron and hit it. When he walked up the hill to the fairway, he saw his ball perched about 5 yards short of the cliff.</p>
        <p>''Nice call,'' Kite told his caddie.</p>
        <p>Had Kite hit the 3-iron, his ball would probably have disappeared into the chasm along with his opportunity to win what turned out to be his only major title. But with a par at the eighth, Kite went on to shoot 72 for a three-under-par 285, two strokes ahead of Sluman.</p>
        <p>The day before, Gil Morgan arrived at the eighth tee at 12 under for the tournament, the first golfer in Open history to be in double figures under par. After a good tee shot, Morgan's iron over the chasm flew into the back bunker. He flubbed his explosion shot, chipped long and two-putted for a double-bogey 6 on his way to a 77.</p>
        <p>With an 81 in the final round, Morgan skidded to a tie for 13th. The eighth hole had wrecked him.</p>
        <p>In the 1972 Open, Nicklaus had a par at the eighth in the windy final round and went on to win by three strokes. But in the 1982 Open, which Nicklaus lost by two strokes to Tom Watson, he had a costly bogey there after five consecutive birdies.</p>
        <p>''My second shot landed in what they called 'the character,' the rough that was this high,'' the Golden Bear recalled, pointing to his knees. ''I was only about 12 feet from the hole and I swung as hard as I could, but I barely got it out. Bogey.''</p>
        <p>Minutes later, Watson saved par at the eighth with an 8-foot putt. In the third round, Watson had birdied the eighth with a 4-wood and a 5-iron to about 18 feet.</p>
        <p>For better or for worse, something always seems to happen in the Open at Pebble Beach's eighth hole, where that chasm demands a precise tee shot. Far, but not too far. Not too close to either of those two danger signs and certainly not into the chasm.</p>
