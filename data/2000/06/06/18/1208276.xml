        <p>WHEN people talk, writers listen to what they are not talking about.</p>
        <p>William Mastrosimone's people are one step ahead. They talk about wanting to talk.</p>
        <p>In the first of eight vignettes, collectively called ''Blinding Light,'' at the Passage Theater here, Clair talks to an unseen man who is threatened by her unseen therapist.</p>
        <p>''We never talk,'' she says. ''Dinner, movie, sex; that's what our lives have become.''</p>
        <p>She adds: ''We could always do something novel. Like talk to one another.''</p>
        <p>Then there's Alicia, formerly Al. ''I thought we could talk,'' she says to her unseen mother, who doesn't want to hear about the sex-change operation her son had so he could become a lesbian.</p>
        <p>Alicia and Clair, if not all of Mr. Mastrosimone's other nine characters, fit into the category of misfit. He means to write of outsiders and castoffs, of desperation, of the ever-thwarted need to cut through truth blocks -- and talk.</p>
        <p>It is a handy symbol that the unreachable people Clair and Alicia are trying to talk to are also unseen. That's what makes a monologue. And Mr. Mastrosimone is investigating the word, extending its boundaries, allowing for silences and pauses, as if we are overhearing one part of a conversation.</p>
        <p>The director, Julie Boyd, and the actors Jenny Eakes and Scott Denny are very skillful in enabling us to become eavesdroppers, in eliminating the obvious impression that Clair and Alicia are just talking to themselves. And the playwright's talent for creating characters who are not there is vividly realized by the actors' responses.</p>
        <p>In the role-switching four member cast, Maggie Lacey is a zoned-out digital-age lawyer, prattling on about ''a mutually beneficial alliance,'' while trying vainly to get up close and personal in a pre-nuptial contract, until negotiations fail. She segues smoothly and poignantly to the role of an isolated janitor with a mop -- and a first encounter with lipstick.</p>
        <p>And Richard Topal effectively shifts from playing Mark, the other slick lawyer, to Rod, a modern-day caveman, alone with the bears in a forest, a terminally insecure predator of women. With Alicia and Rod, Mr. Mastrosimone explores the dark corners of mysterious human sexuality.</p>
        <p>In three scenes, two people interplay, adhering to the playwright's attempted theme of defensive, veiled relationships. In ''Romance in the Year of the Plague,'' the plague could be AIDS or cyberbabble.</p>
        <p>In ''Asteroid,'' a husband and wife, here pretentiously listed as He and She, fantasize about what could've, should've been, in twin soliloquies. It all starts with bickering over a cup of sugar, but of course, it isn't about sugar. Then come interior explosions. Each withdraws into what Tennessee Williams called ''something unspoken.'' Their mutual sense of trust betrayed is sad. Sadder still is the audience response to the scene as comedy. Presumably this is the one with more immediacy than the others and the laughter comes from tension. What can make a playwright happier than the talent for distilling unhappiness so precisely? Mr. Mastrosimone has hit home with this one.</p>
        <p>But he has not scored a home run, not with the structurally contrived ''Asteroid,'' which refers to an article She ripped out of the newspaper, and not in the collection, which is not altogether thematically true. The biggest strikeout is the title piece in which a couple's lifetime goes by in 20 minutes. That one starts on an airplane. Time flies, you know. The playlet is perhaps too slow by design in the beginning, that time of life when we think there is time enough. Later, after childbirth, it goes faster, speeding and whizzing through a surfeit of triteness.</p>
        <p>Given the economy of his concept, Mr. Mastrosimone, counterproductively and very oddly, overwrites and overexplains with buzzwords. Must Clair ask, ''What about our issues?'' and talk of discovering ''our common ground again''? Does Alicia really have to say, ''Why can't you be there for me?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mastrosimone's experimentation with form is ready for an essential next phase.</p>
