        <p>FIRING workers, like capital punishment, is applauded in America. Just the announcement of a mass downsizing in the mid-1990's would raise a company's stock price. Now that happens when a chief executive's head rolls. A faltering company seems somehow cleansed.</p>
        <p>We even have a self-appointed scorekeeper: Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, a Chicago firm that helps companies find new jobs for workers they lay off. As a sideline, Challenger in the 1990's began tracking layoff announcements and issuing grim monthly tallies. In the current robust economy, mass layoffs are way down and out of fashion. Shedding the chief executive is increasingly popular, and Challenger began last August to keep this new score.</p>
        <p>The total through last Thursday was 706 chiefs of publicly owned companies, an average of 15 a week. Some retired in the usual way or jumped to better jobs, but the vast majority were dismissed. Durk I. Jager's ouster from Procter &amp; Gamble on June 8 was departure No. 36 this month, and the toll  has since risen to 48.</p>
        <p>More formal studies confirm the trend. One found that 40 percent of new chief executives lose their jobs within 18 months. Another, by Rakesh Khurana at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that for the same poor performance, a chief executive was three times as likely to be fired in 1996 than in 1985.</p>
        <p>''We are asking them to pitch no-hitters every day,'' said John A. Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray. The game, in sum, rides entirely on the pitcher, not on the other players or on field-tested team strategies. As Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the Wharton School, put it: ''We are substituting people for strategy. Instead of working out plans and goals, directors look at another company that is doing what they think they want to do, and they hire an executive from that company and hope'' he will do the same for them.</p>
        <p>Failure is defined as two or three quarters in which profits fail to rise at a 15 percent annual rate, and the stock price fails to keep up with the expectations of the bull market. That was the background music for Mr. Jager's departure. Or a new chief executive fails to bring about a merger or reorganization. Four out of five directors expect their chief executives to lead in this direction, according to surveys by the National Association of Corporate Directors.</p>
        <p>Hold the tears, of course. Ordinary workers, even middle managers, are lucky if they walk away from a downsizing with enough in savings and severance to support their families for a year. The chief executives depart with enough not only for their families but their descendants for several generations. Knowing the high risk of being fired, they negotiate huge pay and severance packages, granted by the very directors who will later do the firing.</p>
        <p>Just 25 years ago, a typical American chief executive was deeply entrenched. His cronies dominated the board, his company made money despite its inefficiencies and he resisted change. The rise of corporate raiders and leveraged buyouts brought an end to such inertia, and the increasingly powerful financial markets took control of most boards; today, directors are more likely than not to speak for shareholders.</p>
        <p>A decade ago, if a big institutional shareholder like a pension or mutual fund did not like management, it sold the stock. Now it presses the board to drop the chief executive. Instead of being deeply rooted, the chief sways on a limb.</p>
        <p>Is that an improvement? Probably, said Mr. Cappelli -- provided that directors become more committed, participate in strategic planning and shift more management authority to lower levels. Above all, they must be patient, giving the chief executive time to carry out a strategy, even if profits and the stock price do not quickly respond. The Eaton Corporation behaved this way, according to Stephen R. Hardis, who will retire next month at 65 after five years as chief executive. ''My predecessor owned the board,'' he said. ''My board owned me. But they always gave me a lot of support.''</p>
        <p>New technologies and product innovation force companies today into constant, risky change. Eaton makes auto and truck parts and transmissions, and in the Hardis years, the product line was redesigned to add electronic controls. The process involved the kind of staff upheaval that might have brought down a chief elsewhere. ''You cannot change a company without changing people,'' Mr. Hardis said.</p>
        <p>He wonders, then, whether Mr. Jager, who led Procter &amp; Gamble for just 17 months, lacked skills, or the board lacked patience. ''When I read about Jager, I wondered if it would make other chief executives more risk averse,'' he said ''If you have to fundamentally reshape a business, it takes time, and makes people unhappy.''</p>
