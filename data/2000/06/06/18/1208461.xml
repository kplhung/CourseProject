        <p>More New York City schoolchildren -- especially middle school students - are meeting new higher standards in English Language Arts, according to figures released this month by the city's Board of Education.</p>
        <p>Across all city schools, 41 percent of students in grades 3 through 7 met the standards in city or state tests administered this year, an increase of 6 percentage points from the year before, when the city and state introduced new English tests.</p>
        <p>But the gains were far larger in middle schools: almost all schools showed improvement, and the average scores rose by more than 11 percentage points from tests given the year before.</p>
        <p>While the results were encouraging, the sweeping gains also raised questions about the reliability of the tests. Some testing experts attributed at least some of the gains to familarity with the new tests and better preparation for them.</p>
        <p>And city officials were hard pressed to demonstrate that any particular policy change caused the leap in scores in almost every seventh grade across the city. Even more perplexing was that fifth grade scores fell by four percentage points, at the same time scores in sixth and seventh grades rose.</p>
        <p>Testing officials said it might take several years of test results before they could say whether the gains were due to student improvement or technical issues involving the way the tests were designed or administered.</p>
        <p>This year, the Board of Education changed the way it reports the results, to match a new system introduced by the state. Instead of reporting the percentage of students at or above the typical American performance, the city reported the percentage of students who achieved each of four levels.</p>
        <p>On this page are scores for students at middle schools across the city, combining the results of the city tests with a similar state test administered to fourth graders in January. Here are the explanations of the categories:</p>
        <p>STUDENTS TESTED The number of middle school students tested, including special-education students. Results for schools with fewer than 20 students tested are not shown.</p>
        <p>INCOME Percentage of students who did not qualify for free school lunch, based on Federal income guidelines in 1999. The higher the number, the higher the income.</p>
        <p>RANK The city's middle schools were ranked from 1 (highest) to 249 (lowest) based ont he percentage of students meeting city and state standards as computed by The New York Times. Special-education schools are not included.</p>
        <p>PERFORMANCE LEVELS Percentage of middle school students in each category on the state's fourth-grade test (for those middle schools that have a fourth grade), and the city's test for students in third, fifth, sixth and seventh grades.</p>
        <p>Levels are ranked from 1 (lowest) to 4. Students at Levels 1 and 2 fall below performance standards. Those at Level 1 have serious deficiences, and those at Level 2 do not have full mastery of the standards. Students at Levels 3 and 4 meet or exceed the standards.</p>
        <p>PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE Shows the change in the percentage of students who scored at Level 3 or 4, compared with tests administered in spring 1999. Last year's scores were recalculated by the Board of Education to match the new reporting format.</p>
        <p>PERCENTAGE MEETING STANDARDS The black bar shows the percentage of students who scored at Level 3 or 4.</p>
        <p>NOTES District 85 schools have been taken over by the Chancellor for poor performance. District 78 schools are run byt he city's high school division, rather than community districts. Blanks indicate missing data. An asterisk after a school's name indicates taht it is administered by the Board of Education rather than a community school district, and that it is not included in a district's summary totals. Summary totals include only middle schools.</p>
