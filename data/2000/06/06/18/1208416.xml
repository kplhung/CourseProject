        <p>TO hear some in NATO talk, Montenegro is the unsinkable aircraft carrier in the West's unfinished war against Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic.

        <p>Montenegro is the last republic of Tito's Yugoslavia that remains alongside Serbia in Mr. Milosevic's incredible shrinking state. But Montenegro has barely more than 600,000 people -- a third of Belgrade's population -- and represents only 5 percent of Yugoslavia's people.</p>

        <p>TO hear some in NATO talk, Montenegro is the unsinkable aircraft carrier in the West's unfinished war against Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic. But last week, the carrier took a few shells from  Montenegro's voters, a sizable minority of whom want to remain inside Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>Montenegro is the last republic of Tito's Yugoslavia that remains alongside Serbia in Mr. Milosevic's incredible shrinking state. But Montenegro has barely more than 600,000 people -- a third of Belgrade's population -- and represents only 5 percent of Yugoslavia's people.</p>
        <p>Still, Milo Djukanovic, its young president, broke away from Mr. Milosevic and barely defeated a Milosevic ally in 1997. He has also moved sharply toward the West on a platform of virtual and then eventual independence from an undemocratic Belgrade. He opposed Mr. Milosevic's policies toward Kosovo and then defied him during the war there a year ago, raising fears that Montenegro could be the next flashpoint in Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>But now, an ambiguous election result has reduced the pressure for Montenegrin independence just when few in NATO have much taste for another confrontation with Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>In local elections last week in the capital, Podgorica, and in the seaside town of Herceg Novi, Montenegrins split over competing notions of the republic's future. A coalition called ''For Yugoslavia,'' which supported Mr. Milosevic, won a handy victory in Herceg Novi, while losing in Podgorica, where Mr. Djukanovic is strong.</p>
        <p>It's always easy to make too much of local elections, but the message to American policy makers was clear: Mr. Milosevic has won a round in fair elections.</p>
        <p>''Djukanovic clearly thought he'd get a better result, and he didn't,'' one senior American official said. ''It's not a disaster, but it's a signal.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Djukanovic and his coalition, it is a clear warning that any referendum on independence for Montenegro would not win by the kind of thumping majority that could prevent civil strife. In fact, it could produce civil war and partition.</p>
        <p>Even more important, these deep splits could allow Mr. Milosevic and Belgrade to foment civil strife in Montenegro with a high degree of deniability, even without a direct use of the Yugoslav military units that are based there. While the NATO alliance has not promised to come to Montenegro's aid if Belgrade moves forcibly against it, NATO leaders have warned Mr. Milosevic against doing so.</p>
        <p>Senior American officials insist that any effort to move against Mr. Djukanovic with force could have consequences in Belgrade, with new bombing attacks. But few in NATO want another bombing war after Kosovo. One senior NATO official said acerbically, ''Kosovo was such a resounding success that no one in the alliance wants to repeat it ever again.''</p>
        <p>So Mr. Djukanovic's awkward limbo continues, with him caught among competing pressures -- from some supporters to move more briskly toward independence, from Washington and NATO not to precipitate a crisis, and from Belgrade aimed at undermining him.</p>
        <p>Belgrade's pressure is not just political and psychological, Western and Montenegrin officials insist, but also physical, with the skillful assassination, 10 days before the vote, of one of Mr. Djukanovic's closest bodyguards. American  officials say they have no evidence of Belgrade's involvement. Still, the assassination seemed like a message to the Serbian political opposition, too -- one that was underscored by what appeared to be an assassination attempt on the Serbian opposition figure Vuk Draskovic late Thursday night in Montenegro.</p>
        <p>''The vote just puts Djukanovic further into the maze, trying to chart a middle course, but to where?'' said John Fox, a former State Department official who specializes in the Balkans. ''This limbo in which Montenegro is supposed to remain becomes more difficult and more costly for Djukanovic in political terms.''</p>
        <p>The most obvious loser in the election was the Liberal Alliance, which favors rapid independence and precipitated these elections by pulling out of a coalition with Mr. Djukanovic. But Mr. Djukanovic has also lost, because some significant part of the pro-Yugoslavia vote was an anti-Djukanovic protest against corruption and arrogance in this small state where, as in Belgrade, a few people live extremely well on their political and criminal connections. In small Herceg Novi, Mr. Djukanovic's brother, Aco, is a major figure, and he is widely disliked for his shady business practices.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Djukanovic matters to the West. He  has provided shelter to Serbian opposition figures who were afraid for their lives, both during the war and afterward, as well as to Serbian draft dodgers during the war. And he has provided a platform for broadcasting anti-Milosevic material into Serbia. In return, he has received Western adulation and millions of dollars in aid.</p>
        <p>A S a part of Yugoslavia, Montenegro can also have an impact on the fate of the country's president, Mr. Milosevic. That is why American officials -- and much of the Serbian opposition -- are pressing Mr. Djukanovic to take part in federal elections Mr. Milosevic must call by the end of this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Djukanovic has opposed the idea, rejecting  the legitimacy of the currently constituted federal government or Parliament. But the Americans and the Serbian opposition are convinced that they can win the elections if Montenegro participates, weakening Mr. Milosevic before next year's crucial parliamentary elections in Serbia. A Montenegrin boycott, on the other hand, could give Mr. Milosevic an excuse not to have the elections at all.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fox thinks the strategy is wrongheaded. Montenegro's participation would legitimize Mr. Milosevic more than undermine him, he says, and in any event the West should call the elections unfree and unfair, given the restrictions on the media in Serbia. ''The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is already illegitimate and dysfunctional,'' Mr. Fox said. ''And here we are saying to Djukanovic that we won't talk to the war criminal that heads it but that you have to participate in his election.''</p>
