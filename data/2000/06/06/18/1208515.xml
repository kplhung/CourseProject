        <p>John Van Wisse wanted to lie down. The 27-year-old swimming coach from Australia ached after four hours of swimming, his body shivering through the Hudson River. He saw his fellow Australian Bronwen Whitehead streaking ahead.</p>
        <p>He wanted to sleep. He wanted his father.</p>
        <p>Four hours later, Van Wisse was lying down, his eyes creeping closed. He had kept swimming, had won the 19th annual Manhattan Island Marathon Swim in his first attempt, finishing the 28.5 miles in 7 hours 53 minutes 48 seconds, three seconds ahead of the 21-year-old Whitehead.</p>
        <p>He still did not have his father, who died six months ago at 63. But he was trying to sleep.</p>
        <p>''John, stay with me,'' his sister Tammy said. She had won the marathon swim in 1997, but did not compete this year. She thought he had hypothermia, as in 1993 when he stopped breathing in the English Channel and started sinking before he was dragged out.</p>
        <p>''Keep talking,'' she whispered.</p>
        <p>He murmured something, and she started crying into his ear. He opened his eyes and smiled.</p>
        <p>''John said, 'All I could think about was Dad, and I just wanted to make him proud,' '' his sister said later. ''So I told him, 'Dad would have been proud.' ''</p>
        <p>Said John Van Wisse: ''It's a real thrill. My father taught me not to give in. He was very stubborn. He couldn't swim at all, but he was always for the family.''</p>
        <p>The Manhattan Island Marathon Swim is the longest annual swim marathon in the world, and the grueling conditions -- including water in the 60's, speedboats, the Circle Line and floating debris from broken piers -- take their toll. The record for the race is 5:45.25, set by Shelley Taylor-Smith in 1995.</p>
        <p>The race begins in the Hudson River at the tip of Battery Park, follows the tide up the East River, and returns down the Hudson to the same point.</p>
        <p>Swimmers staggered out of the water by the end, needing assistance to climb the ladder onto the pier at Battery Park, where the race began at 8:15 a.m.</p>
        <p>Whitehead needed to be carried up the ladder. And as she stood supported by several people, she took off her bathing cap, revealing a white band of skin above her blazing forehead.</p>
        <p>''I feel absolutely dead,'' she said later with a small smile. ''But it's such a satisfying feeling.''</p>
        <p>This year's race drew a record 35 swimmers from three countries, as well as two six-person relay teams. Twenty-nine swimmers finished.</p>
        <p>''Why would people want to climb Mount Everest?'' said the New Yorker Henry Eckstein, 52. ''It's dangerous, painful, you might die. It's a challenge.''</p>
        <p>This was his second straight island swim, following months of training six days a week. He finished yesterday in 21st place at 9:03:58.</p>
        <p>The challenge drew 26 first-time island swimmers, including 24-year-old Jeanne Coon, a graphic designer from Morristown, N.J.</p>
        <p>She arrived early yesterday and listened to the Beastie Boys to calm herself and distracted herself by trying to remember lyrics while she swam. Before the race, her mouth was turned down, her eyes wide. She was not sure she could do it.</p>
        <p>But Coon finished, in 9:45.11. She was the last swimmer from the water.</p>
        <p>''It's such an achievement when you pull it off,'' John Van Wisse said. ''You discover things about yourself.''</p>
        <p>As Jack Thomas, the third-place finisher and the first American, at 7:56:34, looked on, Van Wisse stood to collect his winner's cup. He tottered forward and lifted it above his head.</p>
        <p>''I got knocked around,'' he said. ''But we're all in the same boat.''</p>
        <p>Or river.</p>
