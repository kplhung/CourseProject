        <p>Choice dry ros'es, as light as summer's air currents, are garden parties in a bottle. Their watercolor palettes -- pink, cherry, coral, salmon -- and delicate flavors lift the spirit and tickle the appetite. Today, the breed, defamed by white zinfandel, is redeemed by Spanish rosado.</p>
        <p>Navarra, in the north, has become synonymous with stylish rosado, like the '99 Vega Sindoa from Bodegas Nekeas. A sweet grenache-cabernet bouquet yields to a dry, tangy collage of miniaturized fruity flavors. Pour the wine with flounder, chicken, veal, ham or salmon.</p>

        <p>Choice dry ros'es, as light as summer's air currents, are garden parties in a bottle. Their watercolor palettes -- pink, cherry, coral, salmon -- and delicate flavors lift the spirit and tickle the appetite. Today, the breed, defamed by white zinfandel, is redeemed by Spanish rosado.</p>
        <p>Navarra, in the north, has become synonymous with stylish rosado, like the '99 Vega Sindoa from Bodegas Nekeas. A sweet grenache-cabernet bouquet yields to a dry, tangy collage of miniaturized fruity flavors. Pour the wine with flounder, chicken, veal, ham or salmon.</p>
        <p>Francophiles may relish the '99 Chateau Routas Rouvi'ere ros'e, an almost austere grenache-syrah-cinsault blend that alluringly whispers the Provencal accents of its obscure Coteaux Varois appellation.</p>
        <p>The '99 Wolffer dry ros'e from the fashionable Sagpond Vineyards in Sagaponack, on the South Fork of Long Island, is a tailgate-picnic favorite at the Hamptons Classic horse show.</p>
        <p>Drink these wines young; if you ice them long, it's vinicide. Pour them marginally cool, swish them aerobically in your mouth for fully 45 seconds and watch them become Salomes.</p>
        <p>In Manhattan, Vega Sindoa is $7 at Baccus, 1375 First Avenue (74th Street), and $8 at Grande Harvest, opposite Track 17 in Grand Central Terminal.</p>
        <p>The Routas costs $10 at Manley's, 35 Eighth Avenue (12th Street) and $10 at Direct Cellars.com, 160 Chambers Street (Greenwich Street).</p>
        <p>The Wolffer is $9 at Acker Merrall &amp; Condit, 160 West 72d Street (Broadway), and $10 at the Windsor Wine Shop, 474 Third Avenue (33d Street).</p>
