        <p>SUN, sand and seafood mean summer on Long Island. For nearly 40 years, Steve's Pier One has been part of that good-times equation. Generations have flocked to the Bayville beach-side landmark to savor lobsters, enjoy spectacular sunsets on the Sound and gawk at the marine memorabilia. The place oozes with stuffed fish, ship's lamps, anchors and ship's models.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, the restaurant changed hands and the new owners are gradually dropping Steve from the name. The two cavernous dining rooms are still labeled the King George and Queen Elizabeth rooms for Steve Karathanos's parents, but the ancestral portraits no longer grace the lobby.</p>

        <p>SUN, sand and seafood mean summer on Long Island. For nearly 40 years, Steve's Pier One has been part of that good-times equation. Generations have flocked to the Bayville beach-side landmark to savor lobsters, enjoy spectacular sunsets on the Sound and gawk at the marine memorabilia. The place oozes with stuffed fish, ship's lamps, anchors and ship's models.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, the restaurant changed hands and the new owners are gradually dropping Steve from the name. The two cavernous dining rooms are still labeled the King George and Queen Elizabeth rooms for Steve Karathanos's parents, but the ancestral portraits no longer grace the lobby.</p>
        <p>My memories of Steve's Pier One, a bit faint from a distance of more than 20 years, are of the bridge over the lobby pool (the death-row holding tank for lobsters and crabs) to a large, sprawling seafood spot with sky-high prices and earth-bound food. It hasn't changed.</p>
        <p>Walls of windows provide sensational water views. An outdoor terrace, overlooking the beach, is a perfect perch for pre-dinner drinks. But diners interested in deftly prepared seafood will find it done better elsewhere for less money.</p>
        <p>The stars of the menu are those inmates from the lobby pool. Lobsters go for about $20 a pound. The steamed twin one-pounders we tried were fine. Even better were the Dungeness crabs ($42.95), two split jumbos that gave up sweet, juicy meat.</p>
        <p>But things like aerosol whipped cream on commercial desserts, foil-wrapped baked potatoes (which end up being steamed) and butter served in little plastic, foil-lidded tubs are not the hallmarks of a quality spot. They are all present at Pier One.</p>
        <p>Service is leisurely and, depending on the luck of the draw, ranges from attentive to clueless. One evening, our waitress had no idea who had ordered what and failed to recite about half of the specials.</p>
        <p>Busboys do a good job, though, and immediately deliver bread, butter and a varying assortment of mushrooms a la Greque, lightly blanched carrot slices and rough-cut, creamy coleslaw. The spunky mushrooms are for serious garlic lovers only.</p>
        <p>Neither of the chowders, Manhattan or New England, passed muster.  The former was a peppery vegetable soup with just one very chewy clam in it. The bland bisque was chunkier than the name implies and overloaded with potatoes. The Pier One salad is also ordinary: a small glass bowl of greens, cherry tomatoes and sliced vegetables with a choice of dressings.</p>
        <p>The more simple the better is the rule to follow when choosing an appetizer. Oysters on the half shell were sparkling. Also earning high marks was the shrimp cocktail of five jumbos fanned on a bed of ice. Large, plump mussels cooked in white wine were pleasing, but steamers were too gritty to be enjoyable. Skip the lobster cocktail (a special at $15.95). It was small, tasteless and rubbery. A complicated dish called king crab rolls was another miss: a tasty seafood filling encircled with tough phyllo pastry.</p>
        <p>Two fish specials illustrate the restaurant's hit-and-miss record. Mahi-mahi in a white wine sauce was overcooked and dry, while Chilean sea bass with fresh tomatoes and capers was a perfectly turned out delight. Snapper in a gutsy tomato sauce loaded with peppers, olives and capers was also a hit.</p>
        <p>But say no to the dry, tough T-bone, a travesty at $28.95, and to the crab-meat ravioli, a blah dish with a mushy, could-be-anything filling. Flame-roasted sea scallops were numerous, but many had a metallic taste. ''Every once in awhile I get a sweet one,'' said the diner who ordered them. Soft-shell crabs suffered a similar fate. Three of the four were O.K.; one tasted strong and old.</p>
        <p>Most of the desserts are made elsewhere and are not worth the calories. The cheesecake and Key lime pie were the best of the lot. A house-made apple-custard crumb pie was tasteless and had a burned crust.</p>
