        <p>Christopher Nixon Cox letter responds to Steven R Weisman's June 11 Editorial Observer column that linked Richard M Nixon's narrow loss in 1960 presidential election to his 'proud refusal' to ask Pres Dwight D Eisenhower to campaign for him; asserts Mamie Eisenhower intervened to urge Nixon not to make such a request so as not to put strain on Eisenhower's health</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Steven R. Weisman (Editorial Observer, June 11) cites as a factor in Richard M. Nixon's narrow loss in the 1960 presidential election his ''proud refusal'' to ask President Dwight D. Eisenhower to campaign for him.</p>
        <p>In fact, Nixon wanted Eisenhower to campaign and would have asked him but for an emotional phone call by Mamie Eisenhower to Pat Nixon, in which Mrs. Eisenhower implored her to persuade Nixon not to ask the president to campaign with the caveat that ''Ike must never know I called you.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Steven R. Weisman (Editorial Observer, June 11) cites as a factor in Richard M. Nixon's narrow loss in the 1960 presidential election his ''proud refusal'' to ask President Dwight D. Eisenhower to campaign for him.</p>
        <p>In fact, Nixon wanted Eisenhower to campaign and would have asked him but for an emotional phone call by Mamie Eisenhower to Pat Nixon, in which Mrs. Eisenhower implored her to persuade Nixon not to ask the president to campaign with the caveat that ''Ike must never know I called you.''</p>
        <p>This account from Nixon's papers is confirmed by my mother, Tricia Nixon, who was present when Mrs. Eisenhower called my grandmother to tell her that Eisenhower's heart was not up to the strain of campaigning.</p>
        <p>Looking for reasons for Nixon's loss in 1960, Mr. Weisman might search economic history, which shows that Americans lost 800,000 jobs during an economic contraction that started in April 1960 and ended in December 1960 and which had a strong effect on an electorate with fresh memories of the deep 1958 recession.</p>
