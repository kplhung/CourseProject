        <p>During the late 1980's and the early 1990's, when protests in Tompkins Square Park were common, a popular rallying cry was ''The park belongs to the people!'' Now some park users are again uttering those words. But the issue is not opposition to a curfew or the displacement of the homeless. Their target is a new program sponsored by the East Village Parks Conservancy that dedicates trees in the park in return for donations of up to $4,000.</p>
        <p>The conservancy defends the program on the grounds that the money raised is sorely needed to pay for services they say the Parks Department cannot provide, like treating diseases and pruning.</p>
        <p>Under the program, trees can be dedicated at costs ranging from $2,000 to $4,000. The names of people to whom trees are dedicated appear on brass plaques fixed to the Parks Department building at the north end of Tompkins Square.</p>
        <p>On June 3, the first tree to be dedicated was named in honor of Allen Ginsberg. A ceremony in the park included statements by Ginsberg's longtime secretary, Bob Rosenthal, and several poets.</p>
        <p>The event also included remarks not on the agenda. Fran Luck, a longtime activist and an East Village resident for 30 years, showed up to berate the conservancy for honoring an advocate of free speech in Tompkins Square while trying to exert control over the park. Ms. Luck later distributed leaflets demanding, among other things, the commemoration of a former homeless encampment in the park known as tent city, and an end to the use of workfare recipients to clean the park.</p>
        <p>The East Village Parks Conservancy was formed in 1995. It is run with the New York City Partnership for Parks, a division of the Parks Department. The private, nonprofit group organizes volunteers to spread mulch, pull weeds and give tours of the park.</p>
        <p>Jane Sturtevant, a member of the conservancy's tree committee, said her group was interested only in taking care of Tompkins Square Park, not in taking it over.</p>
        <p>''She didn't do her homework,'' Ms. Sturtevant said of Ms. Luck. ''We are not trying to privatize the park.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Luck remained unpersuaded. ''The conservancy is a private, self-appointed group,'' she said. ''They don't own the trees, so who are they to be auctioning them off?''</p>
