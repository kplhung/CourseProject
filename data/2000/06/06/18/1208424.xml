        <p>Taking the place of the former B. Smith's soul-food restaurant space in the theater district is Jack Rose, which opened May 15 at 771 Eighth Avenue, at the corner of 47th Street. The restaurant is named after a man who, according to legend, was a Hell's Kitchen gangster back in the 1910's who inspired a drink of the same name. Its combination of applejack, lemon juice and grenadine has been reworked by the restaurant to be a little easier on the throat.</p>
        <p>The restaurant's specialty is steak: a New York sirloin costs $28.50, and an eight-ounce filet mignon $24.95. Like B. Smith's, which moved last fall to 320 West 46th Street, the restaurant is owned by the Ark Restaurant Corporation and has the same chef, Henry Chung. There is seating for 300 people on two floors that include a dining area, a bar and an area on the upper level for private parties.</p>

        <p>The interior has a gas-burning fireplace set in stone along one wall, and walnut sculptures made to simulate trees that enclose the main dining area.</p>
        <p>''It's masculine yet inviting,'' said the general manager, Christine Mundy.</p>
