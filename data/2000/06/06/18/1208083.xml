        <p>THE EXECUTIONER'S DAUGHTER</p>
        <p>By Laura E. Williams.</p>
        <p>Holt, $15.95.</p>
        <p>(Ages 12 and up)</p>
        <p>This is no ''Executioner's Song'' -- it's more of a bizarre jingle, both lightweight and gruesome. Laura E. Williams's novel is set in medieval Europe, just as ''Xena: Warrior Princess'' is set in the ancient Mediterranean, but minus the humor. It is the story of Lily, a young girl who must first face her fate and then decide whether to accept it. Will she become her gruff, alcoholic father's assistant when her kindhearted, ever-loving mother is taken by a fever, or will she break free and become the healer she has always dreamed of being?</p>
        <p>Everyone says ''aye'' and '' 'tis'' a lot, but beyond some obviously researched details there is little in the way of historical accuracy in this book. A girl would rarely have been made anyone's apprentice, and I'd wager a tankard of ale not one was ever called upon to assist an executioner.</p>
        <p>Lily has never been allowed to participate in a medieval Take Our Daughters to Work Day, so she has trouble fully appreciating the true horror of what her father does for a living. She thinks all executions must be just and her father's work honorable, even though the neighborhood children call her names and throw rotten eggs at her, and visitors seeking herbal remedies come knocking only in the dead of night, when no one will see them.</p>
        <p>When it is her turn to step up to the plate, her father's ax pitches a blood-spurting head at her feet and she runs screaming for the hills. If you thought this might be the opportunity for an exploration of the morality of capital punishment, you would be half right: Lily realizes that sometimes the death penalty, as in the case of a poacher, might be overkill, and she is repelled by the townsfolks' cruelty and blood lust, but the fundamental question of whether it is ever just for the state to take a life is never raised.</p>
        <p>Besides the rolling head and the dying mother, we are treated to boys stabbing a bunny rabbit with pointed sticks, a wounded hedgehog with a stump for a foot, and the bloody, infected, mutilated arm of a thief who had his hand cut off. Lily seems to learn that if you truly love something, sometimes you must let it go and throw rocks at it to make it stay away; if you won't, maybe you never loved it in the first place. This seems to apply equally to mended foxes and daughters. Aye.</p>
