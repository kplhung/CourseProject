        <p>WHEN Bonnie Reece answered the phone, I told her I wanted to speak to her husband about his former student who now was running for president.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''No, George Bush.''</p>
        <p>''He didn't teach George Bush,'' she corrected me. ''He taught Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>When he returned my call, Jim Reece, a professor of accounting and operations management at the University of Michigan Business School, explained that Mr. Gore was a student in his calculus class in the 1964-65 academic year at the St. Albans School in Washington. Yes, he later taught at Harvard Business School, Mr. Reece said, but George W. Bush had never been in his class. Still, he agreed to check his files and call me back.</p>
        <p>Fifteen minutes later, Mr. Reece acknowledged that he might be the only teacher to have taught the presidential candidates of both major parties. He had found Mr. Bush's class card and photograph, with a few notes in the margins; they helped jog his memory. ''I remember George being a very friendly guy,'' he said, ''and a good student.'' The class was an introduction to management accounting.</p>
        <p>In part, he better remembered teaching Mr. Gore because his St. Albans class had only 13 students, versus 84 in Mr. Bush's section. Also, it was Mr. Reece's rookie year as a teacher. ''You never forget your first year in the classroom,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even before finding out about his unusual predicament, he was undecided about how he would vote in November. But Mr. Reece, accustomed to giving job recommendations for his students to prospective employers, was willing to provide this reference to the American people: ''Based on my experience teaching them, I don't have any qualms about either being president.''</p>
