        <p>FOR some, Father's Day is a time for tacky ties and sugary cards. For the woman telling her story on a day of scorching sun, it will be a time to ponder questions of family and affinity that most people never confront.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, when she was 30 and in the afterglow of first-time motherhood, she learned that the woman she thought was her mother was really her mother's half-sister. And the man she had believed was her father was not biologically related to her at all.</p>
        <p>Her mother, it turned out, was a beloved aunt. It was she who abruptly revealed the secret. The other piece fell into place two weeks ago after the woman's husband tracked down her biological father. He was an old boyfriend of her aunt and a family friend she vaguely remembered. This Father's Day, she may meet him for the first time as an adult.</p>
        <p>''I'm a little nervous,'' she said. ''It's been hard. The whole process has been hard.''</p>
        <p>The woman telling the story, a teacher who lives in Manhattan, does not want her name used. There have been too many years of secrets and tears on all sides. As difficult as it was to hear that she was not who she thought she was, even harder perhaps has been renegotiating relationships.</p>
        <p>She grew up as an only child, but suddenly she has five half-siblings. And a biological father who she says seems closer to her in spirit, at least on the telephone, than the man who raised her. That relationship, which she says has been difficult for years, has been strained further by her decision to forge a relationship with her biological father.</p>
        <p>What is important, she says, is that she finally knows the truth about her heritage, which seems a basic right.</p>
        <p>''I have four parents and my child has six grandparents,'' she said. ''The people who raised me will always be my parents, but it has been important for me to know where I really come from.''</p>
        <p>The question of what constitutes family and what a child needs to know about his or her origins is ascendant in this time of wrangling over open adoption, the rights of grandparents and technologically assisted pregnancies.</p>
        <p>''When you lie about stuff like this, you're telling lies that shape a person's life,'' the  woman said. ''When I found out I was adopted, everything made so much more sense to me.''</p>
        <p>The short version of her story is that her biological mother was 18 and her father 19 when her mother became pregnant. Marriage and parenthood did not seem a good option for two students with ambitions beyond raising a family (he would have had to drop out of West Point). The couple's parents decided that adoption was best.</p>
        <p>But the young mother could not bear to let her baby go. Instead she took her daughter to live with her sister and brother-in-law, who were childless after two miscarriages.</p>
        <p>Again, the families put their heads together and decided that the new baby would become the daughter the childless couple never had. She was never formally adopted, and no one ever hinted at her true parentage.</p>
        <p>Still, until she was 12 she saw a lot of her biological mother, whom she knew as her aunt. Then her ''aunt'' married a doctor and moved to the Midwest. They stayed in regular contact. As for her biological father, he took a keen interest in her for a time, buying her presents and asking about her welfare. Then he, too, married and disappeared.</p>
        <p>The woman's relationship with her adopted parents, meanwhile, was testy. She was a free-spirited, artistic child who loved to explore. They were sober and conservative. They seemed angry that she was not an extension of them, she said. But she knows that many parents feel that way when their offspring turn out to be unlike them.</p>
        <p>Her aunt told her the truth during a visit to New York in 1998.</p>
        <p>''We were sitting in the living room, next to each other, and my husband was remarking on how much we looked alike and how much we were alike in voice and gestures,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''I made a joke of it. I said, 'You know, we are related.' She said, 'Yeah, I'm your mother.' ''</p>
        <p>The woman confronted her adoptive parents about the deception. Her mother, she said, was weepy, her father furious. Her mother seemed relieved that she knew, the woman said, but had not wanted to be the one to tell her. Her father insisted that she belonged to him and that it was a secret he had intended to take to the grave.</p>
        <p>For her part, she is angry that she was lied to, but knowing the truth about her origins makes it easier to understand and forgive her adoptive parents.</p>
        <p>Best of all, she likes what she knows of her biological father, who apologized for not trying harder to keep her. They have talked on the telephone every night for the last two weeks, catching up on the past, having an extended father-daughter blind date.</p>
        <p>''He's funny, he's charming, he's got a great voice,'' she said. ''It's like I've known him all my life.''</p>
