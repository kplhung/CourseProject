        <p>SINCE the funk band Deep Banana Blackout plays more than 200 dates a year outside its home state of Connecticut, performing at the Gathering of the Vibes next weekend will be sort of a busman's holiday. The annual celebration of music, arts, crafts and family fun takes place Friday through Sunday at Seaside Park in Bridgeport.</p>
        <p>''Yes, it's great to play the Vibes because all our friends can make it,'' said the lead guitarist, Fuzz, an original member of the Bridgeport-based group. ''It's also great to play with so many excellent bands.''</p>

        <p>SINCE the funk band Deep Banana Blackout plays more than 200 dates a year outside its home state of Connecticut, performing at the Gathering of the Vibes next weekend will be sort of a busman's holiday. The annual celebration of music, arts, crafts and family fun takes place Friday through Sunday at Seaside Park in Bridgeport.</p>
        <p>''Yes, it's great to play the Vibes because all our friends can make it,'' said the lead guitarist, Fuzz, an original member of the Bridgeport-based group. ''It's also great to play with so many excellent bands.''</p>
        <p>The Festival of the Vibes, which is presented by Terrapin Tapes, a Brookfield-based distributor of blank audio media, features such nationally popular acts as Ratdog (with the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir), the bluegrass musician David Grisman and his quintet, the jazz innovator John Scofield and the Southern rocker Warren Haynes. Les Claypool, the bassist for Primus, will offer the debut of his new project, the Rat Brigade.</p>
        <p>The roster also includes Original P, Moe, Strangefolk, Percy Hill, Walter (Wolfman) Washington and the Roadmasters, Merl Saunders and Friends, Max Creek, Soulive, Zen Tricksters, Tony Trischka, Sonia Dada, Sector 9, Harlem Gospel Choir and Schleigho.</p>
        <p>''The Gathering of the Vibes started as an opportunity for a unique niche community to dance and hang out with friends,'' said Ken Hays, Terrapin's executive director. That niche, he explained, was a jam band in the spirit of the Grateful Dead. The Gathering of the Vibes, now in its fifth year, started soon after Jerry Garcia died. ''The festival has become sort of a big summer reunion.''</p>
        <p>''We've been playing the Vibes since 1997, which is when our first CD came out,'' said Fuzz, referring to ''Live in the Thousand Islands.'' ''Rowdy Duty,'' the band's double, live CD recorded in one night at 7 Willow Street in Port Chester, followed last year.</p>
        <p>The band (its Web site can be visited at www.deepbananablackout.com) consists of Fuzz on guitar and vocals, the singer Jennifer Durkin, Rob Somerville on tenor and soprano saxophone and vocals, Rob Volo on trombone, guitar and vocals, Benj LeFevre on bass, Cyrus Madan on organ, Johnny Durkin on percussion and Eric Kalb on drums.</p>
        <p>Last year's festival, the first held at Seaside Park, drew more than 8,500 fans daily. Mr. Hays said he hoped to round off that number at 10,000. For a rising band like Deep Banana Blackout, which has been together since 1995, it means performing for as many people in one weekend as it does at 80 club dates.</p>
        <p>''It's such a blast, playing for such a large, fun crowd,'' said Fuzz, whose band will back Merl Saunders on Friday evening. ''And, best of all, right in our backyard.''</p>
        <p>Tickets for Gathering of the Vibes -- Friday, Saturday and next Sunday in Seaside Park, Bridgeport -- range from $35 to $75. Children 12 and under are free. Camping is available. Patrons are encouraged to bring nonperishable goods for the Connecticut Food Bank in East Haven. The number to call for information and directions is (800) 677-8650. The event's Web site can be found at www.gatheringofthevibes.com.</p>
