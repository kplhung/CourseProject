        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Where Boys Can Learn to Shape Up'' by Laura Leivick [May 28] brought back memories. In the mid-50's, Marnie Cooper, a former Balanchine dancer, arrived at the University of Montana to teach ballet to football players. The theater department asked that she also teach a class for theater majors. The wife of the dean of music took home movies of our single performance, and a copy of the film was sent to Mr. B to show him what Ms. Cooper was doing out West. Evidently Mr. Balanchine took a look, for soon a letter arrived asking Ms. Cooper to ''send the tall boy,'' indicating me, to New York as a scholarship student.</p>

        <p>''Where Boys Can Learn to Shape Up'' by Laura Leivick [May 28] brought back memories. In the mid-50's, Marnie Cooper, a former Balanchine dancer, arrived at the University of Montana to teach ballet to football players. The theater department asked that she also teach a class for theater majors. The wife of the dean of music took home movies of our single performance, and a copy of the film was sent to Mr. B to show him what Ms. Cooper was doing out West.

        <p>It was hell. New York was quite different from Missoula, Mont. I was thrown into classes suitable for my age but not my training. I never did really understand why those Russian teachers in black were prodding me with their canes and talking to me in French. There was no counseling, no one to teach an 18-year-old novice any rudiments of ballet tradition, no single person I could ask for help or information. The majority of the boys probably envied my 6-foot-4-inch height but were not at all friendly to a newcomer from the wild West. I lived in a furnished room in the West 70's and walked across the park to the East Side each day for class. I spent free time at the New York Public Library reading about ballet. I had little recreational contact with any of the other students and, since most of each day was spent in class, knew almost no one outside of the school.</p>
        <p>Several of the company's reigning ballerinas were intrigued with me, and would occasionally come to a partnering class, stand next to me on point, smile up at me and urge me to ''keep at it.'' I remember that to be my only encouragement other than knowing that I was doing pretty well in class. The elderly Russian teachers continued to whack me with canes and talk in French. I only lasted a year; the hard work, difficult living situations and most of all the petty harassment from the other boys finally wore me down.</p>
        <p>How things have changed for men at the School of American Ballet! Hats off to Peter Martins and Kay Mazzo. How encouraging to know that there is a structure and young men are being nurtured and encouraged.</p>
