        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mr. Kozol's indictment of the structural inequality within the city's public school system is powerful. What will happen to the students of Morris High School when the new Regents standards are fully in place? How many of the 65 (out of 1,200) will graduate then? At the City University, where I work, the board of trustees has repeatedly asserted that when the Regents standards are in place, we will no longer have to concern ourselves with remediation, that the quality of students who come to CUNY will markedly improve.</p>

        <p>Mr. Kozol's indictment of the structural inequality within the city's public school system is powerful. What will happen to the students of Morris High School when the new Regents standards are fully in place? How many of the 65 (out of 1,200) will graduate then? At the City University, where I work, the board of trustees has repeatedly asserted that when the Regents standards are in place, we will no longer have to concern ourselves with remediation, that the quality of students who come to CUNY will markedly improve.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kozol's essay reminds us that without a commitment to support all of our schools -- yes, that includes money -- standards will not be met by magic and students will not achieve. Words are empty. Deeds count. It's easy to erect barriers to CUNY, harder to help students succeed.</p>
