        <p>AN abundance of new construction is an indisputable fact of life in Westchester. To some, it's a sign of prosperity and growth; to others, the development comes at a destructive price.</p>
        <p>Lynn Butler takes the latter position and for 20 years, she has taken pictures of Westchester's changing landscape -- primarily from horseback. In a recent interview, she talked about her work.</p>
        <p>Q. In 1988, you published your first book, ''A Passage Through the Land of Sleepy Hollow'' (Glover Press). As you explain it, the book, which includes your photographs and text, focuses on Westchester's dwindling supply of undeveloped land like farmlands and nature preserves. How did this idea come about?</p>
        <p>A. I had been riding horses through Rockefeller Park Preserve in Pocantico Hills for some time, when I noticed how the area around the park had begun to be developed. Then, when I saw my own shadow on the ground, atop my horse, I began to think about the Headless Horseman in Washington Irving's book, ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.'' I began to imagine how my horse could have a fantastical, spiritual connection to the horse of Ichabod Crane, as if Crane's horse, Knickerbocker, could send his thoughts to me, through my horse.</p>
        <p>Then it all came together. I thought if I could show the area's natural beauty, people might pay more attention to the down side of the so-called land development.</p>
        <p>Q. In a way, your horse is your co-conspirator in this mission. How did that relationship come about?</p>
        <p>A. From the early 1980's to the time of his death in 1994, my horse, Job, literally affected the outcome of my photographs. Using a slow shutter speed, I took photographs as I rode him. His movements effectively changed the resulting photography by how, and how fast, he moved. He even knew to hold still when I was loading and unloading the camera -- in fact, it got to a point where I no longer needed to use the reins.</p>
        <p>Q. Why photography? Why not prose, music or painting?</p>
        <p>A. Actually, I studied violin at Juilliard, but I was too shy to feel comfortable performing in public. The camera gave me a chance to observe something, allowing me to separate myself from the audience. I started out as a documentary photographer, working for magazines like Newsweek and Life.</p>
        <p>Q.  You mentioned your concern for the environment with respect to toxic dumping. Can you elaborate on that?</p>
        <p>A. First of all, my father was a doctor, an oncologist. His cancer research made me thoroughly aware of the hazards of environmental pollution. It is difficult for me to overlook what we are doing to our planet, and inevitably to ourselves. For instance, what at first might appear as benign, such as one of our many golf courses, can actually be harmful without proper precautions with respect to drainage. Just the run-off alone from the chemical pesticides used to maintain the grass can pollute our streams, rivers and our ground water.</p>
        <p>Q. You also mentioned that the farmhouse you once lived in was situated at a hotly contested site for development. Is that still the case?</p>
        <p>A. That 19th-century farmhouse still stands in Briarcliff Manor. The property, which surrounds the land of the house, some 75 acres, abuts both the Chernick Bird Sanctuary and Swan Lake, which is part of the Rockefeller Park Preserve. That land has been slated for development by two successive developers. Currently, it is designated as wetlands, and the impact studies, so far, have prevented any development. Unfortunately, the current owner of the property is determined to develop the land, which will disturb the wetlands and destroy the bird sanctuary.</p>
        <p>Q. What are you working on now?</p>
        <p>A. My current project is a book called ''Flames Against the Dark -- Saving America's Endangered Sacred Sites.'' Frank Joseph has written the text, which will accompany my photographs. The book centers around the birth of a white buffalo calf in Wisconsin. The Lakota tribe believes this to be a sign from Mother Earth, signifying a time for all of the planet's different races to work together to restore, replenish and strengthen the earth.</p>
        <p>Ms. Butler's photographs may be seen at the Leica Gallery, at 670 Broadway at Bond Street, in Manhattan. The number to call for information at the gallery is (212) 777-3051. Ms. Butler's second book, which includes more images of Westchester, is ''Imperiled Landscapes, Endangered Legends'' (Universe Publishing, 1997).</p>
