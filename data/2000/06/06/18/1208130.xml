        <p>Anger is already a leitmotif in this year's presidential campaign. In April, George W. Bush vowed to ''end the arms race of anger'' in American politics and called for a return to comity in the public conversation. Al Gore's handlers, meanwhile, have been trying to make him more huggable. In New York, Mayor Giuliani has molted his cutworm skin and emerged as the Love Bug. But here's what comity gets you: that picture of Hillary Clinton and Rick Lazio stiffly shaking each other's hands with transparently insincere smiles as brittle as frost.</p>
        <p>Americans have long been uncomfortable with displays of anger from their public servants. Senior journalists still tend to referee politics according to what might be called the Smithereens Infraction. Presidential candidates in particular dare not betray the slightest hint of being short-tempered, lest this pique be perceived as the kind of hotheaded instability that might bring the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation -- or, nowadays, Nasdaq to its knees.</p>
        <p>I'm not sure that the reflexive distrust of anger serves politics well now. The Republicans are talking about making their convention a vitriol-free zone this summer, even trotting out a rehabilitated John McCain. But his participation will serve only as a reminder of the kind of healthy political anger that Bush's victory managed to quell. Back in February, conceding to Bush after the South Carolina primary, McCain was mad. With barely contained indignation, he condemned Bush's winning strategy -- the below-the-belt questioning of his military valor, the relentless attack ads, the courtship of the religious right. On CNN, Jeff Greenfield and Judy Woodruf wagged their fingers at McCain's outburst -- and his temper, not what prompted it, became the story. Bush wiped the mud off his hands and, his party's nomination safely in possession, suddenly became the king of comity.</p>
        <p>We could use more anger, not less, in the campaign. Not the kind of anger recently forsworn by Mayor Giuliani -- the aggressive, mean-spirited, egocentric kind fired by self-interest -- but the kind that cuts through the Muzak of politics-by-focus-group and causes voters to believe that a candidate might actually believe in something larger than the latest in-house poll. High-minded anger can be a great rhetorical tool, precisely because it is genuine, passionate and often unscripted. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ''I Have a Dream'' speech is one of the masterpieces of 20th-century oratory because of the smoldering indignation that warms every word. The defining failure of Bill Clinton's presidency is that his most public expression of anger in nearly eight years in office did not serve to galvanize public sentiment on poverty or health care or racial injustice. The full-throated fury of the man's political soul was directed at ''that woman.'' His rage got our attention, but it did so in the service not of an idea but of his own reputation.</p>
        <p>That's the problem. In these self-absorbed times, no one in politics gets publicly angry about anything larger than his or her ambitions. Oh, there's plenty of anger afoot in the culture at large. Each of us boils over in response to insults of breathtaking triviality: being put on hold, getting cut off by a motorist, waiting for a table at a restaurant. Little incivilities produce enormous hemorrhages of bile, which may explain our simultaneous horror and fascination on those rare occasions when a politician does let loose. Our sense of outrage has become so self-centered, so circumscribed, so small that our collective social anger has itself become small-minded, and we've lost the ability to hear righteous anger for what it can be -- a principled recalibration of society's moral compass. In learning to distrust and discourage political anger, we have delegitimized the things that should make us angry. Today, there is no righteous anger, only self-righteous anger, which is always easy to dismiss.</p>
        <p>Hence, our current politics of small-minded vitriol, with its undermining negativity, its huge economies of energy devoted to stalemate and sinecure. When I lived in Italy, it was commonplace (as it still is) to make fun of the operatic parade of dysfunctional Italian governments. The truth is, we have effectively adopted all the salient principles of Italian politics -- the art of obstruction, the rhetoric of obfuscation, the elevation of self-interest above public interest, all with the oily, insincere veneer of comity. The coming anger-free election season promises more of the same, and if recent trends are any predictor, voters will stay away in droves.</p>
