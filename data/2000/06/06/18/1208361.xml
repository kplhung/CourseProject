        <p>THE private ''sky box'' at ESPN Zone had its own waiters, several television monitors broadcasting a press conference by Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers and a spread of hors d'oeuvres. Still, Vicky Bullett, Murriel Page and Nikki McCray seemed bored by it all.</p>
        <p>The women, all members of the Washington Mystics, one of the leading teams in the W.N.B.A., hadn't come to eat fried chicken fingers or to watch Mr. Bryant feign modesty. They were there, on the evening before their Tuesday game against the New York Liberty, to play.</p>
        <p>''Let's go upstairs,'' said Ms. Bullett, 32, a 6-foot-3 power forward who has a reputation for rowdiness among her teammates. ''I'll show you all how it's done.''</p>
        <p>Bounding out of the elevator at the top-floor video sports arcade, they immediately jumped onto snowboard simulators. The ride was familiar to them because the ESPN Zone in Washington is where they hang out after home games. ''I love this one because I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing,'' said Ms. McCray, 26, a 5-foot-11 guard pretty enough to model and poised even as she bobbed and weaved.</p>
        <p>After half an hour of riding simulated Harley-Davidsons and thoroughbreds and driving simulated Formula One racers (they passed the free-throw area without so much as a glance), they were ready to depart for the main event -- the American Foundation for AIDS Research benefit at the Central Park boathouse. They conceded right away why they were going. ''We're looking for famous people,'' Ms. Bullett declared. The one they were most hoping to see was Monica Lewinsky, whom they seemed to root for like a home town underdog.</p>
        <p>In the town car (a tight squeeze of long slender limbs) they gossiped about other players' weight gains and looked out the windows longingly at the stores. ''Donna Karan,'' Ms. Page said. ''I need some of that.''</p>
        <p>At the entrance to the boathouse, there was a gaggle of photographers and a red carpet. The players switched into celebrity-spotting mode, giraffing their necks above the crowd. When one of the organizers of the event asked if they would pose for a photograph, the women seemed shocked that they themselves were considered celebrities. ''You want us?'' Ms. Bullett asked.</p>
        <p>The first celebrity they glimpsed once inside was Donald J. Trump. The players introduced themselves and shook his hand. ''He's got big bucks,'' Ms. Bullett said afterward. ''I wanted to ask him to help the league, but I didn't have the nerve.''</p>
        <p>The players made their way to the V.I.P. area, picking up plates of food from the tables that had been set up by many of the city's most stylish restaurants. All around, ingenue models and actresses like Angie Harmon swooshed by in decollete cocktail dresses. The players, dressed in casual slacks and tops, fretted that they were underdressed. ''I should have worn my capri pants and heels,'' Ms. Page said.</p>
        <p>Back on the celebrity trail, Ms. Bullett spied Sandra Bernhard (well, she didn't actually recognize her by name, but she was sure it was someone). It was growing near their self-imposed 9:30 p.m. curfew when they saw Ms. Lewinsky across the room.  ''We need to talk to her,'' she said breathlessly to her teammates. ''We need to tell her that Bill comes to our games in his sneakers. We need to tell her that he looks fine.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lewinsky made her way toward the waving teammates and stood for a photo. They didn't say a word to her about ''Bill,'' but just stood and grinned. ''Us with Monica,'' Ms. Bullett said. ''Now I can die and go to heaven.''</p>
