        <p>As his anger rose against the waves of illegal immigrants crossing the border onto his cattle ranch, Joe Harris decided not to carry his gun anymore. He feared losing control and shooting someone, causing an international incident. Even so, he wonders now how much more he can stand.</p>
        <p>''Things are getting very tense down here,'' Mr. Harris said, pointing to hideouts on his ranch that illegal immigrants had used to elude the United States Border Patrol. ''The ranchers here are tired of nothing being done about it. We're tired of the garbage they leave. We're tired of them tearing down our fences. We're tired of losing cattle. We're tired of losing our way of life.''</p>
        <p>With new law enforcement resources making other crossing points along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico harder to penetrate, the rugged area around Douglas, a town of 15,000 people just north of Agua Prieta, Mexico, has come under siege by desperate migrants seeking illegal entry into the United States in hopes of finding jobs in cities as far away as Chicago and New York.</p>
        <p>After federal agencies bolstered security at once popular crossing points like those at San Diego and El Paso, hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants, many of them with children, began flooding the Douglas area two years ago, risking inhospitable desert conditions, including poisonous snakes and daytime temperatures of well above 100 degrees.</p>
        <p>But lately, they have encountered another threat: angry ranchers on the outskirts of Douglas who have grown so weary of border crossers tramping across their land in groups of 50 and more that some, taking matters into their own hands, have detained the migrants at gunpoint until Border Patrol agents arrived.</p>
        <p>While the number of these ranchers is small, perhaps fewer than a half-dozen, and only one migrant has been injured by gunfire since Douglas has grown so popular, the ranchers' actions have drawn complaints from the Mexican government and organizations in Arizona that say the ranchers are violating the border crossers' human rights.</p>
        <p>Even the rancher who the authorities say has been the most aggressive in confronting the migrants, Roger Barnett, says a serious incident is inevitable if the government does not do more to stem the northward flow of illegal immigrants.</p>
        <p>''It's going to happen, with me or somebody else,'' said Mr. Barnett, who has used weapons to detain several thousand illegal immigrants on his 22,000-acre ranch in the last two years. 'I'm just sick and tired of all this. I don't want them crossing my place. If the government was serious, they'd bring in the U.S. Army. We're getting invaded.''</p>
        <p>Government officials, however, say the Border Patrol is making giant strides in the border battle. With more money each year from Congress, the agency has been able to use its expanding force and new technology, like night-vision cameras, to help catch some border crossers and discourage others. Those caught -- an estimated one of every three who cross -- are interviewed and fingerprinted, then sent back to Mexico, a process that takes only a few hours.</p>
        <p>But historical patterns show that the successful cutoff of illegal immigration in one region pushes border crossers into areas of less resistance. As the number of illegal immigrants caught by the Border Patrol in the San Diego area fell to 182,267 from 524,231 over five years through last year, for example, border crossers discovered that the Douglas area was an easier entry point. The 12-foot walls adjacent to the customs checkpoint at Agua Pietra extend only a short distance, and the Border Patrol had only a handful of agents and little equipment.</p>
        <p>In addition, Agua Pietra, a city of more than 100,000, is large enough to accommodate migrants arriving from all over Mexico and beyond, including some from Europe and Asia, as they wait for the elusive ''guides'' the American authorities regard as criminal smugglers to lead them into the United States. Guides are known to charge $1,000 and more per person to lead border crossings, and they risk arrest and prosecution if caught.</p>
        <p>In the 1998 fiscal year, the 280-mile stretch of Arizona border known as the Tucson Sector, which includes Douglas, overtook San Diego as the busiest sector of illegal entry on the southern border, with 387,406 apprehensions. The total grew to 470,449 in the 1999 fiscal year  -- more than twice the number of five years before.</p>
        <p>In each year, more than 40 percent of the apprehensions occurred along the 28 miles of border flanking Douglas.</p>
        <p>''It was terrible down here,'' said Carlos X. Carrillo, assistant chief patrol agent for the Douglas station. ''Every night, local residents would be awakened at 1, 2, 3 o'clock in the morning by people jumping their fences, using their lawn hoses to wash, hiding on their roofs, knocking on their doors to ask for food and water. They were all over the place.''</p>
        <p>The shift from San Diego and El Paso and other entry points caused not only Douglas to change. Agua Pietra itself took on a new vibrancy as the border city adjusted to the  arrival of an increasing number of travelers intent on breaching the United States border.</p>
        <p>Busy streets near the customs checkpoint suddenly filled with pay telephones that Miguel Escobar Valdez, the Mexican consul in Douglas, said crossers used to ask relatives for money while they waited to make connections for entry into the United States. Also, small ''guest houses'' began opening to accommodate migrants, charging them the equivalent of a few dollars a night.</p>
        <p>A receptionist at the Hotel Villa del Rey, a tiny building several blocks from the border that opened four months ago, said ''the vast majority'' of the six rooms were filled with people waiting to cross into the United States. Mr. Escobar said as many as 400 such places are now operating in Agua Pietra.</p>
        <p>Many crossers cannot even afford the guest houses. Juan Marquez Garcia, a 28-year-old mechanic from Chihuahua, a city 300 miles away by bus, said he had been living in parks for nearly a month, trying to enter the United States to find work, only to get caught six times by American border agents. Now broke, except for a bag of empty soda cans to cash in for a few pesos, he said he planned to return to Chihuahua when he could raise $11 for bus fare.</p>
        <p>Officials in the United States say people like Mr. Marquez prove that their security strategies in the Douglas area are beginning to work, as statistics for recent months show. Apprehensions in the Douglas area are beginning to fall. By adding resources and extending the border walls several miles on each side of town, Border Patrol officials say they are taking back control of the region, especially in town.</p>
        <p>But just as increased security efforts elsewhere shifted patterns of illegal migration to Douglas, these patterns have more recently shifted again to desert regions beyond the extended walls, where flimsy barbed-wire fencing separates the two countries. As the Border Patrol waits for additional resources that arrive each month, crossers have plotted courses increasingly distant from Douglas and the highways they use for traveling north.</p>
        <p>In these areas are the private ranches where crossers hide until they make connections, arranged by their guides, for transportation to northern cities, or they get caught.</p>
        <p>Often, the immigrants hide for days at a time, and ranchers complain that they destroy water tanks for cattle, pipelines and fences. ''Fixing them has become part of our way of life,'' Mr. Harris said. ''Ranching is hard enough without doing all that.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes the immigrants grow so weary, scared or hungry that they initiate contact with the ranchers. Mr. Harris, who keeps a rifle by his front door, recalled a Mexican couple reaching his house one morning three months ago, asking for water and use of a telephone.</p>
        <p>''Their guide had stranded them, telling them a ride would be along in a few minutes to take them to Phoenix,'' he said. ''Since then, they had been living for two days in a culvert down the road with no food. When they showed up here, all they had was a Mexican can of Coca-Cola.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris insisted he felt compassion for people who wanted nothing more than a better life. But he and other ranchers said they believed that the United States government encouraged illegal immigration by failing to take more decisive action against companies that hire migrants.</p>
        <p>Mayor Raymond A. Borane of Douglas, who favors a new ''guest worker program'' that would allow illegal immigrants to work legally in this country, said the current economic boom in some measure stems from the immigrants taking jobs that Americans did not want.</p>
        <p>''They are helping drive our economy,'' Mr. Harris said. ''And the money they send home helps the Mexican economy.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Escobar, the consul, said illegal immigrants from Mexico in the United States had been sending back $6 billion a year, an amount that represents the third-leading source of foreign revenue in Mexico, behind tourism and oil.</p>
        <p>So it is not in the interest of either government to clamp down, Mr. Borane said, expressing an opinion shared by ranchers in the area.</p>
        <p>But that is not so, said Doris M. Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who cited the North American Free Trade Agreement as an example of efforts to bring Mexico's economy and living standards closer in line with those of the United States. She also said government agencies did what they could to pursue employers who hired illegal workers, using criminal and administrative remedies where possible.</p>
        <p>Describing efforts along the border as ''a work in progress,'' Ms. Meissner said the trade agreement ''should and will help both countries, but in a 10-  20-  30-year time frame, not 1, 2 or 3.''</p>
        <p>''By regulating the border,'' she added, ''we're buying time.''</p>
        <p>For now, though, that does little to appease people like Mr. Harris, who said he feared that ranchers bearing arms and angry attitudes could do nothing more than drive the problem somewhere else.</p>
        <p>Surveying a sea of old clothes, used water jugs and emptied cans of refried beans, he shrugged. ''I don't wish this on anybody,'' he said. ''But I'd rather see the government solve the problem right here, right now. Otherwise, it only goes to another Joe Harris down the road.''</p>
