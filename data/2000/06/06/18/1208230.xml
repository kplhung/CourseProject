        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In the excerpt from her new book, ''Command Performance: An Actress in the Theater of Politics,'' that appeared in Arts &amp; Leisure [''Art Versus Politics,'' June 4], Jane Alexander bemoans the Philistines in Congress who only pay attention to people who can give them money.  She encourages campaign finance reform and applauds political action committees for the arts.</p>
        <p>The problem with this approach is that after you have devoted all that effort and energy at wringing some bucks from the public purse, you will still be beholden to the Philistines for what they like and do not like. That will mean more begging and wheedling down the road.</p>

        <p>Why not instead devote all that energy and effort into making great art that inspires, moves, educates and uplifts? There is a great deal more money to be earned by pleasing those who fill the seats of symphonies and stand in awe at galleries than by pleasing those who walk the halls of Congress.</p>
