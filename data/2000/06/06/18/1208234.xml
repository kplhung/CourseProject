        <p>BY studying pantomime in her native city of Prague, Lenka Pichlikova skirted the language barrier that would hinder her acting career once she immigrated to the United States. Now, 20 years later, though she speaks fluent English, she still prefers storytelling through mime and dance.</p>

        <p>BY studying pantomime in her native city of Prague, Lenka Pichlikova skirted the language barrier that would hinder her acting career once she immigrated to the United States. Now, 20 years later, though she speaks fluent English, she still prefers storytelling through mime and dance.</p>
        <p>''It's the universal language,'' said Ms. Pichlikova, the adapter-director of ''Medea,'' which will be performed by her Modern Mime and Performance Company. The 65-minute production, in which Ms. Pichlikova also plays the title role, will take place on the stage of Stamford Theater Works Thursday through Saturday at 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>''It is an ambitious project,'' she said before a recent rehearsal with the eight-member cast in which dramatic tradition, she said, is being blended with a modern approach. ''I think love, hate, jealousy, despair can be very well expressed in movement. Mime was an important part of Greek and Roman drama.''</p>
        <p>''Medea'' is the ancient Greek drama by Euripides about the quintessential dysfunctional family. Medea is the scorned woman who steals the golden fleece with her husband, Jason, kills their two children and the woman who steals her husband, among other things.</p>
        <p>''The subject of ''Medea'' is interesting, even horrifying, in its own right, powerful and mysterious,'' Ms. Pichlikova said. ''I think ''Medea'' is, to a very great extent, about lost love.''</p>
        <p>One reason Ms. Pichlikova said she was drawn to ''Medea'' is that the title character is, like her, an exile. Before leaving her native country, Ms. Pichlikova said she had a dozen featured roles in Czech and German films as well as more than 40 roles in television. She trained at Charles University in Prague, where she learned circus skills and studied voice as well as movement and mine. She married an American and moved to New York, then Texas and finally to Stamford 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pichlikova said she started working on ''Medea'' while taking a class at the University of Texas in Dallas. She had one workshop production of her adaptation, which she has since drastically rewritten.</p>
        <p>''I decided to add a great many new elements, such as Medea's healing and rejuvenating powers and her use of magic to protect her beloved Jason,'' she said. ''I am having Medea go from birth to youth to maturity, including the births of her own children, to despair and rejection, and also aging and madness.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Pichlikova achieves this in part through blacklight. The device, with roots in Czechoslovakia going back to the 30's, uses ultraviolet light to make props and costumes glow brightly against a black background. ''I use the blacklight sequences exclusively to express the dark side of Medea, including her black magic,'' she said. ''Blacklight developed in part out of Japanese bunraku theater in which master puppeteers dressed in black manipulate nearly life-sized puppets. In some ways, it is like a live animated cartoon, but it can address weighty dramatic subjects as well as comic ones. It all looks very simple, but each stage movement is terribly complex, requiring sometimes several people dressed in black to help the visible actors.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Pichlikova also uses masks and video to express Medea's thoughts. ''When she is mad, the video image is distorted,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As theatrical as the production may be, Ms. Pichlikova is confident that the audience will relate the ancient tale to their lives. ''This story shows how innocent people, including children, are damaged by the miscommunications, ambitions and passions that are so typically human,'' she said. ''It's the innocent children who pay for the grownups' mistakes.''</p>
        <p>''Medea'' will be presented Thursday through Saturday at 6 p.m. at Stamford Theater Works, Sacred Heart Academy, 200 Strawberry Hill Avenue, Stamford. (203) 348-2919. Tickets are $15, $10 for seniors and students.</p>
