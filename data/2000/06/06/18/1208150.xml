        <p>ARCHITECTS are Freudian figures in a Marxian landscape. This was one clear message that emerged from the final ANY conference, a three-day architectural talent fest held earlier this month at the Guggenheim Museum. To get their work done, architects must operate in an environment increasingly ruled by market values. And this Darwinian backdrop heightens the peculiarities of the creative life. Architects, many of the best ones, are isolated individuals who are driven to construct social spaces. Their work displays the public virtues of their personal defects.</p>
        <p>Organized with great dedication by the writer and editor Cynthia Davidson, the ANY conferences were held each year starting in 1991. (The countdown-to-the-millennium format was intentional.) Some of the world's most gifted architects participated, including Arata Isozaki, Peter Eisenman, Rem Koolhaas, Jean Nouvel, Zaha Hadid, Ben van Berkel and Carolyn Bos, Elizabeth Diller, Rafael Moneo and Jacques Herzog. Joining the architects was an equally stellar cast of critics, philosophers and scholars, many of them influenced by the work of Jacques Derrida and other philosophers of the French post-structuralist school. In addition to Mr. Derrida himself, the list of writers and academics included Beatriz Colomina, Mark C. Taylor, Sanford Kwinter, Rosalind Krauss, Jeffrey Kipnis, Paul Virilio, Fredric Jameson, Anthony Vidler, Sylvia Lavin and Saskia Sassen.</p>
        <p>I attended only the last of the conferences, so I can't give a full account of the entire cavalcade. But most journalists who cover architecture knew about ANY. I once got a call from a publicist who said she was doing promotional work for it. I remember thinking, isn't that redundant? So mean! In fact, the published proceedings of the ANY conferences provide an unparalleled record of architecture's fragmented state at the close of the 20th century. As the new wave of pixels, superstrings and chaos crashed down on our crumbling bricks and mortar world, ANY held at least a muddled idea of architecture aloft.</p>
        <p>The conferences grew out of a moment when post-structuralist philosophy was at its peak of influence in American academic studies. After infiltrating art and literature departments, post-structuralist theorists began to consolidate their position in architecture schools. To them, architecture was the most challenging field post-structuralism could take on. Unlike fiction, fine art and popular culture, architecture offered theorists an opportunity to tear open the organization of society in real-life, everyday space. To others, the rise of theory looked like one more case of architecture coming late to the party. Any party.</p>
        <p>The name ANY originated as an acronym for Architecture/New York, though this year's conference was the first to be held in our fair city. Each conference bore a different title, from which that year's event ostensibly took its theme. Thus Anyone (convened in Los Angeles in 1991) begat Anywhere (Yufuin, Japan, 1992) begat Anyway (Barcelona, 1993) and so on down the nonsense chain of Derridean wordplay through -place,  -wise, -body, -how, -time, -more and -thing.</p>
        <p>A lot of meaning came packed into that baby-talk nonchalance. ''ANY'' carried a connotation of openness, for example (though this meaning was fiercely contradicted by the exclusivity of the events). It also suggested a desire to avoid creating intellectual hierarchies (also contradicted, in typical post-structuralist form, by raising post-structuralism itself to a privileged pinnacle). There were also less benign interpretations: an infatuation with the random and arbitrary; a desire to hedge bets; a refusal to commit to any point of view except negation.</p>
        <p>ANY's goal, so far as an outsider could discern one, was to establish architecture on a so-called ''discourse-based model.'' That is, the project aimed to make design subject to the intellectual rigor ostensibly demanded in the practice of philosophy. For many, such an enterprise was doomed from the start. After all, the rigor of post-structuralist thought had never been clearly established. Even if that were not in doubt, ANY would have been a quixotic undertaking, at least in the eyes of those who consider architecture an art. Art and philosophy are counter-propositions. They are different modes of apprehension. To say that art embodies ideas is not to suggest that artists should illustrate them.</p>
        <p>Detractors found it easy to dismiss ANY on other grounds as well: the conference represented architecture's succumbing to intellectual fashion. Its participants were using philosophy as a marketing tool. Its exclusivity was just a high-brow version of architecture's accelerating withdrawal from the public realm. It was too obedient to Peter Eisenman, Ms. Davidson's husband, an architect who has long relied on philosophy to give his architecture an aura of prestige.</p>
        <p>One must, I think, acknowledge the partial truth of these objections to get at what was valuable about ANY. It created at least a few shreds of solidarity among architects who would otherwise remain spinning in their separate spheres. It helped to retrieve architecture from the historical trash can to which the post-modern movement had gleefully consigned it. It exposed architects to potentially useful tools of cultural analysis. It helped to sustain the belief that, even in a relativistic universe, it is still possible to discriminate.</p>
        <p>For me, ANY was an incentive to carry on with a mid-life course in the history of ideas. Starting out in the mid-1980's with the standard post-structuralist reading list (Lyotard, Deleuze, Derrida, Foucault, Lacan), I found my way to more sympathetic writers (Benjamin, Barthes, Rorty, Jameson, Murdoch, Bloom), and these led me back, in turn, to Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, Plato and other contributors to the Western canon.</p>
        <p>As a result, I grew more confident in the value of criticism, more convinced that the difference between informed and uninformed opinion is a distinction worth pressing. Unfashionable concepts like morality became more accessible, provided I had the wit to construct plausible contexts for them. No one needed ANY to read philosophy, of course. But Ms. Davidson provided the incentive of immediacy. If architects today are philosophically up on their toes, that is partly because of the paces she put them through.</p>
        <p>Since I'm not a post-structuralist, I have no trouble ''privileging'' one point of view -- mine -- above others at this particular moment. In my view, the main task of architecture today is to mediate between our inner and outer worlds. It is an art of redefining boundaries, of articulating thresholds, bridges, edges, borders and passages. It is an art of transitions -- from one place to another, one time to another, one mind to another, between subjective perception and objective reality, private and public space, and between different ecosystems. This is why I found it gratifying that Rem Koolhaas was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize for the year 2000 late last month. The prize honored an individual, of course, but it also honored an idea, a transitional way of thinking about architecture that others have come to share.</p>
        <p>ON the final day of the ANY conference, Mr. Koolhaas presented two recent projects: a new headquarters for Universal City in Los Angeles and a quartet of Prada stores. Both projects address the question of corporate image. This is something Mr. Koolhaas knows quite a lot about. For many who have yet to see his buildings, the architect has himself become an icon. And his particular iconography states that he's a high-brow architect who yearns to tackle low-brow projects: the thinking person's Jon Jerde.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Koolhaas, shopping represents a reality principle, but of a particular kind. It signifies the bottom-line economics that govern the material world, the historical transition of the developed countries from production to distribution and the marketing apparatus that entices people to buy. But Mr. Koolhaas is part of the apparatus. He designs mental landscapes for shoppers who find themselves welcoming an invasion of images.</p>
        <p>The modern aesthetic was theoretically objective. It evoked the rational mechanics of technology and industrial production. A Koolhaas design may employ modern forms and materials -- glass, grids, sculptural abstraction -- but does not organize these elements into a neutral, functionalist container. There are subjectivisms along the way. Floors morph into ramps, spirals into squares; escalators expand space as if through a camera lens. Reason is contorted by desire. We seem always to be slipping through some porous membrane, back and forth between semipublic and semiprivate space, as if no fixed boundaries divide environment from self.</p>
        <p>All architecture stimulates desire, to the extent that it is able to receive or revise our projected ideals of beauty, and some may find Mr. Koolhaas's fascination with shopping a crude commercialization of those ideals. But he can't be accused of ignoring objective realities.</p>
        <p>At the ANY conference, one had to settle for individual presentations like Mr. Koolhaas's. There was almost no discussion among the participants, or with the audience. But the frozen tableaus of panelists was a presentation in itself. The awkward body language, the sullen refusal to catch the ball, or even toss one, made for an arresting picture: a group of allegorized city-states arrayed across a map. Each city-state had its own ambitions, resources and views of the world. Few showed any interest in the outlooks of others.</p>
        <p>This is why the most Utopian moment at the conference occurred when Mr. Koolhaas spoke about his intention to collaborate with other strong-willed architects, like Herzog and de Meuron, the Swiss team with whom he is currently designing a hotel in New York for Ian Schrager. Frankly, I don't know whether teaming up like this can be made to work. But it does seem to me the most provocative step architecture could take at this time. How else can the inmates hope to take over the asylum?</p>
