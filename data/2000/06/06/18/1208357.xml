        <p>Assemblyman Scott Stringer campaigned for the renovation of the 72nd Street subway station. He won, but now he worries about the effects of the resulting construction on local streets.</p>
        <p>''What I fought for was to have a renovated subway station built safely,'' Mr. Stringer said. To ensure that, he wants to form a special task force to block commercial traffic from nearby numbered streets and West End Avenue, where such traffic is forbidden.</p>
        <p>''You can't use the renovation as an excuse not to protect the people in the community,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stringer fears that drivers of commercial vehicles will be tempted to use those streets once lanes on Broadway are closed for the subway construction, which is due to start tomorrow.</p>
        <p>His biggest worry is the chance of an accident like the one last month in which a 71-year-old man was killed by a tour bus that was turning from Ninth Avenue onto 45th Street, where it was not allowed.</p>
        <p>Mark Patterson, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation, said the southbound lanes of Broadway between 72nd and 73rd Streets would be the ones affected by the work. He declined to discuss the impact of the construction on traffic, saying the project belonged to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p>
        <p>But Al O'Leary, an M.T.A. spokesman said: ''Traffic management is a D.O.T. function. It's not what we do.'' There are other construction projects in the area, he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stringer says congestion in the area is an old problem. Since 1996, he has conducted three surveys of traffic on West End Avenue. His latest study found that at least 578 commercial vehicles used the road during a seven-day period in February.</p>
        <p>That research and a May 21 anti-commercial-traffic rally resulted in a temporary increase in police enforcement, but Mr. Stringer is skeptical about lasting results.</p>
        <p>''The real question is, is there going to be improvement 90 days from now,'' he said. ''That's the litmus test.''</p>
