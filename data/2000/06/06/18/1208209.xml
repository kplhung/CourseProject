        <p>HE has handled the full-court press, the game-on-the-line final shot and even the college recruiting-letter blitz.</p>
        <p>But Ben Gordon, who has seen just about every pressure imaginable since he stepped on a basketball court, will face a new one starting this Wednesday: the full-clock telephone attack.</p>
        <p>According to the regulations of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, Wednesday is the first day that college recruiters can telephone a prospect heading into his final year of high school. And when it comes to college basketball prospects, no list of the top 10 in the nation would be complete without a mention of Gordon, the 6-foot-1 junior guard who averaged 24.6 points while leading Mount Vernon High to a 28-0 season and a state championship.</p>
        <p>Gordon has already weathered the onslaught of letters. Coaches, assistant coaches and recruiters from all over became pen pals, wanting to be his friend and sell the advantages of their institutions of higher learning. Seton Hall, Duke, Kentucky, George Washington and others, all courting a point guard they think could be a part of the national championship puzzle. Some write once, some write every day. Some Gordon even reads. The rest are neatly stacked in boxes by Evonne Gordon, in case her son wishes to read them later.</p>
        <p>Now the courting intensifies. ''That's going to be trouble,'' Gordon said recently. But he has a plan.</p>
        <p>''What I'm going to do is set aside time for them to call when I'll be in the house,'' he said.  ''I'm not going to let it take control of me.''</p>
        <p>It has been Gordon who has taken control, almost since those fifth-grade days when he fell in love with basketball at an after-school program and started dribbling a ball the block from his house to school each day.</p>
        <p>Bob Cimmino, who has been the head coach at Mount Vernon for six years, said, ''He just understands the game better than anyone I've ever coached.''</p>
        <p>His assistant, Al Visconti, added: ''There's just an instinct about him. He makes the right play all the time.''</p>
        <p>It is more, Visconti said, than just Gordon's ''real intelligence on the floor.''</p>
        <p>''The obvious thing is all kinds of physical ability,'' the assistant coach said. ''But from a coaching aspect, he has a real passion for the game. And he's a very good student, too.</p>
        <p>''I had him in class, and Ben's really a critical thinker. Some kids get by by memorizing. He's got a passion for learning.''</p>
        <p>But on a basketball court, the young man rival coaches call ''The Jordan of our league'' seems to be the teacher.</p>
        <p>''He's a pleasure to watch on court, like a surgeon,'' Visconti said. ''He's almost impossible to cover -- he's so quick and has such elevation. On a high school level, he can just dominate. He's the whole package.''</p>
        <p>Cimmino is still awed by one such domination. ''We were playing the defending state champions, White Plains, early this past season,'' he said, ''and we were losing after the first quarter. Ben had no points, and an elbow had given him a cut below his eyes, which was bleeding pretty badly. Our trainer fixed him up, just like with a boxer, during a timeout, and Ben went back out there.</p>
        <p>''He was mad. He scored 41 points in the last three quarters, and we beat them by 14. Ben totally took the game over.''</p>
        <p>Howie Garfinkel, the director of the Five Star Basketball Camp for promising young athletes in the sport, knows the nation's high school talent as well as anyone, and he agrees with the Mount Vernon coaches' superlatives.</p>
        <p>''He'll start right away in any college program,'' said Garfinkel, who has had Gordon in his camp twice and expects him back for a third year. ''An exceptional shooter. He's as good as anyone in the country -- I haven't seen the whole country, but there can't be anyone much better.''</p>
        <p>Gordon is good enough to have represented the United States in international competition, having interrupted his schoolwork to lead an American schoolboy all-star team to a third-place finish in the Albert Schweitzer Games in Germany at the end of April. He averaged 11 points in seven games and stepped up with a 14-point effort in the semifinals during a losing effort against Greece.</p>
        <p>''It was something to represent your country,'' he said. ''A special feeling.''</p>
        <p>Special and Gordon often seem to occupy the same sentence.</p>
        <p>''He's special even when he's not at his best,''  Visconti said. ''In the state championship, which we won in overtime, he didn't play particularly well but still got 30 points. And afterward he apologized to Coach Cimmino, saying the game was closer than it had to be because of him.''</p>
        <p>He still got the tournament's most valuable player trophy. ''And when he did,'' Visconti said, ''he turned and gave it to Greg Jenkins, our 6-8 senior whose tap-in had sent the game into overtime. 'Here, you deserve this,' he said to Greg.''</p>
        <p>Gordon may give away trophies, but he is not giving any hints on his college leanings.</p>
        <p>''I'm interested in all the schools recruiting me,'' he said last week. ''I'm just wide open. I don't really have a No. 1, or a top 5, or anything like that.''</p>
        <p>Let the calls begin.</p>
