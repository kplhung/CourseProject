        <p>They both plan for it and plant for it now, those hardy gardeners of State Street, between Hoyt and Bond Streets in Brooklyn's Boerum Hill.

        <p>They both plan for it and plant for it now, those hardy gardeners of State Street, between Hoyt and Bond Streets in Brooklyn's Boerum Hill. After winning the title of the Greenest Block in Brooklyn for two years running, the block was hit by a roving pack of plant thieves last year. The problems, unfortunately, are continuing.</p>
        <p>Kristen Austin, co-chairwoman of the block's beautification group, said recently pinched plants included a boxwood taken straight out of a container and common impatiens. The leafy larceny continues: ''We've had honeysuckle, coleus, honeysuckle fuchsia and double begonias'' stolen Ms. Austin said. ''We have had double impatiens, even succulents.''</p>
        <p>The number of plants taken is down a bit from last year, she said, as other blocks of the street have also begun putting in gardens.</p>
        <p>The gardeners have not reported their problems to the police this year, but are trying to plant less showy, less expensive plants in vulnerable areas, and yes, more thorny plants like holly and barberry bushes. They tie down their containers and wire their evergreens to buried stones or bricks. They buy cayenne pepper to ward off the four-footed thieves -- squirrels.</p>
        <p>''You put so much heart and energy and thought -- never mind money -- into the  planting, so to have one plant stolen is disheartening,'' Ms. Austin said. But a gardener's native optimism is hard to overcome. ''The benefits of our gardening efforts so far outweigh the disadvantages that we really don't stay saddened or discouraged for very long.''</p>
        <p>Besides, they have not exhausted their arsenal. ''A couple neighbors and I talked about sitting up all night on a dark stoop with a flask of martinis,'' she said. To catch a thief.</p>
