        <p>In a society that prides itself on change, it's a little embarrassing to consider the fate of sweet marjoram. A case of mistaken identity dating back to the classification of plants pushed origanum majorana into the oregano family, where it has languished for nearly 250 years. Slightly suspect as bitter and aggressive, marjoram has been relegated -- as most oregano is -- to red sauce and pizza. What a paradox!</p>
        <p>How can a world that allows politicians to change platforms as easily as they change shirts, that celebrates the rehabilitation of white-collar criminals to blue-ribbon citizens, that cheers as young geeks clamber to the highest echelons of cool make no effort to reclaim its gentlest herb?</p>
        <p>There is reason to suspect sexism. Marjoram is a lady in the most outdated sense of the word -- it's downright demure. It works a subtle magic on lamb and pork and veal and chicken. Its flowery sweetness counters the brine in sea scallops or other shellfish and accentuates the sweetness in tomatoes, grilled peppers, fresh corn and carrots.</p>
        <p>But marjoram is not the sort of herb to stand alone, except perhaps on fresh cheese. It doesn't scream for recognition. It isn't strident. It abides.</p>
        <p>At my house upstate, a soft breeze on an early summer day will carry the sweet scent of marjoram from the pot on the back porch through the window to my desk. It's at this time -- before the little, gnarled branches sprout their creamy flowers -that the oil in marjoram's downy, light green leaves is most pronounced. Other times, the flavor is reticent. It is in the first blush of summer, then, that I remember this subtle herb. It makes me think of cooking delicately -- laying sprigs of the herb inside a split trout or stuffing a chicken with the herb for slow basting and baking.</p>
        <p>Marjoram inspires a light touch. Unlike oregano, which is strong and harsh, marjoram has an elusive, faintly spicy, slightly flowery perfume. It is warm and sunny, suggestive and flirty. But it is fragile, best used at the end of cooking, just before serving.</p>
        <p>Legend has it that Aphrodite discovered marjoram in the ocean and took it to the top of Mount Ida to be closer to the sun. The Greeks called it ''joy of the mountains'' -- oros is mountain, ganos is joy or brightness -- which explains its taxonomic name.</p>
        <p>But we have only the soul of marjoram to explain why the herb, along with rosemary and lavender, was traditionally used in potpourri, in garlands for newlyweds, in funeral bouquets, in love potions and in folk remedies as a tonic and a carminative. Perhaps we have only ourselves -- along with the tyrant of habit that allows mistakes to become conventions -- to blame for marjoram's unwarranted neglect.</p>
        <p>Lacking a rehabilitation campaign, marjoram remains the cognoscenti's herb. A slick ad campaign could probably fix this. After all, this is America, where one generation's weed becomes the next generation's mesclun lettuce.</p>
        <p>Marjoram-and-Yogurt-Baked Striped Bass  1 1/2 cups red lentils (about 12 ounces)  Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  2 medium whole striped bass (about 1 1/2 pounds each)  1 cup Greek-style yogurt  12 sprigs marjoram  8 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil.</p>
        <p>1. Place the lentils in a medium pot and cover with hot water by 1 inch. Set aside to soak for 1 hour.</p>
        <p>2. Drain the lentils, return them to the pot and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until very tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and discard the liquid. Season the lentils with salt and pepper. Spread the lentils evenly in the bottom of a 14-by-11-inch roasting pan.</p>
        <p>3. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Season the bass generously all over with salt and pepper and coat with the yogurt, including the cavity. Stuff the mouths and cavities of each bass with marjoram sprigs and garlic. Arrange the bass in the roasting pan on top of the lentils and drizzle with the oil. Bake until brown and crispy, about 35 minutes. Transfer the bass and lentils to a large platter and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Savory Marjoram-and-Zucchini Pudding  1 tablespoon olive oil  1 medium Spanish onion, finely chopped  4 cloves garlic, finely chopped  5 medium zucchini (about 2 1/2 pounds), trimmed and roughly chopped  Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh marjoram  1 large egg, beaten</p>
        <p>1/2 cup mascarpone.</p>
        <p>1. In a medium pot with a tight-fitting lid, over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the onion and cook, covered, stirring frequently, until soft and translucent, about 12 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Raise the heat to medium-high, add zucchini and 1 cup water and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 10 minutes. Uncover and cook, stirring frequently, until somewhat dry and stiff, about 6 minutes. Remove from the heat. Using a fork, mash the zucchini mixture into a pulp and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the marjoram, egg and mascarpone.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Scrape the zucchini mixture into a greased 8-inch loaf pan and bake until lightly browned on top, about 20 minutes. Serve with roasted chicken or grilled pork chops.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Marjoram-Potato-and- Roasted-Poblano Tacos  5 medium Idaho potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled and cut into  1/2-inch dice  4 poblano peppers</p>
        <p>1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons vegetable oil  16 white-corn tortillas</p>
        <p>1/2 large Spanish onion, thinly sliced</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  3 tablespoons finely chopped marjoram  Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1/4 cup cotija or feta cheese (about 1 1/4 ounces)  8 lime wedges.</p>
        <p>1. In a medium pot, over high heat, add the potatoes and cover with cold salted water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until very tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, preheat the broiler. In a bowl, toss the peppers with 1 tablespoon oil. Transfer the peppers to a foil-lined baking sheet, place under the broiler and broil, turning occasionally, until black and blistered, about 8 minutes. Return the peppers to the bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and let stand 5 minutes. Using a paring knife, scrape the blackened skins off the peppers and discard them. Slice the peppers in half lengthwise, discard the stem and seeds and cut into  1/2-inch-wide strips.</p>
        <p>3. In a medium cast-iron skillet, over medium heat, heat  1/2cup oil. Add 1 tortilla and cook, turning once, until soft and pliable, about 3 seconds per side. Transfer to a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, laying them on the baking sheet to form 8 stacks of 2 tortillas each.</p>
        <p>4. In a large skillet, over high heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add the potatoes, peppers and cinnamon and cook 2 minutes more. Stir in marjoram and season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat, cover and set aside.</p>
        <p>5. In a medium cast-iron skillet, over medium-high heat, add a tortilla stack and cook, turning once, until lightly browned, about 30 seconds per side. Return to the baking sheet and repeat with the remaining tortilla stacks. Divide the potato mixture among the tortilla stacks and sprinkle with the cheese. Fold the stacks in half and transfer to a serving platter. Serve with lime wedges.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Marjoram-Glazed Orange Tartlets  For the dough:  12 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 tablespoon granulated sugar  1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt  1 large egg</p>
        <p>For the filling:  2 oranges, sliced very thin, ends discarded and seeds removed  6 tablespoons orange juice</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
        <p>1/2 cup granulated sugar  5 tablespoons all-purpose flour  1 large egg, beaten</p>
        <p>For the glaze:</p>
        <p>1/4 cup granulated sugar  3 tablespoons marjoram, roughly chopped  4 teaspoons pistachios, roughly chopped.</p>
        <p>1. To make the dough, in an electric mixer cream the butter and sugar until light and soft. Add the flour and salt and continue to mix until just incorporated. Mix in the egg and 1 tablespoon water. Form the dough into a flat disc, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. To make the filling, in a food processor combine the oranges, juice, salt and sugar and pulse until roughly chopped. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and mix in the flour and egg. Set aside.</p>
        <p>3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a large square about  1/8-inch thick. Cut the dough into 4 equal squares. Place the dough squares over 4 5-inch tartlet pans, press the dough into the pans and trim the edges. With a fork, prick the dough in several places. Line the shells with parchment paper and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Transfer to a baking sheet and bake until edges are light brown, about 20 minutes. Remove the paper and beans and continue to bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>4. Fill shells with the filling and smooth the tops with a rubber spatula. Return tarts to the oven and bake until set, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.</p>
        <p>5. To make the glaze, in a small saucepan, over high heat, combine the sugar and  1/4 cup water and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the marjoram. Brush the tarts liberally with the glaze. When cool, remove the tarts from their pans, sprinkle with pistachios and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
