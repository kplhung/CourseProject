        <p>After a $3 million, yearlong renovation, the Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden, designed in 1915 and the first public Japanese garden in America, has reopened at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Severely eroded hills have been restored and replanted with azaleas, pines and weeping cherries; the pond has been dredged, and soft ferns, dwarf bamboo and Japanese irises now edge its wide banks.</p>
        <p>The Torii gate that rises out of the water, signaling entry to a sacred place, is now an eye-stopping orange-red, and a smooth path, wide enough for wheelchairs and baby carriages, leads around the pond. The old fence, which kept visitors from peeking at the vistas of tall pines and wisteria blooming over the pavilion, has been replaced by a graceful larch fence with a snowcap top and eye-level openings that allow views of all angles of the garden.</p>

        <p>After a $3 million, yearlong renovation, the Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden, designed in 1915 and the first public Japanese garden in America, has reopened at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Severely eroded hills have been restored and replanted with azaleas, pines and weeping cherries; the pond has been dredged, and soft ferns, dwarf bamboo and Japanese irises now edge its wide banks.</p>
        <p>The Torii gate that rises out of the water, signaling entry to a sacred place, is now an eye-stopping orange-red, and a smooth path, wide enough for wheelchairs and baby carriages, leads around the pond. The old fence, which kept visitors from peeking at the vistas of tall pines and wisteria blooming over the pavilion, has been replaced by a graceful larch fence with a snowcap top and eye-level openings that allow views of all angles of the garden.</p>
        <p>The restoration has been true to the spirit of the original garden, designed in 1915 by Takeo Shiota, who freely mixed classical elements -- like the cascading waterfall and terraced hills with ''cloud pruned'' shrubs and trees -- with idiosyncrasies like bronze cranes poised in the water (there are no bird sculptures in Japanese gardens) and the rather epic nature of the Torii gate, which echoes the great Miyajima gate that stands in the Inland Sea of Japan. Even the waterfall, designed by Italian stonemasons, is a bit more grotto than meandering brook.</p>
        <p>But the kami, the Shinto spirits of nature, can be felt in the tall pines, rocks and water. And flowering trees and shrubs still mark the fleeting nature of life. The timelessness of this peaceful place is wonderfully intact.</p>
        <p>The Brooklyn Botanic Garden, 1000 Washington Avenue, is open Tuesday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturday, Sunday and holidays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission $3, $1.50 for those over 65 and students, free for ages 15 and under. Free Tuesday and Saturday, 10 a.m. to noon. Information: (718) 623-7200.</p>
