        <p>JUST below the grand total of my April bill, $575.65, the Fairmount Wyndham Historic Hotel in San Antonio announced:</p>
        <p>''Bexar County requires that an additional tax of 1.75% be imposed on each hotel charge for the purpose of financing a venue project, consisting of a new sports and community arena approved by the voters of the county on Nov. 2, 1999.'' According to David Marquez, project manager for the San Antonio Community Arena, the statement's tortured wording is required by a 1997 state law allowing such local taxes.</p>
        <p>Compared with the 6 percent Texas state tax and the 9 percent city occupancy tax, it was a bagatelle: two of us paid $10.64 to help give the  San Antonio Spurs basketball team a $175 million arena that would allow them to move out of the football-size  Alamodome, which opened in 1993. But the new 1.75 percent put San Antonio hotel taxes at 16.75 percent, barely behind Houston's 17 percent (which apparently leads the nation, something Joan Johnson, president of the Houston Hotel and Motel Association, is not happy about).</p>
        <p>The next day in San Antonio, when I signed for my rental car, I contributed another $7.12 -- 5 percent -- toward the arena. The footnote was cryptic: ''Tax includes 5% venue fee.'' It confirmed my doubts about the word ''fee'' and crystallized my distaste for the word ''venue.''</p>
        <p>On Nov. 2, the same day the Bexar County voters selected me and other out-of-towners to underwrite their new arena, voters in St. Paul rejected a sales-tax increase of half a percentage point to build a ballpark.</p>
        <p>Port Fees Blockaded</p>
        <p>Tax the visitor is a old game, but it has recently developed wrinkles as big as the Rocky Mountains. Earlier this year, Florida legislators received a bill similar to the Texas bill,  to finance a $400 million baseball stadium through a tax on cruise passengers using ''big ports,'' defined so that only Miami qualified. It would have come to $4 to $8 a day per passenger. The president of Carnival Cruise Lines, Bob Dickinson, said at the end of March that if the bill passed, the line would not base a new vessel in Miami but in Port Everglades, and Cunard, which Carnival owns, would cancel Miami calls by the Queen Elizabeth 2. The bill was then buried by Gov. Jeb Bush, who said he would veto it.</p>
        <p>In the New York City budget debate, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council pushed and pulled on a longtime $2 per-room per-night hotel tax. The Mayor argued that the potential loss of $38 million in revenue for a full fiscal year would be made up by 2004 by increased business. He cited 1994, when New York City held the infamous top spot on national travel-tax charts: 19.25 percent, plus the $2, for rooms over $100 a night. Under heavy travel-industry pressure, the Legislature voted to drop the state portion of the hotel tax, which was 5 percent for rooms over $100, on Sept. 1, 1994. Then on Dec. 1, the city dropped one point of its room tax, lowering it to 5 percent, plus the $2. These actions pulled New York City back from the forefront, with taxes of 13.25 percent plus $2: 8.25 percent in sales taxes everyone pays, plus the 5 percent city add-on.</p>
        <p>The Mayor said that despite a revenue falloff after 1994, the city was now collecting $120 million more than it did before the rollback. In the latest debate, the City Council said that with hotels overflowing, it did not have to make New York more lovable to travelers, but it eventually gave in; the tax cut stayed in the budget agreement reached earlier this month. If the enabling bill is adopted, the $2 tax ends Jan. 1, 2001.</p>
        <p>An Increase in Omaha</p>
        <p>San Antonio voters are not alone in raising travel taxes: those in Omaha just weighed in. Right now, Omaha has checkout taxes of 11.5 percent -- 5 percent in state and city lodging taxes and 6.5 percent in regular city sales tax -- plus $2 a room a night for improvements in Rosenblatt Stadium, home to minor-league baseball and the College World Series. The $2 is applied first and it is also taxed at 11.5 percent, bringing the stadium bite to $2.23 a night. But on May 9, Omaha voters abandoned the $2 add-on for a plan that will raise checkout taxes to 15.96 percent in January, with the extra money to pay for a $280 million convention center and arena. The Omaha Convention and Visitors Bureau is not happy to see the level going past 15 percent. ''We are afraid of appearing on the radar screen,'' said Tim McNeil, a bureau spokesman. ''We were against it because there was even a backlash over the $2. But the voters were overwhelmingly in favor of it.''</p>
        <p>What are little increments worth to a city? April is San Antonio's biggest tourism month. Mr. Marquez said the city collected $800,000 to $1 million with the new hotel tax that month and $400,000 with the 5 percent car-rental tax. At that rate, it would take about 146 months like April to pay the county's share of the Spurs' new arena. But, Mr. Marquez said, it is all debt financing. ''We looked for other ways, but everything fell through,'' he said. ''The Spurs did not want a sales tax vote.''</p>
        <p>John T. Kaatz, a consultant to convention industries, said 15 percent is the line at which hotel taxes begin to get national attention and affect decision-making. Mr. Kaatz, director of convention industry services for Conventions, Sports and Leisure International in Minneapolis, said that while cities may with impunity put asterisks on the bills of individual travelers, especially those with no choice about where business takes them, the people who book conventions and meetings can decide how high a hotel tax they want to endure.</p>
        <p>''A while ago, Columbus, Ohio, at 15.75 percent was the only city over 15 percent,'' he said. ''But if you have a choice of taking your convention to Houston or New Orleans, the jury is still out on whether that 17 percent is going to tip the decision against Houston.'' While Houston has 17 percent, the New Orleans hotel tax is 11 percent plus $1, $2 or $3, depending on the hotel's size.</p>
        <p>Convention planners may not have the instant impact of Carnival's threat, but they have influence. In 1994 in New York, hotels mustered figures for conventions the city had lost because of the tax bite. Private travelers cannot do a lot other than ask at reservation time what taxes apply. Calls to 800 numbers may not be fruitful when a tax is going up, as in Omaha; local reservations people are more likely to know. Web sites seldom seem to mention local taxes.</p>
        <p>The meetings coordinator for the Food Allergy Network in Fairfax, Va., Naomi Romanchok, said that learning about the add-ons was not always easy. ''In downtown Washington, a $130 hotel room can end up costing you lots more,'' she said. ''And meeting planners who go to look may get a complimentary room, so they never see a bill.'' Washington's rate is 14.5 percent.</p>
