        <p>I HAD not been paying much attention to hockey this season. For one thing, the sadistic cable company in my part of New Jersey makes me watch the Rangers, anathema to a Devils fan. But the Stanley Cup playoffs were special this year. All my teams would be there. ESPN and ABC. Yes. I can get those.</p>
        <p>I had become a fan when a veteran player in the National Hockey League did not have to wear a helmet. Bobby Clark had a captain's C sewn to his Flyers sweater. The Broad Street Bullies. Two Stanley Cups. 1974. 1975.</p>
        <p>Years later, I moved from eastern Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh, and it was the Penguins and Super Mario. Two Stanley Cups. 1991. 1992.</p>
        <p>Are you beginning to see a pattern here?</p>
        <p>By 1995, I was in New Jersey, and, as much as I had cheered for the Flyers and the Penguins, I always root for the hometown team. That was the Devils. They had won the Stanley Cup in '95. Now they were back for another try. With me in town, how could they lose? Like Rodney Dangerfield and New Jersey, I often get no respect, but with such  hockey mojo, how could Philadelphia and Pittsburgh have ever let me go?</p>
        <p>Hockey players are a superstitious bunch and so are some of their fans. We look for omens, watch for signs. My Penguins had won the Cup in 1991 by beating the Minnesota North Stars, who dropped the North and moved to Texas. Now those Stars had to play my Devils. Two cups for my Flyers. Two cups for my Penguins. With my mojo working for the Devils, the Stars did not stand a chance.</p>
        <p>But the Devils had developed a bad habit in the playoffs of bowing out early. 1990. 1991. 1992. 1993. And, after winning the Cup, they regressed. 1998. 1999. Not a good sign. But they came through to the finals unscathed, if not unscared. Down three games to one against the Flyers in the conference championship, they climbed a mountain that is all but impossible to climb. The Bullies lost the series. My streak was intact.</p>
        <p>The Stars began their defense of the Stanley Cup on May 30 in the Meadowlands. They were the champions, but the Devils had been impressive. A long, tough series, I reasoned, favored the Devils. Besides, with my record in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, you can see why I was only mildly surprised when the Devils won the first game with a seven-goal barrage. The Devils were just getting started, and although the 7-3 victory was a good beginning, the score in the series was only 1-0.</p>
        <p>But in the second game the Devils came out strong, but after Jay Pandolfo went through the glass on a check by Mike Keane, the Devils seemed to lose momentum. Outcomes can turn on such unlikely events. Fifteen seconds after play resumed, Brett Hull scored. He scored again with 4:16 left to give the Stars the 2-1 victory and tie the series at one game apiece. Was breaking the glass like breaking a mirror?</p>
        <p>On the Saturday after Memorial Day, the series moved to Reunion Arena in Dallas, where the Stars were all but unbeatable. But the Devils turned the tables with a 2-1 victory in Game 3, and by the end of Game 4, also in Dallas, I was sure the broken glass had not diminished my mojo's power.</p>
        <p>Down 1-0 in the fourth game, the Devils came out in the third period and scored three rapid goals. The authority with which they took charge of that game told me they were the better team, but the better team does not always win.</p>
        <p>The series stood at 3-1 Devils and was headed back to New Jersey. This is where I also began to realize just how great a series this was. How the underdog Devils had rocked the champions, and how the Stars had reached down after each blow for an extra helping of grit. Our ice, their ice, it did not matter.</p>
        <p>Game 5, on June 8, a Thursday, went to three overtimes. I wanted to see the Devils win the Cup at home, but I had an early wakeup. If I went to bed and the Devils won, I would be disappointed not to have seen it, but happy nevertheless. If the game went the other way, well, I would not want to stay up for that. Eddie Belfour faced 48 shots on goal and made 48 saves. Martin Brodeur stopped 40 shots, but let one get by. There would be another game, and I would be there with my mojo, this time until the end.</p>
        <p>Three overtimes is unusual, even in a tight series like this one. Somebody usually gets lucky, takes advantage of a good bounce. I expected Game 6, back in Dallas, to be decided for good or ill in three periods. Part of me, the same very small and selfish part that had allowed me to go to bed two nights earlier, wanted the Devils win the title on home ice. But if the series went to seven games, the Cup would be up for grabs. Down three games to one against the Flyers, the Devils had come back. It was unlikely such a thing would happen again so soon, but it could.</p>
        <p>Back-to-back overtimes were unlikely, too, but after four periods on Saturday night, the score remained knotted, 1-1. One thing was certain. No one was going to bed. In the small hours in front of the flickering television tube in the basement of a small house in the New Jersey suburbs, I remained confident, if no longer certain, of the outcome. Dallas was good. Very good. Early on, Derian Hatcher had taken out Petr Sykora at almost the same spot on the ice where Scott Stevens had knocked out Eric Lindros, the Flyers' huge but fragile star, with a jaw-rattling check in the conference final. Another omen? Would it throw a wrench into the Devils' superb scoring machine, the one they would certainly need? The answer came at 8:20 into the second excruciating period of overtime.</p>
        <p>You have to lift the puck to beat  Belfour, the Devils had been told. It was advice they had not always heeded. But Patrik Elias dug out the puck from the far corner and sent it crisply back to Jason Arnott. Arnott lifted the puck. Short side over Belfour's shoulder. Score! Textbook.</p>
        <p>And, just like that, it was over. I raised a fist. ''Yes,'' I shouted to the basement walls. The Devils had won their second Stanley Cup. 1995. 2000.</p>
        <p>It isn't just me. And maybe New Jersey doesn't always get the respect it deserves. But on Saturday night the Devils made us both look good.</p>
