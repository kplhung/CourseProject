        <p>Eight years after the Clinton campaign adopted ''It's the economy, stupid,'' as its mantra, the presidential race of 2000 has raised an intriguing question: has the new economy changed some of the old rules of politics?</p>
        <p>It has long been a maxim that the economic health of the nation goes a long way toward determining who wins the White House. Voters reward the party in power for good times and punish it for bad. By rights, this should bode well for Vice President Al Gore as the Clinton administration presides over a 112-month economic expansion, the longest in the nation's history.</p>

        <p>Eight years after the Clinton campaign adopted ''It's the economy, stupid,'' as its mantra, the presidential race of 2000 has raised an intriguing question: has the new economy changed some of the old rules of politics?</p>
        <p>It has long been a maxim that the economic health of the nation goes a long way toward determining who wins the White House. Voters reward the party in power for good times and punish it for bad. By rights, this should bode well for Vice President Al Gore as the Clinton administration presides over a 112-month economic expansion, the longest in the nation's history.</p>
        <p>But as Mr. Gore set off on his ''prosperity and progress'' tour this week, staking his most forceful claim yet to the administration's economic legacy, polls showed him lagging behind Gov. George W. Bush of Texas when Americans were asked which candidate they trusted more to handle the nation's economy. And Mr. Bush, for his part, simply shrugs off those who say that the nation's prosperity will ultimately derail him.</p>
        <p>''If people want four more years of Clinton-Gore,'' Mr. Bush told an audience in Connecticut late last week, and ''all that matters is the stock market, I'll be the governor.''</p>
        <p>In part, Mr. Bush, like Republicans throughout the Clinton years, is calculating that concerns about the president's character and unease with society's moral tone will prove stronger than the economy.</p>
        <p>But some Republicans also say they are seeing something else this election year. Like the economists who wonder whether the expansion has repealed some of the fundamental principles of the business cycle, these strategists suggest that the boom has changed politics. The country has now been so prosperous for so long, they assert, that voters simply take good times for granted.</p>
        <p>''When Clinton got elected in 1992, people thought the economy was in the toilet and good times would not come back again,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who has been doing research for MSNBC. ''Today everyone thinks that they are going to make money. Young people are more entrepreneurial than ever before. More people are in the stock market. It's so much of a given that the economy is good that no one is saying thank you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides make a slightly different argument: that in this economic boom driven by high technology, people view the titans of e-commerce and the computer age as the job creators, not the government.</p>
        <p>''I think the American people instinctively know a lot of today's economy and a lot of today's prosperity was created by the young entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director.</p>
        <p>Another Bush adviser pointed to a Fox News poll taken last month showing that Americans overwhelmingly give more credit to William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, for creating jobs than they do to President Clinton. ''One of Gore's fundamental problems is he's not getting any credit for the good economy,'' the adviser said.</p>
        <p>And in some ways the Bush campaign is as vested in this faith in the new economy as Mr. Gore is, though for different reasons. In making his proposal to divert some of the Social Security payroll tax into private investment accounts, Mr. Bush is gambling that with half of American households now holding stock, voters will not see the stock market as more risky than having a guaranteed Social Security benefit.</p>
        <p>Democrats argue that prosperity will still sway voters come Election Day and note that Mr. Clinton has consistently won extraordinarily high approval ratings for his stewardship of the economy. A New York Times/CBS News Poll taken in February found that an unprecedented 73 percent of all Americans said they approved of the way Mr. Clinton was handling the economy. Indeed, 88 percent said the national economy was in good shape, a far cry from the  23 percent who said that about the economy in 1992, when Bill Clinton defeated President George Bush.</p>
        <p>The challenge for Mr. Gore, his supporters say, is to convince voters that when it comes to the economy, it matters who is president.</p>
        <p>''The danger to Gore is not that people don't give Clinton credit for the economy but that people think the economy is so good Bush couldn't possibly screw it up,'' Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said. ''He needs to make the case why Bush represents an economic risk for middle class Americans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore took up that challenge this week when he went beyond his previous warnings that Mr. Bush's proposals were risky, a strategy that had left him looking like the candidate of the status quo. This week, he made the argument that the administration had given Americans the tools to succeed and that he would continue to do so. He then set out alternatives to Mr. Bush's proposals.</p>
        <p>So instead of diverting some Social Security payroll tax to individual investment accounts as Mr. Bush would, Mr. Gore proposed to create similar savings accounts on top of Social Security.</p>
        <p>Instead of Mr. Bush's 10-year, $1.3 trillion across-the-board tax cut, Mr. Gore would offer $500 billion in cuts aimed at particular purposes like college education. And Mr. Gore's aides hope to contrast his advocacy of education and environmental programs with Mr. Bush's support for a missile defense system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides say that these choices will work to their benefit in the fall with the moderate middle. ''We think the dynamics are going to be very different probably come convention time or Labor Day,'' Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman, said. ''The election is not about who gets credit for the economy so much as who will make the right choices for the future,'' Mr. Hattaway said.</p>
        <p>A key question is how voters will respond to Mr. Gore. Mr. Bush has spent months trying to erase doubts about his intellect and to raise questions about whether Mr. Gore is enough of a leader to take advantage of the good economy.</p>
        <p>The governor's spring blitz of policy speeches showed him setting the campaign's agenda. And he used the speeches to charge that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore were squandering the good times instead of dealing with longer-term problems.</p>
        <p>''At a time for leadership -- for long-term thinking -- my opponent proposes a Band-Aid approach,'' Mr. Bush said of Mr. Gore in his speech proposing Social Security investment accounts to deal with the strain on Social Security's finances when the baby boom generation retires.</p>
        <p>In Ohio on Friday, he tried to undercut Mr. Gore, portraying the Democrats' tax cut proposals as products of polling. ''America doesn't want a focus-group driven presidency,'' he said, and added later, ''I'm not one of those people who likes to chase after public opinion.''</p>
