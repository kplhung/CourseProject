        <p>A week after New Jersey's epic Senate primary, Jon S. Corzine fired most of his campaign staff, leaving a mere 17 employees and 4 consultants on the payroll. Then he took off for a 10-day vacation in the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>Bob Franks, meanwhile, beefed up his campaign operation by a whopping 80 percent -- to nine people. And while he headed to Washington to vote on bills in the House, his political aides set about raising enough money to run an effective race against Mr. Corzine in the fall.</p>
        <p>It won't be easy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, who squeaked past State Senator William L. Gormley in the Republican senatorial primary, is well-liked in party circles but barely known outside his district, meaning he will have to spend heavily just to pull within range of Mr. Corzine's expensively purchased name recognition.</p>
        <p>''Franks starts at a huge disadvantage,'' said Cliff Zukin, director of The Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll. ''Because the Republican primary was so under the radar screen, Franks is probably only known to about 10 to 25 percent of the electorate. In New Jersey you pay three times: first to get known, then to get liked and then to get preferred. It's probably going to take Franks $6 million just to get known.''</p>
        <p>Advisers to Representative Franks insist that they are not scared by Mr. Corzine's $400 million fortune or his willingness to shell out close to $35 million in the primary. ''We do not need, nor could we ever hope to, match Jon Corzine dollar for dollar,'' said Charlie Smith, Mr. Franks's campaign manager. ''No matter how much we raise, he can always beat the living hell out of us.''</p>
        <p>But to run an effective fall campaign will take $12 million or more, said Candace Straight, a merchant banker who is the finance chairwoman of Mr. Franks's campaign.</p>
        <p>Of that, at least half will have to come from within New Jersey, she said, meaning that Mr. Franks's summer is likely to quickly turn into an endless series of invitation-only breakfasts, lunches, cocktail parties and dinners.</p>
        <p>Ms. Straight said she would hope to raise another $750,000 to $1.5 million from political-action committees in Washington, which gave $476,550 to Mr. Franks's primary campaign.</p>
        <p>But the campaign will need to raise at least $4 million or $5 million in other states. That might involve reciprocal arrangements with out-of-state candidates eager to tap into New Jersey's wealthy Republican donor base, Ms. Straight said. New York alone, where the little-known Representative Rick Lazio is hastily raising money to take on Hillary Rodham Clinton, could be good for more than $1 million, she said.</p>
        <p>The pitch will be a simple one, said Mr. Franks: Donors will be reminded that New Jersey's open seat is an important opportunity to maintain or expand the Republican's six-seat majority in the Senate. And they will be told much about Mr. Corzine's left-wing agenda, he said.</p>
        <p>''The more people know about Jon Corzine's reckless spending programs that would bankrupt the federal treasury, the more energized they will become over this race, and that will help significantly in our efforts to put together our campaign treasury,'' Mr. Franks said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani tried the same approach with great success against Mrs. Clinton, raising $19 million largely through direct-mail appeals to conservatives nationwide that referred to the First Lady as the ''darling of the left-wing elite.''</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Corzine may have become the latest national whipping boy for advocates of campaign finance reform, he hardly touches the same emotions among right-wing voters as does Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>And Bob Franks, it must be said, is no Rudy Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks may also seek to generate financial support from the religious right; a hint in that direction came last week when he attacked Mr. Corzine for not supporting a Constitutional amendment outlawing flag-burning. But Mr. Franks, who supports adoption by gay couples, may have difficulty building enthusiasm among members of the Christian Coalition.</p>
        <p>Finally, the Franks campaign can also hope for up to $829,636 in hard money from the National Republican Senatorial Committee in addition to untold thousands more in soft-money independent expenditures.</p>
        <p>But here again, there are caveats: The senatorial committee, run out of Washington, is most likely to spend first to protect its incumbents, second to help the most competitive challengers, and third in cheaper media markets where it can get the greatest bang for its buck.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, therefore, will have to prove he can raise money on his own before others are likely to throw huge sums into what otherwise could seem a losing effort.</p>
        <p>By Sept. 30, Ms. Straight said, Mr. Franks's campaign will have had to raise $3 million to $5 million to make that case persuasively.</p>
        <p>All in all, there is little time to waste.</p>
        <p>New Jersey Democrats, quite naturally, are enjoying a little Schadenfreude.</p>
        <p>''Bob Torricelli started fund-raising in August of 1995, as soon as Bill Bradley withdrew from the race,'' said Jamie Fox, who was Senator Torricelli's chief of staff and now heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ''He worked morning, noon and night for 15 months to raise $10 million. Now, Bob Franks is starting in June. It's not humanly possible.''</p>
