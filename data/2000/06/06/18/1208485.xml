        <p>''I DON'T think the producer has to know much,'' says John Travolta as Chili Palmer, a mobster who decides to become a movie mogul and finds he's more than qualified. GET SHORTY (1995), based on Elmore Leonard's best seller and directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, is satire at its sharpest. Rene Russo, gene Hackman and Delroy Lindo are in fine form. And pay attention to Bear the stunt man this time; he's James Gandolfini, now of ''The Sopranos'' - Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channel 4.</p>

        <p>''I DON'T think the producer has to know much,'' says John Travolta as Chili Palmer, a mobster who decides to become a movie mogul and finds he's more than qualified. GET SHORTY (1995), based on Elmore Leonard's best seller and directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, is satire at its sharpest. Rene Russo, gene Hackman and Delroy Lindo are in fine form. And pay attention to Bear the stunt man this time; he's James Gandolfini, now of ''The Sopranos'' - Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channel 4.</p>
        <p>Talk about having it all. In ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968), pretty young Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and her husband (John Cassavetes) are in love, he's just gotten a great acting job, they've moved into an apartment in the Upper West Side's most fabulous building - the Dakota - and now Rosemary is pregnant. Too bad the father is the Devil and the creepy elderly neighbors (among them Ruth Gordon, who won the best supporting actress Oscar) are a coven of witches who plan to rear the infant as the Antichrist. Roman Polanski directed, with just the right intelligent-horror touch - Saturday at 8 p.m. on Channel 9.</p>
        <p>John Hurt is flawless as the British wit Quentin Crisp in THE NAKED CIVIL SERVANT (1975), a biography directed by Jack Gold. Crisp, who died last November at the age of 90, decided early in life that his mission was to make homo-sexuality ''abundantly clear'' to the world. He did, first as a flashy redhead with bright red nails in 1930's London, eventually as a blue-haired celebrity in New York. The title of this funny but deeply affecting film refers to Crisp's early career as a nude model for art classes. Or, as he explained, ''I discovered my vocation in life: exhibitionist and martyr'' (lots of crucifixion poses) - Saturday at 9 p.m. on Channel 13.</p>
        <p>As Rob Reiner says, they've earned ''a distinguished place in rock history as one of England's loudest bands.'' They are the title characters of THIS IS SPINAL TAP (1984), Mr. Reiner's hilarious mock documentary with Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean. It's dead-on satire about an aging rock group dealing with cancellations, album signings that no one attends and a string of dead drummers. Highlight: The group plays ''Sex Farm Woman'' at an Air Force base social - Thursday at 11 p.m. on VH1.</p>
        <p>Sometimes we wonder if there was anything good about the 50's. A few minutes with Vincente Minnelli's eternally charming FATHER OF THE BRIDE (1950) says it all. In postwar America, marriage lasted (witness Spencer Tracy, in the title role, and Joan Bennett), our daughters looked like Elizabeth Taylor at 18, and the most serious problems behind closed doors were lovers' quarrels and how much the wedding would cost - Sunday at 10 p.m. on TCM.</p>
        <p>The idea seems quaint now, but it took Hollywood decades to make a movie of Erskine Caldwell's 1933 novel GOD'S LITTLE ACRE (1958) because the source material was considered too lurid. The shocker at the time was Tina Louis (before she heard the names Ginger or Gilligan) showing cleavage in a white slip and breathing deeply as she stands near a bare-chested Aldo Ray on a hot Southern night. Anthony Mann's drama seems self-consciously serious now (especially after that incongruously perky theme song), but there's still grit in Caldwell's story of an amoral Georgia farmer (Robert Ryan) who promises one acre's yield to the church (unless that happen to be the spot where Granddaddy's gold is buried) - Friday at midnight on Channel 21.</p>
