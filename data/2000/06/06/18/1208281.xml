        <p>MUSIC can make age meaningless, as the five-year-old New Jersey Intergenerational Orchestra has shown.</p>
        <p>One orchestra member, Benjamin Halpern of South Orange, will turn 89 next month. The oldest member of the orchestra, he sits next to 7-year-old Deberly Kauffman.</p>
        <p>The two violin players were brought together by Lorraine Marks, a public school music teacher in Cranford, who had harbored an idea for years that senior citizens and youngsters could learn from each other if they were brought together in one orchestra.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marks first picked up the viola when she was a teenager and fell in love with it. To encourage her musical ability, her 70-year-old music teacher invited her to sit in with his string quartet, which was made up of his contemporaries.</p>
        <p>''It was wonderful,'' Ms. Marks said. ''They became my mentors.''</p>
        <p>Six years ago Ms. Marks put advertisements in the local newspapers saying she was looking for people of all ages to create a new kind of orchestra.</p>
        <p>''I set up 40 chairs and waited,'' she said. ''I was really nervous because I had no idea if even two people would show up. About 7 p.m. people starting coming in droves and it has been that way ever since.''</p>
        <p>The group now has members from more than 30 communities, mostly in northern and central New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Working with the support of the Cranford school district and the Union County Division of Cultural and Heritage Affairs and other arts groups, Ms. Marks created the 140-member organization, which is really three orchestras: a nouveau, or beginners', group of about 25, a full orchestra of 80, and a chamber orchestra of the 30 most proficient players. Ms. Marks, who is conductor as well as founder, is looking for corporate sponsorship as well.</p>
        <p>''We never turn anyone away,'' she said. ''Everyone fits in somewhere.''</p>
        <p>Deberly's younger sister, Daelyn, who is 4, recently started playing violin and has joined the beginners' orchestra. Their father, William I. Kauffman, is management consultant for the organization.</p>
        <p>Newcomers who are over 60 can get free lessons and free use of an instrument. All types of people are drawn to the orchestra, which recently played at the United Nations as part of the program known as International Year of Older Persons Toward a Society for All Ages.</p>
        <p>Mr. Halpern was recruited for the orchestra when Ms. Marks saw him play with the South Orange Symphony. A retired photographer, he had given up playing violin in college.</p>
        <p>''I renewed my acquaintance with the violin after I retired,'' he said. ''I feel much younger playing with a group that includes youngsters. I've resolved to stay young until I grow old, and that hasn't happened yet. In turn, I hope some of me rubs off on Deberly,'' he said of the 7-year-old who shares his music stand.</p>
        <p>Lester Barsky of South Plainfield also retired a few years ago and was wondering how he would fill his time when he ran into Ms. Marks.</p>
        <p>''I always loved the cello and had gone to a lot of classical concerts when I heard about the orchestra and that I could get free lessons and use of an instrument, so I joined,'' Mr. Barsky said. ''Now I've bought my own cello and I take private lessons.''</p>
        <p>His wife, Libby, who has taken up the viola, also has joined so they could have an activity to do together.</p>
        <p>''The kids are terrific because they learn so fast,'' he said. ''I pick up stuff from them and maybe they are getting something from me at the same time.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Marks is now ready to expand the concept and start a second orchestra in the Princeton area. A concert to promote the idea will be held Thursday starting at 5:15 p.m. at the Princeton Resource Center.</p>
        <p>''When seniors take up a new interest later in life, it enhances their lives,'' Ms. Marks said. ''It's like brain calisthenics.''</p>
        <p>Additional information on the orchestra is available at (908) 709-0084 or www.bobdevlin.com/orches.html.</p>
