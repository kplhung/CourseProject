        <p>THE taxi wars are finally over.</p>
        <p>After years of mutual hostility, the governments of Westchester County and New York City have reached an agreement to respect each other's livery licenses so that drivers who operate in both places will no longer have to pay dual fees or risk harassment by Taxi and Limousine Commission officials.</p>
        <p>County Executive Andrew J. Spano said the agreement was ''the right thing to do,'' and would save money for county livery drivers and passengers. But he added that the county ''will lose a lot of money,'' since the agreement will put an end to the fees for permits that the county earned from city livery drivers.</p>
        <p>Guy Thomas, executive vice president of County Limousine of White Plains, the largest livery service in Westchester, said, ''We are delighted with what's happened.'' The agreement will save his company at least $12,500 a year in fees, he said.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, licensed Westchester livery drivers still cannot take passengers from one spot in New York City to another. But they can pick up and drop off passengers in the city without fear of retaliation by the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission.</p>
        <p>The city and the county have been negotiating an agreement for two and a half years -- a process that was slowed by legal difficulties and a history of acrimony.</p>
        <p>''For those drivers who had to work in the New York area, it was just a nightmare,'' said Salah Chowdury, vice president of Limousine .com, which operates about 40 vehicles out of White Plains. Westchester-based drivers who picked up passengers without the appropriate permits at New York airports risked being ticketed or worse.</p>
        <p>Alan Smith, who operates a livery service out of Scarsdale, was one of many drivers who had a car impounded by New York Taxi and Limousine Commission officials after they stopped him at La Guardia Airport. He had to post a $500 bond and travel to Long Island City to retrieve his car, he said, and the whole misadventure cost him $750.</p>
        <p>Westchester drivers have had some protection against this kind of treatment since the early 1990's, when New York agreed to issue Tier 2 licenses to drivers from outside the city. These allowed Westchester drivers to drop off or pick up passengers for a continuous trip, but they still did not allow them to take passengers from one New York City spot to another.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, several Westchester drivers said they had been harassed and ticketed by New York City officials even after paying the $225 annual fee for a Tier 2 permit.</p>
        <p>In 1999 Westchester began to retaliate, ticketing New York-based livery drivers who crossed into Westchester without an appropriate permit.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, some Westchester drivers felt betrayed by their own Taxi and Limousine Commission, which was formed in 1997 and had begun charging them $250 a year per car in licensing fees. County officials had hoped that vehicles licensed in the county would avoid having to have city permits. But New York resisted granting reciprocity, claiming that it did not have the legal authority to do so.</p>
        <p>As a result, Westchester drivers were paying fees to the city, to the county and in jurisdictions like Yonkers to a local authority.</p>
        <p>''That was never the way we intended the law to be,'' Susan Tolchin, a spokeswoman for the county executive's office, said. ''We did not want to hurt our drivers.''</p>
        <p>One obstacle was state law, which prohibits municipalities from waiving their requirements in exchange for reciprocity from their neighbors, said Diane McGrath-McKechnie, chairwoman of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.</p>
        <p>In addition, the city wanted to be sure that Westchester would mirror the city's own strict regulations on liveries, Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said.</p>
        <p>As part of the agreement, Westchester must bolster its licensing requirements, putting drivers through drug tests, a criminal background check and a defensive driving course.</p>
        <p>The agreement also includes a critical-driver program and a persistent-violator program, which mandate that drivers will have their licenses suspended and eventually revoked if they accumulate too many violation points.</p>
