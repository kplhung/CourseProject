        <p>HOW did Procter &amp; Gamble, arguably the world's pre-eminent marketer of consumer products, fall so far? The company stunned investors on June 8 by announcing that it would miss quarterly earnings projections again and that Durk I. Jager, its chief executive, would step down after just 17 months.</p>
        <p>Given that Mr. Jager himself was supposed to get the company going again, his departure has raised doubts about whether it can squeeze more growth from mature brands like Tide, Pringles and Crest, and whether it can develop promising new ones.</p>
        <p>To provide answers, the company named Alan G. Lafley, the head of North American operations, as its new president and chief executive, and called John Pepper, a P.&amp; G. former chairman and chief executive who came back from retirement, to lead the board again. Mr. Pepper said that the company under Mr. Jager took on ''too much change, too fast.''</p>
        <p>Experts including scholars, consultants, former P.&amp; G. executives and managers of other corporations have their own perspectives on what went wrong and what the company should do to set things right. Following are excerpts from their comments.</p>
        <p>DENNIS MALAMATINAS -- Chief executive of the Burger King unit of Diageo. Former marketing and brand manager at P.&amp; G.</p>
        <p>P.&amp; G. needs to focus on some core brands. They need to put ruthless focus on brands that create value down the road -- about 20 brands out of 400.</p>
        <p>They need to accelerate the introduction of new products and support them. It's a fine balance between becoming a nimble, flexible, agile, less bureaucratic organization, while at the same time preserving great ingredients of the culture.</p>
        <p>The company has some great attributes. But they tried to take out costs too quickly and they tried to shift the culture. The art of the C.E.O. is to preserve the culture while focusing on growth.</p>
        <p>They need to grow their top 10 brands in the top 6 markets. At Burger King, I operate in 67 markets, but I know there are 6 markets that will deliver 80 percent of shareholder value and we have to be ruthless in terms of allocating resources.</p>
        <p>Durk Jager tried to change the culture so quickly that he didn't get the best out of the people. He tried to change the company overnight. Most of the people have been there forever.</p>
        <p>When I talk to my people, I always talk about culture. If I was the C.E.O., I would bring in some fresh blood from outside. They always grew from within. I would bring in two or three top people.</p>
        <p>They are going to come back. They need the right leader and they need to move quickly.</p>
        <p>KAREN FRANCIS -- Chief marketing officer, Internet Capital Group. Former manager of the Oldsmobile division of General Motors. Former Crest brand manager at P.&amp; G.</p>
        <p>I was there from 1984 to 1987, and it really was the boot camp of marketing training. Their marketing approach was focused on really understanding a customer, honing in on them, and that was a very smart and proven strategy for building brands. But the business economy, and the number of choices people have today, are accelerating in ways we haven't seen before. So they should be taking a little bit more risk and getting involved in trying more offerings.</p>
        <p>An excellent example is their new product Febreze [a spray for removing odors from household fabrics]. It was a risk. A company the size of P.&amp; G., with their marketing penetration, should be able to generate more of those products. Everyone is looking for what's new.</p>
        <p>SANJAY DHAR -- Professor of marketing, University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.</p>
        <p>P.&amp; G. is a company that needs a little bit of rethinking of its vision. If you go back a few years, P.&amp; G. essentially started getting rid of people in-house who were doing analytic work. And that doesn't make sense to me, because the marketing environment today is very data intensive. This happened at the same time that other consumer products companies, like Kraft, were adding more marketing people and doing this very successfully.</p>
        <p>P.&amp; G. is good at innovation and spinning new products. They are not good at cost-cutting. A few years ago, they tried to reduce coupons. Now, I have a baby and I end up buying Huggies all the time because they have coupons available and P.&amp; G. cut that out.</p>
        <p>SCOTT COOK -- Chairman and founder of Intuit, the maker of software including Quicken and TurboTax. Former Crisco brand manager at P.&amp; G.</p>
        <p>When I left, I applied the P.&amp; G. method to an industry that sorely needed it. Now we have the two best-selling software titles in retail history. We put it through consumer tests, asked them what they wanted. This software is written for consumers, not technical people.</p>
        <p>The key at P.&amp; G. was research and development. The products were the best. You would do blind taste tests and give the customer Brand X and ours, and they'd always pick ours.</p>
        <p>BERND SCHMITT -- Professor of business, Columbia University. Author of ''Experiential Marketing'' (Free Press, 1999).</p>
        <p>Frankly, the problems are not confined to just P.&amp; G. Unilever, Nestle -- it's almost an industry disease. It's not just about the individual products; it's about the companies behind them. It's similar to the situation that faced I.B.M. in the late 80's.</p>
        <p>Markets are conversations, not transaction tools. You have to talk to customers in a human voice. You can't just project your image on a screen; nowadays customers want different approaches.</p>
        <p>When you look at the products in the supermarkets that are on the cutting edge, like fruit juices and those directed at new-age lifestyles -- this entire culture is missing at P.&amp; G. There's very little product innovation.</p>
        <p>I would suggest that they start experimenting with new product categories and new approaches. Their focus has to be looking at young consumers and how they live.</p>
        <p>FAITH POPCORN -- Consultant and author on marketing and consumer trends.</p>
        <p>Procter &amp; Gamble has such great strengths, and you'd never know it. Usually you have companies that can't shut up about themselves and exaggerate what they do, but here you have a company that is so inhibited.</p>
        <p>The fact is, this company cut the cord to the washboard by creating all these products -- Ivory soap, which was invented in the 1920's; Tide, which came out in 1938 -- and they don't really talk about it. They're such a product-oriented company that they think the products speak for themselves.</p>
        <p>They need to really leverage women. Women don't buy brands; they join them. Without being aware of it, women have joined P.&amp; G. If they knew more about the company, the club could get bigger. It could be the biggest female club in the world.</p>
        <p>If P.&amp; G. did that successfully, the stock price would go up. Women bond to a brand, and one generation of female consumers can lead you to the next -- we call that brand-me-downs. And women would put all their money into P.&amp; G. if they understood what an incredibly female-supportive company this is.</p>
        <p>THANE PRESSMAN -- Chief executive of Tone Brothers, a food distributor based in Des Moines. Former associate advertising manager at P.&amp; G.</p>
        <p>Procter &amp; Gamble is historically very successful at what it does, and it was always a process-driven organization. It was hierarchical and highly centralized. My sense is it is trying to change, and they must to be successful.</p>
        <p>The things Jager was trying to do must be done. They've absolutely got to be faster, more responsive, and accept the reality of product life cycles. They just keep reinventing products like new, improved Tide. And that worked for a while. But they will have a very challenging future.</p>
        <p>KEVIN L. KELLER -- Professor of marketing, Dartmouth College. Author of ''Strategic Brand Management,'' (Prentiss Hall, 1998).</p>
        <p>The biggest issue, I think, with their culture now is they're dealing with a market that has changed so much in the last few years that they need to have more people now that are tuned in to that market.</p>
        <p>I think the savvy marketers are at high-tech firms. If anything, there needs to be some reverse flow. There are a number of good marketers, but there are a lot fewer great marketers. I think that is an issue when you lose those kinds of people. They're just not getting that young talent now.</p>
        <p>BUSINESS  Correction:  June 25, 2000, Sunday  A roundup last Sunday of the views of a variety of experts for revitalizing Procter &amp; Gamble misstated the history of two of the company's products. Ivory soap was invented in 1878, not in the 1920's; Tide detergent was introduced in 1946, not 1938.</p>
