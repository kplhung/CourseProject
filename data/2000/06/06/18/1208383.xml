        <p>Bobby Platt is some kind of genius. When the sex police came around last year as part of the mayor's crusade to clean up the city, they told him that the topless dancers at his bar would have to cover up. Mr. Platt had his employees wear bikini tops.</p>
        <p>When the authorities told him that the ladies could no longer writhe on the mangy carpet, he had them writhe against the mangy wall.</p>
        <p>When the judge told him the bar could no longer advertise as Billy's Topless, he bought a brush and a can of paint and the marquee now reads Billy's Stopless.</p>
        <p>''I didn't just roll off the cabbage truck,'' said Mr. Platt, the manager of this no-frills, no-thrills neighborhood go-go joint at 24th Street and the Avenue of the Americas. ''You can't get around the law. You got to abide by the law.''</p>
        <p>But the law, which prohibits strip clubs and other sex-oriented business from operating within 500 feet of residences, schools, churches and graveyards, has brutalized business, Mr. Platt said.</p>
        <p>His best employees walked out on him last year because men were unwilling to tip women in clothes.</p>
        <p>''The girls couldn't make a living,'' he said. ''They went back to Iowa. They just disappeared.''</p>
        <p>He raised the women's wages by $5 a night. Still, the talent level and the libido at Billy's Stopless have sunk. About the only thing going up is the prices.</p>
        <p>The regulars complain loudly that the humanity has been removed. The margin is so tight that the shots are now measured scrupulously. Exactly one ounce and one ounce only. No more friendly drink. No more shaky hand. A glass of French wine is advertised for $4.50.</p>
        <p>''The only thing topless in here are the liquor bottles,'' said Jesse Disanti, 30, a music producer and regular patron of the arts. ''I guess they've got to make money somehow.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Platt thinks he knows how. This genius of the G-string has concocted a scheme to exploit a loophole in the law, which allows adult entertainment on the premises so long as 60 percent of the floor space is devoted to nonsexual merchandise.</p>
        <p>His plan is to build a wall down the middle of the bar. On the left will be a trough of lasagna and three women clad in bikinis. On the right, near the door, will be two topless go-go girls.</p>
        <p>''It's as simple as fourth grade arithmetic,'' said Mr. Platt, who learned his percentages in South Carolina. ''Five women. Three dressed. Two ain't. That's 60-40 by my calculations.''</p>
        <p>Management at Billy's has always offered chasers of seduction with its suds. Built in 1879, Billy's was known then as the Corner, and was one of the most popular nightspots in the city during the Gay 90's. Both a beer hall and a house of prostitution, the place was closed by the vice squad in 1896.</p>
        <p>Mr. Platt vows never to let that happen again.</p>
        <p>''We're hoping this wall thing's going to work and we can stay open,'' he said. ''They got us earning it a dollar at a time. It's like selling candy in little bits.''</p>
