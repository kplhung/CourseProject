        <p>To help budding entrepreneurs answer questions about starting their own businesses -- ''How much money should I have in the bank during the first year?'' and ''When should I break from my career to begin?'' -- the Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit agency that helps create jobs in the borough, this month opened a center for would-be small-business owners.</p>
        <p>The center, the Brooklyn Entrepreneur Support and Training Center, occupies 600 square feet in the development corporation's offices at 175 Remsen Street, between Court and Clinton Streets in downtown Brooklyn. The center has nine computers with business tools like Microsoft Excel and Word. Seven of the computers have access to the Internet, which the corporation's director, Joan Bartolomeo, says is a magnet for the center's clients. ''Everyone's curious about what it is and what they can do with it,'' she said.</p>
