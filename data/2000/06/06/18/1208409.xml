        <p>AN almost surreal sense of good fortune suffuses the carnival that is the American economy these days. And that, paradoxically, is proving to be a challenge to politicians, who are having trouble finding their footing in a climate where prosperity seems a given and the biggest issue is not too little money but too much of it.</p>
        <p>When the government can afford tax cuts, spending increases and the elimination of the national debt, do the terms liberal and conservative mean anything anymore? When it has been nearly two decades since the last sustained period of economic trouble, can anyone claim to be responsible for the good times, or to have the recipe to keep them rolling?</p>
        <p>Nowhere has the sense of the economy outrunning ideology and political strategy been more pronounced than in the breathtaking improvement in the federal government's finances.Analysts in both parties said last week that budget surplus projections for the next decade could be revised upward again in the next month by as much as $1 trillion, an amount roughly equivalent to the entire economic output of China this year.</p>
        <p>That would drive total projected 10-year budget surpluses, including Social Security and general revenue, to more than $4 trillion, even by conservative estimates. And although the precise numbers are little more than guesswork -- and could drop sharply if the economy or the stock market goes into a protracted swoon -- economists are in broad agreement that there  will be large and growing surpluses for years to come.</p>
        <p>In a sense, that good news presented a problem for Vice President Al Gore by undermining one of the central messages of his campaign, that Gov. George W. Bush was fiscally irresponsible. Faced with the likelihood of a much larger surplus, Mr. Gore scrambled to turn the news to his advantage, doubling the size of his tax cut, proposing his own version of retirement savings accounts and making the case for additional spending on education, health care and the environment.</p>
        <p>With his expensive platform of tax cuts, Social Security overhaul and a national missile defense program suddenly looking more affordable, Mr. Bush could have been forgiven a smirk. The Texan even gained room to claim that he would be committed to debt reduction, just like his opponent. Yet Mr. Bush's insistence that Washington is profligate and would have to tighten its belt in most areas other than the military began to ring hollow.</p>
        <p>We've got peace and prosperity and a surplus,'' said James Thurber, a professor of government at American University in Washington. ''That creates a new kind of politics. They no longer have to make tough decisions to balance the budget. They no longer have to cut popular programs to get tax cuts, or to increase taxes, God forbid, in order to pay for things.''</p>
        <p>But to the degree that they no longer define themselves through the fight over how to allocate scarce resources, the two parties may have to retool their ideologies or risk losing their identities.</p>
        <p>''The old left-right guideposts are no longer reliable,'' said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, the research group for centrist Democrats. ''They hark back to the conflicts of an industrial society that is being eclipsed by the new economy. Ideologues in Washington and activists at the grass roots level have an investment in maintaining the old polarities, but the electorate is less and less interested in them.''</p>
        <p>David Brooks, the author of ''Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There,'' a look at how affluence has made a hash of traditional value systems and cultural identities, said prosperity is creating ''a style of politician who goes off in both directions at once.'' In trying to merge opposing views of the world, he said, politicians are combining elements of left and right under rubrics that are given fancy names like the Third Way but could equally be viewed as ''ideological mush.''</p>
        <p>It is not that traditional politics and ideology do not matter at all. It may only have been divided government that has kept Republicans from using the surplus to slash taxes in a way that would starve the government of revenues and power in the long run, and the Democrats from pushing through expensive social programs. This year's presidential race is in many ways about whether one party should have a mandate to use the bounty of the long expansion.</p>
        <p>But the partisan lines are blurring. Republicans in Congress have grown more willing to spend money and tolerate, if not embrace, big and powerful government -- a sea change from 1995, when the Gingrich revolution promised the elimination of entire cabinet agencies.</p>
        <p>''It's what I only half-jokingly call the curse of the surplus: You can't get anyone interested in cutting anything,'' said Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee. ''Politicians are in the game of being able to give away rather than take away.''</p>
        <p>IT is the same on the other side of the aisle. Earlier this month, 65 Democrats in the House voted in favor of repealing the federal estate tax, and nearly all Democrats voted to slash the estate tax substantially -- a move the party had long held up as the epitome of a giveaway to the very richest people at the expense of the poorest. Class warfare, many Democrats seemed to be saying, does not make as much sense when most voters are solidly middle class or above.</p>
        <p>In such a fluid situation, the rules of the political game are uncertain. Mr. Gore began a push last week to wrap himself in the strong economy, assuming that voters, as they always have, will tend to favor the incumbent party when times are good. But polls do not show much evidence that Mr. Gore is seen as prosperity's steward. What if voters see the economy as a the creation of rapid technological change, and no longer connect it with Washington?</p>
        <p>Regardless of who wins, the next president will have a long list of immediate and looming issues to address, and fewer fiscal constraints in doing so than any president since Lyndon B. Johnson. Or maybe the carnival will pull out of town and leave behind another mess.</p>
