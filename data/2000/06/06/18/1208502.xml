        <p>The boy arrived in the United States at age 13, and English for him seemed like an unsolvable puzzle. He knew some of the words, but he could not put them together. It would be four years before he felt confident enough around strangers to assemble it all into any real conversation.</p>
        <p>Swimming was different. The flint of a young boy's talent had sparked the flame of a promising career back in Odessa, Ukraine. Lenny Krayzelburg had flourished in the Soviet system. He entered an army-sponsored club at kindergarten age and, by 9, he was put into a school with other swimmers and was given training lessons twice a day. From 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., six days a week, he and 44 other swimmers remained together, taking lessons in the pool, in the classroom, in the pool again.</p>
        <p>Twice, Krayzelburg won age-group medals at the national army championships. His coach, Vitaly Ovakimian, told his father: ''Your son can be a great athlete. He was born to be a backstroker.''</p>
        <p>The coach was right, but of course, he could not have known that Krayzelburg's career would take a route far more circuitous than the exhaustive, tedious back and forth of a swimming pool.</p>
        <p>Krayzelburg did become a great athlete, setting world records in the 100-meter and 200-meter backstroke, establishing himself as a multiple gold-medal favorite for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. But he would first have to find a new country that was politically stable and hospitable to his Jewish faith, a new language and a new resolve to succeed in Los Angeles, a place famous for its beaches and water but one that offers few training opportunities for an elite swimmer in the inner city.</p>
        <p>''I've been fortunate enough to learn from my parents about hard work and dedication and committing yourself to a certain thing and following it all the way to the end,'' Krayzelburg said in a recent interview.</p>
        <p>He sat at breakfast, fueling an athletic furnace that burns 5,000 calories a day. At 6 feet 2 inches and 180 pounds, the 24-year-old athlete is movie-star handsome. With slicked-back hair, he is often compared to Pat Riley, the basketball coach and clotheshorse.</p>
        <p>But there is a seriousness about the voice and face of Krayzelburg, a gravity in the squint of his eyes, that more closely resembles the visage of the journalist Eric Sevareid. He has a degree in finance from the University of Southern California, and he speaks in complex terms about his life in the Soviet Union, a life that is infused with tones of gray, not simply black and white.</p>
        <p>''I picked up a lot of good growing up in the Soviet system, training so hard and intense at a young age,'' Krayzelburg said. ''When I got older, I realized they wanted us to train so hard, and to commit to something and to dedicate our whole lives to it, because that's what it took. There are no shortcuts if you want to accomplish something. These are the things I carried on in my career.''</p>
        <p>The late 1980's were a time of opening under the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. According to Krayzelburg, his father, Oleg, who managed a state-owned coffee shop, also had a small, privatized food business. His mother, Yelena, was a bookkeeper at a shoe factory. The army-sponsored school he attended gave him vouchers for free meals. The family lived in a three-bedroom apartment, and even though he had to share a bedroom with his younger sister, Marsha, and relatives sometimes swelled the occupancy to eight people, ''financially, we were above average,'' Lenny said.</p>
        <p>Other concerns, though, would persuade the family to leave for the United States. The Soviet Union had also been engaged in a protracted war in Afghanistan, and Krayzelburg's parents worried that Lenny would be called into some dangerous conflict when he turned 18. His parents also worried about anti-Semitism that carried well beyond name-calling in the schoolyard.</p>
        <p>''We decided to leave; we wanted a better life for our kids,'' Yelena Krayzelburg said. ''We saw the discrimination around us. If Russian kid wants to go to university, they cut the number of Jewish kids getting higher education. When you fill out an application for a job, and they ask for your nationality and they find out you are Jewish, they try not to hire you.</p>
        <p>''And there was the army. At that time, it was the Afghanistan war, something very scary. We were afraid about Lenny.''</p>
        <p>The family applied for immigration, and in December of 1988, when Lenny was 13 and the Eastern bloc was a year from collapse, the Krayzelburgs departed for the new world, first to Vienna, then Rome, finally arriving in West Hollywood, Calif., on March 14, 1989. The family lived briefly with friends who sponsored them, then found their own place. English was elusive, money was tight. Oleg Krayzelburg took a job as a cook in a Russian restaurant, and Yelena found employment at a pharmacy. For Lenny, life in the United States was exciting, jarring. His father insisted that he continue his swimming career. But where?</p>
        <p>There were plenty of pools in Pasadena, and out in the San Fernando Valley, or down in Orange County, but few in urban Los Angeles. There was not even a swim team at Fairfax High, which he attended. For a year, Krayzelburg took a 50-minute bus ride each way to train at Santa Monica City College. He could swim only once a day, not twice as he had done in Odessa, and the ennui of insufficient training and public transportation sapped his conditioning, draining his desire to continue in the sport.</p>
        <p>Bored, he wanted to quit. ''This would be a bad thing to do,'' his father told him. ''You put in so many years in Russia.''</p>
        <p>Seeking to train closer to his home, Krayzelburg settled on the Westside Jewish Community Center, which had a 25-yard indoor pool, half the size of an Olympic pool. On Fridays, Krayzelburg said, the pool was dedicated to recreational swimmers, so the elite group trained in what amounted to a glorified sauna, 10 to 15 yards long, where the water was about 100 degrees and 3 feet deep and toddlers were taught their first strokes. Still, the center offered him a job working 15 to 20 hours a week as a lifeguard, and he continued to train there through high school.</p>
        <p>''I rejuvenated myself at Westside,'' Krayzelburg said. But he could train only 90 minutes a day, four days a week. ''I saw no potential,'' he said. ''I knew what I had done in Russia. It would be impossible to accomplish something like that here.''</p>
        <p>During the spring of 1993, his senior year in high school, Krayzelburg went to Santa Monica City College, where he had first trained, to pre-enroll for classes the next fall. He stopped by the office of the swim coach, Stu Blumkin, who offered to let him train there in the morning, before his classes at Fairfax High. But, Blumkin thought to himself: ''Fairfax doesn't even have a swim team. How fast could this kid be?''</p>
        <p>A year later, he would know.</p>
        <p>Despite working 30 hours a week at the West Hollywood Recreation Department, Krayzelburg won the 1994 California state junior college championship in the 100- and 200-yard backstroke, setting a national junior college record in the 200. Several months earlier, Blumkin said, he wrote a note to himself, sealed it in an envelope and had a friend sign it for authentication. ''He'll be one of the best swimmers in the world,'' Blumkin wrote.</p>
        <p>Just before that 1994 junior college meet, Blumkin called Mark Schubert, who coaches swimming at U.S.C. and will be the 2000 Olympic men's coach. ''I have this backstroker who's going to win the state championship next week,'' Blumkin said. ''I'd like to bring him in and meet you.''</p>
        <p>Schubert got plenty of these calls. ''Yeah, yeah,'' he thought. But Krayzelburg did win the state meet and, later that summer, he shaved nine seconds off his personal best in the 200-meter backstroke. Schubert offered him a scholarship to U.S.C. ''You've got the tools,'' Schubert told the swimmer. ''If you're willing to work, you can be the best in the world.''</p>
        <p>Krayzelburg and his family became United States citizens in 1995, and a year later he finished fifth in the 200-meter backstroke at the 1996 Olympic trials. Now he owns 6 of the 10 fastest times in the event, including the world record of 1 minute 55.87 seconds, as well as the world mark at 100 meters in 53.60. He is a heavy favorite to win both events in Sydney. Blumkin has since opened his sealed forecast of Krayzelburg's greatness, which makes him the Karnak the Magnificent of the swimming set.</p>
        <p>''At the track, if you watch a horse walk, you won't see anything special,'' Blumkin said. ''But the minute you see him gallop, you know. Like the jockeys always say, 'The horse has his mind on business.' That's Lenny. First one in the pool, last one out. Same thing in the weight room. He pushes everyone else up another level.''</p>
