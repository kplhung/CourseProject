        <p>Community gadflies, veteran city employees, stalwart advocates and weary reporters have all been known to fight over it. Now, they have a new edition to chase.</p>
        <p>Last month, 36,000 copies of The Green Book 2000-2001: The Official Directory of the City of New York, arrived from the printer.</p>
        <p>Not a moment too soon. It is supposed to be issued annually, but the city has missed two editions in the last three years. The Department of Citywide Administrative Services, the publisher, decided to forgo a  1999-2000 edition when the 1998-99 edition was delayed until January 1999. ''We didn't want to put out two books in a calendar year,'' said Denise Collins, a spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>The Green Book contains the names, titles, telephone numbers and, in a few cases, e-mail addresses of nearly 7,200 public servants. Most work for the city, but there are  state and federal listings, too.</p>
        <p>The book is also a trove of facts about government (the city has 248,000 full-time employees), and assorted factoids (the Sanitation Department has a deputy director of composting).</p>
        <p>''For someone who works with city government, it has saved me countless hours and days,'' said Neal Rosenstein, the government-reform coordinator at the New York Public Interest Research Group.</p>
        <p>He has stamped ''Return to Neal'' on its cover, but added, ''Sometimes it disappears for over a month.''</p>
        <p>The new edition features the Yankees logo on the cover, to commemorate the team's 25th World Series Championship last fall.  The volume costs $15 and is available by calling (212) 669-8246 or at the CityStore at 1 Centre Street near City Hall or the Times Square Visitors Center on Broadway between 46th and 47th Streets.</p>
        <p>City officials have discussed putting the directory on the city's basic Web site, www.nyclink.org, since at least 1997. Plans now call for testing the book on the city's Intranet later this year before putting it on the Web, said Allan H. Dobrin, commissioner of the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications.</p>
        <p>An abbreviated version of the book has been available on the public advocate's Web site (www.pubadvocate.nyc.gov) since 1995.</p>
        <p>New York is ahead of some cities and behind others when it comes to municipal directories. Washington, Chicago and Boston have neither printed nor online guides, while Miami, Seattle, San Francisco and Philadelphia have abandoned their print version for the Internet. But Los Angeles has a complete directory both in print and on the Web, and is proud of it.</p>
        <p>''Los Angeles is leading the way as the capital city for the 21st century,'' said Frank Mateljan, a press aide to Mayor Richard J. Riordan.</p>
