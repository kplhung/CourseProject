        <p>Re ''Parents Try to Reclaim Their Children's Time'' (news article, June 13):</p>
        <p>Three cheers for the parents of Wayzata, Minn., for trying to cut back on their children's activities. Having dinner together as a family is vitally important, not just so parents can get to know their children but so children can get to know their parents.</p>
        <p>Equally important, and not mentioned, is the importance of unscheduled time for children to learn to entertain themselves. Imaginary games, building with blocks or reading a book for pleasure -- not soccer -- will create more balanced and successful adults.</p>
