        <p>The mutual fund industry missed a shot at new-economy glamour last week.</p>
        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had approved a request by Yahoo, the Internet portal company, not to be regulated as a fund; such regulation would have put the company, which has a market capitalization of $76.57 billion, under tight investment restrictions.</p>
        <p>The issue arose because the S.E.C. defines an ''investment company,'' as a fund is known in legalese, as one that is primarily engaged in owning, holding, trading or investing in securities, and which owns or proposes to buy securities with a value of more than 40 percent of its total assets.</p>
        <p>That sounds rather like what Yahoo does, given its myriad investments in  other companies. So in February, Yahoo applied to the S.E.C. for an exemption from the Investment Company Act, under which funds are regulated.</p>
        <p>The company said in its application that it is not primarily involved in the kind of  activities described by the law. Yahoo  explained that it makes small, noncontrolling investments in companies that complement its Internet and new-media businesses, carrying the investments on its balance sheet as long-term assets.</p>
