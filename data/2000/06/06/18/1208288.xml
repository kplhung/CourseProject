        <p>THESE are heady times for motorcycle enthusiasts. Not only has the weather turned perfect for riding, but the thriving industry is serving up a host of new models.</p>
        <p>For 2000, manufacturers are offering more advanced technology, extra power, better brakes (even antilock brakes, like those in cars), longer warranties and emergency road service.</p>
        <p>Here are some highlights of the motorcycle market this season:</p>
        <p>APRILIA -- This maker of high-style, high-technology Italian motorcycles has been in the American market for only a year or so. It offers three distinct models, the RSV Mille, a 1,000-cubic-centimeter V-twin ($13,799), the SL 1000 Falco V-twin 1,000 cc sport bike ($11,299) and the Pegaso 650 cc single-cylinder street bike ($7,877) with the dual-purpose on- and off-road look so popular in Europe. Aprilia already has about 70 dealerships in the United States, and it recently signed an agreement to acquire another Italian motorcycle giant, Moto Guzzi, which makes large V-twin shaft-drive cruiser, touring and sport bikes.</p>
        <p>BUELL -- The Buell sport bike division of Harley-Davidson has produced its first single-cylinder starter bike, a low-priced, no-frills model called the Blast, a 500 cc high-style street bike that sells for only $4,395 and is aimed at novice riders. In addition, Buell offers the Cyclone ($8,599), the Lightning ($10,599) and the Thunderbolt ($11,999), all using Harley engines of 91 or 101 horsepower.</p>
        <p>BMW -- After a record sales year, BMW has more models than ever, including the new 2001 F 650 GS single-cylinder chain-drive machine that won the Granada-Dakar rally. The F 650 ($8,110 to $8,600) has optional antilock brakes, electronic engine management and a catalytic converter in the exhaust system -- technologies found on no other single-cylinder bike. Also new for 2000 is the R 1150 GS on- and off-road bike ($14,190), a traditional BMW opposed-twin machine with high-mounted front and rear fenders, two asymmetrical headlamps and a three-way-adjustable windscreen.</p>
        <p>CAGIVA -- The company owns the Cagiva and MV Agusta street bike brands and the Swedish Husqvarna dirt-bike line. Cagiva's Grand Canyon ($8,995) uses a 904 cc V-twin Ducati engine -- the company used to own Ducati -- and electronic fuel injection in a half-fairing body that's part off-road bike, part street bike and part pack mule. The limited-production MV Agusta 750 F4 Strada ($18,895) is the company's technological tour de force, a four-cylinder race bike for the street with highly stylized headlamps and a Ferrari-designed radial-valve engine.</p>
        <p>DUCATI -- The vaunted Italian company tried something new on Jan. 1: an Internet sale of the 900 cc MH900e -- the letters stand for Mike Hailwood Evolution. Designed to look like the bike that Hailwood, a world champion, rode in his heyday, it was sold only online, starting at one second after midnight. All 500 were sold in a few minutes. The Ducati product line continues unchanged for 2000: the Monster 750 ($6,995) and 900 ($10,495); the Supersport 750 ($8,295) and 900 ($10,995); the ST2 and ST4 touring bikes ($12,495 and $14,695); the 748 ($12,495); and the new 996, replacing the legendary 916, at $16,495 for the standard and $20,995 for the S version.</p>
        <p>EXCELSIOR-HENDERSON -- The company, based in Belle Plaine, Minn., started and finished in 1999, declaring Chapter 11 bankruptcy late in the year. Excelsior-Henderson has been rescued by new investors who formed a new company, E-H Partners. Production is restarting, and a new model of the Super X V-twin cruiser, with a new front suspension,  has already been shown.</p>
        <p>HARLEY-DAVIDSON -- The company's most significant news for 2000 is that it has passed Honda as the leading seller of motorcycles in the United States (based on sales for the 1999 calendar year). Then there's the new 88-cubic-inch ''Fathead'' engine that, with its internal balancing system, has virtually eliminated the characteristic rolling vibrations inherent in Harley's big-engine bikes. The new engine was introduced late in the last riding season to rave reviews.  Among the new models for 2000 is the Softail Deuce ($15,995) with stacked exhaust pipes, a stretched fuel tank, new fender designs, bigger brakes and a chromed front suspension.</p>
        <p>HONDA -- For 2000, Honda has introduced two high-performance motorcycles, the CBR929RR and the RC51, each with completely different designs. The CBR929RR ($9,999) is a 150-horsepower in-line four-cylinder sport bike that weighs only 379 pounds. The RC51 (also $9,999) is a 125-horsepower 999 cc V-twin that, while completely street-legal, is made for A.M.A. Superbike racing. On the touring/cruising side of the house, Honda has a new Shadow Sabre, a 1,100 cc liquid-cooled V-twin cruiser bike starting at $8,199 for basic black.</p>
        <p>INDIAN -- The 2000 Indian Chief ($23,995), a new motorcycle design faithful to the original Indian last produced in 1953, has fully valanced front and rear fenders, an Indian-head running lamp on the front fender and retro logos. The design is wrapped around an 88-cubic-inch Harley engine refitted by S &amp; S, the aftermarket engine builder. Later this year, a new Indian Scout model will be introduced, and shortly after that Indian expects to produce its own V-twin engines.</p>
        <p>KAWASAKI -- The company has just introduced the Ninja ZX-12R, the quickest and fastest motorcycle it has ever built, limited to a top speed of 185 m.p.h. The 1,200 cc ZX-12R is joined by a new 900 cc ZX-9R Ninja, a new 600 cc Ninja ZX-6R, and three new cruiser bikes. Cruisers are led by a new Vulcan 1500 Nomad with electronic fuel injection, saddle bags and a windshield; a Vulcan 1500 Classic, also with fuel injection; and the Vulcan 800 Drifter, an 800 cc version of Kawasaki's 1940's retro cruiser, which is also available with a 1,500 cc engine.</p>
        <p>MOTO GUZZI -- Aside from its acquisition by Aprilia, Moto Guzzi has a wider array of its transverse V-twin, shaft-drive bikes. Built around a 1,064 cc engine and a five-speed transmission are the California Jackal ($8,495), the California Special ($11,700), which packs a good deal more chrome, and the 90-horsepower V11 Sport ($11,900).</p>
        <p>MZ -- Germany's MZ makes a full line of lightweight bikes wrapped around a monster Yamaha XTZ 660 cc single-cylinder engine and an unusual large-tubing frame. The line includes the on- and off-road Black Panther ($6,195), the bare-bones Tour ($4,995), the Skorpion full-bodied sportbike ($5,795) and the Skorpion Traveller touring bike with saddle bags and windshield ($6,495).</p>
        <p>SUZUKI -- With several 1999 racing championships to its credit, along with the 1,300 cc Hayabusa -- the quickest and fastest production motorcycle in the world -- Suzuki goes into the 2000 riding season with a wide array of machinery, including the all-new GSX-R750 race bike replica and the bargain-priced ($5,749) SV650. The Hayabusa ($10,799), perhaps the biggest high-performance bargain on earth -- car or bike -- is available in slightly less garish colors for 2000. It is not quite as quick or as fast as the 1999 model, which was clocked at 194 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>TRIUMPH -- The last survivor of the once-dominant British motorcycle manufacturers, Triumph has thrived in the American market over the last five years. For 2000, there are two brand new models. The first is the TT600, a lightweight, 600 cc four-cylinder machine in a stunning black and yellow or red and silver aimed directly at the Japanese 600's. It is joined by an all-new Sprint RS, using Triumph's proven 955 cc three-cylinder engine in a lightweight machine with a half fairing and exposed engine.</p>
        <p>VICTORY -- In only its third year as a motorcycle manufacturer, Victory now has two 1,500 cc cruisers, the original V92C and the new V92SC, distinguished by its bobbed fenders and very large chrome muffler on the right side. (The original has twin pipes and mufflers.) The standard cruiser, updated for 2000 with more power and a better-sounding exhaust system, retails for $13,399, the SC for $13,999. Victory plans a whole series of factory-sponsored touring and cruising rides for Victory owners in 2001.</p>
        <p>YAMAHA -- After nearly 50 years of cooperation on engines and research, Toyota bought 5 percent of Yamaha, Japan's second-largest motorcycle manufacturer, earlier this year; in turn, the Yamaha Corporation and Yamaha Motors each bought 500,000 shares of Toyota. Yamaha's 2000 product line is led by the lighter, stronger, better-handling 1,000 cc YZF-R1 performance bike, with a new chassis and a new 150-horsepower engine, for $10,299. On the cruiser side, there's a new Venture MM Limited 1,300 cc V-4 ($16,099), a loaded cruiser with special cream paint and limited-edition dress.</p>
