        <p>IT is easy to whip up enthusiasm for Scarborough Fair. The many small dining spaces make eating here seem like a private affair, from the patio and glittery little bar at the entry to the cozy nooks of the main room to the flower-decked, vest-pocket courtyard, reminiscent of the half-hidden back gardens one glimpses from the side streets in Italy.</p>
        <p>At the prices charged here, however, atmosphere might not be enough. Although the cheerful waitress was a trooper, pacing was off -- no mystery if the only waitress in the room is also tending the bar. And some dishes seemed slap-dash, as though the kitchen didn't bother planning beyond a main ingredient and a bed of fresh leafy greens.</p>

        <p>IT is easy to whip up enthusiasm for Scarborough Fair. The many small dining spaces make eating here seem like a private affair, from the patio and glittery little bar at the entry to the cozy nooks of the main room to the flower-decked, vest-pocket courtyard, reminiscent of the half-hidden back gardens one glimpses from the side streets in Italy.</p>
        <p>At the prices charged here, however, atmosphere might not be enough. Although the cheerful waitress was a trooper, pacing was off -- no mystery if the only waitress in the room is also tending the bar. And some dishes seemed slap-dash, as though the kitchen didn't bother planning beyond a main ingredient and a bed of fresh leafy greens.</p>
        <p>That being said, a clever presentation of chicken tempura cradled in loose arugula leaves recalled the old chicken-in-a-basket. But Scarborough's tempura was light and almost as crackly as the Japanese prototype. And in architectural presentation, two delectable spring rolls, like fat cigars, came with ginger, avocado and salsa dips.</p>
        <p>Balanced on an artfully folded napkin, a bowl of plain carrot soup (no cream) proved that sometimes the basics can't be beat. But decent crab cake (plural on the menu) under a pile of frisee came with sharp, soupy remoulade better served separately; and the ''salad'' part of Shrimp Martini Salad seemed forgotten. What arrived was a bleak presentation: five medium shrimps hanging on to the rim of a martini glass filled, nonetheless, with excellent, complex tomato dip.</p>
        <p>Smoked Trout Caesar Salad had lots of smoky flavor but only scraps of trout. While a disclaimer explained that seasonal availability would prevail and, therefore, not all ingredients listed on the menu might be used, we did expect to find the main ingredient, in this case a recognizable piece of fish. We also wondered at the absence of seasonal ingredients, like the variety of vegetables now spilling over in market bins.</p>
        <p>Long wedges of seared peppered tuna topped layers of tender sauteed leek and a small portion of gnocchi in wild mushroom sauce -- a delicious combination. Pieces of lobster garnished mashed potatoes and a square of striped bass; and shrimp primavera brought assorted vegetables on a pleasant tangle of angel hair, done perfectly. But Scarborough sushi proved a disappointing effort of a few rolls of dried seaweed with chokingly sticky rice and a couple of strips of grilled salmon.</p>
        <p>Although the texture was loose, two medallions of flavorful beef were served on a bed of fresh arugula. But mushy stewed plums did little to enhance a generous helping of crispy-skinned duck.</p>
        <p>Swordfish stuffed with leek, mozzarella and shiitake sounded tempting but yielded little flavor, and papery skins of leek, like the dry outer skin of an onion, mixed with slices of the vegetable itself, making parts of the dish inedible.</p>
        <p>Someone put a great deal of work into the dessert fruit platter. Raspberries, strawberries and, cut to bite-size portions, oranges, peaches and apples were beautifully arranged and crowned with a chunk of Stilton.  Excellent honey biscuits came stacked like a strawberry shortcake; more cookie than biscuit, the tower was nonetheless a classic -- whipped cream, berries and all. Those sweet strawberries with vanilla ice cream made another winner, even though promised Grand Marnier was undetectable. Heavy with luscious slices of fruit, apple and pear tart was nicely produced on one try, but it was soggy and overwhelmed with almond flavoring on another. Skip oily and intensely orangey creme brulee.</p>
        <p>A three-course dinner averages $41 without drinks, tax and tip. The restaurant occupies the rear of the corner building. Enter from Garden Avenue.</p>
