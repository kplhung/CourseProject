        <p>Julia Percevault-Venegas,  Chula Vista,  Calif., April 2000</p>
        <p>''I was house shopping. My husband and I had separated, so we sold our other house. I was very sad and tense -- it had been very sudden, after 33 years of marriage. There were too many decisions to be made, all by me. It just seemed so overwhelming. I haven't decided if I want to change my last name or keep it. Everything is difficult. The Realtor thought it was a great house. I didn't like it. There's always something personal about a house: you have your own start and your own life in it. In the bathroom, I grabbed my stomach and told myself I really need to lose weight. It's kind of reflexive. I don't really enjoy looking at myself in the mirror. I try to avoid them at all costs. But there is hope. Eventually I will feel very comfortable making decisions all by myself. I feel it now. But I don't think there was hope that day yet.''</p>
