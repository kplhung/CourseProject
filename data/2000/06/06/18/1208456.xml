        <p>In what looks to many here like a twilight struggle over the future of free speech, the Kremlin has handed one journalist over to Chechen guerrillas, demanded that newspapers obtain federal licenses and, on Tuesday, slapped Russia's leading press baron in a notoriously lice-ridden prison.</p>
        <p>But the litmus test of the Kremlin's intentions may be whether it tries to crack down on a bunch of grotesque, legless latex dolls.</p>
        <p>The dolls -- a jug-eared, sheep-eyed President Vladimir V. Putin; his Rasputinesque staff chief, Aleksandr Voloshin; dead-on renditions of balding Communists, woolly-headed right-wingers and other famous rogues -- are the cast of ''Kukly,'' which wrapped up its weekly filming late Thursday on a ramshackle sound stage near the Moscow River.</p>
        <p>''Kukly'' is political satire. But that is like calling an ermine a rodent. By turns vicious, obscene, hilarious and knowing, it has long been the most popular television show in Russia. At 10 p.m. on any given Sunday, more than half the nation's sets are riveted on the program.</p>
        <p>No one would be surprised to see that share jump even higher this Sunday. Because the press baron whom the Kremlin jailed this week, Vladimir A. Gusinsky, owns the NTV television network that produces ''Kukly.''</p>
        <p>And there is a growing sense -- not least among the program's staff -- that the the rubbery stars are on a collision course with whoever actually holds power inside the Kremlin.</p>
        <p>''We want to find the limits of freedom of expression here, and show those limits to others,'' Grigory Petrovich Lyubomirov, a writer and director of the program, said between breaks in filming. ''Because we have something to lose.''</p>
        <p>''We've lived 10 years under conditions of freedom here. And I don't want to turn back to what was.''</p>
        <p>''Kukly'' regularly tests those limits. American television may be saturated with sex and violence, but it is doubtful that New York's corporate suits would swallow hard enough to broadcast some of the program's most memorable political jabs.</p>
        <p>One, broadcast last winter, was built around a drive by Mr. Putin's puppet down Moscow's glitziest avenue, Tverskaya Street, where he rated major politicians. Tame enough -- except that the drive began at Russia's Parliament, shown as a high-class bawdy house, and the street politicians Mr. Putin's puppet was rating were cast as cheap prostitutes bidding to join the orgy that was his presidential bandwagon.</p>
        <p>''Kukly's'' account of the politicians' charms, from sadomasochism to virginity, cannot be fully described, at least not in this space. But any Russian who saw the program knew precisely what was meant.</p>
        <p>A famous ''Kukly'' from 1995 skewered the government's new $10-a-month minimum wage by casting former President Boris N. Yeltsin and his prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, as drunken street bums, sifting through trash to survive.</p>
        <p>Other episodes have cast top political figures as criminals on a Siberian prison train and tell-all guests in a Russian version of a Ruth Westheimer sex show. Mr. Putin was cast early as a surgeon on the Russian body politic, armed with hatchet and blowtorch. He was reportedly infuriated when the program adapted a German fairy tale to depict him as a self-indulgent, tantrum-throwing infant.</p>
        <p>Such slights might be more easily borne were the effect not enhanced, sometimes outlandishly, by the puppets, which are made in France from sculpted caricatures. The amazingly lifelike dolls are usually operated by two actors, each of whom contributes an arm while dividing mouth movements, blinking and other tasks between them.</p>
        <p>It is no surprise that ''Kukly'' has been in hot water before.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lyubomirov, a ponytailed, 46-year-old philosopher who attended the same St. Petersburg university as Mr. Putin, said producers used to get calls from Mr. Yeltsin's wife and daughters -- asking not for gentle political treatment, but instead that the president not be depicted as so feeble.</p>
        <p>The truth is less generous to Mr. Yeltsin: his chief prosecutor began a criminal inquiry into ''Kukly'' in 1995 after the street-bum episode, citing a law barring insulting portrayals of senior government officials.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Lyubomirov said, little from the Yeltsin era has approached the pressure ''Kukly'' has experienced since Mr. Putin came to high office, as prime minister, last August.</p>
        <p>''Things changed dramatically,'' he said. ''There were no requests for physical changes. But we've received threats from his political family -- not threats to close the program but that the program may have some 'difficulties.' And this Russian phrase, 'to have difficulties,' can mean many things.''</p>
        <p>The threats peaked this March in a private conversation between a senior Kremlin official and a top executive at NTV. Yevgeny Kiselyev, the network's general director, said the official proffered a list of tasks the network would have to meet to escape the government's wrath, including less skeptical political coverage and toned-down reporting on the war in Chechnya. ''One of those demands was to get Mr. Putin's look-alike -- his rubber look-alike, that is -- off the 'Kukly' show,'' Mr. Kiselyev said in an interview.</p>
        <p>''Kukly'' responded last month in classic fashion. The program told the biblical story of the Israelites' trek through the wilderness and their salvation by Moses, who led them to the holy land on God's instruction.</p>
        <p>In this case, the Israelites were an assortment of Kremlin politicians, and Moses -- once more Mr. Putin's right-hand aide Mr. Voloshin -- returned from the mountain with a series of curious commandments. One, ''Thou shalt not kill,'' was amended to exclude killings in outhouses -- an allusion to Mr. Putin's crude threat last year to wipe out Chechen militants, even in the toilet. ''Thou shalt not steal'' was altered to permit petty theft after the Israelite politicians complained bitterly about the restriction.</p>
        <p>As for the deity himself, he was so terrible that no one could look upon him or even speak his name. However, Mr. Voloshin said, ''You can call him 'Lord God,' or, for short, the Russian initials for the term: G.B.''</p>
        <p>Nobody missed the fact that ''G.B.'' can also be short for ''K.G.B.,'' Mr. Putin's old employer as well as the specter of totalitarian control that critics now accuse him of resurrecting.</p>
        <p>''We decided to respond in a way that was easy -- to show that we're not working with rubber puppets, but with public stereotypes and misconceptions,'' Mr. Lyubomirov said. ''If we want, we can not show people. But we can set up everything so that everyone understands what we are talking about.''</p>
        <p>It is a talent honed by decades of practice under Soviet rule, where even the tamest observation had to be made obliquely. As the episode filmed on Thursday showed, this is not the show's customary style.</p>
        <p>The program to be broadcast this Sunday night was conceived on Monday as a satire on Russia's desire to present a modern face to the world. After President Clinton leaves this month's Moscow summit meeting covered with rotten tomato pulp -- 'Drop dead, you limb of Satan!' one legislator cries after him -- Mr. Putin decides that Russia needs a new, modern image.</p>
        <p>He summons the state painter -- his aide, Mr. Voloshin -- to produce a portrait of civility: a reproduction of a famous turn-of-the-century painting, ''Meeting of the State Council,'' which depicts the czar and his advisers in great-coated splendor. Much of the humor turns on the efforts of politicians, from the former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to Mr.  Yeltsin's discredited liberal aides, to position themselves in the updated portrait around Mr. Putin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Voloshin, widely regarded as an architect of the Kremlin's crackdown on dissent, plays the heavy as an artist with grand designs for Kremlin power.</p>
        <p>''It's important that everybody see the true and wonderful face of our statehood, that we do not abjure new ideas,'' Mr. Putin says at one point in the skit. ''We are not Zulus of some sort. We have opposition, too.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Voloshin replies: ''Of course, your majesty! Even two oppositions: the left and the right. Just say how many of them you want, and you'll have them.''</p>
        <p>That was the story, anyway, until the NTV chairman, Mr. Gusinsky, was jailed on Tuesday evening. Now the episode ends with a twist: the characters find themselves wearing not greatcoats but prison uniforms reminiscent of Stalin's purges.</p>
        <p>By the end, an iron curtain descends across the stage -- an unsubtle allusion not just to the fact that state repression falls on both great and small, but that it also cuts Russia off from the civilized world the Putin puppet professes to admire.</p>
        <p>The very fact that ''Kukly'' can broadcast such heresy on national television, of course, is evidence that freedom of speech lives here, something Mr. Lyubomirov freely allows.</p>
        <p>The question, he says, is not whether, but for how long.</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying we don't have freedom of speech. I'm saying that the field of that freedom is being narrowed. There are fewer and fewer who can speak the truth. And maybe ours is one of the last.''</p>
