        <p>BY my watch, it took six minutes from the time I entered Molly Jong-Fast's book party at the Harmonie Club for sour grapes to sprout.

        <p>BY my watch, it took six minutes from the time I entered Molly Jong-Fast's book party at the Harmonie Club for sour grapes to sprout. A young man, bound for law school, announced that he would rather publish a novel, too. ''If it were this easy for me, I would write,'' he said churlishly, taking in the photographers snapping shots of Ms. Jong-Fast with her mother, the novelist Erica Jong, hovering and smiling nearby.</p>
        <p>Now, now, boys and girls, play nice. Having a famous mommy, a famous daddy (the novelist Jonathan Fast) and a famous grandpa (the novelist Howard Fast) doesn't mean it's always rosy for the offspring. As Ms. Jong-Fast writes in her first novel, ''Normal Girl,'' (Villard), ''The children of famous people are a bit like Communism, better in concept than in practice.'' But in our celebrity worshiping culture, not to mention this attention-grubbing city, envy is stuck on automatic pilot.</p>
        <p>Yes, ''Normal Girl'' has been published at the author's tender age of 21. While that is a rather stunning achievement, it seems somehow in keeping with the fact that Ms. Jong-Fast has lived much of her brief life in fast forward. Her parents were divorced when she was 4, and she and her mother moved to Manhattan from Connecticut. Ms. Jong-Fast went to Dalton until she was asked to leave in the third grade, after testing dyslexic. She transferred to the Day School, where her academic life improved, but by the time she was 13, she was close to 200 pounds and bulimic. At 16, she was drinking three vodka martinis at a clip, and after graduating from Riverdale, she shot through stints at Wesleyan, Barnard and New York University, supplementing her cocktail of choice with cocaine and valium. By 19, she was at Hazelden.</p>
        <p>Her novel, unsurprisingly, is about a seen-it-all girl who ends up in rehab. ''It's such a cliche, it's gross,'' Ms. Jong-Fast groaned a few days after the party. She was seated at an outside table at the Barking Dog Luncheonette on Third Avenue at 94th Street, even though the temperature was in the 90's. She wanted to smoke.</p>
        <p>''If I weren't me, I would hate me, too,'' she went on agreeably, lighting up. ''I know the perception is I'm this princess who gets advantages and is so privileged. I had a really hard time making the character in my book sympathetic. Children in Sarajevo are sympathetic already. Rich Jewish kids from the Upper East Side aren't.''</p>
        <p>Besides being a coming-of-age story, ''Normal Girl'' is the latest entry in the fast-lane, club-kids genre that has included ''Bright Lights, Big City,'' ''Story of My Life'' and ''Slaves of New York.'' Ms. Jong-Fast sums up contemporary New York City when she writes: ''Nothing ever really changes. . . . Maybe disco has become techno, promiscuous sex has morphed into cautious promiscuous sex and cell phones have replaced religion as the opiate of the masses, but our relentless obsession with The Next Big Thing-ism (T.N.B.T.-ism) remains the same.''</p>
        <p>The irony that Ms. Jong-Fast's book is being pushed as T.N.B.T. does not escape her. Neither does the fact that people assume the novel's heroine -- who takes heroin -- is the author herself. Her book's title is satirical. ''Everybody thinks their reality is normal,'' she said, even teenagers who call funerals ''the cotillions of the 90's'' and wear Prada boots in summer.</p>
        <p>Sober and drug-free for two and a half years, she is looking to define a different ''normal.'' To that end, she is forsaking what she calls the ''Madison Avenue Mafia,'' a group that she describes in her book as having one guiding principle: ''No matter how large the nose or how bad the birthmark, whatever it is, it'll look better waxed, tweezed, trained, starved and squeezed into a miniskirt.''</p>
        <p>So, she continues to teeter between childhood and adulthood, celebrity and privacy. For starters, this supposedly hard-partying girl lives in the same Upper East Side high-rise as her mother and stepfather, Ken Burrows. ''The shtetl mentality,'' she said wryly.</p>
        <p>It is one of her many contradictions. Ms. Jong-Fast walks with a confident stride while simultaneously ducking her head, almost in apology, which turns the overall effect into something of a reluctant lope. She approached the podium at her book party muttering, ''I'm going to trip,'' but instead she took the mike, dithered just enough to seem like a kid, then saved herself gracefully.</p>
        <p>In her lunchtime conversation, she makes wise statements about her feelings, then giggles and calls herself silly. She claims her childhood ambition was to be a junkie. ''My yearbook quote was, ''Dream: Coke. Reality: Diet Coke,'' she said. ''I grew up reading 'Less Than Zero,' and I thought taking drugs was so glamorous. It's something the New York media still perpetuates, with all those stories about clubs.''</p>
        <p>Did she find it glamorous? ''It was expensive, and I was really sick all the time and always in a bad mood,'' she said. ''And I had nose bleeds 24 hours a day. I always felt I was missing things before, a better party, some list, some club. Now, I want to miss everything. I read about it in the Post and feel happy I wasn't there. I think growing up here you get an inflated idea of how important you are. When I was at Hazelden, no one knew anything about me or who Erica Jong was. It wasn't important. I realized the world is much bigger than New York City. All this stuff doesn't mean anything.''</p>
        <p>A strong wind scattered cigarette ashes over the table. ''It's going to be appealing to eat here,'' Ms. Jong-Fast said, suddenly self-conscious, trying to brush them off. She made rapid small talk about her dog, eager to be liked. Though her painstakingly made-up face stayed composed, her chest stained pink with anxiety under her V-neck dress.</p>
        <p>She left N.Y.U. when she started writing ''Normal Girl'' at 19, which went through many revisions. ''My editor, Mollie Doyle, was tough on me,'' she said. ''I needed someone to tell me to stop it. I was so profound, writing about the meaning of life. She told me to write like I speak. I'm happy with it now. It feels like me.''</p>
        <p>The book was well-received in London; early reviews here have been mixed. ''None of the reviews were as bad as the ones I wrote in my head,'' she said. ''The important thing was that I was able to find my own voice and be my own person. I got to it by doing what my parents had done, but I got to it. I'm very clear on the fact that I'm not my mother.</p>
        <p>''But I did grow up with a lot of pressure,'' she continued. ''In my family, the only way to get attention was to talk with them about what they wanted to talk about. They were obsessed with publishers, editors, agents. Everyone in my family was so accomplished, I was sort of afraid to do anything. I'd lose by default. I realize now it's O.K. to do something and not do it perfectly.''</p>
        <p>It helps that she has not read her mother's books. ''I grew up idolizing her,'' she said. ''She always seemed so exciting. She would sweep into the house with duty-free presents wearing good-looking clothing, speaking Italian, and she was so beautiful. Last year, my stepfather had a heart aneurysm, and I got to see my mother as a real human being with doubts and failures. It was amazing. I realized she was weak and intrinsically flawed. I hadn't wanted to see that before.'' She smiled tentatively, and you could suddenly see the oddity of being the child of celebrity: All children grow up idolizing their parents, but with a famous person, everyone else joins in.</p>
        <p>''If I had a choice of normal parents and a two-car garage, no, I wouldn't have wanted it,'' she said. ''I wouldn't have been able to suspend disbelief to write a novel, if I hadn't grown up this way. It made me who I was. Yes, I did a lot of weird stuff. But I got to live two lives in one lifetime. When I wrote the book, I interviewed heroin and crack addicts, because I'm not as brave as my character. I would be at an after-hours club, thinking I'm so cool with my emergency $20 in the bottom of my handbag.''</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Jong-Fast said she might go back to school, she is currently writing a collection of satirical essays about dating in New York. ''The best part of the whole book thing is my parents being so blown away by me,'' she said happily.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jong, reached by phone, said she was impressed by her daughter's willingness to compete in her world, because she had avoided a similar situation herself. ''My mother and grandfather were both painters,'' she said, ''and I ran away from it, because I didn't want to compete with them and the family racket. I hadn't the guts to take my mother on directly.''</p>
        <p>Her daughter, apparently, learned different lessons. ''I know my mom supports me,'' Ms. Jong-Fast said, smiling. ''And I know I can always use her for material.''</p>
