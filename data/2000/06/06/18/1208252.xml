        <p>WHEN the Titanic sank in 1912, Isador Straus, a founder of Macy's, and his wife, Ida, went down with the ship. The song ''The Titanic's Disaster'' paid them tribute. Its sheet music (left) goes on exhibit next Sunday as the Yeshiva University Museum moves to a new site at 15 West 16th Street.</p>
        <p>Six new exhibitions will mark the museum's shift from the Yeshiva campus in Washington Heights to a neighborhood that has developed a strong art scene. The largest show is ''Major Intersections,'' a collection of historical artifacts and texts (including the Titanic sheet music) that reflect a range of Jewish experiences. The other shows are ''David the King,'' paintings by Ivan Schwebel; ''From Tent to Temple: Daily Life in the Ancient Near East,'' for children; ''Noah Summons the Animals: Metal Sculpture by Manuel Bennett''; ''Still Here: The Renaissance of Jewish Life in the Former Soviet Union'' and ''The Sacred Hebrew Letters: Sculpture by Charles M. Stern.''</p>
        <p>Yeshiva University Museum, 15 West 16th Street; opens next Sunday; Sundays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursdays 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., Mondays by appointment; $6 for adults, $4 for students and people 62 or older, under 5 free; (212) 294-8330.</p>
