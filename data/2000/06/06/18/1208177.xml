        <p>AFFLUENT workers willing to pay thousands of dollars for monthly rent have created a brisk high-end apartment market downtown, a turnaround from the mid-1990's, when few people wanted to live in the business district, anchor retailers were leaving and planners feared the city center was becoming blighted.</p>
        <p>Prospective renters began taking ''hard hat'' tours of 276 luxury apartments last month in the final two of four towers that Harbor Properties is building a block from the waterfront.

A courtyard park slopes down the hillside site between First and Western Avenues. One of the new buildings will open in July, the other in November. Both will have 17 stories.</p>

        <p>AFFLUENT workers willing to pay thousands of dollars for monthly rent have created a brisk high-end apartment market downtown, a turnaround from the mid-1990's, when few people wanted to live in the business district, anchor retailers were leaving and planners feared the city center was becoming blighted.</p>
        <p>Prospective renters began taking ''hard hat'' tours of 276 luxury apartments last month in the final two of four towers that Harbor Properties is building a block from the waterfront. The $155.8 million Harbor Steps complex will have a total of 730 apartments, as well as 75,600 square feet of office and retail space. A courtyard park slopes down the hillside site between First and Western Avenues. One of the new buildings will open in July, the other in November. Both will have 17 stories.</p>
        <p>The 454 apartments occupied in the first two towers, each 25 stories, command top dollar for rent -- $955 to $5,000 a month. Harbor Steps boasts 98 percent occupancy and is the only major apartment complex in the central business district, although other apartments have sprung up in Belltown to the north. Residents are close to waterfront restaurants and they can buy groceries at the historic Pike Place Market a block north or browse in the new Seattle Art Museum across First Avenue from the Harbor Steps concierge desk.</p>
        <p>''Apartments are ideal for people who work downtown and can afford to buy homes or condominiums but who may have money invested in other ways and don't need real estate as a tax write-off,'' said Stephen Fina, Harbor Properties marketing director. ''Forty percent of our renters are new to Seattle, often employed in high-tech industries. They follow the job market and may be in Seattle today and Silicon Valley next year.''</p>
        <p>The average age is 44, and the average stay 16 months. There are few school-age children because of the lack of schools downtown. A day-care center will be able to handle up to 60 preschool children when the new towers are completed.</p>
        <p>''In 1994, when we marketed the first tower, we were nervous about how long it would take to rent units,'' Mr. Fina said. ''We were certain downtown living would be highly desirable, but had no idea of the pent-up demand.'' Yet, the apartments in the 25-story tower leased completely within four months. The second 25-story tower opened in July 1997, two years ahead of schedule and was fully rented in two months.</p>
        <p>''The difference on First Avenue is like black and white, due to the number of people now living in this neighborhood,'' said Tim Warner, director of corporate communications at the Immunex Corporation, a biotech company across Western Avenue from Harbor Steps. ''Two and a half years ago, I'd walk down the street at 9 p.m. and the only other people out looked unsavory. But Harbor Steps is making a dramatic impact. Now there are a lot of people out, some in fancy clothes going to the art museum or the symphony at the new Benaroya Hall on Second Avenue.'' Immunex houses new executives in Harbor Steps until they get settled.</p>
        <p>In Seattle's early years, First Avenue was called Front Street, and businesses catered to workers on the docks and industrial buildings and to sailors. In 1953, the elevated Alaskan Way Viaduct was built along the harbor and it discouraged downtown waterfront redevelopment.</p>
        <p>Stimson Bullitt, chairman of Harbor Properties, said he quietly assembled the adjacent properties along First and Western Avenues in 1972 that would become Harbor Steps ''because they looked like good bargains.'' He added: ''They were run-down and many were empty ruins of taverns, pawnshops, tattoo parlors and flophouses. I thought that since this is part of the center of town, the area had a good future.''</p>
        <p>MR. BULLITT, who comes from a prominent founding family in Seattle that had long invested in downtown real estate, said he wanted to create an urban neighborhood with housing and parks to revitalize the waterfront. ''The downtown had a big concentration of office buildings and more were going up in the 1980's and I thought there might be an excess of office space,'' he recalled. ''But a great many jobs were being created downtown and I thought it would be appealing to live within walking distance from work.''</p>
        <p>He chose to build rental apartments rather than condominiums. ''With condos, if you hit the market right when your doors open, you can make a lot of money,'' he said. ''But if the market is not right, you end up with empty buildings and a big debt. With apartments, if the market is not good, you can lower the rent and cover financing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bullitt could not get construction loans at first . ''Bankers just rolled their eyeballs toward the ceiling,'' he said.  ''They'd look at the $5 million cost of the staircase park and ask what revenues I'd get from that and turned me down as a fool.  But after the first building did well, financing was easier.''</p>
        <p>Harbor Steps was coming to market during tough years for Seattle's downtown. In 1992, a department store anchor, Frederick &amp; Nelson, closed at Fifth Avenue and Pine Street and other retailers followed, leaving boarded buildings smeared with graffiti. The business district became a ghost town at night as people avoided the skyscraper canyons out of concerns about safety.</p>
        <p>But when Nordstrom moved its flagship store into the Frederick's building in a $100 million renovation in August 1998, it triggered a stampede of new mixed-use development. Prominent national retailers including Nike, F.A.O. Schwarz, Banana Republic, Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie arrived and the downtown gained a new vibrancy.</p>
        <p>The redevelopment spark also caught on along First Avenue.</p>
        <p>Boutiques like Flora &amp; Henri Children's Clothier have replaced some of the seedier businesses. However, adjacent to Harbor Steps to the north is the Lusty Lady Live Show with a marquee that proclaims, ''Now Showing: Everything.''</p>
        <p>Harbor Steps has become so popular that monthly rents are soaring. In 1994, studios rented for $683 but jumped to $955 in 1998 and to $1,110 today. One-bedroom units leased for $944 in 1994, $1,372 in 1998 and $1,905 today, up 39 percent in two years. Two-bedroom apartments leased for $1,437 originally, $2,098 in 1998 and then rose 28 percent, to $2,680, today. Penthouses cost up to $5,000 today, more than double the $2,227 in 1994.</p>
        <p>Douglas Tenney, a certified public accountant who is the chief financial officer for three companies, moved into Harbor Steps in February. Only studios were available, but residents are allowed first crack at the new apartments under construction. ''I took the hard-hat tour and fell in love with a fifth-floor suite with a balcony overlooking the Harbor Steps plaza and park,'' he said. ''It was so charming I took out my checkbook immediately and made a deposit.'' He will pay $2,400 a month for a one-bedroom apartment and move in in July.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fina, the marketing director, wants to transform the outdoor plaza into a spot where the anticipated 1,100 residents can mingle and linger over carryouts from coffee shops in the complex. Indoors, residents can relax in three spas, work out in the fitness center or basketball court or on the indoor climbing wall, and hold Super Bowl parties in the big-screen theater room. Since many residents have been ordering groceries on the Internet via HomeGrocer.com,  Harbor Steps may set up a refrigerated area where groceries can be delivered while residents work.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, northeast of Nordstrom at the edge of the retail district on Seventh Avenue, Continental-Bentall, a developer, is building Westlake Tower, a 366-unit apartment building. ''It appeals to downtown professionals wanting to give up their commute and be closer to the city's plethora of shopping, dining and entertainment,'' said Claudio Guincher, Continental-Bentall's chief operating officer.''</p>
        <p>Behind Westlake Tower are low-rise buildings ripe for redevelopment. Gary Carpenter, chief operating officer of Bentall U.S., says the downtown's future growth will spread here ''because land is available; we have plans for several other residential properties and are bullish on that whole area.'' Both companies are subsidiaries of the Bentall Corporation of Vancouver, British Columbia.</p>
        <p>Mike Scott a principal of Dupre &amp; Scott Apartment Advisors, which analyzes apartment pricing, said: ''Nobody downtown or in Belltown has been in the same league as Harbor Steps with its high-quality, high-end product, which is as good as rental housing gets in Seattle. Westlake Tower will be its first competition.''</p>
