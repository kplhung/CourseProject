        <p>NEW JERSEY has a long and storied golf history. In fact, it holds the keepers of American golf history, the United States Golf Association's Museum and Library in Far Hills.</p>
        <p>The museum, familiarly called Golf House, holds gloves, clubs and other memorabilia from famous professional golfers like Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Walter Hagen and even such odd golf detritus as the club Alan Shepard used on the Apollo XIV mission to the moon. Golf House, (908) 234-2300, is open to the public from 9 a.m to 5 p.m. weekdays and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekends. Admission is free.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY has a long and storied golf history. In fact, it holds the keepers of American golf history, the United States Golf Association's Museum and Library in Far Hills.</p>
        <p>The museum, familiarly called Golf House, holds gloves, clubs and other memorabilia from famous professional golfers like Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Walter Hagen and even such odd golf detritus as the club Alan Shepard used on the Apollo XIV mission to the moon. Golf House, (908) 234-2300, is open to the public from 9 a.m to 5 p.m. weekdays and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekends. Admission is free.</p>
        <p>New Jersey also has 4 of Golf Digest magazine's top 50 courses, including the  No. 1 course, the main layout at Pine Valley Golf Club in Camden County. Pine Valley, built in 1918 and designed by George Crump, is a course of legend rather than popularity. It has held no major tournaments and doesn't intend to. Nonplaying visitors are allowed on the course only only one day a year, which is determined by club members. In fact, the club is the main portion of the one-square-mile town of Pine Valley, all of whose 19 residents are members of the club. Pine Valley's members over the years have been the elite of the Philadelphia area mixed with some high-level golfing celebrities like Bob Hope.</p>
        <p>Perhaps surprisingly, the communities around it are not elite by any means, but  working-class towns like Clementon, Laurel Springs and Pine Hill. It is not a particularly long course -- a 6,656-yard, par 70 -- but is particularly known for its magnificent sand and grass bunkers and  water hazards on four holes. The fairways are wide and the greens are large and fast, but even the best golfers have been known to card scores well into the 80's.</p>
        <p>The North Jersey counterpart to Pine Valley is Baltusrol, which is 34th among United States courses on the Golf Digest list. Baltusrol, named after Baltus Roll, the farmer of the land in Springfield Township where the course was built, opened in 1895 with 30 members, but the late-19th-century golf craze brought the membership up to 400 by 1898. Over the next seven years, it played host to what were then  golf's three main championships: the United States Women's Amateur, the United States Men's Amateur and the United States Open. In 1912, William Howard Taft became the first president to visit a golf  course at Baltusrol.</p>
        <p>The United States Open returned to Baltusrol in 1915, 1954, 1967, 1980 and 1993 and this year, from Aug. 21 through 27, it will be the site of the 100th United States Men's  Amateur championship.</p>
        <p>Three other New Jersey courses will have professional tour events this summer. The ShopRite Ladies Professional Golf Association Classic will be held at the Marriott Seaview Resort in Atlantic City from June 30 through July 2. The Senior Professional Golf Association tour will visit the state twice: for the Cadillac N.F.L. Golf Classic at Upper Montclair Country Club in Clifton June 23 through 25, and for the Bell Atlantic Classic at the Tournament Players Club at Jasna Polana in Princeton July 21 through 23.</p>
