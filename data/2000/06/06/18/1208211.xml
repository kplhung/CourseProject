        <p>AS a teenager, her contemporaries rocked out to post-punk bands like Green Day and No Doubt, but Jane Monheit, of Oakdale, was hooked on jazz. Now 22, with her debut album, ''Never Never Land,'' just released, Ms. Monheit is being called the jazz vocalist to watch.</p>
        <p>''This is all I ever wanted,'' said the singer who grew up in a family devoted to music. Her grandmother and aunt were opera singers and voice teachers. ''There was always jazz playing in the house,'' she said, ''and my father also listened to folk, bluegrass and classical.</p>
        <p>''Musical theater was also a great influence on me. I certainly took some flak for my musical tastes. I was definitely the weird kid.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Monheit was lucky. Her school district, Connetquot, offered an extensive jazz program starting in elementary school. Inspired by the ''real old-fashioned singers'' like Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Carmen McCrae, she began to pursue her studies with zeal.</p>
        <p>She says she felt destined to be a singer, but she went through stages of wanting to be a marine biologist, actress, writer and ballerina.</p>
        <p>While in high school, where she also played clarinet, she began singing standards and love duets at weddings. ''I had so much fun being a working woman,'' she said.</p>
        <p>It was at Connetquot High School where Ms. Monheit blossomed. ''The district had the greatest music teachers ever,'' she said. ''I never studied with anyone outside of school.'' John Leddy taught Ms. Monheit from fourth grade through high school.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Leddy got so many kids started,'' Ms. Monheit said. ''What he and the others taught us was so important. They were so terrific at teaching, many of their students went on to become teachers themselves. That's how special the program was.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leddy thought it was Ms. Monheit who was special: ''Even at 9 she would talk about Ella Fitzgerald. She's the only kid I knew who could carry on a conversation like that.''</p>
        <p>He cites her ''uncanny ability to interpret lyrics and ability to find the blue note'' as her distinguishing characteristics.</p>
        <p>Soon Ms. Monheit outgrew her studies and was allowed to take control of the jazz choir. ''There wasn't that much more for me to learn,'' she said, ''so they let me teach, they let me write and they let me arrange.''</p>
        <p>For those who might think the diva-in-training is a single-minded young woman, they'd be mistaken. Ms. Monheit is spirited about a lot of things, especially Long Island.</p>
        <p>''It's the best place to live,'' she said. ''The thing I love best is the water and boating. I spend so much time in the water. It shaped my childhood. Living on the water taught me about nature. I love walking on the grass, but living by the water is just the most fun you can have. It was my inspiration.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Monheit, who attended the Manhattan School of Music, lives in  New York City, but returns home often. ''I am anchored to this place,'' she said of her Oakdale home, which is on the Great South Bay.</p>
        <p>''I have a deep water attachment,'' she said. ''It's sort of a mermaid thing. Everyone compares me to a mermaid because of my long hair, and it's weird because I always considered myself one.''</p>
        <p>With a debut that is making a big splash in the music business, Ms. Monheit has not really absorbed the extent of her success.</p>
        <p>''I didn't think this was going to happen. I was just making a little record. I thought it would get into some strange little record store and I'd sell 10 copies to friends and family,'' said the young singer who has already taped a BET special and will perform at the Village Vanguard and tour England this summer.</p>
        <p>All this because she took part in the Thelonius Monk Institute Vocal Competition. In 1998, she didn't make the initial cut, but, she recalled, ''more funding arrived and I was notified that another slot had opened.''</p>
        <p>After a bout of nerves she told herself: ''This is what I was meant to be doing. I have no reason to be afraid.'' Little did she expect that she would place second to the celebrated Teri Thornton, after singing ''Detour Ahead,'' ''I Wish You Love'' and ''Lover Come Back To Me.''</p>
        <p>At the competition she caught the attention of record labels, managers and the press.</p>
        <p>In a short career with many highlights, one stands out: the all-star band that accompanied her on her record, an airy collection of pitch-perfect standards like ''More Than You Know,'' ''Twisted'' and ''My Foolish Heart.''</p>
        <p>A who's who of jazz -- Kenny Barron, Ron Carter, Lewis Nash, Bucky Pizzarelli, Hank Crawford and David (Fathead) Newman -- provided the instrumentation. ''It was incredible luck to get to work with that band,'' Ms. Monheit said, ''a dream come true.''</p>
        <p>And the feeling was mutual. Mr. Barron, the well-respected jazz pianist said, ''Jane's beautiful phrasing and great intonation underscore a unique styling of song. She's got it!''</p>
        <p>Ms. Monheit, who has often been compared to Ella Fitzgerald (''I can't conceal her influence'') would like to pattern her career after Diana Krall, who she credits with ''making jazz American pop.''</p>
        <p>''I'm just this young girl from Long Island,'' Ms. Monheit said. ''I'm the last person that this should be happening to. I thought people would be saying, 'Hey, who's that little white girl?' But everyone's really embracing me.''</p>
        <p>Her plan is simple. She would love to get into musical theater, work for a while and ''have a bunch of kids.''</p>
        <p>In two years, she and her fiance, 23-year-old Rick Montalbano, a jazz drummer, will marry. So once again she will sing at a wedding. ''It will be a giant jazz jam,'' she said.</p>
