        <p>Walter Poenisch, a retired cookie baker and marathon swimmer who observed his 65th birthday by becoming the first man to swim from Havana to the Florida Keys -- a feat not universally recognized -- died on June 6 at his home in suburban Columbus, Ohio. He was 86.</p>
        <p>On the night of July 11, 1978, Mr. Poenisch was seen off by Fidel Castro as he plunged into the Straits of Florida. Thirty-three and a half hours and 128.8 miles later, he staggered ashore at Little Duck Key, near Marathon, Fla.</p>
        <p>Sticklers for the rules on such matters objected that Mr. Poenisch had worn swim fins, used a breathing tube and taken several breaks out of the water during a swim vouched for only by his wife and the captain and crew of his escort boat.</p>
        <p>He and his witnesses countered that he could not have made it through shark-infested waters without the equipment and that he took only permissible medical breaks to be treated for jellyfish stings and for regreasing his body.</p>
        <p>Mr. Poenisch, who had taken up long-distance swimming at 49, had already swum all the way into the Guinness Book of Records.</p>
        <p>In 1976 he swam -- certifiably -- 122 1/2 miles from Key West to the tip of the Florida peninsula, at the time  the world's longest ocean swim.</p>
        <p>In earlier years, Mr. Poenisch performed as a rodeo rider and swimmer with a loaded river ferry in tow.</p>
        <p>He was the superintendent of a bakery in Indianapolis before opening his own cake factory. He later worked as a cookie consultant and helped establish many other bakeries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Poenisch's survivors include his wife, Faye; two sons, Richard I. and Walter Jr.; and two sisters, Olga Tokar and Jeanne Simon.</p>
