        <p>With the stinging clarity of broken glass, Hilda Cuesta remembers the night the police came to tell her that her 21-year-old son, Daniel, had been killed trying to cross the Bruckner Expressway. It was Christmas Day.</p>
        <p>Daniel Cuesta had been returning home from Pelham Bay Park, which is on the eastern side of the Bruckner Expressway. Rather than walk to one of the two overpasses, he did what residents say is all too common: he darted across the highway.</p>
        <p>Less than a year later, Ms. Cuesta learned from an article in a local newspaper that a child of Catherine Bowen's, another neighborhood mother, had died in an accident at the same crossing. Ms. Cuesta called Ms. Bowen, whose 17-year-old son, Kenneth, was killed last August.</p>
        <p>Out of sorrow came action. In January, the two women began circulating petitions demanding the installation of fencing to deter such behavior. While there are short fences on either side of the highway, they can easily be climbed. The two women believe that a fence running along the median would be the only effective deterrent to a dash across the road.</p>
        <p>''People say, 'Why did your son cross the highway like that?' '' Ms. Bowen said. ''He was 17. That's what boys do. If there had been a fence there, though, he might have thought twice about it.''</p>
        <p>So far, the two women have collected more than 3,000 signatures. They have also received letters of support from many city officials.</p>
        <p>The city's Department of Transportation has erected a fence along the median between the two pedestrian bridges, but the two women want fencing that runs the length of the highway from Pelham Parkway to the Throgs Neck Expressway. However, Mark Patterson, a department spokesman, said more extensive fencing is not needed because other areas of the highway do not pose serious crossing risks and more extensive fencing could hinder the work of emergency crews.</p>
        <p>The other day, as cars roared along the Bruckner, Ms. Cuesta and Ms. Bowen stood on the pedestrian bridge at Middletown Road next to a bouquet of flowers that had been tucked into the gray metal fence. Below the flowers, children had painted the words ''R.I.P. Kenny.''</p>
        <p>''I just hope that they put up the whole fence soon,'' Ms. Bowen said. ''I'm tired. I need time to grieve.''</p>
