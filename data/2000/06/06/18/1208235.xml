        <p>Strawberries are bred for their luscious flavor, not for shipping. They are delicate, juicy and perishable unlike their more rugged West Coast counterparts.</p>
        <p>''You can throw a California berry at a brick wall and nothing happens,'' said Sandi Rose, who raises six varieties of strawberries on 10 acres in South Glastonbury. She explained that field-ripened berries have the best flavor because the natural sugars are allowed to develop to their peak.</p>
        <p>Since the 17th century, when William Butler wrote ''Doubtless God could have made a better berry but doubtless God never did,'' strawberries have been popular.</p>
        <p>In 1998, 93.7 percent of American households surveyed reported eating fresh strawberries, according to the federal Department of Agriculture. Connecticut produces a tiny percentage of that. Norman Gaulthier, an associate professor in the Department of Plant Science at the University of Connecticut, said all the strawberry fields in the state total 1,000 acres or less. And those are berries that stay in Connecticut. Even those farms large enough to sell the fruit wholesale sell it to other local farmstands.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, strawberry season is short, generally tapering off by the first week in July, said Rick Macsuga of the State Department of Agriculture.</p>
        <p>One strategy farmers use to prolong the season is planting different varieties to offer early, middle and late crops during the season.</p>
        <p>John Lyman operates a pick-your-own fruit and farm market complex on 250 acres in Middlefield. He does not believe that most consumers notice the change from one type to another. ''To the average person,'' Mr. Lyman said, ''a strawberry is a strawberry, but using different varieties tends to stretch our season.''</p>
        <p>Donald Dzen runs the largest strawberry farm in the state, in South Windsor. He offers pick-your-own as well as fruit already picked retail and wholesale. With 40 acres under cultivation he knows strawberries well and he thinks the sweetest-tasting berries are not dark red but orange. He favors the variety called All Star, which several other Connecticut growers also offer. Some of the other varieties to be found this year include Kent, Cavendish, Delmarva, Jewel and Winona.</p>
        <p>Strawberries, blueberries and raspberries combined contribute about $2.1 million directly to the state's economy, Mr. Macsuga said. (California, the largest strawberry producing state, valued their 1998 crop at $783 million.)</p>
        <p>But Connecticut strawberries fulfill another economic function.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lyman, who has cultivated the berries for 25 years, said, ''Strawberries get the season started.'' He reports that pickers often load up on strawberries in the field, then go to the store to purchase other produce.  And strawberries lure out-of-state visitors to Connecticut. Mrs. Rose said strawberry growers were ''in the business of entertainment farming.''</p>
        <p>The berries also play a significant role in the tourism industry. More and more Connecticut farms are switching to pick-your-own since they find the cost of labor prohibitive. It is grueling stoop labor where harvesters must remain on their hands and knees for the work day. Most of the workers come from Mexico and return to the same farms year after year.</p>
        <p>Very few local people are willing to do this kind of work. An exception is Terry Jones's farm. He began raising strawberries in the early 1960's when he was a high school student. Today he employs students who want to learn more about agriculture and the environment. They spend many hours on their hands and knees pulling weeds. Mr. Jones, a sixth-generation farmer, sees farms, and especially pick-your-own operations, as a ''tremendous complement to the tourism industry.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones also feels passionate about farmland preservation. He says that when customers come to the farm to buy fruit, vegetables and plants, they are ''voting with their consumer dollars to save some precious farm land.''</p>
        <p>Picking the fruit rather than buying it already picked does save money. The cost to consumers this year will be not much more than it was last year, perhaps 5 or 10 cents a pound more. Mr. Macsuga estimated the cost at $1 to $1.25 a pound to pick your own, and $3 to $4 to buy strawberries by the quart.</p>
        <p>An early heat wave followed by below-normal temperature left the strawberries a bit confused, but they have adjusted and the strawberry season had a strong start this year. What could ruin the tender crop would be heavy rain. Last year was a washout for some farmers since heavy rains came in the middle of their season. For others, the rain came at the right time or they irrigated and their crop produced at record levels.</p>
        <p>At the Glendale farm in Milford the plants suffered during the drought and they will not offer any strawberries this year.</p>
        <p>Strawberry season is very intense for the farmers. George Hindinger, who farms six acres of berries in Hamden, said: ''When they are ripe they have to be picked and not left a couple of days like blueberries. They have be picked and they have to be brought to market fast.''</p>
        <p>When the rush is over his family sells strawberry products such as fresh jam at their farm market.</p>
        <p>For those worried about sampling unwashed berries, Mr. Gaulthier offers some reassurance. Connecticut's climate, he said, is mild so pesticides are used minimally and none as harvest time approaches.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Rose warns consumers to avoid plastic wrapping and heat. ''Use paper towels,'' she advises and ''remember heat is the enemy of strawberries.'' She explained that modern frost-free refrigerators ''zap the moisture out of strawberries so they must stay covered.'' Visitors go to Rose's Berry Farm for breakfast pancakes with strawberries from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Sundays only.</p>
        <p>After the strawberry season comes to an end Mrs. Rose serves her pancakes topped with fresh blueberries.</p>
