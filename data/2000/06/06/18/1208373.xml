        <p>A contested plan to widen sidewalks along part of Eighth Street has received the support of leading Community Board 2 officials, and construction may begin as early as next spring. But some residents are threatening to bring a lawsuit to block the project.</p>
        <p>The Village Alliance Business Improvement District announced its final proposal last week to expand sidewalks by two and a half feet on either side between Avenue of the Americas and Broadway. The proposed design also calls for additional trees and new decorative lampposts and street signs. Honi Klein, the executive director of the improvement group, said the goal was to relieve congested sidewalks and beautify the area.</p>
        <p>But that point was lost at a boisterous hearing Monday, when an audience of 150 interrupted Ms. Klein and other community board members at least two dozen times.</p>
        <p>''We're being railroaded,'' yelled Arlene Koenig, president of the East Eighth/Ninth Street Block Association. She was among many residents concerned that a narrower roadway would clog traffic along Eighth Street and divert vehicles to nearby streets, producing congestion there.</p>
        <p>The Department of Transportation said it had studied the proposal and has no objections. ''The widening of the street will not have an adverse effect on traffic flow,'' said the commissioner for Manhattan, Joseph Albano.</p>
        <p>The $1.6 million project, which has been on the drawing board for nearly three years, would be financed by public and private money.</p>
