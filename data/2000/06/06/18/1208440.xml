        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Should people in their 60's -- who are in good health and whose parents lived long lives -- ''rationally choose to defer'' receiving Social Security,  as one scholar advised in the column?</p>
        <p>Some people, however, have no choice; they need the money to live on, or to help out their relatives. It can hardly be irrational to pass it up.</p>
        <p>The column also saw a ''second irrational tendency'' among people drawing both paychecks and benefit checks: to spend the pension money instead of saving it for the future. But again, as has been widely reported, many Americans are in no position to save.</p>
        <p>They really need money, and need it whenever they can get it.</p>
