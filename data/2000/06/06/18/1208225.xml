        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mr. Landesman objects to regional theaters' consideration of marketing factors in the selection of plays. Regional theater is the experimental pot from which the meal of theater art is to be created. Yet we are asked to assume that the heat for the cooking fire is to be generated by love, not money.</p>
        <p>It is certainly true that regional theater has become the creative source for new work in the American theater, in large part because the commercial theater has abdicated that responsibility in its flight from risk. Regional theater is being asked to bear the cost of artistic experimentation.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mr. Landesman objects to regional theaters' consideration of marketing factors in the selection of plays. Regional theater is the experimental pot from which the meal of theater art is to be created. Yet we are asked to assume that the heat for the cooking fire is to be generated by love, not money.</p>
        <p>It is certainly true that regional theater has become the creative source for new work in the American theater, in large part because the commercial theater has abdicated that responsibility in its flight from risk. Regional theater is being asked to bear the cost of artistic experimentation.</p>
        <p>My question is, with what? How is regional theater supposed to find the wherewithal to promote new ideas, support experimentation and perform the work of artists shunned by commercial theater? Contributions from generous donors, surely. That accounts, on the average, for approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of revenues required to break even.</p>
        <p>What about the remainder? Federal government participation is heading toward zero. That leaves ticket sales. Unless we want to do it just for love -- in which case we can have a lusty orgy and be out of business in a couple of years -- for a continuing, vital community theater we need to sell a few tickets so that we can actually pay the people who create the work (and we can pay only a paltry amount at that).</p>
