        <p>Stefan Westerhoff letter on June 4 article scores way conductor Kurt Masur is treated by New York Philharmonic (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The way Kurt Masur is treated by the New York Philharmonic's administration is truly repulsive, and James Oestreich's article [''Who Dares Call This Maestro a Lame Duck?,'' June 4] illustrates that little has changed since the days when Gustav Mahler fought his exhausting New York battles. Once again the argument that Mr. Masur has ''limitations in his repertory'' is brought up. It is a widespread misunderstanding that every conductor should cover the whole repertory. Some of today's most creative conductors have achieved outstanding quality by deliberately focusing on their field of expertise and interest: Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Charles Mackerras come to mind. Mr. Masur is careful in choosing his repertory and devoted to what he conducts, and it shows. I, for one, prefer this philosophy to the ''one size fits all'' approach that brings you listless performances like those given by recent guest conductors.</p>
