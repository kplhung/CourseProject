        <p>Just when a certain segment of Yankee fandom is speculating that the end is near, that just because the sky has never fallen that there isn't a first time -- and that that time may be now -- along comes the manager, dark eyed, dusky visaged and with an outlook that if not as bright as a light bulb is decidedly not as dim as disaster.</p>
        <p>And no big deal for Joe Torre that a pitcher in his first major league game, just called up from Columbus, was forced into the starting rotation yesterday in Yankee Stadium against the Chicago White Sox, the hottest team in baseball and the one with the best record.</p>
        <p>''Jake Westbrook is just 22,'' Torre said, ''but we saw him in spring training and he showed a lot of maturity.'' Torre added that Westbrook had the ability to throw several different pitches for a strike on the first pitch, so he generally did not get in a hole to the batter posthaste.</p>
        <p>Before the game, Torre noted that his team's record was just about where it was last season after 61 games. ''And,'' he said, ''we still haven't had a hot streak, and we're due. We're in the pennant race -- to stay.''</p>
        <p>What the Yankees have had is a streak of misfortune, mishaps and missteps. Their pitching this side of the bullpen has been inconsistent, their offense has bordered on the odious, their designated hitters have been a disappointment and two of their pitching aces have been suffering -- Roger Clemens is on the 15-day disabled list with a groin injury, and David Cone, until recently, had thought that at age 37, he might be facing a severe geriatric problem.</p>
        <p>Of course there is also the second-base perplexity, in which Chuck Knoblauch has found that putting a square peg in a round hole is child's play compared to throwing accurately to first base. His problem has brought so many opinions from psychiatrists, professional and amateur, that the inside of Knoblauch's head is becoming as open as half a melon.</p>
        <p>And yet: After 61 games last season, the Yanks were 36-25, in first place by a game and a half in the American League East. Now, they were 34-27, a half-game behind the Boston Red Sox. ''And last season,'' Torre said, ''we really didn't get going until after the All-Star break.''</p>
        <p>Even from the other side of the field, things looked less than bleak for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''The manager is perfect for that team,'' said Jerry Manuel, the White Sox manager. ''He doesn't panic, and so the team doesn't panic.''</p>
        <p>Manuel also saw little problem in starting a raw rookie at this time. The sky, he intimated, wouldn't be falling on Westbrook, either.</p>
        <p>And so? Maybe not the whole sky, but perhaps just a cloud laden with lead appeared to land with a thud on the skull of young Westbrook.</p>
        <p>The White Sox scored one run in the first inning off him, when the  6-foot-3-inch right-hander fell behind several hitters. He walked the first major league batter he faced. The White Sox scored again and again in the second inning with the biggest blow being Magglio Ordonez's three-run homer. When the next batter, Frank Thomas, singled, Torre went out to remove Westbrook, who was met with a mixture of hard-hearted boos and soft-hearted cheers from the fans, as the scoreboard read: White Sox 6, Yankees 0.</p>
        <p>Then in the fourth, another chunk of sky plunked down on Knoblauch. He came in for a ground ball as the ballpark held its collective breath. Knoblauch straightened, cocked his arm for what was supposed to be a routine short throw and whipped the ball over first baseman Tino Martinez's head. The ball sailed into the box seats, hitting a woman sitting about eight rows up, on the side of the face. She left for medical attention, but fortunately did not appear to be seriously hurt.</p>
        <p>As soon as Knoblauch released the ball, he knew it was gone, and he jerked his head down in disgust. He had said Friday that after he made three errors Thursday night, his mother in Texas had called and said she wished she were there to hug him. The guess here is that most of the fans in the stands wished, after this sad moment, to hug him, too.</p>
        <p>Something, however, has clearly held this team together in these gloomy times -- that is, for the defending world champions to remain on the heels of the division-leading Red Sox.</p>
        <p>''Experience,'' said Paul O'Neill, the right fielder. ''We've been through a lot of pressure times, and that's given us perspective. What's a one-run game in June compared to a deciding game in the World Series? We seem to be treading water until now, but we can't look back. We're accustomed to winning. We know we just have to dig in.''</p>
        <p>Experience, Torre had said, shows itself in little ways. ''In close games, when behind, we know that we have to think small,'' he said. ''That is, be patient at the plate, be wise on the bases, look to get one run at a time.''</p>
        <p>It worked, to a degree. The Yankees came back from an 8-0 deficit in the third inning, coming within one run at 10-9 and threatening in the ninth with a Ricky Ledee double before Scott Brosius grounded out to end the game, their third straight loss the White Sox.</p>
        <p>The game was interrupted for 57 minutes in the fifth inning, when what was left of the sky opened up and rain washed down on the Stadium.</p>
        <p>For the Yankees, desperately seeking positive signs, that seemed the apex of their evening's labors.</p>
