        <p>No wonder so many children get lost: parents don't lead (''Parents Try to Reclaim Their Children's Time,'' news article, June 13). Do parents like the ones featured in your article need propping up from the whole community before taking charge? I'd be ashamed to let our children run our life - more ashamed still to go hat in hand to some coach for permission to visit Grandma or to take a vacation.</p>
