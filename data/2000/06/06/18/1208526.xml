        <p>New York City police union leaders urged their members to boycott concerts by Bruce Springsteen, who has begun performing a new song about the shooting of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed immigrant from Guinea who died in a hail of police gunfire last year. Ignoring the criticism, Mr. Springsteen performed the song, ''American Skin,'' at Madison Square Garden, where he began by singing the words ''41 shots'' nine times.</p>
        <p>Four officers fired 41 shots at Mr. Diallo in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building. They said they thought he was reaching for a gun; it turned out to be a wallet. The officers were acquitted of murder charges earlier this year.</p>
