        <p>THE GRAVITY OF SUNLIGHT</p>
        <p>By Rosa Shand.</p>
        <p>239 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Soho Press. $24.</p>
        <p>In 1962, Uganda, a fertile country in equatorial Africa made up of several ancient kingdoms, ceased to be a British protectorate. Independence came with high hopes, but almost from the start Milton Obote, the first prime minister, found himself governing a far from united nation. In 1971, Gen. Idi Amin seized power, establishing a decade-long reign of terror.</p>
        <p>These tumultuous events constitute not so much the background as the weather, the climate, of Rosa Shand's remarkable first novel, ''The Gravity of Sunlight,'' whose plot follows the precarious marriage of Agnes and John, Americans teaching in the city of Kampala during the months when Obote's power was waning. At that time, Uganda was barely on the map for many Americans, and Shand is cannily aware of this. She presumes a certain level of ignorance on the part of her readers and in a brief prologue gives us a vivid sketch of a country that was once known as the Pearl of Africa. Neither here nor elsewhere, however, does she burden us with lengthy exposition. Indeed, part of the pleasure -- and the power -- of this novel comes from the elliptical fashion in which so much information is conveyed. We see Uganda and learn about its customs in a sidelong, glancing way. Except for Agnes, the characters are treated in the same fashion. Shand reveals them in fits and snatches, a technique that could be alienating but only makes them seem more real.</p>
        <p>Shand is similarly deft in her handling of time. ''The Gravity of Sunlight'' is written with acute, sensuous detail, as if the events described had occurred not 30 years ago but just last week, just yesterday. ''The rain stopped. The clouds, late morning, broke into chunks, so it was mostly sunny, and it was Saturday.'' These vivid scenes are presented in 41 short chapters with titles like ''On Disseminating Whiteness and John Bunyan'' and ''On the Usefulness of Anthills.'' However luxurious the evocation of time and place, we are not simply in the grip of nostalgia. A highly intelligent narrator is clearly at work.</p>
        <p>Each chapter also begins with a prefatory paragraph or two, often written in the second person present tense, that at times seems to address Agnes and at others a more general audience. These prefaces function in various ways. Some set the scene: a description of a great blue ibis in the middle of a Kampala street. Some teach us about local customs: the ritualized exchange of greetings in Buganda. Some meditate on more general questions like the relationhip between novels and ''real'' life. (''Novels are deceptive. No wonder they were forbidden reading for so long, in so many places. They're all about attachments.'') The overall effect of this structure -- the specificity of individual scenes in which characters and country hurtle toward their destiny, interspersed with reflective pauses -- is to give the narrative both the immediacy and the distance of a dream. ''It's not clear why, if you live in Africa and leave the place, you never drop the subject,'' we are told early on. ''It could be nostalgia for adventure, or for sun and canna lilies all year round. But it's probable you felt more human -- more connected -- when you lived in Africa, even when you never quite came out with that in words.''</p>
        <p>''The Gravity of Sunlight'' is as much about a love affair with a country as with an individual. Fittingly, we learn only the bare minimum about Agnes and John's American past. The couple, nave and bookish, met in college and married, at least in part, to escape their parents. Their idealism, plus a horror of suburbia, brought them to Uganda. After a stint in the countryside, they moved to Kampala, where John teaches at Lubega College and Agnes teaches part-time at a lower school. They live on the grounds of the college.</p>
        <p>The novel opens with Agnes musing on love at the Nile Cafe. After more than a decade of marriage and the birth of three children, she is aware of ''some huge gap between herself and John over little matters like this -- like can a person will to love.'' John, whom Agnes believes to be both upright and oblivious, is convinced that you can. Agnes just as firmly holds the opposite view. In fact, this gap has existed for some time, perhaps, she fears, since before they were married. Not surprisingly, over the years Agnes has conceived several passionate but unconsummated attachments -- most recently for a neighbor named Megan, whose husband also teaches at the college, and for Odinga, her former houseboy.</p>
        <p>Recently, though, at the college mailboxes, Agnes has caught sight of a tall, thin man with a bony face and blondish hair, and he has caught sight of her. Glimpsing his newspaper, printed in an odd foreign language, she christens him the Finn and begins to collect her mail more often.</p>
        <p>But haven't we heard this song before? Isn't adultery a mainstay of the bourgeois novel? Yes indeed, and in Shand's skillful hands that very familiarity only adds to the suspense. In spite of guilt and misgivings, Agnes and Wulf (he turns out to be not a Finn but a Pole) embark on an affair. Of course, he is a better lover than her husband. Of course, he is more politically sensitive. But this affair is both governed by the threat of political upheaval -- soldiers are appearing in the city with increasing frequency -- and modified by the affections and actions of two other characters, local people who orbit the central trio like dark moons.</p>
        <p>One of these is Odinga and the other is Prudence, a beautiful, intelligent Tutsi girl who has decided to become the first woman archdeacon of her church. As a preliminary, Prudence gets her aunts to persuade Agnes to tutor her so that she will be able to attend Lubega College. These sessions, during which Prudence reads aloud from ''Paradise Lost,'' provide some of the novel's most humorous moments. But nothing is simple in ''The Gravity of Sunlight.'' Agnes discovers that Prudence has a talent for painting and, in spite of her reservations about the girl, feels duty bound to encourage that talent. What Agnes doesn't discover is exactly what Prudence has in mind when she talks about needing a ''spiritual adviser.'' And then there is Odinga, the ex-houseboy who insists on being given back his job. His motivations for intervening in Agnes's affairs remain somewhat mysterious, and rightly so.</p>
        <p>Of course, we already know one part of how the novel ends: with the terrible fate that befell Uganda under Idi Amin. But even so, Rosa Shand is much too good a writer not to keep on surprising us until the very last page.</p>
        <p>Margot Livesey's most recent book is a novel, ''The Missing World.''</p>
