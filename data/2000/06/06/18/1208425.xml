        <p>After 35 years at the corner of Eighth Avenue and 15th Street, a small shop, Flanzer Jewelers, is closing on or about Friday, depending on how long it takes for the store's supply of merchandise to run out.</p>
        <p>The store, the oldest in its building, a former Port Authority freight handling building, at 111 Eighth Avenue, that fills an entire block and is being renovated to make it more attractive to Internet companies, was forced to close because of escalating rents, said the store's co-owner.</p>

        <p>The store, the oldest in its building, a former Port Authority freight handling building, at 111 Eighth Avenue, that fills an entire block and is being renovated to make it more attractive to Internet companies, was forced to close because of escalating rents, said the store's co-owner.</p>
        <p>The shop, which has a repair area behind the counter, is offering 50 percent off all merchandise, which last week included silver Speidel bracelets, 14 karat gold cuff links on the store's own label and sterling silver Sunstone earrings.</p>
