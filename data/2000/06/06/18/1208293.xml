        <p>Re ''A Nation of Liberty, Justice and Free Beaches for All'' (June 4):</p>
        <p>Brenden P. Leydon's utopia of free Connecticut beaches is a misguided effort destined to destroy the enjoyment of all Connecticut beachgoers.</p>
        <p>Most beaches are limited by access, the roads and the parking are inadequate for in-town residents.  There is quite simply no way to make everyone happy.</p>
        <p>The state attempted to satisfy citizens by opening public parks, but to people like Mr. Leydon, that is not enough. I am reminded of a child at a birthday party whining for more presents and unsatisfied with what he got. Mr. Leydon and those in support of his free beaches should devote their efforts to more worthy causes. We might all be entitled to access of public lands, but we should also be able to send our children to adequately equipped schools, go to bed with a full stomach, have a bed to sleep in at night. The list is endless.</p>
