        <p>FORTY years ago, Billy Wilder's ''Apartment'' and Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho'' opened in New York the same week -- the kind of double whammy that reminds us we now live in impoverished times. The films have nothing in common except that each has a lonely bachelor with a unique approach to ensuring a female guest stays over a little longer -- and each has terrific bathroom scenes. In ''Psycho,'' Norman Bates goes to one of his motel rooms dressed as his mom and stabs the heroine to death in the shower. In ''The Apartment,'' the lowly insurance clerk C. C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) removes the blade from his safety razor lest the suicidal elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) should try to slash her wrists; he later scrapes his lathered jaw with the bladeless razor -- we can see the gag coming and are glad when it arrives.</p>
        <p>Each, too, is an American classic, although ''The Apartment'' has barely been acknowledged as such. It did make No. 93 in the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 films (''Psycho'' ranked 18th), but of the 250 critics and filmmakers polled in 1992 by the British magazine Sight and Sound, only the directors Pedro Almodovar and Terry Gilliam and the critic Paolo D'Agostini included it in their top 10 films. Even the critic Mark Cousins, who wrote the introduction to Mr. Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond's recently published ''Apartment'' screenplay, would only admit that ''The Apartment'' is ''the best non-masterpiece of American cinema.''</p>

        <p>FORTY years ago, Billy Wilder's ''Apartment'' and Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho'' opened in New York the same week -- the kind of double whammy that reminds us we now live in impoverished times. The films have nothing in common except that each has a lonely bachelor with a unique approach to ensuring a female guest stays over a little longer -- and each has terrific bathroom scenes. In ''Psycho,'' Norman Bates goes to one of his motel rooms dressed as his mom and stabs the heroine to death in the shower. In ''The Apartment,'' the lowly insurance clerk C. C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) removes the blade from his safety razor lest the suicidal elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) should try to slash her wrists; he later scrapes his lathered jaw with the bladeless razor -- we can see the gag coming and are glad when it arrives.</p>
        <p>Each, too, is an American classic, although ''The Apartment'' has barely been acknowledged as such. It did make No. 93 in the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 films (''Psycho'' ranked 18th), but of the 250 critics and filmmakers polled in 1992 by the British magazine Sight and Sound, only the directors Pedro Almodovar and Terry Gilliam and the critic Paolo D'Agostini included it in their top 10 films. Even the critic Mark Cousins, who wrote the introduction to Mr. Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond's recently published ''Apartment'' screenplay, would only admit that ''The Apartment'' is ''the best non-masterpiece of American cinema.''</p>
        <p>However, having doubled its $3 million cost at the box office, in April 1961 ''The Apartment'' scooped up six Oscars, including the best film award. (Nominees Lemmon, MacLaine and Jack Kruschen, who played the kindly Dr. Dreyfuss, Baxter's long-suffering neighbor, were overlooked.) So often criticized for its choices, the Academy had unmistakably recognized the greatness of ''The Apartment.''</p>
        <p>Why has ''The Apartment'' never entered the pantheon along with similarly acidic Wilder masterpieces like ''Sunset Boulevard'' (1950) and ''Some Like It Hot'' (1959)? To me it is a much more humanistic and relevant film -- funnier, too. One explanation for its secondary status is that its tawdry premise is unacceptably realistic: Baxter climbs to the fabled 27th floor of his corporation by lending his apartment to influential married colleagues who need somewhere to bed their mistresses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilder had been inspired by the man who lends his apartment to the adulterous lovers in David Lean's comparatively coy ''Brief Encounter'' (1945). ''I think that the interesting character is the friend who returns to his home and finds the bed still warm, he who has no mistress,'' Mr. Wilder once said. The moral dilemma Baxter faces is what to do when he discovers that his boss, Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray), is soiling his sheets with the elevator girl, Miss Kubelik, whom he, Baxter, loves. Baxter eventually takes a stand, telling Sheldrake, ''The old payola won't work anymore'' -- a reference to the payola scandals of 1960.</p>
        <p>''The Apartment'' split the critics. The New York Times's Bosley Crowther described it as ''a gleeful, tender, and even sentimental film.'' Time magazine raved over it. But The Saturday Review's Hollis Alpert famously described it as ''a dirty fairy tale,'' and Ann Marsters of The Chicago American allegedly told Wilder in person that he had made a dirty film. It never recovered from those slurs, which, in that season of bluenoses, mirrored the attacks on ''Peeping Tom'' that destroyed the director Michael Powell's career. Unlike ''The Apartment,'' Powell's terrifying study of voyeurism is now considered visionary.</p>
        <p>Asked about ''The Apartment'' recently, Mr. Lemmon said it is about ''the misuse of the American Dream.''</p>
        <p>''It's not that Baxter was a nice guy who's gone wrong, it's that he's hysterically naive,'' he said. ''He'd been taught that success was how far you could get in a company and how much money you could earn, and he's surrounded by these leeches who just use him to have assignations in his apartment. We know damned well that people in big business still behave like that.''</p>
        <p>Ms. MacLaine said by phone from Malibu: ''There was always a socio-political undertone in Billy's work, and 'The Apartment' was his take on corporate tyranny. I remember the first preview we did: people weren't sure whether the picture was a comedy or a drama, but they recognized their own lives in it and how you're subjected to either selling your soul or trying to hold onto it as you climb the corporate ladder.''</p>
        <p>''The Apartment'' revels in sadomasochistic humiliation. Baxter sits on a Central Park bench on a freezing November night while one of his ''superiors'' romps in his bed with a Marilyn Monroe lookalike. Miss Kubelik can't get it into her head that Mr. Sheldrake just wants her for sex. Miss Olsen (Edie Adams), Mr. Sheldrake's secretary and discarded mistress, has sat outside his office for four years watching the ''new models pass by.''  ''Humiliation always happens in a tyranny,'' Ms. MacLaine wryly observed. ''And that foments revolution.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Adams gave one of the superb supporting performances. The others include Mr. Kruschen; Naomi Stevens as Dr. Dreyfuss's wife, who kvetches about Baxter's non-existent womanizing; Hope Holiday as the barfly Baxter takes home on Christmas Eve, only to find the comatose Miss Kubelik there; and David White as the lecherous Mr. Kirkeby, whose habit of using the suffix ''-wise'' -- ''So you hit the jackpot, eh kid? I mean, Kubelik-wise?'' -- is caught by the impressionable Baxter as easily as the cold he catches in Central Park.</p>
        <p>B ILLY told me Miss Olsen was flat-out bitter,'' Ms. Adams recalled. ''But if you play that it becomes a flat performance, so I didn't. I did what Lee Strasberg taught me to do -- act naturally.'' Ms. Adams brought rancor born of pain to Miss Olsen, who finally blows the whistle on Mr. Sheldrake.</p>
        <p>Although Neil LaBute's savage ''In the Company of Men'' updated the office and sexual politics of Mr. Wilder's film to the mid-90's, ''The Apartment'' is a jarring time capsule of sexist shenanigans. In one scene, Mr. Kirkeby gropes Miss Kubelik as he leaves her elevator; in another the camera tracks loftily across the office Christmas party where numerous couples are necking. Mr. Sheldrake fires Miss Olsen without fear of reprisal. Yet ultimately, ''The Apartment'' champions Dr. Dreyfuss's heartfelt appeal to Baxter to ''be a mensch.''</p>
        <p>And, as Mr. Lemmon claims, ''the love story was genuine. I remember saying at the time that Billy had grown a rose in a garbage pail.'' Look again at the lovelorn Baxter gently tucking in Miss Kubelik as she dozes after their card game, and his delight in straining spaghetti through a tennis racket during her unexpected Christmas layover, and you'll see what he means -- love both story-wise and comedy-wise.</p>
