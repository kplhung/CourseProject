        <p>The remarkable summit meeting between the Korean leaders this week has left the Clinton administration widely divided over North Korea's intentions, but has not so far diminished its resolve to move ahead with a missile defense, administration and defense officials say.</p>
        <p>Despite recent diplomatic forays that culminated in a general agreement between the Korean leaders to work for peace and unity on their divided peninsula, North Korea has not stopped work on the long-range missile program that has helped provoke proposals for the United States to build a defensive shield, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, a highly classified intelligence report being prepared for President Clinton will conclude that, if the current pace of development remains unchanged, North Korea could still build a missile capable of striking the United States by 2005, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Without more concrete agreements and changes in North Korea's behavior, the officials said, it would not be prudent to back away from plans to build the missile defense now, despite the fact that the proposal has roiled relations with Russia, China and even America's European allies.</p>
        <p>Three days of smiles and toasts, they emphasized, do not erase years of effort by North Korea to build nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them.</p>
        <p>''Not from the summit and not from any of the other things have we seen any signs that they are changing their program to develop missiles,'' Walter B. Slocombe, the under secretary of defense for policy, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the officials acknowledge that they will face even greater diplomatic pressure after this week's summit meeting to forswear the shield.</p>
        <p>And they say that the striking scenes of the Korean leaders warmly embracing, holding hands and clinking Champagne glasses have underscored divisions within the administration over how -- and how quickly -- to proceed with a defensive shield and what the North's true intentions might be.</p>
        <p>Moreover, officials acknowledge that the summit meeting has helped fuel some doubts over much of the rationale for a missile defense, which is that the North Korean government was so irrational and unpredictable that it would not respond to normal threats of deterrence.</p>
        <p>''Can we argue that we face the same threat if we have a North Korea trying to integrate into the international community?'' a former senior defense official said, referring obliquely to the administration's characterization of North Korea as a rogue state. Noting that North Korea's diplomatic steps have seemed well calculated in recent months, the official added: ''How can we at the same time argue that it is an irrational state?''</p>
        <p>The North's diplomatic opening has already prompted the White House to indicate that it will lift a broad set of economic sanctions that have been in place since North Korea invaded the South 50 years ago this month.</p>
        <p>President Clinton spoke with the South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung, by telephone on Thursday and met on Friday in New York with South Korea's national security adviser, Wong Won Tak, to discuss the summit meeting. And Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright announced that she would go to South Korea next week for further discussions.</p>
        <p>But officials repeatedly emphasized that it is too soon to evaluate  promises of cooperation from North Korea and that they were looking for more concrete steps.</p>
        <p>''We need to see something more than handshakes and speeches,'' a four-star military officer said. For starters, he suggested that the North could withdraw some of its formidable artillery dug in near the border within easy range of Seoul, the South's capital.</p>
        <p>The summit meeting this week has left various parts of the administration with widely divergent interpretations as to its significance.</p>
        <p>The most wary assessment, held by some senior military officials, is that it remains impossible to decipher the true motives of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, who before this week had been described by American officials as reclusive and paranoid. They darkly suggest that he is in league with China and Russia to undercut support for an American missile shield.</p>
        <p>Some Pentagon and State Department officials, on the other hand, are cautiously optimistic that the North is indeed beginning to change.</p>
        <p>Finally, some senior intelligence officials say they believe that reconciliation between the North and South, driven by the determination of the 75-year-old South Korean president, will happen faster than anyone can predict.</p>
        <p>Officials acknowledged that the summit meeting together with North Korea's other recent diplomatic overtures might yet force a reconsideration of American assumptions about North Korea's intentions, but they said their assessment of the North missile abilities has remained unchanged. The most recent intelligence finding that is to be presented to Mr. Clinton reaches the same conclusion as last year's.</p>
        <p>Although North Korea reached an agreement with the United States last fall to suspend testing of missiles like the one fired over Japan in 1998, the North Korean military has not suspended development of a new generation of missiles, known as the Taepodong 2, the officials said.</p>
        <p>North Korea has honored its pledge not to test-fire its missiles and even renewed that pledge early this year, but intelligence analysts say they still detect work at that site, as well as other types of testing.</p>
        <p>''They continue to test motors, missile engines and things like that,'' said a senior military officer who closely monitors North Korea. ''There's nothing on their launch pads, but they're continuing to make improvements'' at the test site.</p>
        <p>Since this week's summit meeting, officials in Washington have tried to tamp down expectations that one of the last fronts of the cold war may soon disappear, fundamentally altering American security interests in Asia, including the presence of some 37,000 American troops in South Korea and its assessment of North Korea's missile threat. The day after the summit meeting, the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, called for ''warier, controlled exuberance.''</p>
        <p>Officials at the Pentagon, in particular, were adamant that whatever diplomatic progress was made, the United States was still justified in moving ahead with a limited national missile defense, the first phase of which is explicitly intended to counter a threat from North Korea.</p>
        <p>The latest assessment of North Korea's missile threat is critical to the Pentagon's plans to develop a limited defense, beginning with 100 interceptor missiles based in Alaska.</p>
        <p>The current timetable for building the $60-billion system is based entirely on last year's estimate that North Korea could have the ability to hit the United States with nuclear- or chemical-tipped ballistic missiles by 2005.</p>
        <p>In order to have a system in place by then, the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization needs to begin construction of its first sophisticated radar site in Alaska by next spring, and a decision must be made by President Clinton before then.</p>
        <p>The new intelligence report on potential missile threats -- known as a National Intelligence Estimate -- was ordered by the White House to update last year's assessment as Mr. Clinton nears a decision.</p>
        <p>Last year's intelligence report concluded that North Korea's long-range missile program had advanced much further than previously believed.</p>
        <p>In August 1998, North Korea tested a three-stage missile, known as a Taepodong 1, by firing it over Japan. The third stage of that missile, which carried a small satellite, failed to reach orbit, but intelligence officials concluded that other aspects of the test had succeeded.</p>
        <p>Last year's report concluded that the Taepodong 1 was not sophisticated enough to carry a nuclear warhead and that North Korea was more likely to put weapons on a more advanced missile, the Taepodong 2.</p>
        <p>Officials said the new intelligence report had concluded that North Korea would still be able to field an intercontinental ballistic missile by 2005. ''Certainly there is no evidence they have stopped their development program for the Taepodong 2,'' a senior defense official said.</p>
        <p>The North Korean threat is not the only factor Mr. Clinton must consider before moving ahead, but the intelligence findings will support arguments made by supporters of a missile defense that the United States needs a defensive shield. Opponents are sure to seize on the diplomatic developments to argue for postponing a decision on deploying a shield.</p>
        <p>Indeed, even before the summit meeting, the administration was struck by North Korea's relative opening after years of wary seclusion. In recent months, Mr. Kim has begun a flurry of diplomatic initiatives, including establishing relations with Italy, Brunei and Australia and applying for membership in forums of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean.</p>
        <p>The North Koreans have also revived their on-again, off-again discussions with the United States. At the end of May, North Korean negotiators surprised their American counterparts during a meeting in Rome by asking to discuss their missile program, and a new round of talks is expected soon. Last week the North Korean Army agreed to resume cooperating with searches for the remains of American soldiers killed in the Korean War, and the first team is scheduled to arrive later this month.</p>
        <p>''It is clear by looking at North Korea's behavior that something has changed in the last year, year and a half,'' the assistant secretary of state for Asian affairs, Stanley O. Roth, told defense writers before the summit meeting. ''The hermit kingdom has become the hyperactive kingdom.''</p>
        <p>On Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans applauded this week's summit meeting as a welcome first step in defusing one of the world's most dangerous hot spots, but warned against dropping America's guard against North Korea.</p>
        <p>Senator Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican on the Intelligence Committee, spoke for many of his colleagues: ''I would hope no serious person would assume we could change our policy on a dime just because of what happened in the last couple of days.''</p>
