        <p>Inserting more tumult into a long-troubled school district, the Yonkers school board fired the schools superintendent Friday night after he battled the mayor's attempts to get the city out from under a court order to desegregate its schools.</p>
        <p>The sudden firing stunned city politicians and residents, despite weeks of escalating friction between the superintendent, Andre J. Hornsby, and Mayor John Spencer. The board voted to fire Dr. Hornsby, the city's first black superintendent, after he announced improved test scores and the narrowing of a stubborn gap in achievement between black and white students -- precisely the challenge he was hired to address in 1998.</p>
        <p>''This is a tragedy, in a single word,'' said Ellis Cousens, one of three people on the eight-member board who voted not to fire Dr. Hornsby. ''The superintendent has done an outstanding job, scores have gone up dramatically across the board, and 26,000 children were benefiting.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Hornsby had been pressing the mayor to provide more money to cover a deficit the superintendent estimated at $34 million. But the debates over money were inextricably tied to accusations of racism in a district that has long been a battleground over school desegregation.</p>
        <p>Last summer, a federal court ruled that the Yonkers City School District, the state's fourth largest, was free of any ''vestiges of racism.'' That effectively reversed an order put into effect in 1986, after the court found that the city had intentionally segregated minority children in the city's poorest schools.</p>
        <p>The mayor and the school board have pronounced their eagerness to be free of the stigma of the court order. But ending the order meant that the state withheld $47 million that would have gone to programs to improve minority achievement. So the superintendent encouraged the board to appeal the decision, and argued that there were vestiges of racism in the schools.</p>
        <p>Supporters applauded Dr. Hornsby as a champion of minority children -- who now make up about 75 percent of the district's enrollment, compared with 35 percent when the court ordered it to desegregate in 1988 -- and worried yesterday that his firing would allow the city to walk away from its commitment to raising minority achievement.</p>
        <p>''This has demonstrated that Yonkers, with this political situation and this board, is too irresponsible to manage its own affairs,'' Mr. Cousens said. ''Maybe it isn't such a bad idea that the court remain involved. I hate to say that, but this clearly demonstrates that this is a city that's not ready to manage its own affairs.''</p>
        <p>But other board members insisted that they were not abandoning the goals of desegregation.</p>
        <p>''Our schools are desegregated,'' said one member, Thomas M. Weibrecht. ''Eventually, every court order must come to an end, and when your schools are desegregated and you're providing a quality education for every child, it is time for the federal courts to leave.''</p>
        <p>The fight between the mayor and Dr. Hornsby had inflamed suspicions between blacks and whites in the city. School board members vowed to find out who had leaked a confidential report by the board's lawyers that outlined evidence of lingering racism in the schools. After the firing, police arrested five protesters, including the minister of a local Baptist church who carried a Confederate flag, describing it as a symbol of what he called the mayor's racism.</p>
        <p>The board appointed a former principal and city official, Joseph Farmer, who is also black, as interim superintendent.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hornsby, a former college football player who spoke in the hard-charging metaphors of the game -- he once said he came at people ''head on'' -- increasingly irritated parents and teachers with what they called his autocratic style, and angered the mayor with his public declarations in support of continuing the desegregation order.</p>
        <p>''He alienated forces he should have been working with,'' Mr. Weibrecht said. ''We're going to move forward, collaboratively and cooperatively, with the teachers' union and the mayor, and all the people that should have been working on this to begin with.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Hornsby left the meeting Friday without comment, and could not be reached yesterday.</p>
        <p>''He had a passion for academic excellence that came from his competitive spirit,'' said Joseph M. Pastore, a professor at Pace University and the court-appointed monitor in the city's desegregation case. ''The guy is used to competing in so many ways, he was challenged by the opportunity to help children to ratchet up their performance, and I think he would have done that.''</p>
