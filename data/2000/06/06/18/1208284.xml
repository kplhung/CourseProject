        <p>The notion of a citizen's arrest is  something of a joke these days -- ridiculed, when mentioned at all. But the very real threat of a parking summons issued by someone like the man next door is rattling motorists here is like something out of Kafka.</p>

        <p>The notion of a citizen's arrest is  something of a joke these days -- ridiculed, when mentioned at all. But the very real threat of a parking summons issued by someone like the man next door is rattling motorists here is like something out of Kafka.</p>
        <p>The summons arrives in the mail a week or so after the alleged infraction, identifying the curbside vigilante -- not a police or parking enforcement officer -- as the complainant, but issued by the municipal court and packing the same bureaucratic punch and potential entanglement as a meter maid's handiwork.</p>
        <p>Then there is the outrage among ticket recipients -- mainly parents dropping off or picking up their children at school -- for having been busted by a stranger with no more vested authority than Deputy Dawg.</p>
        <p>Why, some wonder, has someone taken it upon himself to make others' lives that much more difficult.</p>
        <p>''He's got way too much time on his hands,'' said Dr. Donald Putman, who recently found a summons in his mailbox claiming that his Volvo had been illegally parked on Garden Street, by the Watchung Elementary School, on May 19 at 8:45 a.m.</p>
        <p>Dr. Putman, a pediatric cardiologist with a son in first grade, did not admit he was illegally parked that Friday. But it is the one morning each week he drives his son to school and walks him inside, he says, and there is no practical way to avoid parking illegally for several minutes.</p>
        <p>''My dad has been a cop 35 years and he's never heard of such a thing,'' said Dr. Putman, whose father is a New York State Trooper.</p>
        <p>The citizen parking enforcer is Fred Chichester, a 62-year-old math teacher in the East Orange school district. He is also a member of the Montclair Parking Committee appointed by the Township Council, which invests him with no special enforcement authority.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Chichester said his position bolstered the legitimacy of his complaints, which he said have numbered close to 20 over the past three years or so. He said most recipients simply paid the fine, typically $16 for parking in a prohibited area, although a handful have challenged them in municipal court, only to be found guilty.</p>
        <p>''Everything that I'm doing is perfectly legal, and I have been very careful,'' Mr. Chichester said.</p>
        <p>He said his motivation was ensuring the safety of schoolchildren. ''If people park their car illegally, and children cannot be seen until they are out in the street, then the children are in grave danger,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Montclair's police chief, Thomas J. Russo, acknowledged that Mr. Chichester was within his rights but he disagreed with his approach. ''In my opinion, what Mr. Chichester is doing is dangerous,'' Chief Russo said. ''He may face retribution by angry or confused citizens.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, Dennis Bliss, an official of the state's Municipal Court Services Division, said anyone who filed a parking complaint was vulnerable to a lawsuit for malicious prosecution from any defendant found not guilty.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for the State Judiciary, the Attorney General's office and the Division of Motor Vehicles said they had never heard of citizen-based parking summonses, and none could point to any provisions in state law or regulations that specifically allowed or prohibited them.</p>
        <p>''There is such a thing as a uniform traffic ticket, but it doesn't say who is supposed to write it,'' said Dana Sullivan, a spokesman for the Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
        <p>Officials in Connecticut and New York State were unaware of any citizen's parking complaints or any laws specifically addressing it. And a spokesman for the New York City Police Department, Sgt. Robert Samuel, said simply, ''We don't issue tickets based on citizen complaints.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chichester appeared outside the Nishuane School here last week.</p>
        <p>So did Wendy Donnelly, who had left her Ford Explorer illegally parked outside the school to fetch her son from chess club.</p>
        <p>''I never heard of this before,'' said Ms. Donnelly. ''I think that it could have the potential of having other citizens taking on their causes, and it could get out of hand.''</p>
        <p>Deborah Jacobs, legal director of the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, who happens to live and park in Montclair, said, ''Obviously, a citizen could have a grudge against someone and take advantage of that, although police officers hold grudges, too.''</p>
        <p>Ms Jacobs added that she was unaware of any case law regarding the legality of citizen complaints.</p>
        <p>Amy Putnam, Dr. Putnam's wife, was shaken by their summons. ''Any stranger can take the license plate of your car and make a complaint,'' she said, ''and that stranger walks away knowing who you are and where you live.''</p>
