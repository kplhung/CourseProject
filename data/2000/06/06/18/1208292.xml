        <p>An open letter to my fellow commuters:</p>
        <p>The commuting life can be a challenging one, requiring many talents: catching a nap while trying to maintain neck control, balancing hot coffee, a laptop and an egg sandwich in a two-foot-wide area, and wading through the briefcases and handbags for open seats.</p>

        <p>An open letter to my fellow commuters:</p>
        <p>The commuting life can be a challenging one, requiring many talents: catching a nap while trying to maintain neck control, balancing hot coffee, a laptop and an egg sandwich in a two-foot-wide area, and wading through the briefcases and handbags for open seats.</p>
        <p>Commuting is also a closely knit life, shoulder to shoulder, knee to knee with other riders. Mostly, you ride in harmony, hardly noticing the person next to or across from you. Every now and then there is the annoying cell phone user, or people who think they own the seat next to them as well as their own, but usually it is quiet and peaceful.</p>
        <p>This courtesy, however, doesn't seem to extend to the waste cans and recycling receptacles.</p>
        <p>Why is it that people can carry their coffee, bagel and newspapers on the train, but can't manage to deposit them in the trash cans when they depart? They opt, instead, to leave trash to clutter the seats and ensure that my briefcase or shoes will be covered in the coffee dregs that have trickled down the aisle.</p>
        <p>I have seen men in their custom-tailored shirts and Burberry raincoats leave behind a mess of office memos, newspapers and empty beer cans in paper bags under their seat. I have seen professional-looking women in heels and lipstick, not a hair out of place, shove bags, empty mail envelopes and gum wrappers at their Ferragamos.</p>
        <p>I can't fathom that they would allow this to occur in their houses, their kids leaving half-eaten apples, empty soda cans and old schoolwork under the dining room table.</p>
        <p>What happens to adults on the train that they think they can act like slobs?</p>
        <p>At last count, there were approximately eight trash and paper receptacles on each platform in Grand Central Terminal and four at each Westchester stop. They are not difficult to find and, if I did more research, I would probably find the physical action of depositing trash in those said cans would use up approximately three muscles, while my frown looking at all of the garbage on the floor uses up about 45.</p>
        <p>Granted, I wish Metro-North would install garbage cans in each car, but until they do, is it really so much to ask to pick up after yourself? Your mother would be so proud of you.</p>
