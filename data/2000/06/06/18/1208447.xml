        <p>Gilbert Schechtman letter disputes Jonathan Kozol's June 4 essay on why urban school systems fail to educate children (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The argument in Jonathan Kozol's essay rests on the assumption that  the obvious failure of urban school systems as measured by reading and writing scores and graduation rates is remediable by administrative restructuring, selective restaffing and more money. He supports his argument with his reference to an after-school tutoring program at St. Ann's Church in the South Bronx, where the children are a select and atypical group. Their parents care. And Mr. Kozol rejects the arguments of sociologists who target a deficiency in social values as the cause of failure in the schools.</p>
        <p>Most educators with years of experience in public education would disagree. Values and motivation are at the core of educational achievement. Kids do well in school when their internal value system encourages achievement, when their parents demand it and when their peers reinforce it. Those forces are operative in middle-class children, but not in underclass children, who are the clientele of the failing urban schools.</p>

        <p>Education is very different from health care and other professional-client relationships. The most important event is not what the teacher does in the classroom. It is what the student does outside the classroom. To expect that the thousands of classroom teachers can lead and motivate to the extent that they overcome the social forces outside the schools is naive.</p>
