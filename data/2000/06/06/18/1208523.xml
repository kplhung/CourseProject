        <p>Golfer Ernie Els, in second place and ten strokes behind Tiger Woods after three rounds in United States Open, claims wind can be big factor at Pebble Beach; photo (M)</p>

        <p>As the wind hurried across Pebble Beach today, sea gulls were riding it, floating on it, enjoying it as only seagulls can. But in the 100th United States Open, none of those seagulls rode the wind as smoothly as Ernie Els did.</p>

        <p>As the wind hurried across Pebble Beach today, sea gulls were riding it, floating on it, enjoying it as only seagulls can. But in the 100th United States Open, none of those seagulls rode the wind as smoothly as Ernie Els did.</p>
        <p>''That was probably the best 68 I've ever shot,'' the two-time Open champion from South Africa said of his three-under-par score.</p>
        <p>In today's third round, Els was the only golfer to break 70 as he moved to two over par for the tournament after 54 holes, 10 strokes behind Tiger Woods going into Sunday's final round. But when Els was asked if he thought he could catch Woods, he shrugged.</p>
        <p>''It depends on what Tiger does,'' Els said. ''If it's calm, he'll run away with it. We need a breeze out there to catch him. If the wind blows again, there are big numbers out there if you're not careful.</p>
        <p>''I've just got to shoot another round like this and see what happens.''</p>
        <p>Asked if Woods's big lead was similar to his 12-stroke victory at the 1997 Masters, Els disagreed.</p>
        <p>''No, not this week,'' he said. ''Not at Pebble Beach in the U.S. Open if the wind is blowing.''</p>
        <p>In completing his second round this morning, Woods hooked his tee shot on the 18th hole onto the rocks of Carmel Bay. And on the third hole of his third round, Woods had a triple-bogey 7.</p>
        <p>''But he's always making a lot of birdies,'' Els said. ''To have the mistakes he's made, you have to make birdies. And that means he's hitting it very well and putting it very well.''</p>
        <p>Els agreed that Woods's dominance was good for golf.</p>
        <p>''Tiger is probably the most recognizable sportsman on the planet right now,'' he said. ''It seems like golf has really taken off with him coming through, but it would be even better for golf if someone could step up and play with him. It's very difficult to do. He's a great player.''</p>
        <p>In this year's opening event on the PGA Tour, the Mercedes Championships in Hawaii, Els lost a two-hole playoff to Woods.</p>
        <p>''I've had my run-ins with Tiger in the past, but I haven't had enough of those run-ins with him,'' Els said. ''I'd like to get more of those battles with Tiger. I think it's definitely good for my game.</p>
        <p>''And hopefully tomorrow I'll have half a chance if he doesn't run away.''</p>
        <p>Els, who won the Open in 1994 at Oakmont and in 1997 at Congressional, had an eagle on the 331-yard fourth hole.</p>
        <p>''I had 97 yards to the hole and hit a 60-degree sand wedge,'' he said. ''I didn't see it go in, but it was a kick-start for me.''</p>
        <p>After a birdie at the 524-yard sixth hole, Els had consecutive bogeys at the 106-yard seventh and the 416-yard eighth.</p>
        <p>''From the seventh through the 12th hole,'' he said, ''that's probably the toughest test on the golf course in this wind.''</p>
        <p>After a three-putt bogey at the 406-yard 13th, Els had birdies at the 573-yard 14th and the 375-yard 15th.</p>
        <p>Even though David Duval shot a three-over-par 74 to fall to seven over par for the tournament, he gave the wind a positive spin.</p>
        <p>''For all the trouble it caused, at the same time I had a lot of fun,'' the No. 2 player in the world ranking said. ''I got to see what Pebble Beach is like in these conditions. I felt almost lucky to see it that way.''</p>
        <p>Asked if the Pebble Beach wind was different from, say, the wind at Augusta National during the Masters, Duval nodded.</p>
        <p>''What you encounter here,'' he said, ''it mostly blows strong and steady. I don't know if that's worse or not than the gusts you get at Augusta because sometimes you can catch it between the gusts.''</p>
        <p>Although Duval was too far back to win this Open, he insisted that Woods could be caught in Sunday's final round.</p>
        <p>''Tiger can be caught,'' he said. ''It's easy to shoot seven, eight or nine over and not hit many bad shots.''</p>
