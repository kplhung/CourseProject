        <p>THINK about the phrase ''great timing'' in an entertainment context and the name Jack Benny might come to mind. Perhaps Mae West or Rodney Dangerfield. But probably not Bill Lockwood.</p>
        <p>Yet in a career that has now spanned 40 years, Mr. Lockwood has become a master of timing -- not on the stage, but behind the scenes. For Mr. Lockwood has been the man who books acts into the McCarter Theater in Princeton and other top-drawer showcases in the area, and he has seen how public tastes can change radically, then change again. It is a business in which timing is everything.</p>
        <p>''Put someone like the Kodo Drummers on that stage 40 years ago and people would have looked at you like you were mad,'' Mr. Lockwood said, referring to the wild Japanese percussion ensemble. ''Today they sell out.''</p>
        <p>Just how remarkable it is that Mr. Lockwood has navigated the ever-changing entertainment waters for so long becomes clear when, in an interview in his cluttered McCarter office, he reflects on the early days. As he reminisces about booking the Kingston Trio and poetry readings by Carl Sandburg, he is surrounded by fliers for acts like the Shaolin Warriors, a martial-arts dance troupe, and Italy's Balletto di Toscana. That was then, this is now; Bill Lockwood has been there for all of it.</p>
        <p>''He's a sort of classic impresario, and there are very few left,'' said Jeffrey Woodward, the McCarter's managing director. ''One of the things that most impresses me about Bill is his range of knowledge. I don't know anybody who can be as articulate about dance, rock 'n' roll, world music, a whole range of things.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockwood books everything at the McCarter but the plays. These days that means an ambitious season of classical music, dance, jazz, world music and assorted things that defy classification, like the Flying Karamazov Brothers and the Peking Acrobats. That makes him one of the vital cogs in the cultural life of central New Jersey, where the McCarter has grown into a shining and innovative jewel.</p>
        <p>Busy as the 1,000-seat McCarter is, it is not the only institution to draw on Mr. Lockwood's expertise; his influence has stretched from one end of the New York-Philadelphia corridor to the other. For 28 years, starting in 1965, he assisted with programming at Lincoln Center, developing, among other things, its ''Mostly Mozart'' series -- this while working the McCarter job, zipping between the two on the train, often communicating via notes left in staff members' mail slots. (''I would be the mysterious force that no one would ever see,'' he said. ''There are people, I'm sure, today who wonder who I was.'')</p>
        <p>When the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark began taking shape, Mr. Lockwood's advice was sought on what acts to bring in and how to sell them; now he carries the title of principal programming associate there. Most recently he has become involved in planning the new Regional Performing Arts Center in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Princeton, though, remains his base, his anchor point. He grew up there, attended local schools, stayed for college at the university. It was, perhaps, the first example of good timing on his part, because he stumbled into an entertainment void.</p>
        <p>''At that time the McCarter was not a performing arts center as we know it now,'' he said. ''It just sort of sat there as a white elephant most of the time.''</p>
        <p>So as a senior in the fall of 1958, he and some other students decided to try to liven things up; they approached the university about bringing a few acts into the McCarter and other sites on campus. It was enough to give Mr. Lockwood a taste of the presenting business, and thus a career was born.</p>
        <p>Upon graduating, he and a classmate, Tom Sternberg, decided to put their rudimentary skills to use in San Francisco. They set up shop there at just the right moment to catch the change in the folk scene, presenting acts like Joan Baez and Peter, Paul and Mary. Leonard Bernstein came through, a superstar with a rabid following; Mr. Lockwood recalls people scrambling to retrieve his discarded cigarette butts. Buster Keaton, the silent-film legend, appeared in a tour of ''Once Upon a Mattress'' -- the kind of reminiscence that makes Mr. Lockwood regret that he didn't carry a tape recorder to catch the oral histories of the now-departed stars he has met.</p>
        <p>''I've never done that, never taken pictures or gotten autographs,'' he said. ''And all I have is the memories in here'' -- he points to his head.</p>
        <p>Princeton drew Mr. Lockwood back for good in 1963, and he went to work building and broadening the McCarter's program. It has been four decades of breaking down barriers, or more accurately, knowing the moment when a barrier was ready to fall.</p>
        <p>Dance once meant Martha Graham and a very few others. In the early 1970's Mr. Lockwood saw that it was ready to take a radically different direction and that there was an audience for this new type of work. He booked a young group out of Dartmouth called Pilobolus, and another called Alvin Ailey that arrived on campus in a Volkswagen bus.</p>
        <p>In the same way, world music -- long before the term came into use, of course -- once meant the Chieftans, and maybe Ravi Shankar. Now it's a staggering array of acts from all over the world. New Jersey's high levels of immigration helped tell Mr. Lockwood that there was a market for performers from Asia, Latin America, the former Soviet Union, but less obvious was a change in the mainstream middle-class audiences.</p>
        <p>''People are fascinated increasingly by the art forms and the cultures of other lands,'' he said. And so when the Indian musician Vilayat Khan, for instance, played the McCarter, only about half of the audience was drawn from the immigrant population in the area.</p>
        <p>Which, for Mr. Lockwood, is part of the fun -- there's nothing he likes better than exposing New Jersey audiences to an exciting new act he has seen on one of his countless trips into New York or to some festival. (''The homework in this business,'' he said, ''is not reading academic journals, it's going to see a performance somewhere.'') What he has noticed, though, is that some audiences are more willing to experiment than others.</p>
        <p>Fans of jazz, for instance, are fearless; they may have been raised on familiar names like Brubeck, but they will readily give an unknown act a try. The dance audience, too, seems eager to broaden its horizons, which is why the dance portion of the schedules Mr. Lockwood puts together reads like a geography textbook -- Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, Ballet Folklorico de Mexico, Veriovka Ukrainian National Song and Dance Ensemble. An adventurous audience is contagious; if jazz or dance is greeted enthusiastically one year, the offerings grow even more the next.</p>
        <p>But trying to get the staid classical music crowd to branch out is another matter entirely. Someone who is in the habit of going to see a symphony playing a familiar program may not easily embrace the unknown, Mr. Lockwood has found. And the street runs two ways -- there is a limited amount of new blood flowing in.</p>
        <p>''It's the audience I'm most worried about,'' he said, ''because it's the audience that's not growing.'' Classical music is rarely played in the average home, and music education has taken a back seat in many schools, he said, which does not help matters.</p>
        <p>Still, there is something for everybody, including the symphony lover, in the seasons Mr. Lockwood puts together. They are an amazing amalgam of old and new, long-established stars and up-and-comers -- deliberately so, because Mr. Lockwood long ago realized that known names can't survive without new acts and vice versa. So the Chieftans, Sweet Honey in the Rock, Alvin Ailey and a parade of others -- once the pioneers, now the known quantities -- come regularly, anchors in a season also dotted with newcomers. ''Certain things are a bond: you cash them in every year,'' Mr. Lockwood said. ''But you also have to keep priming the pump.''</p>
        <p>The difference Mr. Lockwood's work has made is not lost on those who know the arts. He is seen as having been pivotal in helping New Jersey shed its stepsister image. ''Bill Lockwood has made an immeasurable contribution to the cultural climate and landscape of New Jersey by bringing first to his beloved McCarter Theater and then to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center the very finest artists available,'' said Barbara J. Russo, executive director of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts. ''They have delighted us, challenged us, and opened up new vistas for us. He has proved that one need not cross the Delaware or Hudson in order to find world-class artistry.''</p>
        <p>John McGoldrick, an executive vice president at Bristol-Myers Squibb who has attended events at the McCarter for years, said he has been impressed with Mr. Lockwood's range. ''He has personally a breadth and depth of knowledge that is amazing,'' Mr. McGoldrick said. ''One of the extraordinary things about the man, which he has brought to us, the consumers, is this variety. He is attuned to the Grateful Dead and to the most refined English choral music.''</p>
        <p>Many of the established stars Mr. Lockwood brings in routinely sell out far larger houses, but they come back to Princeton anyway. The relationships they have built with Mr. Lockwood have a lot to do with that. ''As we are maturing as an organization, it's also nice to see that some people can stay with you over the long run,'' said Robby Barnett, a founder of Pilobolus. ''Certainly we don't mean the same thing to Bill Lockwood now as we did when we were college students. To be followed with some interest over this number of years by someone is very nice for us. Bill remains interested in what we do, and that's certainly very gratifying.''</p>
        <p>Treating an artist right, Mr. Lockwood said, can go a long way toward ensuring a return visit -- the pianist George Winston, for instance, prefers to rehearse from midnight till dawn, so the staff makes sure he can get into the theater then. But, more fundamentally, performing is still a business where loyalty counts. ''Perhaps you presented them early in their careers, when they were not the flavor of the month,'' he said. ''These are things people remember. It's a business of relationships that you develop and you nurture over the years, and you don't exploit.''</p>
        <p>That Mr. Lockwood has decades' worth of such relationships made him a natural person to call when NJPAC started taking shape in the mid-1990's. He was, he admits, a hard sell.</p>
        <p>''When they first talked about a performing arts center in Newark, I pooh-poohed it along with a lot of other people,'' he said. ''I said there's no way it's ever going to happen, they're never going to raise the money for it, and they're never going to build it, certainly not there. Wrong on all counts.''</p>
        <p>Helping to come up with a program for a new space in an untested market was, he said, one of the most invigorating challenges he has faced. There were concerns among artists who were approached for bookings: Why should they come to Newark? Who would come to see them there? There were concerns among his friends at Lincoln Center and other New York venues: Would the ''new gorilla'' draw away their audiences? And there was a new population to get to know.</p>
        <p>''Essentially NJPAC was a cultural field of dreams,'' he said. ''If you build it, will they come? Well they have come. We've totally proved the skeptics wrong, including myself.''</p>
        <p>And, he said, among the most gratifying things is that the audience apparently is not being drawn away from places like Lincoln Center. It is, for the most part, made up of people who gave up going to New York ages ago, or people who are discovering cultural offerings for the first time. A tipoff, he said, is the small fact that NJPAC audiences sometimes applaud between movements of a symphony, something unheard of in the great New York halls. They like what they're hearing, so they clap.</p>
        <p>''It drives me crazy,'' he said, ''but I'm happy to have them there, and I'm happy to have them applaud, especially if it means they will come back and are having an experience that they find meaningful in some way, enriching in some way. It's a fresh audience; it's not the dyed-in-the-wool audience that has always gone to New York.''</p>
        <p>Now he is helping with a similar start-from-scratch effort in Philadelphia, getting to know a new audience with new demographics. Trying, again, to have the right timing, to change with an ever-changing business.</p>
        <p>Sometimes it seems the changes will never stop, in all segments of the job. Once, even before the McCarter had a box office, tickets were sold out of the university store; now e-sales are the coming thing, and people sometimes inquire about tickets before a show has even been announced because they have read about the date on the performer's Web site. Once, booking Carl Sandburg meant simply calling him or his publisher and setting a date; now booking is a logistical nightmare. A symphony or an act from overseas might book two years in advance, while a lone singer or a jazz trio might be looking only a few months ahead.</p>
        <p>It may be dizzying, but for Mr. Lockwood there is a constant at the heart of it: no matter how big television screens get, no matter how clear the home-stereo sound, audiences will always have a need to go to a theater and see a play, a dance, a concert.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing that replaces a live orchestra in a hall,'' he said. ''It's the same reason video has been no substitute for going to the movies. It's because it's a communal experience, sharing the laughter or the pain or whatever it might be. In the end, there's no substitute for a live performance.''</p>
