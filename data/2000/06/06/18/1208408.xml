        <p>BY any standard measure of democracy, Russia now more than ever desperately needs a credible political opposition. But until last week, President Vladimir V. Putin didn't really have any -- not in the Parliament, not in the regions, not among top business leaders, and certainly not among a population that, more than anything, wants someone to put their unruly society in order.</p>
        <p>After ten years of democratic bedlam, many Russians seem to have rediscovered an ancient yearning to obey that makes them a perfect match for Mr. Putin, a K.G.B. veteran who prefers loyal servants to political partners in this vast and cumbersome country.</p>
        <p>But now, with the jailing last Tuesday of Vladimir A. Gusinsky, Mr. Putin may have actually stirred up some real opposition. Mr. Gusinsky was charged with embezzlement and released Friday. And as the Gusinsky affair moves to its next, more political, phase, the spotlight will be on Mr. Putin's ability to handle a challenge that has now spread far beyond the boundaries of Mr. Gusinsky's media empire.</p>
        <p>There was a time, during Boris Yeltsin's tenure as president, when Mr. Gusinsky -- himself no slouch at the rough and cynical game of Russian power politics -- enjoyed the Kremlin's favor. But by the time of his arrest, his media empire had become a rare, if not the last, center of resistance to the Putin political machine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky made his dramatic break more than a year ago, when he and his media outlets took aim at Mr. Yeltsin's cozy cabal of insiders and intriguers, henceforth labeled the Family. As the Family's fortunes kept rising, together with Mr. Putin's popularity and eventual election, Mr. Gusinsky fell ever further from favor.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Putin set about bringing his other political opponents to heel. Some, like the governor of St. Petersburg, Vladimir Yakovlev, jumped into his lap; others like Mayor Yuri Luzhkov in Moscow needed first to be shown their place before they were allowed back into the inner circle. The rest of Russia's rambunctious governors will be reined in by new laws that tighten the Kremlin's control of the regions through the installation of seven superloyal ''supergovernors.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gusinsky -- whose television station has not only criticized the president and his war in Chechnya, but also regularly mocked him on a popular Sunday-night puppet show -- never even got a chance to make amends. According to Kremlin insiders, Mr. Putin has frequently wondered aloud why Gazprom, Russia's half-state-owned natural gas company and a shareholder in Mr. Gusinsky's Media-MOST, should help subsidize  flagrant ''anti-state'' thinking.</p>
        <p>Even this sliver of an opposition seems to irk Mr. Putin, who, unlike Mr. Yeltsin, shuns confrontation and bristles at criticism. Mr. Yeltsin's eight years in power were marked by his running fight with a Communist opposition, and by his laissez-faire approach to other power centers -- in the regions, in the press or among Russia's rapacious capitalists, known as the oligarchs.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Putin rose to power, riding a wave of nationalism let loose by the Chechen war, these alternate power centers offered no resistance. The Communists, who have long posed as Russian patriots, were hard-pressed to challenge Mr. Putin's bellicosity in Chechnya. The liberal intelligentsia (including some of the press) was alarmed by Mr. Putin's background and his sometimes dim understanding of democratic norms, but they no longer carry much weight in a society which, after the disappointments of the last ten years, views liberal Western values with suspicion. Businesses are hoping Mr. Putin will abide by his promise to restore the rule of law and treat them equally (though others point out that his words were ''dictatorship of the law'').</p>
        <p>Then, last Tuesday, while Mr. Putin was in Madrid dining with the Spanish royal family, Mr. Gusinsky was thrown into one of Russia's toughest and most antiquated jails. Whether the charges are eventually proved or not, they are widely considered here to be a pretext to finish off the last of the anti-Kremlin opposition.</p>
        <p>But if that was indeed the plan, events don't seem to be cooperating. Politicians, journalists and businessmen have rushed for the microphones to denounce the move against Mr. Gusinsky, a media magnate who also happens to be a leader of Russia's Jewish community. Suddenly Mr. Putin's hold on Russia's slippery political scene looks less firm than it did just a week ago.</p>
        <p>POLITICIANS and journalists condemned the arrest, but perhaps the most significant voices  were those of 17 representatives of big business -- oligarchs -- who signed an open letter of protest to Mr. Putin. ''They are looking at Gusinsky's story as if in a mirror,'' said Grigory V. Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal-democratic Yabloko party.</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Putin himself ordered the arrest, or whether he was set up by schemers inside the Family, he stands a good chance of coming out a loser. If he distances himself from the arrest, many Russians say, he could look weak, even foolish. If he supports it, he will confirm every Russian democrat's worst fears about the dangers of putting a former K.G.B. officer in charge. Some commentators have noted that the arrest of Mr. Gusinsky may actually be popular: most Russians hate rich businessmen, particularly if they are Jewish.</p>
        <p>But opinion polls are not what drives politics in Russia: politics here are a zero-sum game, which is all about getting power, not sharing it. In a front page editorial, Vitaly Tretyakov, editor of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, summed up the stakes: ''Either Gusinsky is right, and the Kremlin is wrong, or the Kremlin is right and Gusinsky is wrong. The one who will win this juridical, political and propaganda war will be right. The winner will take all.''</p>
