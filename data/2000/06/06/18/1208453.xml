        <p>Malia Mills, 33, founded Malia Mills Swimwear in 1992 while she was a waitress. Her suits, which sell for about $150 apiece, are among the best-selling swimwear lines at Saks Fifth Avenue, Barneys and Bloomingdale's stores across the country. Part of the line's appeal is that the Malia Mills catalog features civilian models with the figure problems of average women, not swimsuit models with perfect physiques.</p>
        <p>MY first job when I got to New York was waitressing at Odeon, a cafe in Lower Manhattan. I was also designing swimsuits, and I lived around the corner from the restaurant. I would wait tables and when the FedEx man would show up, I would put down my pad and pencil in midorder and go pick up my packages. I don't know if the restaurant customers were crazy about my leaving.</p>

        <p>MY first job when I got to New York was waitressing at Odeon, a cafe in Lower Manhattan. I was also designing swimsuits, and I lived around the corner from the restaurant. I would wait tables and when the FedEx man would show up, I would put down my pad and pencil in midorder and go pick up my packages. I don't know if the restaurant customers were crazy about my leaving.</p>
        <p>The job that really informed my work was right before I started waitressing, when I was a design assistant for Jessica McClintock in 1991. She started her dress business in the 1960's as a counterculture alternative to the wedding dress, for all her friends who were getting married in cow fields. I was a glorified gofer. I would have to take a sketch to the manufacturer and make sure the sample was made in the right way, bring it back, model it -- everything.</p>
        <p>Occasionally a model would disappear, and Jessica's voice would boom over the intercom: Malia, please come up here immediately. And you'd go upstairs and put on some gigantic confection of a dress and stand there and spin around the room while she made notes.</p>
        <p>When I was a student at Cornell, I studied apparel design, rather than fashion design, so the curriculum was more about having a critical eye and knowing where to cut costs and when to be strictly utilitarian. We had to design everything from chemical warfare helmets to prom gowns to scuba suits.</p>
        <p>Designing bathing suits is very much about problem solving. And women tend to think there are a lot of problems when it comes to deciding what to wear when they sit by the pool.  MY FIRST JOB</p>
