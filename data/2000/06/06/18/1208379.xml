        <p>As a boy, Victor Cox used to leave his apartment on 100th Street in East Harlem and play sandlot baseball in the vacant lot across the street. It wasn't ideal.</p>
        <p>''There was glass, garbage,'' he recalled. ''We used to pick up the garbage, get it out of the way, and we used to play.''</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Cox, 36, a hospital clerk, coaches on the same vacant lot, three and a half acres on First Avenue between 100th and 101st Streets surrounded by drab public housing and century-old tenements. But his young charges field pop flies and smash hits on two well-manicured diamonds complete with thick grass and infielders' dirt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cox is one of 75 coaches who volunteer for Harlem R.B.I., the local branch of Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities, a national nonprofit group that promotes baseball and tutorial programs in neighborhoods where the game's popularity had waned. After eight years at the East Harlem site, the organization has grown to include 350 children and 20 teams, and its budget has increased from $75,000 to $550,000.</p>
        <p>But R.B.I.'s executive director, Richard Berlin, said the league was being threatened by a plan to develop the property. The city-owned land has been zoned for housing for decades, but Mr. Berlin and the league's coaches wonder why another of the neighborhood's many vacant lots cannot offer an alternative site.</p>
        <p>''We certainly recognize the need for housing in Upper Manhattan, and the shortage in East Harlem in particular,'' Mr. Berlin said. ''On the other hand, there's almost no open space for kids to play on.''</p>
        <p>Richard Roberts, commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, noted that the league had been given interim use of the field with the understanding that the land would one day be used for much-needed housing. Under a 1998 agreement, housing would go on the parcel nearest First Avenue. The remaining property, between First and Second Avenues, would still be used by the league.</p>
        <p>''What they have there now are two interim sites,'' Mr. Roberts said, ''and what we agreed to do is leave them one permanent site.'' The city has allocated $2 million to upgrade two other ball fields for the league, on East 96th Street and East 120th Street.</p>
        <p>The city, which plans to build 150 middle-income apartments, will seek bids from developers this month. The plan is supported by East Harlem among community leaders and local politicians.</p>
        <p>''One thing that we have in East Harlem is vacant lots,'' said David Givens, chairman of Community Board 11, ''and there's a feeling in East Harlem that the league can move to another location.''</p>
        <p>The young ballplayers could not disagree more. ''This is the best thing to happen to this community,'' said Jeffrey Parker, 15, looking across an expanse of green one recent day before practice. ''Not a lot of good things happen around here, and this is a place to come and get away.''</p>
