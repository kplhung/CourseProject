        <p>Diamond Hunt</p>
        <p>Q. A few years back, I was watching a TV show about gems that mentioned a state park in the South that was open to the public for diamond hunting. Do you know where it is? -- Patti Winston, Savage, Minn.</p>
        <p>A. Your fortune may await you at Crater of Diamonds State Park, on State Highway 301 near Murfreesboro in southwestern Arkansas. It is 120 miles from Little Rock (not a very encouraging name for a diamond hunter -- but, on a more positive note, not too far from a place called Hope). Open daily except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. most days, and to 8 p.m. May 26 to Sept. 3; (870) 285-3113, fax (870) 285-4169.</p>

        <p>Diamond Hunt</p>
        <p>Q. A few years back, I was watching a TV show about gems that mentioned a state park in the South that was open to the public for diamond hunting. Do you know where it is? -- Patti Winston, Savage, Minn.</p>
        <p>A. Your fortune may await you at Crater of Diamonds State Park, on State Highway 301 near Murfreesboro in southwestern Arkansas. It is 120 miles from Little Rock (not a very encouraging name for a diamond hunter -- but, on a more positive note, not too far from a place called Hope). Open daily except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. most days, and to 8 p.m. May 26 to Sept. 3; (870) 285-3113, fax (870) 285-4169.</p>
        <p>The diamond-search area is a 36.5-acre field of diamond-bearing soil called lamporite. Weather permitting, the soil is plowed routinely to make it easier to sift through. Tickets to search for diamonds are $4.50, $2 ages 6 to 12, and can be bought at the visitor center; they are good only on the day of purchase, unless bought after 6 p.m. Park officials say you can sometimes find diamonds on the surface, so tools aren't required. But you can bring digging tools (nothing with a motor on it), buy a small trowel or cultivator for $1.37 each at the park, or rent larger shovels and soil-sifting screens.</p>
        <p>There are 60 campsites in the park, all with water and electrical hookups, and they cost $13.50 a night. Two bathhouses contain hot showers and modern restrooms. Except for holiday weekends, the park says, reservations usually aren't necessary.</p>
        <p>What are your chances of walking out of the park looking as if you're ready for the Oscar presentations? The first diamonds were found on the property in 1906, a 3-carat white diamond and 1.5-carat yellow diamond. Soon after, the owner sold the land for $36,000 and a diamond rush quickly followed. From 1907 to the late 1930's, several commercial mining operations were tried on the 80-acre deposit, and all failed. Since 1949, the site has been operated as a tourist attraction, with the state taking over in 1972.</p>
        <p>The largest stone ever found at the site was the Uncle Sam diamond, mined commercially in 1924. The white diamond weighed 40.23 carats rough and was cut into an emerald-shaped stone of 12.42 carats. The largest one found since it became a state park was 16.37-carat rough white diamond, cut into a marquise of 7.54 carats. In 1998, a 7.28-carat white diamond was found by a woman searching the surface of the soil.</p>
        <p>Point and Click</p>
        <p>Q. In the fall, my wife and I plan to visit five Asian countries, including Japan. I usually try to brush up on the local language, but not this time. I have heard of a little pocket-size folder with pictures on it that you can point to in order to be understood. Is it polite to use these? And if so, where can I get them? -- Joel Peck, Morganville, N.J.</p>
        <p>A. Although we've been taught it's not polite to point, Japan is a country where many restaurants keep plastic models of various dishes on display so customers can point to what they want. So keep that index finger limber.</p>
        <p>Langenscheidt Publishers sells foreign-language phrase cards. Each one packs about 200 phrases on a  pocket-size laminated card. They come in several languages, including Japanese and Filipino, and cost $1.99 each from Hagstrom Map and Travel Center, 57 West 43rd Street, New York, N.Y. 10036; (212) 398-1222 or (800) 432-6277.</p>
        <p>The Hagstrom store also sells two folding guides with pictographs for $5.95 each. One, by Langenscheidt, is in a small book form. The other is a laminated folding card.</p>
        <p>And the Japan National Tourist Organization, (212) 757-5640, offers two free aids. ''Tourist Language Handbook'' has 17 pages with phrases in English and Japanese; ''Hello, Japan'' contains 100 pages of pictograms, travel tips and points of etiquette.</p>
        <p>Kansas City Jazz</p>
        <p>Q. I will be returning to Kansas City, Mo., this summer for my 50th high school reunion. While there, I want to hear live jazz. Do you know of any clubs I can go to? -- Jerome Evans, South Lake Tahoe, Calif.</p>
        <p>A. John Niccum, the music editor of Pitch Weekly, a free newspaper in  Kansas City with extensive arts listings, says that on most nights, there are about a dozen clubs and restaurants in the city with live jazz. He suggested four clubs.</p>
        <p>Club Mardi Gras, at 19th and Vine, (816) 842-8463, is in the 10th and Vine Historic District. The original jazz club at that site, also called the Mardi Gras, opened in 1929, and various jazz clubs have operated there on and off ever since. There's music on Friday and Saturday nights from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. with a $3 cover and no minimum. Fridays are usually reserved for traditional Kansas City jazz, with Saturday given over to the blues. Groups are usually four to seven pieces. One wall is decorated with the original 1929 mural depicting a Mardi Gras parade. Louisiana-style food is served.</p>
        <p>Two blocks from the convention center, the Majestic Steakhouse, 931  Broadway, (816) 471-8484, is in the basement of a restaurant. Live jazz is presented nightly, with swing and bebop the specialties. Music starts  6:30 weeknights, 7 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 5 p.m. Sunday, and usually stops at 10:30 to 11 p.m. There is no cover or minimum. The building, dating from 1910, is on the National Register of Historic Places, and it has tile floors and tin ceilings. You can eat at the restaurant upstairs or in the jazz club, and a cigar club occupies the third floor.</p>
        <p>For a more intimate setting, try the Phoenix Piano Bar and Grill, 302  West Eighth Street, (816) 472-0001. Swing jazz and blues are the preferred forms here, with four- to five-piece groups the norm. Music is offered Monday to Saturday, usually until 1 a.m., but if you want a seat, the owners suggest you get there by 6 p.m. Besides table seating (pasta, steak and seafood are on the menu), you can sit at the bar or around the piano. There is no cover charge or minimum.</p>
        <p>The Club at Plaza 3, 4749 Pennsylvania Avenue, (816) 753-0000, is in the Country Club Plaza. This is a  steakhouse, with the music presented on the lower level Wednesday through Saturday. Performances start at about 7 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday and 8:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday and last about four hours. Weeknights typically feature three-piece groups, with larger groups (up to 11 musicians) on weekends. Dinner is available, and there is cocktail-table seating, too. The $5 cover charge is waived if you order dinner; there's no minimum.</p>
