        <p>THINK of the numbers that matter most when you apply for credit. You know your date of birth, Social Security number and annual income well enough, and you may know just how much money you have in the bank. But the make-or-break figure is one that lenders are privy to but that you have probably never seen: your credit score.</p>
        <p>The veil is lifting from this mysterious metric, in response to pressure by consumer groups, by legislation before Congress and by loan-service Web sites like E-Loan that were eager to spill the beans to customers. Fair, Isaac, the San Rafael, Calif., company that pioneered credit scoring 40 years ago and dominates the field today, has published on its own Web site, www.fairisaac.com, its general recipe for scoring consumer credit.</p>
        <p>The factors considered are payment history (35 percent of the overall score); amounts and types of outstanding debt (30 percent); length of credit history (15 percent);  amount of new credit recently sought or gained (10 percent); and types of credit in use (10 percent). Points are added to yield a score that ranges from the 300's to the 900's -- the higher, the better.</p>
        <p>In large part, Fair, Isaac's recipe confirms popular notions of what good credit means: that people who borrow moderately and pay on time can expect to score better than those who borrow to the limit or not at all, or those who chronically pay late. But some idiosyncrasies and potential pitfalls revealed in the scoring system may surprise consumers.</p>
        <p>Moves to remove credit blemishes, for example, may not help, or may even backfire. Closing an account that you once paid late won't remove it from consideration. And say you  think you are carrying too much debt on too many credit cards, so you get a loan from a personal finance company to consolidate the debt into a single, easier-to manage payment. A good move? Not for your credit score: finance-company loans are considered a greater sign of risk than owing the same amount on credit cards. On top of that, if you consolidate the debt into one loan and close the credit card accounts, you have reduced the credit available to you without reducing the amount you owe, which hurts your score.</p>
        <p>Consider a consumer who always pays her credit card balances in full each month. Her credit scores will rise, based on zero card debt, right? Wrong. The scoring system generally picks up the balances on her most recent statements -- before she has paid them. So if she racks up a lot of charges each month -- say, to earn bonuses like airline miles -- it is possible that her score will be pulled down a bit by what the formula considers heavy debt relative to her credit limit, even if she has never missed a payment.</p>
        <p>Even shopping aggressively online for the best rate on a new loan can lower your score. Each time you enter personal information like your income and Social Security number on a Web site's form, it may be reported to credit bureaus as a credit inquiry. Too many credit inquiries will count against you, though Fair, Isaac said it had taken steps to collapse multiple inquiries for a particular loan over a short period into a single hit for scoring purposes.</p>
        <p>''Inquiries are not enough to make or break someone's score,'' said Cheri St. John, a senior vice president of Fair, Isaac, who oversees its credit bureau scoring services unit. Still, she advises, ''only shop for and accept the credit you need.''</p>
        <p>For years, consumers setting out to establish credit were told that more credit is better, a myth ''that took a while to dispel,'' Ms. St. John said. In fact, getting too much credit at once makes a person appear risky, she said; building up gradually and establishing a good payment history is a better approach.</p>
        <p>While Fair, Isaac provides the models used to calculate scores, it does not have access to credit bureau data on individuals. The scores are used in three out of four mortgage originations as well as for other kinds of loans; a score in the middle 600's is generally high enough to get a mortgage on favorable terms.  Keith T. Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a research firm in Butler, N.J., said the federally sponsored mortgage agencies, like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, use 620 as a cutoff for high-quality loans.</p>
        <p>As a result, loans below that score are harder to package and sell, so many mortgage lenders will deny credit or charge higher interest rates, added fees and more points up front, Mr. Gumbinger said. But contrary to popular belief, he said, in the mortgage world, ''there's almost no benefit for having a better score'' than 620.</p>
        <p>For now, the only way a consumer can obtain his or her current credit score is from a lender, which will usually reveal the score only when an application is denied. Starting next month, consumers who know their scores can get an explanatory report on the Fair, Isaac Web site; people who do not know their scores can have their lenders provide them to Fair, Isaac on their behalf, and then pass along the explanation.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Fair, Isaac said, it would like to be able to provide scores directly to consumers. And later this year, Trans Union, one of the three major credit bureaus, plans to create its own credit scores and explain the results to consumers.</p>
        <p>Raising Your Score</p>
        <p>Here are some ways to put your best foot forward in the complex arithmetic of credit scoring.</p>
        <p>Apply sparingly. Seek credit only when you need it, not on a whim.</p>
        <p>Don't change indiscriminately. Putting all your spending on a credit card can make you look deep in debt, even if you pay it all off each month.</p>
        <p>Avoid maxing out. Using all your available credit makes you look risky; either borrow less or have your limit raised.</p>
        <p>Pay on time. Late payments do more to hurt your score than almost anything short of default and bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Inspect your credit report. Errors and omissions in credit bureau data are common.</p>
