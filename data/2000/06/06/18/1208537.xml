      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>History tell us that Genghis Khan's Mongolian hordes swept out of the Gobi desert in the 13th century, their sights set on Europe. Now comes a restaurant that suggests that far from dreaming of domination, all the dust-coated horsemen really wanted to do was teach the West to do barbecue right. At Gobi Grill, Mongolian barbecue is the main attraction. At the end of a busy day in the desert, say legends posted here, Genghis's men used their razor-sharp weapons to carve up local game and vegetables, which they grilled on their shields. The tradition lives on in the form of the tava, a flat, round skillet perfect for grilling meals. Diners here assemble their own, plucking thinly shaved meats like lamb, chicken, beef and seafood from a cart, tossing in a variety of fresh vegetables, and ladling on one of four sauces and assorted condiments. Garlic water, anyone? Next, you slip your bowl into the kitchen through a slot beneath a glass window, a chef heaps your selections onto a smoking skillet and cooks it with the aid of elongated chopsticks as you watch. Who knew such a simple ritual could be so fascinating? And, for that matter, who knew you could grill Asian noodles? Later, diners cradling their steaming bowls hurry back to their seats to feast under a tentlike structure called a ger. The cost is $12.95, and yes, you can go back for more, though I've never gotten past my second bowl. Meals fit for a conqueror can be filling.</p>
