A smart, absorbing story collection (the author's first) in which young men discover that the world is an impossible place, at least right now: ''Sex is never normal with anyone,'' as one of them puts it. ''It's bizarre. It's wiggly meats.''</p>
        <p>VERTIGO, by W. G. Sebald. (New Directions, $23.95.) An unclassifiable, wholly original book whose author (German born, lives in England) reflects on ever-expanding chunks of European history to examine his own origins and inner life.</p>

        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>AMERICAN PHARAOH. Mayor Richard J. Daley: His Battle for Chicago and the Nation, by Adam Cohen and Elizabeth Taylor. (Little, Brown, $26.95.) A life of a man many urban experts consider his city's savior, not just the Great Satan of the 1968 Democratic National Convention.</p>
        <p>DIANA MOSLEY, by Jan Dalley. (Knopf, $27.50.) A straightforward biography of one of the fabulous Mitford sisters, one who crossed over from colorful to weird and made her life with Sir Oswald Mosley, the British fascist leader.</p>
        <p>EXPERIENCE, by Martin Amis. (Talk Miramax/ Hyperion, $23.95.) The novelist's nonfictional coming-of-age narrative, dense with personal history, firm opinions, literary gossip, name-dropping, wild regret, activist dentistry and Amis's father, Kingsley Amis.</p>
        <p>HALF A HEART, by Rosellen Brown. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $24.) Civil rights activist in the 1960's, prosperous householder in the 80's, this novel's white heroine, longing for wholeness, seeks out the black daughter she once ran out on.</p>
        <p>JIM THE BOY, by Tony Earley. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) A first novel, a coming-of-age novel, a Southern novel -- and yet no monsters, no parental abuse, erotic turmoil or domestic dysfunction! This clear, balanced, understated book makes growing up seem somehow possible.</p>
        <p>THE OBITUARY WRITER, by Porter Shreve. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $12.) A lean, noirish first novel about a very junior journalist who comes to know a widow whose male associates seem to keep disappearing.</p>
        <p>PAPAL SIN: Structures of Deceit, by Garry Wills. (Doubleday, $25.) An argument, angry and sorrowful, by a Roman Catholic who thinks the concentration of authority in the pope has led to ever more lamentable cover-ups of mistakes and assertions of things that are not so.</p>
        <p>SAM THE CAT: And Other Stories, by Matthew Klam. (Random House, $22.95.) A smart, absorbing story collection (the author's first) in which young men discover that the world is an impossible place, at least right now: ''Sex is never normal with anyone,'' as one of them puts it. ''It's bizarre. It's wiggly meats.''</p>
        <p>VERTIGO, by W. G. Sebald. (New Directions, $23.95.) An unclassifiable, wholly original book whose author (German born, lives in England) reflects on ever-expanding chunks of European history to examine his own origins and inner life.</p>
        <p>WHAT I THINK I DID: A Season of Survival in Two Acts, by Larry Woiwode. (Basic Books, $25.) A memoir of two worlds, murderously blizzard-prone North Dakota and aspiring, literary New York, connected by the author's presence in both and by a series of religious experiences.</p>
