        <p>These days, the quaint shopping district here bustles on Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
        <p>Couples saunter down East Ridgewood Avenue -- the men in chinos and deck shoes and the women with sweaters draped fashionably over their shoulders -- eating ice cream from Haagen-Dazs and looking in the windows of shops like Ann Taylor and Duxiana that have long made this village an alternative to the nearby malls.</p>
        <p>But what has really drawn so many people in recent years, business and government leaders agree, has been a boom in the number and variety of restaurants, from California Nouvelle to Thai.</p>
        <p>Since the early 1990's, when this six-square-mile village of 25,000 became the first in North Jersey to pass an ordinance allowing outdoor restaurants, the number has jumped from a half-dozen or so to at least 35. And that is not counting the pizzerias, bakeries and cafes -- including the first Starbucks to open in New Jersey -- which the Board of Health categorizes as restaurants because they offer seating. That definition would make it 55.</p>
        <p>All of which has given Ridgewood added cachet as the area's restaurant capital, attracting people from beyond the small towns that dot Bergen County to shop and eat and stroll.</p>
        <p>''There aren't too many other places to eat that have the variety and setting, the nice ambience, and nice shops,'' said John Holly of Hackettstown, who spent a recent Friday night dining at Trattoria Fratelli with Jennifer Gallagher of Hawthorne.</p>
        <p>Of course, the surge in dining and shopping here has created a familiar problem: increased traffic and a severe parking shortage. That has caused some residents to question if success is not spoiling what had once been a more sedate town.</p>
        <p>''I call it the Manhattanization of Ridgewood,'' Edward C. Norton, a former Ridgewood resident, said in a telephone interview from his home on Cape Cod. ''It had specialty shops catering to a fairly affluent clientele in the period when we were there, but it changed with more chain stores and restaurants coming in. And the affluence pushed the house prices into the stratosphere.''</p>
        <p>Art Wrubel, a retired architect and city planner who is chairman of the Ridgewood Historic Preservation Commission, said the strongest attribute of the downtown area, which he calls ''the jewel of Ridgewood,'' has always been that it is compact and predestrian-friendly.</p>
        <p>''However,'' Mr. Wrubel said, ''that walkability and compactness is being threatened by the lack of adequate circulation and parking.'' He added, ''I wouldn't call it a crisis, but I would call it a significant problem.''</p>
        <p>While the population has dropped by about 3,000 from 30 years ago, he added, traffic has increased significantly because people are making more car trips today -- 3.69 a day per driver in Bergen County, one of the highest in the region.</p>
        <p>''If these trends continue, the downtown area will become more and more congested and there will be conflict between autos trying to park and pedestrians trying to enjoy downtown,'' Mr. Wrubel added.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the arrival of the restaurants and such chains as the Gap and Laura Ashley contributed to higher rents, pushing  some family-owned stores out of business.</p>
        <p>''I regret the loss of all the hardware stores,'' said John Scarry, an English professor at the City University of New York, who has lived here for 25 years. ''We've lost a lot. And what have we replaced it with? Anyone looking at 50 restaurants and no hardware store has to wonder.''</p>
        <p>Still, most people here seem to be comfortable with the changing landscape. ''We created more of a parking problem than we had, but that's a good type of problem,'' said Mayor Patrick A.Mancuso. ''I remember in '92 when we had empty stores.''</p>
        <p>That was when Paul Callan, deputy mayor at the time, saw how sidewalk restaurants in Manhattan were thriving and approached council with the idea.</p>
        <p>''Ridgewood is a very old-line conservative town and it was very difficult to convince old-time residents,'' Mr. Callan said. ''There was a lot of opposition at first.''</p>
        <p>But, he added, ''It was an immediate, stunning success and, I think, contributed to the viability of the downtown area.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, a Chamber of Commerce survey taken last year on a special late shopping night showed that of 35 people interviewed, 10 percent came to shop but the majority, 46 percent, came to dine, said Angela Cautillo, the executive director. Of those 35 people, only 23 percent were from Ridgewood.</p>
        <p>At first, relations between longtime shop owners and the arrivistes were strained. Some chamber members went so far as to ask the village five years ago -- to no avail -- to limit the number of restaurants.</p>
        <p>Today, many merchants have taken advantage of the increased pedestrian traffic by staying open later on Fridays or Saturdays. Bookends, for instance, a family-owned store on East Ridgewood Avenue, has survived for 16 years in a town where at least two other bookstores have failed.</p>
        <p>Dana Gilligan, one of the owners, said the store's success had come in part through flexible hours and author signings -- from former President Jimmy Carter, who drew large crowds, to the wrestler The Rock, who had devotees backed up for blocks.</p>
        <p>''Some summer weekends when the weather is beautiful we'll even stay open to 10:30 at night,'' Ms. Gilligan said.</p>
        <p>Blame for the some of the parking problem has been placed on restaurants, which  employ more people than shops do. Lawrence W. Gleckel, who owns the Artists' Gallery on Oak Street, situated across from several popular restaurants, said his business had been hurt by the parking shortage.</p>
        <p>''Every day, a minimum of 33 percent of the spots on this street alone -- that's ll of 33 spots -- are taken by employees' or owners' cars,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So far, critics say, attempts at a solution have been piecemeal measures like permit parking in 90 spaces in a municipal lot for store and restaurant employees.</p>
        <p>Jane Reilly, a councilwoman who recently won re-election at the head of a ticket that promised to address quality-of-life issues like parking, pedestrian safety and speeding on residential streets, said she would call for a comprehensive traffic and parking study when the council reorganized next month.</p>
        <p>For now, residents are learning to work around the problems, like running errands during the week, when the village is less congested.</p>
        <p>Or there is Harlan Coben, an Edgar Award-winning mystery writer here who  can be found working in a downtown coffee shop almost every day.</p>
        <p>''I just sit there with my coffee and I bring a laptop sometimes or a notebook,'' Mr. Coben said. ''The book that's coming out this week, 'Darkest Fear,' I wrote three-fourths of that in Starbucks and the Ridgewood Coffee Company.''</p>
