        <p>IF there is an intellectual center of big business, it is the immaculately maintained faux-Georgian campus of Harvard Business School, for nearly a century the training ground for the people who run and advise the world's largest companies. From turning out future chief executives of I.B.M., Merck and Procter &amp; Gamble to being the home of strategy gurus like Michael E. Porter, Harvard has practically stamped its crest on the large industrial companies that defined the 20th-century economy.</p>
        <p>But ''the West Point of capitalism,'' as the school is known, has spent the last few years behaving like anything but an academy of big business. Instead, Harvard has undergone a transformation worthy of the case studies that are the hallmark of its M.B.A. curriculum. This one goes something like this: Fearing new kinds of competition, an industry giant changes how it does business to remain relevant and retain its dominance under a new set of economic rules.</p>
        <p>The crux of the changes is an effort to reorganize Harvard around the study of entrepreneurial ventures, be they dot-com start-ups or divisions of large companies trying to act like small companies. Those are the places that many Harvard students want to work today, and they are the businesses that occupy the thoughts of the nation's most sought-after academics. The shift has touched every Harvard student and has caused the business school -- the world's richest, best-known and most influential -- to start a series of initiatives in Silicon Valley, where Stanford, its most important rival, is pre-eminent.</p>
        <p>The M.B.A.'s who received their diplomas earlier this month here, across the Charles River from Harvard University's main campus in Cambridge, were the last who were required to take general management, once the school's signature course. Students now must enroll in a first-year class called ''The Entrepreneurial Manager.''</p>
        <p>Over the past school year, more than one-quarter of the electives chosen by second-year students were in the entrepreneurship department, which 20 years ago consisted of just two classes. Next year, 40 students will opt out of regular classes for two months to receive credit for working inside mostly small companies in Silicon Valley and Massachusetts. Already, officials have taken to boasting that Harvard sends more graduates to the valley than any other business school.</p>
        <p>''We need to change, indeed get out in front of the parade, to continue to attract these bright 25-year-olds,'' said Jay Light, a Harvard professor for 30 years and one of the school's senior associate deans overseeing the curriculum changes. ''If we don't maintain our relevance for what they want to do with their lives, there's a problem.''</p>
        <p>The shift brings some significant risks. In essence, Harvard has allowed its current students' interest in working for small companies -- an interest that cynics might brand a grasp for instant riches -- to play a major role in shaping its curriculum for the next decade. And while the Internet may be here to stay, the stock market's recent volatility suggests that entrepreneurial fervor may be more fleeting. The consolidation spree of the last decade also indicates that large companies -- indeed, ones larger than in the past -- will continue to dominate the economy.</p>
        <p>Yet Harvard, as it reinvents itself, could alienate the big-company recruiters who have faithfully trekked to Boston every autumn for decades. The school has made ''quite a radical set of changes,'' said Adrian J. Slywotzky, a vice president at Mercer Management Consulting near Boston who has often written about large organizations' attempts to reinvent themselves and who received his M.B.A. from Harvard in 1980. ''Large companies could say, 'I'm not sure how Harvard is serving me,' '' Mr. Slywotzky said.</p>
        <p>Harvard professors, however, say that the economic changes of the last five years have forced them to act and that, in any event, they are not really leaving behind the study of big companies. Almost like a mantra, the professors repeat word-for-word a definition of entrepreneurship that they say applies to General Electric as well as it does to a dot-com operated out of a garage: the pursuit of opportunities beyond means that are currently available.</p>
        <p>''We think of entrepreneurship not as a personality type or as a stage in the life cycle of a business but as a way of managing,'' said Kim B. Clark, the dean since 1995, whose overhaul of the business school has earned him mention as a candidate for Harvard University's presidency, now vacant. ''The concepts of leadership that are important now and are going to be important in the future spring out of an understanding of entrepreneurship.''</p>
        <p>Rosabeth M. Kanter, a professor of management, added, ''Big companies are dying to behave more like start-ups.''</p>
        <p>In the broadest sense, Harvard is simply catching up to its alumni. The school teaches students to think like general managers -- chief executives or presidents -- but not all of the 800-plus Harvard M.B.A. graduates each year can end up in such jobs at big companies. In fact, about one-third of graduates who have been out of Harvard for at least 15 years own their own businesses, according to studies done by the school.</p>
        <p>Now Harvard is arguing that it, more than any other institution and more than the hands-on experience of working at a start-up, can help today's students become entrepreneurs quickly. That argument is part realpolitik and part intellectual. The school gives students access to one of the economy's most powerful professional networks -- a Harvard keiretsu that includes all those earlier entrepreneurs, as well as dozens of venture capitalists and the founders of dozens of recent dot-coms.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the two years away from working life gives students time to think through a broad range of business problems, to take risks that they could not if actual dollars were at stake and, possibly, to even come up with their own business plans. ''We run a simulator where people are taking live shots at them,'' said William A. Sahlman, a longtime professor of entrepreneurship. ''This is the big time, but still low risk. You can't get that in the outside world.''</p>
        <p>Regardless of whether Harvard's transformation ultimately succeeds, it is already being felt far beyond Boston. Every year, Harvard's publishing house sells some six million copies of the school's famous case studies to other business schools and  organizations. So unlike, say, Berkeley's physics department or Yale's law school, Harvard Business School has a direct and immediate effect on the curriculum of hundreds of its peers.</p>
        <p>In other words, it just isn't at Harvard that business students are now learning about companies that most of them had never heard of.</p>
        <p>Playing Catch Up</p>
        <p>Prof. Paul Marshall was settling in to plan the last week of the semester  when one of his teaching assistants offered a blunt assessment of the situation. ''It's coming apart!'' he said. One of the final case studies for Harvard's new core class in entrepreneurship would contain sensitive information that eStyle -- the Internet retailer that was its subject -- was unwilling to release on Harvard's timetable.</p>
        <p>The professor would have none of it. ''Then pick up the pieces and run across the finish line,'' Mr. Marshall recalled telling the assistant. Sure enough, Harvard got eStyle to release the case in time for it to be printed, though students had to rush through reading it in two days, rather than the usual few weeks. Call it business school on Internet time.</p>
        <p>''The faculty is scrambling like hell'' to keep up with developments in the business world, Mr. Marshall said.</p>
        <p>Students say the class was uneven at times, but most agree that it was still much better than studying how Caterpillar might cut costs by a percentage point or how a Procter &amp; Gamble manager should market a new brand of tissues -- the sort of topics and companies on which Harvard's case studies had focused for decades.</p>
        <p>This is just one way that the school is a very different place than it was  five years ago, when Mr. Clark became dean. Netscape Communications had just gone public, and thousands of college students across the country were already addicted to e-mail. But Harvard Business School, one of the richest of any kind and one supposedly with a foot in the real world, had not given e-mail accounts to its students.</p>
        <p>''We were so far behind in 1995; we were, like, way, way behind,'' Mr. Clark said.</p>
        <p>He figured that the school could prosper by helping managers think about how to deal with the ways that technology was altering the corporate landscape -- or that it could fall  behind its peers quite rapidly. ''My sense was that we were at an inflection point, and we needed to seize the moment and take action,'' Mr. Clark said.</p>
        <p>Some of the changes were straightforward. By the first week of 1996, every student and professor had an e-mail account and could connect to it from all over campus. Harvard's case studies soon included spreadsheets tied to real-time data sets and videos.</p>
        <p>Altering the curriculum was more complicated, and more profound. Until the mid-1980's, the school offered only one or two entrepreneurship courses; many faculty members saw the subject as unworthy of rigorous study. ''It was pretty lonely,'' said Howard H. Stevenson, who has taught entrepreneurship at Harvard since the early 70's.</p>
        <p>As the technological shifts of the last 20 years took hold, however, the market changed all that. Students clamored for such classes, and the faculty's interest grew, too. The entrepreneurship department now offers some 18 courses taught by 28 professors, who range from lifetime academics to a co-founder of the Staples office supply chain.</p>
        <p>The most significant change is the switch of the required first-year class from general to entrepreneurial management. In 1990, the case subjects for the class included Bank One, Caterpillar, Colgate-Palmolive, General Electric, Honda, Nike and Pepsi-Cola. This year, the lineup included perhaps only two companies that a layman would recognize as major corporations -- Charles Schwab and Intuit. Among the others were Bitstream, Chemdex.com (now part of the Ventro Corporation), Go Fish and Onset Ventures.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marshall and his teaching assistants are not the only ones to find the transition bumpy. Last year, Mr. Clark felt it necessary to send a memo to professors forbidding them to serve on the boards of companies started by current students. And students have been pushing the career services office to do more to help them wade through the dozens of dot-coms that would eagerly hire a Harvard M.B.A.</p>
        <p>The more important question, however, may be what the changes will mean for corporate America. After all, generations of Harvard M.B.A.'s have filled the ranks of the country's consulting firms, investment banks and corporate giants. Now many of the most talented students are starting their own businesses or joining smaller companies.</p>
        <p>Harvard's decision to cater to that clientele, some people fear, could produce a group of budding executives with a much firmer understanding of how to raise venture capital than of how to steer a global enterprise. All the while, the world's corporations are becoming ever more complex as they swallow up rivals and stretch across international borders.</p>
        <p>''There is a risk to our generation all working in 10-  and 50-person companies,'' said Kevin M. Lalande, 28, a member of Harvard's class of 2001 who started two companies between his undergraduate work and business school. ''Later on, it's going to be much more difficult to find people who have the kind of experience to run a multinational.''</p>
        <p>Rivals? What Rivals?</p>
        <p>Harvard University is not given to paying much heed to its competition, and the business school generally fits the institutional mold. ''We don't think of ourselves as competing with other schools,'' said Mr. Light, a senior associate dean, when asked to name Harvard's closest rival. ''We think of ourselves as producing knowledge.''</p>
        <p>That is often a surprisingly insular process. Of the 28 professors in the entrepreneurship department, 13 hold a Harvard M.B.A.; an additional  7 have other Harvard University degrees. Ask them where they studied and some pause briefly before replying, ''Here.'' The answer is so obvious that the question seems almost to take them by surprise.</p>
        <p>But ''here'' is not exactly the center of the new economy; that would be 3,000 miles west of Boston, and Stanford Business School is in the midst of it.</p>
        <p>Stanford admits only one of every 13 applicants, making it almost twice as selective as Harvard by that measure. By reputation, Stanford has won a place alongside Harvard as one of the two best business schools in the country, most students agree, a notch above the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, the University of Chicago, Northwestern and Columbia. In the most recent ranking by U.S. News &amp; World Report, Harvard and Stanford tied for No. 1. ''We are each other's biggest competition, by far,'' said Robert Joss, Stanford's dean. ''In fact, our second-most-important competition is students who decide not to go to business school.''</p>
        <p>All of this presents a challenge to Harvard. It may have the advantage of better name recognition than Stanford, and more resources, but as the case studies often point out, such benefits do not guarantee success in the new economy. Indeed, if Harvard became the school of big business and the old economy while its cross-country rival was identified as a training ground for the new economy, it could look forward to the same kind of problems that business icons like General Motors have suffered in recent years.</p>
        <p>The analogy is not lost on Mr. Clark. A graduate of both Harvard College and Harvard's doctoral program in economics, he spent much of his academic career studying innovation at automobile companies, among others. It was Mr. Clark who, during yet one more long trip to the Bay Area a few years ago, conceived the notion that Harvard should establish a beachhead in northern California.</p>
        <p>After a typically frustrating search for Silicon Valley real estate -- agents offered sites like the third floor of a decrepit Victorian house and an office without a single parking place -- the California Research Center finally opened on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park in 1997. And if the name on the door and the address are impressive -- America's most prestigious university setting up shop on Silicon Valley's BMW-lined boulevard of venture capital and innovation -- the research center is not much to look at. It is a typically charmless suite of small second-floor offices that Harvard shares with a technology development firm.</p>
        <p>''We have visitors come in, especially from Asia, and say, 'This is it?' '' acknowledged Christina Darwall, the office's director and a former software entrepreneur. ''A lot of these people pull up in their big, long limousines. They're expecting marble.''</p>
        <p>There is no marble, but a steady parade of Harvard professors -- more than a third of the faculty, so far -- have tramped through the research center since it opened. Ms. Darwall and a small staff keep in closer touch with Silicon Valley companies than Harvard professors ever could from Boston, writing some case studies themselves and opening doors for the faculty to write others.</p>
        <p>''People are busier here, and it doesn't mean as much to them to be in a case,'' Ms. Darwall said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Harvard wants its paying customers to feel that studying at the business school can include time in Silicon Valley. So the center helped organize a job-hunting trip that sent more than 500 Harvard students to California during their winter vacation last year. Harvard has also begun conducting executive education programs in the valley, with about half of the students coming from the region.</p>
        <p>Of course, all this has raised a few eyebrows at Stanford, which has not exactly welcomed its Eastern counterpart with open arms. When Harvard officials were planning the research center, they approached Stanford about collaborating. Stanford never responded, Ms. Darwall said. Still, Mr. Joss, Stanford's dean, says he is not worried about Harvard's presence. ''We welcome the fact that they're interested in and engaged in the ideas out here,'' he said. ''We have the real benefit of being right in the heart of the action.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, many people in Silicon Valley consider Stanford the more forward-thinking of the two. ''They still think Harvard is an old school that teaches old tricks,'' said David Cowan, the managing general partner of Bessemer Venture Partners in Menlo Park, who received a Harvard M.B.A. in 1992. Yet based on his discussions with students and professors now at Harvard, Mr. Cowan believes the school has changed significantly.</p>
        <p>''When I went, I felt at the time I had made a mistake and should have gone to Stanford,'' he said. Now, he said, ''I sure wish I had gone to Harvard Business School more recently than when I did.''</p>
        <p>Harvard professors, true to their institutional instincts, tend to brush off the notion that they are increasingly competing with Stanford -- noting, for example, that they often collaborate with Stanford professors.</p>
        <p>But there may be a bit more rivalry than the professors acknowledge. One does not have to spend much time on the Boston campus to hear a few disparaging, if often light-hearted, comments about the Palo Alto campus. Mr. Sahlman, the entrepreneurship professor, even has a Stanford parking permit and a tattered Stanford pennant pinned up in his office.</p>
        <p>The permit reminds him of one downside of crowded Silicon Valley. The pennant was a gift from a class of students, Mr. Sahlman said, ''because I made fun of Stanford so much.''</p>
