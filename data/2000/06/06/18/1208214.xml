        <p>THE Caramoor International Music Festival in Katonah, N.Y., opens its eight-week season on Saturday with the cellist Yo-Yo Ma performing with the Orchestra of St. Luke's, conducted by the festival's artistic adviser, Peter Oundjian.</p>
        <p>''Giving concerts is what I love to do,'' said Mr. Ma in a telephone interview from his home in Cambridge, Mass. ''Summer concerts are fun, they're relaxed, you're not rushing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ma said he would be joined by the young cellist Edward Arron in Vivaldi's ''Concerto for Two Cellos.''</p>
        <p>''The 'Double' is just a fun piece of music,'' Mr. Ma said. ''Everybody knows the 'Four Seasons'.''</p>
        <p>''I get to play with my good friend and buddy Eddie,'' Mr. Ma said. ''He'd always wear these big red suspenders when he turned pages for Emanuel Ax and me. I've watched him grow up. When I left my cello in the cab, Eddie very generously had offered to lend me his.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ma will also take on Elgar's ''Cello Concerto in E Minor'' (Op. 85). ''The Elgar,'' Mr. Ma explained, ''is one of the great cello concertos that he wrote at the end of his life; countless people love this piece. It's very much about someone looking at life from the autumnal side with a lot of tenderness and wistfulness and passion.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ma also has a strong connection to those in the Orchestra of St. Lukes, Caramoor's resident orchestra. ''There are a lot of people that I grew up with, going to school, who are in the orchestra,'' he said. ''They care so deeply about what they do. Nobody ever gets into a rut, there's an enthusiasm, a core group feeling that's always there for the music.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Oundjian -- ''an old friend,'' Mr. Ma said -- turned to conducting full-time in 1995. While performing as first violinist of the Tokyo String Quartet, he had begun having decreasing flexibility in his left hand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oundjian, now in his third year as artistic advisor to the festival, also serves as music director of the Nieuw Sinfonietta Amsterdam, and as a guest conductor with major orchestras. Most recently he was in London, enroute to an engagement with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, and spoke by telephone about Caramoor's season. ''The more eclectic it is, the better,'' Mr. Oundjian said. ''Caramoor itself is the theme. We try to come up with an interesting program that challenges the audience to some degree and have a comfort level.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Oundjian will conduct three concerts during the season. For the closing program on Aug. 12, in addition to concertos by Bach and Mozart, he will offer his own transcription of Bartok's String Quartet No. 1 (Op. 10). ''It's an appropriate piece to orchestrate,'' he said. ''I feel -- and I hope I prove myself right -- that it's going to be very dramatic. It's so rich and demands a dimension of sound.''</p>
        <p>During the eight-week run of symphony, chamber music, contemporary music, opera and jazz concerts there will be guest artists including the pianists Misha Dichter, Alicia de Larrocha, Leon Fleisher, Vladimir Feltsman and Helene Grimaud.</p>
        <p>Others include the violinist Pamela Frank, the contemporary music group Eighth Blackbird, the jazz artists Chucho Valdes and James Moody, the cabaret artist Andrea Marcovicci as well as string quartets including the Avalon (in residence), Vermeer, Brentano and Shanghai.</p>
        <p>In addition to radio broadcasts on WQXR (96.3 FM) on Sundays at 6 p.m. from July 9 through Aug. 27, Caramoor offers live Webcasts of festival events. Global Music Network (www.gmn.com), a Web site for classical music, opera and jazz, will provide the video and audio Webcasts.</p>
        <p>The Caramoor International Music Festival (149 Girdle Ridge Road, Katonah, N.Y.) runs from Saturday through Aug. 12. The number to call for general information is (914) 232-5035. The box office can be reached at (914) 232-1252. Visit www.caramoor.com for further information.</p>
