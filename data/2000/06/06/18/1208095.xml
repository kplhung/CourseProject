        <p>FOR centuries the Swedes and the Danes were accustomed to communicating across the Oresund strait separating the two nations by sending their armies after each other and leaving behind gruesome calling cards of destruction and death.</p>
        <p>On July 1, they're sending their monarchs, Queen Margrethe of Denmark and King Carl Gustaf of Sweden, and what will be left standing as a reminder of their peaceable meeting is a steely new bridge shimmering in the Baltic mists that joins the two lands for the first time since they drifted apart 7,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>The Oresund Fixed Link, the new 9.5-mile, $2 billion tunnel and bridge connection being inaugurated that day, will tie southern Sweden to the continent of Europe and create a new European commercial center surpassing Stockholm and equal to cities like Berlin, Hamburg, Zurich and Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>When the four-lane highway and dual-track railroad open to traffic July 2, Copenhagen, Denmark's capital, will be only an 11-minute ride from Malmo, Sweden's third-largest city, and a single metropolitan region with a population of more than 3 million  will emerge. Tolls at the outset are about $28 a car, with discounts bringing the average cost down to $10 for travelers making more than 25 crossings.</p>
        <p>While Danes and Swedes have had their bloody differences in the past, they now share a passion for trade, business, tourism -- and promotion. The binational Oresund consortium markets the whole undertaking as ''Birth of a Region,'' backed by groups with names like ''Wonderful Copenhagen'' and ''Copenhagen Capacity'' and promoted with the slogan: ''Check this out! We're the Human Capital.''</p>
        <p>Europe is a continent with many borders, and while national frontiers continue to be the cause of conflict in places like the Balkans, regions that span two countries, like Copenhagen and Malmo or the southern English county of Kent and the northern French department of Pas-de-Calais, are presenting themselves to the world as one harmonious place. The European Union, of which both Sweden and Denmark are members, has broken down trade and currency barriers, but it has been slower to build transportation connections like the Oresund Link to make the Continent into a geographically accessible community.</p>
        <p>With the coming of the bridge, people from the area can drive to Berlin in the same six hours that it takes to get to Stockholm, a psychological boost to a population that tends to think of itself as living on the fringe of Europe.</p>
        <p>There is a heady mood among the citizens of Copenhagen and Malmo these days, and it is reassuring to know that residents of two such Internet-friendly countries can still place a premium on physical contact.</p>
        <p>For the Swedes of the southern province of Scania, being able to cross into Denmark so easily is something of a homecoming. Scania was annexed by Sweden 342 years ago, but some residents refer to the event as if it happened last Thursday. ''People who live in Scania think of themselves as more Danish than Swedish,'' said Fredrik Nilsson, a Swedish anthropologist from the University of Lund.</p>
        <p>For Swedes, the prized destination is Copenhagen, one of Europe's great cities. For Danes, a trip across the bridge takes them to a place with the gentle hills that their own flat and windswept land lacks and to a rich farming region with more than 240 grand manor houses and castles. Malmo is not as culturally vibrant as Stockholm or as commercially bustling as Sweden's second city, Goteborg, but it has one of Scandinavia's largest and liveliest city squares, Stortorget, canals and pedestrianized streets of  buildings from the 1860's in the style of the Dutch Renaissance. Nearby Lund boasts a 12th-century cathedral and one of Scandinavia's largest universities.</p>
        <p>The first plans for a bridge date back to 1888, and the present structure took seven years to build because of the steps necessary to meet the concerns of the two environmentally sensitive nations. The builders had to create an artificial peninsula and island to avoid interfering with Baltic water flows and bird and fish life. Even after construction began, polls on both sides of the water showed that people were still not convinced they really wanted to be any closer together than their troubled history had kept them.</p>
        <p>At the Danish entrance to the tunnel are two giant rock slabs, dug up during the excavation and weighing a total of 174 tons. They are the models for the logo of the project, symbols of the Viking-sized effort it took to construct the link. But they could also be seen as reminders of the attitudes of two populations that stubbornly resisted becoming one until now.</p>
