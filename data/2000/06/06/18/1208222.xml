        <p>FOR all his success at rising to the pinnacle of state government, George Elmer Pataki earned a reputation as a defiant outsider through much of his career as a lawmaker here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, who became the first Republican governor in a generation after defeating Mario M. Cuomo, served in the Legislature for 10 years, first in the Assembly for eight years and then in the Senate for two.</p>
        <p>In 1985, Mr. Pataki joined the Assembly, where members of the Republican minority have little power and are reduced to engaging in empty acts of defiance against the Democratic leaders. As a result, he accomplished little during his four terms.</p>
        <p>But he is remembered for finding ways of irritating the chamber's Democratic leadership, most notably his decision in 1990 to stage a highly unusual filibuster to draw attention to the Republicans' stand against higher taxes and spending increases.</p>
        <p>Not only was he an outsider in the Legislature, Mr. Pataki did not play a major role in the Westchester delegation.</p>
        <p>Richard L. Brodsky, a Democratic assemblyman from the county, said he thinks that Mr. Pataki simply didn't enjoy being a member of the Legislature.</p>
        <p>''George always had decent personal relationships with his colleagues,'' Mr. Brodsky said. ''The two of us played basketball together. But I don't think he ever much trusted or liked participating in the legislative process.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki did earn a good reputation among environmentalists, primarily because of his support for measures to protect water quality and open spaces.</p>
        <p>But as a member of the minority, he did not sponsor any major environmental legislation that passed in that chamber.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki left the Assembly in frustration in 1992, choosing to run for the State Senate.</p>
        <p>He defeated the Republican incumbent, Senator Mary B. Goodhue, in a bitter primary, which led leaders in his own party to harbor deep resentment toward him.</p>
        <p>As a member of the Republican majority in the Senate, Mr. Pataki is best known for defying the party's leadership to vote against the state budget in 1993 because it called for tax and spending increases.</p>
        <p>His stance on such matters laid the foundation for his 1994 campaign against Mr. Cuomo, permitting Mr. Pataki to cast himself as a fiscal conservative who could save the state from an economic tailspin resulting from years of reckless spending.</p>
        <p>But he was not exactly the ideological purist he made himself out to be.</p>
        <p>When he defied the Republican leaders in the Senate and voted against the state budget in 1993, he said he was doing so because it included the tax and spending increases he so loathed.</p>
        <p>But here's what he didn't say: a few weeks earlier, Mr. Pataki had persuaded the Senate leadership to include $500,000 in the budget to help finance pet projects in his district.</p>
        <p>The budget passed without Mr. Pataki's support, as was widely expected, and Mr. Pataki, for his part, pointed to the pork it contained as evidence of the good work he had done on behalf of his constituents.</p>
