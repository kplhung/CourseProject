        <p>IT is political pairing that turns heads even here in the State Capitol, a place that has forged plenty of strange alliances over the years: Senator Nicholas A. Spano and Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brodsky, a Democrat from Greenburgh, is a tireless self-promoter and partisan agitator, who, with his profane wit, does not mind embarrassing opponents to get his way. He has angered the Republican governor so often that his administration is reluctant to give Mr. Brodsky even basic information about state policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano, a Republican from Yonkers, is no less a presence here, but in a different way. He is a behind-the-scenes player who is known to court followers by lavishing favors on them without regard to their political agenda or status. Mr. Spano, who has been in the Legislature 22 years, is also a master deal maker, prompting a colleague to say that ''Nick's deals have deals.''</p>
        <p>But for all their personal and ideological differences, Mr. Spano and Mr. Brodsky have created a remarkably effective alliance, which is largely built on serving the interests of their most important client: Westchester County. It is a relationship that has earned them a catchy moniker: the Nick and Dick Show.</p>
        <p>It is a measure of how well they work together that Mr. Brodsky, one of the Assembly's most visible partisan warriors, has almost nothing bad to say about Mr. Spano -- and vice versa.</p>
        <p>''Nick and I do a lot of business together,'' said Mr. Brodsky, who has been in the Legislature for 17 years. ''Nick is an affable guy with a brain.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano had similar praise for Mr. Brodsky. ''He's bright, he's brash -- and sometimes he's overly sarcastic,'' Mr. Spano said. ''But he knows how to compromise and get the job done.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano and Mr. Brodsky are easily the most prominent members of Westchester's 11-member delegation, a rag-tag bunch made up of everything from urban liberals and suburban moderates to policy geeks and good-government reformers.</p>
        <p>''Our delegation is comprised of many people with diverse opinions,'' said Mr. Spano, who is an assistant majority leader in the Senate and one of the few senators positioning themselves to become majority leader. ''But we have never had a problem locking arms and working cohesively for the people of Westchester.''</p>
        <p>One reason for the delegation's cohesiveness is that for the last three decades members have held weekly caucuses.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday mornings, the seven Democrats and four Republicans meet in a conference room in the Legislative Office Building, just across the street from the State Capitol. It is an opportunity for banter and, more important, plotting strategy on many issues, most notably how to increase the county's share of state aid.</p>
        <p>To be sure, other delegations wield more influence. In the Senate, the nine Republicans from Long Island represent a large faction in the Republican majority, and little gets through that house without their approval. In the Assembly, the large delegation of Democrats from New York City has been in control for decades, electing speakers from within its own ranks.</p>
        <p>But Westchester has managed to be a quiet force despite its relatively small size and the competing interests of its members.</p>
        <p>Perhaps one of the county's greatest advantages is that its legislative districts do not, in general, offer a huge voter-enrollment edge to Democrats or Republicans. As a result, leaders of both parties direct millions of dollars in pork-barrel projects and other largesse to these highly competitive districts. That way, incumbents can boast of having delivered for constituents.</p>
        <p>The delegation has not distinguished itself as a champion of any one cause, though individual members have carved out niches in certain areas, like Mr. Brodsky's prominence on environmental matters and Mr. Spano's role in expanding services for people with mental and physical disabilities.</p>
        <p>Most of all, the delegation has focused on parochial matters, like its recent successful efforts to get about $1 million to prevent fare increases on the county bus system as well as millions more to preserve open space at Gaisman Park in Greenburgh, to implement a pesticide program to prevent another outbreak of West Nile virus and to stock the county's soup kitchens, food pantries and homeless shelters.</p>
        <p>The delegation is no longer the Republican-run, all-white group it was a generation ago, reflecting the county's changing demographics. There is one Republican in the Assembly delegation and three in the Senate. It includes two blacks and four women.</p>
        <p>The delegation holds several key positions in both houses, enhancing its ability to control the flow of legislation. It has two chairmanships in the Assembly: one on the Environmental Conservation Committee and another on the Libraries and Education Technologies Committee. It recently lost its chairmanship on the Veterans Affairs Committee after Ronald C. Tocci, a Democrat from New Rochelle, was demoted for taking part in a failed attempt to oust the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver.</p>
        <p>Delegation members also have two powerful chairmanships in the Senate: one on the Labor Committee and the other on the Civil Service and Pension Committee. More than that, two members -- Mr. Spano and Guy J. Velella, a Republican -- hold leadership posts and are part of the Senate majority leader's inner circle.</p>
        <p>In addition, Westchester has a powerful ally in Gov. George E. Pataki, who represented the county in the Legislature for almost 10 years, as senator and assemblyman. Many of Mr. Pataki's closest advisers have been prominent Westchester residents, and there was talk, for a time, that he would pick Jeanine Pirro, the county's district attorney, as his running mate in 1998.</p>
        <p>Deep divisions do flare up within the delegation from time to time, the most recent resulting from the power struggle among Assembly Democrats over their leader, Mr. Silver. A handful of Westchester lawmakers joined the effort to oust Mr. Silver, who is widely seen as an aloof leader. Mr. Silver and his supporters beat back the coup attempt, but bitter feelings remain. ''We have been divided before, but never on this magnitude,'' said Sandra R. Galef, a Democrat from Ossining who joined in the coup attempt. She offers no apologies for her defiance, saying the speaker does not tolerate dissent or permit open debate on major policy issues.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Silver's supporters say the plotters were undermining a leader who has advanced a Democratic agenda in the face of a hostile Republican administration. Mr. Brodsky, who led the floor fight to defend the speaker, said: ''I think the way it was done bordered on self-mutilation. It obscured the fact that Shelly Silver and the Democratic majority have been a defining force on the substance of what matters to people in Westchester.''</p>
        <p>One of those involved in the coup attempt was Assemblywoman Naomi C. Matusow, who has benefited significantly from representing a swing district, the 89th, which includes Bedford, Harrison, Mount Kisco, New Castle, North Castle, North Salem, Pound Ridge, Somers and part of White Plains. Republicans have a small advantage over Democrats in enrollment, but there are many independent voters.</p>
        <p>Every two years, since Ms. Matusow unexpectedly defeated a Republican incumbent in 1992, Republican party leaders have tried to reclaim her seat.</p>
        <p>Ms. Matusow, who lives in Bedford, likes to point to her legislative record as a measure of her influence in Albany. It is a record that includes sponsorship of a bill to ban assault weapons, as well as generous school aid and other money for her district.</p>
        <p>But the truth is that much of her success would not have been possible without the support she has consistently received from Mr. Silver. His desire to hold onto to Ms. Matusow's seat has led him to put her needs at the top of his list of legislative and political priorities. In 1998, the Assembly campaign committee that Mr. Silver controls spent nearly $245,000 helping re-elect Ms. Matusow.</p>
        <p>Despite such support, Ms. Matusow, expressing unhappiness with the autocratic way the speaker runs the house, joined the effort to oust him. Those close to Mr. Silver saw her decision as an act of betrayal.</p>
        <p>Ms. Matusow and Mr. Silver have tried to mend fences since the coup attempt against the speaker failed. They both have good reason to do so. Ms. Matusow, obviously, needs Mr. Silver, given what he can do for her, and Mr. Silver needs broad support to win another term as speaker in December.</p>
        <p>The Westchester delegation has other iconoclasts in its ranks. The most outspoken by far is Ms. Galef, a Democrat who represents the 90th Assembly District in northern Westchester, which includes Peekskill, Cortlandt, Yorktown, Croton-on-Hudson, Ossining and Briarcliff Manor. Democrats have a slight enrollment advantage over Republicans in the district.</p>
        <p>Ms. Galef has built a reputation as a government reformer, decrying the Legislature's notorious practice of giving the Senate majority leader and the Assembly Speaker control over nearly every legislative matter. Her biggest claim to fame is a bill that would abolish the Capitol's much-maligned tradition of allowing the two leaders to hammer out the state budget in secret negotiations with the governor.</p>
        <p>Her bill would transfer power over budget negotiations from legislative leaders to a committee made up of rank-and-file lawmakers and aides to the governor. Ms. Galef's proposal has broad support in both houses. But it has yet to pass the Assembly because the speaker has blocked it from coming to the floor for a vote.</p>
        <p>Ms. Galef has shown little interest in legislation that focuses on anything other than government reform, and she gets very few bills passed each year, even though she has seniority in the Assembly and is a member of the majority party in that house. When the Westchester delegation gets together to strategize over how to bring home more pork to the county, Ms. Galef refuses to have any part of it.</p>
        <p>Ms. Galef also has an up-and-down relationship with Mr. Silver, which explains why so few of her bills are passed. But Ms. Galef, who is fairly conservative, has developed a warm and friendly association with Mr. Pataki, who was once the mayor of Peekskill, which is in her district.</p>
        <p>The delegation also has members who, like many of their colleagues in the Legislature, keep a low profile.</p>
        <p>There is Audrey G. Hochberg, a Democrat from the 88th Assembly district in Scarsdale, who is stepping down this year. Ms. Hochberg is well liked, smart and hard-working. But she was not all that adept at political maneuvering. She heads the Solid Waste Committee and knows her subject well: she sponsors a lot of bills involving things like carting and recycling. Ms. Hochberg was an outspoken advocate for a new state program to expand prekindergarten and day care slots statewide.</p>
        <p>There is Mr. Velella, a Republican from the 34th Senatorial District, which straddles Westchester and the Bronx. He is a consummate political operator who avoids the limelight. He is the most important pipeline for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to the Senate's Republican leadership. He gets a lot of bills passed, particularly those that assisted the insurance industry when he was chairman of the Insurance Committee. He is personally conservative but tempers it to be in step with the moderate politics of his district and the Republican conference in the Senate.</p>
        <p>Another member is James Gary Pretlow, a Democrat from the 84th Assembly District in Mount Vernon. Mr. Pretlow is a low-key legislator, likable, though not strongly identified with any particular issue. He comes from a largely minority district, and he is a member of the influential black and Hispanic caucus, though not one of its most prominent members.</p>
        <p>The others are Michael J. Spano, a Republican from the 87th Assembly District in Yonkers who is Senator Spano's younger brother; Mr. Tocci, a Democrat from the 85th Assembly District in New Rochelle who is among the more conservative members of his party; Vincent L. Leibell, a Republican from the 37th Senatorial District in Brewster, who inherited Mr. Pataki's old seat; and Suzi Oppenheimer, a Democrat from the 36th Senatorial District in Port Chester, who is well-liked, but not very influential.</p>
        <p>When it comes to delivering big items for the county, the job usually falls to Mr. Brodsky and Mr. Spano, the delegation's co-chairmen. The reason is that the two of them not only have seniority in the Legislature but also have close ties to the leaders of their respective houses. More than that, they have assembled aggressive staffs and immerse themselves in the details of the legislative process.</p>
        <p>The two have worked closely to persuade their leaders to give Westchester generous amounts of school aid, a calculation that is usually based as much on political considerations as on educational needs.</p>
        <p>They also beat back proposals to cut Westchester's share of money for a program intended to reduce property taxes, which was enacted in 1996.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brodsky and Mr. Spano also wrote legislation that privatized the county-owned Westchester County Medical Center, allowing it to compete in the open market unencumbered by government red tape.</p>
        <p>The two also work together touting their victories on behalf of the county. Mr. Brodsky and Mr. Spano routinely make public appearances together, something that is exceedingly rare in the highly partisan culture of Albany. They are also regular guests on a talk show called ''Newsmakers,'' which is broadcast on the Westchester County News Network each week.</p>
        <p>But the two have their obvious differences. Mr. Brodsky is not shy about supporting the Democratic candidates who challenge Mr. Spano -- and Mr. Spano takes similar stands against Mr. Brodsky. The two even have strikingly different demeanors -- with Mr. Brodsky being short, wiry and loud and Mr. Spano having a burly and soft-spoken presence. As one high-ranking official in the Legislature summed it up: ''It's a strange combination. But it works for them.''</p>
