        <p>THE Roland MC-505 Groovebox, a small programmable synthesizer, is an impressive musical plaything. It has been called a ''band in a box''; it is also a nostalgia machine, capable of producing a wild variety of vintage keyboard sounds, as well as the trademark thuds and thumps of some of the most popular rhythm machines of all time, including Roland's 303 bass synthesizer and its 808 and 909 beat boxes.</p>
        <p>While those instruments have been out of production since the early 1980's and are primitive by today's standards, they remain the objects of a fervid cult among dance music cognoscenti: lavished with love in tribute songs like Fatboy Slim's ''Everybody Needs a 303,'' celebrated on countless Web sites, praised in rap lyrics (''Nothing sounds quite like an 808,'' exclaimed the Beastie Boys in 1998's ''Super Disco Breakin' ''), paid the ultimate tribute by eponymous acts like 808 State and House of 909. For the purists who for years have circulated petitions entreating the Roland company to rerelease its defunct 80's synthesizers, the Groove box is a dream toy: collapsing a library of cherished sounds into one gizmo, it allows musicians to summon the retro-cool of old school hip-hop, early house, 80's synth-pop and other old styles at the touch of a button.</p>

        <p>THE Roland MC-505 Groovebox, a small programmable synthesizer, is an impressive musical plaything. It has been called a ''band in a box''; it is also a nostalgia machine, capable of producing a wild variety of vintage keyboard sounds, as well as the trademark thuds and thumps of some of the most popular rhythm machines of all time, including Roland's 303 bass synthesizer and its 808 and 909 beat boxes.</p>
        <p>While those instruments have been out of production since the early 1980's and are primitive by today's standards, they remain the objects of a fervid cult among dance music cognoscenti: lavished with love in tribute songs like Fatboy Slim's ''Everybody Needs a 303,'' celebrated on countless Web sites, praised in rap lyrics (''Nothing sounds quite like an 808,'' exclaimed the Beastie Boys in 1998's ''Super Disco Breakin' ''), paid the ultimate tribute by eponymous acts like 808 State and House of 909. For the purists who for years have circulated petitions entreating the Roland company to rerelease its defunct 80's synthesizers, the Groove box is a dream toy: collapsing a library of cherished sounds into one gizmo, it allows musicians to summon the retro-cool of old school hip-hop, early house, 80's synth-pop and other old styles at the touch of a button.</p>
        <p>''At Home With the Groovebox,'' a recently released compilation on Grand Royal (GR068), the quirky label founded by the Beastie Boys, collects the results of 14 close encounters between musicians and Roland's new-old instrument. As its title suggests, the album is an anthology of irreverent home recordings: Grand Royal gave Grooveboxes to artists ranging from the avant-rock veterans Sonic Youth to the pop eclectic Beck to the synthesizer innovators Jean Jacques Perrey and Dick Hyman and asked them to create songs using only the machine and, if necessary, the human voice. The resulting music -- full of frosty keyboard arpeggios, stiff computerized beats and pinging sci-fi sound effects -- reflects the allure of 80's-style sonic artifice: though the Groovebox also features hundreds of up-to-date sounds and rhythm patterns, few of the participants in this experiment were able to resist the temptation to dial up the past.</p>
        <p>A number of 80's dance and pop genres are revisited on ''At Home With the Groovebox'' in songs that teeter between straight-faced homage and affectionate lampoon. The Japanese band Buffalo Daughter's ''303 + 606 = Acid'' is a fond but dull tribute to the exuberantly wriggling acid house bass lines that propelled a thousand late-80's raves. Beck and the indie-rock heroes Pavement offer impish takes on old-school hip-hop; Beck's ''Boyz'' is the record's most unabashed pastiche: a vocoder-laced trip back to the future envisaged by electro classics like Afrika Bambaataa's ''Planet Rock'' and Herbie Hancock's ''Rockit.''</p>
        <p>Others use the Groovebox to revive more mainstream sounds. The Moog synthesizer ace Gershon Kingsley's new version of his instrumental hit ''Popcorn'' turns the song into a blithe, blandly funky piece of synth-pop in the style of 80's hitmakers like Tears for Fears and Howard Jones. Air's melodramatic ''Planet Vega'' could have been the backing track for a mid-80's ballad by Madonna or Duran Duran; Sean Lennon's ''Winged Elephants'' pairs a clatter of drumbeats with a rumbling Jupiter synthesizer bass line cribbed from ''Thriller''-era Michael Jackson.</p>
        <p>The 80's revivalism so evident on ''At Home With the Groovebox'' reflects a broader trend that in recent years has seen rap and dance artists resurrecting old styles from the spare beats and robotic blips of electro-funk to the elegant austerity of early Chicago house.</p>
        <p>This vogue for the music of yesteryear is something new in hip-hop and electronica cultures, which place such a premium on fresh sounds: a sign of developing historical self-consciousness. Rap and techno have reached maturity, and canon-making is in full swing: bookshelves are filling up with plump histories of the genres; boxed-set retrospectives are being released; there are even hip-hop reunion tours, in which gray-haired MC's rap their golden oldies. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame recently mounted an exhibition on the history of hip-hop; we are only a few years away from the day when Grandmaster Flash and Run-DMC will take their place alongside Chuck Berry and the Beatles among Hall of Fame inductees.</p>
        <p>When hip-hop and dance music fans and artists explore the genres' 1980's back catalogs, they discover music that, in contrast to today's records -- products of the now highly evolved art of sampling -- seems almost folksy: charmingly naive artifacts of a more innocent technological age. But the songs that strike us today as quaint were, in their time, cutting-edge pop, the outcome of a collision of new equipment and old-fashioned creativity.</p>
        <p>Though 80's pop musicians of all stripes realized that synthesizers and sampling technology represented the future, hip-hop and house music-makers were by far the best at reckoning with the new gadgets. They succeeded by approaching the machines with imagination and a disdain for owner's manual guidelines: rap producers detuned the Roland 808 drum machine and created the sustained low-frequency boom that became one of hip-hop's great sonic hallmarks; acid house was born when D.J.'s discovered that by twiddling the knobs on the 303 bass machine they could squelch and distend bass lines to psychedelic effect.</p>
        <p>Such ingenuity transformed rinky-dink technology -- contraptions designed primarily to accompany guitarists jamming in their bedrooms -- into the roaring engines of a dance music revolution.</p>
        <p>NOT surprisingly, the best tracks on ''At Home With the Groovebox'' are made by performers who approach the machine with that same rogue spirit. Sonic Youth's ''Campfire'' is an electronic pastorale: over a single held high note, the band piles percussive pops, squeaks and swishes, evoking chirping crickets and a humming, crackling campfire throwing sparks toward a starlit sky. Bonnie (Prince) Billie -- one of the singer-songwriter Will Oldham's many pseudonyms -- also makes his Groovebox say more by saying less: it provides gently murmuring accompaniment to ''Today I Started Celebrating Again,'' a lovely gospel-flavored ballad.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Jean Jacques Perrey's success is one of festive overindulgence. His track, ''The Groovy Leprechauns,'' rings a dizzying series of changes over a funky eight-bar bass figure, making use of seemingly every possible Groovebox sound effect -- clanging chimes, video game pongs, snake-charmer Orientalisms, Donald Duck quacking noises -- and ending with a gloriously tasteless exclamation point: a brusque computerized belch.</p>
        <p>These highlights are a tantalizing hint of the Groovebox anthology that might have been, with a more inspired lineup. Most of the acts on ''At Home with the Groovebox'' are drawn from the Grand Royal label's roster or are members of its extended family of hipster nerds. They are record collector types, content to use the Groovebox to recreate the sound of their favorite well-worn 12-inch singles.</p>
        <p>A more fruitful sequel might put the Groovebox in the hands of today's wizards of drum programming and sound collage: top hip-hop and electronica producers like Timbaland, Dr. Dre, the RZA, Fatboy Slim, Autechre and Bassment Jaxx. Even better: why not let the 80's trailblazers themselves -- Afrika Bambaataa, Grandmaster Flash, the acid house pioneer DJ Pierre, the Detroit techno legend Derrick May -- take a crack at the Groovebox? Those musicians, whose innovations have been broken into bytes and burned into the Groovebox's memory, might be better equipped than anyone to wrestle with this robot -- to teach a computer in love with the past how to get down in the present.</p>
