        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas crisscrossed Florida today with his brother -- the other Governor Bush -- at his side, and criticized the recent security lapses at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, saying ''America's nuclear security should not be a matter of lost and found.''</p>
        <p>Campaigning at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Florida state convention in Kissimmee, Governor Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, promised, ''In my administration our national labs will be secure again, our vital information will be sealed again, our nuclear secrets will be safe again.''</p>
        <p>Federal officials are investigating the disappearance and reappearance at the laboratory of two computer hard drives containing nuclear secrets. The hard drives were found on Friday behind a copying machine in a secure area after being reported missing on May 31.</p>
        <p>Most of the day was more light-hearted, with the Texas governor even teasing reporters with the possibility of a Bush-Bush ticket. As he fended off the daily deluge of questions on his campaign plane about his vice-presidential search, Mr. Bush turned to his younger brother Jeb, who was standing at his side.</p>
        <p>''What do you think?'' the governor of Texas asked the governor of Florida.</p>
        <p>''I'll stick to my day job,'' Jeb hastily replied.</p>
        <p>But the older brother relished the idea a moment longer. ''It would save space on bumper stickers,'' he said, imagining just one word: Bush.</p>
        <p>If not a ticket, the Bush brothers were still a hit with the veterans, who gave them a string of standing, cheering ovations.</p>
        <p>''I particularly want to say something about the governor of Florida -- my big little brother,'' said George Bush, 53, referring to Jeb, 47, who stands half a head taller than him. ''We're all proud of him, and we know you are as well.''</p>
        <p>''He came with a positive agenda,'' the Texan said. ''He's serving for the right reason, and both of us have been successful because we listened to our mother.''</p>
        <p>With his brother serving as governor, Mr. Bush should have a powerful advantage campaigning for Florida's 25 electoral votes.</p>
        <p>But Vice President Al Gore has also mounted an all-out drive for the state. He even broke with the Clinton administration by supporting legislation to grant permanent resident status to Elian Gonzalez, a move that brought protests from many loyal Gore backers, who called it a craven bid to win Cuban-American votes.</p>
        <p>The last public poll, in May, showed Mr. Bush ahead but Mr. Gore gaining ground. President Clinton won Florida four years ago after narrowly losing it to President Bush in 1992. Asked how his brother was doing, Jeb Bush told reporters on the campaign plane, ''He's winning.''</p>
        <p>But the Florida governor conceded that if Mr. Gore were to select Senator Bob Graham of Florida as his running mate, ''it would tighten the race up.''</p>
        <p>Asked if Mr. Gore could win Florida, Jeb Bush said: ''Everything's possible. I'm pretty optimistic, though. As long as we get a few resources from the national campaign we'll do fine.''</p>
        <p>Much of the day, in fact, was devoted to raising money for the campaign. George Bush brought in an estimated $2.75 million for the Republican National Committee and the state party at a midday reception in Coral Gables and at a fund-raising dinner later here in Orlando.</p>
        <p>The Texas governor also won the endorsement of the Florida chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the nation's oldest and largest Hispanic organization.</p>
        <p>Members of the Bush family have said, until he lost his first bid to be governor of Florida, they had expected that Jeb Bush would be the brother to run for president. But he said today that he did not have any ambitions to seek the presidency himself. ''I'm consumed by my work an my family,'' he said, ''and I've got the best job in the world.''</p>
        <p>The two brothers were dressed nearly identically in blue shirts and red ties.</p>
        <p>''Interesting that you brought that up,'' George Bush said, when asked whether the choice of dress was intentional. ''You can see mine's a little kind of softer tone. It's a little more presidential look.''</p>
