        <p>Article on new, fourth edition of Norval White's and Elliot Willensky's AIA Guide to New York City, first published in 1967; 1,056-page book, first in 12 years, covers each borough almost block by block, building by building; photos (L)</p>

        <p>IN Borges's story ''The Aleph,'' the narrator opens the trapdoor of a cellar to find himself staring at ''millions of acts both delightful and awful,'' all of which simultaneously ''occupied the same point in space.'' So a newcomer might feel, arriving in New York City for the first time.</p>
        <p>How does one begin to ''read'' New York, to make sense of that limitless, cabalistic text? The best single gloss I know of is the AIA Guide to New York City, by Norval White and Elliot Willensky, about to appear in a new edition, the first in 12 years. Covering each borough almost block by block, building by building, it is an extraordinarily learned, personable exegesis of our metropolis. No other American or, for that matter, world city can boast so definitive a one-volume guide to its built environment.</p>
        <p>The first edition appeared in 1967. A svelte 400-plus pages, written by two young architectural enthusiasts who paid for its first printing, it was given free to the members at the American Institute of Architects convention in honor of that group's 100th anniversary.</p>
        <p>Changes in the city fabric necessitated expanded editions in 1978 and 1988. Now, after nearly 33 years in print and 185,000 copies sold, the fourth edition tips the scales at 1,056 pages. You can still walk around with the AIA Guide in hand, but strong wrists are required. I confess I have taken to ripping pages out before exploring a new neighborhood, then guiltily reinserting them at home. Heaven, for me, would be a loose-leaf edition.</p>
        <p>Though I've never met either Norval White or Elliot Willensky, their pithy, opinionated viewpoints have become as familiar to me as Gilbert and Sullivan's.</p>
        <p>Gateway Plaza's towers are ''the scullery maids of Battery Park City''; the Upper West Side's Calhoun School suggests that a ''modern-day Gulliver must have been here and left behind his giant-sized TV.'' Since the entries are unsigned, one can only speculate who contributed what. Mr. Willensky died in 1990, at a youthful 56. I imagine him the more unbuttoned of the pair, partly based on a reading of his warm, schmaltzy book, ''When Brooklyn Was the World'' (1986). Mr. White seems more formal and circumspect, given certain word changes in this fourth edition. For instance, the breezy ''Get a load of those rusticated marshmallow columns'' has been trimmed to ''Savor those rusticated. . . .'' For the most part, thankfully, the guide has not been rewritten, merely added to, with hundreds of new entries, 2,000 new photographs and 80 new maps. Mr. White has also reinspected on foot almost all of the 5,000 buildings, to ensure that the information is still accurate.</p>
        <p>The Necrology section on perished New York treasures, which was ghoulishly fascinating, has been dropped, regrettably, for space reasons, but the AIA Guide remains saturated with ghosts and demolitions. We learn what once was on this site and is no more, what utopian proposals came to naught.</p>
        <p>In a city famous for historical amnesia, destroying and remaking wherever there was profit to be made thereby, this volume is an Ancient Mariner recounting Gotham's actual transformations.</p>
        <p>Take an entry, at random, about one Clason Point in the Bronx:</p>
        <p>''A protuberance into either Long Island Sound or the East River, depending on your geographical alliances. It has, over the years, been labeled after its successive occupants: Snakipins (the native American settlement), Cornell Point (after Thomas Cornell, 1642), and finally Clason Point (after Isaac Clason). Between 1883 and 1927 it was the home of Clason Military Academy, operated by a Roman Catholic order. Before the trolley came, in 1910, public access was via boat, launch or steamer from Long Island, Mott Haven, and Manhattan. The waters were not polluted then. The attractions were dance halls and hotels, picnic grounds and a bathing pier, restaurants, a salt water pool, and places with names like Dietrich's, Gilligan's Pavilion and Killian's Grove, Higg's Camp Grounds and Kane's Casino. (Kane's Casino held out until it caught fire in 1942.)</p>
        <p>''Between 1923 and 1938 the city operated a popular ferry service to College Point, in Queens. Tragedy came in 1924 when a freak wind squall blew down the Clason Point Amusement Park's Ferris wheel (on the site of Shorehaven Beach Club, now endangered), killing 24. Prohibition, pollution and competition (from filtered pools like easily accessible Starlight Park in nearby West Farms) finally doomed the resort area.''</p>
        <p>An entire resort about which I knew nothing, and now I cannot get that freak wind squall out of my mind. But fine as it is to learn about some obscure metropolitan corner, it's just as irresistible to look up familiar places, and see what judgments W &amp; W will render. Kane Street Synagogue? ''Originally a brick and brownstone Romanesque Revival, its present stuccoed exterior is bland but waterproof.'' Fair enough. The World Trade Center? ''When completed, these stolid, banal monoliths came to overshadow Lower Manhattan's cluster of filigreed towers that symbolized the very concept of 'skyline.' ''</p>
        <p>I guess they're right, even if I've grown perversely attached to the Twin Towers over the years.</p>
        <p>What needs to be grasped is that the AIA Guide to New York City is not only usefully descriptive but influentially, if controversially, prescriptive.</p>
        <p>Indeed, I would place it on that short shelf of postwar urban classics, like Jane Jacobs's ''Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' Robert A. Caro's ''Power Broker'' and William H. Whyte's ''City,'' that have profoundly altered the way we looked at cities, and taught us to appreciate their messy, ad hoc, additive nature. Where garden-city planners had seen chaos in mixed usage, these authors saw diversity and neighborhood vitality; what architectural purists regarded as a retrograde and degraded melange of styles, these authors defended as rich historical layering. A single block might have eight consecutive buildings of differing height and period styles and still feel unified to the viewer's glance -- provided, say, all the buildings lined up at a continuous street wall.</p>
        <p>By drawing attention to what likably blends in or antisocially sticks out, the AIA Guide has applied a communal, city-making standard to the often narcissistic art of modern architecture. Beyond that, it has taught us to appreciate the amazing one-thing-after-anotherness of New York, which is its true, distinguishing aesthetic.</p>
        <p>The guide reflects the sea change that began in the 1960's, part of which involved a revaluation of the city's heritage. Not surprisingly, Mr. White and Mr. Willensky were among those young architects picketing the demolition of McKim, Mead &amp; White's magnificent Pennsylvania Station in 1962, as they proudly tell us in the guide. The razing of Penn Station led to the passage of the Landmarks Preservation Act, and to a widespread consensus about the principles or premises supporting urbanism.</p>
        <p>Among these principles, which found articulate enunciation in the AIA Guide, were: that whatever architecture from previous periods was still attractive and functioning should be protected and preserved; that one could learn from this past (the way Battery Park City's promenade unashamedly speaks the same design vocabulary as the Brooklyn Heights promenade); that mixed use and density might not be such bad things after all, whereas voids introduced into the urban fabric, like unused corporate plazas, tend to be boring; that the integrity of the street wall should be maintained wherever possible; that the public realm (streets, parks, transportation) should resist privatization; and that new buildings should fit into their immediate surroundings, the principle of Contextualism.</p>
        <p>Certainly, Contextualism can become, as this paper's architectural critic, Herbert Muschamp, has pointed out, a rigid ideology supporting a failure of artistic nerve and imagination. When he criticizes the Giuliani administration's new zoning proposals as a conservative effort that would seek to freeze the city's skyline in an ''Art Deco contour,'' and, he argues, freeze out edgy new architecture that might challenge the street wall, he is partly assailing the sensibility enshrined in the AIA Guide.</p>
        <p>Frustration with the scarcity of daring contemporary architecture in New York is certainly understandable. On the other hand, New York has never been an architectural mecca, if what we mean by that term is genius-designed, innovative buildings that stand forth as art objects. Chicago has more great textbook architecture than New York, but New York has a thicker, more continuous, livelier urban fabric. New York excels in the creation of places, urban spaces that achieve a sense of identity. For instance, Times Square, known the world over, was never much architecturally, nor is it now, but it's had the knack of concentrating energy, desire, imagination in a single site.</p>
        <p>Another New York specialty is its production of decent background buildings that perform like good role players in the urban weave. Such reliable New York types as the brownstone row house, the six-story barbell walkup, the 12- to 15-story apartment buildings like those found along West End Avenue or Sutton Place, even the tenement, don't require brilliant architects to make their successful contribution to the mix.</p>
        <p>Certainly, New York can boast of some architectural masterpieces, all duly noted in the AIA Guide, by masters like Stanford White, Cass Gilbert, Louis Sullivan, Mies van der Rohe, Frank Lloyd Wright, Gordon Bunshaft and Eero Saarinen. But what gives the city its pizzazz is that lively, eclectic synchronicity that makes the whole so much greater than its parts. Hence, the AIA Guide's love of Rockefeller Center, which many snootier architectural critics have criticized as mundane. To Mr. White and Mr. Willensky it is ''an island of architectural excellence,'' ''the greatest urban complex of the 20th century: an understated and urbane place that has become a classic lesson in the point and counterpoint of space, form and circulation.''</p>
        <p>Conversely, the guide seems a bit too skeptical about some of the newer efforts to perpetuate innovative, surprising architecture. The LMVH Building by Christian de Portzamparc (which I happen to love) is summarized as: ''Folded planes create a sleek but aggressive glass curtain wall punctuating dour 57th Street. Its high style may soon be last year's. French Champagne does those things.'' Then again, you don't go to the AIA Guide for its hip enthusiasms, but for the avuncular back story on some richly detailed facade you've found on a walk.</p>
        <p>New York is jam-packed with these visual grace notes: chromatic terra cotta inlays, ornate second-story grilles, fanciful water towers, staid buildings that end in grandiloquent Mayan or Babylonian crowns, cast-iron fronts with elegant patterns. This city's streets are aburst with fragments of greatness (or oddness: it almost comes to the same thing), and the AIA Guide, dedicated as it is to an aesthetic of modest delights more than knockout masterpieces, does a wonderful job of pointing them out.</p>
        <p>Mr. White and Mr. Willensky are especially helpful in unraveling the story of New York's unsung heroes who contributed mightily to the city's texture. So we learn of Clarence F. True, an architect and developer who bought up property along lower Riverside Drive and built ''idiosyncratic'' mansions, many of which still exist, in an ''Elizabethan Renaissance'' style; Alfred T. White, a pragmatically idealistic businessman whose philosophy, ''philanthropy plus 5 percent,'' led him to put up well-constructed, low-rent housing in Brooklyn and Queens; Herbert Johnson, ''a sainted parkie'' under Robert Moses ''whose vision and incredibly hard work transformed the dunes and marshes into an invaluable public accommodation'' at Jamaica Bay.</p>
        <p>We also encounter Frank Freeman, ''Brooklyn's greatest architect,'' whose 1892 City of Brooklyn Fire Headquarters on Jay Street is ''a building to write home about''; the Three Musketeers of the 1920's and 30's, Ralph Walker, Raymond Hood and Ely Jacques Kahn, whose stepback skyscrapers helped define that entertainingly moderne style Rem Koolhass has labeled ''Manhattanism''; and the Chanin brothers, two developers from Brooklyn who taught themselves architecture and insisted on the best Art Deco craftsmanship in their Central Park West and 42nd Street buildings (''Look back on such distinguished self-improvement, Mr. Trump.'').</p>
        <p>Since the guide's focus is relentlessly New York, it makes no amends for its local-insider tone, as in this critique of Riverside South's high-rises: ''A heavy hand here from the virtuoso,'' Philip Johnson, ''but after what happened at the Trump International Hotel, what could you hope for in a Philip and Donald act?''</p>
        <p>There are many thoughtful, measured assessments of the work by architectural firms that have been rebuilding or restoring New York in the last few decades, like James Stewart Polshek, Davis-Brody, Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer, Ehrenkrantz-Eckstut, Giovanni Pasanella, Gruzen Samton, Richard Dattner, Cesar Pelli. What's surprising, though, for a volume ostensibly dedicated to architecture, is how much of the guide's information is not professionally oriented, but gathers in the lore, traditions, casual institutions and events that collectively define New York's spirit. Here you will find asides on Edgar Allen Poe's pre-tavern strolls and the Gotham Book Mart's strengths, Citarella's fresh seafood, the 1920 anarchist bombing of J. P. Morgan's headquarters and poor Kitty Genovese's unanswered screams.</p>
        <p>When push comes to shove, the AIA Guide sees that what matters about buildings is not solely their window treatment or spandrels, but the life lived in and through them. The best city architecture is that which makes possible the world of the street.</p>
        <p>Beloved Buldings, Old and Newish, Public and Private</p>
        <p>Norval White lists some of his favorite New York City buildings -- in no particular order -- and, in an interview with David Kirby, tells why he likes them.</p>
        <p>Former City of Brooklyn Fire Headquarters, 365-367 Jay Street, downtown Brooklyn. 1892. Architect: Frank Freeman.</p>
        <p>As I say in the guide, ''this is a building to write home about. A pow erful Romanesque Revival brick, granite and tile structure.'' It reeks of the remembrances of Louis Sulli van and H. H. Richardson, a great entry arch offering exit to the wait ing fire trucks. Exuberant and lusty.</p>
        <p>Chrysler Building, 405 Lexington Avenue. 1930.  Architect: William Van Alen.</p>
        <p>Art Deco inside and out, this is a building that really deserves the term skyscraper. The fat boxes that followed after the Second World War (air conditioning permitted deep in terior space) are chunky matrons in contrast to this slender tower.</p>
        <p>Former Joseph and Kate Pulitzer House, 11 East 73rd Street. 1900-1903.  Architect: Stanford White of Mc Kim, Mead &amp; White.</p>
        <p>A many arched and columned Ve netian palazzo, its powerful detail gives a plastic, three-dimensional fa 3cade in contrast to its more austere neighbors.</p>
        <p>Riverside Apartments, 4-30 Co lumbia Place, Brooklyn Heights. 1890.  Architect: William Field &amp; Sons.</p>
        <p>Originally embracing a quad rangle, the south and west sides were slashed off by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Open access galleries lead to apartments that en joy cross ventilation. Built for his employees by philanthropist Alfred T. White. Deeply modeled steel is set within brickwork.</p>
        <p>Wall Street Plaza, 88 Pine Street. 1973.  Architect: I. M. Pei &amp; Associ ates.</p>
        <p>Crisply elegant, this is one of the few post-Chrysler Buildings to achieve class. Skyscrapers in gen eral have been a motley lot. This is a distinguished exception.</p>
        <p>Rockefeller Center, originally Fifth to Sixth Avenues, 48th to 50th Streets. 1932-1940.  The Associated Architects: Reinhard &amp; Hofmeister; Corbett, Harrison &amp; MacMurray; Raymond Hood, Godley &amp; Fouilhoux.</p>
        <p>The original complex is the grand est urban complex of the 20th centu ry; and so said for the sum of its parts, rather than individual details. Embracing Rockefeller Plaza, it has shown what a city can do when it does its best.</p>
        <p>King Model Houses, along 138th and 139th Streets, between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Frederick Douglass Boulevards. 1891-1893.  Architects: North side of 139th Street, Stanford White; north side of 138th Street, Bruce Price &amp; Clarence Luce; south side of 138th Street, James Brown Lord.</p>
        <p>Terraces, in the English sense, these row houses form a totality greater than the sum of their parts. Variety of detail, and even of style, give the complex a richness absent in many otherwise pleasant row-house groupings.</p>
        <p>University Club, 1 West 54th Street. 1899.  Architect: Charles Mc Kim of McKim, Mead &amp; White.</p>
        <p>McKim did the grander work of the partnership (Columbia Universi ty, old Pennsylvania Station), while Stanford White was the more notori ous. This super-palazzo was made possible by the elevator, but it gives the flavor of what 15th and 16th century Florence might have looked like if they had them!</p>
        <p>Grand Central Terminal, 42nd Street at Park Avenue. 1903-1913.  Architects: Reed &amp; Stem and War ren &amp; Wetmore. Restoration archi tects: Beyer Blinder Belle.</p>
        <p>New York's great in-town space for celebration of arrival. Since the demolition of Penn Station, Grand Central has stepped into the leader ship place, and with renewed gran deur after its loving restoration.</p>
        <p>Former James Watson House, 7 State Street. 1793-1806.  Attributed to John McComb Jr.</p>
        <p>An early mansion, its exterior still intact, gives the flavor of old New York at the time of the Treaty of Paris (ending the Revolutionary War). A vigorous facade of free-standing Ionic columns makes this a major example of ''Federal'' (style) architecture. Country houses, such as Gracie Mansion and the Van Cort landt House are lovely parts of rural history. This was at the heart of urban and urbane New York.</p>
        <p>Rockefeller Apartments, 17 West 54th Street. 1936.  Architect: Harrison &amp; Fouilhoux.</p>
        <p>One of the few distinguished mod ern apartment houses in the city, it shelters an interior garden and presents glorious round bay win dows to the street and Museum of Modern Art garden opposite.</p>
