        <p>It was the Mets' best chance against the Milwaukee Brewers tonight, and Manager Bobby Valentine was not going to let it pass. So after his fourth and fifth hitters led off the eighth inning with singles, Valentine replaced them with pinch-runners.</p>
        <p>Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura went back to the dugout; Kurt Abbott went out to second base, Joe McEwing to first.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure he had his reasons,'' Brewers Manager Davey Lopes said of Valentine, who is a friend. ''But I've never seen it before.''</p>
        <p>Valentine acknowledged that the strategy was risky, but he was aware that Bob Wickman, the Brewers' closer, would be pitching the ninth inning. So he put in the pinch-runners and let Todd Zeile, Jay Payton and a pinch-hitter, Matt Franco, take their chances.</p>
        <p>Zeile, who might have bunted had he got a better count, popped out. Payton struck out. Then Franco lashed a liner toward right field.</p>
        <p>In the Brewers' dugout, Lopes started to scream. Then he stopped himself -- two coaches, Gary Allenson and Chris Speier, had told second baseman Ron Belliard to move back a few feet just before Curtis Leskanic's pitch, and Belliard, playing on the outfield grass, snared the ball for the out.</p>
        <p>Wickman retired the side in order in the ninth to preserve the Brewers' 3-2 victory. Wickman lowered his earned run average to 1.15 in earning his eighth save.</p>
        <p>The Mets left nine runners on base and lapsed into the pattern they have displayed in most of Glendon Rusch's starts this season, failing to give him sufficient run support. But Rusch would hear none of that. The left-hander was discouraged with his control, which abandoned him as it had never before.</p>
        <p>Rusch allowed only three hits in six and a third innings, but he issued six walks. Rusch did not allow his sixth walk this season until his eighth start, and he entered the game averaging 1.3 walks per nine innings, tied with his teammate Rick Reed for first in the National League in that category.</p>
        <p>Each of Rusch's walks tonight came in a different inning, keeping him in trouble. The positive thing, he said, was that he was missing outside, not over the plate. But Rusch was not looking at the positive.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if I've ever been that off,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Rusch tries not to show emotion on the mound and usually succeeds. But his feelings betrayed him tonight, and he wore a disbelieving look for much of the game. As a control specialist, Rusch is especially frustrated when he puts himself in jams.</p>
        <p>''I'm very hard on myself as far as that's concerned,'' he said. ''I kind of pride myself on going out there and making the other team beat me by hitting the ball. That's probably the most frustrating, to walk a lot of guys and give them something they didn't necessarily earn.''</p>
        <p>Belliard homered on Rusch's first pitch, but Milwaukee had only one more hit until the sixth inning. The Brewers are second to last in the National League in batting, so their futility was not surprising. They finally took advantage in the sixth, after two former Mets reached base. Luis Lopez -- traded for the departed Bill Pulsipher -- was hit by a pitch, and Charlie Hayes -- released in spring training -- drew a walk. After a groundout advanced the runners to second and third, Marquis Grissom grounded a single just under second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo's glove. Both runs scored as Derek Bell's throw home arrived late, and the Brewers had a 3-2 lead.</p>
        <p>Those runs erased a lead the Mets had gained in the fifth when Jason Tyner raced home from first on a single by Mike Piazza. Tyner dumped a single into left field to lead off, and he was still on first when Piazza came to bat with two outs. Piazza ripped a single to right-center, and Grissom, playing deep in center field, fielded it on the run and threw across his body to Belliard. Tyner never stopped running, and Belliard turned and threw well wide of the plate. Tyner probably would have scored anyway, but he scored easily. The Mets rank 14th among the league's 16 teams in stolen bases, but in Tyner they have a true speedster.</p>
        <p>''I'm not used to guys playing as deep on a hitter as they do on Mike,'' said Tyner, who could not recall if he had ever scored from first on a single. ''I just tried to run hard.''</p>
        <p>That is what the Mets' pinch-runners would have done in the eighth inning, but they never got the chance.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Mets play their last game ever at County Stadium on Sunday. The Brewers move into new Miller Park next season. . . . DEREK BELL went hitless in five at-bats Saturday and has failed to drive in a run in 18 of his last 19 games. He is batting .127 since May 22. . . . The right-hander BOBBY J. JONES will make his second start for Class AAA Norfolk on Sunday. In his first Norfolk start last Wednesday, Jones gave up four earned runs in four innings, but BOBBY VALENTINE said he showed a sharp curveball and fastball. The Mets have told Jones they will promote him to start against Pittsburgh on Friday.</p>
