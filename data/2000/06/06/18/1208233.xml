        <p>GETTING out of bed and standing up was the hardest thing. Now, on his knees, muscles straining in slender forearms, Kerry Heckman braced his arms flat on the back of a golden-coated dog and lifted himself erect. He reached for his cane, patted the dog and smiled.</p>

        <p>GETTING out of bed and standing up was the hardest thing. Now, on his knees, muscles straining in slender forearms, Kerry Heckman braced his arms flat on the back of a golden-coated dog and lifted himself erect. He reached for his cane, patted the dog and smiled.</p>
        <p>''I want to have part of my life back,'' the Pittsburgh man said, two years after he was hit by a drunken driver while delivering mail. ''I'm going to go back to work. I'm going to be the first person in the history of the Post Office to use a service dog.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Heckman, 34, will be able to pursue that dream because of a program here at the Children's Village in which troubled adolescents train service dogs from puppyhood, then give them to handicapped people.</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday, four dogs were turned over to new owners during ceremonies on the Children's Village campus. The owners had completed a two-week ''boot camp'' at the village in which they learned to care for, command and bond with their dogs.</p>
        <p>It's all done through the after-school WAY program -- Work Appreciation for Youth -- which prepares village residents for jobs.</p>
        <p>''I can't think of a better program,'' Nan Dale, the president of the Children's Village, said. ''You watch a dog pick up something its master cannot get, and that side of the benefits is obvious. But our kids need to feel they have within them something important to give to others. This gives them a whole new way of seeing themselves.''</p>
        <p>The dogs are a lifeline. Both ways.</p>
        <p>''Since I've had Dino,'' Mr. Heckman said, patting his 18-month-old golden Labrador on his broad back, ''it's the first time I've slept regularly in a bed in two years.'' Sometimes, because of the pain of getting out of bed, he slept on a chair.</p>
        <p>What the program does for the dogs' young trainers is equally dramatic, said Dr. Michael Osborn, the head psychiatrist at the Children's Village for the last 15 years.</p>
        <p>''It is elemental to human nature to connect empathetically,'' Dr. Osborn said. ''When a human being gives help and nurture, their self-esteem becomes stronger, and they can help more. With the boys and the dogs, it's almost like parent and child. The puppies are so wonderfully appealing, and they give the enjoyment of physical contact: they lick your face. The nonthreatening comfort of physical contact is something these young men may not have experienced.</p>
        <p>''But more important is the increasing self-esteem and self-restraint that comes with having anything depend on you. Some young men who had not been able to deal with frustration just blossomed. It's a wonderful thing to see.''</p>
        <p>Anthony F., 16, of the Bronx said: ''It relieves a lot of anger. It helps you forget a lot of bad things.''</p>
        <p>David C., 16, of Brooklyn, said he found it hard to relinquish Carmichael, a black Labrador. With the puppy, he said, he was teacher and pupil. ''When Carmichael challenged me, I learned to get around it.''</p>
        <p>Candace Rashada, the director of the WAY program, has observed this change. ''David is more patient now,'' she said. ''Someone attacked David recently, and he didn't retaliate. Six months ago, he would have.''</p>
        <p>This fall David will be attending the prestigious Rice High School in Manhattan on a scholarship.</p>
        <p>Lois Pappalarto, 50, of Roslyn, N.Y., likes to talk about what Carmichael has done for her.</p>
        <p>''He's given me more independence,'' said Miss Pappalarto, who for 40 years has had Friedreich's ataxia, a progressive disease that is a form of muscular dystrophy. ''I don't worry about visiting friends now. He'll return stuff off the floor and open doors in some cases.''</p>
        <p>Miss Pappalarto cannot unclench her hands. David C. taught Carmichael not just to fetch but to reach deep into the wheelchair and drop things in her arms.</p>
        <p>Why golden retrievers and Labradors?</p>
        <p>''They're amiable dogs,'' said Lu Picard, the chief executive of East Coast Assistance Dogs, which supplies the dogs and supervises the training. ''They're 'ask' dogs: tell me what you want. They've been bred to pick up, to serve, for thousands of years. Seeing-eye dogs, which are usually shepherds, are herding dogs. They're more 'tell' dogs. They take charge.''</p>
        <p>Katy, a black Labrador retriever, has been taught to hand a phone to her owner, Courtney Lawson, 19, of West Hartford. Courtney, who has cerebral palsy, use a wheelchair and will be going to Edinboro College in Pennsylvania with Katy to pursue a degree in social work.</p>
        <p>''It took a while for us to bond,'' she said, looking at the half-asleep dog at her side, ''but now she wakes up if I even move.''</p>
        <p>Not all the handicaps are physical. Holly Rosig, 20, of Staten Island was badly beaten by a male companion.  ''Since then I've had panic disorder and agoraphobia, fear of open spaces,'' she said. ''At first I couldn't leave my house or have any man near me. Not even my father.''</p>
        <p>Now her world is the three blocks surrounding her residence, an area in which she shops and goes to college. She hopes to expand it with Rock, her golden retriever. ''He is my rock,'' she said. ''He's my support person. Otherwise, I can't go out alone.''</p>
