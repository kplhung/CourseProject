        <p>A residential complex planned for the far West Village has poisoned the air between neighbors, with one side accusing the other of selling out.</p>
        <p>The Waywest Development Company wants to erect an 11-story building on an L-shaped parking lot at 756 Washington Street, between West 12th and Bethune Streets. The building would contain 68 units.</p>
        <p>But residents of one building at Westbeth, the 30-year-old federally subsidized artists' housing complex, say the tower would block much of the natural light they need. ''Northern light is very treasured by artists,'' said Marion Lane, a painter and sculptor who  lives in the northeast corner of the building, at 55 Bethune Street. ''There would be much less light in my small studio apartment.''</p>
        <p>The plan, however, has the support of the tenants' association at 380 West 12th Street, a cooperative that butts up against the northern end of the parking lot. ''While I would love it if nothing happened, that is not fair to the owner of the property,'' said Ron Wulf, an accountant and a director of the association.</p>
        <p>Occupants of 380 West 12th Street had first opposed the project as too bulky. But with the help of some resident architects, the building and the developer forged a compromise that calls for a 3,000-square-foot plaza at the north end of the lot, where some of the co-op's balconies are situated.</p>
        <p>The inclusion of a landscaped plaza also allowed the developer to build several stories higher than it could without the plaza.</p>
        <p>''They are getting a plaza and we are getting a high-rise,'' said Kate Walter, a Westbeth tenant.</p>
        <p>But Waywest, which converted 380 West 12th Street into co-ops two decades ago, said its design had minimal impact on  Westbeth and would enhance the area.</p>
        <p>''Anything we build will be an improvement over a garage parking lot,'' said Milton E. Shapiro, a partner in the company. ''It will be nicer to look at than cars.''</p>
        <p>Waywest has asked the city's Board of Standards and Appeals for a variance, which it would need for this manufacturing zone. A final ruling is expected July 18.</p>
        <p>This neighborhood of town houses and tree-lined streets has seen much real estate activity lately. Two residential buildings were completed recently on Jane Street, two blocks north of Westbeth. Richard Meier, who designed the conversion of Westbeth, is erecting two glass condominium buildings on Perry Street, one block to its south.</p>
        <p>Some residents call this overdevelopment. Soon, said Arthur Strickler, district manager of Community Board 2, ''there will not be an empty lot left anywhere.''</p>
