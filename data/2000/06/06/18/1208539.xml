        <p>Five men accused of being among several groups of revelers who attacked women in Central Park last Sunday were arraigned in State Supreme Court in Manhattan last night.</p>
        <p>The police have charged 15 people in the attacks. The men are accused of groping, fondling and molesting 50 women in and near the park following the National Puerto Rican Day Parade. In several incidents, victims' clothes were ripped off.</p>
        <p>In criminal complaints released in court yesterday, prosecutors painted the most detailed official picture of the attacks, alleging that several of the victims were anally and vaginally penetrated by some of the suspects. Most of the defendants arraigned yesterday turned themselves in after seeing their pictures on television or in newspapers, their lawyers said.</p>
        <p>Leslie Marcano, 19, of the Bronx was charged with aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse and rioting after one of the victims told prosecutors that he had forced his finger into her vagina in a mob attack near Sixth Avenue and 59th Street. Mr. Marcano's bail was set at $45,000. Another defendant, Trevor Britton, 29, of Brooklyn, was held in $20,000 bail after a victim said he was in a group that sexually assaulted her and then stole her purse. He was charged with sexual abuse, riot and robbery.</p>
        <p>The other defendants arraigned last night were Jason Commissiong, 20, of Brooklyn; Isaiah Forbes, 18, of Queens; Jensen Soto, 16, of Brooklyn; Mark Daniels, 21, of Irvington, N.J.; and Julio de la Cruz, 22, of North Bergen, N.J. They were charged with sexual abuse and rioting, and bail was set at $15,000 to $25,000 each.</p>
        <p>The police also released photographs of seven additional suspects yesterday.</p>
        <p>One suspect, Anthony Bryant, 25, of Delancey Street in Manhattan, was released by the police yesterday after they concluded that a victim had been mistaken when she had accused him of attacking her.</p>
        <p>Last week, prosecutors arraigned 10 other suspects.</p>
        <p>The attacks took place over several hours as crowds milled in sweltering, 90-degree heat along Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue during and after the annual parade. Roving groups of men doused women with beer, water and ice while ripping off their clothes and grabbing at various body parts. Since then, the Police Department has begun an internal investigation over what many witnesses have called inaction by officers stationed in the area.</p>
