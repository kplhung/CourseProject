        <p>Observing its 16th year as a partnership with the county and Peekskill, Westchester Resco, a refuse-to-energy plant at Charles Point, announced last week that it had recycled 10 million tons of trash and turned it into electric power.</p>
        <p>Tom Maillet, manager of the plant, said 10 million tons is roughly equivalent to 10 million barrels of oil -- or 6.4 million megawatts of electric power, which in turn has provided 40,000 homes with electricity since the plant opened in 1984.</p>

        <p>Resco is an acronym for Refuse Energy Systems Company, a company that is privately owned by Wheelabrator Technologies of Hampton, N.H.</p>
        <p>Last year, the plant completed a Clean Air Act retrofit, installing equipment to reduce air pollution.</p>
