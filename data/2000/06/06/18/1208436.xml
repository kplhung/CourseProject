        <p>Anyone who is not sick of bovine-related wordplay already will probably be soon: West Orange officially opens ''Cow Parade,'' an unusual summerlong art exhibition, on Friday, and the puns are piling up.</p>
        <p>For weeks artists have been decorating 28 life-size fiberglass cows that will be displayed around town. New York has a similar enterprise under way. It's all an attempt to duplicate a fund-raising and publicity gimmick that succeeded in Chicago and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The problem is, the very mention of cows seems to send the human wordplay gene into overdrive. ''West Orange Wrangles a Prime Art Show'' is typical of recent headlines, and the headline writers are outdone only by the organizers themselves.</p>
        <p>Thus Friday's festivities include a ''Cattle Call'' at the Essex Green promenade from 9 to 11 a.m. (featuring a ''mootricious breakfast''), an evening ''Hoe-Down and Hullaba-moo'' at Town Hall and the kickoff of a ''Read Till the Cows Come Home'' program. The cows will be on exhibit through Sept. 4.</p>
