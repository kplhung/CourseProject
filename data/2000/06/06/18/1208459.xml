        <p>Under a full moon, shortly before midnight, Vittorio Giunta, a Roman hairdresser, trimmed the hair of Isabella Morandi, 30, a client who is convinced that this phase of the lunar cycle will make her locks grow back faster, and thicker.</p>
        <p>The haircut, however, also broke the law.</p>
        <p>No police officer raced in to arrest Mr. Giunta, but his small act of civil disobedience is not likely to go unnoticed. Mr. Giunta, 48, an elegant man whose white hair and goatee is set off by sleek black shirts and trousers, is a rebel with an unlikely cause. He is fighting city government, two hairdressers' unions and dozens of small trade associations for the right to keep his shop open when the moon is full.</p>
        <p>He and some of his clients believe that the best time to cut hair is under a full moon, an ancient superstition that has not entirely died out in Italy. That belief, however, clashes with a more widespread superstition about free market ''chaos,'' a fear that has kept rigid and jealously guarded regulations on hundreds of thousands of small family businesses in place.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giunta's desire to set his own working hours has introduced a frisson of American-style capitalism to a society that is slowly and painfully adjusting its dolce vita to the free market demands of a global economy.</p>
        <p>''I need to express myself artistically during the full-moon hours,'' said Mr. Giunta, who owns Capellimania, a small salon in a middle-class residential neighborhood in Rome. ''Besides, if you move to a free market, then you can't stop individual initiative.''</p>
        <p>In many ways, Italy has changed drastically since the days when all shop shutters would rumble shut at 1 p.m. for lunch and naps, opening again at 4 p.m., and no store was open on Sunday. Regulations that forbid a salami store from selling sandwiches or a shoe store from selling shirts were removed last year. The red tape needed to open a new store was cut back. And, in its most revolutionary step, the same law allowed shopkeepers to set their own hours in a 13-hour maximum working day. A few shops are even open on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The new law, which was only grudgingly accepted by Italy's 600,000 businesses, did not apply to a million other small businesses that fall into the category of artisanry, which includes bakers, auto mechanics, furniture makers and hairdressers, who still operate under old rules, many of them 30 years old. Hairdressers, for example, must open at 9 a.m. and shut at 7 p.m. and have to close on Mondays.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giunta's daring experiment has not won the support of many colleagues.</p>
        <p>''The full moon thing is folklore -- it is quite idiotic,'' said Danilo Garone, national secretary of Federacconciatori, one of Italy's main hairdressing trade associations.</p>
        <p>Italy has more than 100,000 hair salons. Mr. Garone said the vast majority of hairdressers were adamantly opposed to liberalizing hours.</p>
        <p>''If I close at 7 p.m. and a rival across the street stays open until 11 p.m. I'll be forced to stay open, too,'' he said. ''I have heard that in New York hair salons stay open all hours and even serve food, but we are a traditional country. We don't need these changes at all.''</p>
        <p>Increasingly, however, Italy's economists and elected officials feel obliged to conform with changes already sweeping not just the United States but other parts of Europe. Chains, supermarkets and shopping malls are competing with small family-owned shops in Italy, though not as fast as elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''In Italy, competition is seen as harmful, and it makes you work too hard,'' said Luca Pellegrini, vice president of the Center of Commercial Studies at Bocconi University in Milan. ''We have a humane and pleasant way of life, and we have a hard time adapting to inevitable change.''</p>
        <p>Patricia Ninci, president of the Commerce and Productive Activities Commission for the city of Rome, does want change, and has embraced liberalization of store hours. She described Mr. Giunta's idea as ''cute'' and said she would try to raise his request at a meeting next week, though she said she preferred group or neighborhood initiatives.</p>
        <p>''The administration cannot impose liberalization,'' she said. ''The idea has to be embraced by the businesses themselves. Many don't see the potential economic advantages of liberalization, they remain tied to the habits of the past.''</p>
        <p>But even she balked at the idea that stores could someday decide for themselves when to hold sales. The new law actually imposes new restrictions on sales periods, which in Rome can now take place only in February and mid-July to mid-August.</p>
        <p>''You are depreciating the art of commerce, reducing the transaction to just the price,'' she said, appalled at the notion of wildcat sales.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ninci, who used to run a clothing store, said there was an immense difference between liberalizing store hours and permitting price wars. ''Its unfair competition and Roman retail would be ruined.''</p>
        <p>Haircuts were free on Friday night at Capellimania, and the shop was crammed with clients eager to benefit from a full-moon trim.</p>
        <p>''Since Babylonian times, farmers planted when the moon was full,'' Ms. Morandi explained earnestly. ''But it also makes sense to allow salons and shops to stay open late. If a city like Rome wants to be in the same league as Paris, or New York or London, then it has to offer people the same choices.''</p>
