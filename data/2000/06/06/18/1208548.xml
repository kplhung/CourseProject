        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report (news article, June 11) that the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has finally begun to crack down on programs that force interns and residents to work exceedingly long hours. As the chairman of the commission that inspired the enactment of the New York State laws that regulate residents' working conditions, I find your article heartening.</p>
        <p>If the council really believes that the quality of patient care is compromised by hospitals that violate the standards, then they should publicly identify those hospitals and ''disaccredit'' those training programs that refuse to comply.</p>

        <p>The private agencies that evaluate and accredit medical education and medical care must prove that they can enforce standards. Or is government regulation of these federally financed programs the answer?</p>
