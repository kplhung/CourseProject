        <p>FRESH AIR FIEND</p>
        <p>Travel Writings, 1985-2000.</p>
        <p>By Paul Theroux.</p>
        <p>466 pp. Boston:</p>
        <p>Houghton Mifflin Company. $27.</p>
        <p>PAUL THEROUX has been everywhere. By this, I don't just mean that he has camped under the stars on a deserted Micronesian island, kayaked to Nantucket, traversed the Tibetan plateau from Golmud to Lhasa, skied cross-country in Maine and escaped a charging hippo in Zambia. True, he's done all these things, and more. But he has also published his accounts of such adventures in what seems like almost every magazine on earth that runs travel features -- which is to say, almost every magazine on earth, from Granta to Bon Appetit, from Worth to Vogue.</p>
        <p>This blooming profusion of exotic assignments is due, of course, to the success and well-deserved acclaim of Theroux's past travel books, particularly ''The Great Railway Bazaar'' and ''Riding the Iron Rooster.'' In the tried-and-true economics of publishing, books beget magazine contracts, which in turn cover mortgage payments while the author is writing more books. The idea that it's impossible to serve the opposing gods of art and commerce is just romantic nonsense. Many gifted writers manage quite nimbly to stay on excellent terms with both, and Theroux is one of the nimblest of all.</p>
        <p>In recent years, he's earned a reputation as a somewhat prickly character -- both for his frequent grousing on the road and, especially, for his friendship-nuking memoir of V. S. Naipaul, ''Sir Vidia's Shadow.'' But when it comes to dealing with his editors, Theroux is clearly the most agreeable of men. That much becomes clear when you flip to the last pages of ''Fresh Air Fiend'' and match each essay with the publication that originally commissioned it. Writing in Outside, Theroux strikes that magazine's perfect note of sunburned sensitivity. (''In the heat of the day I crouched under my flapping tent fly and read Celine.'') For Gourmet, he notices the food. (''The pheasant and okra gumbo, hearty and flavorful, was meant to restore us after our day of skiing.'') On assignment for National Geographic, he waxes lyrical about the photogenic scenery. (''In the extravagant African sunset, the Zambezi River was deep red, reflecting the crimson sky.'') For Vanity Fair, he goes weak-kneed over a Hollywood hunk. (''Peter Weir and Harrison Ford had gone down to look at the jungle, and Ford himself had ended up clearing a piece of land with a huge machete.'')</p>
        <p>But there are plenty of common threads to Theroux's essays, too. No matter what audience he's addressing, he rarely resists the temptation to hold forth on what travel -- and travel writing -- is all about. When he gets going in this vein, Theroux starts to sound like Thoreau: '' 'Connected' is the triumphant cry these days. Connection has made people arrogant, impatient, hasty and presumptuous. . . . I found out much more about the world and myself by being unconnected.'' The trick, he says, is to discover places that force you to look rather than merely sightsee. And it's a paradox of today's plugged-in world that such places are as likely to be found 10 miles from home as 10,000. In one of his best pieces, ''Connected in Palau,'' Theroux goes to an uninhabited South Pacific island laden with a satellite phone, a camcorder, a palm-sized computer, a shortwave radio and various other circuitry, then watches it all die for want of batteries, the digital chirps giving way to the silent beating of fruit bats' wings above the beach.</p>
        <p>Since the ''Odyssey,'' travel writing has always been about recycling your best material, so perhaps it's unfair to complain that Theroux often repeats himself. But these repetitions are especially grating when they're uttered in didactic mode, like the graduation day homilies of a much-loved teacher who's gone just slightly dotty: ''You have to find out for yourself. Take the leap. Go as far as you can. Try staying out of touch. Become a stranger in a strange land. Acquire humility.'' And do we really need to hear yet again what that old beachcomber told Theroux on the shore of northern Queensland, or the story about how ''The Great Railway Bazaar'' inspired Bruce Chatwin to go off and write ''In Patagonia''?</p>
        <p>Actually, though, of the dozen or so essays about other travel writers that Theroux includes, the most interesting is the one on Bruce Chatwin. Here Theroux recounts a conversation in which Chatwin asked him, in typically pointed fashion, what he did not like about ''In Patagonia.'' ''I said straight off that it bothered me that he never explained the difficulties and in-betweens of travel -- where he slept, what he ate, what kind of shoes he wore,'' Theroux recalls. (One wishes that Theroux had then asked Chatwin what he did not like about ''The Great Railway Bazaar.'')</p>
        <p>Theroux made the strange decision to include in this volume a number of his prefaces to recent editions of his other books. Apparently he expected them to form a kind of literary autobiography, but instead they just feel like padding, or like so many empty dust jackets. In fact, Theroux is far more appealing when he's talking about other people -- especially when he lets his sense of humor gain the upper hand. His account of a cruise down the Yangtze with a group of American millionaires is as wicked as anything he ever said about Naipaul, and far funnier.</p>
        <p>FOR all his airy exhortations to travel, nothing annoys Theroux as much as other travelers -- or, even worse, tourists. On Christmas Island, a prime sport-fishing destination in the South Pacific, he writes, ''There is hardly a wall at the Captain Cook Hotel, one of the island's two hotels, that does not exhibit a photograph of a foreigner, popeyed under the weight of a potbellied, scaly, slack-jawed trophy -- the mirror image of its captor.'' What do you call xenophobia when it's actually the opposite, revulsion toward your own countrymen? Whatever it is, Theroux has got it, and he uses it to good effect -- especially in an essay on the new China, where he portrays American joint-venture executives talking like old-time Maoist cadres: ''We're doing very well. We're on schedule. Everything's going ahead. We have a great team.''</p>
        <p>That article ran in Harper's Magazine, a publication that seems to have brought out the best in Theroux. Other magazine pieces, plucked of their lush plumage of color photographs, look naked and scrawny. But hey, that's the business. There are the ones you write for love and the ones you write for money. Still, I wonder why so prolific an author had to tuck both kinds quite so lovingly between hard covers.</p>
