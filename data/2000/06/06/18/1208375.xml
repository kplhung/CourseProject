        <p>ONCE, snakeskin had the fashion cachet of a prison tattoo. Urban cowboys and rockers wore it. So did creeps. Snakeskin? Think Joey Buttafuoco's signature boots.</p>
        <p>What a difference a little marketing makes. Designers satisfied this year's cash-rich consumers by giving a makeover to python, skin taken from Asian snakes laced with primeval, netlike designs. Yves Saint Laurent sold out its line of $9,250 python trench coats. Jimmy Choo offered $550 python slides in traffic-stopping bright green. A pink python jacket from Chanel, with white chiffon trim and matching skirt, retailed at $8,455. It sold out, too.</p>
        <p>''Python did incredibly well,'' said Mariah Chase, a Jimmy Choo spokeswoman. ''It was all about luxury and exoticism. It was a maximalism kind of thing.''</p>
        <p>For fashion houses, the metamorphosis of python from ruffian chic to Park Avenue popularity has been an irrefutable hit. But among conservationists, the snake's makeover has been ringing alarms. Does it signal a new round of consumers wearing wildlife products with light-headed nonchalance? If so, which animals will be next? And what about those snakes? In an era of shrinking habitat, are there really enough pythons out there to outfit every acquisitive fashion princess?</p>
        <p>Having a python cellphone cover may be unmistakably hip, but it is an image oddly disconnected from the product's origins. A world away from the cubicles where fashion magazine pages are designed, this year's python craze is supplied by an international industry that snatches hundreds of thousands of wild pythons from jungles each year, kills them and ships their skins to European and Asian garment factories, all the while avoiding the notoriety that has dogged other commercial wildlife harvests, from the seal hunters of Newfoundland to the whalers of Japan.</p>
        <p>The python hunt is legal, as is the export of the skins. But conservationists say that no one is certain whether the most heavily traded species, reticulated and blood pythons, both agents of rat control in some of the world's poorest nations, can sustain their numbers under the sort of hunting that keeps department stores stocked.</p>
        <p>Pythons are creatures virtually without advocates. Many details of their lives are unknown.</p>
        <p>''For most of these snakes, there is absolutely no information on what is happening with the hunts or how the species are faring,'' said Dr. John Thorbjarnarson, a herpetologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society, headquartered at the Bronx Zoo. ''That is really a frightening thing.'' Pythons are nonvenomous tropical predators that strike from hiding and then twist their bodies around their prey, flexing their hold until the animal suffocates. The dead victim is swallowed headfirst. Sated pythons slither off to digest.</p>
        <p>Since 1975, trade in these reptiles has been subject to guidelines set by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, or Cites, a wildlife commerce treaty signed by 150 nations, which require each country to establish and supervise a conservation policy. According to the convention, more than 10 million pythons have been reported taken from the wild in the last 15 years.</p>
        <p>The snakes are harvested from a long list of nations, including Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. But the unequivocal export leader is Indonesia, where harvesting pythons is a highly organized business. From 1985 to 1998, the last year for which data are available, Indonesia exported more than 4.5 million pythons, either skinned or alive.</p>
        <p>''It is a huge industry, but it keeps to itself,'' said Kamuran Tepedelen, who owns Bushmaster Reptiles, a Boulder, Colo.-based company that employs Indonesian snake catchers for the pet trade.</p>
        <p>Spokeswomen for four fashion houses that use python said they had no idea where the skins come from, a response evidently little different from that of consumers. ''It's very rare, honestly, that we think about where they come from, and what the ecological impact might be,'' Ms. Chase of Jimmy Choo said.</p>
        <p>The most coveted species in the exotic leather trade is the reticulated python, arguably the largest snake in the world. Reticulated pythons are the anacondas of Asia, having been reported at lengths of more than 30 feet, although 10- to 17-foot snakes are typical. They feed on a variety of vertebrates, including rats, ducks, chickens, porcupines, pigs and monkeys. In rare instances the largest specimens have attacked humans.</p>
        <p>Each year from 1985 to 1998, between 305,000 and 834,000 reticulated pythons were reported harvested worldwide; a large portion came from Indonesia. Actual trade is believed to be larger because of smuggling. Much of the rest of the trade is in skins from blood pythons, fat-bodied snakes that reach maximum lengths of about seven feet. Once  considered uncommon, blood pythons have benefited in recent years as vast tracts of rain forest have  given way to oil palm plantations. These new habitats -- replete with brush piles and palm fruit -- support an extraordinary density of rats.</p>
        <p>Experts say the rats' abundance has allowed blood pythons, which feed on them, to colonize the plantations. And as their numbers have increased, the snakes have attracted skin hunters. In 1985, 32,000 blood pythons were exported worldwide. In 1998, reported shipments reached 127,000.</p>
        <p>To convert pythons into profits, Indonesia's snake-harvesting industry relies on an army of catchers. Most are villagers who simply encounter a snake and pounce on it, selling it later for serendipitous cash. Others are more systematic and take regular walks through the palm plantations, peering into brush piles and plucking blood pythons from hiding places. A few ambitious hunters work in groups, settings nets, traps and baited hooks for the larger reticulated pythons. Captured snakes are stored in canvas bags and sold to primitive skinning plants. What happens next is unsightly, although industry representatives and scientists say it is no more unsettling than what occurs in meat-packing houses around the world.</p>
        <p>The pythons are dumped from their bags and killed by suffocation or mallet blows. The carcasses are hung by their heads and inflated with water. A skinner then slits open the carcass, snips out the guts and scrapes away the meat. Depending on the market, some of the meat ends up being eaten, and some is used as  livestock feed or discarded. In some cases python gall bladders are sold for use in traditional Chinese medicine. But the main product is the skin, which is pegged, dried and sent to tanneries. Most tanned skins are exported to Europe, where they are converted into all manner of clothing and accessories.</p>
        <p>The industry employs about 174,200 people, including everyone from skinners to international sales agents, according to the Indonesian Reptile and Amphibian Trade Association, which represents licensed tanneries and reptile-product exporters. About 150,000 of the workers are snake catchers, most of them in persistently poor regions. They are paid a small sum for each snake.</p>
        <p>''I think the reality is that for these Indonesian villages, the snakes are an important economic resource,'' said Dr. Richard Shine, a University of Sydney herpetologist who toured Indonesian skinning plants for python studies.</p>
        <p>The industry has existed for decades, subject to the capricious moods of the fashion industry and its equally capricious customers. But some conservationists say the skins' recent appearance on the runways is tied as much to the fine points of international trade law as to the vagaries of taste.</p>
        <p>Six years ago, the endangered species convention adopted rules requiring tags and permits for crocodilian products shipped across international borders. These rules, which did not affect snakes directly, complicated shipments for products from certain reptiles -- crocodiles, alligators and caimans -- often causing border delays or seizures, a potential catastrophe for retailers expecting seasonal merchandise.</p>
        <p>Since python skins are not covered by the tagging rules, they cross borders with comparative ease. Experts say this characteristic made them attractive when designers began seeking exotic leather for consumers flush with cash.</p>
        <p>''Snakeskins are not nearly as complicated to import and export,'' said Craig Hoover, of Traffic-North America, the trade monitoring arm of the World Wildlife Fund. ''They just don't run into the same possibilities of delays.''</p>
        <p>Accordingly, wildlife inspectors say they have noticed a significant increase in the number of snakeskin products entering the United States. ''From an industry's standpoint I guess I can understand it,'' said Sheila Einsweiler, a senior inspector for the Fish and Wildlife Service. ''It's a little easier to move snakeskins around.''</p>
        <p>As more skins entered the country and began to bear brand-name labels, python's sudden popularity invigorated a long-running debate among scientists about the species' sustainability. Herpetologists are particularly worried about reticulated pythons, which do not seem to thrive in plantations, and whose skins bear the netlike pattern most desired by designers.</p>
        <p>''Reticulated pythons are giant snakes, remarkable creatures, but they are not adequately protected, and their trade is barely regulated,'' said Peter Brazaitis, a herpetologist and the former curator of animals at the Central Park Wildlife Center.  ''Five years from now, if python fashion keeps going, how many of them will be left?''</p>
        <p>The answers are not clear. Under endangered species trade rules, exporting countries must base their hunts on scientific studies and limit harvests ''to maintain the species throughout its range and at a level consistent with its role in the ecosystem in which it occurs.'' But little field research has been done on Asian pythons. Wildlife experts say there is almost no way of knowing whether the convention's standards are being met and whether the various species, or their roles in the ecosystem, are being preserved.</p>
        <p>Some studies are not encouraging. A 1990 report done for the convention's secretariat noted that for reticulated pythons, ''there is reasonable evidence for a significant decline in Bangladesh, and the species is reported to be depleted locally over much of the remainder of the range, including Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines.''</p>
        <p>But since then, opinions on the hunt's impact have varied. Mr. Tepedelen, of Bushmaster Reptiles, said harvests are sustainable because  catchers generally do not kill immature reptiles, meaning most of those killed have already been allowed to lay clutches of eggs and propagate the species.</p>
        <p>''The species that are in trade are just booming,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Shine, the Australian herpetologist and one of the few scientists who have studied the harvest of reticulated pythons, said he has been surprised by the species's resilience. ''Reticulated pythons have the life history of a garter snake,'' he said. ''They grow fast, mature quickly and have a lot of eggs in each clutch. As a species, it can withstand a fair bit of pressure.''</p>
        <p>In spite of these characteristics,  the species has declined in some areas. ''It's not an issue about extinction, but there is no doubt that the commercial trade is reducing the numbers,'' Dr. Shine said.</p>
        <p>The Indonesian reptile traders' organization has been working with field researchers and the Indonesian government to ensure that the hunt is sustainable. But field biologists caution that sustainable or not, it  may have public health consequences. That is because the snakes are being removed from an ecosystem heavily populated with rats.</p>
        <p>While harvesting pythons may generate profits locally, some scientists say, they leave behind rats, which carries social costs, including increases in disease and damage to crops. ''I think we have to ask ourselves, what is the value of a python?'' said Mr. Brazaitis. ''Is it as a pair of expensive pants? Or is it as a means to check exploding rat populations in nations where communicable diseases are rampant?''</p>
        <p>This month, the knockoff-bag merchants were selling fake python clutches and baguettes on the sidewalks outside Bloomingdale's, a sure sign the snakeskin craze has gone down-market and is nearing its end. And even though python products remained in some display windows throughout the city, a salesman at the Original Leather Store, which operates six boutiques in Manhattan, was pronouncing the snake dead.</p>
        <p>''I'm so sick of it,'' he said, pointing toward a pair of python pants on display overhead, rich maroon hip-huggers, the remains of a mid-size reticulated python. The salesman rolled his eyes and sighed. ''It's going to be very dated, very fast,'' he said. ''I think it's the acid wash of 2000.''</p>
        <p>Whether sinking snakeskin sales in New York City will mean more pythons in the wild is an open question. The skins remain popular in Europe, and snakeskin boots are likely to maintain their hold over would-be rock stars and barroom cowboys.</p>
        <p>But in New York, at least, pythons may soon be getting a reprieve.</p>
        <p>''I've heard,'' the salesman said, ''that in the fall, it's ostrich that will be hot.''</p>
