        <p>ROYSTON VASEY is a small town in northern England as imagined by a British sketch-comedy troupe called ''The League of Gentlemen.'' It might also be hell, as imagined by Hieronymous Bosch and redesigned with post-industrial depravity by some drone in the Home Office.</p>
        <p>An ominous road marker asserts, ''You'll never leave,'' which is morbidly accurate. If death is the only sure escape from the surrealism of life's daily predicaments, why should Royston Vasey offer another choice? Its general store, called the Local Shop, is run by Edward and his wife, Tubbs, a hideously porcine middle-aged couple whose reliance on homicide to abet their xenophobia -- ''This is a local shop, for local people,'' they insist -- is one of their more recognizable psychoses. (That not even local people shop there gradually becomes apparent, and even makes sense.) The town's hapless veterinarian kills more animals than he saves. The butcher makes homemade sausage with a ''special'' ingredient. The transsexual cabdriver, Barbara, discusses every detail of her reassignment surgery with anyone who climbs into her cab.</p>
        <p>A hit on the BBC when it was first broadcast in January 1999, ''The League of Gentleman,'' which makes its American debut Monday night at 10:30, is one of three new shows on Comedy Central's summer schedule, which starts this week. The others are ''Strip Mall'' (tonight at 10:30), a raunchy soap opera-comedy set in a low-rent mall in the San Fernando Valley starring Julie Brown and Victoria Jackson, and "Don't Forget Your Toothbrush'' (Tuesday night at 10), a game show in which contestants, who are packed and ready to go, willingly make fools of themselves in the hope of winning an exotic vacation.</p>
        <p>The new programming joins fresh installments of the network's existing roster: ''Win Ben Stein's Money,'' ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,'' ''Whose Line Is It Anyway,'' ''Strangers With Candy,'' ''The Man Show,''''Turn Ben Stein On'' and, of course, ''South Park,'' the only other show besides ''League of Gentlemen'' with a dateline in the Twilight Zone.</p>
        <p>''We tried to find a town that reminded us of the nastiest places we'd known as children,'' said Mark Gatiss, who, with Steve Pemberton, Reese Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson, creates characters and sketches for the show.</p>
        <p>They found their real-life stage set in the perfectly pleasant Derbyshire town of Hadfield, a community of 6,000 about 10 minutes by rail from Manchester. ''Hadfield is actually really a nice place,'' Mr. Gatiss said, ''but it's not chocolate-box pretty.''</p>
        <p>With the exception of Mr. Dyson, the writers are also the performers, portraying about 60 characters, male and female. ''We wear lots of dresses,'' Mr. Gatiss said.</p>
        <p>The sketches are less dependent on punchlines than they are on cueing the audience with a sense of familiarity, Mr. Gatiss said. In one episode, the ''Gentlemen'' portray a rinky-dink theatrical company called Legz Akimbo that travels from school to school in a filthy white van and performs plays about socially relevant topics -- in this case homosexuality.</p>
        <p>''Do you have a secret?'' one of the actors asks the captive audience of schoolchildren. The message of the play doesn't faze the kids; it's the horror of having to watch three inept actors prove to themselves, in cheap costumes and in front of amateurish cardboard sets, that their careers are going nowhere.</p>
        <p>Another kind of horror resides in the seemingly banal interior of the Local Shop, where Edward and Tubbs stock uncounted items that in all likehihood will never be sold, to customers who will never be seen again. Sheltered by Edward for years, Tubbs's fear of potential customers is an obsession, and she relies on her husband for protection. ''We'll have no trouble here!'' announces Edward to anyone who dares enter. But of course, it's already too late.</p>
        <p>''The League of Gentlemen'' and its willingness to be darkly silly invite comparisons to the mordant humor of Monty Python's Flying Circus, but the men disavow any attempt at imitation.</p>
        <p>''It's very flattering,'' Mr. Gatiss said. ''We grew up watching Monty Python, but we aren't trying to copy them. I suppose you could say we were inspried by them.''</p>
