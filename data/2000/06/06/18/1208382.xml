        <p>PHILLY cheese steak. Thai chicken with roasted peanuts and ginger sauce.</p>
        <p>Purists may cringe, but these are the kinds of toppings that California Pizza Kitchen sprinkles over its paper-thin crusts, to the delight of new-wave pizza fans in 21 states.</p>
        <p>But while the designer pies have  won a following, the question of whether investors will develop a similar taste will be answered only in July,  when the chain, based in Los Angeles, is expected to go public.</p>
        <p>As of Friday, the company had not set a price for its offering or announced how many shares would be available. According to its prospectus, it wants to use the proceeds to pay back about $40 million in bank debt and to buy back some of its $45.4 million of preferred stock.</p>
        <p>The chain has had a mixed record since a pair of lawyers, Larry S. Flax and Richard L. Rosenfield, founded it 15 years ago. During its first seven years, it had a relatively low-key growth plan, gradually opening 23 restaurants. But in 1992, Pepsico  bought a controlling interest, and California Pizza binged, opening 60 outlets in five years.</p>
        <p>Analysts say that under Pepsico's stewardship, the chain showed little aptitude for picking viable locations or maintaining quality. In 1996, sales actually declined at restaurants open at least a year. That year, Pepsico  decided to focus on its soft-drink and snacks businesses, and in 1997 Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill &amp; Company, a New York investment firm, bought a 67.4 percent stake, which is now down to 39.5 percent. The founders remain co-chairmen.</p>
        <p>After Pepsico's departure, the company closed 16 of the 60 restaurants it built in its fast-expansion days. It has since followed a conservative growth plan and now has 100 restaurants to its name, 74 of them  company-owned. And it has upgraded food quality while keeping high service standards, analysts said.</p>
        <p>California Pizza is part of what the industry calls the casual-dining category -- a segment whose sales are expected to grow 8.7 percent a year over the next five years, according to Technomic, a Chicago consulting firm, versus just 5.7 percent for the overall industry.</p>
        <p>Some of California Pizza's recent  figures have been strong. Sales at  company-owned restaurants grew 6.1 percent in 1998, 4.1 percent in 1999 and 6.8 percent during the first three months of 2000. That compares with just 0.6 percent in 1997.</p>
        <p>The numbers impress Ron Paul, president of Technomic, because the casual-dining segment considers annual growth of 2 to 3 percent as ''pretty good.'' He also likes that the average check for California Pizza customers is just $10.50; he thinks casual-dining customers see $10-and-under bills as good value.</p>
        <p>Of course, this is not the hottest market in which to sell restaurant shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's restaurants index is down 21 percent for the year through Friday. And the new-issue market itself is rife with postponements and cancellations.</p>
        <p>California Pizza reported total debt of $40.1 million on April 2. Last year, earnings fell 48.6 percent, to $5.4 million, while overall revenue grew 7.2 percent, to $179.2 million.</p>
        <p>While it is evident that premium pizza is not merely a fad, Phil Lempert, the editor of the Lempert Report, an industry newsletter in Santa Monica, Calif., said California Pizza would have to spend heavily on advertising to remind the public that it also has other items on its menu.</p>
        <p>Others, like Randall Hiatt, a consultant at Fessel International in Irvine, Calif., question whether California Pizza can expand effectively outside its Western base. Indeed, he wonders if the chain is now growing too slowly. While investors have punished restaurant companies that expanded too quickly in the mid-1990's,  he thinks they are now rewarding  those that are pursuing sustained growth, like the Cheesecake Factory and P. F. Chang's China Bistro, whose numbers of outlets are growing at least 15 to 20 percent annually.</p>
        <p>California Pizza has opened only 10 company-owned restaurants since the beginning of 1998; four are under construction. ''I don't think the market will sustain low growth in this industry,'' Mr. Hiatt said. ''I think the company is going to have to expand geographically.''</p>
