        <p>A family trip to a theme park is, under the best of circumstances, a mix of pleasure and pain. So it's fitting, perhaps, that using the Internet to plan a theme park excursion can yield similar degrees of ambivalence.</p>
        <p>One might expect theme park operators to have focused by now on the Web as a perfect marketing vehicle. At the moment, Internet users are more affluent than the average citizen, and are therefore more likely to have the income to haul the kids across multiple state lines for a few days of battling the masses in pursuit of family fun.</p>

        <p>A family trip to a theme park is, under the best of circumstances, a mix of pleasure and pain. So it's fitting, perhaps, that using the Internet to plan a theme park excursion can yield similar degrees of ambivalence.</p>
        <p>One might expect theme park operators to have focused by now on the Web as a perfect marketing vehicle. At the moment, Internet users are more affluent than the average citizen, and are therefore more likely to have the income to haul the kids across multiple state lines for a few days of battling the masses in pursuit of family fun.</p>
        <p>But in fact operators like the Walt Disney Company and Anheuser-Busch, which owns the Busch Gardens and SeaWorld parks, among others, are inconsistent in how helpful they are to those looking for guidance. In short, for all the thrills these sites dispense, there are plenty of spills.</p>
        <p>There is certainly no lack of theme park information available online. Any search engine like Yahoo.com, Google.com or AltaVista.com will turn up so-called ''aggregator'' sites that gather information on a multitude of parks. One such site, and a good launching point, is About.com (go to themeparks.about.com).</p>
        <p>For those who know where they -- or, more to the point, their children -- want to go, any theme park worth its cotton candy has a Web site. In an ideal world, each of these sites would cover the basics for any Internet user. You should be able to read descriptions of the attractions, order tickets, explore accommodations and get directions. With a little technological acumen, the sites could also offer weather information, airline and hotel booking and a  spreadsheet for planning trip expenses.</p>
        <p>In reality, of course, no sites offer all these amenities, and few offer more than two or three. Among the most highly visited parks, the ones with the deepest pockets have better Web sites than their peers.</p>
        <p>The companies that operate in and around the theme park mecca of Orlando -- Disney, Universal Studios, and Anheuser-Busch --  have set up useful, if imperfect, Web sites. My family made good use of the Web site for Disney's theme parks (www.disney.com), for example, before our recent pilgrimage.</p>
        <p>Like SeaWorld (www.seaworld.com) and Universal Studios (www.universalstudios .com), Disney allows users to buy tickets and view photos and descriptions of different rides. The Disney World site also has a helpful interactive vacation planner, where users type the dates they want to visit, the ages of their children, and where they are staying, among other things, and  receive information tailored to their needs -- such as shuttles from the airport to Disney hotels and weather information.</p>
        <p>The sites for the Orlando theme parks don't provide links for travel arrangements or hotels that are not affiliated with the parks, but that may be asking a bit much, given what other theme park Web sites lack.</p>
        <p>Web sites for Six Flags (www.sixflags .com) feature a (repetitive) musical introduction and ''real time video'' of the parks, but don't allow users to buy tickets online nor do they offer much help with accommodations. The same goes for Hersheypark (www.hersheypark.com) and Dollywood (www.dollywood.com), Dolly Parton's musical theme park. (All three plan to add ticket capability in the future, according to representatives of the parks.).</p>
        <p>Henry Harteveldt, an online travel analyst with Forrester Research, summed up the majority of the theme park Web sites with one word: ''Sad.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''These guys deserve to stand in a long line on a hot day, with watered-down soda and melting cotton candy for this.''</p>
