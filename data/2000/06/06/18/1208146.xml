        <p>ANTONY SHER is the first to acknowledge that the majority of ''Macbeth'' productions don't work, almost as if the supernatural component to Shakespeare's play were casting a hex on it in performance. Added to that was his first exposure to the text, as a schoolboy in his native South Africa, where, the actor said, ''It was taught appallingly, so I had no real experience of it.''</p>
        <p>It is easy, then, to imagine the mixture of excitement and trepidation with which Mr. Sher and his director, Gregory Doran, approached the play when they chose to revive it for the Royal Shakespeare Company in November. The production went on to be praised as the company's best in decades -- that is to say, since Judi Dench and Ian McKellen played Shakespeare's murderous couple for the director Trevor Nunn in 1976.</p>
        <p>The current staging ended a sellout London run on June 3 and has transferred intact to the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, where it is being presented through next Sunday as part of that city's annual International Festival of Arts and Ideas.</p>
        <p>''Macbeth'' devotees may rightly feel sated at the moment. The Royal Shakespeare version is arriving hot on the heels of a Broadway staging that stars Kelsey Grammer and is directed by Terry Hands, who coincidentally happens to be both a longtime colleague of Mr. Sher's and a former artistic director of the R.S.C. Mr. Grammer opened in the play on Thursday at the Music Box Theater, with Diane Venora as Lady Macbeth. (For ultra-fans of the play, the Gorilla Repertory Theater Company has revived its version, which winds up a series of free performances outdoors at Fort Tryon Park in northern Manhattan on Thursday night and Saturday night.)</p>
        <p>Broadway sees relatively few productions of ''Macbeth,'' even if Mr. Grammer did previously inherit the role for six weeks in 1980 at Lincoln Center. That was before the actor's work in the television hits ''Cheers'' and ''Frasier,'' when, not long out of the Juilliard School, he was cast as Lennox and then stepped in for the leading actor, Philip Anglim, in a production at the Vivian Beaumont Theater directed by Sarah Caldwell.</p>
        <p>In London, on the other hand, and in Europe, where the classics are regularly produced, ''Macbeth'' appears often enough for Mr. Hands to estimate that he has seen the play some 40 times.</p>
        <p>The present Royal Shakespeare production raised expectations in England because it marked Mr. Sher's first foray into Shakespeare's so-called big four (''Hamlet,'' ''Lear'' and ''Othello'' complete the quartet). Mr. Sher has been admired over time as Richard III and Leontes, among other Shakespearean roles that include Lear's Fool, but never as one of the playwright's tragic heroes.</p>
        <p>''It was a hangover from being this little white Jewish South African,'' Mr. Sher said recently. ''For a long time, I wasn't sure whether classical establishment British theater was an area I was allowed to go into; I'd always had a slight sense of being a trespasser.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, Mr. Sher recalled, he acquired the courage to tackle the role, emboldened by a celebrated Zulu ''Macbeth'' in Johannesburg in 1995 -- a staging, he said, that ''worked so superbly.'' (The show, ''Umabatha: The Zulu Macbeth,'' was seen in New York at the 1997 Lincoln Center Festival.) Mr. Sher also returned to the script. ''I reread the play,'' he said, ''and was astonished to find that it reads magnificently. You sense Shakespeare sitting up through several days and nights with this thing pouring out of him.''</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Sher, 50, and his director, Mr. Doran, 40, spoke in separate conversations of having ''an appointment'' with the play. The two share a house in North London, and have been partners for 13 years.</p>
        <p>''By the time we came to do 'Macbeth,' '' Mr. Sher said, ''we needed to do it, and we needed to do it in a certain way.'' But during the seven weeks of rehearsal, the staging actually evolved away from the Jacobean setting first envisioned and toward something more abstract and placeless.''</p>
        <p>''We were trying to distill the play down to an essence,'' said Mr. Doran, a former actor who has previously directed Mr. Sher in ''Titus Andronicus,''  ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' and ''The Winter's Tale.'' This stripping away of ''Macbeth'' meant divesting the play of all extraneous pomp (and, a risk with this play, camp) so that its restless, infernal heart could be laid bare. The three witches, for example, first emerge out of total darkness and later usurp the banquet scene -- startlingly so.</p>
        <p>WE don't believe in witches anymore,'' Mr. Doran said, ''but we do believe in fear. What we did with 'Macbeth' was to begin not from the supernatural but from a much more primal basis.''</p>
        <p>The result somehow creates the feeling of a new play, said Harriet Walter, whose Lady Macbeth has earned her equal praise with Mr. Sher. ''The modern look of the armies,'' the actress said, ''the almost Kosovan atmosphere -- from the kick-off it becomes a kind of modern play, which allows the audience to follow the psychological tension, like a thriller, in a very immediate way.''</p>
        <p>And unlike some versions of ''Macbeth,'' which seem to focus on the title role and merely sketch in the parts around him, this one, Mr. Doran said, is a genuine partnership because ''we had to get Lady Macbeth right before anything.'' Ms. Walter's willowy elegance -- her cool eerily giving way as the play's chaos ensues -- complements the bluff, squat braggadocio of Mr. Sher's warrior-Macbeth.</p>
        <p>Adrian Noble, artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare, has spoken of a possible transfer of the production to Broadway, where Mr. Sher made his debut in 1997 in the Pam Gems play ''Stanley,'' for which he received a Tony nomination.</p>
        <p>But the simultaneous presence of the version involving Mr. Grammer and Mr. Hands now makes that unlikely. ''There certainly wouldn't be two places on Broadway for the play,'' Mr. Sher said.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Grammer, 45, said: ''I don't want to set things up for an embattled comparison. Ours is homegrown, and I'm very excited about the idea of an all-American cast. We may as well put ours out there and let people either shoot it down or applaud it.'' The production, a limited run through July 30, is being presented by the SFX Theatrical Group and Emanuel Azenberg.</p>
        <p>'''The only similarity,'' said Mr. Hands, 59, who saw Mr. Doran's production at its final performance in Stratford (''Maybe he was just coming to pick up a few clues,'' Mr. Doran said jokingly), ''is that ours also is done without an interval.''</p>
        <p>''Look,'' Mr. Hands added, ''I'm delighted. The more Shakespeare we have in North America the better.''</p>
