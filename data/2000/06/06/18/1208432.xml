        <p>Sampdoria is a soccer team that was demoted from Italy's top division, Serie A, in 1999. Last October, the team sold $3.3 million in euro-denominated four-year bonds with a curious feature: if the team managed to climb back into Serie A, the coupon rate would leap from 2.5 percent to 7 percent -- and could double again to a fat 14 percent if the team finished in the top division's top four.</p>

        <p>It was a last-minute letdown for holders of U. C. Sampdoria bonds.</p>
        <p>Sampdoria is a soccer team that was demoted from Italy's top division, Serie A, in 1999. Last October, the team sold $3.3 million in euro-denominated four-year bonds with a curious feature: if the team managed to climb back into Serie A, the coupon rate would leap from 2.5 percent to 7 percent -- and could double again to a fat 14 percent if the team finished in the top division's top four.</p>
        <p>''We linked the yield on the bond to the yield of the team on the field,'' Edoardo Tamburini, the head of equity derivatives at Caboto Sim and the person who thought up the bond, told Bloomberg News. ''This is a bit like a convertible bond, in that its value is linked to indirect financial performance'' -- to wit, the higher ticket and TV revenue that teams earn in Serie A.</p>
        <p>Going into the final matches of the season last Sunday, bondholders still had an outside shot at the windfall. To squeak into a tie for fourth place in Serie B and keep its promotion hopes alive, Sampdoria needed a victory over the relatively weak Alzano Virescit squad and a loss by either Brescia or Atalanta, both facing tough opponents. Sampdoria won, 3-2, on  its home field in Genoa, but Brescia and Atalanta each managed a tie, leaving the bondholders one point short of glory -- and the extra payout.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Sampdoria's embattled president, Enrico Montovani, said that the team would be put up for sale and that he would resign.</p>
