        <p>AFTER successfully combining the jazz saxophonist Jan Garbarek with the Hilliard Ensemble, an early-music outfit, ECM Records now sets its discipline-crossing sights on music of the great Elizabethan lute-song composer John Dowland. The project began as a conventional Dowland recital by John Potter, a tenor who has sung in the Hilliard Ensemble, Electric Phoenix and Red Byrd; and Stephen Stubbs, the lutenist and director of the group Tragicomedia.</p>
        <p>But Manfred Eicher, ECM's founder and producer, persuaded Mr. Potter and Mr. Stubbs to broaden their interpretive horizons. Invited to join the project were Maya Homburger, a violinist in the English Baroque Soloists; John Surman, a saxophonist and clarinetist; and Barry Guy, a bassist who plays in both period-instrument and jazz groups.</p>
        <p>What results, ''In Darkness Let Me Dwell'' (ECM New Series 1697), is a rarity: a crossover project that is both defensible and listenable. Its rationale is that Dowland's music, by nature, allows for both improvisation and flexible instrumentation. The scores, after all, provide a principal vocal melody, several lines of vocal harmony and lute tablature, but where in a modern score these would be requirements, in Dowland's day they were possibilities. Performers could address the music with whatever forces were available: voice or voices with lute, voices with lute and viols, viols only, or a ''broken consort'' of viols and recorders, to cite a few examples.</p>
        <p>In modern times, musicians concerned with historical performance have taken this freedom at face value, and the variety available in Dowland recordings is stunning. Mostly, though, modern performers have sought to recreate the embellishments and instrumentation of Dowland's time, and lately, test suppositions about the accents as well. Abandoning the notion that only a reconstructive approach will do the music justice, Mr. Potter and company have added new instruments to old in readings balanced between the orthodox and the radical. Mr. Potter and Mr. Stubbs stay close to the page, providing fairly literal readings, from which Mr. Surman and Mr. Guy embark on their explorations in a more modern style, with Ms. Homburger supporting either side as needs demand.</p>
        <p>Several of the performances are straightforward. ''Now, O Now I Needs Must Part,'' for example, unfolds with thoughtful scoring and real elegance: some verses or parts of verses are put forth by voice and lute alone; elsewhere, the bass supports the lute in the traditional way, with the violin as a harmony line. When the saxophone joins in an instrumental verse, it behaves almost as a second violin line.</p>
        <p>More often, Mr. Surman and Mr. Guy latch onto Dowland's melancholy, dark-hued texts -- lines like ''my music hellish jarring sounds, to banish friendly sleep,'' in the title song -- and provide nightmarish commentary. Mr. Guy is fond of the metallic, whining, bow-on-the-bridge sound that period-instrument groups use to evoke, for example, the Witches' scene in Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas,'' and Mr. Surman, playing the bass clarinet in its lowest reaches, provides assertive counterpoint.</p>
        <p>They are at their most interesting in a reading of ''Lachrimae Tristes,'' in which Mr. Surman's saxophone alternately joins the ensemble in a literal reading and branches off into decidedly modern fantasies. In ''Go Crystal Tears,'' Mr. Guy plays a jazz-style bass line -- plucked rather than bowed, and with bent notes and brisk fills -- under Ms. Homburger's unadorned rendering of the melody. When Mr. Potter enters, Mr. Guy continues in the style of the opening, and Mr. Surman adds a gentle saxophone counterpoint that later grows into a solo matched to Mr. Guy's style.</p>
        <p>Not all the readings work equally well. Mr. Surman's soprano sax break (so to speak) in ''Come Again'' chirps along a bit too cheerily and nearly dances its way into Kenny G territory. A similarly light-spirited line proves more acceptable in ''Fine Knacks for Ladies,'' which in its instrumental sections takes on the character of a lively dance. Dowland, who reworked many of his songs as galliards, almans and other dances, might have been puzzled by some of the sounds on this disc, but he would have recognized the impulse at play.</p>
