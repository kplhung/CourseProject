        <p>A young mechanic raced up to a woman in her 30's as she tooled down Willets Point Boulevard in her silver 1999 Dodge Stratus. ''Hubcaps, you need hubcaps?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>''Not right now,'' she shouted, while continuing to drive through the  sooty stretch of Flushing, Queens. Her hubcaps had been stolen three months earlier.</p>
        <p>Less than a eighth of a mile down the road -- oil-slicked pavement, actually, where potholes are big enough to hide beach balls -- another mechanic popped out of an auto repair shop as soon as he spied the driver of the Dodge. ''What you need?'' he asked, hungrily. ''What you need?''</p>
        <p>And so it goes, seven days a week, in a tiny corner of grease and grime in the shadow of the No. 7 train and Shea Stadium. At least 70 auto shops honeycomb the boulevard and side streets, specializing primarily in repairs, body work, salvage and wreckage. Many of the shop owners make part-time barkers out of their mechanics because competition is fierce.</p>
        <p>To some degree, Willets Point Boulevard is a graveyard for smashed cars, their parts treated like those of organ donors, replacing the deteriorated parts of once vibrant automobiles. Nearly everywhere there are displays of hubcaps and tires and advertisements for glass repair. Sometimes, hobbled minivans, tractor-trailers, buses and taxis inch down the boulevard.</p>
        <p>Squat tin sheds painted bright colors line the streets and give the place the air of a funky third world bazaar. Despite the taxes business owners pay, there are no sidewalks, no storm drains and no sewer pipes. ''The city doesn't even clean the streets,'' complained Moer Boty, a Moroccan immigrant who works in one of the shops.</p>
        <p>Employees as well as proprietors are a gumbo of sorts. Hispanics, Caribbeans, Asians, East Indians, North Africans, Eastern Europeans and white Americans work side by side, attracting car owners from all over the metropolitan region with cheap prices.</p>
        <p>Though there is competition, ''there are no fights,'' said Dennis Skeahan, a barker who draws business to F&amp;F Auto Salvage. ''We all get along.''</p>
        <p>True, perhaps. A few doors down the road, a price battle was decidedly civil. Marlon Tucker drove to Willets Point from his home in Babylon, on Long Island, for rims for his wheels. He was prepared to do some comparison shopping for the car, a 1995 Nissan Maxima, which he keeps in white-glove condition.</p>
        <p>Jay Singh, a manager at Eighteen Auto Tire Shop, was eager to sell and install the rims for $1,000, but a manager at a tire shop across the street was willing to do the same job for $700, although he did not have the rims yet. The managers and Mr. Tucker discussed the matter in muted tones, and in the end Mr. Tucker climbed into his car to do some more comparison shopping. ''You got to give a brother a break,'' he said, looking at Mr. Singh and smiling. Mr. Singh shrugged.</p>
        <p>Like a girl with a large dowry, Willets Point Boulevard has been highly sought after. People want to turn it into something other than an outdoor auto mall. Part of its allure has to do with its closeness to transportation links, namely the 7 train and the Van Wyck Expressway. There have been grand plans for the boulevard, flanked by the Van Wyck to the west and the Clearview Expressway to the east. There was a proposal to build the grounds for the 1964-65 World's Fair, as well as Shea Stadium. There was the idea of a domed football stadium in 1984, endorsed by the city and, until it got too complex, underwritten by Donald Trump. And more recently there was a proposal for a new baseball stadium for the Mets, along with a massive entertainment complex that would swallow the boulevard. But recently, the entertainment complex proposal was scrapped.</p>
        <p>The Queens borough president, Claire Shulman, ''once stated that the city wants the land for a higher use,'' recalled Joseph Ardizzone, 67, whose parents once owned the land -- wetlands, really, where they raised goats, chickens and vegetables.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ardizzone still lives on Willets Point Boulevard in a 1932 Tudor confection sandwiched between auto repair shops. His residence is on the top floor, and he rents out a luncheonette on the first. Mr. Ardizzone does not pine for the days before the auto shops, though. ''This is a busy and vibrant area, better for the economy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>About a year ago, Willets Point's reputation was a bit sullied after an undercover police operation that resulted in the arrest of Carmine Agnello, the son-in-law of John J. Gotti, the imprisoned head of the Gambino crime family.</p>
        <p>According to the police, Mr. Agnello insisted that undercover police officers posing as auto shop owners sell him crushed cars at very low prices. When the undercover officers refused, law enforcement officials said, he had his associates firebomb their business. Mr. Agnello was indicted and is free on bail. The police say that besides the shop owned by Mr. Agnello, there is one other shop linked to organized crime.</p>
        <p>In general, managers say they acquire parts from salvage yards and auctions. But some customers have wondered if they were buying back their own stolen car parts.</p>
        <p>Yet fans of Willets Point abound. Experienced customers know that they can haggle.</p>
        <p>Willie Villon, whose favorite shop is Mario's Auto Repair, drove his nine-year-old black Acura Integra from his home in Danbury, Conn., to the Willets Point shop one Saturday. He needed some engine work. Mr. Villon paid $1,600 for a job that he said would have cost $3,000 in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''They're cheaper here,'' said Mr. Villon, 17, who made the hour-and-a-half trek with his girlfriend, Loan Tran, also 17. ''They do a good job -- just as good as anywhere.''</p>
