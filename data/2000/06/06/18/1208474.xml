        <p>Syria's Baath Party, the structural support beneath the 30-year rule of the late Hafez al-Assad, gathered today to pledge allegiance to his 34-year-old son, Bashar, and to vest him formally with the political authority he had quietly exercised from the shadows in the last two years of his father's illness.</p>
        <p>Only the ceremonial start of the Baath congress was open to outside observers. But in the first few speeches lauding him, party delegates indicated they were ready to install Dr. Assad, an ophthalmologist by training, as a member of their national governing board and to endorse him for the job of president.</p>
        <p>The meeting of the more than 1,500 delegates is scheduled to last three days. Dr. Assad's nomination would then have to be ratified by the Parliament, which is overwhelmingly dominated by the Baath Party, and confirmed in a public referendum in which voters could say yes or no to his ascension to the presidency.</p>
        <p>The congress, the first in 15 years, was scheduled when the elder Mr. Assad was alive and intended to change his son's status from unofficial heir apparent to regent by giving him his first formal party and government titles. When Hafez al-Assad died a week ago, the party leadership moved quickly to convert the congress into a vehicle to ratify his son as successor. Dr. Assad, during a break in the proceedings, was mobbed by officials seeking to shake his hand and whisper congratulations in his ear.</p>
        <p>Although he has not held any official position, Dr. Assad does not enter the public spotlight unprepared. Diplomats, Syrian businessmen and analysts said he had already exercised considerable control over several foreign and domestic policy issues.</p>
        <p>Dr. Assad's internship as Syria's chief executive officer began with the forced retirement in July 1998 of his father's longtime aide, Hikmat Shehabi, the Syrian Army chief and first of many influential old-guard figures to be toppled or ruined by corruption allegations in the state-run press. Since then, Dr. Assad has quietly built a power base by courting the country's business elite, negotiating with foreign diplomats, installing allies in the military and intelligence hierarchy, changing two-thirds of the government ministers to his liking, and cultivating a public image of openness and probity.</p>
        <p>Syrian officials have gone to great pains to insist that Dr. Assad is the spontaneous choice of the public and the party. State-run television has shown almost nothing but Dr. Assad since his father's death, and the party distributed thousands of posters with his photograph on the eve of the funeral.</p>
        <p>''The late President Assad was very, very sick in the last two years, but not once did he say his son should be his successor,'' said Riyad Ghassan Agha, the chief of the presidential political bureau, in an interview on the Al-Jezeera satellite television channel. ''Now people have spoken,'' he added. ''Didn't you see all this support at the funeral for Bashar?''</p>
        <p>Diplomats in Damascus said the referendum on his presidency could offer an early sign of whether Dr. Assad's style of leadership would differ much from his father's secretive and authoritarian rule.</p>
        <p>''If they don't spend the billions they usually do to promote the single candidate, that will be a good sign,'' said a Western diplomat. ''The next sign we will be looking for is if he renovates the government. There are some ministers who have been there for 30 years.''</p>
        <p>As president-in-waiting, Dr. Assad has already had more intimate contact with the Syrian public than any previous modern leader by virtue of the Muslim mourning traditions. For four days last week he stood for hours in a receiving line in the village of Qardaha, where his father was buried, and shook the hands of tens of thousands of Syrians who came to offer condolences.</p>
        <p>Judging from those who have hovered close to his side and those he has placed in positions in the military and intelligence services, Dr. Assad may rely even more than his father on members of his Alawite sect. The Alawites, an offshoot of Shia Islam, are thought to represent about 10 percent of the Syrian population, but a far higher percentage of army and security officers.</p>
        <p>Dr. Assad has relied on Ali Aslan, the chief of staff who replaced the ousted General Shehabi; his brother-in-law Asef Showkat, who holds an important post that deals with promotions in the military intelligence branch; and Suleiman Bahgat, head of the domestic intelligence services. Dr. Assad has also been surrounded by friends of his own age from the politically privileged.</p>
        <p>In carefully screened interviews over the last few months, Dr. Assad has expressed interest in bringing Syria, where satellite television dishes are still officially illegal, into the modern information age. He has reassured entrepreneurs that he sympathizes with their complaints about bureaucrats who demand bribes, the absence of a private banking system and murky laws on investment.</p>
        <p>Dr. Assad would often summon people he wanted to consult to his office in the hills above Damascus, sending a limousine from the presidential protocol office to pick them up. One diplomat recalled that he once complained about corrupt government officials who kept delaying action on a foreign aid project. Dr. Assad, he said, interrupted briskly to say: ''I understand. You have the same problems I have.''</p>
        <p>But now that he is to assume public office, Dr. Assad may be limited in his ability to impose modernization on a hidebound one-party system that has run the nation's economy and social life for its own benefit.</p>
        <p>Dr. Assad will not make the dramatic changes that many Syrians may expect, predicted Imad Fawzi Shuebi, a Damascus University political scientist who said he is close to the Assad family. ''He is not in a hurry,'' Dr. Shuebi said, using a phrase often applied to Dr. Assad's father, who moved deliberately.</p>
        <p>In foreign policy, Dr. Assad's options may be especially limited.</p>
        <p>The consensus among diplomats and Syrian officials is that, as a matter of principle and political survival, he cannot be more flexible than his father on the substantive elements of peace negotiations. He will insist, they said, that every inch of the occupied Golan Heights must be returned by Israel to Syria.</p>
        <p>On the symbolic components of making peace, say some of Dr. Assad's acquaintances, he may be capable of bending.</p>
