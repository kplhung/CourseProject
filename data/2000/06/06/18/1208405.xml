        <p>Change is something Vice President Al Gore is not afraid of. Particularly when it involves his campaign.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the Gore 2000 machine underwent its second major overhaul in a year, with the departure of Tony Coelho as campaign chairman and the installation of William M. Daley, the commerce secretary, as his replacement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coelho, hospitalized on Monday with an inflamed colon, said his recurring condition was the reason for his leaving. But given the struggle of the Gore campaign in recent weeks to muster any momentum and slow the rise in the polls of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, many Democrats saw the changing of the guard as inevitable.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to miss a beat,'' Mr. Gore told reporters in Cincinnati. Still, the announcement diverted attention from the campaign's own efforts to reinvigorate itself. On Tuesday, Mr. Gore stood before supporters at the New York Historical Society in Manhattan to unveil his ''prosperity and progress tour,'' in which he is to crisscross the country, laying out his priorities for how the projected budget surpluses can be used to improve programs like Medicare and Social Security.</p>
        <p>The tour is intended to be a kind of memorandum to the country, reminding voters of what Mr. Gore's advisers believe is the winning message for the fall: that under the Clinton-Gore administration, the United States has experienced unparalleled economic success. (Indeed, in a commercial running in 17 states last week, the Republican National Committee began its pitch for Mr. Bush by conceding that the nation was ''more prosperous than ever.'')</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush took a respite from the road for much of the week at the family vacation compound in Kennebunkport, Me. The layover was a reminder of the closeness of the Bush clan. In written responses to a reporter's questions, Mr. Bush's father, the former president, acknowledged that he deeply felt each and every sling and arrow of the campaign as if it were his own.</p>
        <p>''I can tell you,'' he said, ''none of the flak I took affected me as much as when I see George unfairly criticized.''</p>
