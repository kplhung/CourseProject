        <p>A Little Rock trial lawyer and former Roman Catholic nun has been retained as special counsel by the Arkansas Supreme Court's Committee on Professional Conduct to handle its disbarment complaint against President Clinton.</p>
        <p>''I intend to represent the Committee to the very best of my ability,'' the lawyer, Marie B. Miller, said tonight. Ms. Miller said she expected that the papers arguing that the president be stripped of his law license would be filed in state court not later than July 1, but declined further comment.</p>
        <p>Ms. Miller, 48, is a Little Rock native who earned a law degree at the University of Kansas at Lawrence in 1984 while still a member of the Religious Sisters of Mercy in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>Last month, the legal committee recommended that Mr. Clinton's law license be revoked, citing what it said was his failure to testify truthfully in a deposition in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual harassment case. In his deposition, Mr. Clinton denied having had a sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, the former White House intern.</p>
        <p>The judge in the Jones case cited Mr. Clinton for contempt, fined him $90,000 and referred the matter of his testimony to the professional conduct committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has said that he intends to vigorously contest the disbarment action.</p>
