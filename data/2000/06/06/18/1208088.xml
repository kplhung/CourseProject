        <p>UNLIKE Brentwood, Bel Air and other swank western suburbs of Los Angeles, Santa Monica has a real downtown and a slew of restaurants, none of which, fortunately, is known for its stargazing. Some focus more on food than atmosphere, and some the other way around; a few succeed at both.</p>
        <p>Under the best of circumstances, this independent city is 20 minutes from downtown L.A. and Hollywood, though most residents would allow twice that time. Santa Monica's main attraction is its beach and famous pier, but there is also a vital group of art galleries (and a cafe) in Bergamot Station, a densely packed shopping district around Third Street that has not yet been  taken over by national chains, and a Wednesday and Saturday farmers' market that is among the nation's best.</p>

        <p>UNLIKE Brentwood, Bel Air and other swank western suburbs of Los Angeles, Santa Monica has a real downtown and a slew of restaurants, none of which, fortunately, is known for its stargazing. Some focus more on food than atmosphere, and some the other way around; a few succeed at both.</p>
        <p>Under the best of circumstances, this independent city is 20 minutes from downtown L.A. and Hollywood, though most residents would allow twice that time. Santa Monica's main attraction is its beach and famous pier, but there is also a vital group of art galleries (and a cafe) in Bergamot Station, a densely packed shopping district around Third Street that has not yet been  taken over by national chains, and a Wednesday and Saturday farmers' market that is among the nation's best.</p>
        <p>Then there are the restaurants, some nationally known. Michael's, which has a sister restaurant in midtown Manhattan, played a not insignificant role in bringing California cuisine to the attention of the rest of the country more than 20 years ago. Border Grill, whose owners are known as TV's ''Too Hot Tamales,'' introduced a high-quality version of Mexican food to an upscale audience. Across the street, La Serenata de Garibaldi transported the cuisine of the mainly Latino neighborhood of East L.A., where its owners have a restaurant of the same name, to this tony beach town.</p>
        <p>These all deserve credit, and Michael's remains a near must for visitors to Santa Monica. But the lesser-known restaurants are of greater interest these days, where the trend is toward simpler cooking, with local ingredients. This applies regardless of the style of food -- represented here are straight French, traditional Polish and food that might be labeled ''Cali-French,''  ''surfer-French,'' or ''original California.''</p>
        <p>JiRaffe</p>
        <p>Opened four years ago by Josiah Citrin and Raphael Lunetta, and now run by Mr. Lunetta (Mr. Citrin recently opened Melisse; see below), JiRaffe probably serves the best uncomplicated French-style food in metropolitan Los Angeles. It's not fussy, it's not pretentious and it's not even that expensive. The flavors are intense and seductive, making it very difficult not to overeat.</p>
        <p>On a nondescript corner in central Santa Monica, JiRaffe is warm and calm, set on two levels with soft lighting -- some of it from mismatched crystal chandeliers -- dark tongue-in-groove wood, lots of linen,  and heavy, dark furniture. You might  call it upscale faux French bistro, but  it's more pleasant than that.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lunetta's cooking sings with freshness. Salmon tartare, an overplayed dish if ever there was one, was good and spicy, served with a pureed asparagus sauce. Tomato and mozzarella tart, with its strong hit of basil, smacked of Provence. Similarly, braised rabbit with polenta squares featured tomato broth, basil, olives and onions. Halibut, baked in a crust, the top of which was removed at the table, was perfectly cooked -- again with asparagus, tomato and onion, this time along with mushrooms. The Provencal pattern continued with a nicely roasted sirloin served with mustard-tomato sauce, pesto, stuffed onion and braised celery with parsley. But rather than tiring of these flavors, I felt they were being used well in every dish.</p>
        <p>Two desserts were sensational: warm lemon curd souffle, served with lemon ice and raspberry sauce, was supertart, elegant and soothing. Counter that with a too-sweet but completely irresistible baked Alaska (why don't more restaurants do this?), a hard meringue sandwich with bright blueberry sorbet topped by vanilla ice cream and stiff Italian meringue.</p>
        <p>The nicely balanced wine list has some reasonably priced selections (and includes Cain Five, in my opinion one of the best red wines ever made in the United States, and an excellent match for this food), and the service is admirably efficient, even when JiRaffe is busy.</p>
        <p>Melisse</p>
        <p>Clearly, when Josiah Citrin left JiRaffe to open Melisse with his wife and partner, Diane Citrin, his intention was to add formality and elegance, and he has done so. Melisse is bustling, luxurious and stylishly ornate. I prefer restaurants that are toned down a notch, but you can't argue with success. And the food is dynamic if not always perfect.</p>
        <p>Clubby, with muted lighting, earth tones (especially olive), lots of wood, chandeliers, monogrammed plates and cushioned banquettes, Melisse is a serious restaurant, verging on the pretentious. In New York, you'd have to wear a tie to get into a place like this, but because of a tight schedule, I arrived wearing a T-shirt and jeans (albeit black ones) (albeit stained  black ones) and there was not even a hint of a problem. Some men wore suits, but others were dressed casually; the waiters were better dressed than any of us.</p>
        <p>Like the menu at JiRaffe, this one features ingredients that are perfectly seasonal: asparagus, basil, morels, beets, green garlic. Many combinations are far more ambitious. A starter of chilled, frothy cucumber soup with a spoonful of salmon tartare (did I say overplayed?) was good but a tad showy. Oeuf au caviare -- a soft-boiled egg yolk topped with savory truffle cream and caviar introduced a generation ago by Michel Guerard -- is fast becoming a signature in the country's best restaurants, and with good reason: it's terrific.</p>
        <p>Some dishes have problems; green pea soup with morels was overly peppery and even a bit sandy. Filet mignon was served with morels, a reduction of red wine and bearnaise, making me think Mr. Citrin needs to be told when to stop. Desserts were so over the top that perhaps I need mention only one: cappuccino creme brulee with tapioca, the kind of thing that gives California cuisine a bad name.</p>
        <p>Other dishes, however, were sensational: Green garlic soup with loads of clams; roast chicken, perfectly done and served on a glorious bed of peas and corn, with mashed potatoes containing real truffles, not truffle oil. Black bass with greens was simple and delicious, and came with a creamy crabcake.</p>
        <p>Here, too, the wine list was reasonable and appealing. A $40 Cotes de Beaunes Villages was round, fruity and delectable. Service was pleasant and not nearly as formal as you might imagine when you enter.</p>
        <p>In fact, much of Melisse belies its appearance. An ambitious meal is less than $100 a person with moderately priced wines.</p>
        <p>Warszawa</p>
        <p>I've never been east of Zurich, so I can't comment on Warszawa's authenticity. But this converted house -- with its chair rails, wainscoting, exposed beams, creaky wood floors, threadbare linens and shabby carpeting -- does convey a certain Old World atmosphere. But in any case, you are going for the food.</p>
        <p>Which is often wonderful, evidently authentic and very reasonably priced. Some items, like potato pancakes and potato pirogi, are standard, and well executed. Others, like pirogi filled with cheese, herbs and scallions, or with a variety of mushrooms, are more surprising.</p>
        <p>My favorite dish was an assortment of salads: carrot and a rather mild green sauerkraut; celeriac and walnut; a resoundingly fresh and rich rendition of cucumbers with sour cream and dill; pickled red cabbage with peppers and parsley; ripe, tasty tomatoes with scallion and goat cheese.</p>
        <p>Lest you think all the food was light, I also had a paprika-flavored tripe soup, a huge pork schnitzel and bigos, the classic hunter's stew, with bacon, pork, cabbage, sausage -- a kind of cassoulet without the beans.</p>
        <p>Although side dishes are uninspired, the basic menu here is nearly overwhelming because most of it is so appealing; I wish I could have eaten more. The wine list is weak, but a bottle of Taittinger at $55 will solve that problem for many people. The service is considerate if a tad harried. Desserts are good, too, especially the gorgeous vanilla crepe stuffed with lemon cream and served with raspberry sauce.</p>
        <p>Michael's</p>
        <p>If there is a more pleasant dining place in greater Los Angeles than the backyard at Michael's -- a converted house built in the 30's -- I don't know about it. You eat in the garden (the dining room isn't bad either, but it's clearly second best), with canvas umbrellas and an elaborate system of high canvas awnings. One can only guess at the cost of the landscaping, massed shrubs and flowers with small streams of water running over stones. It's a jungle, but an airy, shady and enchanting one.</p>
        <p>And most of the food keeps pace, as it has done since Michael McCarty opened the doors in 1979. Crabcakes -- served with crisp-sauteed corn, shallots, a spicy mayonnaise, and a violet garnish -- are as good as they get. Grilled-squid, grapefruit and arugula salad -- with arugula flowers, of course -- is refreshing, the squid tender and flavorful, the grapefruit juicy. The adventuresome pizzas (for one, mushrooms, sharp cheese and zucchini flowers) could be better executed -- the crust on one of mine was way underdone -- but are interesting without being silly.</p>
        <p>You cannot fault the execution on the beautifully grilled chicken, however, which is crisp and tender and comes with good fries. Duck confit with greens and root vegetable puree was also good.</p>
        <p>When you're as well-established as Michael's, it's hard to both keep an edge and satisfy the regulars, but that appears to be the case here. The service is nearly flawless, the wine list interesting (and the by-the-glass menu far better than most in California).</p>
        <p>Desserts are first-rate too: despite being sick to death of creme brulee, I ordered the Meyer-lemon version pushed on me by the server, and didn't regret it; it was creamy and tart. A glossy chocolate layer cake with chocolate mint ice cream was powerfully minty, but I liked it anyway.</p>
        <p>Chez Mimi</p>
        <p>Another Santa Monica restaurant where the garden is the place to be. The restaurant interior is soft and luxurious, but the brick-floored, wrought-iron-furnished, canvas-roofed garden is simply delightful.</p>
        <p>The simple, traditional bistro menu is well executed, too, and the service extremely professional. There are about 20 dinner appetizers, and it's hard to choose among them, not least because they're all familiar, ranging from pate to vichyssoise (nearly perfect) to snails to a filling, creamy mushroom salad.</p>
        <p>The entree menu is much the same: chicken with mustard, leg of lamb, trout with almonds. These are generally good, though a steak au poivre was badly overcooked (it was cheerfully and quickly replaced); liver was cooked rare as ordered, and served with good mashed potatoes that were not overwhelmed by butter as is the rage these days. Specials are appealing, too: the local sand dabs  were superb.</p>
        <p>I like the feel of Chez Mimi; the atmosphere is cheerful and upbeat.  The crowd is obviously mature, and while there is nothing hip about this place, it's comfy and treats you well.</p>
        <p>The Lobster</p>
        <p>It's a hyperglorified fried fish joint (although you can order lots more than fried fish), with food that is  inconsistent at best.</p>
        <p>Not that it matters: you go here for the view. The ocean, across the street, is glorious, with the Santa Monica pier jutting into it. And everything about this spare place is designed to take advantage of the site.</p>
        <p>A third of the tables are outside on an elevated terrace protected from wind and rain by plastic and glass, which can get pretty hot at midday but is ideal for watching the sun set. Many of the inside tables have good views as well. (Mirrors also reflect views of the ocean, a nice touch.) Inside, there are unfinished cement floors and columns, exposed beams and some tasteful fish paraphernalia. But, again, the view's the thing.</p>
        <p>That said, you can eat well here if you're careful -- and lucky. I recommend the hard-shell clams and mussels, which are steamed with applewood smoked bacon and fresh tomatoes. Crisp-fried squid is good, too, as are the fried oysters (unfortunately only three) served on a Caesar salad. I wish there were fresh Dungeness crab, one of the glories of the West Coast, but the restaurant's name relegates crab to a salad (not bad), and the menu features boiled Maine lobster instead. It's good, but it's better in Maine.</p>
        <p>Some of the food is downright weird, such as scallops with what amounts to barbecue sauce, and some of the simplest dishes -- fish and chips, for example -- are disappointing. The service is more than competent, however, and the wine list is very good. On a return visit, I'd order a glass of wine and some steamed mussels and clams, relax and enjoy the view.</p>
