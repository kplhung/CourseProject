        <p>Helen Paxton letter says finding an affordable first house (May 28 article) is not so hard if one is willing to live in an integrated community like Montclair, NJ</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read the article on finding an affordable home [''A Yearlong Search for That First House,'' May 28] with not a little cynicism. Having recently sold and bought a home in a town 15 miles from New York, I can report that if one is not prejudiced about neighborhoods (and has a like-minded real estate agent) good values in nice older homes are to be found, at least in Essex County, N.J.</p>
        <p>We moved from New York City to Montclair 13 years ago and bought a nice three-bedroom house with a lovely yard in a good neighborhood that is predominantly African-American (we are not). We recently sold this house for under $200,000, knowing full well that were it in a predominantly white neighborhood in our town it would have sold for at least $50,000 more.</p>

        <p>We now live in a beautiful five-bedroom Victorian, which we got for well under $300,000. It's on a lovely street in a neighborhood that is heavily interracial. There are house values for people with open minds about who their neighbors might be.</p>
