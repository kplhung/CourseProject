        <p>CONVENTIONAL wisdom holds that party platforms are only slightly less archaic than torchlight parades on election eve -- a grab bag of dogma for true believers at a time when nearly every candidate wants to run as a centrist, wooing the swing voters of the suburbs.</p>
        <p>But in fact, many experts say, national party platforms can be exceedingly revealing -- not only of what an administration will try to do once in office, but also of the power of various constituency groups and the extent to which a nominee is willing to take them on. In an era when everything else is so stage-managed and poll-driven in politics, platforms are where the activists -- like social conservatives in the Republican Party and organized labor, feminists and teachers in the Democratic -- often have their say.</p>
        <p>This, of course, can be troublesome for nominees, ever hopeful of a harmonious, triumphant convention for a middle-of-the-road audience. That may help explain why Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican nominee, and his fellow party leaders are not exactly throwing a spotlight on the platform process, which begins in earnest this week with two ''policy forums'' in Dayton, Ohio, and Billings, Mont. ''The less said about the platform the better, is their message,'' said Susan Cullman, co-chairwoman of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition, one of many groups trying to influence the document.</p>
        <p>Seemingly intent on avoiding the platform nightmares of Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican nominee, Mr. Bush signaled early on that he would not seek to contest the most contentious plank in the document: the call for an end to legalized abortion, with no exceptions for rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother. (Mr. Bush says he personally supports such exceptions.)</p>
        <p>Republican leaders in recent days have also indicated that there will be no public hearings on the abortion issue before the convention. At the same time, the Bush campaign is also distancing itself -- ever so respectfully and gingerly -- from the platform itself. ''The platform is a grass-roots document that percolates up from below and that reflects the views of the grass-roots activists of the party,'' said Ralph Reed, an adviser to the Bush campaign, adding that he believed this was true of both parties. ''And while that sets an overarching philosophical tone for the party, the nominees of the party at every level reserve the right to differ on particulars.''</p>
        <p>Anyone who thinks platforms are unimportant should consider their rough history. Sometimes, activists use them to ''constrain their candidate'' from breaking with party orthodoxy, as Paul Allen Beck, a political science professor at Ohio State University, put it. Most recently, social conservatives stopped Bob Dole from adding a tolerance provision to the abortion plank in 1996; he ended up metaphorically throwing up his hands, declaring that he had not even read the platform.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, the platform becomes another staging ground to continue a brutal primary struggle, a specialty of the Democrats for many years. In 1980, when Senator Edward M. Kennedy challenged President Jimmy Carter for the nomination, the two camps struggled over the platform for 17 hours of floor debate and numerous roll call votes; the Kennedy camp won so many liberal concessions -- like a demand for a $12 billion jobs program -- that Mr. Carter could not, in the end, fully endorse his own platform. In 1968, the battle between hawks and doves in the Democratic Party raged anew over the platform plank on Vietnam.</p>
        <p>For much of the 70's and 80's, the Democratic Party fought so hard over platforms, while losing so many elections, that its activists ultimately embraced a kind of realpolitik. By 1992, after 12 years out of power, Democrats approved a platform that was a model of centrist, New Democratic philosophy, organized around the unobjectionable themes of ''responsibility,'' ''opportunity'' and ''community.''</p>
        <p>''The message we wanted to deliver to the American people was, this wasn't the kind of Democratic Party you've been voting against for a quarter century,'' said Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, which was instrumental in the new platform. ''And the platform was a key element in that.''</p>
        <p>SO, for example, the party that in its 1972 platform railed against the evils of ''forced work requirements'' for welfare recipients was declaring in 1996 that welfare should be ''a second chance, not a way of life.'' Vice President Al Gore seems likely to follow suit thematically: the former editor of the leadership council's policy journal will be the main draftsman of the new Democratic platform.</p>
        <p>Alan Brinkley, a historian at Columbia who views the post-1992 Democratic platforms as ''bland to the point of invisibility,'' added, ''Even the most left-leaning members of the party have conceded they have to go with the game plan for everybody to get elected.''</p>
        <p>It is that mentality, of course, that the Bush campaign would like to foment in its party, after eight years out of power. Because another important truth about platforms, some analysts say, is that the only way average voters learn of a platform is when the opposition uses it against you. ''It is a document that can get you into trouble and can do you no good,'' said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster.</p>
        <p>The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, for example, intends to highlight the Republican platform's abortion position -- including its demand for the appointment of judges who respect ''the sanctity of innocent human life.'' Mr. Bush has declined to embrace such a litmus test. But his critics argue that if a candidate cannot override his party's constituent groups on the platform, he is unlikely to do so in office.</p>
        <p>In the end, for all the attempts to tamp down controversy in the platform, and for all the control modern nominees exert on the process, there is still room for the passion of activists. Mr. Beck, the political science professor, argues that in some ways, ''principles have become even more important'' for activists these days, because the old incentives for engagement -- like patronage -- have diminished.</p>
        <p>All of which explains why, even though abortion is nowhere on the agenda of this week's platform meetings, representatives of both the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition and local affiliates of the National Right to Life Committee are expected to head to Dayton and Billings.</p>
