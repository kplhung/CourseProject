        <p>IN New York City's sizzling real estate market, finding a house even for the Lord can be an exercise in frustration, disappointment, dashed hopes and, ultimately, compromise and ingenuity.</p>
        <p>Like everyone else on the trail of any sort of space -- house, apartment or office -- leaders of religious institutions have been confronting the tightest market in some time, compounded by the paucity of buildings that lend themselves, intact or through renovation, to the particular needs of worshipers. Finding land on which to build from the ground up is even more difficult.</p>
        <p>''It is a sobering process these days when real estate tycoons can sell multimillion-dollar properties in a half a day,'' said William Hibsher, a lawyer and co-chairman of the mishkan (Hebrew for sacred space) committee of Congregation Beth Simchat Torah, the gay and lesbian synagogue that has outgrown its quarters in the Westbeth complex and holds its Sabbath services at the Church of the Holy Apostles at Ninth Avenue and West 28th Street. ''Synagogues don't work like that. Most synagogues have no chief executive officer who dictates all decisions, and the congregation needs to vote. The period of time necessary to educate a congregation can be lengthy one.''</p>
        <p>''And,'' he added, ''if we had $15 million in the bank, we would shop at a different pace.''</p>
        <p>Making the decision to plunge into the real estate market, which can sometimes seem like a religion unto itself, is but the first small step along the road.</p>
        <p>The search for a home for the Bronx Christian Fellowship took four years. Congregation Or Zarua scoured the Upper East Side for two years to find quarters larger than the former church on East 82nd Street that it has occupied since 1994 before deciding it had no choice but to tear down and rebuild. The Mormon Church, whose policy it is to build communities of adherents first and then to take meeting houses to them, spent 15 months looking for a site in Harlem.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the Malcolm Shabazz Mosque in Harlem seems to have been immune to the struggle. It readily found space when it recently  embarked on a two-year-project to increase the size of its Clara Mohammed School and to open a foster-care center that will house not only  children but also families seeking to adopt them.</p>
        <p>Asked how difficult it had been to find land for those projects, the mosque's spiritual leader, Imam Izak-el M. Pasha, said, ''Harlem has had a history of unfortunate circumstances so there were plenty of vacant lots here.'' The school expansion will occupy property next door to the mosque on West 116th Street, the foster-care center will be on West 115th Street, and both will be physically linked to the house of worship.</p>
        <p>The timing was right: if the building and buying boom in Harlem continues at its current pace, vacant lots will be rarer and more costly.</p>
        <p>The ongoing search by East End Temple, a Reform Jewish congregation established 52 years ago to serve young families moving into places like Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, is more typical of what happens when religious institutions enter the real estate market.</p>
        <p>Until recently, the synagogue seemed poised to reap a handsome profit from the sale of four buildings its owned at the southeast corner of Second Avenue and 23rd Street: the temple itself and three adjacent 25-foot-wide mixed-use buildings -- stores on the ground floor with apartments above -- it had bought in 1957.</p>
        <p>Fifteen years ago, the temple had entered into an agreement with a developer to sell him the site, and in exchange, he would enfold a new synagogue in the resulting project, much in the way that St. Peter's Church was built as part of Citicorp Center at Lexington Avenue and 54th Street. But over time, one obstacle after another arose to impede the synagogue's plan, the most serious being the refusal of some rent-controlled tenants to move, no matter what the inducements.</p>
        <p>''When that deal fell apart, the temple was left burdened with debts, and the leadership went right to another developer who had expressed interest and tried to structure the same deal,'' recalled Rick Muskat, the chairman of the real estate committee. But two years ago that agreement, with a developer who planned to give the synagogue three or four floors at the base of an apartment tower, also collapsed.</p>
        <p>''We were left with places that were falling apart,'' said Helene Spring, the president of the temple for 15 years. ''There were leaks and repairs needed, difficulties with tenants, possible environmental problems and an easement for the prospective Second Avenue subway line. We didn't want to be in the real estate business, and it was costing us money we didn't have.''</p>
        <p>The synagogue's leadership listed the site with Massey Knakal Realty Services and received 28 offers, Mrs. Spring said. ''But none of them were willing to say we could move back there. Putting in a Gap or Duane Reade or whatever is worth more than a synagogue.''</p>
        <p>LAST August, the synagogue sold the property for $8.5 million to a company called 23rd Second Avenue L.L.C., which intends to erect a rental residential building there and has already demolished one of the three tenement buildings.</p>
        <p>The congregation moved out last July with no permanent home in sight. Members are determined to remain in the neighborhood, and they have set boundaries for the sites they will consider: 13th to 35th Streets between the East River and Park Avenue South.</p>
        <p>The synagogue has leased space in a former restaurant at 403 First Avenue between 23rd and 24th Streets and transformed the space into sanctuary, classrooms and offices. At the entrance on a base of wood and barbed wire stands one of the its most precious possessions: a Torah from  Czechoslovakia that had been desecrated by the Nazis but somehow rescued.</p>
        <p>After the move, the 12-member committee in charge of finding space began to re-evaluate their goals and analyze what had gone wrong.</p>
        <p>''My current plan is to develop a current plan,'' Mr. Muskat said, conceding the original blueprint was unrealistic, given budgetary constraints. The synagogue originally wanted 25,000 square feet with a sanctuary large enough to seat all members for the High Holy Days (for which it had always rented outside space), a social and dining hall for weddings and bar mitzvahs, a large kitchen, four religious-school classrooms, and a nursery school, library and youth lounge.</p>
        <p>''We had a grand vision, and it cost more than we could afford,'' Mr. Muskat said. ''We have been discussing what we want most, and what we are prepared to give up. If we can't have a sanctuary that expands to seat 500 for the High Holy Days, almost unanimously everyone said, 'Let's settle for a smaller sanctuary and have our High Holiday services elsewhere as we have always done.' ''</p>
        <p>''The other significant compromise,'' he continued, ''was to question whether we can really afford to have a nursery school. We are also prepared to reduce our needs for a banquet facility.''</p>
        <p>One option currently under consideration is a return to a site that was previously rejected. ''We had made an offer and gone to contract on a building on East 29th Street that was built to house a union office but never occupied,'' Mr. Muskat said. ''We didn't sign the contract because oil was found in an environmental search that would have brought a risk of exposure because we intended to demolish and reclaim the basement for use.''</p>
        <p>Now, he said, he is prepared to reconsider buying that building and leaving the basement untouched to reduce the risk.</p>
        <p>While some congregations seeking more or better space are forced to be patient, others face a greater urgency. Thanks to its steady growth, the elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have repeatedly faced the challenge of finding space. In 1990, there were 1,700 Mormons in Manhattan; this year, there are 3,400.</p>
        <p>''It is especially difficult in Manhattan,'' said Richard Hedberg, the church's real estate representative for the Northeast and parts of Canada. ''Land is so expensive, and everything has something on it. Typically, you have to buy something, tear it down and build it back up.''</p>
        <p>That is the plan for one of the church's  recent acquisitions, a single-story brick building at 56-58 West 129th Street it bought last year for $300,000 from the Central Harlem Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, which itself has moved on to 310 West 129th Street and rebuilt an existing Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall, doubling its size.</p>
        <p>Before acquiring the Jehovah's Witnesses' building, the Mormons had been conducting services at Sylvia's, the renowned soul-food restaurant (Sylvia Woods's son, Dan, is a church member).</p>
        <p>''We have a large number of members who live in the area, and we believe in taking the building to the members,'' said Brent Belnap, a vice president and senior counsel at Citibank who is the president of the Mormon church's Manhattan stake, a geographical area analogous to a diocese. ''It is a less than desirable building now,'' he said, ''but we are planning to build a temporary meeting house for four congregations on that site and on a vacant lot next door that we bought that together are 50 feet wide by 100 feet deep.''</p>
        <p>That plan, he explained, will be augmented by the addition of more space he hopes the church will acquire, either adjoining the existing lots or nearby. ''We have youth programs we feel will bless the lives of the people of Harlem in a major way,'' he said, ''from scouting to basketball, along with programs to strengthen the family and assist people in employment.''</p>
        <p>In March, the Mormons also opened a church on what had been vacant land at 1815 Riverside Drive in the Inwood section of northern Manhattan, a two-story, red-brick building with a chapel, 21 classrooms and a gymnasium that doubles as a cultural center. Two separate congregations or wards, as they are known in the church, meet there, one English-speaking, the other Spanish-speaking.</p>
        <p>In addition, the church is renting space in Chinatown, and plans are being considered to build a chapel downtown. ''We have also been actively searching for space for five years on the Upper East Side,'' Mr. Belnap said.</p>
        <p>He has sensed a shift in attitudes about real estate costs from Mormon headquarters in Salt Lake City.</p>
        <p>''It used to be that they were concerned about price,'' he said. ''Now they know if we want members on the Upper East Side, we must pay Manhattan prices -- and that would be multimillions of dollars.''</p>
        <p>The Rev. Dr. Suzan D. Johnson Cook had few preconceived notions when she embarked on the search for space for the Bronx Christian Fellowship, the Baptist church she founded with five members four years ago in a former bank across from the Bronx Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to attract black middle-class professionals, so it had to be clean, affordable and have suitable parking,'' she said, ''We were not relegated or locked into a building that had to look like a church, and we determined that we wanted more than a worship center, but a family life center, a community center as well.''</p>
        <p>AS a result, Dr. Johnson Cook said, ''We considered a number of warehouses, and we came very close to signing a deal on a catering hall in the Yankee Stadium area. But it had a restaurant, so we decided against it because either we would have had major renovation costs, or we would have had to keep it up as a restaurant.''</p>
        <p>''About 24 hours from signing that contract, I got two calls from the place we are now in, a beautiful stone building with a frame roof, almost in the shape of a cross, on a tree-lined street at 615 Reiss Place in the Pelham section of the Bronx,'' she said. ''It was formerly a Lutheran church, and then a Reform synagogue, and when my husband and I went inside, we knew immediately and offered them a binder. After that I took the congregation there. They sat in the sanctuary for an hour and said: 'Pastor, this is our church home. This is a holy space. We don't have to make it that.' ''</p>
        <p>Congregation Or Zarua had a similar experience in 1994 when it bought the First Waldensian Church of New York City on East 82nd Street.</p>
        <p>''When we did a search, we found a yahrzeit plaque in the basement,'' said Francine Klagsbrun, a writer and a founder of the  congregation, using the Hebrew word for memorial. ''It turned out that the church had begun as a synagogue in 1890.''</p>
        <p>Almost as soon as Or Zarua moved into the building, it became apparent that sooner or later, it would be necessary to renovate or tear it down and rebuild. That moment came two years later as membership grew, and office and classroom space had to be rented elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''We searched for two years for alternative opportunities,'' said Dr. Samuel C. Klagsbrun, Ms. Klagsbrun's husband, a psychiatrist, and a former president of the synagogue. ''Finding a place with built-in, sanctuary-like space was impossible. The ideal location for us would have been the old Lenox School on 70th Street, but the price was more than we could handle. We also looked at large basements of apartment buildings to see if any of them could be converted. Finally, when we realized there  was nothing we could afford, we turned back to our own building and redesigned it.''</p>
        <p>Delayed by the discovery of a huge granite rock beneath the building's foundation that had to be drilled out, preparations are now being made to pour the concrete. The new synagogue is expected to cost $7 million. While the old building was two stories tall, the new one will rise to seven and will have seating for 250 worshipers.</p>
        <p>Downtown, members of the Battery Park Synagogue, a Conservative congregation, don't even talk about buying or building. At one time, they even considered renting a kosher excursion boat but settled instead on a one-bedroom apartment at Gateway Plaza, an apartment building at Battery Park City. (For the High Holy Days, the congregation rents a hotel ballroom.)</p>
        <p>''We started the synagogue on virtually nothing but faith,'' said Mark Jaffe, a maritime lawyer and a trustee for 13 years. ''You must be creative and imaginative to take advantage of spaces that are already available and not used all the time. The cost of using it on a periodic basis is far less than having to maintain it on a permanent basis.'' The synagogue has an annual budget of $125,000 and recently hired its first rabbi,  Shoshana Dworsky.</p>
        <p>So far, it has been a happy tenancy. ''Neither the owners nor the tenants mind, and having a doorman increases our security,'' Mr. Jaffe said. ''In many ways, a stand-alone synagogue would be impractical for our area because of security, heating, air-conditioning and maintenance requirements.''</p>
        <p>But renting an apartment may not continue to be feasible as more people move into the area. Membership is growing by 20 percent a year, and there are now 200 dues-paying members. The Hebrew school, which conducts its classes in the apartment, has 60 students and a waiting list.</p>
        <p>''We are most likely to look at one of the office buildings in Battery Park City because they have generous floor spans,'' Mr. Jaffe said. ''Our plan now is to begin to raise an endowment to finance a lease so we won't have to build. If, for example, we pay about $300,000 a year for rent, we would need to raise an endowment of $4 million, which seems feasible.''</p>
        <p>''We are hoping our growth will come from people living in the Wall Street and TriBeCa areas,'' he said. ''To appreciate our synagogue, you have to appreciate the remarkable beauty of Battery Park City, where you enjoy the vistas and connect with the world outside the canyons of the city.''</p>
        <p>But to remain in that setting, he said,  ''requires people with vision -- and money.''</p>
