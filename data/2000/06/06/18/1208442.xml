        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>For Kyle Massey and Kerry Prichard, who lamented on the high cost and the inconvenience of repairman/ contractors (''Northern Hospitality,'' Soapbox, May 21), I have the following suggestion: Next time they should call a real problem solver, a New Jersey licensed architect who is a member of the A.I.A. The A.I.A. can provide them with a ''Beginner's Guide to Architectural Services.'' An architect is the one professional who has the education, training, experience and vision to guide the homeowner through the entire design and construction process. From helping you define what you want to build or repair to helping you get the most for your construction dollar, the architect will be your best investment if you turn to him or her first.</p>
