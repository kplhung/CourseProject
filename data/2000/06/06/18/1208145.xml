        <p>PAINTING and music are parallel arts; but as geometry teaches us, parallel lines do not intersect. That two immediate forms of expression should lead such separate lives is curious, given how many means and ends they share. Indeed, the musical reader goes through Jed Perl's interesting collection of art reviews for The New Republic (''Eyewitness'' from Basic Books) feeling spasms of recognition but also bewilderment at the unfamiliar cast of characters.</p>
        <p>In a city where entire cultures compress themselves into small, dense spaces, these two universes are at each other's fingertips. Music lovers on the way to the next ''Aida'' have only to blink, and suddenly noticed would be the galleries, studios, patrons and museums that lie along their path. Most art critics, I suspect, go to a few concerts, just as I go to a few art galleries. But our paths cross uneasily if at all. I can tell a Lucian Freud from an R. B. Kitaj, but so many of the artists Mr. Perl talks about I've never heard of. Maybe he doesn't know Thomas Ades or Wolfgang Rihm. (If he does, my apologies.) His is not my world and mine not his. Euclid was right.</p>

        <p>In a city where entire cultures compress themselves into small, dense spaces, these two universes are at each other's fingertips. Music lovers on the way to the next ''Aida'' have only to blink, and suddenly noticed would be the galleries, studios, patrons and museums that lie along their path. Most art critics, I suspect, go to a few concerts, just as I go to a few art galleries. But our paths cross uneasily if at all. I can tell a Lucian Freud from an R. B. Kitaj, but so many of the artists Mr. Perl talks about I've never heard of. Maybe he doesn't know Thomas Ades or Wolfgang Rihm. (If he does, my apologies.) His is not my world and mine not his. Euclid was right.</p>
        <p>The separation is not easy to figure out. Both mediums bypass words (or should). Both depend on direct contact between object and the applicable sense, be it eye or ear. Both begin with a fundamental urge -- indeed, a need -- to sort out the tangle of visions, sounds and emotions thrown at us by whatever it is that exists out there in front of us.</p>
        <p>One difference may be the idea of property. Certain art movements notwithstanding, a drawing or a painting is usually a thing, an object. The artist who made it owns it until he or she passes it on to a collector or a museum, and then that person or that institution owns it. Ownership is a source of pride and power. Music people wish they had it.</p>
        <p>Composers and their publishers own certain publication and performance rights, but even these are threatened by new technologies. Public domain does not apply to Rembrandt. Anyone can publish or play Chopin free of charge. A Pontormo is still worth millions every time it changes hands.</p>
        <p>Music lovers may own the skill and the history to parse every gesture of Schubert's G major Piano Sonata, but there is nothing they can hang on the wall and say is theirs. They may have bought the best recording and may proudly display it on the shelf, but so can everyone else. Maybe it is the zeal for possession that instigates all those deadly one-upsmanship debates among music people. The fact that they heard Birgit Nilsson do ''Tristan und Isolde'' in Vienna in 1960 and you didn't advertises an experience that they own and you don't.</p>
        <p>And there is, unfortunately, the matter of money, for art can make some artists and dealers a lot of it. An art market exists but not a classical-music one. John Harbison got a nice commission from the Metropolitan Opera for ''The Great Gatsby'' ($400,000 by one report). He might make a little more from performance rights or newly generated commissions, but music isn't going to make him or any other successful composer rich.</p>
        <p>One similarity: your local symphony, opera house and museum share the same culture of philanthropy, raising money either to buy new paintings or to make up for the inevitable box-office shortfall. Elsewhere, starving artists occupy most of the landscape, but big amounts of money float around their world. Art has its own economy, complete with hyperinflation, boom time and recession. Hardly anyone earns even a living at composing. (Perhaps Philip Glass; Ned Rorem may come close.)</p>
        <p>Then there is the experience itself: the point of contact between object and apprehender. Art and the art lover represent one on one (provided that you can escape the big-show mob scene). Hearing live performances is more of a chore. Music is the control freak of the two arts. People herd together into assigned seats, observe starting times, bow to rituals of behavior. Getting someone to hear a live performance of your music is a lot harder than hanging a picture in a public gallery with daily hours. If listeners want solitary contact, they buy a CD. It's like looking at an Abrams art book.</p>
        <p>COMPOSERS also have performers to get in their way. Musicians are retailers, receiving manufactured goods and passing them on to the public. I am sure that the frame, the lighting, the space and the placement can alter one's perception of a painting, but composers are perhaps even more at the mercy of their middlemen. Written scores are imperfect documents, filled with imprecise instructions and loopholes. The interpreter who thinks the right thoughts may not have the technique to make them known.</p>
        <p>In art and music criticism, a lot of the metaphors stay the same. Mr. Perl writes about rhythm in Gabriel Laderman's ''Dance of Death''; the music writer hears colors in Bartok. Touch gingerly on other similarities. Dada and the art of the non sequitur are probably as comfortable in painting as in a piano piece by Cage. Rauschenberg and Varese both purvey the found object. One could even equate the revival of realism after an era of abstract art with music's return to so-called neo-Romanticism.</p>
        <p>Positively uncanny is how 20th-century painting drifted from its pictorial moorings just as music began its brave adventure into atonality, serialism and an abandonment of what many people felt (and still feel) were music's natural laws. Art and music are separate mirrors that reflect some of the same things.</p>
