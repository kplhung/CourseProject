        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Please permit me to elaborate on one of the reasons for Westchester County's failure to achieve its affordable housing goal of 5,000 units in the last decade (''Addressing the County's No. 1 Need,'' May 14).</p>
        <p>When confronted with evidence that the astounding recent rise in housing prices would preclude many current Harrison residents from buying the houses they now own, the mayor based his opposition to cooperating with the county on his constituents' ''(mis)trust of the government'' and on their insistence that only those who can secure housing on their own should be allowed to live in the community. This conflicts with the mandate of the state's highest court that in its zoning every municipality must provide its share of the housing need of the region. The court's decision imposes an obligation on the municipality.</p>
