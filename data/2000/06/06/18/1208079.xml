        <p>Dreamland  By Kevin Baker. HarperTorch, $6.99.</p>
        <p>Set in lower Manhattan and Coney Island circa 1910, this wild novel is a stew of real-life and fictional gangsters, Tammany pols, labor reformers and carnival performers, all deployed in a sprawling plot that begins with the ill-advised rescue of a midget by a gangster named Kid Twist. '' 'Dreamland' is historical fiction at its most entertaining,'' Thomas Mallon said here in 1999.</p>
        <p>Annals of the Former World  By John McPhee. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $18.</p>
        <p>This Pulitzer Prize-winning opus about North America's rockscape pulls together the author's four previous books on geological history (focusing on the continent's dramatic eastern and western extremes) and a new essay on the Midwest. The result is an orderly march through deep time, exposing a lode of science and digressions. In 1998 our reviewer, David Quammen, found McPhee an overly cautious tour guide, but said, ''There are gemlike sentences, richly rhythmic paragraphs, nicely burnished synecdoches, metaphors as pungent as wasabi and, behind those felicities, vast amounts of painstaking research.''</p>
        <p>Who's Irish? Stories  By Gish Jen. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.</p>
        <p>The helter-skelter of the American immigrant experience is the subject of these tales, most of which revolve around cross-cultural skirmishes between an older generation of Chinese and their more assimilated children. ''Jen's gift is for comedy that resonates, and sadnesses that arise with perfect timing from absurdities,'' Jean Thompson wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>An Actor and His Time  By John Gielgud with John Miller and John Powell.  Applause, $16.95.</p>
        <p>In his modest memoir, the British actor, who died last month at 96, reveals his passion for the theatrical life while offering breezy portraits of T. S. Eliot, Edith Evans, Marlon Brando and others in his varied and eccentric supporting cast. ''He recounts his past with the same urbanity and sensitivity that have characterized his art,'' Frank Rich wrote here in 1980.</p>
        <p>Breath and Shadows  By Ella Leffland. Ballantine, $14.</p>
        <p>At the core of this melancholic novel about three generations of a well-to-do Danish clan is the question of what we lose in a lifetime, and what we leave behind to prove we existed. The result is ''an exquisite and moving family saga,'' Brooks Hansen wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>The Lustre of Our Country:  The American Experience of Religious Freedom  By John T. Noonan Jr. University of California, $17.95.</p>
        <p>A federal judge chronicles America's pursuit of religious freedom and the difficulties of reconciling faith and politics. In 1998 our reviewer, Richard Wightman Fox, called this a ''very enlightening tour through a complex legal and religious history.''</p>
        <p>Truth Comes in Blows: A Memoir  By Ted Solotaroff. Norton, $13.95.</p>
        <p>An editor and critic recalls his difficult childhood in prewar New Jersey and his struggle to understand his brutish father, the emperor of a plate-glass business and a malignant force in the lives of his family. ''For all its pain and sadness, 'Truth Comes in Blows' is as touching as gratitude and forgiveness, as exhilarating as truth,'' David Margolick wrote here in 1998. Fathers, Sons, and Brothers: The Men in My Family, by Bret Lott (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.95), is a collection of autobiographical essays exploring the complex emotions of being a son, sibling and father. ''Lott observes and beautifully renders those small moments that can change a life,'' Andrea Cooper said here in 1997. ''He captures the rough-and-tumble of men growing up.''</p>
        <p>Imani All Mine  By Connie Porter. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.</p>
        <p>Tasha is an unwed teenage mother in a Buffalo ghetto where her promise is frustrated by daunting obstacles, including her neglectful parents and teachers and her own poor self-image. Last year our reviewer, Andrea Higbie, called this a ''beautifully realized novel.'' The same publisher has reissued Porter's first novel, All-Bright COURT ($12), which traces two decades of life in a community of black steelworkers who migrated to upstate New York from the rural South in the 1960's. ''Porter conveys the truth of her characters' lives,'' Anne Whitehouse said here in 1991.</p>
        <p>Fleur de Leigh's Life of Crime  By Diane Leslie. Scribner, $12.</p>
        <p>The 10-year-old heroine of this first novel, failing to gain the attention of her glamorous show-biz parents in 1950's Hollywood, turns for love to a procession of oddball nannies. The result is ''a delicious and disturbing'' coming-of-age story, Nina Sonenberg said here in 1999.</p>
        <p>Writing New York: A Literary Anthology  Edited by Phillip Lopate.  Washington Square/Pocket Books, $22.95.</p>
        <p>This hymn to New York City marshals more than 100 voices spanning two centuries, from Washington Irving to Tom Wolfe, Edgar Allan Poe to Dawn Powell. Lopate's ''excellent anthology'' includes ''writers who love crowds and writers who hang out alone and brood,'' Garrison Keillor wrote here in 1998.</p>
