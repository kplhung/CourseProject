        <p>SCIENTISTS talk for a living. If this comes as a surprise, consider that all the experiments and deep thinking of scientific research take place in what amounts to a global sandbox overrun by extremely bright toddlers. Incessant communication is how they get their work done, and passing the secret of how to build the tallest sand castle to half a dozen of them -- say, those on one side of a line in the sand marked United States of America -- guarantees that the entire sandbox will look like downtown Manhattan in about five minutes.</p>
        <p>As secrets on nuclear terrorism and miniaturized warheads apparently slip out of Los Alamos National Laboratory and other federal labs, the message here would seem to be obvious: do not give dangerous secrets to scientists. There is, of course, a flaw in this solution. Governments need the scientists and their culture of openness to produce weapons that are worth keeping secret in the first place.</p>
        <p>That in a nutshell, is why science and secrecy have clashed, from the Renaissance to the Wen Ho Lee case.</p>
        <p>That clash, said Dr. Gerald Holton, a professor of physics and history of science at Harvard University, arises from an inherent contradiction between the ethos of science and what he called the obligation and absolute need for the preservation of national security.</p>
        <p>Science has served the powerful for centuries. When he was not changing the world with his painting and scientific investigations, Leonardo da Vinci moonlighted as a military engineer for Cesare Borgia, the ruthless model for Machiavelli's Prince. But the sting of secrecy apparently did not touch scientists until later in the Renaissance when Niccolo Tartaglia, the Italian mathematician who computed the first tables for firing cannons to specified distances, tried to impress a well-connected colleague in hopes of becoming artillery adviser to the Spanish Army.</p>
        <p>Around 1540, under a promise of strict secrecy, Tartaglia revealed how he had solved a famous problem called the cubic equation. Not only did he not get the job, but his colleague later published the solution. Tartaglia died an embittered pauper in Venice.</p>
        <p>Half a century later, Francis Bacon, the British philosopher of science, wrote that knowledge is power. He was right, but it was not until the 20th century and research on the atom that scientists, at any rate, were in a position to realize the full significance of his words.</p>
        <p>Secrecy, or at least a severe lack of communication, hampered the growth of science in Soviet times on both sides of the superpower conflict. In some cases, the problem was aesthetic. Speaking of top-flight Russian physics journals, Dr. Holton said, ''Whenever they arrived, you opened the first page and you saw this picture of Stalin on it. And you immediately closed the book.'' Partly as a result, the West vastly underestimated Soviet science until Sputnik was launched in October 1957.</p>
        <p>Soviet science suffered far more severely behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
        <p>Apparently hoping for quick improvements in crop yields, Stalin backed an  agronomist named Trofim Denisovich Lysenko, who favored a Lamarckian version of genetics. Lysenko thought that altering the surroundings in which plants grew could almost immediately create new species. His theories would have been laughed out of any open, international biology conference, but they managed to keep a stranglehold on Soviet science right through Khrushchev's regime, which ended in 1964.</p>
        <p>PROBABLY the defining science-versus-secrecy encounter was the battle between Gen. Leslie R. Groves, the director of the Manhattan project, which built the atomic bomb during World War II, and the scientists who actually designed the bomb and showed that it could work. That conflict, said Dr. Robert S. Norris, a historian at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, who is working on biography of Groves, was the template for all those that came after.</p>
        <p>Groves's bright idea of giving the scientists uniforms and military rank was stopped by a revolt led by I. I. Rabi, the street-smart New Yorker who soon received the Nobel Prize in physics. Groves also ordered scientists who were involved with different aspects of the bomb in Los Alamos, N.M., not to talk to each other about their work. J. Robert Oppenheimer (or Oppie, as his Manhattan project colleagues called him), the scientific director of the project, opposed Groves and won. The scientists kept talking.</p>
        <p>General Groves was a difficult boss who disliked scientists in general and Oppie in particular, wrote two veterans of the project, Dr. Hans Bethe of Cornell University and Dr. Robert Christy of Caltech, in a remembrance in the current issue of Physics Today. In the creation of the bomb, wrote Dr. Bethe (another Nobel laureate) and Dr. Christy, Oppenheimer's greatest contribution was his insistence on this freedom of communication inside the laboratory. (There are those who charge that Oppenheimer exercised that freedom of communication as a Soviet spy, but those accusations remain unproved.)</p>
        <p>The battle between scientific openness and the governmental vision of secrecy has continued in this same basic form up to the present, a case in point being the outrage among some scientists at the federal labs over polygraph testing and restrictive new security rules put in place after the recent investigation of Wen Ho Lee, a Los Alamos scientist suspected of spying for the Chinese.</p>
        <p>There have been lulls in the battle, as in the early 1990's when Hazel O'Leary, then secretary of energy, who declassified millions of previously secret documents and allowed some scientists at the federal labs to publish their most important research results for the first time. But some analysts later charged that this outpouring of information helped China to improve its nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>According to Dr. Sidney Drell, an emeritus professor at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and a member of a federal investigative panel that last year looked into security lapses at the labs, many scientists  feel fully capable of drawing and maintaining the line between classified and unclassified information in their minds. He blamed managerial ''casualness of habit'' rather than scientific volubility for the problems.</p>
        <p>But the clash between the sandbox and the bunker is unlikely to go away. Witness the footers added to e-mail messages sent out by Dr. Paul Ginsparg, a physicist who does non-weapons research at Los Alamos and who founded xxx.lanl.gov/, a thriving Web site where scientists from all over the world post their new work:</p>
        <p>''DISCLAIMER: No sensitive or classified information has been compromised by the creation of this document, and no foreign nationals from sensitive countries consulted during its composition have failed polygraph tests.''</p>
        <p>Somewhere, Oppie is smiling.</p>
