        <p>Your report on the demand by the Sagamore Rowing Association to remain at its site on Beekman Beach in Oyster Bay [''Young Rowers' Biggest Problem Is Ashore,'' June 4] may give readers the false impression that local and state authorities want to prevent young rowers from enjoying the sport so poetically described. The article is in fact an editorial supporting the association, while neglecting the background.</p>
        <p>While ospreys and swans may build their nests without government approval, a different situation arises for a private club using town property. Note some relevant facts:</p>
        <p>*From 1980 to 1996, the association was based in Huntington, and sought refuge in Oyster Bay after its Huntington site was sold.</p>
        <p>*The association's application to Oyster Bay asked only for placement of ''one trailer-type container'' at Beekman Beach, a town beach adjoining the former Jakobsen shipyard property that is now being renovated. ''Any building placed at Beekman Beach must be portable in nature,'' the town resolution stated. Instead, despite objections by residents, the association built a hideous steel Quonset hut 80 feet long.</p>
        <p>*The Town of Oyster Bay has repeatedly stated that permission to use the site was temporary. The association accepted this, and in fact told the Town Board the boathouse could be either at Beekman Beach or in the Western Waterfront.</p>
        <p>*No public hearing on permission to build the Quonset hut was held, despite a statutory requirement.</p>
        <p>The rowing association, which began by asking the town for a temporary facility, now pretends that it is not a temporary tenant. Instead of accepting the offer of space at the Western Waterfront or at a town beach in Bayville, this private club now concocts phoney safety issues.</p>
        <p>The reporter tells us that the dreams of students will be shattered by ''officials who say they do not have enough room in their plan to accommodate the growing number of rowers.'' This is hardly consistent with the fact that these officials have offered another building.</p>
        <p>True, the town may not consider it appropriate to have a facility large enough to serve all of western Long Island. (Many crews using the current site are not from Oyster Bay.) Does the commodore, Spencer Ross, expect the entire Western Waterfront to be dedicated to his club? Apparently so, since he proclaims, ''If we had more space, we could accommodate a lot more high schools and not exclude anyone.''</p>
        <p>Let the shells continue to glide on Oyster Bay, as long as the Sagamore Rowing Association doesn't try to dictate where the boats will be stored.</p>
        <p>CHARLES GAULKIN  Oyster Bay</p>
