        <p>Your Lives essay was interesting, but I was a little put off by the search-and-destroy tactics employed by these women. Certainly philandering men need to be held accountable for the pain they cause. But face it, the average guy is going to salivate, in response to an overtly seductive woman, regardless of the level of commitment in his personal relationships.</p>
