        <p>ALL our ancestors have gone abroad,'' wrote the poet Iain Crichton Smith who died at home in western Scotland in 1998:</p>
        <p>Their boots have other suns on them. They died</p>
        <p>In Canada and Africa with God,</p>
        <p>Their mouths tasting of exile and of spray.</p>
        <p>Some, with a good Scottish education, became the doctors, engineers and teachers of the North American continent. Others went with humbler skills: by the 1860's there were thousands of Scottish miners and stonecutters in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois, and their union leader was from the clan Macdonald. They could hardly have imagined that that name would one day become synonymous worldwide with an American life style.</p>
        <p>Others left their native land with no other baggage than desperation. These were the victims of the Highland clearances in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when absentee landlords chased tenants out of the hills and glens to create vast sheep runs. Today, the landscape is idyllically peaceful, and Highlands and Islands Enterprises, a regional development agency, encourages small farming and other local initiatives, but the brutality of the evictions is still alive in folk memory and in Gaelic laments.</p>
        <p>To make a pilgrimage to the heart of this territory, go to the far northwest, beyond the point where the Great Glen slices diagonally across Scotland from Fort William to Inverness. You have left behind the big towns of the Lowlands and the high mountains of the Grampians, with their royal connections round Balmoral, their excessive coating of evergreen plantations and their wall-to-wall tartan tourism. On the road out of Inverness, make for the Wester Ross region. Here you are still among mountains, but lower ones, with few trees either to soften or to mar their inexhaustibly changing contours and colors.</p>
        <p>Among the peat bogs, streams, lakes, wildflowers, ferns and bog cotton like fairy silk, there is a touch of the exotic about this landscape. And the Gulf Stream brings an extraordinary mildness to this region that, latitudinally, lies slightly to the north of Moscow.</p>
        <p>The hills sweep down into the ocean; the lochs twist and turn round hidden sandy bays, while at their mouths small islands rise and sink back into the ocean again with the changing skies. A little farther out the larger islands -- Lewis, the Uists, Skye -- float on the horizon, accessible by boat and, in the case of Skye, by a new and much debated road bridge.</p>
        <p>But you cannot do everything, and on a first trip to this magic part of the world it may be better to confine explorations to the mainland. You need time, anyway, to navigate the narrow, mainly coastal road (there is no choice) and the few side roads where, each time you meet another vehicle, one of you must pull over. Above all, you need time just to stop, look and enjoy some of the most beautiful scenery in the world.</p>
        <p>The metropolis of the area is Ullapool, a toy-size town of 1,500 where Loch Broom emerges into the sea. It was deliberately built 200-odd years ago, laid out as a herring-fishing station to employ some of the people ''cleared'' farther inland. It was also the port from which the first emigrant ship to Nova Scotia set sail in 1773. Today it is a center for walking, rock climbing, sailing and the ferry to Lewis; you can buy fishing tackle, or a Highland-knit jersey, or a book in a tiny but excellent bookshop attached to the Ceilidh Place restaurant. But even if you do not want any of these things it is worth pausing to visit the Ullapool Museum and Visitor Center, in a former Parliamentary Church, one of 32 built in the Highlands for the Established Church of Scotland before the split that created the Free Church in 1843. It closed in 1935, and after being lovingly restored, it reopened in 1988 as a museum and is a fine introduction to the region.</p>
        <p>You might first go north, over the border into the county of Sutherland where the new bridge over Loch Glencoul at Kylesku has opened up the coastal route to Thurso. (Before the bridge was built some 15 years ago, a ferry ran only in daylight hours.) A few miles beyond, on the headland at Scourie, is one of those little burial grounds overlooking the water that are typical of the area. This one contains the grave of a church clerk involved in the clearances: when he died in 1831, it is said, an evicted woman put a curse on him that he would not fit in his grave. Indeed that particular table grave never has settled down in the rocky soil; to this day it is the highest in the cemetery. Death, and the foretelling of death and the pyschic seeing of funeral processions, has long been a Highland preoccupation, one fed by the hellfire preachers of the Scottish churches.</p>
        <p>A boat trip takes one up Loch Glencoul, between its remote cliffs that are a haven for birds of many kinds. A waterfall (Eas Coul Aulin) thunders at its head, and on the way there and back you can usually get close to seals, basking on low islands with their young. When the mothers go out to sea to fish, the pups sometimes accost the boat with hopeful barks and occasionally have to be rescued and reared by a volunteer in Scourie if the mother does not return.</p>
        <p>Returning south again toward Ullapool,  the small switchback roads round the headlands of maximum scenic glory. By this route you will reach Lochinver, another tiny center with a few stores and a pleasant cafe-restaurant-bakery selling homemade pies. There is also a local factory, Highland Stoneware, that produces high-quality ovenproof pottery, handpainted with local seascapes and with the sheep, puffins, otters, fish, poppies and sunflowers that grace this region. The business was started 25 years ago by a local man, David Grant, who earned a degree as a ceramist at the Royal College of Art in London then returned to the Highlands to provide, with government help, some much-needed jobs. It and a secondary workshop in Ullapool now turn out 60,000 to 80,000 attractive pieces a year.</p>
        <p>Continuing on the small road round the next peninsula south, the scenery becomes even more spectacular. From the summit above deep, hidden Achnahaird Bay, the dreamlike Summer Isles appear on the far side: on a fine day they are like blue jewels, under shifting clouds they become a Japanese print in shades of gray, white and silver. The road peters out soon after the remote vacation beach at Alchiltibuie (walkers can continue), but another road winds back to the main highway past the shore of freshwater Loch Lurgainn below an impressive mountain, Stac Pollaidh.</p>
        <p>Traveling south from Ullapool, the road moves inland, past more spectacular waterfalls in the Gorge of Corrieshalloch, and then turns seaward again round the convoluted shores of Little Loch Broom, Gruinard Bay, Loch Ewe and finally to another small center at Gairloch. This section was built as a ''Destitution Road'' in the mid-19th century to provide work for the dispossessed and starving -- the potato famine struck here at the same time as it did in Ireland.</p>
        <p>However, the district has acquired a memorable place in more recent history. In World War II a joint force of British and American ships convoyed war materials across the North Atlantic to the Soviet allies in Archangel and Murmansk, and Loch Ewe was where the ships and their crews lay up between expeditions. In those same years, lovely Gruinard Island became a testing ground for the deadly biological weapon anthrax.</p>
        <p>Today, Gruinard is cleansed and once again sheep graze there on the summer grass. It is hard to imagine, in this landscape empty of all but scattered communities of small farms, the time when military and naval personnel far outnumbered local people and the few hotels and village halls in the area became hospitals and canteens. Because the whole operation was top secret, few personal accounts were kept at the time. But now that the survivors are old, and have been coming back in increasing numbers to revisit the scenes of their youth, efforts are being made to record and commemorate their adventures. The Pool House Hotel, at the head of the loch at Poolewe, was the intelligence headquarters and the officers' club: it has received many former G.I.'s in recent years, and a permanent museum is due to open next year.</p>
        <p>But there is another reason for visiting Poolewe. At an earlier date, Pool House was home to Osgood Mackenzie, the man who laid out the famous Inverewe Garden just to the north. In 1862 he inherited a wind-swept, treeless waste on the side of the loch, and in 20 years, by sheer persistence, earth shifting by the local poor (who carried tons of it in little baskets on their backs) and careful planting, he had a thriving woodland garden there. Though he was in some ways a ferocious hunting-shooting laird of the old school, Mackenzie was also a traveled man and planted decorative trees and plants from all over the world. In specially created sheltered spots, Mediterranean species and even palm trees flourish, and delicate fuchsias and azaleas, as well as towering rhododendrons from the Himalayas, make the place a joy. Despite a few mixed borders, this is not a flower garden, but a plant collection with a splendid junglelike feeling where one can walk for over an hour without covering the same territory.</p>
        <p>After Gairloch the road continues inland along Loch Maree to Kinlochewe and then to Torridon, round the edge of the splendidly mountainous Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve. Queen Victoria stayed at the Loch Maree Hotel with the gillie John Brown at her elbow; it was a time when she could wander about and talk to the occasional cottager without the attention such a royal excursion would attract today. A particularly lovely waterfall in woods nearby bears her name.</p>
        <p>After the crossroads at Kinlochewe -- a few bed-and-breakfast cottages, a cafe, a vital gas station -- you are entering another area of unspoiled remoteness. Victoria said of the ancient red sandstone Torridon Highlands and the Pass of the Winds toward Diabaig on the north side of Loch Torridon, ''No one ever comes here,'' and it is still almost true. Torridon village, at the head of the loch, is a cluster of fishermen's cottages and is a little oasis in its own right: it has managed to keep its school open and there is a general store run by a Macdonald who is a Gaelic speaker and will sell you a book or two about the American connection.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, on this beautiful sheltered loch, there is only a grand country-house hotel (established in the former shooting lodge of a 19th-century Lord Lovelace) and another of those little cemeteries by the water. This one is just along the road from the village near a few cottages -- hardly even a hamlet -- called Annat, on a narrow shoreline strip where some people were allowed to settle after they had lost their lands elsewhere. Many of the stones in the older of the two burial grounds were erected by those who had emigrated but wanted to make a gesture of respect to bygone days.</p>
        <p>Some also name those who lie elsewhere -- in Edinburgh or Glasgow or London or much farther afield. A John Mackenzie died ''in Victoria, BC, Canada,'' and another of the same name, a lovingly remembered blacksmith, ''died of sunstroke at Cincinnati, Ohio, USA on the 17th July 1887, aged 26 years,'' interred there in Spring Grove Cemetery. Growing up in Torridon he would hardly have learned to dread the sun. It is rather the deceptively quiet loch, with its liability to sudden storms, that has claimed local lives: several stones commemorating drowned fishermen sink gently into the spongy peat.</p>
        <p>There is one more delightful excursion before heading farther south to the relatively populated area around the bridge to Skye. A side road two miles from Torridon at Shieldaig has, since the mid 1970's, run round the edge of the peninsula to the tiny settlement at Applecross -- a campsite, a few cottages, a tearoom in a tunnel of flowers, one inn from which you can enjoy a wonderfully lingering sunset out over the Isle of Raasay. Nothing to do with apples: the Gaelic A'Chomraich means a sanctuary, for this is the site of one of the oldest Celtic churches in the world, founded in the seventh century by an Irish saint, Maelrubha.</p>
        <p>As an alternative route there, you can take the high road over the top, Bealach na Ba, the Pass of the Cattle, which is what it was for centuries before it was made (just about) manageable by car. It is said to be the steepest road in Britain and provides  views of Alpine grandeur. Signs at the foot warn you not to attempt it in winter; I would absolutely not recommend it in the rain (you wouldn't see the views anyway). Otherwise, it is unmissable.</p>
        <p>A guide to loch-hopping</p>
        <p>The best period to visit northwest Scotland is mid-April to mid-October, with a better chance of bright, dry weather toward the later part of the season.</p>
        <p>Unless you plan a leisurely walkers' stay, a car is essential. A pleasant alternative is to take the sleeper from Euston Station  in London, arriving at Inverness the next morning. Book well ahead with ScotRail, (44-845) 755-0033, and the round trip is $166 (at $1.50 to a pound), with a coffee-and-croissant breakfast in your two-berth cabin.</p>
        <p>Inverness has branches of international car-rental agencies. A cheaper, adequate alternative is Sharp's Reliable Wrecks, Highland Rail House on the station square; (44-1463) 236684, fax (44-1463) 713777.</p>
        <p>Accommodations</p>
        <p>The region is free of mass tourism, and free of motels. The few good hotels are widely scattered; the best are booked up in season. The many bed-and-breakfasts (some remote) charge $18 to $53 a person a night;  the cooked breakfast is usually very ample.</p>
        <p>For real luxury, the Loch Torridon Country House Hotel, (44-1445) 791242, fax (44-1445) 791296, provides antiques in the bedrooms and excellent food. Nightly rates run from $137 for a single room with breakfast to $395 for a double suite ($508 with dinner) June through September.</p>
        <p>The same company runs the more modest  Ben Damph Lodge (same telephone and fax) with rooms in the former stable block of the Loch Torridon Country House accommodating families for under $106 a night and a modestly priced restaurant.</p>
        <p>For character, food, welcoming staff and views, I like the Pool House Hotel at Poolewe; a room with breakfast and dinner  starts at $68 a person, up to $190 for a suite; (44-1445) 781272, fax (44-1445) 781403.</p>
        <p>The Old Mill Highland Lodge at Talladale on Loch Maree, (44-1445) 760271, is run more like a private house by a married couple who produce delicious food, with wine to match. Rooms with breakfast and dinner are about $91 a person.</p>
        <p>Dining</p>
        <p>There are a few excellent small places, imaginative and informal, including the Ceilidh Place in Ullapool (vegetarian specialties in a clublike atmosphere), which is also a hotel; (44-1854) 612103.</p>
        <p>The Kylesku Hotel, the old ferry inn by Loch Glencoul, has good, unpretentious food. From here, the Statesman sails twice daily on two-hour sightseeing cruises ($15).</p>
        <p>In isolated Lochinvar, the Lochinvar Larder provides celebrated bistro food: venison pies ($4.35 to go) and mackerel pate ($6.85 a serving); (44-1571) 844356.</p>
        <p>The Altnaharrie Inn, Ullapool, (44-1854) 633230, fax (44-1854) 633303, has earned two Michelin stars for its restaurant, usually filled by guests at the inn. Rates per person for room, breakfast and dinner are $249 to $309. The inn, reached by ferry from Ullapool, is open from Easter to Oct. 31.</p>
