        <p>On a picturesque morning that Payne Stewart would have loved, many of his peers and friends gathered to honor him on the 18th hole at Pebble Beach.</p>
        <p>Stewart, last year's United States Open champion, was killed in an October plane crash. He was one of the most outgoing players on tour, and the half-hour memorial service was attended by many players in this week's field. His widow, Tracey Stewart, spoke, as did his close friend, Paul Azinger.</p>
        <p>At the end of the service, there was a poignant moment when 20 players and his caddie, Mike Hicks, faced the Pacific Ocean and simultaneously hit golf balls into the water.</p>
        <p>''Every time I've been to a tribute to Payne, it gets tougher,'' said Hal Sutton, who played on last year's Ryder Cup team with Stewart. ''I spent 18 years out here on tour with Payne Stewart. That doesn't go away over night. A lot of times we'd have lockers next to each other, because they were assigned in alphabetical order. I still find myself looking over next to me in the locker room, thinking he should be there.</p>
        <p>''I was sitting here thinking about how beautiful this is, and he has missed the opportunity to be present and be the defending champion. As beautiful as all that was today, that void is still in Tracey's life. I think we'll always miss him.''</p>
        <p>Sore Back for Sutton</p>
        <p>Hal Sutton is suffering from a sore back, which may hamper his play. He walked off the course Tuesday after practicing just one hole.</p>
        <p>''I was just hitting balls yesterday morning early and I felt a catch in my back,'' Sutton said today. ''It hurt pretty bad. I tried to play one hole, and I thought rather than push this, I'm not going to try. So I didn't play.''</p>
        <p>Sutton, however, cautioned it would be unwise to count him out. ''I only played nine holes of practice at The Players Championship,'' said Sutton, referring to the tournament he won in March. ''Practice rounds are not everything.''</p>
        <p>Montgomerie Feels Pressure</p>
        <p>Colin Montgomerie, ranked No. 3 in the world, admitted there was extra pressure on him, not having won a major yet at age 36.</p>
        <p>''I've had a reasonable career and haven't won a major, so yes, there's slightly more pressure,'' Montgomerie said. ''I would like to do it, but if I don't, I've had a good run.''</p>
        <p>Montgomerie said that if he never wins a major, the round he would regret most was Friday at the 1997 United States Open at Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Md. After leading the tournament with an opening-round 65, Montgomerie shot 76 the next day. He followed with a 67 on Saturday and a 69 Sunday, but finished second to Ernie Els.</p>
        <p>''The score I had the first, third and fourth days are plenty to win a U.S. Open,'' Montgomerie said. ''But I had played the previous week in England, and jet lag hit me Friday afternoon. That's why I've had a week off coming in here. I've tried to counter that mistake I made in '97.''</p>
