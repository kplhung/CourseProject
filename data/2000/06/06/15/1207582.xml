        <p>What had begun as a novel idea -- bringing men's senior professional tennis to Central Park -- seemed to be sinking into quicksand yesterday.</p>
        <p>It was not until 8:20 p.m., when Jimmy Connors, the founder of this senior circuit in 1993, rescued the Masters championship last night by playing the first match in a tournament delayed by more than a day and a half of intermittent rain.</p>
        <p>Connors finally kicked off the eight-man round-robin tournament on the waterlogged Har-Tru clay court built over the flat cement of Wollman Rink, a surface that was more sandbox than tennis court.</p>
        <p>He slogged through his match against the Ecuadorian Andres Gomez, punctuating his cross-court backhands with a running commentary in his first return to New York City since his remarkable run to the semifinals of the United States Open in 1991. ''I'm too old to be bending this low,'' the 41-year-old Connors shouted, panting.</p>
        <p>Both players realized that the ball died quickly on the wet clay, almost as quickly as their legs from running after drop shots and bending at the baseline. Connors was able to outlast Gomez,  6-2, 7-6 (4) in front of about 2,400 fans in the makeshift stands built for 2,953.</p>
        <p>''It was like playing on puddles of water -- terrible,'' Connors said afterward. ''If it was 20 years ago, would I have done it? I doubt it. But it's tough, the fans wanted to see these matches.''</p>
        <p>John McEnroe followed Connors in the second match, defeating Mansour Bahrami, 6-3, 6-4, and had the same frustrated assessment.</p>
        <p>''It's bad,'' McEnroe said. ''You look forward to playing in Central Park and it was embarrassing.''</p>
        <p>Crews had worked since Tuesday with industrial dryers and a tarp; they used towels as sponges and replaced the clay. Their efforts were not successful by yesterday afternoon, as Bjorn Borg's meeting against his fellow Swede Mats Wilander became the first match postponed.</p>
        <p>After eight years on the senior tour, Borg, 44, said that this would be his last event in the United States and that he would retire -- for the third time in his career -- next year to help develop junior tennis in Sweden.</p>
        <p>Borg, the 11-time Grand Slam winner, would have to wait another day to play on what is usually his favorite surface. He will face Gomez at 1 p.m. today.</p>
