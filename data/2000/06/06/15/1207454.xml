        <p>IT is an axiom in the publishing business that when a demographic group is ready, its magazine will appear. It happened with Rolling Stone, it happened with Maxim, it happened with Bassmaster and Jane, and now it is happening with Dads. For the first time in history, a lifestyle magazine aimed exclusively at men who are parents -- that is, men whose male, non-gender-neutral parenthood techniques form an integral component of their personalities -- has arrived. The only question to ask Dads Media L.L.C., the publisher, is, what took you so long?</p>
        <p>Without a doubt, the introduction of the magazine is timely. A Harris Interactive poll conducted for the Radcliffe Public Policy Center finds that a startling number of young men now view family as more important than money, power or prestige. In the poll of 1,000 men and women, 70 percent of men 20 to 29 were willing to surrender pay to spend more time with their children, compared with 63 percent of women in the same age group. And 54 percent of the men in the sample said that if they had one extra hour a day, they would spend it with their families, with only 6 percent reporting that they would spend it on work. In other words, given 60 extra minutes a day, a majority of fathers would spend even more time being dads.</p>

        <p>IT is an axiom in the publishing business that when a demographic group is ready, its magazine will appear. It happened with Rolling Stone, it happened with Maxim, it happened with Bassmaster and Jane, and now it is happening with Dads. For the first time in history, a lifestyle magazine aimed exclusively at men who are parents -- that is, men whose male, non-gender-neutral parenthood techniques form an integral component of their personalities -- has arrived. The only question to ask Dads Media L.L.C., the publisher, is, what took you so long?</p>
        <p>Without a doubt, the introduction of the magazine is timely. A Harris Interactive poll conducted for the Radcliffe Public Policy Center finds that a startling number of young men now view family as more important than money, power or prestige. In the poll of 1,000 men and women, 70 percent of men 20 to 29 were willing to surrender pay to spend more time with their children, compared with 63 percent of women in the same age group. And 54 percent of the men in the sample said that if they had one extra hour a day, they would spend it with their families, with only 6 percent reporting that they would spend it on work. In other words, given 60 extra minutes a day, a majority of fathers would spend even more time being dads.</p>
        <p>Clearly, the decision to name this magazine Dads was not taken lightly. Traditionally, the word ''dads'' has fallen into the same general area as ''chums,'' ''pals,'' ''buddies'' and ''hubbies'': an affectionate yet generic term, which, while suffused with unambiguous good will, seems imbued with a chiding, satiric undertone, suggesting that the person to whom it is applied has somehow been domesticated, subdued, defanged.</p>
        <p>In earlier times in American history, when men were more aloof and carnivorous and usually couldn't stand their children, something more deferential such as Fathers magazine or Working Patriarch or Today's Old Man or even American Coot would have fitted better.</p>
        <p>But now that dads have enthusiastically embraced their role as fathers and nurturers, the term ''dads'' has been stripped of its Ozzie Nelsonish pallidness. While retaining a forcefully inoffensive quality, the term ''dads'' is now almost a badge of honor, a bold proclamation that it is still possible to be a really cool, really happening guy long after one's studmuffinly days have ended. Had Dads Media L.L.C. chosen Pops, Geezers, Pappies, Papas or Daddy-o's as its title, this claim could probably not be made.</p>
        <p>''Dads was our one single best idea,'' explained Eric Garland, Dads' editor and co-founder, previously editorial director at Adweek and executive editor at Brill's Content. ''It's the most accessible, friendly and engaging term. It's what we're called by our children. It also says specifically what we are and who we are. It is not a gender-neutral term.''</p>
        <p>As befits a magazine aimed at men between 25 and 54 who have children younger than 18, the cover of Dads' premiere issue is given over to Cal Ripken Jr., the Baltimore Orioles superstar. This was an inspired choice, as Mr. Ripken is an appropriate symbol for most American dads today: slightly over the hill but still breathing. Inside, the magazine quickly identifies itself as being antiviolence, antisexist, antiracist, pro-carpentry. Throughout, it is replete with the kinds of essential, postmodern-man material that can be found in no other magazine. For example, in an article explaining how dads can persuade their sons to tell them where the firearms are concealed at their schools, James C. McKinley Jr. writes:</p>
        <p>''One solution, says Russ Skiba, a psychologist at Indiana University, is to make a clear distinction early on between reporting something merely to get a child in trouble and telling an adult when someone might be killed or injured.''</p>
        <p>An obvious solution perhaps, yet before I read this article it had never occurred to me to use an argument of such byzantine subtlety when discussing middle school weaponry with my own 13-year-old boy.</p>
        <p>Dads is nothing if not service-oriented. One article explains how dads can keep their kids amused on a rainy day by going on a nature walk or constructing a Styrofoam boat. News dads can use. A second article explains that being silent, stoic and remote ''is a potential disaster for today's youth,'' even though it seems to have worked for George Washington and Buddha and, for that matter, God. And a third article explains how to use dad's old workshop to ''sand down the old silences'' between generations. Presumably, future issues will revisit dad's old workshop to hammer out agreements and nail down plans.</p>
        <p>From the very first page, it is clear that Dads is not a magazine for the Greatest Generation, because even though the dads of the baby boomers saved Western civilization from the satanic forces of totalitarianism, they smoked and drank too much and were too fond of guns and were thus not really ''dads'' in the sense that Dads thinks of dads. They were more like ''dudes'' or even ''men.''</p>
        <p>Since Dads derives from the unspoken but incontestable belief that today's fathers are better fathers than their own fathers, it will be interesting to see how future issues of the magazine deal with the subject of dads and their dads. Perhaps Dads will do what dads have always done when dealing with wrenching emotional issues: ignore them.</p>
        <p>Frankly, my only reservation about Dads is concern about maintaining the high level of quality demonstrated in its maiden issue. Having already covered woodworking, barbecuing, firearms, cars, money and oral sex, Dads has exhausted most of the editorial interests of the average American male. It will be fascinating to see how a magazine as iconoclastic as Dads deals with this problem.</p>
        <p>It will also be interesting to see whether the success of Dads begets such kindred publications as Cousins, Nephews and Uncs or branches out into even broader markets such as Guys, Chaps and Fellas. This in turn would pave the way for broad-based niche publications like Senior Hepcat, Slacker Dads and perhaps even a Latino-oriented magazine, Padres. As for women's magazines, right now, Mums is not the word.</p>
