        <p>DESPITE all the advances in digital photography and the rise in Web-based photo album services, sharing pictures is easier when the images are on paper. As long as the photographs are stored on the hard disks of their computers, they will be accessible only to friends and relatives who can gather around the computer screen.</p>
        <p>Several Internet-based photo printing companies have focused on this problem. Shutterfly and Ofoto are two of the better-known examples. They promise to make it easy to get professional-quality prints of digital images without the expense and hassle of setting up a color photo printer at home.

        <p>DESPITE all the advances in digital photography and the rise in Web-based photo album services, sharing pictures is easier when the images are on paper. As long as the photographs are stored on the hard disks of their computers, they will be accessible only to friends and relatives who can gather around the computer screen.</p>
        <p>Several Internet-based photo printing companies have focused on this problem. Shutterfly and Ofoto are two of the better-known examples. They promise to make it easy to get professional-quality prints of digital images without the expense and hassle of setting up a color photo printer at home. The user uploads a digital image and some money to one of these companies and receives a high-quality print in the mail.</p>
        <p>But part of the allure of digital photography is instant gratification, and the ''some day my prints will come'' services can be frustrating, even if the delay is only a day or two. Seeking snappier results, I went looking for a color inkjet printer capable of producing photo-quality prints from my desktop in a few minutes. It also had to crank out sharp text documents, which account for most of my day-to-day printing.</p>
        <p>Dozens of inkjet printers now boast about photo-quality printing. Some are built solely for printing photographs but do a lousy job on text. Others are fine for text but spit out mottled pictures only a mother could love. I tested three contenders ranging in street price from $200 to $500, and was surprised at how well each performed.</p>
        <p>The low-cost (list price $230) Epson Stylus 760 is a bargain, with surprisingly high quality when used with expensive, premium photo paper.</p>
        <p>The mid-range Canon BJC-8200 ($399) does even better with special paper, and it has some clever features that make it particularly easy to use.</p>
        <p>At the high end, the brawny Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 1220C ($499) has the best photo and text quality of the three, and it also has the largest paper format, for those magical shots that demand to be bigger than 8 by 10. Keep in mind, however, that the price of the printer is just the start.</p>
        <p>To get the best results, one must use premium photographic paper, and it is expensive -- typically 50 cents to 75 cents per sheet, and as much as $2 for the really good stuff. And color photographs guzzle ink. The ink cartridges used by these printers are also expensive, typically $15 to $30.</p>
        <p>Depending on the size of the photos, the quality of the paper and other factors, the average cost per print can easily top $1.</p>
        <p>That is undoubtedly a good thing, at least for friends of the photographer, because it forces shutterbugs to be selective. At $1 a pop, variations of ''this is me sitting in the airport'' become much less interesting.</p>
        <p>The durability of the prints is also an issue. Photographic prints made with conventional chemical processing (the kind you get from the drugstore or from one of the online services like Shutterfly) can be expected to remain colorfast and to resist fading for years, if not several decades. But prints made on a typical desktop inkjet printer will almost certainly fade in a few years, or mere months if left in bright light.</p>
        <p>Epson recently announced a new ''archival'' ink formula for some of its inkjet printers. The company says the ink will resist fading for several lifetimes, as long as 200 years even under fluorescent lighting. Testing that claim will be difficult, but it shows that researchers are working to improve longevity.</p>
        <p>The various printer manufacturers all have tricks they use to improve the sharpness, or resolution, of the prints. They measure resolution in dots per inch, and in general the higher the numbers, the sharper the prints are likely to be. The best way to verify the claims of photo-quality printing, however, is to see a sample of the output on photo paper.</p>
        <p>Each of the three printers I tested produced prints that on casual examination were nearly equal to drugstore prints. The images I printed were taken with a Nikon Coolpix 990 digital camera at its highest, three-megapixel, setting and tweaked with Adobe Photoshop. The printers were set to their maximum performance settings and loaded with each company's recommended premium paper. The printers were also tested with plain paper.</p>
        <p>The Epson Stylus Color 760 was the least expensive, and it trailed the others in expected ways, like print speed. Epson says the printer can  spit out an 8-by-10 photo in less than two minutes, which is true at lower resolutions. But in my tests, at maximum resolution, it took more than seven minutes. The printer was fairly quiet but shook the table a bit.</p>
        <p>But the Epson excelled in unexpected ways, like print quality. Although it did not match the Canon or HP printers, the prints were remarkably vivid on glossy photo paper and very impressive on plain paper. Epson claims a maximum resolution of 1,440-by-720 dots per inch, which is superior to other printers in its price range. One key to its impressive performance is the tiny (four-picoliter) size of the ink drops it sprays.</p>
        <p>The Epson was also refreshingly simple to set up, with a choice of either parallel or U.S.B. connections. It works with Windows and Macintosh, but Mac users may find its boxy  beige design to be drab. But the design is the only thing drab about it.</p>
        <p>There are many things to like about the Canon BJC-8200, my choice in the upper middle of the price range. Among them are Canon's use of six separate ink cartridges (five colors plus black) and an optical low-ink status sensor that warns the user on the computer screen when a cartridge is nearly spent.</p>
        <p>Some printer makers combine all the colors into one cartridge, which is convenient during installation. But if the budding artist in your family is going through a ''blue'' period, for example, and drains the blue ink rapidly, the rest of the cartridge must be tossed when the blue runs dry.</p>
        <p>With the Canon, only the blue cartridge has to be replaced ($10 to $16 per color).</p>
        <p>The print quality is superb, in part because of the BJC-8200's maximum resolution of 1,200 by 1,200, which Canon pointedly notes is 40 percent more dots per inch than the Epson's 1,440 by 720. Canon's print heads are remarkable, with 256 nozzles per color, or 1,536 nozzles in all, which allows precision placement of the four-picoliter ink drops.</p>
        <p>I left a few prints out on a table, prompting the expected ''Wow, did you really print these yourself?'' comments from visitors.</p>
        <p>As with the Epson, the Canon is beige, although it has a more rounded and pleasing design. It works with Macs as well as Windows machines.</p>
        <p>Towering over the others was the Hewlett-Packard Deskjet 1220C Professional Series printer, a large-format printer that demanded several square feet of desk space. It is two feet wide and, with its paper trays extended, just as deep, and at 22 pounds it is double the weight of the Canon and Epson models.</p>
        <p>It is elephantine in more ways than one; it handles paper up to 13 by 19, making it a good choice for desktop publishers, graphic artists and proud photographers. Unlike its beige challengers, the 1220C is pachyderm gray with smoky plastic highlights, a nice match for graphite-colored Macs.</p>
        <p>But it is quiet as a mouse. And it comes with an excellent printer driver, the software that controls many of the 1220C's functions and printing capabilities.</p>
        <p>When pressed, Hewlett-Packard says the resolution is 2,400 by 1,200, but it prefers to emphasize its proprietary color layering and resolution enhancement technologies. Whatever. The result is as close as I have seen to store-bought color prints, and text printing on plain paper is as sharp as an inkjet can get.</p>
