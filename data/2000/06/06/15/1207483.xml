        <p>Vladimir V. Putin arrived here today, greeted by newspaper headlines like ''Putin the German'' that suggested the intense hopes vested by Germany in a Russian president who long resided in Dresden.</p>
        <p>That Mr. Putin speaks German --  learned during his K.G.B. days in East Germany -- has been impossible to ignore. ''The second German-speaking Russian leader after Lenin,'' enthused Die Zeit, noting that all of Mr. Putin's children have been sent to German schools.</p>
        <p>But the three-day visit is more than an emotional return to an old stamping ground for the Russian president. It seems to form part of an ambitious strategy to hitch Russia firmly to Western Europe, attract investment, prod Germany to look east as much as west, and, if possible, drive a wedge between Europe and the United States.</p>
        <p>''Putin wants to do what Yeltsin and Gorbachev failed to do, and that is anchor Russia firmly in the European house,'' said Alexander Rahr, whose book ''The German in the Kremlin'' has just been published here. ''At the same time he wants to present Russia as the great power on this continent and work toward a diminishing American influence.''</p>
        <p>This thrust appeared evident in an interview this week in Welt am Sonntag where Mr. Putin expressed Russian concern at ''the attempt to put NATO at the center of the formation of a European security system'' and praised as ''constructive and sensible'' Germany's ambivalence over a proposed American national missile defense system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's message was clear: Russia and Germany have a common interest in preserving the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which the United States wants amended to allow the proposed new system. In addition, Russia should be involved in Europe's defense through its own antimissile systems that are permitted under the 1972 treaty.</p>
        <p>Germany's susceptibility to these overtures is certainly limited, given the country's fierce attachment to NATO. But Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's government has left little doubt of its determination to strengthen Russian relations, referring repeatedly to Germany's new ''strategic partnership'' with Russia, the precise term it also uses for ties with the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schroder has tried to adopt an evenhanded position on the missile defense question, siding with Washington by saying that the cohesion of the allies must not be affected, but winking at Moscow by insisting that there must be no new arms race and that the existing ''disarmament architecture'' must be preserved.</p>
        <p>The German stance underlines the fact that with the end of the cold war, Germany's room for maneuver in its relationship with Russia is far greater. It seems clear that Berlin will try to reach out to Moscow as far as is possible without causing any rupture in the Western alliance.</p>
        <p>''Russia is our biggest eastern neighbor and the stability of Europe depends on Russia more than anything else,'' said Karl Kaiser, a foreign policy expert. ''So Germany has to be the most concerned and the most involved.''</p>
        <p>In the days before Mr. Putin's arrival, the government muted its criticism of the Russian onslaught on Chechnya, avoided comment on the jailing of Vladimir A. Gusinsky, the head of a Russian media conglomerate, and sought to portray the Russian president as a pragmatist with whom business can be done.</p>
        <p>To mark the significance of the visit, Germany has prepared an exceptional program. It includes four meetings between Mr. Schroder and Mr. Putin, cabinet-level discussions including several ministers from both sides, and a stroll through the Brandenburg Gate to the Reichstag by both leaders and their wives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has suggested that his long stay is motivated in part by ''the special place Germany, its people and its culture have in my heart.'' But he also has immediate and concrete economic goals. More than 60 percent of Russia's foreign debt of over $150 billion is to Germany, and Mr. Putin wants some debt relief. He also appears determined to persuade German companies that Russia's domestic situation is stable enough to warrant major investments.</p>
        <p>The German government has been making encouraging remarks about the recovery in the Russian economy, and at least one major joint venture in the energy sector is expected to be announced during the visit. But outright debt forgiveness appears unlikely, although some rescheduling may be agreed on.</p>
        <p>The strategic thrust of Mr. Putin in the economic field appears to be clearly tied to his overtures in the military area: involve European firms heavily in Russia to demonstrate Russia's membership of the European house and its greater sympathy for the ''social market'' model of Germany than the harsher capitalist model of the United States.</p>
