        <p>Anchor Delivers A Bash for a Cook</p>
        <p>Maybe the 100 people at ELLEN WRIGHT'S book party yesterday evening just wanted to see TOM BROKAW'S apartment. (Aside to vicarious voyeurs: it is a high-floor duplex in a prewar building on the Upper East Side. It is also where, in 1986, Mrs. Wright married JOSEPH R. WRIGHT JR., who was associate director of the Office of Management and Budget at the time. But that is another story.)</p>

        <p>Anchor Delivers A Bash for a Cook</p>
        <p>Maybe the 100 people at ELLEN WRIGHT'S book party yesterday evening just wanted to see TOM BROKAW'S apartment. (Aside to vicarious voyeurs: it is a high-floor duplex in a prewar building on the Upper East Side. It is also where, in 1986, Mrs. Wright married JOSEPH R. WRIGHT JR., who was associate director of the Office of Management and Budget at the time. But that is another story.)</p>
        <p>Maybe the party-goers just wanted the hors d'oeuvres. Each platter carried a tag indicating what page in Ms. Wright's book ''Bridgehampton Weekends,'' the recipe was on.</p>
        <p>''Ellen Wright is the single best cook I know,'' declared Mr. Brokaw, who arrived after signing off on ''The NBC Nightly News.''</p>
        <p>Then, with the precision of a correspondent doing a 20-second standup, Mr. Brokaw mentioned the following facts: He has known Mrs. Wright for 25 years, her father founded the Stride Rite shoe company and she studied with James Beard, the chef and food authority who died in 1985.</p>
        <p>''In my 'Today' show days,'' he said, she appeared in a cooking segment with Beard -- an occasion Ms. Wright remembers well.</p>
        <p>She said, ''Tom had a Prince Valiant haircut. We were julienning vegetables in these very precise shapes. Nowadays, nobody's interested in being so perfect, julienning vegetables. Things have changed. I'm into diner food, if you can combine it with elegant presentation and make it casual.''</p>
        <p>2 Men, 2 Views, 2 Letters to Editor</p>
        <p>The headline on the letters to the editor in the June 19th issue of The New Republic magazine is: ''Everybody's a Critic.'' It could just as easily have been ''Everybody's a Brother.'' The first letter was from ROBERT G. KAISER, an associate editor and senior correspondent of The Washington Post. The second was from his brother, CHARLES.</p>
        <p>The two letters were about an earlier article that called HOWARD KURTZ, the Post's media reporter, more of a critic than a reporter.</p>
        <p>Robert Kaiser defended Mr. Kurtz, while Charles Kaiser (a former media critic for Newsweek) criticized him for ''taking money from the people he writes about,'' including, Charles Kaiser said, Time Warner. (Mr. Kurtz is a co-host of ''Reliable Sources'' on CNN, which is owned by Time Warner.)</p>
        <p>Two letters from two brothers?</p>
        <p>''I wrote one without telling my brother, and he wrote one without telling me,'' Charles Kaiser said. ''We're very close and, generally speaking, we agree about most important things. But sometimes we disagree about unimportant things like Mr. Kurtz.'' A moment later he added, ''We're not competitive in any way, except that I'm taller and smarter and better looking.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Robert Kaiser said he and his brother had addressed different issues.</p>
        <p>''I know that Charles and others have those qualms about Howie's multiple employers,'' he said. ''Howie always discloses his relationships when he writes about any of them. The Post has accepted that arrangement. I think it's O.K. But I don't think it's O.K. to lambaste Howie for not being a better critic because he's not supposed to be a critic.''</p>
        <p>The Kaisers' letters were followed by one from Mr. Kurtz, who called the original article ''ambitious (if spectacularly wrongheaded).''</p>
        <p>Left Lipstickless At the Whitney</p>
        <p>The goodie bag given to guests leaving the Whitney Museum's American Art Awards dinner on Monday was unusual: there was no lipstick inside. It did contain two Tommy Hilfiger products. No surprise there; the Hilfiger cosmetics brand is made by Estee Lauder, and LEONARD A. LAUDER is chairman of the museum's board.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Lauder was asked how many tubes of lipstick he gives away every year. He frowned. ''If I knew the exact number,'' he said, ''I'd probably lose a lot of sleep.''</p>
