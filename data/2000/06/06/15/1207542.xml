        <p>DURING one of the greatest bull markets in history, how has Edgar Bronfman Jr. done for the shareholders of the Seagram Company since he took control nearly six years ago and sought to recast his liquor and beverage giant as a liquor, media and entertainment empire?</p>
        <p>With the Bronfman family negotiating to sell Seagram in an all-stock deal to Vivendi S.A., the French conglomerate that wants to expand its holdings in the entertainment business, the answer is that Mr. Bronfman has added some value, but Seagram's performance has lagged the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.</p>
        <p>Indeed, even if Seagram receives $77 a share, the highest rumored price yesterday, its stock would have appreciated 166.6 percent since May 1994, compared with more than 200 percent for the S.&amp; P. 500. Its shares rose $7.125 yesterday, to $60.125.</p>
        <p>The appreciation in the stock since 1994 could grow depending on what price is paid, of course, but the deal still faces hurdles, including the fact that Vivendi does not yet trade in the United States.</p>
        <p>And if Mr. Bronfman had not undertaken a transformation of Seagram and had simply retained its holdings, it is not entirely clear that the per-share value of the company would have been much different from what it is today, according to analyses by a media analyst and an industry executive, both of whom insisted on anonymity.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the stock has improved. So why a sale? The company has said that it feels it cannot compete in a world of far larger media companies. Still, Mr. Bronfman's performance has been criticized over the years, and while the Bronfman family certainly supports him publicly, at least one family member, his uncle, Charles Bronfman, has sold about 10 percent of his holdings to make investments elsewhere.</p>
        <p>A sale will allow Edgar Bronfman Jr., who is expected to become vice chairman of the combined company, to follow the trend of media mergers. It will also produce profits for the Bronfman family, which has run Seagram for three generations and will be the largest single shareholder of the merged company, receiving 5 of the expected 18 board seats. Any gains, however, will be influenced by Vivendi's stock. Its price has risen sharply over the last year, but its future performance is uncertain.</p>
        <p>One person close to the negotiations said yesterday that Mr. Bronfman had been having some misgivings about reporting to Jean-Marie Messier, the chairman of Vivendi. Nevertheless, the deal still has a decent chance of closing, he said. Still, the muted response of Seagram's stock raised questions about shareholders' confidence in a merger.</p>
        <p>Precise terms have not been announced. Seagram's board is expected to meet informally on Saturday in New York and then formally on Wednesday at its regularly scheduled meeting, though the deal may not be announced for two weeks or more, one person close to the discussions said. The deal could be worth as much as $33.5 billion, a second person close to the transaction said. And Seagram shareholders will be protected with a minimum guarantee said to be at least 90 percent of the agreed-on per-share price if either Vivendi's stock drops or exchange rates move unfavorably.</p>
        <p>Vivendi is a diversified conglomerate that has been scrambling under Mr. Messier to expand from mundane industries like water utilities to pay television and advertising.</p>
        <p>Seagram was an attractive target because of Mr. Bronfman's razzle-dazzle acquisition tear. He started with a $2 billion investment in Time Warner and went on to buy 80 percent of MCA, the parent company of the Universal film and television studios; several record companies, including Polygram; and the 50 percent of USA Network and the Sci-Fi Channel it did not already own.</p>
        <p>And Seagram did more than buy assets. When Mr. Bronfman could not find suitable managers for his television and cable operations, he sold 50 percent of the cable channels to USA Networks Inc., along with a half-interest in its own television production business, betting that USA's chairman, Barry Diller, could run them better.</p>
        <p>Despite the glamour connected with buying film, music and theme park businesses, Seagram's performance has been erratic. When Mr. Bronfman took over, Seagram consisted of a liquor company and a 25 percent stake in DuPont.</p>
        <p>Had the company simply held on to its DuPont holdings, rather than selling nearly all of them in 1995, they would be worth roughly $24 billion, according to both an analyst and an industry expert.</p>
        <p>The 328 million shares of DuPont the company then owned are now worth $14.7 billion. And the liquor business, these experts said, would be worth about $7 billion.</p>
        <p>He pointed out that Seagram would have added roughly $1.5 billion in cash from DuPont dividends and the estimated $3 billion to $4 billion in capital it used to invest in the entertainment business. That would have brought the value of Seagram to about $27 billion, compared with its current value of $26 billion. Although the company has issued new stock since Mr. Bronfman took over, there were originally 350 million shares outstanding. Per share, the company would have been worth about $77 a share. Vivendi would spend an additional $6.6 billion because Seagram now has 436 million shares outstanding.</p>
        <p>A Seagram spokesman argued that such comparisons were not valid because the company's stake in DuPont was illiquid, thus making it difficult for the company to realize its value, regardless of the stock price. And he noted that Seagram had increased its ''enterprise value'' -- in this case the combined value of its stock market capitalization, based on the offer price, and debt -- from $15 billion in 1995 to $41 billion.</p>
        <p>In the view of Bruce Greenwald, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia University: ''If something is illiquid, the right strategy is to sell it off slowly over time because the market is relatively thin compared to the size of the holdings. Had Seagram sold DuPont over four years, it would have realized substantially more as the price rose over $80 a share.''</p>
        <p>As to the enterprise value argument, he noted that ''adding the debt ignores that much of the value is simply money Seagram borrowed and put into the business.''</p>
        <p>''If this argument were valid, businessmen could borrow huge amounts of money, put it into their business, raising enterprise value, regardless of performance.''</p>
        <p>The larger question will be how savvy was Mr. Bronfman's decision to enter the film and music business. Though Universal Pictures has recently benefited from hits like ''Erin Brockovich,'' its film business has suffered, reporting a $206 million operating loss in the 1999 fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Seagram has been aggressively building its music business, paying $10.4 billion for Polygram last year. And though Mr. Bronfman is a big fan of the music industry, the sale of music assets may be well timed.</p>
        <p>Vivendi is paying a premium to buy heavily into the music industry at a time when its future is uncertain because of the online transmission of songs through services like Napster, which raises copyright questions.</p>
        <p>''Until some of the potential becomes clearer, it remains vulnerable,'' said Michael Nathanson, a music industry analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.</p>
