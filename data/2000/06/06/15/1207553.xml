        <p>The mayor-elect of this town apologized the other day for his appearance and hoarse voice, a result of a hard-run election campaign, and immediately launched into a long explanation of the cap on his desk and the typical Serbian wedding at which it is worn.</p>
        <p>The mayor-elect, Djuro Cetkovic, a local leader of the Socialist People's Party, had just orchestrated a  political victory for the Serbs of Montenegro and in turn for the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cetkovic's pro-Belgrade coalition defeated the Montenegrin government coalition in local elections here on Sunday, giving Milosevic supporters control of 7 out of 21 municipalities in this republic, the junior partner, with Serbia, in the Yugoslav federation.</p>
        <p>The loss of Herceg Novi is a blow for the Montenegrin leader, Milo Djukanovic, who strongly opposes  Mr. Milosevic and is trying to draw his republic out from under the Milosevic sway. The government held on to the capital, Podgorica, but its defeat in Herceg Novi, on the coast, gave a lift to his opponents at home and in Belgrade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cetkovic had clearly been celebrating, and his supporters said they were already looking forward to federal elections later this year.</p>
        <p>Herceg Novi has always been the most closely contested of municipalities and the swing in the election result from the previous local government was small. The pro-Serbia coalition won 19 of the 35 seats, an improvement on the 17 it and its coalition partners held previously. The government coalition dropped to 14 seats, from 15, and its former coalition partner, the Liberal Alliance lost 1 of its 3 seats.</p>
        <p>But these elections were more important than the local issues and voters and politicians alike have taken the results as important indicators for the future. ''My face hurts from forcing a smile to show I don't mind,'' said the local Liberal Alliance secretary, Panto Pavicevic.</p>
        <p>Sitting despondently in a cafe, he and the local party chief, Budimir Katuric, acknowledged that they had been outclassed by the good organization of the pro-Belgrade coalition headed by the Socialist People's Party, known as the S.N.P.</p>
        <p>''A lot of young people did not come out to vote, and they are usually our supporters,'' Mr. Katuric said. ''But 100 percent of the S.N.P. people came out, so they did not throw away a single vote.''</p>
        <p>There is no doubt that the liberals and the government party blundered badly. The Liberals withdrew from the coalition and forced these elections, hoping to increase their vote, but clearly misjudged. Mr. Katruic even admitted that the new results giving the the Socialist People's Party a majority are a truer reflection of local society.</p>
        <p>The government paid the price for its poor performance over the last two years in the eyes of the people of Herceg Novi, and for allowing corruption to flourish, enriching a small elite while ordinary people have seen their standard of living plummet.</p>
        <p>''There were some mistakes made by our party and people are weighing it up,'' said Zarko Mandic, head of a local school and member of the government party, the Democratic Party of Socialists. ''It is a step backwards and the government must take it as an important lesson.''</p>
        <p>The Serb leader, Mr. Cetkovic, judged it right. His coalition had been weakened by its divisions in the last elections, he said, and this time they presented a united front.</p>
        <p>The election centered on the fundamental preoccupation in Montenegrin society, whether to stay, or split from Serbia. That single issue is felt particularly acutely in Herceg Novi, a predominantly ethnic-Serb town.</p>
        <p>Most people interviewed in Herceg Novi today, workers, pensioners, office workers and businessmen, said they had voted for the pro-Serbia coalition in order to stay within Yugoslavia. Few seemed to care about Mr. Milosevic himself but voiced fears of being cut off from Serbia.</p>
        <p>''I voted for Yugoslavia,'' said Nenad Susic, a businessman and owner of a confectionary business. ''My closest friends are in Serbia. There is no one here who does not have ties with Serbia. We are for integration, not disintegration.''</p>
        <p>Many complained that the Montenegrin government was already moving away from Serbia, cutting them off from family, friends and business partners through its economic policies. The introduction of the German mark as the main currency has brought higher prices and in turn caused Serbia to impose a trade blockade which has hurt ordinary people, they said.</p>
        <p>''I personally voted for change,'' said a restaurant owner, Seka, who asked that her full name not be used. ''My thought is that Montenegro is too small for independence, but the feeling is that the government is taking us that way. Serbs are finding it more difficult here. We lived here mostly on Serb tourists and now they are not coming.''</p>
        <p>Herceg Novi, with about 42,000 people, has a high proportion of ethnic Serbs, although the breakdown between Montenegrins and Serbs is murky since many people are actually vague about their origins. Mr. Katuric, the Liberal Alliance leader, estimated the divide as 50-50. The Serbian leader, Mr. Cetkovic, suggested the Serb element was over 90 percent. At least 9,000 Serb refugees from wars in neighboring Bosnia and Croatia have also swelled the district population over the last 10 years and have been given the right to vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cetkovic is a passionate defender of the Serbs and can trace his family roots here back 300 years. He says that virtually all of those who live in Herceg Novi follow Serbian Orthodox Christianity and thus are Serbs. Montenegro appears to be a sideshow in Mr. Cetkovic's thinking.</p>
        <p>What is clear is that Belgrade's propaganda is still finding fertile ground and has worked on people's fears, while the Montenegrin government has failed to allay them.</p>
