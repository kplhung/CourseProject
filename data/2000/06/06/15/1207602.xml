        <p>For the last six months, nearly every public meeting of the Nassau County Legislature has been punctuated by the anguished appeals of social workers deploring the budget cuts made to the county's social service agencies.</p>
        <p>When the Legislature met here today, though, there were no such complaints. Under a budget accord reached Monday, the cash-starved county agreed to restore $1 million to the social service agencies this year and more next year. But there were plenty of complaints from another aggrieved group: handgun owners and enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>The gun owners were upset that the county has decided to raise revenues by increasing the fee for a pistol permit to $200 from $40, and the fee for a renewal to $200 from $25. And they came here to tell the Legislature about it in no uncertain terms.</p>
        <p>Angry speakers extolled their right to bear arms and compared the county's actions to the actions of Hitler, Stalin and Saddam Hussein. One speaker, who was white, accused the Legislature of acting like the Ku Klux Klan, saying that the higher fees would keep poor black people from being able to afford guns.</p>
        <p>Roger H. Corbin, a Democratic legislator who is black, took exception to the comparison. ''I'm offended,'' he said. ''This is not a racial issue; it's a fiscal issue.''</p>
        <p>The fee increases were included in a package of budget cuts and new revenues that the county agreed upon on Monday to qualify for a $105 million state bailout proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki to help Nassau out of its fiscal woes.</p>
        <p>Under the deal, which was passed today in Albany by the State Senate and the Assembly, the state will give the county $105 million in aid over the next five years and appoint a seven-member board to refinance Nassau's debt, monitor its budgets and, if the county fails to act responsibly, take over its finances.</p>
        <p>The county, in return, must cut its budget by $50 million this year and $70 million in each of the following three years.</p>
        <p>But several gun owners said they believed the county was more interested in gun control than in solving its fiscal crisis.</p>
        <p>The fee increase, one of more than 60 initiatives that members of the Legislature and County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta tentatively agreed to on Friday, was marked by some odd behind-the-scenes politicking. Republicans in the Legislature were angered when a member of their delegation, Salvatore B. Pontillo, spoke to Mr. Gulotta on his own on Saturday and expressed reservations about the fee increases.</p>
        <p>''He almost scuttled the whole plan, on his own,'' one official said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pontillo said that he meant no disloyalty and had simply spoken his mind about the plan when he met Mr. Gulotta by chance at an event. A licensed gun owner, Mr. Pontillo said he was concerned that the gun increases were much greater than other fee increases.</p>
        <p>But he said he recognized the need for a unified front to show to Albany and the credit-rating agencies that have threatened to downgrade the county's bonds to junk.</p>
