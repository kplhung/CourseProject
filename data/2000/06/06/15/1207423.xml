        <p>When the Ambassador Hotel opened in 1921, it drew the social and political elite. Entertainers like Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland played at the hotel's Cocoanut Grove nightclub, and stars gathered around the pool (inset). Richard Nixon wrote his famous ''Checkers'' speech in the hotel, and Robert F. Kennedy was slain there in 1968. But in 1989 the Ambassador went out of business, and today it stands a  good chance of being torn down.</p>
        <p>Designed by Myron Hunt, the pared-down-Italianate building had its first brush with demolition 11 years ago, when a consortium including Donald J. Trump announced plans to build a skyscraper and retail complex on the site. That project became tangled in legal knots after a school district condemned much of the site and announced plans -- later canceled, now urgently revived -- to build a high school.</p>
        <p>Fighting to give the Ambassador a second life is the small but influential Los Angeles Conservancy. It views the Ambassador as the first grand hotel in Los Angeles, an important work by an important architect and a cultural landmark.</p>
        <p>Gathering recently in the ghostly Cocoanut Grove lounge, civic leaders and the owner, Wilshire Center Marketplace, threw rhetorical support behind the notion of preserving the Ambassador while also creating a school and a retail complex. Unclear is how, or even if, that dream can be realized.</p>
