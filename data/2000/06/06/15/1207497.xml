        <p>The outrageous and violent behavior of a large gang of young men who were totally out of control in Central Park on Sunday was a troubling reminder of the bad old days that most New Yorkers, myself included, had felt were behind us. It seems inconceivable that over two dozen women could have been assaulted in broad daylight. Fear is now consuming the public -- a fear that was compounded by a weekend that also saw seven homicides and 28 shootings in the city.</p>
        <p>When I first came to New York from Boston in 1990 as chief of the Transit Police, the city was still reeling from the Central Park jogger case. A woman running in the park had been viciously assaulted and left for dead by a marauding ''wolf pack,'' as the gangs of young men roaming the streets and subways had come to be known. Their ''wilding'' attacks came to epitomize just how unsafe New York had become and contributed to a pervasive fear.</p>
        <p>So deeply scarred was the city by the jogger incident and other crimes symbolizing a city out of control that even now one weekend of violence can shatter our still fragile belief that we have truly turned a corner, that New York is, as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani correctly proclaims, ''the safest large city in America.''</p>
        <p>In dealing with the crime of the 1980's and early 1990's, the police and politicians learned not only to improve their response to crime but to accept responsibility for controlling it and to focus more of their efforts on preventing it. Government, not the mob, must control the streets.</p>
        <p>What is particularly troubling about Sunday's incident, which took place amid the crowds that remained in Midtown after the annual National Puerto Rican Day Parade, is the apparent deficiency of both the crowd control strategies that the Police Department has become so famous for and the initial response (or lack of it) by some officers to the victims' reported pleas for assistance.</p>
        <p>The horror for the victims subjected to sexual assault and degradation is that the memories will stay with them forever. The tragedy for New York itself is that as videotapes of the attacks have been widely broadcast (some of the victims were European tourists, and their ordeals were widely covered at home), the still forming image of a safer city has been tarnished around the world.</p>
        <p>The truth is that New York is a much safer city than it was a decade ago. But we must also focus on perception. The reality for the victims of Sunday's assaults is that they happened; overall crime statistics are of no consolation to them. The perception of most other New Yorkers, particularly women, is that somehow in a day New York became a much more threatening place.</p>
        <p>The mayor and the Police Department must move aggressively to investigate not only the incident itself but police planning and actions. New York's police are practiced in tactics that are known to work in managing large gatherings like New Year's Eve in Times Square or the big parades.</p>
        <p>Before any such event, a strong message must go out that law breaking and drunkenness will not be tolerated. At the event itself, there must be a strong and visible police presence to control the ground and make sure rowdiness has no chance to get out of hand. Afterward, officers should not be relieved of duty until it is confirmed that there is no longer a need for police presence in a particular area. And all day there must be continuous reassessment and follow-up to make sure that problems and disturbances have not migrated to areas with thinner police coverage.</p>
        <p>But as the investigation determines where the lapses were on Sunday, the mayor and the police must also, through their expressions of outrage, sympathy and determination to get at the facts, begin to deal with the fear. Fear, if left unchecked, will allow perception to overcome reality.</p>
        <p>The public needs meaningful reassurance that Sunday's crime spree is not a precursor of more bad times ahead. The Police Department must use the events as a spur to remain constantly vigilant and not be lulled into a sense of complacency. The statistics and the accomplishments of the past deserve to be celebrated, but they cannot be substituted for a Police Department that is compassionate to victims, responsive to the public and intolerant at all times of criminal behavior.</p>
