        <p>NEVER underestimate the technology industry's willingness to put any number of carts before a horse.</p>
        <p>The retrieval and exchange of data over cell phones and other mobile devices is still in its earliest stages, yet one ambitious start-up is already betting that consumers will use their cell phones to download movie trailers and other video as routinely as they place cell phone calls.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, Packet Video, a company in San Diego that produces the technology for sending full-motion color video to mobile devices, announced deals with some 35 media and online companies, including Columbia Records, ABCNews.com and the Weather Channel, all of which plan to conduct field trials of the delivery of video over cell phones and other wireless devices.</p>
        <p>Forget for a moment that no cell phone yet exists with a screen suited to receiving streaming color video. Forget, too, that data still crawls along on wireless networks at a snail's pace and video transmission demands high speeds.</p>
        <p>Robert Tercek, president of Packet Video's programming division, is an unapologetic believer in the promise of streaming video. ''We're taking our best guess at what a consumer would like and doing tests and focus groups and surveys to tailor the product offering,'' Mr. Tercek said. ''This is very much unproven.''</p>
        <p>For example, he said, ''we can work with a sports broadcaster and take a sporting event and combine it with a notification service, so you get an alert that your favorite team has scored.'' And up will pop an instant replay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tercek also proposed ''on-demand access.'' That could come in handy for someone who would like to see a videocam shot, in real time, of a traffic jam ahead. ''I'd pay money for a camera shot of the freeway,'' Mr. Tercek said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tercek said several cell phone manufacturers were working on phones with color screens.</p>
        <p>Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications, a research firm in Bethesda, Md., specializing in interactive services, is also sanguine about the market for full-motion video on wireless devices. ''There will be a significant market among early adopters,'' he said, ''especially if the programming is selective with viewable content, what I call two-minute television.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arlen added that the mobile device was not an especially ideal medium for watching movies or even half-hour sitcoms. Instead, he said, it will be useful for viewers who want to catch a few news stories or a snippet of a favorite series.</p>
        <p>The feasibility of streaming video, of course, requires speeding up digital wireless networks. In the next five years, cellular carriers will spend tens of millions of dollars upgrading to 3G, a third-generation network for high-speed wireless transmission that will produce speeds of up to 2 megabits per second, more than 35 times as fast as today's fastest dial-up modems for personal computers and more than 200 times the speed of most current handheld wireless data devices. Forecasts vary, but 3G is expected to be up and running on a number of cellular networks in this country by 2003.</p>
        <p>Europe and Japan are more prepared for mobile video, both technically and psychologically. Mr. Tercek said he got the most enthusiastic responses to his pitches in Europe and Japan, where, he said, ''the public is ready for this 100 percent.''</p>
        <p>But he said streaming video on mobile devices would gradually catch on in the United States, too. ''The way this is going to sell,'' he said, ''is when you're sitting in the San Francisco airport and you're waiting for your delayed flight and the guy next to you is trading stocks and looking at video clips from CNBC.''</p>
        <p>Asked when watching a video clip on a cell phone would become as commonplace as making a call, Mr. Arlen said that would depend on the cost of equipment and service, as well as on the quality and choice of the video available. ''Given the wireless explosion, we could see 5 million to 10 million customers for these services within six or seven years,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But for now, the carts are still in front.</p>
