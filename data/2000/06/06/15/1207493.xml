        <p>Stock prices were mixed yesterday as the Nasdaq market fell 1.39 percent, the seventh consecutive session in which the technology-dominated gauge has reversed direction from the one before, while blue chips gained.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average posted its second consecutive moderate gain after three declines as some investors appeared to seek safety among household names, embracing a range of companies from Microsoft to Alcoa.</p>
        <p>A Labor Department report showing minimal consumer inflation last month and a Federal Reserve survey of regional economies that found signs of slackening economic growth did little yesterday to change the prevailing belief that the Federal Reserve would probably forgo raising interest rates again when it meets in two weeks but might have to do so later.</p>
        <p>''The rate increases that they began a year ago have begun to bite,'' said Mary Jane Matts, director of research for National City Private Investment Advisors in Cleveland. ''But we don't think they're done'' raising rates, she added, because inflation pressures are likely to persist.</p>
        <p>To Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the market's chief worry has shifted to a focus on a possible side effect of the Fed's rate medicine: stunted growth of corporate profits.</p>
        <p>''There is a sea change,'' Mr. Galvin said.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite shed 53.65 points yesterday, to 3,797.41, leaving it 1 percent ahead of its level on June 6, when the protracted up-down pattern began. The loss so far this year is 6.68 percent.</p>
        <p>As for the Dow industrials, where 20 issues gained and 9 fell, the average climbed 66.11 points, or 0.62 percent, to 10,687.95. That narrowed its loss for the year to 7.04 percent.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index scarcely budged, edging up 1.1 points, to 1,470.54. Although winners outnumbered losers by 263 to 217, the index was weighed down by losses in Intel, off 5 1/16, to 126 7/16; Lucent, down 2 1/8, to 56 5/8; WorldCom dropping 2 7/8, to 401 3/16; Qualcomm, falling 10 7/8, to 70 1/2; and Oracle down 21 1/16, to 79. Cisco Systems managed a gain of 3/16, to 65 3/16.</p>
        <p>''I thought we'd be doing better today,'' Donald G. Berdine, chief investment officer for PNC Advisors in Pittsburgh, said yesterday, pointing to subdued inflation data and an economic slowing that he said he did not think would wind up in a so-called hard-landing. He projects that profits of the S.&amp; P. 500 companies will rise 8.3 percent next year.</p>
        <p>Seagram, which confirmed it was in negotiations to be acquired and jumped 7 1/8, to 60 1/8, was one of the day's standout gainers. Schering-Plough, which a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst raised to a ''strong buy,'' climbed 3 1/8, to 48 1/2, to pace a generally strong drug sector.</p>
        <p>Brokerage firm stocks also surged, with Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers each gaining more than 4 points, and Merrill Lynch more than 3.</p>
        <p>Turnover on the New York Stock Exchange was 929.8 million shares, slightly less than on Tuesday, as 1,687 stocks rose and 1,253 fell.</p>
