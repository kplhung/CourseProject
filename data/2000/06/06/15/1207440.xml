        <p>JON SILVAN likes to think of himself as someone who is comfortable with technology, who can understand and use the latest gadgetry that modern life brings his way. But the radio in his new BMW 740i, of all things, had him flummoxed. Trying to use the radio's touch screen made him feel as if he were on his first day on the job behind the soundboard at a rock concert.</p>
        <p>''You have to go through so many screens just to get to the scan,'' said Mr. Silvan, a partner in a market research firm in New York. ''For $70,000 you'd think it would be easier to figure out.''</p>
        <p>During several trips commuting to and from home, Mr. Silvan discovered that the scanning feature was actually a subset of the Select screen, which also included Manual Start and Automatic Scan options. ''I have no idea what those do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As car radios have evolved into control centers for more sophisticated audio systems in the last few years, they have become increasingly complicated to use. Buttons and dials perform more functions, and because radios must share dashboard space with other devices, including satellite navigation systems, they have gotten smaller as well.</p>
        <p>''We're adding a ton of features and still trying to keep the interface as simple as possible, which is a huge challenge,'' said Jim Foley, a technical specialist at Visteon -- now the Ford Motor Company's automotive parts unit in Dearborn, Mich., but soon to become an independent company. Mr. Foley said Visteon tested its dashboard audio interfaces by putting test subjects in arcade-style driving seats and watching how long it took them to do things like insert CD's and press preset buttons.</p>
        <p>The explosion of functions on today's car radios has led to a certain nostalgia among drivers for the plain old knob that adjusted the volume or tuned in a station.</p>
        <p>''Knobs were easier to use when you're driving,'' said Marie O'Neill, of Upper Arlington, Ohio, who buys a new car about every four years and frequently drives long distances. ''Now I have an arrow button, which I frequently have to push and push without getting anything.''</p>
        <p>Tom Magliozzi, co-host of ''Car Talk,'' a program on National Public Radio, said: ''The trend I see is that the more expensive the car, the more complicated the car radio is. They're doing it because if you're paying $75,000, they think you must want something fancy. You don't want a plain old radio.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Magliozzi said he thought that the touch-screen menus found on the radios in some expensive vehicles could be dangerous.</p>
        <p>''Even if you figure out how to use one,'' he said, ''you still have to go through this business with the touch-screen menus to get to the radio. How are you going to use a touch screen when you're driving a car? They think you're sitting at your desk.''</p>
        <p>Just as they do with computer software and home entertainment systems, many people take the time to learn only what they need to on their car radios and leave the more sophisticated functions alone.</p>
        <p>''There's a button on my radio called Phone,'' said Earl Hefley, a musician in Oklahoma City, ''and I think it's some kind of mute switch for when you're on a cell phone, but I don't know. I'm convinced that the secret to it all is to read the book.'' And he would read the owner's manual, Mr. Hefley said, if it wasn't so long.</p>
        <p>Mark Erdman, manager of Radios, Knobs, Speakers and Things, a car audio store in Pontiac, Mich., said that when his employees installed a new radio, they showed the customer how to do basic things like programming in favorite stations and setting the clock. But he said the customers often return when they forget what they learned.</p>
        <p>''We spend a lot of time training them, and retraining them, and retraining them again,'' Mr. Erdman said. ''The more money you spend, the more features you have to learn. In a lot of cases the radios are overfeatured for what the customer will use them for.''</p>
        <p>Car radio manufacturers, including Delphi Delco Electronics Systems, which makes radios for General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen, say they are working on making radios easier to operate while driving.</p>
        <p>''We've been moving to larger buttons with differentiating shapes to allow the driver to operate by feel without taking their eyes off the road,'' said Ken Erickson, product line manager for audio systems at Delphi Delco. The radios the company makes for Buicks, for example, now have dimpled volume knobs as well as larger display screens.</p>
        <p>Some companies, like Ford and General Motors, are looking at voice activation to help limit the number of buttons and make it safer for people to fiddle with the radio while driving. Next year, Cadillac Sevilles and Devilles will offer an optional system made by Delphi Delco that will let drivers send e-mail, talk on a cell phone and activate radio and CD functions with voice commands.</p>
        <p>Visteon has already incorporated optional voice-activated controls into the Jaguar S-Type's radio and CD changer. The radio lets the driver tune into favorite stations by saying ''radio'' and reciting the station's call letters, numbers or preset number. To prevent the radio from getting confused when people talk inside the car, the Jaguar's voice activation requires the push of a button.</p>
        <p>Many car companies, like Ford, Toyota and General Motors, also offer optional steering wheel controls that let drivers increase and lower volume or change stations or CD tracks without touching the dashboard.</p>
        <p>''We do what we can to keep the drivers' hands on the steering wheel and their eyes on the road,'' said Anders Hellen, an ergonomic specialist at the Volvo Car Corporation.</p>
