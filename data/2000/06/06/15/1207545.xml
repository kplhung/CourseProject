        <p>Editorial says first encounter between leaders of North and South Korea did not end tensions, but it did begin to overcome enmity of a half-century, paving way to address more difficult political and military issues; supports Clinton administration's decision to lift many sanctions against North Korea</p>

        <p>This week's first encounter between the leaders of North and South Korea did not end tensions in one of the most volatile corners of the world, but it did begin to overcome the enmity of a half-century. The Clinton administration rightly seeks to reinforce the gains by lifting many sanctions against Pyongyang. The North-South meetings unfolded in a surprisingly cordial atmosphere, and yesterday's joint declaration, though vaguely worded, contained just about all that could be realistically hoped for from this initial meeting. President Kim Dae Jung returns to South Korea with his stature enhanced. North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, shed some of his reputation for reclusiveness and mystery.</p>
        <p>The agreement addresses the long-term issues of reconciliation and eventual reunification, and the more immediate matters of economic and cultural exchanges and reunions of families divided since the Korean War. South Korea also promised to consider handing over prisoners who have served out their sentences for spying for the North. Encouragingly, both leaders pledged to follow up this week's sessions with a reciprocal visit by Kim Jong Il to Seoul, at ''the earliest appropriate moment.''</p>

        <p>This week's first encounter between the leaders of North and South Korea did not end tensions in one of the most volatile corners of the world, but it did begin to overcome the enmity of a half-century. The Clinton administration rightly seeks to reinforce the gains by lifting many sanctions against Pyongyang. The North-South meetings unfolded in a surprisingly cordial atmosphere, and yesterday's joint declaration, though vaguely worded, contained just about all that could be realistically hoped for from this initial meeting. President Kim Dae Jung returns to South Korea with his stature enhanced. North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, shed some of his reputation for reclusiveness and mystery.</p>
        <p>The agreement addresses the long-term issues of reconciliation and eventual reunification, and the more immediate matters of economic and cultural exchanges and reunions of families divided since the Korean War. South Korea also promised to consider handing over prisoners who have served out their sentences for spying for the North. Encouragingly, both leaders pledged to follow up this week's sessions with a reciprocal visit by Kim Jong Il to Seoul, at ''the earliest appropriate moment.''</p>
        <p>South and North Korea have agreed on reconciliation plans twice before, in 1972 and 1991. Each time, the two countries soon fell back into hostility and confrontation. This week's understandings, which incorporate elements of those earlier efforts, could produce more tangible results. Unlike the previous agreements, these have been endorsed by the top political leaders of both countries and are accompanied by a series of practical first steps.</p>
        <p>If these steps are carried out on schedule, it may be possible to address more difficult political and military issues. Some earlier indicators will be whether the family visits are accomplished this summer, how plans for Kim Jong Il's visit to Seoul proceed, and whether arrangements can be worked out for a joint Korean team in the World Cup soccer competition in 2002.</p>
        <p>The two Korean leaders played down security issues, with no public mention of North Korea's demand for the withdrawal of the 37,000 American troops stationed in South Korea or of North Korea's suspended nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs. It is reasonable to put off such issues until greater trust has been established. But the border between the two Koreas remains the world's most militarized frontier. Reconciliation cannot advance very far without steps to address the North Korean threats that have made it so.</p>
