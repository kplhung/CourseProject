        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your June 14 front-page article about local school districts' use of education dollars offers further evidence to support my long-held belief that the initial call for decentralization and ''community control'' had nothing to do with education but was an effort to defuse militancy by offering community activists their slice of the patronage pie. The consistently low turnout for local school board elections clearly shows that the average citizen never really believed in the alleged reform.</p>
