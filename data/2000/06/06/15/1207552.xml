        <p>When Market Square Arena finally closed last November, Larry Bird sought out someone to take the last shot in the old building. He did not ask Chris Mullin or Reggie Miller or any of the other veteran players he coached on the Indiana Pacers.</p>
        <p>Instead, he passed the ball to a 68-year-old man for a layup. Bobby Leonard banked the ball off the glass, smiled and looked around the arena his American Basketball Association teams helped build.</p>
        <p>''Now Larry Joe is the first coach at the fieldhouse,'' said Slick Leonard, the team's play-by-play announcer. ''I can't explain it, but there's something right about that.''</p>
        <p>Before anyone knew of Bobby Knight, Leonard was captain at Indiana University when it won the national title in 1953. He played with Jerry West in his rookie season with the Lakers, moving with the franchise from Minneapolis to Los Angeles. The most incredible story from his playing days did not happen on the court. ''It'd have to be the plane crash,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Plane crash?</p>
        <p>''Well, when I was with Minneapolis in 1958, we got lost in a snowstorm,'' Leonard said. ''We ended up crash-landing in a cornfield in Carroll, Iowa. No one died. The snow was up to our chests. Had the plane gone another half of a football field, it would have gone off into a gorge and that would be it for all of us. That's my best story.''</p>
        <p>Leonard, who got his nickname when he beat George Mikan in a game of gin rummy in the 1950's, is now a man with turkey jowls and a preference for two-toned golf shoes. And he has a good friend in Bird.</p>
        <p>''If it weren't for Slick, this franchise wouldn't be here,'' Bird said. ''I can remember in 1977, he had a telethon. I can remember being glued to the TV watching him. He was singing 'Back Home in Indiana,' trying to doing everything to sell season tickets. I know the history behind the Pacers, and the most of the history is Slick Leonard.''</p>
        <p>The A.B.A. merger with the National Basketball Association -- or massacre, as Leonard likes to put it -- took a heavy financial toll on the Pacers. With Leonard as coach and his wife, Nancy, essentially serving as the general manager, the team simply did not have the investors or backing to pay a superstar.</p>
        <p>Leonard first met Bird in 1978, while he was still a junior at Indiana State and eligible for the draft. ''We didn't have any finances,'' Leonard said. ''We were really strapped. I wanted to take him, but his mother wanted him to finish school.''</p>
        <p>In 12 years as the franchise's coach, Leonard guided the Pacers to three A.B.A. titles and a magical eight-year run.</p>
        <p>''When I first got here, the downtown area was a wreck,'' he said. ''But they redid things, put some nice shops and restaurants up and turned it around. I'd like to think some of the Pacer pioneers had something to do with that.''</p>
        <p>Leonard has become one of Bird's best friends the past three years, sitting and talking with him for hours on the team plane as they shuttled off from Toronto to Miami and beyond.</p>
        <p>''Most people don't know how big-hearted Larry is,'' he said. ''We went to get a bowl of chili at the Cherry Street Bar and Grill in Philadelphia a while back, and this old lady -- she must have been about 75 -- came up to our table in an old, tattered coat.</p>
        <p>''Her hands were kind of shaking. She pulled out a crumpled napkin and asked Larry to sign it. Told him she remembered him from his playing days in Boston. Larry signed the napkin and pulled out three $100 bills. 'Thanks for coming by,' he said. 'You go get yourself a new coat.' That's who he is.''</p>
        <p>Leonard is the bridge between his good friend Bobby Plump, the man who inspired the movie ''Hoosiers'' by hitting the last shot for tiny Milan in 1954, and Bird, the coach whom he affectionately calls Larry Joe.</p>
        <p>When Leonard graduated from high school in 1950, 714 teams vied for the state title. ''Sometimes, there were only 12 to 15 boys in the whole school, but they all played,'' he said. ''Every town had a team. And if that team advanced to regionals in Martinsville -- that's where John Wooden is from, you know -- the town locked up.''</p>
        <p>Soon after Market Square Arena closed, Leonard gathered his belongings and walked a few blocks to the new Conseco Fieldhouse, the Camden Yards of basketball, an arena that pays homage to all the parents who nailed a rim to their barn in the hope that their child would grow up to be Slick or Larry.</p>
        <p>Conseco is a monument to the past. A quote from James Naismith hangs in the concourse. A grand rotunda, reminiscent of Madison Square Garden, has a retro-1950's decor, a clacking notice board like a train station, Oscar Robertson's jersey, cut-down nets, scratched and shiny trophies and yellowed newspaper clippings.</p>
        <p>''It reminded me of when I walked into the old Garden in 1954, when I saw pictures of Joe Louis on the wall,'' Leonard said. ''All we had was radio back then, and I listened to Friday night fights every week. What they've done with Conseco is bring back the past. They've incorporated what Indiana basketball is supposed to be about.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, in the rafters, among the retired jerseys, there is a banner for Coach Bobby Leonard and his 529 victories. You can't explain it, but there's something right about that.</p>
