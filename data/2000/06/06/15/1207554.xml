        <p>The setting is perfect, the stakes are high and many of the world's best players seem poised to play their best.</p>
        <p>This week's United States Open, which begins Thursday, is one of the most anticipated major championships in recent years. It is the 100th Open. It will be played at Pebble Beach, one of the world's most beautiful courses, set up this week to be perhaps more challenging than ever. And the absence of Payne Stewart, last year's champion, who was killed in a plane crash last October, has added an emotional element.</p>
        <p>From Thursday's first tee shot, until the final putt drops, this Open has the potential to be one of the most competitive and compelling. Tiger Woods is the man to beat, as the world's No. 1 player returns to the same course where he won dramatically in February. But Woods has never won a United States Open, and since 1980, only two players under age 30 have won the Open -- Ernie Els, who did it twice (1994 and 1997), and Lee Janzen, who was 28 when he won the 1994 Open at Baltusrol in Springfield, N.J.</p>
        <p>Can Woods, at age 24, win his third different major? Or will one of the many other contenders succeed Stewart as the next Open champion? The story will unfold for four days, on a breathtaking stretch of land bordering the Pacific Ocean. Many players expect to win. But only one will.</p>
        <p>''Any time Tiger plays a golf tournament, you have to look at him as a favorite,'' said David Duval, ranked No. 2 in the world. ''But I think this is the kind of event that brings everybody closer together.</p>
        <p>''I think it's wide open. At this point, you're doing a disservice to Tiger comparing him to me. He has really outplayed me the past year. But I think when you enter a U.S. Open, it is a great equalizer. Whoever is on top of their game and on top of their wits and nerves and attitude is the guy you need to look to as the favorite.''</p>
        <p>Many players can make a strong case for themselves. Seven of the top 10 players in the world ranking have at least one victory since April. Woods won the Memorial Tournament in May. Vijay Singh won the Masters in April. Phil Mickelson won the BellSouth Classic in April and the MasterCard Colonial in May. Colin Montgomerie won the Volvo PGA Championship last month. Hal Sutton, who is bothered by a sore back this week, won the Greater Greensboro Chrysler Classic in April. Jesper Parnevik won the GTE Byron Nelson Classic last month. And Lee Westwood won the Deutsche Bank-SAP Open last month.</p>
        <p>Those who have flirted with winning recently include Duval, who lost in a playoff Sunday to Dennis Paulson at the Buick Classic; Love, who has three second-place finishes this year; and Els, who finished second at the Masters.</p>
        <p>Rarely have so many top players entered a recent major feeling so confident. But Pebble Beach will hurt some feelings this week.</p>
        <p>With the rough thick, the fairways narrow and the greens fast, Pebble Beach may not allow anyone to shoot under par.</p>
        <p>''I feel that level par will be the winning score,'' said Montgomerie, who finished third the last time the Open was played at Pebble Beach, in 1992. ''A lot of players would take that before we start.</p>
        <p>''I have a plan of attack to be level par after two days. Whatever anyone else does, I feel level par on Friday evening will put me in a good frame to go into the weekend. I won't deliberately double-bogey the last hole if I'm 2 under, but level par is a target.''</p>
        <p>The difficulty of the course will force normally aggressive players to take a more conservative approach. The mental game is a huge part of any Open, and players who lose their cool after a few bogeys could easily fall out of contention.</p>
        <p>Yet, no matter what happens, Woods will be a major part of the story. He has already won four times this year, he has won two majors -- the 1997 Masters and the 1999 P.G.A. Championship -- and he enters this major playing the most consistent golf of his young, yet remarkable, career.</p>
        <p>Asked about Woods's presence, Montgomerie said, ''We're all looking for one score all the time, and it's his.''</p>
        <p>But Woods is one of the many who will believe that this weekend could be special. Only one player will leave as the champion. And whoever that player is will have earned it.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a very difficult week,'' Woods said. ''If you go around and make 72 straight pars, I guarantee you have a chance to win.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>STEVE ELKINGTON, the 1995 P.G.A. Championship winner, withdrew Wednesday with a sinus condition that also forced him to withdraw from the Buick Classic last week. He was replaced by RORY SABBATINI, who will play in his first United States Open.</p>
