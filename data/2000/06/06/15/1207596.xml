        <p>Something was amiss in Historic Richmondtown.</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon, Tom Lloyd was taking his 4-year-old daughter for a walk through the town, a reconstructed village of old farm buildings nestled deep in the green heart of Staten Island.</p>
        <p>There was the old mill. There were the creek and the pond and the little waterfall. There were the ducks and geese for little Jenna Lloyd to feed.</p>
        <p>But what was that thing in the stream that looked like an alligator?</p>
        <p>Mr. Lloyd, a 33-year-old contractor, picked up a stick and poked at the largish, dark green gator-like object with brown spots that he figured must have been a toy.</p>
        <p>It snapped at him.</p>
        <p>'' 'Well,' I said, 'it's alive,' '' Mr. Lloyd recalled last night.</p>
        <p>It was unclear what a 4-foot, 5-inch  American alligator was doing in Richmond Creek. The northern edge of Alligator mississipiensis's natural range is in North Carolina, said Bill Holstrom, the supervisor of the reptile department at the Bronx Zoo.</p>
        <p>''Someone probably dumped him in there,'' Mr. Holstrom said.</p>
        <p>But it was clear that the gator could not be permitted to stay. Mr. Lloyd alerted a police officer. The officer called for backup.</p>
        <p>Within minutes, two officers from the Emergency Service Unit arrived. Acting on instructions from a reptile rescue expert, the officers, James McCarthy and Peter Molly, lassoed the gator's snout with a noose, reeled it in and fastened its jaws shut with duct tape, Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman, said.</p>
        <p>Then they popped the creature into the back seat of a squad car and drove off.</p>
        <p>''Daddy, I think they're arresting the alligator,'' Jenna Lloyd said.</p>
        <p>The officers took the alligator to a T-shirt shop in the East Village owned by the reptile rescue expert, Robert Shapiro. Mr. Shapiro has an arrangement with the Center for Animal Care and Control, the city's official stray-catcher, to take all of the city's castoff reptiles. He has hundreds of them in the back of his shop, Social Tees, at 125 East 4th Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shapiro said that each year he typically processes about five crocodilians -- the order that includes alligators, crocodiles and caimans. But most of them are surrendered to him directly by owners of the illegal pets who have decided that they can no longer care for them. Despite the rumors of gators swimming around the city's sewers, he said he had never heard of a live gator turning up in New York City before.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shapiro said that the gator, a 35-pound sub-adult between 2 and 5 years old, was in fine shape and relatively peaceful. ''He was hissing, but he wasn't darting at us or anything.'' But it could not stay in the East Village, either, because Mr. Shapiro does not have an alligator permit.</p>
        <p>So by nightfall, the gator was back in a car, on its way to a licensed alligator keeper in Greentown, Pa.</p>
        <p>''Animals need to be basking in the sun,'' Mr. Shapiro said.</p>
