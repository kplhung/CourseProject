        <p>The federal authorities today arrested a former high-ranking civilian employee of the Army on espionage charges and accused him of providing highly classified documents to the Soviet Union over a period of at least 25 years.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said the 73-year-old former employee, George Trofimoff, a naturalized American citizen whose parents were Russian emigres, was arrested at a hotel in Tampa, Fla., and charged with passing the documents to a childhood friend, a prominent Russian Orthodox priest who had recruited him for the K.G.B.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trofimoff, who worked as a civilian at the Joint Interrogation Center in Nuremberg, Germany, had access to ''all classified information'' at the center, which debriefed East bloc defectors and refugees and processed highly sensitive American intelligence, the prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>From 1969 to 1994, Mr. Trofimoff served as chief of the center's United States Army Element, where he had access to documents outlining American knowledge of the military capabilities and size of Soviet armed forces and the Warsaw Pact, according to the indictment.</p>
        <p>Donna Bucella, the United States attorney for the Middle District of Florida, said Mr. Trofimoff photographed documents and passed them on to his friend, the Rev. Igor Vladimirovich Susemihl, who went on to become the archbishop of Vienna. The K.G.B., the Soviet secret police, made regular payments to Mr. Trofimoff and even provided bonuses, Ms. Bucella said.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Ms. Bucella declined to estimate the damage wrought by the suspected conspiracy, which resulted in 32 separate criminal charges against Mr. Trofimoff. Archbishop Susemihl died last year in Munich.</p>
        <p>But several factors suggested a major security breach, including the sensitivity of the Nuremberg center, a NATO facility staffed by Germans, British, French and Americans; Mr. Trofimoff's clearance to view virtually any documents, and his longevity in the job.</p>
        <p>''This was going on for 25 years,'' Ms. Bucella said.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers were briefed on the case by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Asked for a damage assessment, one Senate aide said the end of the cold war and the dissolution of the Soviet Union made the accusations against Mr. Trofimoff less troubling.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's that bad, because it's cold war stuff -- we're not really in that game anymore,'' said the aide, who refused to be identified by name. ''I'd say it was very bad at the time. If he's convicted, he's never going to see the light of day again.''</p>
        <p>But the aide acknowledged that a spy in Mr. Trofimoff's position ''would have access to disposition of U.S. forces and what we know about the Russian forces -- it's likely he was able to compromise our sources in the East.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Trofimoff had been living in a military community in Melbourne, Fla., where he settled after his retirement in 1995. His former position as a colonel in the Army Reserve qualified him to buy a $121,550 house in the community, which is exclusively for current and retired military personnel and their families.</p>
        <p>John Callaway, who lives five doors from Mr. Trofimoff, said the charges against his neighbor were ''hard to believe.''</p>
        <p>''They're just lovely people, that's all I know,'' Mr. Callaway, a former Navy captain, said of Mr. Trofimoff and his wife, Jutta.</p>
        <p>Mr. Callaway said the Trofimoffs worked in menial jobs to keep busy. ''He works at a Publix to fill his spare time, as a bag boy,'' Mr. Callaway said, referring to a Florida supermarket chain. ''His wife works in a beauty shop. Other than that, they're no different from anybody else.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Trofimoff's arrest capped a seven-year investigation that was led by the F.B.I. and the Army and involved the assistance of the German authorities, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bucella, the United States attorney, declined to say what led investigators to focus on Mr. Trofimoff at least six years after the last alleged incident of spying. But she said Mr. Trofimoff was seeking payment for espionage activities when he was arrested.</p>
        <p>Army officials failed to provide even rudimentary information about Mr. Trofimoff and his career. A spokeswoman, Elaine Kanellis, said his records had been removed by Army security agents.</p>
        <p>But the indictment against Mr. Trofimoff provided an intriguing glimpse into Soviet spy tactics and the K.G.B.'s use of religious leaders to run agents.</p>
        <p>During the Soviet regime, the Russian Orthodox Church was heavily influenced by the K.G.B.'s committee for religious affairs. Although the church maintained some independence, the committee signed off on the ordination of priests, selected bishops and kept tight vigilance over church activities.</p>
        <p>According to the indictment, Mr. Trofimoff was born in Germany to Russian parents. Archbishop Susemihl, a childhood friend known as Iriney who was also the child of Russian emigres, was so close they considered each other brothers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trofimoff became an American citizen in 1951, and served in the Army before joining the Army Reserve in the 1950's.</p>
        <p>Sometime around 1969, when Mr. Trofimoff began work at the Nuremberg interrogation center, ''Mr. Susemihl recruited him into the service of the K.G.B.,'' the indictment said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trofimoff began removing classified documents from his office and secretly photographing others, and passed the materials on to his priest friend or to K.G.B. officers. Mr. Trofimoff was cautious, on one occasion returning a K.G.B.-recommended camera to his friend because it was ''too dangerous to have,'' the indictment said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trofimoff traveled frequently to Austria, where he met with his priest friend and other known K.G.B.  operatives, the indictment said. Mr. Trofimoff was paid in cash by the priest and others. On one occasion, the indictment said, he received about 90,000 German marks, or about $44,000 at current exchange rates.</p>
        <p>The suspected conspiracy came close to collapsing in December 1994, when Mr. Trofimoff and his friend were arrested in Germany on espionage charges. The pair apparently went because free because the German authorities were unable to demonstrate that espionage had taken place within the previous five years, leaving the case outside Germany's statute of limitations.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bucella noted that United States law has no statute of limitations for spying. Mr. Trofimoff will be prosecuted as a civilian -- not in a military court -- because the activities for which he is charged took place in the context of his civilian job, she said. He is scheduled for a detention hearing next Tuesday.</p>
