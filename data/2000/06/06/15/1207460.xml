        <p>There are many collections of science fiction stories, and work by black writers is sparse in them at best, but next month a book that will doubtless energize some talk in the speculative fiction business and among fans of the genre will be in bookstores. It is an anthology of science and fantasy fiction by black writers, and its potential importance goes beyond its modest first printing of 12,000 copies.</p>
        <p>Science and fantasy fiction is one of the most popular genres in book publishing. But very few blacks write it, although, some people in publishing say, it seems to be attracting a slowly increasing number of black readers. Which makes the arrival of this anthology all the more interesting since it might well build on that trend by introducing more black readers to a body of work some may not have known existed. In short, it signals that this genre -- which many blacks thought had nothing to offer them culturally -- has a rich repository of fine black writers and African characters, stories and sensibilities. Moreover, it will encourage young black writers to try that creatively extravagant and commercially advantageous fiction form. (Science fiction might be possible, i.e., time travel; fantasy fiction is impossible, i.e., the movement of continents of people from one part of the earth to another, or the menace of dragons. They are grouped together as speculative fiction.)</p>

        <p>There are many collections of science fiction stories, and work by black writers is sparse in them at best, but next month a book that will doubtless energize some talk in the speculative fiction business and among fans of the genre will be in bookstores. It is an anthology of science and fantasy fiction by black writers, and its potential importance goes beyond its modest first printing of 12,000 copies.</p>
        <p>Science and fantasy fiction is one of the most popular genres in book publishing. But very few blacks write it, although, some people in publishing say, it seems to be attracting a slowly increasing number of black readers. Which makes the arrival of this anthology all the more interesting since it might well build on that trend by introducing more black readers to a body of work some may not have known existed. In short, it signals that this genre -- which many blacks thought had nothing to offer them culturally -- has a rich repository of fine black writers and African characters, stories and sensibilities. Moreover, it will encourage young black writers to try that creatively extravagant and commercially advantageous fiction form. (Science fiction might be possible, i.e., time travel; fantasy fiction is impossible, i.e., the movement of continents of people from one part of the earth to another, or the menace of dragons. They are grouped together as speculative fiction.)</p>
        <p>The anthology is titled ''Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction From the African Diaspora'' (Warner Books), compiled and edited by a 27-year-old freelance writer, Sheree R. Thomas, who is black.</p>
        <p>Like many good book titles, this one has more than one meaning. ''Dark matter'' in astronomy makes up most of the mass of the universe but is undetectable except by the effects of its gravity.</p>
        <p>''Like dark matter,'' Ms. Thomas wrote in the introduction to her book, ''the contributions of black writers to the genre have not been directly observed or fully explored.'' And in an interview she gave the title a third meaning: ''When I think in general of the black experience here, blacks are like dark matter. They've always been in this country, but yet there's been a conscientious effort not to see our contribution.''</p>
        <p>The very expansiveness of science and fantasy fiction, the hodgepodge of characters real and unreal, Earth and alien, can make it colorblind and race-blind. For instance, James Killen, an African-American who is the science fiction buyer for the Barnes &amp; Noble chain, said that he started reading science fiction by Samuel R. Delany ''when I was in junior high school, and it wasn't until much later that I realized he was black.'' ''It's a form of fiction that says the sky's the limit; open to the what-ifs. The science fiction audience will find 'Dark Matter'; I want the book to find an audience that will say let's try it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Delany is one of the masters of current science fiction, as is Octavia C. Butler, whose work also is in ''Dark Matter'' and who won last year's Nebula Award, her second, from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America for her novel ''Parable of the Talents'' (Seven Stories). Ms. Butler also has two Hugos, awarded by the World Science Fiction Convention.</p>
        <p>Science and fantasy fiction create worlds that are open to people's dreams. Steven Barnes, a popular African-American writer of vivid-action science fiction (his last novel, ''Iron Shadows,'' was published in 1998 by Tor), put it this way: the genre is ''about myth making, about what life is and about what mating is. Blacks in American had their myths created by a dominating group that didn't necessarily wish them well. To black people, this wasn't me. Science fiction opened the door for me to make my dreams for the world.'' In his next novel, for Warner Books, he explores this what-if: Alexander the Great doesn't die young but instead becomes the Pharaoh of Egypt and breaks the control of Rome over its empire, and Africa rises up and conquers Europe.</p>
        <p>Ms. Butler said: ''People have called my work grim, and it is sometimes, but each work always ends with real hope. People are not silly to hope but have good reason to hope, and I advise students that if you don't see what you want out there, then go and write about it and create what you want.'' The hope that one can bring to the writing that should make science fiction attractive to black writers and readers, she said.</p>
        <p>Paul Levinson, president of the 1,500-member Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, said that sometime in the early 1990's African-Americans began reading more science fiction precisely for the reason given by Ms. Butler -- ''it's the literature of hope and liberation, and this resonates with black Americans because it speaks positively to worlds that are different than the ones that sometimes have marginalized them.''</p>
        <p>So if all this is true, why aren't more black writers stretching their careers to science fiction, since blacks are prominent and successful in every other genre, from romances to detective fiction to literary novels? When the question was asked of a sampling of writers and editors and retailers, no one had an answer. Janet Hill, a black editor at Doubleday who specializes in black issues, said of the new anthology: ''When I was young I read a lot of mystery novels, but when I got older I wanted to see myself in the books I was reading. I gravitated toward Delany and Butler. Butler created a world where there were African-Americans, so it wasn't as if there wasn't anything out there. Perhaps this book will open the way for more.''</p>
        <p>A young black writer, Nisi Shawl, said: ''If you are black and a woman, you can look around you and see a lot of bad things happening to good people. Science fiction and fantasy fiction offer possibilities for your imagination; you can open a vista of possibilities of good things happening.''</p>
