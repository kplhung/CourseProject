        <p>Though their days were embittered by segregation and prejudice, African-Americans in Jazz Age New York always suspected that life was sweeter on Sugar Hill.</p>
        <p>As they gazed up the hill from ''the valley,'' as central Harlem was sometimes called, Harlemites saw a shimmering bluff that would, from 1929 until midcentury, become a hub of elite black society. The names of those who lived there read like a Who's Who of black history: Ralph Ellison, Thurgood Marshall, Joe Louis, W. E. B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, Adam Clayton Powell Sr., Zora Neale Hurston, Duke Ellington and Paul Robeson, to name a few.</p>
        <p>Now, some seven decades after the grand 19th-century row houses, brownstones and apartment buildings on Sugar Hill were first opened up to black renters and home buyers, the neighborhood is expected to become an official historic landmark on June 27, when the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designates a section as the Hamilton Heights/Sugar Hill Historic District.</p>
        <p>This is the first phase of a process that will ultimately create a historic district encompassing almost 400 buildings from 145th Street to 155th Street, with jagged borders from Edgecombe Avenue to Amsterdam Avenue. The next phase is expected to begin in July, and the commission hopes the whole district will be designated as a landmark by June 2001.</p>
        <p>One might expect that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has said that he is looking to improve his relations with the city's minority residents, would be shouting from the rooftops about the landmark designation. Not so. In fact, the commission chairwoman he appointed in 1994, Jennifer J. Raab, who is widely credited with pushing through the designation after almost 15 years of inactivity on the issue, is reluctant to call the district a ''black district.''</p>
        <p>''It has a phenomenal volume of perfectly preserved row houses,'' Ms. Raab said. ''They have their stoops, their ornaments, and it is remarkable in New York to find such a volume of intact architecture.''</p>
        <p>But when asked whether she considers Hamilton Heights and Sugar Hill a black historic district, Ms. Raab said, ''I will have to think about that question.''</p>
        <p>Landmark designation is always a subject of debates, and talking about race in any context is touchy. Landmarks officials seem to be particularly wary of combining the two. They may be sensitive, in part, because of previous accusations by some preservationists that the commission has neglected Harlem since it designated the Hamilton Heights Historic District, just south of the new district, in 1974.</p>
        <p>Once the commission finally began carving out the new district in an area almost consecrated in black lore, the debates became more complicated: Should a historic district be created based on its architectural merits or on its cultural history?</p>
        <p>This question is not unique to New York. In other cities where ''heritage tourism'' is encouraged in historic areas like Bronzeville in Chicago's South Side and Beale Street in Memphis, preservationists have also encountered difficulty in convincing officials to define these areas as ''black historic districts.''</p>
        <p>Although Hamilton Heights/Sugar Hill will be one of the largest such districts in the nation when it is completed, it has not been a simple matter to trumpet it that way.</p>
        <p>Most of the historic row houses on the hill were designed for rich white families at the turn of the century. It was not until the end of the 1920's -- late in the Harlem Renaissance -- that blacks were allowed to buy and rent the palatial homes.</p>
        <p>''Whatever the commission calls it, there's no question that we're into a celebration of revolutionary terrain, because this is the central launching pad for black leadership in postwar America,'' said Carolyn Kent, a chairwoman of the landmarks committee for Community Board 9 in West Harlem, which encompasses the historic district.</p>
        <p>Yet today, African-Americans are not the only ones living on the hill, as more homes are owned or rented by Hispanic, Asian, West African and white people.</p>
        <p>''We look at it as a black district historically, but how can we say that now?'' said George Goodwill, chairman of the community board. ''It's tricky and it could become quite confrontational. I try to stay away from controversy and let the name Sugar Hill speak for itself.''</p>
        <p>Julie Mayangar says she was the only white person living on West 147th Street between Convent and St. Nicholas Avenues in 1988, when she bought a four-story brownstone for $300,000. She knew something about the area's cultural history at the time, but moved in because of its well-preserved homes and the prevailing sense of neighborhood pride.</p>
        <p>''For the architectural reasons we want to keep it that way, not just the cultural reasons,'' she said, adding that two mixed-race couples recently moved onto her block.</p>
        <p>Since the Landmarks Preservation Commission was created in 1965, it has designated about 1,000 individual landmarks and about 70 historic districts. According to the commission's spokeswoman, Terri Rosen Deutsch, cultural factors ''drove the designations'' for a few sites in the city, like the recently designated Charlie Parker house on Avenue B. But, she added, ''I don't think there's any building that you can look at that we designated solely for cultural reasons. They all have some architectural merit.''</p>
        <p>But there is an increasingly vocal group of preservationists throughout the city who would like to change that. One is Laura Hansen, a director of Place Matters, a joint project of the Municipal Art Society and City Lore, a cultural organization.</p>
        <p>She said it is sometimes hard to make the argument for cultural designations. ''It's a lot easier to interpret how to regulate something with architectural details, simply because there's a lot of consensus in the architectural canon,'' she said. ''But with cultural history, there's a lot less agreement about what should be included.''</p>
        <p>Yuien M. Chin, coordinator of the Hamilton Heights/Sugar Hill Historic District Committee, said Sugar Hill was a test case. ''It has presented a unique opportunity for the commission to really grapple with the idea of cultural landmarking,'' she said. ''It is an issue that is not unique to Harlem, but it's really important here because it is one of the largest African-American communities that has made such an impact on the history of its people, and it should be acknowledged as such.''</p>
        <p>Some preservationists who argue this point say historic districts like Greenwich Village and South Street Seaport are de facto white historic districts.</p>
        <p>A loose-knit group of Sugar Hill residents first introduced the idea of creating a landmark district there about 15 years ago, but the commission lost their documentation, Mr. Goodwill of the community board said. In 1994, when Ms. Raab became chairwoman, she announced that one of her top priorities was Harlem; three years later, a new group of  residents formed a committee to push again for a historic district.</p>
        <p>In the early planning stages, the commission focused on the exquisite row houses on the side streets, but was skeptical about including several large, more modern apartment buildings on Edgecombe Avenue. To some neighborhood historians, the idea of forsaking Edgecombe was unfathomable. The street sits on the cliff above central Harlem, and the long stretch of towering apartment buildings, many residents argued at commission hearings, were like the gates of the Emerald City.</p>
        <p>''Edgecombe Avenue is synonymous with Sugar Hill,'' Ms. Chin said. ''It was the first place that people think of when you mention Sugar Hill.''</p>
        <p>At first, the commission wanted to include three buildings on the avenue. But when neighborhood advocates argued for the cultural significance of the buildings, the commission added more, leading some preservationists, like Ms. Hansen, to think that the idea of designating cultural landmarks had gained some currency. In the end, eight Edgecombe buildings were included. But there are still two more that preservationists feel should be added: the Park Lincoln and the Florence Mills.</p>
        <p>''These were the first buildings where African-Americans could rent on the hill,'' explained Michael Henry Adams, a preservationist. ''One of the things they did to attract black tenants was to give them welcoming names: Lincoln, the great liberator, and then Florence Mills, the performer who lived in Harlem.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Raab said she is satisfied with the current district lines, but added, ''It's very much like other district processes; we will go back and look at the boundaries.''</p>
        <p>Eleanor Eastman has lived on West 147th Street, in the center of the proposed district, since 1964. She and her former husband bought a four-story row house for just $18,500, in a neighborhood where similar homes have recently sold for $500,000 to $800,000. It is preserved almost exactly as it was 100 years ago. There is a turquoise stained-glass window between the grand staircase and the enormous dining room on the first floor; fireplaces inlaid with Italian marble are in every room; and there is a dumbwaiter to transport food from the downstairs kitchen.</p>
        <p>When she moved in 36 years ago, she said, most of the neighboring homes had been chopped up into rooming houses, and gangs and crime plagued the area. But since the early 1990's she has seen many professionals return and begin restoring the properties.</p>
        <p>''I think landmarking will help people have pride in what they have,'' Ms. Eastman said, ''and the services will get better because it will be a place the whole city can be proud of.''</p>
        <p>But some people are dissatisfied.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams, the commission's most vocal critic, said that the landmarking was ''too little, too late'' because Harlem buildings like the original Cotton Club and the Harlem Opera House have already been torn down.</p>
        <p>Others oppose the designation because they think it will limit their ability to change their homes. ''Landmarks wants to keep everything exactly as it used to be,'' Ms. Mayangar said. ''I think one can be a little eclectic and still keep the building tasteful and beautiful.''</p>
        <p>But most of the neighborhood's residents are pleased and grateful.</p>
        <p>''This was an effort that started 15 years ago and languished at the community board and at the commission for 15 years,'' Ms. Chin said. ''It was Jennifer Raab who finally pushed it through.''</p>
        <p>Christabel Gough, secretary of the Society for the Architecture of the City, a nonprofit group that monitors the Landmarks Commission, said Harlem has long been an ''underrepresented area.''</p>
        <p>''We're delighted to see that it's picking up again,'' she said. ''They're going to designate it on architectural grounds, but it just happens to be a place that is tremendously important in African-American history. So, why not call it that?''</p>
