        <p>Two large agencies are acquiring or taking equity stakes in other concerns.</p>
        <p>The Cordiant Communications Group in London is acquiring PSD Associates in London, a brand consultancy and design agency with 70 employees who work for clients like Swatch.</p>
        <p>Cordiant said it would initially issue 4.88 million new shares -- worth about $22 million -- for the acquisition. The total payment in new Cordiant shares could rise to as much as $52.8 million if profit-based performance targets are met through the end of 2003, Cordiant said.</p>
        <p>And WPP.com in London and New York, part of the WPP Group that includes interactive agencies, companies and services, is taking a minority stake in five Internet-related agencies and companies, for a total cash investment of $16 million.</p>
        <p>They are: Big Words in San Francisco, a Web site geared to college students; Imagine in Rehovot, Israel, which offers electronic customer-relationship management software; Metapack in London, which builds, designs and manages online logistics services; Red Sheriff in Sydney, an Internet-based measurement and market research company; and Spydre Labs in Miami, an online venture capital and incubator company. WPP is taking a stake of about 25 percent in Spydre and less than 20 percent in the other companies.</p>
