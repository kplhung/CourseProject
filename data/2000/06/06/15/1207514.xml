        <p>In the old days, Anthony Pollina, a Progressive Party candidate for governor of Vermont, could have expected to spend his campaign either holding out his hand for money or relegated to the fringe.</p>
        <p>No longer. Today, under the state's new law providing public financing for statewide campaigns, Mr. Pollina announced that he had just qualified for nearly $300,000 in state money, more than the incumbent Democratic governor, Howard Dean, will get.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pollina thus became the first candidate in the country who has qualified for full public financing to run for a statewide post. He also became, he said, a fine example of how elections can change under the ''clean money'' campaign finance overhauls that have passed in Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts and Arizona.</p>
        <p>''While I've been involved in policy making for 20 years -- grass-roots organizing and coalition building -- I have no desire to spend huge amounts of time and energy raising huge amounts of money,'' Mr. Pollina said. ''If that's what the campaign was all about, I would not have had the stomach to do that. Whereas, under the new rules, I've been able to get out and talk to average Vermonters about the concerns we have and the vision we share, and then I ask them for a very small amount of money.''</p>
        <p>Under the new campaign finance law that took effect this election cycle, Mr. Pollina had only to raise contributions of $50 or less from 1,500 Vermont voters around the state. (Some donations were as small as 50 cents, he said.) The contributions had to amount to at least $35,000, and to be gathered in the five-month period from February to July. The state will now give him enough public money to reach a $300,000 total campaign budget, which he said he would spend largely on canvassing and door-to-door work, as well as on staff and paid advertisements.</p>
        <p>Governor Dean, who signed the campaign finance overhaul into law after the Legislature passed it in 1997, is also gathering the small contributions needed to qualify for public financing. But the law, intending to offset the advantages of incumbency, allows him a budget of only $255,000.</p>
        <p>Two other contenders, both Republicans, are running for governor. One, Ruth Dwyer, a farmer and former Republican nominee for governor, has said she will not use the public financing option, but will raise her campaign money herself. The other, Bill Meub, a lawyer, former dairy farmer and former bacteriologist for the New York City Health Department, is trying to gather the public financing contributions.</p>
        <p>The course of the campaign could suddenly change, however. Several aspects of the Vermont law are being challenged in court, including its overall spending cap of $300,000 for candidates for governor and its limits on out-of-state contributions. It could be overturned in the coming weeks, in time to affect the current campaigns.</p>
        <p>''Someone like Anthony Pollina and others who have not in the past had access to large sums of money are able to enter into this process because of this law, and it only bodes well for Vermont's democracy,'' said John C. Bonifaz, executive director of the National Voting Rights Institute, a nonprofit group specializing in campaign finance litigation.</p>
        <p>Whatever the law means for Vermont's democracy, it means a tougher-than-usual race for Governor Dean, though a recent poll showed him comfortably in the lead.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dean, a physician, said today that he believed in the law but was finding himself squeezed from the left by Mr. Pollina on the liberal side and from the right by Ms. Dwyer, who, if the law is overturned, may suddenly be able to spend as much money as she can raise. (An early poll showed Mr. Pollina with only about 5 percent of the public supporting him, but he pointed out that it was taken before he began campaigning.)</p>
        <p>Add to the mix the criticism of Dr. Dean from some quarters for signing a bill allowing marriagelike ''civil unions'' for gay couples, and it is clear why he is sounding unusually nervous.</p>
        <p>''The whole thing is pretty tough,'' Dr. Dean, who has held his post since 1991, said of running under the clean money strictures, ''but it's the right thing to do.''</p>
