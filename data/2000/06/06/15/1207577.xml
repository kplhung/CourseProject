        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I enjoyed reading about the Psion Series 7 with its EPOC operating system. I am writing this on a five-pound portable with an 8.5-inch TFT screen, a small but decent keyboard and a small but O.K. hard drive. The computer is five years old, but still capable, Toshiba Portege. The computer came to me used and refurbished and was very inexpensive. Windows runs slowly on it, but I am not running Windows on it very much. I am running programs written to run in DOS.</p>

        <p>For the time being, I am content to carry this computer around with me in the same way my friends carry P.D.A.'s. The only difference is that I have to carry a bit more weight (bad) and I can use Word Perfect 6 for DOS, a great writing program and totally compatible with Word Perfect For Windows (very good).</p>
