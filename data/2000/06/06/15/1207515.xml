        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>GORE PROSPERS IN NEW YORK -- Vice President Al Gore is giving a double meaning to his current ''prosperity tour,'' collecting a cool million in New York last night. After opening his ''progress and prosperity tour'' in New York on Tuesday, Mr. Gore headed for Scranton, Pa., then swooped back into Manhattan last night for two dinners on the Upper East Side for the Democratic National Committee before resuming his tour today in Cincinnati. Unlike Pennsylvania and Ohio, however, New York is perceived as squarely in Mr. Gore's corner and is a reliable source of campaign cash. The vice president stopped first at the Park Avenue home of Alan J. Patricof, a financier, where 40 people paid $12,500 each for a total take of $500,000. At the next stop, the 90th Street home of Mitchell Blutt, a doctor and venture capitalist, 50 people paid $10,000 each, also yielding $500,000. At Mr. Patricof's apartment, Mr. Gore praised his listeners, many of whom had supported President Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and had been contributing to the Democratic Party ever since. The vice president thanked them for ''being a constant source of good common-sense advice on how to pursue progressive values in a way that would ensure economic strength, build the economy and lift up the people who most need the benefits of good policy.''</p>

        <p>NEW ROLE FOR GORE AIDE -- One of Vice President Al Gore's top consultants, Tad Devine, is shifting into a more central role in Nashville, where he will be spending several days a week. Mr. Devine, 45, a partner with Bob Shrum, Mr. Gore's media adviser, has periodically been deployed to Nashville from Washington as a trouble-shooter at crucial moments, such as early this year in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, and last fall when Mr. Gore was angling for the endorsement of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Mr. Devine has a reputation for being a fierce campaigner, but he is also perceived as a mediator among some of the factions that have developed within the Gore campaign. Meanwhile, Tony Coelho, the Gore campaign chairman, was admitted Monday night to a hospital in Washington, where doctors found he had an inflamed colon. He was expected to be released soon.</p>

        <p>THE HOUSE</p>
        <p>SOUTHERN PRIMARY RESULTS -- The lineups for Congressional races across the South were set in primaries on Tuesday. In Virginia's Seventh Congressional District, anchored in the Richmond suburbs, Eric L. Cantor of Henrico, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, defeated State Senator Stephen H. Martin of Chesterfield for the Republican nomination by only 197 votes, out of 41,539 cast. Mr. Cantor will face Warren Stewart, a Democrat who is school superintendent of Goochland County in a race to fill the seat of Representative Thomas J. Bliley, a Republican who is retiring after 20 years. In other primaries on Tuesday, Henry Brown, a South Carolina state representative, defeated H. B. Limehouse, a former state transportation chairman, for the Republican nomination for the seat now held by Representative Mark Sanford, a Republican who is retiring to keep his campaign pledge to serve only three terms. Mr. Brown will oppose Andy Brack, the Democrat who is a former journalist and spokesman for Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina. In a heavily Republican district where South Carolina Democrats declined to nominate a candidate, Jim DeMint, a freshman representative, assured his House re-election by defeating Frank Raddish in the Republican primary. In Arkansas, State Senator Mike Ross defeated Dewayne Graham, a former television reporter, for the Democratic nomination and will face Representative Jay Dickey, a Republican seeking his fourth term.</p>

        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>DEBATING FOR CHARITY -- The billionaire financier Theodore J. Forstmann announced yesterday that he would donate a total of $1 million to children's charities if Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas agreed to participate in a 90-minute televised debate on education. Mr. Forstmann, a critic of public education who co-founded the Children's Scholarship Fund, which sends children from poor families to private schools, said he sent invitation letters to each candidate on June 13, but had yet to hear from either one. ''If we are to see the day in which every single child in America has equal opportunity in education,'' Mr. Forstmann said at a news conference at the New York Press Club, ''then we must face up to the failure of our current model of education to provide it.'' Mr. Gore told reporters today that he would accept Mr. Forstmann's proposal, although he seemed a bit insulted that money was attached to it. ''Nobody has to give money to get me to debate,'' he said in response to a question from reporters as he campaigned today in Scranton, Pa. Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said, ''The governor looks forward to debating on education this fall since education is his top domestic priority, but as to this specific invitation, we have not had an opportunity to review it yet.''</p>

        <p>THE SOUTH</p>
        <p>GAY PROSECUTOR DEFEATED -- The only openly gay Republican officeholder in the South lost that designation on Tuesday. David Schwacke, the solicitor, or chief prosecutor, in Charleston, S.C., was narrowly defeated in a Republican primary by Ralph Hoisington, a lawyer whose campaign slogan was ''For our families.'' Mr. Hoisington won by only 265 votes out of 29,421 cast, a margin so small that it will automatically trigger a recount. Mr. Schwacke was seeking re-election for the first time since making his homosexuality public three years ago. He did so after local Republican officials asked the state police to investigate accusations that Mr. Schwacke had downloaded pornography on his office computer. He was cleared of any wrongdoing. Mr. Hoisington outspent Mr. Schwacke by nearly 4 to 1 and ran television advertisements vowing to get tough on child molesters.</p>

        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>NURSES UNION BACKS NADER -- Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate running for president on the Green Party line, has picked up the endorsement of a major nurses union in California, where his candidacy could have an impact on who wins the state in the general election. The California Nurses Association, a 31,000-member union based in Oakland, praised Mr. Nader for what it called his commitment to universal health care, patients' rights and expanded federal health insurance.</p>
