        <p>Prosecutors have charged dozens of people with using stock manipulation, fraud and violence to steal from thousands of investors across the country in a scheme that federal authorities are calling one of organized crime's most aggressive forays into the stock market.</p>
        <p>The authorities said their investigation swept up one high-ranking member and several lower-level members of New York's organized-crime families, as well as brokers, stock promoters and a retired police officer who served as treasurer of the New York City detectives union.</p>
        <p>At the center of the investigation is a Manhattan investment firm, DMN Capital Investments, which prosecutors said was infiltrated by mob associates and eventually became a creature of their attempts to defraud investors. In an indictment filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, prosecutors charged 21 people with conducting a racketeering enterprise based at DMN.</p>
        <p>''It was an investment bank to the crooked and corrupt,'' United States Attorney Mary Jo White said at a news conference yesterday. ''DMN was fraud central.''</p>
        <p>Federal agents charged that the defendants used a range of schemes to defraud investors, from running traditional high-pressure boiler-room sales operations to bribing brokers and creating phony stock trades. Such tactics would artificially inflate the price of stocks, which could then be sold at an illicit profit, the indictment said. Not all the schemes were directly related, prosecutors said. They said federal agents learned of the other cases through their investigation of DMN, which began over a year ago.</p>
        <p>The indictment charged that the DMN conspirators used organized- crime ties to ''instill fear in brokers and other market participants who did business with the enterprise.'' Prosecutors charged that members of the conspiracy used beatings and threats to ensure that brokers and stock promoters followed through on promises to cooperate with the fraud in exchange for bribes.</p>
        <p>''No matter what market the mob tried to infiltrate, from the fish market to the stock market, the methods it uses are always the same: violence and the threat of violence,'' said Barry W. Mawn, assistant director in charge of the New York F.B.I. office.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors estimated that the fraud cost investors about $50 million, though they said millions of dollars more would have been lost if the investigation had not stopped a number of frauds before they could come to fruition. The prosecutors estimated that about $25 million of the losses was tied to organized- crime members or associates.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors charged that the defendants involved with DMN used a twist that has long been a feature of organized crime: bribing union officials to allow them to use large union funds for the scheme. They charged that the treasurer of the Detectives Endowment Association of New York agreed to use his influence to invest union money in a fraudulent investment. Prosecutors said the official, Stephen E. Gardell, who recently retired, had agreed to accept kickbacks in exchange for his participation.</p>
        <p>Detective Gardell, 52, is also accused of using his police contacts to provide confidential information to organized-crime members. Federal prosecutors said that he had passed along confidential information about continuing investigations, influenced a city police investigation into one of the conspirators, assisted in obtaining firearms permits for organized- crime members and provided law enforcement parking permits to organized-crime members. In return, they said, Detective Gardell received cash and property including money for a new pool at his house, rooms and meals at casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, and a fur coat.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said the scheme to use the detectives union money was never carried out and the union never lost any money. Yesterday afternoon, Detective Thomas J. Scotto, the union president, said that Detective Gardell never approached the union's officers about investing union money in any companies named in the charges. He said the union, which only invests in large, established companies, would have rejected the suggestion if it had been made. Detective Gardell's lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, said yesterday that his client maintained his innocence.</p>
        <p>According to the indictment, the defendants conspired to divert money from the detectives' retirement fund and from another union pension fund to Husic Capital Management, a San Francisco investment firm that  manages $4.5 billion for big companies and pension funds.</p>
        <p>The indictment charged that the chief investment officer of Husic, William Stephens, then planned to use some of the money to buy stock from a company that would kick back 20 percent of the money to the defendants. By skimming from the  members' retirement savings, the defendants could reap millions of dollars in illegal profits, the indictment said.</p>
        <p>By using Husic as an intermediary, the defendants hoped to conceal the skimming, said Richard Walker, enforcement director for the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''This is a very important case from our point of view,'' he added.</p>
        <p>A Husic spokeswoman, Abigail Baker, said the company would cooperate with law enforcement officials and had suspended Mr. Stephens when it learned of his indictment. ''The firm as a whole is completely shocked,'' Ms. Baker said.</p>
        <p>At 6 a.m. yesterday, more than 600 F.B.I. agents began rounding up nearly 100 defendants throughout the city and as far away as Texas, Utah and California. Investigators coordinating their efforts through New York charged 120 people in 16 indictments and 7 criminal complaints. Prosecutors said that 10 of the people charged yesterday were reputed members or associates of organized crime. They said it was the largest number of people ever arrested at one time on stock fraud charges and one of the largest groups ever arrested by the federal government.</p>
        <p>In the last several years, a string of criminal cases has uncovered organized crime's involvement in the stock market, particularly in dealing with securities known as microcap stocks, issued by small, little-known companies. In one 1997 case, organized-crime figures were charged with bribing brokers to fraudulently inflate the value of certain stocks. Earlier this year, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn charged 19 people with stock fraud, including men they said were members of Russian organized crime and a high-ranking member of the Bonanno organized- crime family.</p>
        <p>Federal investigators said, however, that while these cases were a serious blow to organized crime's efforts to infiltrate the stock market, criminal activity was not anywhere near a common presence in the financial world.</p>
        <p>''Today's actions are not an indication that the tentacles of organized crime have reached anywhere beyond the seamy underbelly of the microcap market,'' Mr. Walker of the S.E.C. said. He said the bull market of the last 10 years has lured more sophisticated criminals as it has lulled less-sophisticated investors into a false sense of security.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said they had charged members of each of New York's five organized-crime families in yesterday's case, though they said the fraud was coordinated by the Colombo and Bonanno families.</p>
        <p>In addition to using informants and undercover officers posing as willing participants, prosecutors said federal agents managed to install an eavesdropping device in the office of DMN. Between December 1999 and May 4, agents recorded over 1,000 hours of conversation.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors charged that the members of the DMN operation infiltrated corrupt brokers into several New York area brokerage firms. They said that the members of the conspiracy then used a variety of tactics, like creating phony stock sales and secretly bribing brokers to sell stock to increase its value.</p>
        <p>Ms. White, the United States attorney, said the inquiry was continuing and more arrests were expected.</p>
