        <p>IN front of a modern house that punctuates the expanding faux-chateau district in the north of this city, there is a 3,600-square-foot patch of grass that is challenging some cherished ideas about landscape design, the roles of artists and architects, and the process of looking at art itself. Not to mention the meaning of ''front lawn.''</p>
        <p>This deceptively simple square of green grass is the latest creation of the artist Robert Irwin, best known for his controversial gardens at the Getty Center in Los Angeles. It was made possible by Howard Rachofsky, an investor and respected collector of contemporary art, who has described his Richard Meier house as a museum with a one-bedroom apartment attached. The collection, which will eventually be a public trust and which includes work by current art stars like Marc Quinn and Damien Hirst, has made the house an art-world destination as well as a frequent stop for tours by local schoolchildren.</p>
        <p>By ceding his front lawn to Mr. Irwin -- and by awarding the 72-year-old artist his first private commission -- Mr. Rachofsky is showing that he wants to educate visitors in the art of seeing, deeply and patiently. That is Mr. Irwin's goal as well.</p>
        <p>As you approach the house from busy Preston Road and pass through a slatted aluminum gate designed by Mr. Meier, Mr. Irwin's sculpture, ''Tilted Planes,'' is visible, just barely, centered in the lawn: it is a 60-by-60-foot square of grass, divided equally into four smaller squares that ramp in different directions, each bound by a thin retaining wall of Corten steel. As you venture further up the driveway, the piece begins to play a cat-and-mouse game with your attention, seeming to recede and rear up into view. The lawn tilts, the planes tilt against it, and viewing ''Tilted Planes'' becomes a game of establishing a visual equilibrium, between the landscape it sets in motion and the strong geometry of the house itself.</p>
        <p>The piece transforms the front lawn into a mental playing field. And like many of Mr. Irwin's installations, it is meant to challenge one's perception of a landscape by teasing out a subtle beauty that already exists -- in this case, in the long, gently sloping lawn and the house's gridded porcelain-white rigor.</p>
        <p>One might reasonably ask if the lawn is also a battlefield of two artistic gurus, given the well-documented friction between Mr. Irwin and Mr. Meier. The two were brought together on the celebrated Getty Center in Los Angeles, completed in 1997, a year after the Rachofsky house was built. Mr. Meier, 65, spent 13 years on that giant hilltop keep for the Getty's galleries, making a catalog of the precise, unabashedly modern forms that he has been honing fixedly since the 1970's. Mr. Irwin, whose work is among other things a critique of grandiosity, was brought in midway to re-imagine Mr. Meier's central gardens. No love was lost between them.</p>
        <p>It was because of the strength of Mr. Meier's composition that the front lawn of the Rachofsky house remained empty for so long as the back and side yards filled up with ecstatic works by Julian Schnabel, Joel Shapiro, Paul McCarthy and many others. The conventional solution, plunking down a self-contained sculpture or a clump of Henry Moores to offset the graph-lined rigidity of the house, was rejected by the owner.</p>
        <p>''There's a difference between a sculpture and an incursion in the landscape,'' Mr. Rachofsky said. ''I wanted the latter.''</p>
        <p>This wish naturally led him to Mr. Irwin, whose best work has responded to specific and often difficult sites, whether installations on college campuses and public plazas or the dozens of galleries -- like the DIA Center for the Arts, on West 22nd Street --  that he has temporarily transformed with his trademark semitransparent white scrim. (A new sculpture by Mr. Irwin will be on view at the PaceWildenstein Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, beginning Monday.)</p>
        <p>After shedding the conventions of painting -- the image, the line, the frame and finally the canvas itself -- in a disciplined evolution from the late 1950's through the 1970's, Mr. Irwin reached a point where, he said, making art was simply a way to amplify some hidden essence he saw in the world, not the dead end of a stylistic or political agenda. His ideal has been to capture the moment of pure perception that sometimes comes when one sees an unfamiliar thing for the first time, or a familiar thing with new eyes: Lawrence Weschler borrowed a phrase from Paul Valery for the title of his 1982 biography of Mr. Irwin, ''Seeing Is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees'' (University of California Press).</p>
        <p>Last summer, Mr. Irwin left San Diego and moved with his wife, Adele, and their daughter, Anna Grace, to a one-story bungalow at the far end of a row of postwar ranches just outside the center of Cornwall-on-Hudson, a small but notoriously artsy Hudson Valley town. He has come east from  his native California to design new exhibition spaces in Beacon, N.Y., for the DIA Center for the Arts, expected to be completed in 2001. The site, an old Nabisco factory on the Hudson, is almost visible out of the window behind Mr. Irwin's drafting table, on the opposite bank.</p>
        <p>Sitting in his ground-floor studio, not far from his own more mundane and daisy-ridden lawn, Mr. Irwin described his impressions of the Rachofsky house's grounds during his first visit, in early 1998.</p>
        <p>''That lawn, slowly going uphill, tilting in two directions, already was subtly sculptural,'' he said. ''All I really wanted to do was activate it.''</p>
        <p>After meditating on the site, he carefully staked out the limits of the piece and checked them from every vantage, outside and inside the house. One result is that ''Tilted Planes,'' though it is set four-square in front of the house, refuses to be captured in full by any of the house's windows. Only fragments are ever visible, from the central picture window in the second-floor living room, from a large corner window in an adjoining library or from the tall windows in the ground-floor gallery, where minimalist works that Mr. Rachofsky calls ''an homage to Irwin'' currently hang.</p>
        <p>That quiet but aggressive gesture -- denying the architecture control of the views it was designed to frame -- pits the house and ''Tilted Planes'' in an exquisite tension. It is also a kind of metaphor for Mr. Irwin's troubled history with Mr. Meier.</p>
        <p>In the 1997 film ''Concert of Wills,'' which documents the creation of the Getty Center, there is a scene in which Mr. Meier, wearing an orange construction vest over his trademark crisp-collared white shirt, looks down from a balcony on the nearly finished J. Paul Getty Museum and sees Mr. Irwin's garden for the first time. ''Unbelievable!'' he says. Then, passing the camera as he storms off, he mutters, ''What a disaster.'' There were other fireworks earlier, at a meeting in 1993 where Mr. Irwin first unveiled the plans for his garden, a long, zagging path down a slope to a pool planted with a maze of glaring azaleas. In the film, Mr. Irwin is heard laughing off camera as Mr. Meier objects to the plan, because parts are sunken and lack city views. When asked to respond, Mr. Irwin offered only a single tart expletive.</p>
        <p>Was Mr. Rachofsky playing the provocateur when he brought Mr. Irwin and Mr. Meier together again just as the dust was settling at the Getty Center?</p>
        <p>''No,'' the collector said as he walked through his hangar of a living room, past Damien Hirst's ''Uncaring Lovers,'' a cabinet with jars of cow and sheep offal that Mr. Rachofsky said represents the travails of a dysfunctional couple. ''In 'Tilted Planes,' the experience of the grid -- Richard's imagery -- becomes reinforced.''</p>
        <p>As one of Mr. Rachofsky's advisers joked, ''It's a little like the second marriage of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, but this time it works.''</p>
        <p>When reached recently at his office in New York, Mr. Meier confirmed that, this time around, he and Mr. Irwin are better housemates. But he also seemed to damn him with faint praise.</p>
        <p>''It looks quite alright,'' he said. ''It's one of his best pieces that I've seen dealing with the landscape.'' He has seen ''Tilted Planes'' only in photographs, however -- he said he learned of the piece only this spring -- so he is reserving the right to assess its full impact on the house. In particular, he was concerned that the Corten, which will rust to an eggplant color, introduces too much dissonance into the lawn, which he considers to be a necessary counterweight  to the intricate forms of the house. ''Had he done it without the steel, it would have been absolutely magnificent,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meier's concern about the Corten is easy to understand. When the light is just right, for instance, the lawn and the chunks of lawn within the piece merge into a single field and disappear. What is left are the angled steel retaining walls, which seem to point their rusty, accusing fingers at the whiter-than-thou house. It is as if Mr. Irwin had smuggled a Tonka truck load of miniature Richard Serras into Mr. Meier's once pristine front lawn -- a politicized reading that Mr. Irwin rejected with a sly smile.</p>
        <p>A second artwork by Mr. Irwin at the Rachofsky House finds undisputed common ground between the artist and the architect. Over the bed in the third-floor master bedroom hangs one of Mr. Irwin's untitled painted disks from the late 1960's. Part of his search for alternatives to framed artwork, the gracefully convex discs were intended to merge imperceptibly with the wall behind them, thus freeing the art to ''activate'' the whole space. In the years since they were made, few locations have been found where this magic trick can occur in natural light; they are usually shown in galleries where spotlights destroy the effect. But in Mr. Rachofsky's white-on-white bedroom, thanks to the sensitive baffling of the light that was part of Mr. Meier's original design, the disk can be seen to do what it is supposed to do -- tease perception by vanishing into the wall, without a shadow, into some realm that exists only in the mysterious traffic between reflected light and the eye of the observer.</p>
