        <p>YOU can't call them book shelves anymore. Books have moved out to make room for CD's, videos, serving dishes, computer disks, office equipment and milk-glass cow heads. The shelving units here made their debuts during the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York last month; they are modular and can expand as the need arises.</p>
        <p>1.  The wall-mounted lacquered-wood storage boxes, made in the Netherlands by UMS-Pastoe, look like a cross between medicine cabinets and wall sculpture. Each unit in the line, called Vision, is sold separately, some with drawers, some with shelves, from $400 to $2,000. The nine units shown total $4,800 at Totem, 71 Franklin Street (Broadway); www.totemdesign.com.</p>
        <p>2.  Ladislav Czernek's Rack and Pinion shelving system is made of maple or mahogany shelves hinged together and supported by ebonized mahogany wall brackets. The configuration shown costs $2,600 and can be ordered from Epoche Studios, 397 Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>3.  Plinto, an Italian system by Former, has cabinets and shelves attached to a lacquered wall panel, and a walnut credenza with drawers. Combinations start at $3,900 at M2L, 979 Third Avenue (to the trade).</p>
        <p>4.  A stackable cupboard system called Piroscafo would be at home in a library, dining room, even a kitchen. The aluminum frame can be laminated with cherry wood or lacquered in white, blue, green or black. The three-tiered lacquered version shown, 95 by 88 inches, is $7,744 at Format, 50 Wooster Street (Broome Street).</p>
        <p>5.  The Tonic grid system by Offi can be customized with drawers, doors and even a desk-table that attaches to the grid to create a work space or dining area. The system comes in walnut or maple; the model shown, 63 inches high, 63 inches wide and 15 inches deep, costs $2,299 in walnut and $1,999 in maple. For store locations: (800) 383-6334 or www.offi.com.</p>
        <p>6.  Listen up, nomads. The Rakks system consists of floor-to-ceiling poles anchored by tension, not screws, and brackets that can be installed without tools. An 8-foot pole is $70; a 9-foot pole is $75; 8-inch brackets are $11 a pair, and a 16-inch pair is $24. You supply your own shelves. The system is available at Mxyplyzyk, 125 Greenwich Avenue (13th Street).</p>
        <p>7.  Translucent Plexiglas doors sit in the vinyl-covered plywood frame of the Cell Tower by G7, 67 inches high by 36 inches wide; $4,500 at Totem.</p>
        <p>8.  Piero Lissoni's plastic containers, 15 inches high, 15 inches deep and 30 inches long, come with or without doors and wheels. Units stack or can be arranged to form a low credenza. In orange, green, blue, black and clear; units are $377 each with doors and wheels, $306 without, at Kartell, 45 Greene Street (Broome Street).</p>
