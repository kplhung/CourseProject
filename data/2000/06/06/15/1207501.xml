        <p>The airline mechanic's predawn chore was simple enough: check the oil on Continental Flight 336 before it left Newark International Airport for Boston today at 6:30 a.m. He turned on the jet's two engines, and in moments, an ordinary preflight routine turned extraordinary.</p>
        <p>The jet, a 140-seat MD-80, bolted forward about 30 feet and its nose punched through an outside wall of Continental's Terminal C and into a small waiting room. No passengers were on the plane or in the waiting room as its big white nose thrust several feet into the room, just past the cockpit's windshield, said Catherine Stengel, a spokeswoman for Continental Airlines.</p>

        <p>The airline mechanic's predawn chore was simple enough: check the oil on Continental Flight 336 before it left Newark International Airport for Boston today at 6:30 a.m. He turned on the jet's two engines, and in moments, an ordinary preflight routine turned extraordinary.</p>
        <p>The jet, a 140-seat MD-80, bolted forward about 30 feet and its nose punched through an outside wall of Continental's Terminal C and into a small waiting room. No passengers were on the plane or in the waiting room as its big white nose thrust several feet into the room, just past the cockpit's windshield, said Catherine Stengel, a spokeswoman for Continental Airlines.</p>
        <p>The mechanic and seven other workers cleaning the interior of the plane were jostled about but not injured in the 4:50 a.m. mishap, Ms. Stengel said.</p>
        <p>No flights were delayed or canceled. The plane missed structural support beams at the end of the terminal wing housing Gates 114 and 115, and the building was not seriously damaged, except for the shattered piece of wall, officials said.</p>
        <p>But the two gates and nearby Gates 112 and 113 were shut throughout the day as investigators for the airline and the Federal Aviation Administration examined the jet and its cockpit equipment, seeking the reasons for an engine power surge strong enough to move a parked jet.</p>
        <p>Continental told the F.A.A. that soon after the engines were turned on, they ''went to takeoff power,'' enabling the plane to move, said Arlene Salac, an agency spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>An F.A.A. official and another aviation expert, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they considered it unlikely that the jet would bolt forward unless the two engine throttles in the cockpit were moved, setting the plane in motion.</p>
        <p>Investigators questioned the mechanic, Ms. Stengel said. But she and Ms. Salac would not say what they had learned about any activation of the throttles.</p>
        <p>''We're not releasing any information until the investigation is over, and that will be in two to three weeks,'' Ms. Stengel said.</p>
        <p>She said the engine thrust was powerful enough to allow the plane to move over blocking equipment called chocks, in place at the nose wheel and the wheels under each wing. The plane is equipped with a parking brake that should have been in use during the preflight maintenance, Ms. Stengel said. She would not say whether it had been activated as required by airline policy.</p>
        <p>Ms. Salac said F.A.A. inspectors would investigate Continental's preflight maintenance procedures and establish precisely what the mechanic did before the jet lurched.</p>
