      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>One of the aims of DanceGalaxy, a ballet company founded in 1997 by Judith Fugate and Medhi Bahiri, is to provide opportunities for accomplished dancers who may or may not still be performing with the companies in which they matured as artists. But a program presented by the company on Tuesday night at Marymount Manhattan Theater also gave the audience a chance to catch up on the pursuits of familiar dancers of the immediate past.</p>
        <p>One of two premieres in the program, which will be repeated nightly through Friday at Marymount (221 East 71st Street), was by Ann Marie DeAngelo, a former Joffrey star who is now a choreographer and dance administrator. The excerpt from her new ''Suspended Disbelief,'' to music by Conni Ellisor, is a stormy duet danced to the hilt by Adriana Jacinto and Thaddeus Davis, a guest from Donald Byrd/The Group.</p>

        <p>One of the aims of DanceGalaxy, a ballet company founded in 1997 by Judith Fugate and Medhi Bahiri, is to provide opportunities for accomplished dancers who may or may not still be performing with the companies in which they matured as artists. But a program presented by the company on Tuesday night at Marymount Manhattan Theater also gave the audience a chance to catch up on the pursuits of familiar dancers of the immediate past.</p>
        <p>One of two premieres in the program, which will be repeated nightly through Friday at Marymount (221 East 71st Street), was by Ann Marie DeAngelo, a former Joffrey star who is now a choreographer and dance administrator. The excerpt from her new ''Suspended Disbelief,'' to music by Conni Ellisor, is a stormy duet danced to the hilt by Adriana Jacinto and Thaddeus Davis, a guest from Donald Byrd/The Group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis provides a strong, well-muscled center for Ms. Jacinto, whom he pulls, pushes and even helps to run up a proscenium wall, the dance equivalent of scenery-chewing. Amusingly, the duet recalls the kind of misty romantic pas de deux that was a popular ballet program filler in the 70's, toughened up for our hard-living new millennium.</p>
        <p>Adam Miller's new ''Flow Bear Waltzes'' is better than its cute title. Set to a medley of Paris Bal Musette music, the ballet is a sweeping frolic for four couples, with two gems buried in its flow. One is a playfully tussling little duet for Cheryl Sladkin and Mr. Davis that is filled with unexpected partnering maneuvers. The other, a solo for the impressive Mr. Davis, is a feast of quick-changing dance textures negotiated with a remarkable blend of softness and crisp focus. The cast also included Ms. Jacinto, Karen Lynch, Suzanne Goldman, Francois Petron, Leonard Ajkun and Pascal Benichou.</p>
        <p>Another highlight was Toni Pimble's ''Two's Company,'' set to Dvorak, a trio for a radiant Ms. Goldman and two would-be lovers, a tumultuous Mr. Benichou and the quietly eloquent Donald Williams, a guest from Dance Theater of Harlem. There was not a wasted, static moment in this vibrant piece.</p>
        <p>The program was completed by Daniel Levans's ''Canciones Amatorias,'' a pretty ballet group work to music by Granados that needed a bigger stage, and the pas de deux from Balanchine's ''Diamonds.'' Veronica Lynn's expansive, light-filled dancing cried out for a better partner than Nils Bertil Wallin.</p>
