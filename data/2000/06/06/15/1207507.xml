        <p>Bass P.L.C., one of Britain's best-known beer makers, agreed today to sell its 223-year-old brewing business to Interbrew of Belgium for $2.1 billion, getting out of a market of beer-drinking Britons who are becoming more selective about their brews and more moderate in their consumption.</p>
        <p>The sale, plus Interbrew's assumption of about $1.2 billion in Bass debt, will allow the big British brewer to concentrate on building up its faster-growing hotel and pub business. And the privately held Interbrew, which agreed last month to buy the beer business of Whitbread P.L.C., will gain control of almost one-third of the British market, becoming the world's second-largest brewer after Anheuser-Busch.</p>
        <p>The move is driven by a perception among some beer companies that they need a wide array of brands in different countries to remain competitive, analysts said. With its acquisitions, Interbrew, which makes Stella Artois lager, will also take over such barroom stalwarts as Bass Ale and Carling lager, as well as Boddington, a Manchester brew produced by Whitbread. It will broaden its offerings to British drinkers whose per-capita beer ingestion fell 12 percent from 1990 to 1998.</p>
        <p>''There's an enthusiasm to believe that owning brewing assets in two countries is better than just owning them in one,'' said Robert Cumming, an analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. ''They believe it helps your performance in Britain if you are also strong in Belgium.''</p>
        <p>With its successful offer, Interbrew outbid Heineken, South African Breweries P.L.C. and Carlsberg of Denmark. Heineken said through its spokesman, Albert Holtzappel, that it would look for other British deals to play ''an active role in the consolidation of the world beer market.''</p>
        <p>Bass shares rose 3 percent in London today, to $:7.265, or $10.89. Interbrew is not publicly traded, but analysts said its recent deals could make the company more enticing when it issues shares later in the year.</p>
        <p>Bass, which has been connected to the beer industry since 1777 when William Bass started a brewery at Burton-on-Trent, said it expected the sale to generate a net gain of about $2.1 billion. The deal requires the approval of shareholders and of European Union regulators.</p>
        <p>The sale of its brewing business coincides with reports that Bass plans to expand its hotel business, now concentrated in its Holiday Inn and Inter-Continental chains, which the company bought in 1998 for $:1.8 billion, then worth close to $3 billion.</p>
        <p>Investors have worried that Bass overpaid for the chains, but the company said last year that it would continue to invest $600 million a year for the next three years in its global hotel business, with almost 500,000 beds in 2,900 hotels.</p>
        <p>Bass has declined to comment on reports that it is exploring deals with both Whitbread, which operates the Marriott franchise in Britain, and Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, which owns the Sheraton chain.</p>
        <p>Ian Prosser, Bass's chairman and chief executive, said the proceeds of the Interbrew deal would reduce the group's debt and leave it in a position to invest in the global hotel industry. He also said the company would keep the Bass P.L.C. name for at least two years as it sought a new name to denote its shift toward hotel and leisure businesses.</p>
