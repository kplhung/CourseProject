        <p>Vice President Al Gore brought his ''prosperity and progress tour'' to northeastern Pennsylvania today, promoting his plan to protect Medicare and saying he would provide additional money for health care providers that serve Medicare patients.</p>
        <p>But in the process, Mr. Gore also became ensnared in abortion politics as he was forced at the last minute to move his event from a Roman Catholic hospital to a nondenominational health care center after church officials registered concern about Mr. Gore's support for abortion rights.</p>
        <p>Pennsylvania is a crucial battleground between Mr. Gore and his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. It is also home to one of the largest concentrations of elderly people in the country, and Mr. Gore addressed his message today to them.</p>
        <p>With the pending retirement of the baby boom, the number of Americans on Medicare is expected to double to 80 million from 40 million by 2035. Mr. Gore has proposed removing Medicare from the normal budget process so that the money collected from the payroll tax for it is dedicated to the health care program, and is not raided by Congress.</p>
        <p>And he wants to offer a prescription drug benefit under which those on Medicare would receive half of the cost of their drugs, up to $5,000 annually. He said today that for no extra premium, he would provide a catastrophic prescription drug benefit that would cover all drug costs for recipients after they paid $4,000 out of their own pockets. He said that plan would begin in 2002.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also spoke of his commitment to increasing money for biomedical research. And in his zeal to spread a positive, can-do message, he told his audience here at the Allied Services health care center about a conversation he had earlier today with a woman outside a pharmacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said that the woman, in her late 20's or early 30's, told him that her 32-year-old husband had died last month of Lou Gehrig's disease. ''She said, 'I'd like to say something to you. I want you to do everything you can to help our country find a cure for that disease,' '' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>''Well, there's good news,'' Mr. Gore went on. ''Within weeks, an event will take place that is comparable in importance to the landing of the first person on the moon.'' He was referring to the completion of the first phase of the human genome project, which is expected to aid in the treatment of various diseases.</p>
        <p>He said he would double the amount of money devoted to cancer research, adding, ''I'll make it a priority to treat and conquer diseases like Alzheimer's and diabetes, Lou Gehrig's disease, mental illness and H.I.V./AIDS.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also said that too many health care providers had been hurt by excessive budget cuts under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and that he would provide extra money for nursing homes, hospitals, home-health agencies and teaching hospitals.</p>
        <p>He said that he would offer details on how to pay for all of these programs once the new budget surplus numbers were released, perhaps within a couple of weeks. The surplus outside of Social Security, already estimated at between $750 billion and $2 trillion, is expected to grow by a trillion more dollars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's staff had scheduled today's health care forum at Mercy Hospital, run by nuns, in Scranton.</p>
        <p>But at the last minute the local bishop, James C. Timlin, a hospital board member who had been notified by the Scranton chapter of Pennsylvanians for Human Life, said he did not want Mr. Gore, a supporter of abortion rights, using the hospital as a political platform.</p>
        <p>As a result, the Gore campaign switched the event to Allied Services.</p>
        <p>Still, anti-abortion protesters held a candlelight vigil outside Mr. Gore's hotel on Tuesday night and demonstrated today at his speech.</p>
        <p>August Perrotti, 49, a state food inspector who identified himself as a Democrat, was one of those holding signs. Like many voters in this Democratic stronghold in Northeastern Pennsylvania, Mr. Perrotti opposes abortion rights and said he would vote for Mr. Bush because of Mr. Gore's stance. He said he was disappointed that Mr. Gore had abandoned his earlier anti-abortion views and was pleased that ''our bishop stood up for us on this issue.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Republicans today challenged the whole premise of Mr. Gore's ''prosperity and progress tour,'' mocking Mr. Gore by calling it the ''I invented prosperity tour.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Tom Ridge, the Pennsylvania Republican who is under consideration as Mr. Bush's vice-presidential running mate, said in a statement released by the Bush campaign, ''As he travels along on his 'I invented prosperity tour,' I ask him to remember that the credit for our healthy economy belongs to the hard-working men and women of Pennsylvania, not Pennsylvania Avenue.''</p>
        <p>''The vice president can lay no claim on their personal prosperity or professional success,'' Mr. Ridge added.</p>
