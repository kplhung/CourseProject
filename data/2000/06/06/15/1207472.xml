        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Who Gets to Tell a Black Story? A White Journalist Wrote It. A Black Director Fought to Own It'' (''How Race Is Lived in America,'' front page, June 11):</p>
        <p>As a white man from the Middle West and a medical student in the Bronx caring for that community, I empathize with David Simon, the  white journalist who wrote a book about black inner-city drug addicts in Baltimore that became a television series. Mr. Simon may be a sensitive and accurate storyteller, but it does not seem as if this was his story to tell.</p>
        <p>Instead, we should be seeking out the stories of African-American writers who bear eloquent and objective witness to the events and significance of their communities' struggles. They are not only witnesses to this history; they are also survivors of it.</p>
        <p>ANDERS H. BERG  Bronx, June 13, 2000</p>
