        <p>Slouched in the first-base dugout, his baseball cap pulled tight over his brooding brown eyes and his hands tucked in his jacket pockets, Joe Torre always looks as if he is watching paint dry. Torre was watching his Yankees edge the Red Sox, 2-1, at Yankee Stadium yesterday, but he had the look of someone pleased to have selected pink for the bathroom walls.</p>
        <p>Still, Torre sees and senses when something is awry with the Yankees, and he did not like what he saw yesterday morning. He saw a team that trudged into the clubhouse after a loss on Tuesday night and looked tired.

        <p>Slouched in the first-base dugout, his baseball cap pulled tight over his brooding brown eyes and his hands tucked in his jacket pockets, Joe Torre always looks as if he is watching paint dry. Torre was watching his Yankees edge the Red Sox, 2-1, at Yankee Stadium yesterday, but he had the look of someone pleased to have selected pink for the bathroom walls.</p>
        <p>Still, Torre sees and senses when something is awry with the Yankees, and he did not like what he saw yesterday morning. He saw a team that trudged into the clubhouse after a loss on Tuesday night and looked tired. Weary of playing 14 hours after it showed scant energy and weary of wondering if Sammy Sosa or maybe Juan Gonzalez was about to swoop into the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>So Torre called a meeting after batting practice. It was brief. It was really an excuse for Torre to close the clubhouse to the news media. A security guard kept saying the Yankees were meeting, even as players trickled by and said that they were not. Torre violated a Major League Baseball rule on accessibility to give his players one extra half-hour of solitude. By the way, it is the middle of June and the Yankees are in first place.</p>
        <p>''I just kept it closed,'' Torre said. ''We had a meeting. It was more for me than anything. I just wanted to keep it closed to sort of calm everything down. I was asked a couple of times to open it.''</p>
        <p>Torre's intriguing actions were indicative of how much tension has invaded the clubhouse, a place that is usually accustomed to distractions. Pick a season Torre has managed and there were numerous distractions the team overcame to win three of the last four World Series titles, everything from David Cone's aneurysm, to Torre's cancer, to Roger Clemens's arrival to Darryl Strawberry's saga to George Steinbrenner's meddlesome ways.</p>
        <p>But this time it is different because it is Sosa, one of the biggest names in the sport. The splashy potential acquisition does not make enough sense for the Yankees, who could use another pitcher, especially after Clemens lasted one inning because of a strained right groin and is destined for the disabled list.</p>
        <p>The Yankees can win another championship without Sosa, an incredible power hitter who has other limitations and who is not a snug fit at the Stadium. The Yankees are better off waiting until a quality pitcher shakes free. Right now, Sosa is hovering over them and Torre is uncomfortable with it.</p>
        <p>''We try to put the distractions aside,'' Torre said. ''Sometimes you can't. You can't let things you have no control over affect you.''</p>
        <p>After Tino Martinez bashed an upper deck homer off Tim Wakefield to push the Yankees ahead, 2-1, Torre exhaled. Pedro Martinez did what he usually does against the Yankees with six crisp innings. Ramiro Mendoza did what he usually does against the Red Sox with awesome relief. And the Yankees won a low-scoring, one-run game, which is what they usually do in October.</p>
        <p>''It was a good game for us,'' Torre said. ''You never want someone you're competing with to come into your house and take two games.''</p>
        <p>Torre was swiveling in his office chair 20 minutes after the Yankees won for the second time in the last 10 regular-season games against Boston, happy that his team had muddled through a draining game. He has a left fielder in Ricky Ledee who is playing scared and a future Hall of Famer in Clemens who had been terrible for the last two starts and who could be out until July.</p>
        <p>It is easy to see the uneasiness around Ledee, who made an error for the second straight game yesterday and made a leaping try for Nomar Garciaparra's fly ball that deflected off his glove for a controversial homer. Ledee valiantly talked about ignoring the uncertainty, but he admitted last month that his sleep is often interrupted by dreams about doing better. What do you think the 26-year-old dreams about when Sosa's name is broached?</p>
        <p>''Everybody's talking about it,'' Ledee said. ''It's not hard to hear stuff or that you're going somewhere.''</p>
        <p>Torre, a hundred times more secure than Ledee, said: ''While you're in this uniform, you have to think it's forever. Today is forever.''</p>
        <p>It was a cute comment, but even Torre has been more ruffled than usual by the Sosa speculation. Torre woke up yesterday to learn that Steinbrenner had uttered the immortal words, ''We better do something, don't you think?'' and the manager cringed. Torre appreciates Steinbrenner's passion, but explained that it will ''make it tougher to do something because everyone else will read that.''</p>
        <p>Even as Torre was saying before the game that the Yankees have experience with ignoring distractions, he was plotting to keep reporters from questioning players. Thirty minutes. Torre wanted the Yankees to have 30 minutes away from hypothetical questions. But the most critical hypothetical question is whether these Yankees can prove really soon that Sosa is unnecessary for them to win.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to believe we have the ability here,'' Torre said. ''Is this team going to be more consistent? I'd like to believe that. We don't know until it happens.''</p>
