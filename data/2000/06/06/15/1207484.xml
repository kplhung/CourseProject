        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>ETHIOPIA: YES TO PEACE -- Ethiopia accepted a peace plan to end a two-year border war with Eritrea, paving the way for a cease-fire and the deployment of a United Nations force to keep the rival armies apart. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said a proposal drawn up by the Organization of African Unity had been approved by his cabinet. The plan calls for setting up a 15-mile buffer zone in Eritrea along the disputed border, to be policed by a peacekeeping force. Eritrea has already accepted the plan.</p>

        <p>NIGERIA: NEW SHARIAH STATE -- Shariah will go into effect next week in Kano, the third of Nigeria's 36 states to adopt the Islamic penal and social code. Hundreds were killed this year in clashes between Muslims and Christians in the state of Kaduna, which was considering introducing Shariah. The movement toward Shariah is considered by many to be politically inspired, intended to weaken the government of President Olusegun Obasanjo, a Christian.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: PLEA ON LESBIAN RULING -- The government has asked the High Court of Justice to expand its panel of judges and review its recent landmark ruling that allowed a lesbian who adopted her partner's son in California to be officially listed as his second mother. The couple, Nicole and Ruti Berner-Kadish, urged the court to reject the request, and said they had been subjected to homophobic harassment since the ruling was made public.</p>
        <p>Deborah Sontag (NYT)</p>
        <p>ISRAEL: RED CROSS COMPROMISE -- Israel and its relief agency, the Magen David Adom, proposed a compromise in Geneva in the controversy over whether it can become a Red Cross movement member while still using the red Shield of David emblem instead of the Red Cross or Red Crescent to identify its workers. Israel said it wanted to continue to use the shield for its work inside the country, but put it inside a new, neutral emblem outside its borders.</p>

        <p>ARGENTINA: THOUSANDS STRIKE -- Thousands of government workers went on a one-day strike to protest austerity policies that are cutting their salaries by between 12 and 15 percent. The action came less than a week after a general strike paralyzed the country for a day in protest at the 14 percent jobless rate.</p>
        <p>Clifford Krauss (NYT)</p>
        <p>MEXICO: JOURNALIST QUIZZED -- One of Mexico's best-known journalists, Sergio Sarmiento, was called in as a witness in a high-profile murder case by the Mexico City district attorney, raising a storm of protest from the press. Mr. Sarmiento said he cited his professional confidentiality rights and refused to reveal how he obtained an interview last year with former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. He said prosecutors seemed to be looking for a connection between a visit by Mr. Salinas and the killing of the comedian Francisco  Stanley.</p>

        <p>PACIFIC</p>
        <p>SOLOMON ISLANDS: PREMIER QUITS -- Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu resigned, saying he did so under duress but that the resignation would pave the way for peace between warring factions. Tensions have been growing for 18 months since indigenous Guadalcanal residents, called Isatabus, began forcing out migrants from the nearby island of Malaita.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: TROOP PULLOUT -- With paramilitary cease-fires holding and security improving, Britain's military presence fell to 13,500, its lowest level in three decades as the last 100 paratroopers scheduled for withdrawal flew to the mainland. Troop levels reached 30,000 in 1972.</p>
        <p>Warren Hoge (NYT)</p>
        <p>FRANCE: ALGERIAN'S PLEA -- On the first day of a four-day visit, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria urged closer ties between the two nations. In a speech to the National Assembly he condemned the colonial past but called his state visit, the first by an Algerian leader since 1982, a reunion of friends.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: McDONALD'S SECOND THOUGHTS -- After more than 800 shopkeepers in the Marais, the Paris district known for its synagogues and Jewish shops, signed a petition to keep a McDonald's restaurant out of the neighborhood, the company announced it was abandoning plans to open a restaurant there. The shopkeepers said a fast-food outlet would ruin their neighborhood. McDonald's said it dropped the project because of technical difficulties.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: JEWISH SPLIT -- The Jewish minority appeared split after a new group declared a leader of the Hasidic Chabad Lubavitch movement, Rabbi Berl Lazar, the nation's chief rabbi. That title has been claimed since the early 1980's by Adolf Shayevich, an Orthodox rabbi. Each sect called the other's leader an imposter. Some linked the dispute to the arrest of the media baron Vladimir A. Gusinsky, who heads the group that supports Rabbi Shayevich. Rabbi Lazar, above, appears to have the Kremlin's support.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: SUICIDE BLAST -- A suicide bomber in Colombo tried to blow up a bus carrying wounded airmen, but the attack was impeded by a passing cyclist, the police said. Two civilians died in the blast, for which the police blamed Tamil Tiger rebels.</p>
        <p>Barry Bearak (NYT)</p>
        <p>INDIA: PAKISTAN REJECTED -- A spokesman termed a recent overture by Pakistan for nuclear restraint as ''essentially propagandist,'' and said India would discuss arms control only after Pakistan ''stops cross-border terrorism.'' Pakistan's foreign minister, Abdul Sattar, is in Washington this week for talks on security issues.</p>
