        <p>Op-Ed article by Repr Nydia M Velazquez defends legislation recently passed by House to eliminate estate tax against charge that it mainly benefits the rich; says measure will help preserve small businesses through the generations; says parents work hard to leave their family businesses to their children, and heirs should not be forced to sell those businesses to pay estate tax (M)</p>

        <p>As the senior Democrat on the House Small Business Committee, I meet regularly with small-business owners who speak enthusiastically about their struggles and rewards. Many glow with pride as they place a hand on the shoulder of a son or daughter who  they hope will one day inherit the family business.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the reality for family-owned small businesses is that one-third will be forced to sell or partially liquidate themselves to pay estate taxes on the owner's death. (Many small businesses' earnings are taxed as personal income.) To try to avoid that fate, small businesses spend millions of dollars each year on estate planning. The estate tax rate is even higher for those owners who elect to pass their businesses on to a grandchild because of a penalty for generation skipping.</p>

        <p>As the senior Democrat on the House Small Business Committee, I meet regularly with small-business owners who speak enthusiastically about their struggles and rewards. Many glow with pride as they place a hand on the shoulder of a son or daughter who  they hope will one day inherit the family business.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the reality for family-owned small businesses is that one-third will be forced to sell or partially liquidate themselves to pay estate taxes on the owner's death. (Many small businesses' earnings are taxed as personal income.) To try to avoid that fate, small businesses spend millions of dollars each year on estate planning. The estate tax rate is even higher for those owners who elect to pass their businesses on to a grandchild because of a penalty for generation skipping.</p>
        <p>Recently, the House of Representatives passed legislation to eliminate the estate tax, a plan that will be used as the basis for solving this problem. The measure does not just benefit the rich, as some have argued. More than half of those who paid death taxes in 1996 had estates valued at less than $1 million, with most valued below $5 million. These are not the Rockefellers and Carnegies; they're the families next door. The legislation establishes a threshold to ensure that small businesses will benefit. For these businesses the issue is one of simple fairness. Small business represents 99 percent of all American employers and provides jobs for more than half of all nonfarm workers. These entrepreneurs generate 80 percent of the jobs, nearly half of them in the high-tech sector. They produce the majority of new products, and obtain more patents and make more discoveries than large companies. They are responsible for most of the basic skills training for our work force.</p>
        <p>Small-business owners also have a new face, which is increasingly minority and female. At last count, there were two million minority-owned businesses and more than nine million businesses owned by women. And the numbers are growing.</p>
        <p>Yet many first-generation business people know that the odds are against giving their children a chance to carry on the family trade. Some 70 percent of family businesses don't survive into the second generation, and almost 90 percent don't make it to the third. The estate tax is one impediment to future success.</p>
        <p>As a child, I saw what members of my family had to do to keep a small business afloat. So I share the anxiety expressed in the letter of a New York man who is a third-generation owner of a manufacturing business. He estimated that in the last five years he had spent more than $300,000 in legal and consultant fees, life insurance and other planning expenses to protect his children from having to sell the business to pay estate taxes when he dies. Despite the careful planning, he worries he may have overlooked something. He is also concerned about his 150 employees, who would lose their jobs and benefits, should his children not be able to pay the estate taxes.</p>
        <p>His story is one of many. A survey of 365 businesses in New York State found that one-third anticipate having to sell or partially liquidate their businesses to meet their federal estate taxes. They could better spend their time and money on capital investment, job creation and employee benefits. Small businesses face enough hurdles without bearing the added burden of archaic laws that essentially tax them on their profits and then tax them again when the owner dies.</p>
        <p>Parents work hard to leave their family business to the children. Those children should not be forced to sell that business to pay taxes once they inherit it. Protecting family businesses and fueling our new economy is what reforming the estate tax is all about.</p>
