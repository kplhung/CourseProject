        <p>As dozens of airlines take advantage of a new federal law easing restrictions on the number of flights in and out of New York City's airports, city officials say La Guardia Airport could be overwhelmed by delays and congestion and have filed suit to try to curb increased air traffic there.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Queens borough president, Claire Shulman, filed suit on Tuesday against the Department of Transportation in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The suit contends that the government must conduct an environmental impact study before allowing the airlines to add what city officials say could be as many as 500 additional flights a day in and out of La Guardia by the end of the year.</p>

        <p>As dozens of airlines take advantage of a new federal law easing restrictions on the number of flights in and out of New York City's airports, city officials say La Guardia Airport could be overwhelmed by delays and congestion and have filed suit to try to curb increased air traffic there.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Queens borough president, Claire Shulman, filed suit on Tuesday against the Department of Transportation in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The suit contends that the government must conduct an environmental impact study before allowing the airlines to add what city officials say could be as many as 500 additional flights a day in and out of La Guardia by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The increased flights are authorized under a law signed by President Clinton on April 5 that was aimed at expanding service between New York, Washington and Chicago and smaller cities. The law allows the transportation agency to approve many more applications to operators of planes holding up to 71 passengers.</p>
        <p>In the last two months, several airlines have announced plans to add direct service between La Guardia  and cities on the East Coast and upstate, including Albany; Rochester; Richmond, Va.; Bangor, Me.; and Savannah, Ga. Additional flights are also planned for Kennedy International Airport, but La Guardia is already the more congested airport.</p>
        <p>City officials said La Guardia could safely handle 50 more flights a day. But if hundreds are added in the next year, the officials said, roads to the airport could be swarmed with vehicles. Queens traffic congestion and noise could be unbearable, they said.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we can afford to wait to find out how terrible it is,'' said Ms. Shulman, adding that La Guardia now handles 1,200 flights a day.</p>
        <p>Most service by larger planes is still restricted under what is known as the high density rule. A provision of a different federal law, the high density rule limits flights at the nation's four busiest airports: La Guardia and Kennedy in New York, O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington. The high density rule will be in effect at the New York airports until 2007.</p>
        <p>Proponents of allowing more flights in and out of the four airports say easing the restrictions will benefit travelers who have been subject to unreasonably high fares and the inconvenience of a limited number of flights to smaller cities.</p>
        <p>Transportation officials said yesterday they could not comment on the lawsuit. But they said that in exempting the smaller planes from the high density rule, the new federal law was intended to expand service quickly and therefore does not require environmental impact studies.</p>
        <p>The officials also said that all airlines that add regional service would  be required to use the quietest planes  available. The officials added that many airlines were planning to phase in their new service over several months or years.</p>
