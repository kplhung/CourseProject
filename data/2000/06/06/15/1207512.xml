        <p>Using Flag Day as his backdrop, Mayor Philip A. Giordano of Waterbury, a little-known Republican, set off today on a long-shot bid to unseat Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the veteran Democrat who is seeking election in November to a third term.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giordano, a 37-year-old lawyer, is the only Republican so far to challenge Mr. Lieberman, 58, an immensely popular incumbent who has more than $3.3 million in campaign funds at the ready and who defeated his opponent in 1994 by more than 350,000 votes. In fact, Republican leaders, including Gov. John G. Rowland, initially discouraged Mr. Giordano from running, believing that any effort to oust Mr. Lieberman, a leading voice among moderate Democrats, would be futile.</p>

        <p>Using Flag Day as his backdrop, Mayor Philip A. Giordano of Waterbury, a little-known Republican, set off today on a long-shot bid to unseat Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the veteran Democrat who is seeking election in November to a third term.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giordano, a 37-year-old lawyer, is the only Republican so far to challenge Mr. Lieberman, 58, an immensely popular incumbent who has more than $3.3 million in campaign funds at the ready and who defeated his opponent in 1994 by more than 350,000 votes. In fact, Republican leaders, including Gov. John G. Rowland, initially discouraged Mr. Giordano from running, believing that any effort to oust Mr. Lieberman, a leading voice among moderate Democrats, would be futile.</p>
        <p>''I know a lot of you will be teasing me about the advice I was giving the mayor not to run, but the important thing is that the mayor has decided he is going to run,'' Mr. Rowland said today at the State Capitol, where he endorsed Mr. Giordano.</p>
        <p>Of his own past support for Mr. Lieberman, the governor said: ''I admire him. He is a great friend of mine, and I am supporting Mr. Giordano.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman is such a strong favorite to keep his seat that the only question raised concerning his re-election so far this year has come not from any Republican challenger in Connecticut, but from persistent if unlikely rumors that he is being considered by Vice President Al Gore as a potential running mate.</p>
        <p>But state Republican leaders today predicted an upset. ''It's June,'' said Chris DePino, the chairman of the state Republican Party. ''Let's have another talk around the first of September.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DePino was initially less than enthusiastic about the possibility of Mr. Giordano's candidacy. But he said he changed his mind after watching Mr. Giordano travel the state seeking support. ''He went out and began to climb the mountain,'' Mr. DePino said. ''I am very impressed with that.''</p>
        <p>To begin his campaign today, Mr. Giordano traveled by bus to Stamford, New London and Hartford before returning home to Waterbury for a rally outside City Hall, where he is now in his third two-year term as mayor. At each stop, he attacked Mr. Lieberman as being more concerned with national issues than with the interests of his home state.</p>
        <p>''He has been busy raising his own national profile at the expense of the interest of the hard-working men, women and families of our state of Connecticut,'' Mr. Giordano said.</p>
        <p>Throughout his first day on the trail, he hewed to a patriotic theme. ''Red, white and blue -- courage, innocence and justice,'' he said. ''It is no coincidence that I stand before you today announcing my candidacy for U.S. Senate on June 14, a day on which we commemorate the colors and the ideals of the flag.''</p>
        <p>Dan Gerstein, a spokesman for Mr. Lieberman, said the senator welcomed Mr. Giordano to the race. ''He looks forward to hearing what the mayor plans to do for the people of Connecticut, what kind of vision he has for the state,'' Mr. Gerstein said.</p>
        <p>Waterbury, a city of 108,000 people, is about 35 miles north of Bridgeport and the same distance west of Hartford, and is best known as the hometown of Mr. Rowland and as the beneficiary of much gubernatorial largess, including a new state office complex.</p>
        <p>But municipal finances have suffered recently, and Mr. Giordano ordered the layoffs of more than 170 city workers, including some police officers, to avoid raising taxes.</p>
        <p>His handling of city finances, not to mention his previously troubled personal finances, is likely to become an issue in the campaign. Late last month, a state supervisory board rejected the $257 million budget that Mr. Giordano had prepared for the fiscal year beginning July 1.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giordano's personal finances have seen some similarly hard times. In January, he was sued for defaulting on a $6,500 student loan from his days at Thomas M. Cooley Law School in Lansing, Mich. The suit was dropped after he agreed in March to repay the loan. And in 1997, the mayor's Jeep Grand Cherokee was repossessed after he failed to make the monthly payments. The car was returned to him after he caught up on the payments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giordano, who is married and has three children, was born in Caracas, Venezuela, but has lived in Connecticut since the age of 4, with the exception of four years in the Marines and three years in Michigan for law school. He served as a state representative for a year before becoming mayor.</p>
