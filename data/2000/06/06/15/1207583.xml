        <p>The police released photographs of seven young men yesterday who were caught on amateur videotapes taken Sunday in Central Park during a wild melee in which at least two dozen women were sexually abused after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade.</p>
        <p>Police Commissioner Howard Safir called a news conference to ask for the public's help in finding the otherwise unidentified men, saying detectives wanted to arrest them.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Safir, responding to repeated television broadcasts of the tapes showing a gantlet of sex attacks in the sweltering park and to criticism that some officers failed to respond to complaints about roving bands assaulting women, said that the department would review how it handled the parade.</p>
        <p>Officials said a group of senior commanders would examine the logistics, planning, intelligence gathering, enforcement of minor offenses and traffic control, and the deployment of the more than 4,000 officers assigned to the detail.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Safir rejected criticism that the department had been passive in the face of escalating troubles during the day because it did not want to display force or resolve at a parade attended primarily by members of minority groups.</p>
        <p>''Let me clear that up once and for all,'' he said. ''There are no special parameters for the Puerto Rican Day Parade.''</p>
        <p>The review comes as scores of Internal Affairs Bureau detectives are conducting a separate investigation into whether particular police officers at the parade failed to take action when women complained that they had been attacked. A senior official said investigators were looking into reports of about half a dozen such incidents, but had yet to confirm that any had occurred.</p>
        <p>''I think that it's very important that we look at ourselves to see if we did the right thing, and if we can do better in the future,'' Mr. Safir said, ''and that's exactly what we're going to do.''</p>
        <p>Detectives from the Manhattan South Homicide Squad, part of a task force investigating the attacks, culled the seven pictures from 10 videotapes made by people in the park that recorded the assaults, were seeking to arrest the men late yesterday. They said the men were among as many as 50 in several unruly groups that swarmed around women as they went by, splashing water on them, tearing clothes off their backs and grabbing their breasts and buttocks.</p>
        <p>Two men were arrested just minutes after one such incident Sunday and charged with sexual abuse and robbery. Mr. Safir said yesterday that he did not know whether either of the men, Tremayne Bain, 23, and David Rowe, 24, appeared on any of the 10 tapes reviewed by the police. Both Mr. Bain and Mr. Rowe, whose lawyers and families have maintained their innocence, were released yesterday on $10,000 bail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir said the police were offering rewards of $2,000 for information leading to the indictment of any  suspects, and an additional $10,000 if the tip secured a conviction.</p>
        <p>The pictures, some grainy and blurred, showed young men milling about in crowds, and in some cases participating in the abuse. The men wore T-shirts and tank tops, gold chains and sports jerseys. Some are smiling. One picture shows a burly arm bearing a tattoo of a crucifix. The tattoo says, ''Work Hard, Play Hard.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, a senior investigator said the number of victims who had been assaulted had risen to 27, and the work of the detectives from Manhattan South had provided a broader picture of the attacks during the course of the afternoon. The first occurred in the park around 2 o'clock  near East 80th Street, and they continued on and off until around 6:45,  with a majority in the southeast section of the park near Central Park South and the Avenue of the Americas, the investigator said.</p>
        <p>The behavior in almost all the assaults was similar, the investigator said: The men splashed water on the women and grabbed or groped them. As part of the investigation, detectives were checking whether similar crimes were reported elsewhere in the city or on the subways later in the day, in an effort to track the movement of the suspects, the investigator said. They were also checking to see whether any summonses were issued in or around the park or on the subways that could have been related to the assaults.</p>
        <p>Last night, two 21-year-old New Jersey women who said they were among the victims of the assaults  announced that they planned to sue the city, claiming it failed to protect them.</p>
        <p>In a separate appeal to the public, Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, who is of Puerto Rican descent, called on the Latino community to cooperate with the police yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferrer said at a news conference near Central Park that Puerto Ricans were obligated to step forward and tell the police if they had any information about the attacks. ''This outrage won't go away,'' he said. ''This stain remains on the life of this city until these individuals are all found and apprehended.''</p>
        <p>Earlier yesterday, Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, said he had met with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani about the incidents in the park, and he distributed a letter he said he had sent to the mayor. In the letter, Mr. Vallone asked why officers had failed to react aggressively, and he called for a review.</p>
        <p>At a police news conference later, Mr. Safir acknowledged disappointment with the police response as the crowds grew and the situation became fluid Sunday.</p>
        <p>''Our supervisors need to go not just with the original parade plan,'' Mr. Safir said, while talking about his goals for the review. ''I would hope that when supervisors see large amounts of people moving into another area, they would redeploy more police officers there. That apparently was not done here. I think that's something we can learn from.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir's remarks came as more witnesses described a lackadaisical effort by the police late in the afternoon as the parade wound down. Peter N. Duhamel, 54, said he jogged through the southeast corner of the park about 3:45 and saw restless crowds and passive officers. Mr. Duhamel, a former assistant United States attorney, said he was a supporter of the police and had been impressed with the department's crowd control tactics in the past, but was surprised this time.</p>
        <p>''I was struck immediately by how casual the whole deployment was out there,'' he said. ''The whole attitude was mind-boggling.''</p>
        <p>He said it appeared that the crowd was ''testing and testing, and then it's out of control.''</p>
        <p>Nathan Poe, 27, a Web site designer who was riding his bicycle through the park, said he was stunned to see officers standing idly by along Fifth Avenue at East 72nd Street as paradegoers drank rum from bottles and offered shots in paper cups to passers-by.</p>
        <p>''There was alcohol all over the street, bottles of liquor, people offering shots to people who walked by,''  Mr. Poe said. ''It seemed to me that the foundation for what occurred was being set.''</p>
        <p>But a senior police official dismissed accounts of police nonchalance. ''I was around in the bad old days when we were told at the West Indian parade: 'You see nothing. Hold the perimeter,' '' the official said. ''That is clearly not the case here.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani acknowledged yesterday that New Yorkers were concerned about the events in the park, but he noted that crime there was still down sharply.</p>
        <p>''It's like an airplane crash,'' he said. ''When an airplane crash takes place, people have a fear of flying and people cancel flights.</p>
        <p>''As things return to normal and they realize that airplane flying is not more dangerous than riding in an automobile, or maybe less dangerous, they gain perspective. Their perspective is lost right now.''</p>
