      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it had reached a tentative settlement with several black employees who sued the company 14 months ago, contending that they were denied promotions, raises and other opportunities because of the color of their skin.</p>
        <p>Within minutes of the settlement announcement, lawyers representing four other black employees filed a new lawsuit against the company in a Georgia state court, asking for $1.5 billion in damages.</p>
        <p>The settlement, whose details were not disclosed, is intended to cover not just the plaintiffs, but 2,000 black employees who worked at the company over the last decade. The plaintiffs had sought payments as well as policy changes at the company and wanted those extended to all black employees. A class certification brief, detailing the employees' experiences at the company, was due to be filed yesterday; lawyers for both sides worked through much of Tuesday night and all day yesterday, apparently to beat that deadline.</p>
        <p>The federal judge overseeing the case ordered yesterday that the amount of payments be determined by the end of October with the help of outside experts. A final settlement, which must be approved by the judge, Richard W. Story, might not take effect until early next year.</p>
        <p>''I would categorize our mood as being very, very cautious,'' said Larry Jones, who organized a boycott of Coke products this spring. ''We are well acquainted with Coke's practices and their penchant for distortion, so until we know the details, we will continue our boycott.''</p>
        <p>A Coke executive said the company was ''very pleased that both sides have come to an agreement on the settlement principles.''</p>
        <p>The second lawsuit, which accuses Coke management of intentional emotional harm, negligent supervision and hiring, racial harassment and discrimination, threatens to undermine the settlement, because employees could choose to reject the settlement in favor of new litigation.</p>
        <p>Carl Ware, Coke's executive vice president for corporate affairs, called the new lawsuit ''an 11th-hour act of blatant and disruptive legal maneuvering by other lawyers seeking to prolong the process and forestall the real progress that we have made here.''</p>
        <p>The lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the new lawsuit are Johnnie L. Cochran, who defended O. J. Simpson in his murder trial in 1995, and Willie E. Gary, a Florida lawyer who specializes in personal-injury cases. The plaintiffs are four black women, whose complaints include being subjected to rude remarks and being paid less than white counterparts.</p>
        <p>The original lawsuit, filed in April 1999 by four current and former Coca-Cola employees, rocked a company that had long prided itself on its race relations and its global outlook. From their headquarters in Atlanta, a city that has described itself as ''too busy to hate,'' Coke executives declared early on that the lawsuit was without merit.</p>
        <p>But the accusations, and Coke's response to them, further damaged the image of a company also struggling with declining earnings, a plummeting stock price and the fallout from a European product recall.  The company's chairman and chief executive at the time of the suit, M. Douglas Ivester, was criticized for his decision to shuffle top management last fall in a way that alienated Mr. Ware, then a senior vice president who was Coke's highest-ranking black employee. Mr. Ware, 56, then retired in November.</p>
        <p>The outcry over Mr. Ware's departure was followed by the resignation of Mr. Ivester, who suddenly announced his own retirement, at age 52, in December. His successor, Douglas N. Daft, quickly rehired Mr. Ware, promoting him to executive vice president. Mr. Daft also chose a black woman to head the company's human resources division, promoted another black executive to lead the newly formed office of diversity, and declared that compensation would be tied to diversity goals for all senior managers at Coke. He also stated his intention to resolve the lawsuit as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>The stormy trail to yesterday's tentative settlement has occurred during unprecedented upheaval at Coke. In January, trying to stem its fiscal woes, Coke announced an extensive revamping that included layoffs of 5,200 employees, among them about 2,500 people in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>The black employees who lost their jobs were asked to sign waivers entitling them to better severance packages in exchange for forfeiting any participation in the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The litigation had already grown tense. The plaintiffs' lawyers contended last fall that Coke executives had destroyed important hiring and compensation records, and had even purchased a shredder to speed up the process. Coke insisted that no shredder had been purchased and no documents destroyed. A subsequent filing by the plaintiffs included an invoice from Staples showing that a shredder had been ordered for the office of one executive who worked on Coke's defense in the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>On Jan. 25, Judge Story, of the United States District Court in Atlanta, ordered both sides to begin settlement talks, although the litigation could continue. Coke subsequently revoked the waiver forcing laid-off employees to give up their right to participate in the suit.</p>
        <p>The first settlement talks were held in mid-April, shortly before Coke's annual shareholder meeting. Wall Street analysts and investors were already calling on Coke to settle the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The meeting, normally a quiet event, was dominated by discussions of Coke's need to improve its record on diversity and included an appearance by several dozen black employees, who rode a bus from Atlanta to the meeting in Wilmington, Del., to protest their treatment.</p>
        <p>The leader of the group, Larry Jones, who was laid off after 15 years with the company, called for a boycott of Coke products. He was followed to the podium by the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, who criticized Coke and its board for lacking diversity but did not endorse the boycott, which has been largely confined to pockets of Atlanta.</p>
        <p>There has also been significant tension among the plaintiffs, whose number grew to eight this year. Since April, four of them have hired Mr. Gary, who is known for his hefty settlements, including a multimillion-dollar settlement in a civil lawsuit brought by a Mississippi funeral home owner against the Loewen Group of Canada.</p>
        <p>The split among the plaintiffs occurred in April, when Gregory Allen Clark hired Mr. Gary instead. Mr. Clark had grown disenchanted with Cyrus Mehri, the lawyer who initiated the lawsuit against Coke, and was introduced by Mr. Jackson, an old friend of Mr. Gary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gary is also the chairman and chief executive of MBC Network, a cable channel that he founded with several celebrities to provide religious and entertainment programs for black families. The channel signed a five-year advertising contract with Coke in March. Mr. Gary says there was no conflict of interest for him in representing the plaintiffs in their claims against Coke. Legal experts say he would be disqualified as a lawyer in a class-action case, but he could represent individuals as long they signed documents saying they were informed of the details of his relationship with Coke.</p>
        <p>''This case is not just about you and me,'' Elyvenia Barton-Gibson, one of the plaintiffs who reached a settlement yesterday, said in a statement. ''This victory is about change that must happen so our children don't have to face the same obstacles years from now we face today. My hope is that in the coming months when this settlement becomes final there will be a new day at the Coca-Cola Company.''</p>
