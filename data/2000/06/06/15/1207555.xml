        <p>Citing expectations of higher revenue and reduced spending, the Eastman Kodak Company said yesterday that it would accelerate its stock repurchase program, buying as much as $1.2 billion in stock by the end of the year. Robert Brust, chief financial officer, said the Rochester-based company would buy back $9 million to $10 million worth of shares a day, starting today. That is up sharply from the current daily average of about $1 million. Last year, Kodak bought back about $925 million of its stock under a repurchasing program announced in April 1999. Shares of Kodak rose $1.50 yesterday, to $60.25 each, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
