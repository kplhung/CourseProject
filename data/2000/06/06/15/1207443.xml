        <p>The bassist Milt Hinton, known as Judge, belongs to all of jazz, if not all of popular music. He made his recording debut in 1930 with a group led by the Chicago pianist Tiny Parham.</p>
        <p>He played in Cab Calloway's band for 15 years, from the 1930's to the 50's. At various points he drove the rhythm sections of bands led by Count Basie, Louis Armstrong, Pearl Bailey and George Russell. Unlike many of his pre-bop contemporaries, he hungrily absorbed the new harmonies of younger bop musicians like Dizzy Gillespie. The years he spent as a studio musician have caused some historians to proclaim him the most recorded bassist in history. And he has spent the last 30 years helping fellow bass players by teaching and setting up a scholarship fund.</p>

        <p>The bassist Milt Hinton, known as Judge, belongs to all of jazz, if not all of popular music. He made his recording debut in 1930 with a group led by the Chicago pianist Tiny Parham.</p>
        <p>He played in Cab Calloway's band for 15 years, from the 1930's to the 50's. At various points he drove the rhythm sections of bands led by Count Basie, Louis Armstrong, Pearl Bailey and George Russell. Unlike many of his pre-bop contemporaries, he hungrily absorbed the new harmonies of younger bop musicians like Dizzy Gillespie. The years he spent as a studio musician have caused some historians to proclaim him the most recorded bassist in history. And he has spent the last 30 years helping fellow bass players by teaching and setting up a scholarship fund.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hinton does not perform anymore, and he stayed in the audience next to his wife, Mona, for his 90th-birthday tribute concert at the Kaye Playhouse on Tuesday night as part of the JVC Jazz Festival. The show revolved around him with tunes from the Basie and Calloway repertory as well as his own favorite popular songs, like Victor Herbert's ''Indian Summer.'' Jay Leonhart performed a light humor song about meeting Mr. Hinton 40 years ago and benefiting from his wisdom and his work connections. And a forest of bassists, mostly recipients of his education fund, made an extraordinary spectacle.</p>
        <p>It's hard to recall a more intense and better jazz-concert production. More than 40 musicians were involved, organized into solos, duets, trios, quartets and so on; each constellation played one piece and hustled off. The evening was organizational perfection.</p>
        <p>It won't do to enumerate dozens of exemplary performances, but the result of such bounty on the stage was that the players began to organize themselves naturally into different kinds of excellence. There was the fluid (Russell Malone on barely amplified but easily heard guitar, Christian McBride on bass, Benny Green playing Art Tatum-like piano), the funky (Art Baron on trombone, Byron Stripling singing ''Minnie the Moocher''), the subtle and deep (Jimmy Heath's harmonically modern tenor saxophone solo on ''Jumpin' at the Woodside,'' Frank Wess in several turns on saxophone and flute), the open and good natured (Joe Bushkin on piano, Warren Vache on cornet) and the near-classical (Ron Carter on bass, Jay Leonhart on bass and singing).</p>
        <p>The bassist John Clayton was the evening's host, telling stories about Mr. Hinton and his wife. At the end Mr. Clayton invited 19 bassists on stage to perform a few songs: Mr. Clayton's tribute song, ''Our Father, Our Judge,'' and ''Old Man Time'' -- Mr. Hinton's latter-day theme song -- with the bassists dividing up to create several massive lines and counterlines.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hinton stood up and asked the crowd not to leave without stopping by and saying hello. The concert's proceeds benefited Mr. Hinton's scholarship fund. Concertgoers were given bags of M&amp;M's as they left -- presents from Milt and Mona. It was a charmed night.</p>
