        <p>AMONG ''Star Wars'' fanatics, George Lucas's student film ''Electronic Labyrinth: THX-1138 4EB'' is something of a legend. The 15-minute film, about an escapee from a futuristic, authoritarian society, won first prize at the 1967-68 National Student Film Festival and made Mr. Lucas a star at the University of Southern California's film school.</p>
        <p>On one level, the film can be seen as the director's declaration of independence from, if not outright hostility toward, the Hollywood system.</p>
        <p>So it is fitting that the original short, which has never been exhibited before a mass audience, had its ''premiere'' in May on the small screen at AtomFilms (www .atomfilms.com), an exhibitor, producer and distributor of digital movies.</p>
        <p>AtomFilms, Ifilm (www.ifilm.com), Pop.com (www.pop.com) and many other digital entertainment start-ups are betting that short films, once relegated to the fringe by the rigid formats of cinema (two-hour movies) and television (30-minute sitcoms and game shows), may be tailor-made for a growing number of small screens.</p>
        <p>Mika Salmi, the founder and chief executive of AtomFilms, says the audience is to be found not just in front of desktop and notebook computers but also on airplanes, in shopping malls and even in elevators.</p>
        <p>''Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138-4EB'' is part of the site's ongoing series of student films called USC Cinema Yearbook, which includes dozens of shorts from alumni like the director Robert Zemeckis (''The Lift'') and the animator Hal Barwood (''The Great Lost City of Xan'').</p>
        <p>The Lucas short film, which became the basis for his feature-length film ''THX-1138,'' has been downloaded more than 86,000 times since its debut on AtomFilms, becoming the 10th-most-popular film on the site. (''Bikini Bandits Episode 7,'' a comedy about bikini-clad bandits, takes first place with more than 400,000 views.) Those early rough efforts mesh well with the underground flavor of AtomFilms' other short films.</p>
        <p>To be sure, short films on the Web do not yet have Hollywood's full attention. The industry's flirtation with the Web has not gone beyond promotional trailers, but some movie veterans are entering the arena. James Brooks, David Lynch and Tim Burton have all signed on with Shockwave.com to develop animated shorts, and Barry Sonnenfeld will direct projects for Novix Media.  In March, ''Time Code,'' a big-screen film shot on digital film by Mike Figgis, had its  premiere at the Yahoo Internet Life Online Film Festival.</p>
        <p>The first film made specifically for the Internet to feature big-screen stars and special effects was ''The Quantum Project.'' It was produced for about $3 million by Metafilmics, the company that produced the 1998 movie ''What Dreams May Come.'' ''The Quantum Project,'' a 40-minute mini-feature starring John Cleese and Stephen Dorff, combines live action and computer-generated imagery (C.G.I.) with a science fiction-flavored mystery. The film made its online debut at midnight on May 5 at Sightsound, another big player in digital entertainment distribution; downloading it costs $3.95. Sightsound declined to release sales figures, although a spokesperson for the company said viewers in 54 countries had downloaded the film.</p>
        <p>''I thought for a while that the new media space -- primarily the Internet -- was a celebration of form and tech and had very little soul to it,'' said Barnet Bain, a producer and a founder of Metafilmics. He said films like ''The Quantum Project'' represented ''the kinds of stories that can be told left and right of what is deemed conventional and practical wisdom.''</p>
        <p>Whether the software required to watch online movies will allow for similar freedom remains to be seen. ''The Quantum Project'' was made available exclusively via Microsoft's Media Player.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bain maintains that because of broadband technology, the quality of streaming media over the Internet is improving. He also believes that such software is accessible to more people than are state-of-the-art theaters, which are concentrated in major metropolitan areas.</p>
        <p>''The bar is being raised very high very quickly in ways that will never, ever happen in theatrical distribution,'' he added. ''You'll always go to places where they're running a print that is generations old or has been used too many times.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bain said that marketing would become even more essential for movies in the digital world and that it was partly a chance to draw attention to the medium that had attracted him to the short film.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to be the first to the moon,'' he said.</p>
        <p>AtomFilms, on the other hand, may be first to the elevator. A deal is in the works to put the company's shorts on elevator screens being manufactured by Otis, the world's largest maker and installer of elevators.</p>
        <p>AtomFilms is also heading for the local mall, but the films will not be found in the movie theaters.</p>
        <p>Shopping malls using gigantic television monitors to advertise their stores will incorporate short-form programming, including animated shorts, to catch shoppers' attention and hold it for the advertising.</p>
        <p>More than a dozen airlines are also set to offer shorts from AtomFilms. Singapore Airlines will offer 50 short films as part of a new in-flight entertainment system that will also include 25 feature films and 50 audio CD's.</p>
        <p>AtomFilms owns the rights to nearly all of its approximately 1,000 digital-based short titles, with 300 to 400 more submitted every week.</p>
        <p>''With digital technology, more and more people are becoming filmmakers,'' Mr. Salmi said. ''It's so cheap to have a digital camera and some editing tools on your desktop.''</p>
        <p>AtomFilms' competition is growing, as well. Universal Pictures recently announced that it would invest in Reelshort.com, and sites like CinemaNow and Eveo are also creating virtual arenas where digital filmmakers have an opportunity to market and distribute their own work.</p>
        <p>''I think the future will be a flowering of different kinds of art and different kinds of storytelling,'' said Mr. Bain, who intends to show ''The Quantum Project'' in at least one theater to make it eligible for the Academy Awards.</p>
        <p>''No one need fear that the Internet is going to cannibalize or wipe out anything that is already here,'' Mr. Bain said. ''It's an add-on, another menu on a growing table.''</p>
