      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says arrest in Russia of Vladimir Gusinsky, owner of media properties that have criticized government, endangers Russia's fragile freedoms; questions whether Pres Vladimir Putin knew in advance of arrest, in which case he has done a disservice to press freedom he says he supports, or whether it occurred without his knowledge, in which case it is disturbing evidence of palace intrigue and political instability</p>

        <p>While President Vladimir Putin is traveling through Europe this week extolling the virtues of Russian democracy, his colleagues in the Kremlin have been acting like Stalinists. The arrest and detention of Vladimir Gusinsky, the owner of media properties that have carried critical coverage of the government, is an assault against the principle of a free press. Whatever the merits of the alleged embezzlement case against Mr. Gusinsky, there was no need to haul him off to prison, an action that cannot help but stir fear in a nation all too familiar with the arbitrary exercise of state power.</p>
        <p>If the rule of law prevailed in Russia, and Mr. Gusinsky could count on a presumption of innocence, quick release on bail and a fair trial, his arrest might seem less ominous. But Russia lacks a fully independent judicial system, and the government still uses criminal prosecution as a political weapon. He is charged with embezzling at least $10 million in federal property, apparently involving his purchase of a state-owned television station in St. Petersburg. He says the accusations are false.</p>

        <p>While President Vladimir Putin is traveling through Europe this week extolling the virtues of Russian democracy, his colleagues in the Kremlin have been acting like Stalinists. The arrest and detention of Vladimir Gusinsky, the owner of media properties that have carried critical coverage of the government, is an assault against the principle of a free press. Whatever the merits of the alleged embezzlement case against Mr. Gusinsky, there was no need to haul him off to prison, an action that cannot help but stir fear in a nation all too familiar with the arbitrary exercise of state power.</p>
        <p>If the rule of law prevailed in Russia, and Mr. Gusinsky could count on a presumption of innocence, quick release on bail and a fair trial, his arrest might seem less ominous. But Russia lacks a fully independent judicial system, and the government still uses criminal prosecution as a political weapon. He is charged with embezzling at least $10 million in federal property, apparently involving his purchase of a state-owned television station in St. Petersburg. He says the accusations are false.</p>
        <p>There is a stench of political retaliation about this case. Mr. Gusinsky's company, Media-Most, owns numerous newspapers and magazines as well as Russia's only independent television network. Their coverage of the war in Chechnya has been aggressive and skeptical, and they have not been hesitant to investigate government corruption and other misconduct. Last month heavily armed federal agents raided the Media-Most office in Moscow, the first signal that the Kremlin might be trying to intimidate Mr. Gusinsky.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin seemed surprised by the arrest, calling it ''a dubious present'' when he arrived in Madrid on Tuesday. That offers little comfort to anyone concerned about Russia's fragile freedoms. If the arrest was meant to embarrass Mr. Putin while he is visiting Western Europe, it is disturbing evidence of palace intrigue and political instability in the Kremlin. If Mr. Putin received advance notification about the arrest and failed to order the use of less draconian tactics, he has done a disservice to the press freedoms he says he supports.</p>
