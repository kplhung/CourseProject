        <p>A June 13 letter asks, ''When did it  become a disgrace in the United States to work hard, be successful, save regularly and invest wisely?'' and ''When did it become unacceptable to want to pass on to your children and grandchildren something  more tangible than good advice?''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A June 13 letter asks, ''When did it  become a disgrace in the United States to work hard, be successful, save regularly and invest wisely?'' and ''When did it become unacceptable to want to pass on to your children and grandchildren something  more tangible than good advice?''</p>
        <p>The answer is: never. Plenty of wealth is handed down for no other reason than ''accident of birth.'' Does the writer believe that America should revert to aristocracy?</p>
        <p>Haven't we been there and done that? The important question is why Congress, which supposedly represents 270 million Americans, is doing backflips to ensure the financial well-being of the wealthiest 0.1 percent of the population.</p>
