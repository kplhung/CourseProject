        <p>WHAT were they thinking?</p>
        <p>Three days after a pack of young men went on a rampage in Central Park and attacked at least 27 people, that's a lingering question about the mayor and his ever-faithful police commissioner. What were they thinking when they responded dismissively to initial reports of the incident?</p>
        <p>Women were stripped, groped, humiliated, some robbed by a roving mob early Sunday night after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade. And the city's leaders recite statistics to prove how safe the city is and defend police officers, some of whom were praised, others of whom were later accused by victims of passively ignoring pleas for help.</p>
        <p>''There was actually less violence this weekend than this weekend last year,'' the mayor advised the morning after the melee. He said, as he so often does, that last year was the safest in 35 or 36 years, that this year might be safer, and he revealed that ''policemen aren't everywhere.''</p>
        <p>Those illuminating remarks raise a second question, namely, what would we have known if amateur videotapes hadn't emerged? The truth tends to get out and would have in this case, even without videotapes and the articulate victims who have come forward. But the event might have been subject to even mightier spin attempts than it has been already: there was Monday's statistical lecture. And the case of the happy honeymooners.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, a mayoral aide tried to arrange news interviews with French honeymooners who, though attacked in the park, had praised the police. City Hall attached conditions, however: reporters could not say who set up the interview and could not ask certain questions. Most news organizations said no thanks.</p>
        <p>By Tuesday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir were showing more concern. The mayor has even allowed that if police officers had ignored requests for help, ''they will be significantly punished.'' He has also offered a reward and talked to some victims.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir, who on Monday called the attacks ''an isolated incident,'' sounded dismayed at reporters yesterday for asking about police conduct, calling the violence ''a horrendous situation that took place by a bunch of thugs, which has escaped a lot of you guys'' -- a reference to the very same horrendous situation reporters had been writing about for days.</p>
        <p>It's still unclear why even initial reports didn't rate some official outrage. By Monday morning, two men had been arrested and six women had already complained about being attacked. One of the amateur videotapes, which revealed the crude nature of the violence, didn't run on television until about 5:30 p.m. on Monday, but when the mayor and his police commissioner talked to reporters Monday morning, they did know about the six complaints. Not enough of a ''horrendous situation''?</p>
        <p>It is also unclear whether police officers on the scene had told superiors about trouble brewing outside the park. It certainly seemed to some that police officers were keeping hands off, perhaps a policy meant to avoid provoking an incident at an ethnic event. Mr. Safir and the mayor denied that. But consider this account, one of several:</p>
        <p>Jan Hodenfield, a writer, said he was on Park Avenue near 64th Street on Sunday with his 12-year-old son and a friend when the crowd from the parade threatened them. ''It was a marauding mob,'' Mr. Hodenfield recalled yesterday. ''And the cops were just standing there with their arms folded across their stomachs, looking elsewhere. Everything that happened after that made complete sense to me. One had the sense this was a mob, very distant from the city around them.''</p>
        <p>BY Tuesday, Mr. Giuliani caught up. He even went on the ''Today'' show.  The delayed reaction did its damage, though. It hurt many New Yorkers, especially women who remember when it was O.K. for the authorities to play down sex crimes against women, even rape.</p>
        <p>C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, departed from prepared remarks at a reception of the New York Women's Agenda, a coalition of women's organizations, to deplore the attacks. ''We want some action taken!'' she said.</p>
        <p>Marcia Loyd, a member of the group, agreed. ''When things like that happen, it makes me feel things haven't changed that much for women,'' said Ms. Loyd, who coordinates volunteers at a library and who also has a cake-catering business. ''When we are shrugged off like that, it's like we  were treated 50, 60 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Fact is, it matters how public leaders respond to troubling events. They set a tone. Even -- especially -- when tone-deaf.</p>
