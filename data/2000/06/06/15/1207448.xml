        <p>Predictions of rain and chilly temperatures kept attendance down on Tuesday night for the Metropolitan Opera's concert performance of Verdi's ''Rigoletto'' on the Great Lawn in Central Park, the first offering in this 34th summer season of the Met in the Parks. No doubt, some potential attendees may have been kept away as well by reports about a roving mob of men who attacked a number of women in the park on Sunday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The Parks Department estimated that roughly 6,000 hardy opera fans showed up for the performance. And though the air was damp, windy and chilly, the expected rain never came, except for a few misty droplets that broke out, as if on cue, during the last scene, just as Verdi's stormy music conjured up howling rains and winds outside the inn where Rigoletto's guilt-ridden daughter, Gilda, lovesick over the rakish Duke of Mantua, knowingly walks into the clutches of a hired assassin.</p>
        <p>Speaking to the audience before the performance, Joseph Volpe, the general manager of the Met, poked fun at all the ''fair-weather friends'' who had stayed home, and offered a ''special reward'' to those in attendance. Everyone who gave his or her name and address to one of the ushers would receive access to unsold seats at Met performances next season, he said. What he meant was not specified: probably discounted tickets; the word ''free'' was never invoked.</p>
        <p>Of course, it is unfair to assess the quality of voices and performances as heard through an outdoor amplified sound system, even the sophisticated equipment that is part of the portable Carlos Moseley Music Pavilion. But the Met in the Parks performances are never occasions for tallying off-pitch high notes and such. As usual, a real operatic experience managed to happen on this night, perhaps because so many people there were so palpably appreciative of the chance to picnic on the lawn and hear the Met perform a great Verdi opera free of charge.</p>
        <p>As Rigoletto, Carlo Guelfi, an Italian baritone, appearing with the Met for the first time, brought what seemed to be a robust, slightly nasal-toned voice and affecting dramatic dignity to his portrayal of the hunchbacked court jester. The tenor Roberto Aronica made an emotive and Italianate Duke. The bass Dimitri Kavrakos was an aptly chilling Sparafucile, the assassin hired by Rigoletto to kill the duke for ruining his daughter. The mezzo-soprano Wendy White made a buxom, sassy Maddalena, the assassin's sister, who also falls for the dastardly but charming duke. The standout performance came from the fine soprano Youngok Shin, who brought lovely sweet tone, flawless coloratura and lyrical sensitivity to the role of Gilda.</p>
        <p>For those in the audience who seldom get to the opera, the portly Nello Santi must have seemed the embodiment of what an Italian opera conductor is supposed to look like. These days the work of this veteran Met conductor is increasingly ineffective. He gesticulated wildly, shaking his hands and cutting off phrases with karate chops, as Ms. Shin and Mr. Aronica sang the gentle unaccompanied cadenza at the end of their love scene. Still, the Met musicians, long accustomed to Mr. Santi's kinetic conducting style, played ably.</p>
        <p>''Rigoletto'' will be presented tomorrow night with a different cast in Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. The casts will alternate for four more performances in Brooklyn and New Jersey through July 1. Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' which comes to Central Park on Tuesday, is also making the rounds, ending with a performance on June 30 in the downtown park in New Haven.</p>
        <p>''Rigoletto'' would seem an appropriate opera to entice New Yorkers into taking advantage of the parks. After all, its message is not that Gilda pays a price for disobeying the orders or her restrictive father, but that Rigoletto learns too late what a mistake it was to keep his daughter under lock and key at home, ignorant of her origins and the outside world.</p>
