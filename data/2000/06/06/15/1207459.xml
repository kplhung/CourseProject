        <p>It's enough to make a straphanger ponder his mortality, the state of the world, the fate of the universe itself.  All in the time it takes to catch the local.</p>
        <p>First, you descend into the newly renovated 81st Street subway stop on the B and C lines, and quickly come to the realization that Homo sapiens new yorkus, circa 2000 -- despite its vaunted sense of self-importance -- occupies only the tiniest of places in the earth's biological lineup.</p>
        <p>''Right here, this spot, this is about 500 million years B.C.,'' said Kendal Henry, an artist who works for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and who, yesterday morning, was pointing at a giant granite amoeba imbedded in the station floor outside one of the token booths.</p>
        <p>''We didn't come along for quite a while,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Further down the platform comes the stark band of black tile that represents the Cretaceous extinction, the one that finished off the dinosaurs. And finally, toward the northern end of the station, not yet completed, will be another band of tile fading from white to black, a sobering suggestion that if humans are not careful they, too, could be finished off.</p>
        <p>It is not the usual sort of distraction offered to riders in the city's subway stations. But then again, there are no other stations that form a threshold to the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
        <p>And so when the M.T.A.'s Arts for Transit program began to think about how to shape the renovation of the station two years ago, they spent as much time with curators, archaeologists, paleontologists and herpetologists as they did with architects and engineers.</p>
        <p>The result, which cost $11.3 million and which the M.T.A. will officially unveil in a ceremony today, is a sort of snapshot pageant of all life as we know it, from the image of the Big Bang that swirls in front of the token booth near the 81st Street entrance to the bronze cast of Tyrannosaurus rex that towers over the downtown platform to the tiny Jesus lizard crawling up the wall.</p>
        <p>E. Virgil Conway, the M.T.A. chairman, said the goal was a melding of the museum and the station so that the station ''begins a visitor's experience the minute they step off the train.''</p>
        <p>But Sandra Bloodworth, the director of Arts for Transit, added that the agency ''also didn't want people to lose the distinct sense that they were in a subway station.''</p>
        <p>So the artists who managed the renovation, Mr. Henry, 29, and Mona Chen, 33, wildly mingled elements of subway station design from the 1930's with images of creatures that seemed to have crawled, swam, slithered, flown and loped out of the halls of the museum next door. An African tree boa dangles from one of the familiar blue tile bands that run along the subway platform wall. A woodpecker seems to be chopping away at the blue mosaic name panel that identifies the station.</p>
        <p>''Before this, most of what I knew about natural history came from third grade science class,'' said Ms. Chen, who added that she, Mr. Henry and Ms. Bloodworth ''spent six months practically living in the museum'' as the project was being planned.</p>
        <p>''Now,'' she said, ''you find yourself watching Discover a lot. And thinking a lot more about what's going on around you.''</p>
        <p>For the most part, she said, she and Mr. Henry had a free hand to create their own images of creatures fearsome and fantastic, borrowing from and checking against the museum's collection. They filled the station with frogs, stingrays and crocodiles, and even a coelacanth (pronounced SEE-luh-kanth), the prehistoric fish that was thought extinct until one was pulled from the ocean off the coast of South Africa more than 60 years ago.</p>
        <p>Ms. Chen added that the artists had quite a bit of technical help from the scientists. ''They checked what we were doing to make sure there weren't six legs on something when there should have been four,'' she said. (Workers will soon go to work to fix a nautilus squid. Turns out it was upside down, though it would have taken a sharp straphanger to spot it.)</p>
        <p>The artists were also able to take a little license on the size of things. There are ticks, for example, as big as toasters, and the humpback whale has been downsized to subway platform proportions. The bronze fossil cast of T. rex is, however, full size. ''We had to have T. rex,'' Mr. Henry said. ''How could we not have T. rex?''</p>
        <p>The decorative elements of the station, which the museum helped pay for with a $1 million donation, are about 80 percent completed. Yesterday, Stephen Miotto, the mosaicist responsible for turning the artists' conceptions into hundreds of thousands of glass mosaic tiles during the last year, was hosing down a mastodon.</p>
        <p>A ceramic moon will soon rise over a doorway. The shark that seems to be swimming downstairs will soon be swimming in blue tiles of ocean. And a few more ceramic fish, the creations of an artist named Margie Hughto, will be joining commuters on the way to the train.</p>
        <p>''She told us she was going to throw in a few extra fish for free,'' Ms. Chen said, ''and we said: 'Cool. More fish. Give us more fish!' ''</p>
