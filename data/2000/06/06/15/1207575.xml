        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The ''research'' you reported on for online used-book sales was both inadequate and inaccurate. I am one of those book dealers on the Advanced Book Exchange and assure you that on those few occasions when I have changed the price of a book when listing it on abebooks.com, it has been to lower it. Since any buyer who searches a title sees every price listed, I prefer to be competitive in this market rather than pricing myself out of it. I have customers who both come in person to buy at my shop, Pomander Books, and also order from my abebooks.com listings, and I would find it reprehensible to charge two prices for the same book.</p>
