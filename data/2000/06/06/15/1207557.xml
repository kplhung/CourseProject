        <p>An estimated 45,000 fans turned out tonight to salute the Stanley Cup champion Devils outside Continental Arena as uncertainty surrounded the team's future.</p>
        <p>The YankeeNets combine will take over the team on July 12, and the fates of the Devils' president and general manager, Lou Lamoriello, and their coach, Larry Robinson, are unclear. The future of Lamoriello is the first question that must be answered by the new ownership.</p>
        <p>When Robinson's turn came to speak tonight to the wildly enthusiastic crowd, which was chanting ''four more years,'' he put some pressure on YankeeNets.</p>
        <p>''I promise you one thing,'' Robinson said. ''If Lou Lamoriello is the manager, Larry Robinson will be the coach.''</p>
        <p>As a minority owner, it is estimated that Lamoriello will receive about $8 million from the sale of the team. Some observers have indicated that he wants to stay now that the team has captured the Stanley Cup and wants to leave a legacy of winning multiple cups. A strong foundation of core players with an excellent blend of experience and youth gives the Devils a good chance for success.</p>
        <p>Lamoriello refused to address the matter tonight. ''This function is all I want to talk about,'' he said of the victory celebration.</p>
        <p>On this night of celebration for the Devils' second Stanley Cup in six seasons, the only certainty was that it was McMullen's last hurrah with the team. The 82-year-old McMullen bought the team for $33 million 18 years ago and moved it from Denver to New Jersey as a service to his native state. He will also be paid an additional $1 million for the Stanley Cup victory. McMullen reportedly plans to divide the bonus among the front office personnel.</p>
        <p>''It's an emotional time,'' McMullen said, ''because it's the last function with the team, the last time everybody is together.''</p>
        <p>Every player interviewed tonight said he was happy to see McMullen walk away as champion.</p>
        <p>''It was something that went through my mind as we were going through each series in the playoffs,'' said Ken Daneyko, who has played in every playoff game in the history of the Devils.</p>
        <p>McMullen said he was forced to sell the team and was deeply disappointed that he did not get any help from the state to build an arena for the Devils in Hoboken. He went so far as to call Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's position on the matter a betrayal.</p>
        <p>''You think people are your friends and it's disappointing not to be appreciated,'' McMullen said. ''The governor disappointed me.''</p>
        <p>While all the members of the Devils were showered with affection when introduced, Whitman was jeered loudly when she was introduced for a brief speech.</p>
        <p>The celebration is not over for Daneyko and Scott Gomez. Those two will be in Toronto on Thursday night for the league's awards ceremony. Gomez is likely to win the Calder Trophy as the league's rookie of the year, and Daneyko is a candidate for the Masterton Trophy, which goes to the player with the most perseverance, dedication and sportsmanship.</p>
        <p>Lamoriello and the team captain, Scott Stevens, will accompany Gomez and Daneyko.</p>
