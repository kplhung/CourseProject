        <p>After night falls and yawning villages like this one finally settle into sleep, Evelyn Masaiti, an opposition candidate, and three of her volunteers creep into a battered 1981 Peugeot. Through a crack in the car window, they send hundreds of campaign flyers fluttering among the thatched houses as their gray jalopy sputters along the dark, winding roads.</p>
        <p>Even by Mrs. Masaiti's calculations, this is a strategy of desperation, not efficiency. With less than two weeks to go before Zimbabwe's parliamentary elections, her chief opponent, Mandi Chimene, a government official from the ruling party, is holding daily rallies in dusty shopping centers, plastering her portrait on tree trunks and wooing the local chiefs.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Masaiti, a 35-year-old science teacher, cannot hold rallies or wear political party T-shirts or even hang party posters during the day without risk. Last month, angry thugs killed a man because they believed he supported her, the police said. And two weeks ago, a mob torched the houses of dozens of opposition party members in broad daylight, leaving about 90 people homeless, including Mrs. Masaiti's in-laws.</p>
        <p>On the television screens in the capital, Harare, this country's first heated race for Parliament is depicted mostly as a contest between two men, President Robert Mugabe and his chief rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition party leader.</p>
        <p>But the real battle is fought far from the cameras, in rural hamlets like this one, where little-known opposition candidates are struggling to spread their message in a campaign characterized by intimidation and political violence.</p>
        <p>Since March, at least 26 people have been killed and 150 have been injured, most of them black supporters of Mr. Tsvangirai's new party, the Movement for Democratic Change. And this week, Amnesty International, a human rights group, accused the government of either instigating or condoning the attacks, echoing some Western observers who have warned that the climate of fear has made free and fair elections unlikely.</p>
        <p>Government officials deny that they have orchestrated or supported the intimidation, but they acknowledge that the political stakes have never been higher. For the first time in this nation's 20-year history, opposition candidates are contesting all  120 parliamentary seats that are up for election and some officials have conceded that they will likely lose their nearly total grip on power after the vote, which is scheduled for June 24 and 25.</p>
        <p>The ruling party, which currently controls all but three seats in the 150-member Parliament, expects to lose many of the 30-odd seats in the urban centers, where opposition candidates campaign freely and residents are weary of chronic fuel shortages, skyrocketing inflation and official corruption. (In Zimbabwe, the public elects only 120 of the 150 members of Parliament. The president chooses 20 and local chiefs choose 10.)</p>
        <p>So the fiercest battles burn in the countryside, traditionally the stronghold of Mr. Mugabe's party and home to most of this nation's 5.1 million registered voters. And here, in this lush valley of sugar cane fields and lemon trees, the contest between Mrs. Masaiti and Mrs. Chimene, the regional officer for the government's central intelligence agency, quickly turned ugly.</p>
        <p>Last month, the police arrested 38 supporters of the ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, on charges of public violence for burning the houses of the M.D.C. supporters, according to Inspector Francis Mupvuta, a spokesman for the provincial police department here.</p>
        <p>At least two ruling party members have been arrested for the murder of the man who was suspected of supporting Mrs. Masaiti, Mr. Mupvuta said. And five M.D.C. supporters have been charged with kidnapping a ruling party supporter.</p>
        <p>The charred houses and blackened fields stand as a vivid reminder of the most recent rampage. The flames swallowed almost everything, leaving metal pots and cups half melted and devouring clothing and much of the precious harvest. Mrs. Masaiti pushes through the tall grass and points as chickens pick through the rubble.</p>
        <p>''If I had not started with this politics, they would not have been affected,'' she said. ''I lie in bed thinking about these people who have no shelter, no food. They just finished harvesting. What will they be feeding their children?</p>
        <p>''We are afraid now that people will not go to vote. They need a change, but they're intimidated. We need to remove that fear. We need to tell them, 'Your vote is your secret.' ''</p>
        <p>But when asked how she planned to get that message out, Mrs. Masaiti sighed and described her late-night drive into the community. ''When they wake up in the morning, the people will see the flyers,'' she said. ''It's not the best method, but there's no alternative.''</p>
        <p>It is difficult to know exactly how pervasive such violence is in rural communities. Election observers from the European Union, the British Commonwealth and other groups are still fanning out across the country and the government and the M.D.C. are still bickering over the precise number of deaths. The M.D.C. says at least 30 people have died in political clashes while the state-controlled press reports that at least 26 have died.</p>
        <p>Ruling party members have also been victims of political attacks although few have been killed. And in recent days, government officials, who had publicly defended retaliatory attacks against white farmers and opposition members, have repeatedly urged their supporters to avoid violence, using the state-controlled media to spread the word.</p>
        <p>''The government is doing what it must do to keep the peace,'' said Jonathan Moyo, a spokesman for the ruling party, who blames the opposition for provoking the wave of violence. ''The fact that the violence has occurred is, at the end of the day, neither here nor there. The police have taken very clear and decisive measures to deal with the violence. The leadership has spoken against violence and continues to do so. We condemn violence.''</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Masaiti worries that the calls for peace may have come too late for this rural constituency, where most of the 35,000 black voters scrape by without telephones, flush toilets and electricity. In February, in an astonishing rebuke to the ruling party, this community and the nation voted against a constitutional referendum that would have expanded President Mugabe's power.</p>
        <p>The vote reflected the community's frustration with the unraveling economy and the soaring costs of basics goods like bread, cornmeal and paraffin. ''The M.D.C. might just win because the cost of living has gone so high,'' said one 38-year-old woman, who sells milk for a living and has long supported the ruling party, which brought independence to Zimbabwe. ''We cannot afford to buy what we need.''</p>
        <p>But the market woman was too afraid to give her name. The only reason her houses were not burned, she said, was because she does not own any M.D.C. T-shirts. The local police here offer little protection, she says, and these days, people are whispering that government supporters will open the ballot boxes on election day and attack anyone who voted for the opposition. ''If I give my name,'' the woman said, ''they might hear and come for me at night.''</p>
        <p>Inspector Mupvuta, the spokesman for the provincial police force, hesitated when asked whether the local police in Mutasa were adequately protecting opposition supporters here. He suggested there might be personality problems between Mrs. Masaiti and the local officers, which might explain why the provincial police, not the local police, have made arrests in the public violence cases.</p>
        <p>He emphasized that the police are supposed to be neutral, not partisan. But he said he understood Mrs. Masaiti's fears. ''These people who burned the houses, they are out on bail again,'' Inspector Mupvuta said. ''Obviously she's going to be afraid.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Chimene, the 40-year-old ruling party candidate, dismisses such talk. She blames the opposition for instigating violence in an effort to smear her reputation. And she accuses Mrs. Masaiti of making excuses to cover up her lack of support.</p>
        <p>''I'm doing rallies and meetings almost every day and the people gather in groups, in crowds of 500 people,'' Mrs. Chimene said. ''It's not that it's difficult for her to campaign. It's that she has no support. There's no fear of any sort. The people are just not interested in the M.D.C.</p>
        <p>''We are out educating our people,'' she said. ''The people now know that they were taking the wrong route with the constitutional referendum. They want to correct that, correct that mistake.''</p>
        <p>Some relatives worry that Mrs. Masaiti made the mistake by wading into the political fray.</p>
        <p>In May, she was forced to quit her teaching job under new rules that  bar civil servants from running for office. She now has to wait two years to reapply for the post. It was a hard choice to make, particularly because she and her husband, a taxi driver, were already struggling to buy three meals a day.</p>
        <p>But with the election day nearing, Mrs. Masaiti says there is little time to worry about the future. She is too busy consulting with her homeless supporters, who sleep under trees and in a large tent, and assessing whether they can risk holding a rally or distributing flyers on public jitneys.</p>
        <p>''Even if I don't win, I will survive,'' said Mrs. Masaiti, taking a break from her open-air strategy session. ''I will sell cold drinks from home or sew. I can sew some bedspreads, nice bedspreads. But I can't worry about that now.''</p>
