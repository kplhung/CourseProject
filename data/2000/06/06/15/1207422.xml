        <p>Religious patronage of architecture is alive in Garden Grove, Calif., where the religious broadcaster Dr. Robert H. Schuller (inset), 73, oversees a 38-acre homage to design. His latest project, a $20 million visitors center he likes to call the International Center for Possibility Thinking (drawing, above), is being built beside Philip Johnson's Crystal Cathedral (1981) and Richard Neutra's Tower of Hope (1968). Dr. Schuller, whose program, ''Hour of Power,'' attracts millions of viewers, bought and bulldozed 38 private residences to make room for the center, designed by Richard Meier. How did a pastor become the Lorenzo de' Medici of American architecture -- or, as he put it, ''hooked on architecture of the highest league''? ''Architecture should not only be elegant but also eloquent,'' Dr. Schuller said. ''People come onto our property and say what a wonderful feeling this is.''</p>
