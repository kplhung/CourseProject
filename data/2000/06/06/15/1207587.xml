        <p>The Legislature approved a bill today making New York the first state to impose fire-safety standards on cigarettes, striking a deal with Gov. George E. Pataki three weeks after he vetoed a similar bill.</p>
        <p>The Senate and the Assembly also passed a bill strengthening criminal penalties for cigarette bootlegging, and restricting cigarette sales on the Internet, a measure Mr. Pataki had demanded in return for signing the fire-safety bill. State officials are concerned that bootlegging and the Internet are increasingly being used to avoid paying the state's cigarette tax of $1.11 a pack, the highest in the country.</p>
        <p>The new fire-safety bill, which the governor pledged to sign, requires that all cigarettes sold in New York meet flammability standards by mid-2003. The goal is to have cigarettes, the leading cause of accidental fires, go out after a short time if they are not being puffed, rather than burning continually.</p>
        <p>Cigarettes are the leading cause of fatal fires in New York, resulting in 48 fire deaths statewide in 1997, the most recent year for which detailed figures are available, according to the State Office of Fire Prevention and Control.</p>
        <p>''This is the first time tobacco products have ever been regulated in any significant way, anywhere in the United States,'' said Russell Sciandra, director of the Center for a Tobacco-Free New York, drawing a distinction between regulation of sales and of content. ''This now sets a huge precedent. Finally, cigarettes are being treated as a consumer product like anything else.''</p>
        <p>New York's actions have been closely watched by antismoking groups, the tobacco industry and lawmakers in other states, including California, where similar bills are pending. Antismoking advocates predict that New York's adoption of the law will prod other states to act, which, in turn, will persuade Congress to adopt national standards for cigarette flammability.</p>
        <p>''I think this law makes national standards inevitable,'' said Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat who was the chief sponsor of the bill in the Assembly.</p>
        <p>The tobacco industry has suggested strongly that it may ask Congress to impose a national standard devised by the industry.</p>
        <p>Tobacco companies have experimented with less-flammable cigarettes for two decades, and have registered more than 100 patents for making them. Congress has debated the issue of requiring them for nearly as long, and produced a lengthy study of the issue seven years ago, but no bill on the topic has ever passed in either house.</p>
        <p>New York is among the states where the new cigarettes are being  test-marketed under several brand names. The cigarettes cost the same as others, and research has found that smokers cannot detect a difference in taste.</p>
        <p>Cigarette makers, which have opposed state legislation, responded cautiously today, saying that they needed to review the bill.</p>
        <p>''We support the development of a fire-safety standard, but we believe that a national standard is preferable to 50 potentially conflicting state standards,'' said Kati Otto, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris U.S.A.</p>
        <p>Steve Kottak, a spokesman for Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation, said that less-flammable cigarettes ''could have adverse health effects on smokers,'' because complying with flammability rules could mean changing the composition of the cigarette.</p>
        <p>Anti-tobacco groups point to studies by other cigarette manufacturers showing that the less-flammable cigarettes pose no greater risk to the smoker than the old ones.</p>
        <p>The bill was modified, at the governor's insistence, to require the Health Department and the Office of Fire Prevention and Control to consider whether altering cigarettes to make them less incendiary would also make them more dangerous to smoke. It does not say how the agencies should investigate the matter, or what action should be taken if adverse health effects are found.</p>
        <p>Antismoking advocates contend that the health concern is a false one, raised by tobacco companies to cover their true fear: that if cigarettes stop burning on their own, they can be relighted, and smokers will smoke fewer of them, cutting into sales.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki reached agreement on the bills today with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, after weeks of intensive negotiations and  with the end of this year's legislative session looming. The bills were hurriedly printed and passed unanimously by both houses.</p>
        <p>''It seems we finally made it,'' said Senator Frank Padavan, a Queens Republican who sponsored the bill for years before it finally came to a vote this year. ''And with the bootlegging bill, it's probably a better package than when we started.''</p>
        <p>Today was scheduled to be the last day of the session, though the Assembly will convene Thursday and for at least one day next week. Mr. Bruno has said he does not plan to have the Senate return after today, but he left open the possibility that it will, if agreement is reached on a number of important bills that are still under negotiation, including a gun control package and an overhaul of sex crime laws.</p>
        <p>For an industry once seen as politically invulnerable, today's actions continue a string of recent defeats, including the $246 billion settlement to compensate states for tobacco-related health care, increases in state and federal cigarette taxes, and the first successful lawsuits by smokers.</p>
        <p>For more than a month after the Legislature passed a fire-safety bill in April, Mr. Pataki gave no indication of what he thought of it. Then, when he had only 48 hours left to act on it, he demanded several changes, as well as passage of the bootlegging bill.</p>
        <p>Legislators protested that the governor was asking them to cover too much ground in so little time, and some accused him of looking for reasons not to sign the bill. On May 24, he vetoed it and promptly came under intense criticism from antismoking groups and newspaper editorial boards.</p>
        <p>The bill passed today does not set a specific standard for how quickly a cigarette must snuff itself out, leaving that decision to the state's Office of Fire Prevention and Control. The bill directs that office to issue rules by Jan. 1, 2003, and requires that all cigarettes sold in the state abide by those rules within six months, or by July 1, 2003, at the latest.</p>
        <p>That final effective date is a year later than the one in the version passed by the Legislature in April, one of several changes made at the insistence of Mr. Pataki.</p>
        <p>The bill contains another feature sought by the governor, one that imposes a $500 fine on a retailer who sells cigarettes that do not meet the safety standards, or $1,000 for a sale of five cartons or more of such cigarettes. Retailers could also lose their state lottery franchises. A wholesaler would be fined $10,000.</p>
        <p>Bootlegging -- shipping cigarettes into New York without paying state taxes -- is a misdemeanor carrying a sentence of up to a year in jail. The bootlegging bill approved today would make repeat violations a felony, punishable by up to four years in prison. It also provides for fines, varying with the size of the shipment, up to $100 per carton for large loads. Those penalties will go into effect 90 days after the governor signs the bill.</p>
        <p>The bill also makes it illegal for an Internet seller to ship cigarettes directly to a customer, an increasingly popular method that not only evades taxes, but can be used by minors to buy cigarettes.</p>
        <p>Instead, the seller would have to ship them to a licensed retailer, like a store, and the customer would pick them up there, showing proof of age and paying the tax.</p>
        <p>Tobacco companies have questioned whether that provision of the  bill is unconstitutional interference with interstate commerce.</p>
