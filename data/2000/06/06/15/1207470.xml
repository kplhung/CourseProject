        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''No Level Field for Athletes in Schools,'' by Joyce Purnick (Metro Matters column, June 8):</p>
        <p>The column suggests that the city neglects athletic facilities for public schools. But the city provides the Board of Education with $11 billion a year. City Hall has no authority on how that money is spent. Somewhere in all those billions there is money for more athletic facilities, if only the board considered them a priority.</p>
        <p>Ms. Purnick says the new Staten Island minor-league baseball complex will cost $71 million. She adds that this financing includes ''local improvements like a new esplanade.'' That's a funny way to characterize a complete renovation of the St. George Ferry Terminal; the construction of the National Lighthouse Museum and the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences; and new roads and commuter parking lots, among other things.</p>
