        <p>Let's begin with a generalization: the main difference between going to a concert in Manhattan or in Hollywood is the intent. In Manhattan, most people go to a concert because the act is good or interesting or has been recommended by a trustworthy source. In Hollywood, most people seem to be attending shows because the acts are on the pop charts, seeking to land on the pop charts or predicted to make the pop charts. Or they buy tickets (more accurately, land on the guest list) because the performers are acquaintances of a friend or in business with a friend.</p>
        <p>Manhattan is a cultural capital, where an overheard conversation on the subway is as likely to be about Andrei Tarkovsky as Steven Spielberg, Diamanda Galas as Britney Spears. But Los Angeles is an industry town, pumping out audience-tested dreams to please the world: what is the point of making a movie or music, runs the logic in Tinseltown, if it isn't created in the most current style with the intention of entertaining the widest audience possible?</p>

        <p>Manhattan is a cultural capital, where an overheard conversation on the subway is as likely to be about Andrei Tarkovsky as Steven Spielberg, Diamanda Galas as Britney Spears. But Los Angeles is an industry town, pumping out audience-tested dreams to please the world: what is the point of making a movie or music, runs the logic in Tinseltown, if it isn't created in the most current style with the intention of entertaining the widest audience possible?</p>
        <p>Enter the Knitting Factory.</p>
        <p>For 13 years, the Knitting Factory has been a catalyst and focal point for avant-garde music in Manhattan,  a home (though admittedly not always a happy one, but what homes are?) for downtown composers and improvisers, for European avant-gardists and left-of-center rock bands and for galvanizing series of  experimental klezmer music and silent-film accompaniment.</p>
        <p>Now the Knitting Factory is coming here, opening a high-tech club smack dab in the middle of Hollywood in hopes (multimillion-dollar hopes) that there is a large enough audience for avant-garde music here to support it. The club was supposed to have opened this month and had already booked concerts with New Yorkers like Arto Lindsay and Luna  and Los Angelenos like Vinny Golia and Petra Haden, but construction  problems have delayed its start until early July.</p>
        <p>''I've had a lot of agents in L.A. tell me, 'That John Zorn garbage won't play out here,' but I've taken it with a grain of salt,'' said Glen Max, who is overseeing music bookings at the Knitting Factory in Manhattan and  Hollywood.</p>
        <p>And what are his thoughts on the subject? ''I'm not sure,'' he said. ''We won't know until we start presenting it, but hopefully if we present it with enough enthusiasm and make it a really good experience, there will be an audience.''</p>
        <p>Typically, new music in Los Angeles has had trouble finding a home. It is presented perhaps once a week, usually on off nights (like the Monday night series at the now defunct Alligator Lounge), and its bookers are typically forced to change venues often, floating from art gallery to club to community center in search of a tolerant host.</p>
        <p>''I think the Knitting Factory for at least a little while because of its name will generate a certain amount of interest and success,'' said Alex Cline, a percussionist and curator of  a new music series at the Eagle Rock Community Cultural Center on the east side of Los Angeles. ''But when they find out that some of these people don't draw, I don't know whether they'll pull the plug or not.''</p>
        <p>There are all types of avant-garde scenes in Los Angeles, from mix-and-match improvisers like G. E. Stinson to ambient texturalists like Solid State to older statesmen like Don Preston, who played with Frank Zappa. But most attract the type of crowd that will make the main room at the Knitting Factory here (which will seat 400) seem awfully lonely.  Even the top-drawing musician in Los Angeles's current avant-garde, the guitarist Nels Cline, brings in only about 200 people on a good night  at a popular club like the Troubadour.</p>
        <p>J. Ray, a booker at Spaceland, a club in the Silverlake area, sometimes books improvisers, experimentalists, and sound-searchers. But since those acts leave plenty of space in his club, which seats 250, he wonders how the Knitting Factory will fare. ''Wow, that will be interesting,'' he said when he heard of the Knitting Factory's plans to book acts that are more extreme than underground rockers and songwriters. ''I think that's a New York thing. This is the land of rock. But if it does work for them, I'd be stoked.''</p>
        <p>The hope for the Knitting Factory  Hollywood, said Michael Dorf, owner of both, is that the club will find the same kind of luck that its original space in Manhattan did: it opened as a rock club, but was adopted by musicians like Mr. Zorn and Elliott Sharp, whose careers rose simultaneously with the reputation of the Knitting Factory in Manhattan. He  said he hoped that in Los Angeles, where there is certainly no shortage of musicians, a similar scene might ''come out of the woodwork.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Dorf said he wanted Knitting Factory Hollywood to be more than an avant-garde club: the place will feature two performance spaces, a small lounge and restaurant, plenty of rock bands that are well loved on college radio, an annual jazz festival with stages on Hollywood Boulevard and computers and Internet connections galore so that Mr. Dorf can link up all the clubs he is planning to open, with Berlin next on the itinerary. Mr. Dorf has even rented a house a few miles away from the club so that he can fly in Knitting Factory regulars from downtown Manhattan for extended residencies.</p>
        <p>And while many Los Angeles musicians are awaiting the arrival of the Knitting Factory with a combination of excitement and trepidation (especially when it comes to the club's relatively corporate attitude), they know that whatever happens, the music will survive.</p>
        <p>''The scene has historically been about self-determination,'' Mr. Cline  said. ''And while I think of the Knitting Factory as a positive thing because it will draw more attention to what's going on here, I don't think of it as East Coast deities coming in on their chariot and saving new music in Los Angeles.''</p>
        <p>In some ways, he added, it is odd that the Knitting Factory chose Hollywood as its second home -- not because of the lack of a cohesive arts audience here, but the lack of a cohesive city. On a busy weekend night, driving into Hollywood for a show can be an ordeal more challenging than any avant-garde music the Knitting Factory might book.</p>
