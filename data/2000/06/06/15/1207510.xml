        <p>To his colleagues, Stephen E. Gardell was a detective who filed for retirement only months ago after working his way up the ranks during a 30-year career in the New York Police Department and serving nearly a decade as the treasurer of the Detectives Endowment Association.</p>

        <p>To his colleagues, Stephen E. Gardell was a detective who filed for retirement only months ago after working his way up the ranks during a 30-year career in the New York Police Department and serving nearly a decade as the treasurer of the Detectives Endowment Association.</p>
        <p>But to federal authorities, Detective Gardell, 52, was a traitor to his shield, a law enforcement officer who not only broke the law, but who broke it on behalf of one of the government's most persistent enemies -- the mob. The authorities say he helped members of the Bonanno and Colombo crime families carry out the largest securities fraud in United States history.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Gardell was charged with running interference for a host of gangsters in the fraud, acting as mobster mole inside the fortress of the law.</p>
        <p>An indictment returned in Federal District Court in Manhattan accused Dectective Gardell of crimes ranging from funneling his union's pension money into stock schemes manipulated by the mob to helping mobsters obtain official permits to carry firearms. The charges against him are both petty and severe. The government says he curried favor with organized crime by tipping off gangsters about investigations and by trying to influence inquiries into the mob. The government also says he even helped his gangland associates get police department parking stickers.</p>
        <p>In exchange, Detective Gardell was said to have been handsomely paid by the mob. He received ''cash and property from organized crime figures,'' the indictment said, including $8,000 for construction of a swimming pool at his home, free or steeply discounted hotel rooms at casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City as well as a fur coat.</p>
        <p>Detective Thomas J. Scotto, who has been the president of the Detectives Endowment Association since 1986, said the accusations that Detective Gardell had worked with people on the other side of the law were ''bizarre.''</p>
        <p>Detective Scotto added: ''I find it almost impossible to believe that he would have engaged in any such kind of activity.''</p>
        <p>The scheme to pour the union's pension fund into mob-manipulated stocks would never have worked, Detective Scotto said, because four other people would have had to agree to any transactions recommended by Detective Gardell. ''It's an impossibility,'' Detective Scotto said. ''We never get involved in these little rinky-dink investment outfits that were mentioned in this indictment.''</p>
        <p>Detective Gardell's lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, disputed the charges. ''At this point,'' Mr. Tacopina said of his client, ''all I can say is that he adamantly maintains his innocence.''</p>
