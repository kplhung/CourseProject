        <p>The Broadway musical, ever in search of the shows that will expand its traditional audience into hipper or younger (or both) sectors of the populace, pushed forward this past season with ''Contact,'' ''James Joyce's 'The Dead' '' and ''The Wild Party,'' all of which offered innovation in form or tone. Now in Southern California, three nascent works are trying to lure new (and old) theatergoers by energizing the traditional form with the force of pop culture in general and rock 'n' roll in particular. They vary in their achievement, but they all project at least one welcome idea: the world of pop is stageable, a tap-worthy vein of material.</p>
        <p>All three of the productions are in the midst of world-premiere runs. At the South Coast Repertory Theater here in Costa Mesa, ''The Education of Randy Newman'' is a kind of stage biography of the popular singer, with a narrative built on the bittersweet and wryly acid songs that have characterized his career. An hour to the south in San Diego, the San Diego Repertory Theater is presenting ''Celebration of the Lizard,'' a post-apocalyptic tale based on the writings of the rock icon Jim Morrison and featuring 33 songs originally recorded by his band, the Doors. Meanwhile, also in San Diego, the Old Globe Theater is putting on ''The Full Monty,'' an adaptation of the hit British film comedy of 1997 about a half-dozen laid-off mill workers who resort to stripping to earn a quick and necessary buck.</p>

        <p>The Broadway musical, ever in search of the shows that will expand its traditional audience into hipper or younger (or both) sectors of the populace, pushed forward this past season with ''Contact,'' ''James Joyce's 'The Dead' '' and ''The Wild Party,'' all of which offered innovation in form or tone. Now in Southern California, three nascent works are trying to lure new (and old) theatergoers by energizing the traditional form with the force of pop culture in general and rock 'n' roll in particular. They vary in their achievement, but they all project at least one welcome idea: the world of pop is stageable, a tap-worthy vein of material.</p>
        <p>All three of the productions are in the midst of world-premiere runs. At the South Coast Repertory Theater here in Costa Mesa, ''The Education of Randy Newman'' is a kind of stage biography of the popular singer, with a narrative built on the bittersweet and wryly acid songs that have characterized his career. An hour to the south in San Diego, the San Diego Repertory Theater is presenting ''Celebration of the Lizard,'' a post-apocalyptic tale based on the writings of the rock icon Jim Morrison and featuring 33 songs originally recorded by his band, the Doors. Meanwhile, also in San Diego, the Old Globe Theater is putting on ''The Full Monty,'' an adaptation of the hit British film comedy of 1997 about a half-dozen laid-off mill workers who resort to stripping to earn a quick and necessary buck.</p>
        <p>A hot ticket, ''The Full Monty,'' directed by Jack O'Brien with a broader humor than in Peter Cattaneo's film, is the most accomplished of the three. It is headed for Broadway in the fall -- not surprising considering that Mr. O'Brien, the artistic director of the Old Globe, and the book writer, Terrence McNally, both have Broadway pedigrees. Fox Searchlight, the division of 20th Century Fox that released the film and that will finance the $7 million Broadway production, has also helped the Old Globe set the show on its infant feet. To judge from a recent performance, it is a crowd-pleaser, with audience members leaping up during the final striptease and hooting for the characters to show it all.</p>
        <p>It's a little early in the game for serious carping -- John Arnone's lighthearted sets are zippy and functional but could make use of some of that Broadway money, and at three hours the show is overlong, leaning on Mr. McNally's dialogue-heavy book, which seems likely to be streamlined -- but a few observations won't hurt.</p>
        <p>The music and lyrics are by David Yazbek, a stage newcomer with a rock background. His wordplay is sophisticated, his sensibility brusquely unsentimental and occasionally risky. (A Motown-flavored rock song called ''Big Black Man'' pokes fun at an egregious racial stereotype by indulging it.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Yazbek writes in a variety of pop modes, from a jazzy big-band overture to a country-ish lament sung by a father to the son he feels he is failing. There is at least one knockout song: ''Scrap,'' a jangly and jarring lament sung by a chorus of the bitterly unemployed. And Mr. Yazbek knows the traditions of his medium enough that he has written a handful of numbers that would be at home nowhere but in musical theater, including a sweet and funny duet by two husbands romantically serenading the obsessions that rule their lives. One sings to his spendthrift wife, the other to his fat belly (''You grumble/And I stumble/Toward the Muenster cheese.'')</p>
        <p>Among the surprises for those who fondly remember the movie are augmented roles for three of the characters' wives and the invention of another female character, a crusty old piano player who comes out of retirement to accompany the boys in their striptease. But the most significant change is the relocation of the story from Sheffield, England, to Buffalo -- ostensibly so the show would feel more familiar to American audiences -- and with it a change in attitude.</p>
        <p>The characters in the film, out of work and desperate, remained fundamentally gentle; they wore their uncertain plight rather meekly. In the musical they are brasher and angrier and, in the case of the male lead, played by Patrick Wilson, capable of blunt aggression; he walks an interesting line between lovable and loutish.</p>
        <p>The show is full of penis jokes, casual obscenity, pelvic thrusting, even gay baiting, but it is able to codify its attitude in a sunny enough manner, particularly in the rousing dance number that ends the first act, choreographed by Jerry Mitchell on a basketball theme. The song is called ''Michael Jordan's Ball,'' and it lionizes Mr. Jordan -- Mr. America indeed! -- for his ability to seize a game and make it his own.</p>
        <p>Neither of the other two shows has as assured a future, but ''The Education of Randy Newman'' might well enjoy an extended life, particularly with its pretension checked and maybe presented in a more intimate setting than on the South Coast Rep main stage. Using an ambitious literary model, ''The Education of Henry Adams,'' for its spirit if not its actual form, the show purports to tell the songwriter's life story in the context of his historical times by knitting 40 or so of his songs into a loose narrative.</p>
        <p>As conceived by Mr. Newman, Jerry Patch and Michael Roth, staged by Myron Johnson and performed by a seven-piece band and a strong cast of seven actor-singers upon whom the physical demands are considerable, the show works better than you might think -- at least for a while. Most of the opening act concerns Mr. Newman's upbringing in New Orleans, and the songs -- including the mocking satire, ''Rednecks,'' and the tongue-in-cheek paean to Huey Long, ''Kingfish'' -- provide the kind of specificity of time and place that good storytelling requires. Perhaps the best number is ''Four Eyes,'' about the social travails of a young boy with glasses, and Mr. Johnson has staged it here as a nightmarish first day of school. Over all, Mr. Newman's upbringing feels satisfyingly singular.</p>
        <p>In the second act, however, the action moves to Los Angeles, where the path of Mr. Newman's adulthood seems pretty familiar, if not downright generic: heartbreak and divorce, obsession with money, profligate behavior, redemption in love as a sense of mortality sets in. The songs, many familiar, are perfectly fine, but they end up dividing easily into two categories, sweet and sarcastic, and a little of each goes a long way. A bit of a saccharine sheen begins to accrue by the end of the show's 2 hours 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>If one of the themes is that Los Angeles inflates one's sense of oneself, well, here's a case in point. Mr. Newman's life story, modest and wry, might be better served with less aggrandizement -- fewer songs, simpler orchestrations (the music was most informative and touching when played by Mr. Roth on solo piano), a smaller house.</p>
        <p>Alas, no such solution is likely to perpetuate ''Celebration of the Lizard,'' which takes seriously not only the music of Jim Morrison, with the lascivious thrum that made him a rock star, but also the anti-establishment defiance that made him a hippie icon.</p>
        <p>The book, by Joel Lipman, is drawn from Morrison's own self-righteous writings, telling a futuristic story about a Mad Max-type hero on the run from the fascist authorities who encounters a tribe of hostile renegades in the desert. It is often laughably ponderous, a condition underscored by the reverent spirit of Sam Woodhouse's direction and the lead performance by Jeff Meek, a handsome guy who sings well enough to be the Morrison stand-in the part requires but who has none of Morrison's insolent charisma.</p>
        <p>The interesting thing is that the music is as alive and enthralling as it ever was, and the chief pleasure of this production is in the moments it is well adapted for the stage. Mr. Woodhouse, the artistic director of the San Diego Rep, has found apt context for three of the Doors' most famous songs. ''The End'' serves as a haunting dirge. ''People Are Strange'' accompanies Mr. Meek's first encounter with the spookily costumed desert tribe (the one laugh-inducing scene in the show). And, of course, there's ''Light My Fire,'' which is employed as a first-act finale, beginning as a love duet enacted by two separate couples and ending with the entire ensemble communing around a glowing campfire.</p>
        <p>In those scenes, we get a glimpse of the Doors as theater folk. Maybe they're not Lerner and Loewe, but who would've thought?</p>
