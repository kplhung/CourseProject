        <p>THE Maurer family -- Mike, Susan and their children, Ellen and Chad -- love their vacation condominium in Bellaire, Mich., four hours north of their suburban Detroit home. What they don't love is getting there.</p>
        <p>''The kids hate the ride,'' Mr. Maurer said. ''They fight because they hate being in the car for four hours. They fight over territory, or what's on the radio. They just fight over anything.'' Officiating the battles left the parents frazzled as well.</p>
        <p>But all that changed early this year when the couple bought a Ford Windstar minivan with the newest option: a console with color television, VCR and Nintendo nestled between the front seats, facing the back-seat passengers.</p>
        <p>''We saw it, drove it, liked it, and the kids loved it right off the bat,'' Mr. Maurer said.</p>
        <p>Now the family's northern jaunts are placid. ''This has been the best thing that has ever happened,'' Mr. Maurer said. ''The kids are occupied, we can talk, and it's a much calmer ride.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Maurer is so impressed with the effect on family travel that he is considering spending $1,000 or more to install a similar system in his other car, a Ford Club Wagon, for times when he chauffeurs Ellen, who is 11, and Chad, 8.</p>
        <p>Entertainment centers, once strictly for the home, have hit the road, turning the minivan or sport utility vehicle into a family den on wheels. Since October 1999, when the television-VCR combination became a factory option, studies have shown it to be a high-demand accessory, said Frank Forkin, a partner in the automotive marketing and research firm J. D. Power &amp; Associates in Detroit.</p>
        <p>''All of the minivans and family-type S.U.V.'s either already have them as an option or have them on the drawing board,'' he said. And aftermarket installers can put them into almost anything on four wheels.</p>
        <p>The price of the entertainment systems usually tops $1,800, but now that they are an option offered at the dealership, buyers can rationalize the purchase more easily by rolling the cost in with the car financing.</p>
        <p>Chevrolet expected sales of a special-edition Warner Brothers Venture van, which features a television along with the company's logo and an image of Bugs Bunny, to account for about 10 percent of Venture's sales for the 2000 model year. It is actually accounting for about 20 percent of sales, a percentage that is expected to increase, said Pete Langenhorst, brand manager for the Venture. ''The growth potential is enormous,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some resourceful consumers are finding simple and cheap ways to put a television and a VCR in the car. But others are paying top dollar for fancy multizone systems, each  equipped with a separate L.C.D. flat screen (the kind in laptop computers) that can be mounted in the roof or can flip up from a console, or screens that are mounted on the back of the front-seat headrests. Those more expensive systems, which give the car's interior the look of a business-class cabin on a jumbo jet, can let the children play Nintendo or PlayStation video games while Mom listens to a CD and Dad tunes in a radio talk show. To avoid multimedia cacophony, all the passengers can wear earphones, but it is illegal for the driver to wear them. And some systems have controls in the front seat so parents can shut things off in a disciplinary crisis.</p>
        <p>But the prospect of such a crisis, among other things, leads some critics to question whether it might distract the driver to have people watching a favorite movie or playing Pokemon in the back seat, or whether a television could be a dangerous thing to have aboard in a car accident. Others debate whether it is wise to augment children's already heavy television consumption.</p>
        <p>Entertainment technology has been making the transition from the living room to the car since the 1920's and has been criticized as dangerous at each step along the way.</p>
        <p>In the 20's, do-it yourselfers installed tube radios in their cars, said Michael Lamm, who writes about automotive history. People could not listen to the radio as they drove because the firing of the spark plugs interfered with reception.</p>
        <p>''You drove to a high place where you would get good reception,'' Mr. Lamm said, ''you would take your girlfriend, and you would park and turn on the radio and it was a very romantic thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Earl Muntz, a legendary Los Angeles car salesman known as Madman Muntz, installed radios in the 30's that could play as the car drove, and states like Massachusetts  considered prohibiting radios in cars as a dangerous distraction. (Now, car televisions could fall under broad restrictions found in some states against things that could distract a driver. But as long as they are not in the front seat, they are generally in safe legal territory.)</p>
        <p>Chrysler somewhat unsuccessfully offered a car phonograph in the 50's. ''If you hit a big bump, you'd know it,'' Mr. Lamm said. Although the reel-to-reel tape players never made it to the car as a standard option, eight-track tape players did in the late 1960's. ''Eight-tracks didn't last very long because they were so big and bulky,'' Mr. Lamm said. ''When the little cassettes came in, they did it in.''</p>
        <p>Car televisions are nothing new, of course. They were as common as shag carpet in conversion vans, popular in the 1970's. George Barris, known to some as King of the Kalifornia Kustomizers for his artistic car modifications, said he installed the first television in a car, in the dashboard of the 1953 Golden Sahara, a bubble-topped vehicle used in the Jerry Lewis movie ''Cinderfella.'' The Golden Sahara television was a home unit, Mr. Barris recalled. ''It was a Zenith, and we had the old Zenith remote control,'' he said. ''We also used the remote control to open the doors.'' He had to put a transformer in the car because the television functioned on 110-volt house current.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barris said televisions remained a popular option in the cars he modified. ''When the 12-volt unit became accessible in the 50's, it became easier to put in,'' he said. ''Now they are in all your S.U.V.'s, limousines -- we can do them any way you want now and hang them anywhere.''</p>
        <p>Some enterprising people simply adapt for car use small combination TV-VCR's that are designed for homes or camping and can be had for $200 to $300 apiece. Experts warn against that approach.</p>
        <p>''The problem is it is not permanently mounted,'' said Carl Mathews, director of merchandise at the Crutchfield Corporation, a mail-order electronics retailer based in Charlottesville, Va., ''and a TV can be a pretty dangerous projectile in an accident.''</p>
        <p>While some do-it-yourselfers suggest that a television can be secured by strapping it down or putting it in a milk crate that is  lashed to the seats, Mr. Mathews suggested the $599 Video Traveler, a monitor and VCR  in a bag that straps between the front seats.</p>
        <p>''It can be taken out and plugged into a wall socket and played in a hotel room,'' he said. It also has the advantage of a color L.C.D. screen, which is less dangerous in an accident than the glass vacuum tube used in many portable televisions.</p>
        <p>Virtually all of the entertainment units designed specifically for cars use L.C.D. screens. There are also floor-mounted entertainment units designed for the amateur installer; they are a step up from those that strap temporarily in place. A much bigger step up is the ceiling-mounted, flip-down television monitor, which is not recommended for amateur installers. The wiring has to run inside one of the car's roof support posts and in the ceiling cover.</p>
        <p>The ceiling-mounted televisions have some advantages. Although they may partly block the rear-view mirror, they will not keep a parent from reaching into the back seat, as some floor-mounted units can. And they may also be better for passengers who suffer from motion sickness.</p>
        <p>''What they are finding out is, kids are more likely to get sick looking down or level because when they look up they see the horizon in the peripheral vision,'' Mr. Langenhorst said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Charles M. Oman, a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has studied motion sickness for 25 years, agreed that seeing the horizon might help. When someone watches television or tries to read a newspaper in a car, he said, ''the motion you are experiencing does not match the brain's expectations -- you aren't creating the motion, and you don't have confirming visual cues.''</p>
        <p>But no matter where the screen is mounted, some people are simply prone to motion sickness. Susceptibility decreases as children mature so preteenagers are most likely to become ill. ''The one thing users of TV can do is sort of pace themselves, and if they feel queasy, look away,'' Dr. Oman said.</p>
        <p>Most mobile televisions use a VCR as the entertainment source, and many offer jacks for video game consoles. Manufacturers say more mobile DVD players are on the horizon, and they talk about a convergence of Internet, navigation and entertainment material, all accessible on the screen.</p>
        <p>As for watching television stations, some systems offer a tuner, although the signal is not very good in a moving vehicle. ''It's not going to be the quality TV you enjoy at home with cable,'' Mr. Mathews said.</p>
        <p>That's just as well, say some child-rearing experts, like Dr. Dorothy G. Singer of the Yale University Family Television Research Center. Although some bemoan the idea that television has invaded another treasured family ritual, Dr. Singer is not concerned that watching television or videos on trips will dangerously increase the time spent in front of the tube. But she does recommend that parents take along videotapes that are instructive and stimulating and that can be discussed as part of the ride.</p>
        <p>''I don't think if you are going on a four-hour or five-hour trip that you should have the TV on the whole time,'' she said. ''I think that is feeding into the 'TV is the baby sitter' attitude that we fall into.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Singer recommends that parents use television as a reward if the children play well together first. And that periods of watching television be broken up with periods of talking or listening to books on tape.</p>
        <p>''We put a book in and it really teases your imagination,'' she said. ''It's like old-time radio. Anything that stimulates the imagination is good, but when you watch TV, the images are provided for you.''</p>
        <p>Parents who want to heed her advice are in luck. Many entertainment systems, some using wireless headphones, can broadcast different programming to each person in the car. That works out well for Davis and Nancy Weaver and their teenage boys, Matthew and Mark.</p>
        <p>''The boys have trouble agreeing on the same entertainment,'' Mr. Weaver. Davis and Nancy Weaver have a similar problem:  Ms. Weaver likes the occasional Faith Hill CD, while Mr. Weaver likes to listen to sports on the radio. With a 30-hour drive from their home in Landenberg, Pa., to the Florida Keys ahead of them this summer, they found a solution in a top-of-the-line van with a multizone entertainment system that lets Mr. Weaver listen to the radio while his wife listens to music on a headset and the boys, also using headsets, watch a movie.</p>
        <p>''It's quiet in the car now,'' Mr. Weaver said. ''It's great. It's nice to take a long trip.'' And now that his oldest son can drive, Mr. Weaver will be able to spend some time watching the scenery and listening to his favorite music on a headset without torturing the family.</p>
        <p>''I'm a John Denver-type person,'' he said. ''My kids can't stand John Denver.''</p>
