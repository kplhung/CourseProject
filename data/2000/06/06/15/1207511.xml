Even if Seagram receives $77 a share in a deal with Vivendi of France, its performance would still trail the S.&amp; P. 500. Market Place. [C14.]</p>
        <p>Bear Stearns Net Profit Falls 40%  Bear Stearns said that its second-quarter profit fell 40 percent because of a slump in the bond market and a one-time $96 million charge stemming from a federal court judgment.

        <p>Frankel Fights Extradition to U.S.  Martin R. Frankel, the businessman accused of looting more than $200 million from insurance companies he acquired, made a concerted effort at a Hamburg courtroom, where he faces German charges of using false passports and evading customs duties on about $5 million worth of diamonds, to avoid extradition to the United States.
