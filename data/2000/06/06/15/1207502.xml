        <p>''I'VE painted four cows,'' Edwina Sandys, the artist and sculptor, is saying, of -- oh, why bother trying to stop ourselves; if you've been walking around town you can see it's going to be a very silly day -- her current cowmission.</p>
        <p>''The first was for the New York Public Library; it's called the Moobile Library. I have another cow for the SoHo and TriBeCa Partnerships. Then Peter Price, the head of Avenue magazine, asked me to do one for EdificeRex, the other for the magazine. 'Cowmoonication' and 'Herd on the Avenue.' He's going to put them in the Met Life building.''</p>
        <p>A little defensive here, in that brisk, British accent you expect when dealing with a granddaughter of Winston Churchill. But wry. ''I'm not going to spend my life with cows, only one cow leads to another.''</p>
        <p>Cows to our left, cows to our right: Cow Parade 2000 begins today, with 500 life-size cow sculptures (Holsteins) around town through summer.</p>
        <p>Enter also, Edwina Sandys (pronounced sands), who despite her concern about her reputation knows a good deal about fun.</p>
        <p>Witty -- that's the word often used for her work. A small sculpture, titled ''Marriage Bed,'' with a doll's bed that's half nails, half roses. Ms. Sandys also does sculpture on a large scale. Her 15-foot piece, ''Child,'' is in front of the United Nations International School. ''Christa,'' her sculpture of a female Jesus on the cross, made her the center of controversy in the early 80's. She has also done a sculpture from a section of the Berlin Wall.</p>
        <p>''She's very attractive, very intelligent and very daring,'' says Hans Janitschek, a correspondent for the Austrian paper Kronen Zeitung, who met Ms. Sandys at the Ritz Hotel in London in 1972, when he was secretary general of the Socialist International and she a Conservative, and they nonetheless became close friends. ''You always had the feeling she was up to something, and she was. And whether she has money or not, she will always manage. She has the ability to live in a castle like a big star or in a studio, which she did in New York, ordering from a Chinese restaurant around the corner.''</p>
        <p>Some colors pop, Ms. Sandys says. Orange and blue, also red and green. In addition, red is her primary color. Her hair is red. The linen shirt she's wearing over black tights and a black T-shirt is red. You enter Ms. Sandy's spectacular SoHo two-floor loft into a red alcove. If you stay for a few hours, bothering her with personal questions as she paints her cows -- Ms. Sandys is too polite to say it's time to leave -- you will see the deep red bathroom. Ms. Sandy's second husband, the architect Richard Kaplan, who works as an administrator of his family's J. M. Kaplan Fund, designed the apartment. Ms. Sands, who came to New York after her divorce in the 70's, is able to support herself with her work, but not, she concedes cheerfully, in this style.</p>
        <p>THERE are things Ms. Sandys does not like speaking about: her grandfather, who died when she was 23; the death of her mother, Diana, Churchill's eldest daughter, who committed suicide when Ms. Sandys was 24. ''They say there is no such thing as bad publicity,'' she says, half to herself toward the end of the interview, in the tone of one who is having doubts.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sandys's father was Lord Duncan Sandys, a British cabinet minister; she was presented to Queen Elizabeth as a debutante. Always artistic, Ms. Sandys worked briefly as an assistant to a dressmaker.</p>
        <p>Career plans?</p>
        <p>''I only knew that I wanted to marry, and um, I would like to marry an ambassador so I could be an ambassadress. So I could have a public life in some way. I assumed I would have an interesting life through a man. That's the way it used to be.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sandys married Piers Dixon, the son of the British ambassador to France, at 21, had two sons, then, still in her 20's, decided to run for a seat in Parliament. She gave that up when supporters of her husband, who was also planning a run, told her that wouldn't do.</p>
        <p>''They told him they were interested in couples only,'' Ms. Sandys says. ''They said it was as if they were having a big party and had hired a butler and a cook and at the last moment the cook did not turn up. They said, 'Tell your wife to get off the bus.' So I got off the bus. And into painting. And then we got a divorce.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sandy's wrote a novel, moved to Tuscany, where she had a home, then, running out of money, sold the house and came to New York. There will be a show at Egizio's Project in SoHo in November. She is also finishing a book called ''Penelope in Belgravia'' -- paintings she did in the 70's to which she has added a story line. ''Sometimes I feel like doing something totally outrageous,'' the married and wealthy heroine says. Was the heroine she? Perhaps a bit, she'll say.</p>
        <p>As for how she met her present husband, it's one personal story in which she delights: she needed a lift to the Hamptons, and he arrived to drive her out, bringing her the gift of a red rose tucked into a lettuce.</p>
        <p>''We fell in love that instant.''</p>
        <p>A day later comes a call, regarding Winston Churchill. ''Hey, you asked me to tell you something about my grandfather: he liked cows. That might be your final shot. He had a herd of, I think, belted Galloways. For aesthetic purposes, he liked the way they looked against the hillside.''</p>
        <p>Any other memories?</p>
        <p>''Now don't delve too much. And don't forget Egizio's Project; that's where I'll be in the fall.''</p>
