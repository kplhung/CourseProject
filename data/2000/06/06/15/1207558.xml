        <p>Four starts ago, Mike Hampton pitched a game that was delayed 211 minutes by rain. Last Sunday night, he had just struck out Paul O'Neill in the third inning when the heavens opened over Yankee Stadium, and 1 hour 31 minutes later, that game was declared a rainout.</p>
        <p>The Mets' left-hander tried it again today at Wrigley Field, where a muggy Chicago morning gave way to afternoon showers just before Hampton faced the Cubs in the bottom of the first.

        <p>Four starts ago, Mike Hampton pitched a game that was delayed 211 minutes by rain. Last Sunday night, he had just struck out Paul O'Neill in the third inning when the heavens opened over Yankee Stadium, and 1 hour 31 minutes later, that game was declared a rainout.</p>
        <p>The Mets' left-hander tried it again today at Wrigley Field, where a muggy Chicago morning gave way to afternoon showers just before Hampton faced the Cubs in the bottom of the first. He waited 35 minutes, then pitched one inning. The Mets batted, it rained again, and Hampton did not return when play resumed nearly two hours later.</p>
        <p>''I am officially the Rain Man,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Hampton's exit led to a procession of mostly ineffective Mets relievers. But the Cubs bullpen was worse, and that made the difference as the Mets won, 10-8, before a crowd that started with 38,625 fans and ended without anybody in the rooftop bleachers above Waveland Avenue. Three rain delays totaling 3 hours 23 minutes, plus 3:40 of baseball, caused that.</p>
        <p>''After the third rain delay, it took on the feeling of a B game in spring training,'' said Mike Piazza, who had a homer and three runs batted in. ''It just kind of lost it -- absolutely no rhythm whatsoever to the game.''</p>
        <p>The Cubs had three leads -- getting one lead apiece off Hampton, Pat Mahomes and Glendon Rusch -- and each time the Mets tied the score. The Mets went ahead with a four-run sixth in which they had four doubles off two Chicago relievers.</p>
        <p>Kurt Abbott had the double that put the Mets ahead for good.</p>
        <p>The Mets smacked four homers, including two by Benny Agbayani, who put one well up the center-field backdrop and the other onto Waveland Avenue beyond left field.</p>
        <p>''I haven't hit the ball like that in a long time,'' Agbayani said.</p>
        <p>Agbayani's first homer gave the Mets a 9-4 lead in the seventh, but the Cubs scored four runs off Turk Wendell in the bottom of the inning to pull within one. Two hits and a walk off Dennis Cook loaded the bases, and Manager Bobby Valentine called on John Franco as his fifth reliever of the day. That brought an end to the bullpen follies. Franco did his job, getting an inning-ending grounder with Sammy Sosa on deck to preserve a one-run lead. Armando Benitez followed with one and one-third scoreless innings for his 16th save.</p>
        <p>Rusch (4-4) worked the fourth and fifth innings -- after the third rain delay -- and was the winning pitcher. The left-hander needed the work; he was scheduled to have eight days between his last start and his next, on Saturday in Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>Hampton's inning was shaky; he allowed three singles and a walk to the first four hitters, bringing in one run. Hampton seemed uncomfortable, squatting behind the mound, stretching his legs. Something was wrong: he had a strained groin.</p>
        <p>Hampton said he has had groin problems before and that he would have kept pitching if not for the rain delay. He does not expect to miss Sunday's start, and he said the injury was ''no big deal.''</p>
        <p>A bigger deal to Hampton, who threw his helmet after popping out in the second inning, was that he lost more chances to hit. In his last five games, Hampton had seven hits in 13 at-bats to raise his average to .355.</p>
        <p>''I'm ticked off because I'm losing at-bats,'' Hampton said. ''I wanted to keep my hitting streak alive.''</p>
        <p>Hampton will start in Milwaukee on Sunday, bumping Rick Reed's start to Tuesday in the opener of a homestand that will feature 13 games in 13 days. Weather permitting, of course.</p>
        <p>''Until every team in baseball gets a dome,'' Hampton said, ''we'll just have to put up with it.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>If the Mets aggressively pursue a slugging outfielder before the trading deadline, it is more likely to be the Cubs' SAMMY SOSA than Detroit's JUAN GONZALEZ. The Mets prefer Sosa because he cannot become a free agent until after the 2001 season, and they believe he would be more likely to sign a contract extension than would Gonzalez, who seems headed for free agency this winter after spurning the Tigers' overtures at a new contract. The Mets also see Sosa as the better fielder.</p>
        <p>Second baseman EDGARDO ALFONZO was unavailable for the Mets because of a stiff back, and he did not take batting practice. Manager BOBBY VALENTINE was not sure Alfonzo would be ready by tomorrow, saying, ''We hope it loosens up.''</p>
        <p>Not wanting to waste a position player as a pinch-hitter so early in the game, Cubs Manager DON BAYLOR used pitcher KERRY WOOD to bat for pitcher SCOTT DOWNS in the second inning. Downs did not return after the first rain delay, and Wood was hitting .231 before PAT MAHOMES struck him out.</p>
        <p>Left fielder JASON TYNER of the Mets had a minor bone bruise on his right arm, so BENNY AGBAYANI made his first start in June. Agbayani has been discouraged about his lack of playing time, and he declined to answer when asked if he would rather be a reserve on a winning team or a starter somewhere else. ''I think Benny's a good player and we have to work him in,'' Valentine said.</p>
