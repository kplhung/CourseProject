        <p>Prosecutors have charged dozens of people with using stock manipulation, fraud and violence to steal from thousands of investors nationwide in a scheme that federal authorities are calling one of organized crime's most aggressive forays into the stock market.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said their investigation swept up one high-ranking member and several lower-level members of New York's organized-crime families, as well as brokers, stock promoters and a retired police officer who served as treasurer of the union that represents New York City detectives.</p>

        <p>Prosecutors have charged dozens of people with using stock manipulation, fraud and violence to steal from thousands of investors nationwide in a scheme that federal authorities are calling one of organized crime's most aggressive forays into the stock market.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said their investigation swept up one high-ranking member and several lower-level members of New York's organized-crime families, as well as brokers, stock promoters and a retired police officer who served as treasurer of the union that represents New York City detectives.</p>
        <p>At the center of the investigation is a Manhattan investment firm, DMN Capital Investments, which prosecutors said was infiltrated by mob associates.</p>
        <p>Federal agents charged that the defendants used a range of schemes to defraud investors, from running traditional high-pressure boiler-rooms sales operations to bribing brokers and creating phony stock trades. Such tactics would artificially inflate the price of stocks, which could then be sold at an illicit profit.</p>
