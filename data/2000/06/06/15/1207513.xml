        <p>They weighed 75 pounds when they first met. Shane Mosley was 12 years old, Oscar De La Hoya was 11 and, according to Mosley, the decision was never in doubt.</p>
        <p>''I hit him anytime I wanted to with the jab,'' Mosley recalled during an interview in his downtown hotel suite. ''I beat him, but that's about it.''</p>
        <p>As amateurs, they boxed about 60 rounds against each other, developing a rivalry and mutual respect that will culminate Saturday night, when Mosley and De La Hoya fight for the World Boxing Council welterweight championship at the Staples Center.</p>
        <p>Befitting De La Hoya's draw at the box office, promoters for Top Rank are predicting that pay-per-view sales will be the largest in history for a nonheavyweight fight. For De La Hoya, it is a chance to polish his golden-boy image and finally put his haunting Sept. 18 loss to Felix Trinidad behind him.</p>
        <p>For Mosley, it is simply an opportunity to ascend to stardom.</p>
        <p>''It's time for a new champion,'' Mosley said. ''People need to see just how Sugar Shane executes.''</p>
        <p>Mosley (34-0, 32 knockouts) can become the sixth fighter to win both the lightweight and welterweight titles. He would join a group that includes De La Hoya (32-1, 26 knockouts), Roberto Duran, Pernell Whitaker, Henry Armstrong and Barney Ross.</p>
        <p>As a 135-pound lightweight, Mosley defended his title eight times, winning each by knockout. He vacated the championship last year and made the leap to the 147-pound welterweight division. After knockouts of Wilfredo Rivera and Willie Wise, Mosley moved into position for a reunion with De La Hoya.</p>
        <p>''Fighting De La Hoya gives me a comfort level because we know each other so well,'' Mosley said. ''A lot of other fighters have gotten in the ring with him and get hit a couple of times and they go, 'Oh, wow,' and they start doubting themselves. With me, I know what to expect. I know what I'm up against.''</p>
        <p>Mosley has been staggered, but never knocked to the canvas in his career.</p>
        <p>Similar to their amateur days, he believes, his jabs are still quicker and stronger than De La Hoya's. ''I can cover over the top of his jab with mine,'' Mosley said.</p>
        <p>De La Hoya politely disagreed.</p>
        <p>''If he's seen everything, he hasn't felt it,'' De La Hoya said. ''He's had 34 fights, but he doesn't have that kind of experience to know how it feels to be hit by someone who can punch as hard as me. I don't know how he's going to react, but it's an issue with him.''</p>
        <p>Mosley and De La Hoya last met in the ring during sparring sessions as they both prepared for the 1992 Olympics, where De La Hoya won the gold medal at 132 pounds.</p>
        <p>''It was a jab contest between me and him,'' Mosley said. ''I landed a lot of jabs and overhand rights. Oscar did what he does best, throw a lot of combinations and left hooks.''</p>
        <p>Their comments are as divergent as their pro careers. After his gold medal performance at Barcelona, Spain, De La Hoya became a four-time champion and popular figure among fans.</p>
        <p>Mosley quickly disappeared into the lightweight ranks. As an Olympic team member and three-time national amateur champion, his credentials were never questioned. Against inferior lightweights, though, the experts found Mosley tougher to rank than De La Hoya.</p>
        <p>''I was the No. 1 guy for a long time,'' Mosley said. ''I just never got the recognition and credit I deserved. I was No. 1 in Golden Gloves, I was No. 1 at nationals. You can go down the list. Oscar was chasing me.''</p>
        <p>PUNCH LINES</p>
        <p>OSCAR DE LA HOYA continued his stand against sanctioning fees, so his promoter, BOB ARUM, will pay the World Boxing Council for Saturday night's title fight. Arum would not disclose the amount, which was reportedly discounted by the W.B.C. president, JOSE SULAIMAN. The standard rate is 3 percent, which would have meant a $240,000 deduction from De La Hoya's $8 million purse.</p>
        <p>''I'm doing this for the fighters,'' said De La Hoya, who hopes his example will lead to negotiations for lower fees or perhaps a cap.</p>
