        <p>Re ''U.S. Ambassador to U.N. Calls for Changes in Peacekeeping'' (news article, June 14):</p>
        <p>Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke is correct that the United Nations must transform its peacekeeping department to avoid repeated humiliations in future operations. But what is needed to prevent future debacles like the one that occurred in Sierra Leone and, more important, to maintain international peace and security effectively is not simply an enhanced military-style operation but a standing force to respond immediately to whatever crises the Security Council directs.</p>
        <p>It would be composed entirely of professional soldiers, enlisted directly and commissioned by the secretary general, with its own equipment, transportation and personnel.</p>
        <p>Such an independent force would alleviate the concerns of a would-be troop provider that views a particular conflict as irrelevant to its own national security, as well as help reduce the United States' role as world policeman, which is so detrimental to our own military readiness.</p>
