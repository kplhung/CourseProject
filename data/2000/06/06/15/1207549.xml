        <p>Lance Armstrong, who last summer capped an amazing recovery from cancer by winning the Tour de France, the world's most prestigious and difficult bicycle race, is a bit concerned about his physical condition. He says he feels so sharp that he may be ready too soon for this year's tour, from July 1 to 23.</p>
        <p>''All my training and racing this year has been geared to the tour,'' Armstrong said last night in a telephone interview from his spring and summer home in Nice, France. ''I'm satisfied with what I've done. In fact, maybe I'm a little ahead of schedule.</p>
        <p>''When you're in such good condition, you can't use it in training or races to show off your strength. You can't constantly go deep and try to be extraordinary all the time or you'll break down your form.''</p>
        <p>Last weekend, Armstrong, 28, and his United States Postal Service team completed the Tour Dauphine Libere, eight days through the French Alps with considerable climbing. His teammate Tyler Hamilton won. Armstrong finished third.</p>
        <p>''I did the same race last year,'' Armstrong said, ''and didn't feel nearly as good as I did this year. So this told me that I'm either stronger than I was last year or I'm too far ahead of schedule now. I don't know. I have to be careful not to be ready too quick.''</p>
        <p>That Armstrong is even riding is remarkable. Less than three years ago, testicular cancer that had spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain was diagnosed; doctors gave him less than a 50-50 chance to recover. He not only recovered, but also rode better than ever. He said his health is fine now, and the slight concussion he sustained a month ago in a training crash had done nothing except persuade him to wear his helmet whenever he rides.</p>
        <p>Last winter, back home in Austin, Tex., he spent much of his time with his foundation spreading awareness of cancer. With Sally Jenkins, he also wrote an autobiography, ''It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life'' (Putnam). It was sixth among nonfiction books on last Sunday's New York Times best-seller list.</p>
        <p>Now comes the defense of his Tour de France title, although his human-interest drama has been overshadowed by the drug problems that have haunted this race in recent years. Cycling officials are suspending riders for two weeks if their red blood cell count exceeds 50 percent, saying it may indicate the use of EPO, a potentially life-threatening drug.</p>
        <p>''I think we need a test,'' Armstrong said, ''but it needs to be solid and fair. I hate to think we could have false positives and see our sport thrown back into all that baloney again. There's not nearly as much of that stuff used as people are led to believe. From all my experience on all the teams I've been on, this is overblown.</p>
        <p>''Besides, the percentage of red blood cells fluctuates drastically according to the effort you put in. Mine is generally 43 or 44 percent, but if I train for three or four weeks at altitude it could go up to 50 percent. So there's a problem there.''</p>
        <p>Armstrong's support staff is in place. At his three-bedroom home in Nice, a mile uphill from the Mediterranean, he has his wife, Kristin, and their 8-month-old son, Luke, who has started to crawl. He says nothing is bothering him, including the pressure on a defending champion.</p>
        <p>Does he expect to win the tour?</p>
        <p>''I'll be disappointed if I don't,'' he said, ''but I don't know if that means I expect to win. I certainly expect to be a factor. In the tour, the strongest man almost always wins, and I felt I was the strongest last year.</p>
        <p>''It was a big deal when I won because of my comeback from sickness. This year won't be the same story, but it's tough to repeat as a champion. I'm a marked man. But I'm still proud that a cancer survivor is in a position to try to repeat in the hardest event in the world.''</p>
        <p>And if he doesn't win?</p>
        <p>''It would mean somebody else was better,'' he said. ''I'd go home and pick up my baby and forget about it.''</p>
