        <p>The Justice Department filed a brief today with a federal appeals court intended to persuade the judges not to begin work on the Microsoft case until the Supreme Court decides whether to take it.</p>
        <p>The department and 19 state attorneys general, as well as the trial judge, want to move Microsoft's appeal directly to the Supreme Court. Microsoft, on the other hand, wants the appeal heard first by the lower court, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. And in a lightning-fast legal maneuver Tuesday afternoon, the company filed a part of its appeal with that court, which eagerly accepted it.</p>
        <p>Today the Justice Department asked the Court of Appeals, which has been sympathetic to Microsoft's legal arguments in the past, to ''defer all consideration'' of the company's appeal.</p>
        <p>''It makes little sense for the court to rush'' into considering Microsoft's request ''before ascertaining whether it will have jurisdiction over the case,'' the department's brief said.</p>
        <p>It cited two reasons. For one, the brief noted, the government has asked Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to certify the case for the direct review by the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>''Certification would immediately divest this court of jurisdiction over the appeal,'' the brief said. ''and jurisdiction would be restored only if the Supreme Court chooses at some future time to cede the case back to this court and restore its jurisdiction.''</p>
        <p>In a statement issued today, Microsoft said: ''Microsoft does not believe that the government should try to evade the Court of Appeals, but we are confident of our appeal regardless of which court hears the case.''</p>
        <p>The government brief adds that Judge Jackson has not yet ruled on Microsoft's request that the remedy order he imposed last week be stayed pending appeal. Nonetheless, Microsoft filed its stay request with the Court of Appeals on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        <p>''Microsoft failed to comply with the requirement'' in federal rules ''that it first give the district court a chance to rule on its stay motion,'' the government said.</p>
        <p>Microsoft argues that it waited almost a week for Judge Jackson to rule on the stay request, even though the first part of his sanctions are to take effect in less than 90 days.</p>
        <p>But the Justice Department brief says Judge Jackson ''would likely have already ruled but for Microsoft's procedural maneuvering.''</p>
        <p>In announcing his decision on remedies last week, Judge Jackson stayed his order breaking up Microsoft, but not the additional restrictions he imposed on the company. In the legal maneuvering on Tuesday, Microsoft filed its stay request with the Court of Appeals, while the Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general filed a request with the lower court to move the appeal directly to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The Court of Appeals would like to take the case, the highest-profile legal case in the nation today. The court issued an extraordinary order Tuesday advising Microsoft that the judges had, on their own, decided that the full appeals court, minus three judges who recused themselves because of apparent conflicts of interest, would hear the case. In all but the rarest of cases, a three-judge panel hears an appeal before it is given an opportunity to be heard by the full court.</p>
        <p>The Court of Appeals had the order ready even before Microsoft presented its brief. When a Microsoft lawyer submitted the brief Tuesday, a court clerk stopped him and then handed him the court order, which had already been entered.</p>
        <p>''The order issued yesterday by the Court of Appeals clearly shows that the court is prepared to move expeditiously, which is in the best interests of all parties,'' Microsoft said today.</p>
        <p>While asserting that it wants the case to move expeditiously, Microsoft asked Judge Jackson this morning to give the company until Monday to reply to the government's expedited appeal request. After that, the Justice Department has the right to respond. So it seems unlikely that Judge Jackson will certify the case for consideration by the Supreme Court before the middle of next week.</p>
