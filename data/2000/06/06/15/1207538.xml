        <p>Signaling a new, aggressive approach to her Senate campaign, Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday accused her opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, of voting in Congress ''against the interests of women, children and families.''</p>
        <p>She invoked his positions on gun control, abortion and education financing to assert that Mr. Lazio is not the moderate figure he claims to be -- a claim that even Mrs. Clinton's aides acknowledge is gaining some currency with voters.</p>
        <p>The first lady assailed Mr. Lazio repeatedly during a 30-minute address to female  supporters in Manhattan. She variously portrayed Mr. Lazio as a captive to the gun lobby, a Republican partisan and a supporter of abortion rights only when it came to ''rich women'' who did not need government assistance to pay for the procedure.</p>
        <p>''On issue after issue, my opponent has been a follower, not a leader,'' Mrs. Clinton  declared at a fund-raising breakfast at the Waldorf-Astoria. ''He voted to shut down the government. He voted for a trillion-dollar budget that would have slashed so many services that we need here in New York. He would squander the surplus and, I believe, endanger the economy. And yet he says he agrees with me on issues.''</p>
        <p>''Time and time again, my opponent has voted against the interests of New York's women, children and families,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's speech yesterday morning underscored a shift in strategy over the last several days by a candidate who has, with the loss of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as an opponent, seemed unsure how to proceed in an unexpectedly tight race with his replacement, a little-known Republican representative from Suffolk County. In taking on Mr. Lazio so directly -- the speech sounded like the kind of attack candidates save for the final weeks of a campaign -- Mrs. Clinton was trying to shape New Yorkers' perception of her new opponent before he can.</p>
        <p>A New York Times/CBS News Poll released on Monday found the candidates in a dead heat, even though most New Yorkers polled said they did not know enough about Mr. Lazio to venture an opinion on his fitness for office.</p>
        <p>''Maybe his folks think that if he remains a blank slate, he wins; but no one remains a blank slate,'' one of Mrs. Clinton's advisers said, adding that it was ''time to run the fingernails across the blank slate.''</p>
        <p>This aggressive stance was notable for a first lady who has been, with a few exceptions, decorous in most of her campaign appearances, to the continuing frustration of Democrats who worry that her campaign is overly placid.</p>
        <p>But for Mrs. Clinton, who is disliked by many voters, the strategy risks alienating potential supporters. She already was viewed unfavorably by 31 percent of respondents in the Times/CBS poll, taken from June 4 to June 10, an uncomfortably high number that may explain why Mr. Lazio is doing so well.</p>
        <p>And by noon yesterday, Mr. Lazio moved to encourage this sentiment about Mrs. Clinton, releasing a statement asserting that the first lady was engaging in ''mudslinging'' and distorting what he described as his ''mainstream record.''</p>
        <p>''I was deeply disappointed today to see Mrs. Clinton launch a campaign that seems to be made up of little more than attacks designed to fool New Yorkers about my record,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''While I understand the first lady's frustration with her campaign's inability to connect with New Yorkers, I believe she would better serve herself by addressing the issues rather than throwing mud.</p>
        <p>''I am sad to say that all too often it appears that the first casualty in a Clinton campaign is the truth,'' he declared.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton is seeking to do what is known in politics as ''defining'' an opponent, though in practice, several politicians noted yesterday, the word ''destroying'' might be more apt. In this case, Mrs. Clinton's advisers have cited polls that suggest that voters, if they have a view of Mr. Lazio at all, consider him moderate rather than conservative; in the Times/CBS poll, 34 percent of respondents described him as moderate, and 28 percent called him conservative. (The poll of 1,384 voters across New York was taken from June 4 to June 10 and had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio is viewed in Congress as having an ideologically nuanced record; he is conservative on some issues and moderate on others. Mrs. Clinton pointed to votes Mr. Lazio had cast to try to place him on the conservative side of the spectrum.</p>
        <p>For example, she noted that he had joined Republicans in voting against legislation to provide funding to allow public schools to hire 100,000 more teachers. Instead, Mr. Lazio supported Republican legislation that would have given school districts more flexibility in deciding how to spend federal money for education.</p>
        <p>She also noted that Mr. Lazio had opposed legislation to give patients the right to sue health maintenance organizations, and a Democratic bill to provide Medicare coverage for prescription drugs. And she assailed him again for opposing proposals to require the registration of new handguns and the licensing of gun owners.</p>
        <p>''Apparently, he is more willing to  go along with the Republican leadership and the N.R.A. than the children and families of New York,'' she said, referring to the National Rifle Association.</p>
        <p>Most of all, with an eye to her female audience, Mrs. Clinton stressed Mr. Lazio's views on abortion. She noted that the next Senate is likely to vote on nominees to the Supreme Court, and asserted that Mr. Lazio could not be counted on to oppose justices who would support curbing abortions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio says he supports keeping abortion legal but, unlike Mrs. Clinton, opposes public financing of abortion and supports a ban on the procedure that abortion foes refer to as ''partial birth abortion.''</p>
        <p>''I know that my opponent calls himself pro-choice, but if you look at his record, he's apparently pro-choice for rich women,'' Mrs. Clinton said.</p>
