        <p>The Kremlin said today that it has identified remains found in Chechnya this spring as those of Maj. Gen. Gennadi Shpigun, the federal envoy whose kidnapping helped touch off Russia's latest war against the region's secessionist rebels.</p>
        <p>General Shpigun, an Interior Ministry liaison to Chechen officials, was abducted in March 1999 as his plane was leaving the airport in Grozny, Chechnya's capital. According to news reports, the guerrillas who held him had demanded as much as $15 million in ransom before lowering their price to $3 million late last year.</p>
        <p>The general's remains were found this past March 29, a year later, near the southern Chechnya village of Itum-Kale. The circumstances of his death were not clear, but by one report he had escaped captivity only to freeze in the mountains separating Chechnya from Georgia.</p>
        <p>General Shpigun was a top official in the government's Interior Ministry forces, which bore the brunt of Russian peacekeeping efforts near Chechnya before full-scale war broke out last August.</p>
        <p>Russian troops suffered a decisive loss in the war against the rebels in 1996, and in the aftermath, the Kremlin focused largely on finding a political solution to the secession movement. But according to Sergei V. Stepashin, the former Russian prime minister who was Interior Minister in early 1999, General Shpigun's abduction changed that.</p>
        <p>Witnesses said General Shpigun had completed work in Grozny on March 5, 1999, and his Moscow-bound plane was taxing down the runway of the city's airport when guerrillas burst from the luggage hold and seized him.</p>
        <p>In an interview in January, Mr. Stepashin said the kidnapping helped convince senior officials that a political solution to the Chechen situation was unlikely and that force would be needed to contain the guerrillas.</p>
        <p>That month, he said, strategists drew up plans to seal Chechnya's borders with surrounding provinces, an action that Mr. Stepashin's successor as prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin, announced later that summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin later went well beyond Mr. Stepashin's limited proposals, starting a full-scale war against the rebels after they broke out of Chechnya last August and invaded an adjacent Russian province, Dagestan.</p>
        <p>Russian leaders first threatened to sever financial and political ties with Chechen leaders if General Shpigun was not quickly released, and then pledged to retaliate against the Russian relatives of Chechen rebels. But eventually, the two sides settled into negotiations over his release, which continued through last winter. A week before General Shpigun's body was found, Russian military officials insisted he was still alive.</p>
        <p>Today, the nation's deputy interior minister, Col. Gen. Valery Fyodorov, said genetic tests had provided proof that the remains were the general's.</p>
