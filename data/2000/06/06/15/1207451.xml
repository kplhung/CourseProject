        <p>THE UNQUIET NIGHT  By Patricia Carlon  Soho Press. Hardcover. 192 pages. $22.</p>
        <p>THE PRICE OF AN ORPHAN  By Patricia Carlon  Soho Press. Paperback. 192 pages. $12.</p>
        <p>By the side of a lake, a dangerous young man is in the throes of remorse, for he has just strangled his date. He rolls her body into the water and is about to flee when he spies pigtailed little Ann Penghill and her aunt Rachel. They spot him, too, and would be able to identify him should the police ever ask questions. The assailant soon realizes that he must track down and silence Ann and Rachel, and ''The Unquiet Night,'' a tight, nerve-racking exercise in coolly Hitchcockian suspense plotting, is set in motion.</p>
        <p>The villain, Mart Deeford, has no idea who the Penghills are. But he spends the long night of the title in making deductions that would appeal to Norman Bates, another tricky-tempered fellow with a methodical modus operandi and certain unresolved feelings about women. So Mart calls the local schoolteacher to inquire innocently about which schoolgirls wear pigtails. He stakes out a house -- the wrong one, as it happens -- and gets ready to ambush his prey. He lures a babysitter away from her charge with a lie about an injured pet. Meanwhile, Rachel has a falling-out with her boyfriend, leaves Ann and retreats to the otherwise deserted stalker's paradise of a building that she calls home.</p>

        <p>The villain, Mart Deeford, has no idea who the Penghills are. But he spends the long night of the title in making deductions that would appeal to Norman Bates, another tricky-tempered fellow with a methodical modus operandi and certain unresolved feelings about women.

He lures a babysitter away from her charge with a lie about an injured pet. Meanwhile, Rachel has a falling-out with her boyfriend, leaves Ann and retreats to the otherwise deserted stalker's paradise of a building that she calls home.</p>
        <p>Patricia Carlon, about whom more in a moment, has the makings here of a typically violence-spattered story of voyeurism, in which a lone creep terrorizes an entire town in the course of a single evening. But the author's specialties as a crime writer are pure plot mechanics, not action or sadism, so this happens to be a formidably suspenseful thriller in which no one need necessarily die. Compared with such popular crime fiction as Robert Crais's current ''Demolition Angel'' -- a movie-on-paper that begins with a deadly fireball, suffers a bad case of ''Silence of the Lambs'' envy, treats chain-smoking as a character trait and has a striving mad-bomber villain whose stated goal is making it onto the F.B.I.'s 10 Most Wanted -- her rigorous, bare-bones brand of mayhem seems positively quaint.</p>
        <p>It should. ''The Unquiet Night'' dates back to 1965 and is only now being published in the United States, as the sixth in an under-the-radar series of nail-biters from this Australian author. Born in Wagga Wagga and 73 this year, Ms. Carlon writes in a blunt, efficient manner that pays scant attention to such niceties as style or complex motivation, but leaves no question about the tension level of the main event. Puzzles are her forte, and she structures them devilishly well -- as when Rachel Penghill, by now imprisoned and left to die, realizes that the trap she is trying to dig her way out of is next door to a Chinese restaurant serving meals she likes: ''She dwelt on them, forcing herself to concentrate, as she counted and swung and tapped and banged, on every aspect that must go into the preparation and cooking of her favorite dishes, while outside, the wind was picking up again, gently turning and twisting at the white notice on the cafe door, on which was lettered ''Closed Mondays.''</p>
        <p>No need to wonder on which day of the week this takes place.</p>
        <p>The same taste for startling visual frissons marks the opening of ''The Price of an Orphan,'' another crafty, teasing mystery from an author whose way with titles is obviously the least of her talents. Dating from 1964, and now published here in paperback after last year's hardcover edition, it too begins with an incriminating scene witnessed by a 9-year-old. As little Johnnie looks on, unseen, a floozy in a red dress arrives in a remote outback setting for a meeting with a person wearing gabardine trousers and a felt hat. Johnnie is too far away to guess the gender of this person, and Ms. Carlon is far too coy for personal pronouns.  But the floozy is murdered, her car and body hidden in a cave, and the telltale license plates are hidden separately to make identification impossible. Except for Johnnie, who knows exactly where they are.</p>
        <p>The evil trick this time is that Johnnie is a well-known handful for his step-parents, Kay and Stuart Heath, and that he is a notorious liar. When he tells a heavily embellished story about the killing, nobody believes him -- nobody except the wearer of the sexually ambiguous hat and trousers, who is part of the book's small cast of characters and waits patiently for the chance to whisk Johnnie away on a camping trip. There is no great likelihood that he will return from such an outing.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carlon, capable of many discreet kinks, keeps the reader guessing not only about the killer's gender, but about just how elaborate a game she herself is playing. With the appearance of a suspicious character named Miss Mings, for instance, comes reason to wonder whether her gruff, masculine manner is a red herring or a clue. Suffice it to say that the question of the killer's identity is settled early, and that most of the subsequent suspense is about how Johnnie will escape that killer's clutches. The single best moment in a long trail of twists and surprises occurs when the killer pulls up to a gas station and is casually told that the car -- in which Johnnie is being held prisoner -- has license plates that don't match.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carlon's mysteries are dated by certain cultural attitudes, like Rachel Penghill's desperation over being an old maid, and by the willingness of everyone in ''The Price of an Orphan'' to suggest that Johnnie would benefit from a good whacking. Unfortunate racist condescension about its aborigine characters also turns up in the latter book. But the forthright maze-building skills of this tart, hard-boiled author remain superlative, especially in light of the fact that she has spent much of her career writing pseudonymous romance novels. Now those must be scary indeed.</p>
