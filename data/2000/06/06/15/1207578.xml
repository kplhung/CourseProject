        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Dr. Elena Citkowitz described in a letter on June 8 (Incoming, ''Surge Protection Subtleties'') how an electrical storm destroyed her modem because there was no surge protector on the telephone line. Phone-line surge protectors are, of course, readily available, but a better solution is an I.P.S. (Uninterruptible Power Source). Models like the CyberPower 320SL and the APC 500 protect against surges through phone and electrical lines with a battery backup that will keep your computer and monitor running for the few minutes needed to shut down your whole system automatically, even if you're not at the keyboard when lightning strikes. Street prices for these home-office units are less than $100. For me, that's a one-time insurance premium equal to 5 percent of the cost of my system -- and it's almost nothing compared to the value of the protected data.</p>
