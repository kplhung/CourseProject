        <p>When Mehmet Ali Agca, the man who shot Pope John Paul II in 1981, stepped off a plane at the Istanbul airport this morning, he was carrying some of Turkey's darkest secrets with him.</p>
        <p>Whether he will tell what he knows, however, is highly uncertain. In his 19 years in an Italian prison, he never gave a definitive account of why he shot the pope or who helped plan the attack. Many Turks say they believe that he will be no more forthcoming now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Agca, who had been serving a life term, was released on Tuesday and extradited to Turkey. President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi of Italy said he had ordered the release at the urging of the pope, who had visited Mr. Agca in prison and forgiven him.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Agca's predawn arrival,  an armored convoy took him to the high-security Kartal prison, home to several infamous criminals.</p>
        <p>In the 70's, Mr. Agca (pronounced AH-jah) was a part of a network of neofascist gunmen who believed that it was their mission to cleanse Turkey of leftist influence. Considerable evidence has emerged to suggest that the network was closely tied to far-right politicians, police commanders and intelligence officers.</p>
        <p>Soon after a liberal newspaper editor, Abdi Ipekci, was murdered near his house in Istanbul in 1979, Mr. Agca was arrested and charged with the crime. But while awaiting trial, he escaped from prison. He was convicted of the murder in absentia and sentenced to die, a sentence later commuted to 10 years in prison.</p>
        <p>Mr. Agca, who is now 43 and gray haired, has been just as silent about Mr. Ipekci's murder as he was about the attack on the pope.</p>
        <p>''His honest testimony would be an earthquake in Turkey,'' said Sami Kohen, a newspaper columnist who was one of Mr. Ipekci's closest friends and colleagues. ''He must know a great deal about the connection of the extreme right wing to intelligence services, police and other elements of what we call 'deep state.' I hope the authorities and interrogators will be able to get him to say what is in his mind.''</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, a former journalist who had worked closely with Mr. Ipekci, thanked Italy for sending the killer back. ''Italy's handing the terrorist Agca over to Turkish justice is a very important event that could raise the curtain of secrecy from Ipekci's murder and illuminate some dark pages in our recent history,'' Mr. Ecevit said.</p>
        <p>In recent years, scandals have revealed a web of connections that bound Turkish gangsters, drug smugglers and far-right gunmen to powerful figures in the state. The officials acted in part because they felt a duty to crush what they perceived as Communist subversion and, later, Kurdish nationalism.</p>
        <p>Turks saw the first evidence of the connections in 1996, when a top police commander and a convicted heroin smuggler known for far-right views were killed in a car crash. Questions about what they were doing together led to a parliamentary investigation and a series of stunning disclosures. Although the scandal profoundly shook Turkey, investigators later complained that the military and other security agencies had blocked their work and did not let them follow many leads.</p>
        <p>This year, the police raided hideouts used by a fanatic religious group, Hizbullah, and under floorboards and in adjacent gardens they found the remains of dozens of people who had been tortured to death. News commentators and politicians have contended that Hizbullah worked closely with security agents in southeastern Turkey, where hundreds of suspected Kurdish nationalists have disappeared or been murdered since the civil war intensified there in the early 90's.</p>
        <p>Many of the killers who were active in recent decades maintained ties to a far-right political party, Nationalist Action, often known by its initials, M.H.P. That party is now part of the governing coalition, and its leader, Devlet Bahceli, is deputy prime minister. Mr. Bahceli says the party has renounced violence. But some members still sympathize with gunmen who they believe killed in the cause of patriotism.</p>
        <p>''I don't think Agca is going to tell secrets, because he fears for his life,'' said Mehmet Ali Birand, a Turkish journalist who interviewed Mr. Agca three times in prison. ''Don't forget that he was helped out of prison after he said that during his trial he was going to tell what he knew. That got some people frightened, and they helped him escape.</p>
        <p>''Now he has nine and a half years to serve in prison. He's probably thinking that if he serves two or three years, he'll be able to escape the rest through some kind of pardon or amnesty. He feels that there are people in the M.H.P. who are keen on protecting their old allies. I doubt he will try to rock the boat unless he sits in jail for five or six years and doesn't see any other way out.''</p>
