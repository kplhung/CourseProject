        <p>Because Al Gore stands an even chance of becoming our next president, I thought it would be a good idea to nail down his position on a sleeper issue in this campaign: the abuse of computer technology to invade personal privacy.</p>
        <p>The opportunity arose to put the privacy question to the vice president this week at an on-the-record session with Times editors in New York.</p>
        <p>To show that entrapment with a trick question on a complex issue was not my intent, I prefaced my query with a brief explanation of the two key words used by both sides in the controversy.</p>
        <p>The word choice is used by banks, hospitals and Internet companies to conceal their intrusions into the personal lives of their customers. They offer us a ''choice'' to tell them not to share our most intimate secrets with others -- but the burden of that decision is on the customer, who can be manipulated by a bribe of a gift or a threat of refusal of business. The intruders know that most people can't be bothered to choose to ''opt out'' -- to take the initiative to defend themselves.</p>
        <p>The word consent is used by those opposed to the placement of ''cookies'' (spying bugs to track your every online movement) in your computer. We want to place the burden of seeking your express, informed consent on the marketers; this means you must first be made aware of who will get what information about you,  and be told explicitly whether it will be sold or given to some other company or division for a different purpose. Only if you affirmatively ''opt in'' -- give your permission -- can they then track your tastes and habits.</p>
        <p>The difference is day and night. Choice is the misleading word used to cover a phony pass at a privacy policy, which retailers, insurers and banks are now touting, while consent is your valuable power to say ''yes'' that they are desperate to deny customers. In the sellout engineered last year by the Clinton treasury secretary, Larry Summers, and the G.O.P. Senate Banking chairman, Phil Gramm, the banking lobby won; your consent is not required.</p>
        <p>So, Mr. vice president, how come you spoke of providing choice in your speech about privacy? Would you support legislation requiring companies to first obtain the consumer's consent?</p>
        <p>''Along with 270 million other Americans,'' he replied, ''I use words more carelessly than Bill Safire. And in choosing the word 'choose,' I did not inform myself of the deeper, more subtle meanings -- which I now see clearly.''</p>
        <p>Then Gore got serious: ''I don't think an unfair burden should be placed on the users of the Internet to affirmatively go out and protect their own privacy.'' He added: ''I think there should be procedures commonly accepted which protect them more or less automatically unless they [the Internet users] take affirmative steps to surrender their privacy.''</p>
        <p>That spells consent, but I pressed him on legislation to protect financial privacy, where his administration has been weak.</p>
        <p>''I can tell you what the ideas are that I believe in,'' he said. ''I think that we should have absolute protection of financial privacy as well as medical privacy. I do not think that your bank account and the history of what checks you write, and to whom, ought to be marketable.''</p>
        <p>Gore warmed to the subject: ''I think that people ought to have a right to expect that will remain private unless they affirmatively give up that right for whatever reason. And I don't think the current law goes far enough in protecting them.  Does that answer your question?''</p>
        <p>Sure does. He also touched my button with ''It should be illegal to trade in Social Security numbers. That's the single key fact that is most useful in compiling dossiers.''</p>
        <p>At that very moment, Senator John McCain was holding Commerce Committee hearings to expose ''online profiling,'' the turning of Net users into ripe selling targets. Industry snoops are suddenly promising self-policing -- anything to avoid asking consent.</p>
        <p>Gore's stand on the right to privacy is forceful. Next is for one of us to pin down George W. Bush.</p>
