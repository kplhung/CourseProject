        <p>Honor Bound</p>
        <p>The composer Steve Reich has been named the winner of the $50,000 William Schuman Award of the Columbia University School of the Arts. Mr. Reich, born in New York in 1936, is a pioneer of Minimalism whose music has been performed by major orchestras around the world.

        <p>Harvest of Art</p>
        <p>In Branchville, Conn., stands the farm that was the home and workplace of the American Impressionist Julian Alden Weir (1852-1919). Designated a National Historic Site in 1990, Weir's retreat attracted turn-of-the-last-century artists like Childe Hassam, John Henry Twachtman, Albert Pinkham Ryder and Sargent. Beginning on Saturday, more than 70 paintings by Weir and his visitors, from public and private collections, will be exhibited at the Bruce Museum of Arts and Science in Greenwich, Conn. ''A Connecticut Place: Weir Farm, An American Painter's Rural Retreat'' continues through Sept. 17.</p>
        <p>Poetry and Music</p>
        <p>Shakespeare's Forest of Arden will take the form of a Lower East Side parking lot at 8 p.m. tomorrow when the figurative curtain goes up on ''As You Like It.'' The site, where the show will play another preview on Saturday night before adopting a Wednesday through Saturday schedule starting next week, is the Municipal Parking Lot between Delancey and Broome Streets and across from 85 Ludlow Street. The production is the Sixth Annual Shakespeare in the Park(ing) Lot presentation of Expanded Arts. Although this ''As You Like It'' pays homage to Shakespeare's text, the characters will sometimes lip-synch their pain and joy to classics of American Soul and English Mod.</p>
        <p>Season's Greetings</p>
        <p>For those who are counting down, summer officially arrives in New York at 9:48 p.m. on Tuesday. For those who are getting up early on Saturday, the season can be celebrated at 4:30 a.m. in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, the setting for ''Celtic Solstice: Paul Winter's Seventh Annual Summer Solstice Celebration.'' Those on a different crepuscular schedule can attend performances at the cathedral at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow and Saturday, and the more torpid can hear the performance nationally next week on more than 150 public radio stations, including WFUV (90.7 FM) in the New York metropolitan area, and on the Internet. Among the performers are the saxophonist Mr. Winter, the uilleann piper Jerry O'Sullivan and the cathedral organist Dorothy Papadakos.</p>
