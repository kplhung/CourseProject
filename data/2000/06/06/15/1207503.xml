        <p>Russia's most powerful businessmen today condemned the arrest of Vladimir A. Gusinsky, the owner of Russia's leading independent media conglomerate, and warned that it threatened the nation's hard-won freedoms.</p>
        <p>''Until yesterday we believed that we lived in a democratic country and today we have serious doubts,'' 17 tycoons said in a letter to Russia's prosecutor-general.</p>
        <p>With the protest, the issue became more than just freedom of the press; it also reflected the uneasy relationship that President Vladimir V. Putin's young government has with the nation's power elite.</p>
        <p>The furor began on Tuesday when Russian authorities abruptly detained Mr. Gusinsky, 47, on suspicion of embezzling millions of dollars in government property. Mr. Gusinsky's supporters said the allegations were trumped up and were a politically inspired effort to punish the media mogul, who owns the nation's only independent television network, one that opposed the Kremlin in the recent elections and presented an unvarnished account of the war in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin initially expressed surprise at the arrest, leaving analysts unclear whether he was trying to distance himself from the move or was caught unaware by a policy driven by ambitious subordinates. Neither scenario, however, was very comforting to much of Russia's economic and political establishment.</p>
        <p>''A precedent has been established,'' the businessmen wrote in their letter today. ''One day all of us -- practically the entire business community -- could be listed as political opponents.''</p>
        <p>The signers included Rem Vyakhirev, the head of Gazprom, the world's largest natural gas company; Pyotr Aven, the president of Alphabank; Vladimir Potanin, a leading banker and industrialist; Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the head of the Yukos oil company, and Anatoly B. Chubais, the chief of United Energy System, Russia's electrical monopoly, and former top Kremlin aid.</p>
        <p>During the Yeltsin years, the Kremlin accepted the enormous power that the nation's new tycoons had accumulated. The government's power waned. Corruption was rampant. But the press was largely free.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin came to office vowing to rebuild the Kremlin's authority. With the arrest of Mr. Gusinsky, fears have grown that the new president and his men are not merely intent on diminishing the power of autocratic governors and tycoons but are prepared to punish powerful figures who fail to toe the government line.</p>
        <p>Many of Mr. Gusinsky's supporters do not know the details of the government's allegations against the media mogul. But they say that few businessmen in Russia have entirely clean hands and that the government decision to begin an anticorruption drive by jailing the owner of the nation's only independent media conglomerate was entirely political.</p>
        <p>In contrast to their handling of Mr. Gusinsky, for example, the Russian authorities have taken no action against Pavel Borodin, the former property manager for the Kremlin who helped bring Mr. Putin to Moscow and who has been accused of taking kickbacks. Just last week, Mr. Borodin's successor said he knew of no wrongdoing by his predecessor although the Swiss authorities have filed formal complaints against Mr. Borodin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky has drawn support from a variety of sources. Journalists have flocked to his defense. So has the Clinton administration. Today, Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of state, gave an interview to Mr. Gusinsky's television network, NTV, in which Mr. Talbott described the arrest as part of a disturbing pattern that has hurt Russia's standing abroad.</p>
        <p>Jewish groups have also assailed the move, citing Mr. Gusinsky's role as the head of one of Russia's leading Jewish organization.</p>
        <p>But some of the support is clearly self-interested. The Russian ''oligarchs'' --businessmen who acquired billions of dollars of property during Russia's hectic privatization -- who signed the letter in support of Mr. Gusinsky are worried the arrest might be the harbinger of a broader crackdown. ''There will certainly be someone up next, '' Mr. Aven, the Alphabank president, said today.</p>
        <p>Boris Berezovsky, a Gusinsky rival, did not join the letter, saying that Mr. Gusinsky had brought his problems upon himself but should not have been jailed.</p>
        <p>Moscow's pugnacious mayor, Yuri M. Luzhkov, insisted that Mr. Gusinsky be released from jail on his own recognizance. If the media executive fled the country, Mayor Luzhkov said, he would be happy to take his place in prison. It was a stunning offer, which captured the establishment's shock over the episode, but which nobody took seriously.</p>
        <p>The crisis also overshadowed Mr. Putin's highly publicized trip to Spain and Germany, where he had hoped to lure foreign investment and argue against American plans for a limited antimissile defense.</p>
        <p>Questioned about the arrest, Mr. Putin insisted it was the action of an independent prosecutor. But the prosecutor, Vladimir Ustinov, was appointed by Mr. Putin at the insistence of the Kremlin chief of staff, Aleksandr Voloshin, an official who served in the Yeltsin government  and has ties to the Yeltsin family and to Mr. Berezovsky. He is believed to have helped engineer the decision to select Mr. Putin as Mr. Yeltsin's successor.</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Putin's comments were not reassuring, at least not to supporters of Mr. Gusinsky. At one point, the Russian president asserted that Mr. Gusinsky's media conglomerate, MediaMost, was heavily in debt and suggested that one of its creditors, Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly, should take a tougher stance.</p>
        <p>''Several days ago, Gusinsky did not pay back another $200 million  loan, and Gazprom again paid the outstanding debt,'' Mr. Putin said. ''I wonder why Gazprom should spend money on this.''</p>
        <p>One major question is how much Mr. Putin knew in advance about the arrest. Igor Malashenko, a senior deputy to Mr. Gusinsky, suggested the arrest was the work of Mr. Voloshin. ''Putin is not the one who makes the decisions and doesn't control the situation in the country,'' Mr. Malashenko said.</p>
        <p>But Liliya Shevtsova, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the move was part of the new president's push to expand his authority over the nation's regions, its media and its business leaders.</p>
        <p>''He is interested in the domestic balance of power,'' she said. ''He is not interested in the foreign reaction.</p>
        <p>Some former politicians joined the criticism. Yevgeny Primakov, the former prime minister, said, ''I am awfully outraged, because they very clearly wanted to shock or possibly intimidate the public.''</p>
