        <p>IF the world can be divided into two categories -- things that are fun to buy and things that are not -- I think we all know on which list to put garden hoses. Perhaps a truly dedicated shopper could work up some enthusiasm debating the benefits of making the leap to a soaker hose, but not me.</p>
        <p>Not that I am against soakers, ingeniously designed to drip water through tiny pinholes so the neighbors will not know you are violating drought restrictions to save the phlox. I support them as a necessary accessory to my suburban lifestyle.</p>
        <p>But buying any kind of hose wasn't a top priority, especially since it didn't seem like the sort of item I would quickly purchase online while sitting at my desk, ostensibly working.  When my collection of old, mostly green hoses started to crack and leak this spring, I figured the solution would be to sort through the circulars in the Sunday newspaper to see which local garden-supply store had them on sale. The plan probably would have worked, if it weren't for my new hammock, which arrived when the lilacs were in bloom and forced me to fall asleep before I had read halfway through the good sections.</p>
        <p>So I was very relieved to learn last week about a Web site called Shoppinglist.com, which will sort through the circulars for you and then send you to a sale at a local store to buy what you need. The site does the research online, then you make the purchase the old-fashioned way: get into the car, drive over to the store and stand for 10 minutes in front of a display of garden hoses trying to decide: black or green?</p>
        <p>''When the company was founded back in 1998, the idea of using the Web to send people to local stores instead of to a Web site to buy something was considered heresy,'' said Jeff Greenberg, Shoppinglist.com's president and chief executive. ''We came up with the idea because the company founder's mother-in-law was visiting and said she was going out to the mall. What was she going to buy? She said, 'If I already knew what was on sale, I could tell you.' ''</p>
        <p>The approach makes sense because more than 68 percent of online buyers say they still use the Internet to research products that they purchase in stores, according to Jupiter Communications, more proof that the Internet is also revolutionizing offline shopping habits. Shoppinglist.com is one of a number of sites -- like Eversave.com and Salesmountain.com -- that hope to capitalize on that trend by steering shoppers to sales at local stores.</p>
        <p>Using proprietary software to sort through newspaper and direct-mail advertisements nationwide to find sales, Shoppinglist.com organizes the results in a searchable database that allows shoppers to hunt for about 30,000 products, in categories like apparel or food or toys, that 6,800 retailers are selling in 140,000 stores nationwide. After a shopper enters a Zip code, Shoppinglist.com suggests a nearby store, which may be a national chain like Sears or Kmart, or a local or regional retailer. Shoppinglist.com's database is updated hourly, Mr. Greenberg said.</p>
        <p>The service is free to shoppers. Shoppinglist.com has begun to sign up a few retailers willing to pay for enhanced display on the Web site, but for now the site is supported primarily by private investors, Mr. Greenberg said.</p>
        <p>After testing the service last week, I can see why retailers might sign up. Shopping online is safe -- I generally don't browse but instead go after a specific item I already have identified. But, once inside a store, I am confronted by tempting displays of merchandise that I otherwise never would have known I absolutely had to have to augment my summer lifestyle.</p>
        <p>Shoppinglist.com sent me to a nearby Target store, where I planned to buy either a hose that cost $6.99 or a hose that cost $9.99 (I won't bore you with the details). But by the time I got out of there 30 minutes later, I had spent more than $88 on additional items: a chrome standing fan, two bottles of children's combination bug repellant-sunscreen and an oscillating sprinkler, which proved to be more interesting than a hose because it came in yellow.</p>
        <p>I don't blame Shoppinglist.com for my added expenditures. However, had I succumbed to the temptation of the moment and purchased a $6.99 garden trowel designed by Michael Graves and displayed enticingly at the end of the hose aisle, I might not be feeling so magnanimous now. The only real complaint I had was that some of the items advertised on Shoppinglist.com weren't available at stores. For instance, a $16.99 hose reel (a contraption to hold a hose) was out of stock at a local Sears, a fact I learned only after a 20-minute drive to the store.</p>
        <p>The next time I used Shoppinglist.com, I called first and learned that a local True Value hardware did not carry a $17.99 advertised hose reel cart. That saved me a 30-minute drive. (Shoppinglist.com plans to add a feature to the site to link to partner retailers' inventory so shoppers know whether an item is in stock, Mr. Greenberg said.)</p>
        <p>Sometimes even when an item is available, once you see it you realize you don't want it. At a local Frank's Nursery Center, I found a tall stack of the $12.99 hoses advertised on Shoppinglist.com. But in the end, I passed them up for an $8.99 model. I have to admit, I am a little excited about the prospect of hooking it up; it will be my first green soaker.</p>
