        <p>Ticker tape, shmicker tape.</p>
        <p>Rangers' fans boast about their team's 1994 victory romp through a downpour of shredded trash, but they will never know the pleasures of a good tailgate party. As tens of thousands of fans of the New Jersey Devils  poured into the Continental Airlines Arena parking lot today, they wanted the world to know that their celebratory bash was not second-rate.</p>
        <p>The Rangers may have had their moment in what some call the Canyon of Heroes along lower Broadway, but organizers said 45,000 fans showed up yesterday at the Devils' Stanley Cup celebration at the team's home arena in the Meadowlands, where they had free parking, acres of asphalt and face-painting booths staffed by attendants who smeared black and red makeup across the cheeks of the devotees.</p>
        <p>There were even appearances by local celebrities: Gov. Christine Todd Whitman came by to kiss the cup, as did Joe Nolan, the traffic reporter for the radio station WPLJ-FM, who pumped up the crowd by slandering the Rangers.</p>
        <p>As one fan, Bob Azarian of North Arlington, N.J., grilled a batch of White Castle hamburgers for his buddies, he gestured proudly to the throng of revelers, nearly all of them dressed in Devils' caps and jerseys.</p>
        <p>''This is better than any parade,'' he said, pooh-poohing suggestions that their moment of glory was less than glorious. ''All the people here are hard-core fans, because only a real fan would drive to a party in a parking lot.'' This is true.</p>
        <p>For the second time in six seasons, the Devils have brought home the holy grail of hockey, solidifying their reputation as one of the most formidable teams in the National Hockey League.</p>
        <p>But despite its success on the ice, the team has had trouble shedding its image as a swamp-bound franchise that often finds itself playing to sparse crowds. After the first Stanley Cup victory in 1995, the Devils endured unrelenting jokes about their parking lot cavalcade, which drew 20,000 people.</p>
        <p>This time the team's owner, John McMullen, turned down offers from Bayonne, Hoboken and Newark to hold a traditional parade, choosing instead to give the Devils' fans a family-style party in a setting they know and love.</p>
        <p>''We'll have it here at the Meadowlands,'' he explained, ''because our fans know how to get here.''</p>
        <p>But even the most faithful said they felt the unshakable sting of inferiority, a sentiment that is only magnified by gibes from the New York and Philadelphia news media that dominate the state.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Pigna, 39, a fan from the days when the Devils were known as the ''Mickey Mouse operation,'' said he cried for joy as he watched his team beat the Dallas Stars just after midnight on Sunday. He brought his wife and 1-year-old son to the festivities, but he had been hoping for a grander celebration, he said.</p>
        <p>''This is nice, but it's a little makeshift,'' he said, surrounded by vendors selling plastic bottles of beer, pretzels and souvenirs. ''I think the Devils deserve better.''</p>
        <p>Still, most fans seemed to appreciate the small-town camaraderie of the gathering, which felt like a cross between a rock concert and an outdoor weenie roast.</p>
        <p>After a hard-edged performance by the Dog Voices, the Devils' official band, the crowd cheered as the winning moments of Sunday's game were projected on giant screens.</p>
        <p>Then, one by one, the players mounted a stage, followed by the Stanley Cup, which was wheeled out by white-gloved attendants sent to the celebration by the Hockey Hall of Fame. As Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain, held the cup aloft, a burst of red-and-white fireworks exploded overhead and silver confetti showered down.</p>
        <p>Even though he lives on Long Island, Mike Ellinas, 29, regularly makes the drive to the New Jersey Meadowlands to see the Devils. ''All my friends think I'm a traitor,'' said Mr. Ellinas, an accountant from Massapequa Park.</p>
        <p>Moments before he joined his teammates on the stage, Jason Arnott was asked what he thought of the site of the celebration. ''As long as you can hold the cup over your head,'' he said, ''it doesn't matter where you have your party.''</p>
