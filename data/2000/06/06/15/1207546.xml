        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency needs to strengthen the research it conducts to support its regulations and to create a position overseeing science agencywide, a panel of experts recommended today.</p>
        <p>A committee of the National Research Council said the environmental agency had in recent years improved the quantity and quality of the science used to underpin its regulations. But the panel added that there was so much research being done by the E.P.A. and for it that the agency needed greater coordination to ensure its effectiveness.</p>
        <p>The senior science official in the agency, an assistant administrator for research and development, does not have agencywide responsibility or authority to oversee all of the science needed for policy making, the panel said, and the agency's regulatory offices are not required to follow the scientific advice coming from that office.</p>
        <p>''E.P.A. needs an appropriately qualified science official at a sufficiently high level to carry both the authority and responsibility for agencywide scientific performance,'' the committee said in its report. ''No official below the level of deputy administrator could perform that role because interrelated scientific and technical activities are conducted throughout the agency.''</p>
        <p>The National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, noted that the agency had taken the advice of a 1995 interim report from the same committee to strengthen its Office of Research and Development. But, the panel admitted, it underestimated the level of authority needed to coordinate all of the scientific activities throughout the agency.</p>
        <p>There is a large amount of science and research in regulatory and regional offices that has equal status with the Office of Research and Development at E.P.A. headquarters, the panel said, and all of these offices could be competing for the same research money. To avoid conflicts of interests and questions of authority in overseeing research, a higher level office with agencywide authority is needed, the committee said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Paul G. Risser, president of Oregon State University and chairman of the committee, said the agency had made significant strides in the last three to four years in improving its research and coordinating its activities. In the past, Dr. Risser said, the agency has been criticized for the quality of its science and how it used that work in formulating regulations.</p>
        <p>''The E.P.A. over the long term hasn't had the reputation for performing the highest quality science,'' Dr. Risser said in an interview. ''But it really has made some significant strides, including planning research for more than a year at a time, looking at long-term research and not just short-term regulatory research, improving the peer review of its work and summarizing its research so that more people know what it's doing.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Risser said the appointment of a deputy director of science, with the same level of authority as the current deputy director who deals with regulation, would be a recognition  that the agency's scientific activities were as important as its regulatory work.</p>
        <p>Some critics have suggested that the E.P.A. stop doing its own research and contract its scientific activities to universities and other outside parties. But, Dr. Risser said: ''The panel felt that it would be a big mistake to have the E.P.A. stop doing science. That would severely impair the agency's ability to understand the environmental science and to do its regulatory job.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Norine Noonan, the agency's assistant administrator for research, said in a statement that she was pleased with the progress acknowledged in the report and that the agency would examine the feasibility of its recommendations.</p>
        <p>The report said that in 1999, the agency's research branch had a staff of 1,976 at 12 scientific laboratories around the country, and at 3 field offices, 3 assessment offices and the E.P.A.'s headquarters here. In that year, the agency had a budget of $559 million, of which $315 million went to activities outside the agency, like grants, contracts, fellowships and cooperative agreements with other institutions.</p>
        <p>The committee was made up of 14 people, among them scientists, former government officials and representatives from industry and research groups.</p>
