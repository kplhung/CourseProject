        <p>Bond prices rose sharply yesterday after a government report on consumer prices for May showed no acceleration in inflation.</p>
        <p>The report bolstered investor sentiment that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates again when its policy makers meet on June 27 and 28.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year bond gained 17/32 , to 104 26/32  while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.91 percent from 5.94 percent on Tuesday. The 10-year note rose 16/32 , to 103 12/32 ; its yield dropped to 6.03 percent from 6.11 percent.</p>
        <p>Prices of government securities turned higher after the Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose a less-than-expected 0.1 percent in May, suggesting that the six interest rate increases over the last year are having the desired effect in slowing rapid growth.</p>
        <p>Even with the good news, the market rally fluctuated, leaving some market participants believing that they have already seen the best of the data showing benign inflation. Elsewhere, traders said an overnight purchase of longer-maturity Treasuries on the open market by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York lifted prices at the longer end of the yield curve.</p>
        <p>''The debate over whether the recent softness in economic data presages a definitive slowdown in the pace of business activity or is merely a pause in the economy's momentum continues to command center stage among market participants,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. ''Nevertheless, the economy has built up a lot of steam and is not likely to come to a sudden, screeching halt.''</p>
        <p>''In the face of still-buoyant economic growth and tight labor markets,'' he added, the Federal Open Market Committee ''will continue to regard inflation as being the major risk to economic well-being, and thus further Fed tightenings seem probable as the year progresses, although the F.O.M.C. is expected to remain on hold and defer any action at its meeting on June 28.''</p>
        <p>At first glance, inflation as measured by the C.P.I. appeared benign in May, but looks can be deceiving, Mr. Fine said. A timing quirk in the method for calculating the index produced a sharp drop in gasoline prices and did not include much of the increase in airline fares. He thinks the June C.P.I. could paint a drastically different picture.</p>
        <p>After a weaker-than-expected retail sales report earlier this week, Richard DeKaser, chief economist for the National City Corporation in Cleveland, said the financial markets should be careful not to overinterpret that news as evidence of newly emerged weakness. That would be as inaccurate as exaggerating the strength apparent earlier this year.</p>
        <p>''The outlook for Fed policy is unchanged,'' he said, ''with no move expected in two weeks.''</p>
