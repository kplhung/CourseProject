        <p>In the computer age, ''multimedia'' usually means the audio and video on a Web page. But for Randall Packer, a composer and artist in Washington, the word has a certain ''Ring'' to it. In ''Multimedia: From Wagner to Virtual Reality,'' a history project installed this week on Intel's ArtMuseum.net site, Mr. Packer argues that the Internet's multimedia capabilities have descended from the fusion of the arts envisioned by Richard Wagner, the 19th-century composer of opera's ''Ring'' cycle.</p>
        <p>''We normally think of multimedia as text, graphics, sound, video, animation,'' Mr. Packer said. ''This is presenting multimedia as a set of ideas that are much broader.''</p>

        <p>In the computer age, ''multimedia'' usually means the audio and video on a Web page. But for Randall Packer, a composer and artist in Washington, the word has a certain ''Ring'' to it. In ''Multimedia: From Wagner to Virtual Reality,'' a history project installed this week on Intel's ArtMuseum.net site, Mr. Packer argues that the Internet's multimedia capabilities have descended from the fusion of the arts envisioned by Richard Wagner, the 19th-century composer of opera's ''Ring'' cycle.</p>
        <p>''We normally think of multimedia as text, graphics, sound, video, animation,'' Mr. Packer said. ''This is presenting multimedia as a set of ideas that are much broader.''</p>
        <p>The site's Pioneers area uses an interactive time line to demonstrate the relationship between the arts and high technology.</p>
        <p>Wagner's experiments with sound and lighting presage the immersive experience of virtual-reality environments, the site says, just as the cut-up texts from William S. Burroughs are antecedents of hypertext fiction. In a decade of research, Mr. Packer said, he was surprised to discover how many engineers had grasped the artistic implications of their high-tech developments.</p>
        <p>''I thought they were nerds who only thought about hardware,'' he said. ''Little did I know there were engineers who thought very philosophically about the way machines would open up new forms of creativity.''</p>
