        <p>The House overwhelmingly passed an electronic-signature and record-keeping bill today that proponents say will move electronic commerce to a whole new level.</p>
        <p>The legislation, passed 426 to 4, would give new technologies like fingerprint scans and encryption keys the legal weight of ink-and-paper signatures, making it easier for both companies and consumers to do business online. The Senate is expected to pass the bill later this week and the President said today that he would sign the law, which is a compromise that took high-technology companies, the financial industries lobby and consumer groups nearly a year to negotiate.</p>
        <p>''For the first time in history you will be able to engage in e-commerce transactions across state lines and know for certain that the contracts that you signed electronically are valid across all 50 states,'' said Rick Lane, a lobbyist on high-technology issues for the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''It really is one of the final hurdles for e-commerce to grow to its fullest potential.''</p>
        <p>For instance, computer users would be able to take out mortgages, buy insurance, even enter a binding contract with their roofer without ever leaving their home, signing a piece of paper or waiting for the back-and-forth of mailed paperwork.</p>
        <p>And businesses negotiating contracts with each other could enter binding agreements without having to send paper documents overnight.</p>
        <p>''It is about laying the legal foundation of electronic commerce for many years to come,'' said Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., a Virginia Republican who is chairman of the House Commerce Committee. ''It is about promoting the development of new technologies that will enable consumers and businesses to have greater certainty and security in their transactions.''</p>
        <p>Online commerce until now has focused mostly on shopping. And while some financial institutions already take applications online, the final step still needs to happen in the physical world.</p>
        <p>The bill is technology-neutral, meaning the parties involved in digital contracts will be able to choose what system they want to use to validate an electronic agreement. Many Internet browsers have authentication features. Some computers also have stylus screens that users can actually use to scrawl their normal signature into their computer. And there are a growing number of companies that provide services to help companies and consumers enter electronic contracts.</p>
        <p>The bill would provide an incentive for the companies to put more information online by eliminating paper record-keeping requirements on financial institutions that move to secure electronic storage systems.</p>
        <p>''For consumers who choose this channel, we'll save money on contacting and record-keeping, and a consumer who wants to access their information online doesn't have to be bombarded with paper and will be saved all of their desk space,'' said Michael Hogan, senior vice president and general counsel of DLJ Direct, an online brokerage firm.</p>
        <p>As a safeguard, the Clinton administration and consumer groups were able to secure provisions in the proposed law that will still require that crucial notices like final utility cutoff warnings, insurance cancellation and mortgage foreclosure notices be sent on paper.</p>
        <p>Before consumers move their dealings with a company into cyberspace, they will be sent a test e-mail and a document to confirm that their computer is capable of reading the format that the company uses to store and send its records.</p>
