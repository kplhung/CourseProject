        <p>Shaquille O'Neal dubbed Kobe Bryant and himself the Combo earlier this season, the most lethal 1-2 punch in the National Basketball Association. ''If the big left doesn't get you,'' he said, ''the right will.''</p>
        <p>Both weapons fired again tonight at the Conseco Fieldhouse, and oh, how the Indiana Pacers and their loud legions felt the pain.</p>
        <p>Returning from an ankle injury just in time to help his indestructible 7-foot-1-inch teammate, Bryant knifed through the lane, hitting impossible hanging layups and jump shots, and scored 28 points in 47 scintillating minutes.</p>
        <p>Throw in O'Neal's performance, 36 points and 21 rebounds, and the persevering Los Angeles Lakers moved within one game of the first National Basketball Association championship of the Shaq-and-Kobe era, winning Game 4 of the finals, 120-118, in overtime.</p>
        <p>''These are type of games you watch growing up,'' said Bryant. ''The kind of game where they can't stop you from scoring and you can't stop them from scoring. I've dreamed about winning a game like this all my life.''</p>
        <p>In the most severe challenge of his young career, at a time when many of his high school classmates were graduating from college, the 21-year-old guard scored 8 of his 28 points in overtime, including a putback layup off Brian Shaw's missed runner with 5.9 seconds left.</p>
        <p>That basket protected a 3-point lead, 120-117, but still did not end the game. When Rick Fox fouled Reggie Miller away from the ball before the inbounds pass -- an automatic free throw -- Miller sank the free throw and the Pacers were down by only two.</p>
        <p>After the timeout, Miller sprinted around a double-screen on the right baseline. Mark Jackson rifled him the ball, and with all of Indiana holding its breath and the outstretched arm of Robert Horry in his face, Miller fired a long 3-pointer from the right wing. It went high off the left side of the back rim, rolling away as time expired.</p>
        <p>So, O'Neal, Bryant and the Lakers prevailed over Miller and the Pacers in a breathless shootout. They went back and forth in the final minutes, the pendulum swinging in the series each time Bryant or Miller fired a shot.</p>
        <p>Bryant made 14 of 27 shots and contributed four rebounds and 5 assists. O'Neal made 10 of 17 free throws, finished with 36 points and 21 rebounds before fouling out with 2:33 left in overtime.</p>
        <p>Miller led everyone with 35 points, connecting on 6 of 9 3-pointers, 11 of 12 free throws and bringing the building to its feet several times over the final minutes of regulation and overtime.</p>
        <p>Just as quickly as the fans rose, Bryant sat them down. He put the Lakers ahead 116-113 with 1:20 remaining in overtime with a 23-footer over Jackson from deep on the left side.</p>
        <p>Bryant's right wrist was posed in a follow-through motion as he backpedaled downcourt, looking like Michael Jordan when he shot down Utah in the final seconds of Game 6 of the 1998 finals.</p>
        <p>Miller made two free throws with 1:05 remaining to creep within 1 again before Bryant put the game away.</p>
        <p>''When I fouled out, Kobe just looked at me and said, 'Don't worry, I got it,' said O'Neal, who went over Smits's back with 2:33 remaining in overtime. ''That's what you need when you have a 1-2 punch. When you injure your left hand, you need your right to step up and knock out the opponent.''</p>
        <p>''A great game,'' Lakers Coach Phil Jackson said. ''Kobe was great. He carried us during that period of time. He smelled it at the end of the game, when Shaq was out. And he lifted us.''</p>
        <p>Jackson was asked for comparisons to Jordan afterward, but he deftly maneuvered around the question. O'Neal was impressed.</p>
        <p>''Me being a student of the game, I know every team needs a 1-2 punch,'' he said. ''Me on the inside. Kobe on the outside. He was the hero tonight. I'm just glad I'm part of this legendary 1-2 punch.''</p>
        <p>Bryant said: ''This is the game I dream about every day. I dreamed about it on the way over there. With 2.3 seconds left in regulation, that was going to be it, I thought. I just had to wait for overtime.''</p>
        <p>Over the last four minutes of regulation Miller and O'Neal went at each other like prizefighters, O'Neal dunking, Miller rising up and releasing from 24 feet and farther. After O'Neal gave the Lakers a 99-98 lead, Miller unleashed another bomb, this one from the right wing to give Indiana a 101-99 lead with 3:16 left in regulation.</p>
        <p>O'Neal then made 1 of 2 free throws with 2:23 left in regulation, and seconds later he missed two more.</p>
        <p>Bryant made a set-back jumper with 1:39 left in the fourth quarter to give the Lakers the lead, 102-101. After an Indiana miss, O'Neal made one of two free throws to make the score 103-101 with 1:02 remaining. Horry added another free throw with 44.8 seconds left to make it 104-101.</p>
        <p>Sam Perkins hit a 3-pointer with 35.8 seconds remaining form the right wing, and the Lakers, shaken, turned the ball the over when Horry threw an entry pass to Glen Rice away. With 17.4 seconds remaining Indiana took a timeout.</p>
        <p>On the inbounds, Travis Best got the ball and dribbled on the left wing, where he was suddenly guarded by O'Neal. Unsure of what to do, Best stepped back and released a 15-foot jump shot that went 14 feet, hitting the side of the rim and giving the Lakers possession with 2.3 seconds left. After a timeout, Shaw inbounded the ball to O'Neal at the right of the free throw line. O'Neal took a wild hook shot that bounced twice off the rim and bounced away harmlessly at the buzzer.</p>
        <p>The Lakers had regained the lead after falling behind by 5 when O'Neal scored underneath. After a Miller reverse layup, Derek Fisher nailed a 3-pointer to give the Lakers a 2-point lead with five minutes left.</p>
        <p>After dueling inside baskets from Best and O'Neal, Miller came right back moments later -- burying his own 3-pointer from the left baseline with 4 minutes left, a shot that gave Indiana a 98-97 lead.</p>
