        <p>FOR me, poppies are like dogs. I never know when one is going to come into my life, or how long he or she will stick around. And it's almost a given that they never show up when or where they're supposed to.</p>
        <p>My dog, Red, for instance, who followed me one day to my house in Brooklyn, and kept showing up to howl at the door, no matter how many people I gave her away to, is now living the life of Riley down on the farm in Maryland. And she's pretty good about obeying ''Come!'' when it's time to come up from the meadow. But sometimes she will just stand stock-still halfway up the field, and with a glint in her eye, trot off in the other direction. Seeking herself in her old stray days of independence. I just go up to the barn. Because I know, five minutes later, she'll appear from behind some wall.</p>

        <p>FOR me, poppies are like dogs. I never know when one is going to come into my life, or how long he or she will stick around. And it's almost a given that they never show up when or where they're supposed to.</p>
        <p>My dog, Red, for instance, who followed me one day to my house in Brooklyn, and kept showing up to howl at the door, no matter how many people I gave her away to, is now living the life of Riley down on the farm in Maryland. And she's pretty good about obeying ''Come!'' when it's time to come up from the meadow. But sometimes she will just stand stock-still halfway up the field, and with a glint in her eye, trot off in the other direction. Seeking herself in her old stray days of independence. I just go up to the barn. Because I know, five minutes later, she'll appear from behind some wall.</p>
        <p>Poppies move in a different way. I've grown Papaver somniferum, the opium poppy, ever since a friend gave me some seeds for Christmas about 10 years ago. She told me to scatter them over bare ground in February -- better yet if it had snowed -- because the seeds need cold to break their dormancy. Do nothing after that, she said. No weeding, no thinning. Don't meddle. Just wait.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, by early May, masses of tiny pale-green leaves covered the patch of ground. As they grew bigger, I could see they were scalloped, like loose-leaf lettuce (which explains why some call this species the lettuce-leafed poppy). By early June, slender three-foot stems drooped with the weight of fat flower buds about the size of my thumb.  Then they lifted their heads toward the sky and opened into gossamer saucers of lavender and deep wine splotched with jet black.</p>
        <p>By late summer, I collected the black seeds from the dried pods -- which remind me of salt shakers, with their tiny holes set about the rims of the elegantly curved tops. I saved some for the next winter, when I would again scatter them over a patch of bare ground -- it must be bare, or the seeds won't grow -- and wait for their mystical blooms. I passed some along to other gardeners, including my friend Corky, who scattered them in his vegetable patch, which overlooks the green hills of Corinth, Vt.</p>
        <p>It was Corky who would give me seeds when my poppies, for some mysterious reason, disappeared a few years ago. I had probably let the weeds grow up, or not collected the seeds one summer. Or lost interest. And the poppies went away.</p>
        <p>So last winter, after a dinner of roast chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, Corky sent me home with a little film canister full of poppy seeds. It was March when I stood in my garden scattering them over a generous patch of ground. But it was a warm winter, with temperatures often in the 40's. Maybe it was too late for the seeds to break their dormancy. The poppies didn't come up.</p>
        <p>I was sad this spring when I scoured the ground and found nary a scalloped leaf. Corky died in April, at 78, after a long battle with cancer.</p>
        <p>So it goes in life and the garden, where some disease or hurricane or even a dog sitting on a seedling will crush the life out of something important. You pick up and go on, remembering the spirit of what and of whom you have lost. And the busyness of life tends to take over -- like the generator my brother, Jim, thought we should install for the old farmhouse, after several storms left my mother without power and water for days at a time last winter. He and Bernie, our genius handyman, installed the generator in the garage and then dug a trench for the power line that would bring electricity to the house the next time a few hundred trees fell over and everybody's furnace and pump went dead.</p>
        <p>(You should have heard the family debate over that one. The Southern survivalists: ''This is only going to get worse, so get the big generator.'' The steady New Englanders: ''Just pile up more wood; burn more candles.'' The Southerners won.)</p>
        <p>All this happened while I was in New York. I came down in early spring to a raw gash of red clay that stretched across the grass and through an old iris bed to the cellar.</p>
        <p>My bearded irises! Beautiful old yellow and brown ones that had bloomed faithfully for years. Now they were just a ragged bunch of rhizomes jammed helter-skelter into the soil. I put them back, as best I could, and covered them lightly with a bit of compost.</p>
        <p>Well, they bloomed their heads off last week. (And the generator came on when a ferocious thunderstorm took down a few utility lines on our road.) I went over to get a closer look, and started pulling a few weeds. There, among the sturdy iris stems, were the unmistakable blue-green lettuce leaves of Papaver somniferum.</p>
        <p>My poppies had moved!</p>
        <p>Maybe the wind had blown the seeds. Or maybe, just like the World War I bombs that blasted all those red corn poppy seeds (Papaver rhoeas) out of the fields of Flanders, in northwest France, my poppy seeds were just waiting for some force -- a trench digger would do -- to bust them out of darkness.</p>
        <p>I once heard something to that effect from Niall Kirkwood, a landscape architect and expert in using plants to remediate industrial landscapes. So I called him at Harvard University, where he teaches at the Graduate School of Design.</p>
        <p>''I first heard it from Sir Peter Shepherd, who headed the War Graves Commission, which administered all the graves of British soldiers throughout the world,'' Mr. Kirkwood said, remembering back 15 years ago when he was a student at the University of Pennsylvania, where Sir Peter was a professor.</p>
        <p>''He said that the shelling was so intense in France and Belgium -- the holes of the craters were so large -- that it threw up seed banks so deep in the ground, they had never come to the surface during normal plowing,'' Mr. Kirkwood recalled. ''As soon as the shelling had stopped and peace returned, suddenly the fields of devastation and death were covered with waving fields of red petals.''</p>
        <p>So the Flanders poppy became forever associated ''with not just death but resurrection,'' he said.</p>
        <p>My poppies are not red corn poppies. They are the old-fashioned purple and mauve opium poppies, which were stolen out of Southern yards by Confederate soldiers for the gummy laudanum in the ripening pods. (Don't worry, a spokesman at the Agriculture Department assured me years ago; it was O.K. to grow them, and no federal narcotics agents have shown up at the screen door.)</p>
        <p>And so I await their majestic blooming.</p>
        <p>I went up to Vermont last weekend to attend a memorial service for Corky. It was in an old Quaker meeting house, on a little road near the family farm, where people remembered his wit, his wide-ranging mind and deep memory, his greatness as a teacher, beer maker and gardener.</p>
        <p>As he got weaker, his children said, he moved his garden to a sheltered spot behind the house, where he would sit and watch things grow, listen to the wind, observe the life teeming in a dead butternut tree he left standing in the garden.</p>
        <p>It was his tree of mortality, his children said. He liked seeing how it took part in life after death.</p>
        <p>Last weekend, we stood outside the old house taking in the view of the green hills beyond. It was a fine day to celebrate Corky's spirit. And I wondered where his poppies would show up next.</p>
