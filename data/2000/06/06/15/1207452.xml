        <p>An ambulette driver was charged with robbery, assault and unlawful imprisonment yesterday, accused of taking two women who suffered from mental disabilities on a drug-fueled six-hour ride through the streets of Brooklyn, the police said.</p>
        <p>The driver, Marvin Beeler, 32, picked up the first woman, Chanel Williams, at a rehabilitation center in Flatbush about noon on Tuesday,  the police said. Mr. Beeler then picked up the second woman, Tiy Bharath, at her home at 557 Montauk Avenue in East New York.</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams, 20, is mentally retarded and Ms. Bharath, 26, suffers from cerebral palsy, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Beeler, who works for Leon's Ambulette Service, was supposed to have taken the women to Jamaica Hospital in Queens for treatment, the police said they never made it.</p>
        <p>Instead, he took the two women on a circuitous journey through Kings County before summarily dumping them on a sidewalk at Fulton Street and Warrick Street, the police said.</p>
        <p>An hour later, Mr. Beeler returned to the street corner where he had left the two women and discovered that they were still there, officials of the Brooklyn District Attorney's office said.</p>
        <p>This time, Mr. Beeler robbed them of their money, their jewelry and a cell phone, the officials added.</p>
        <p>The authorities said that later that night, about 7:30, Ms. Williams's family grew concerned and called the police.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beeler was eventually tracked down in his van, in which the police said they discovered a pipe filled with the residue of crack cocaine.</p>
        <p>A woman who answered the telephone at Leon's Ambulette Service yesterday refused to comment on Mr. Beeler's arrest.</p>
