        <p>LIKE thousands of loyal suburbanites, we packed up and went to the Devils' party last night, easing down Route 3 and into the Canyon of Sport Utility Vehicles. It couldn't have been easier, more convenient, unless John McMullen had brought the Stanley Cup to Brookdale Park in Montclair, minutes from where we both live.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, parking there is tight, and the county police tend to ticket.</p>
        <p>Here at the Meadowlands, there were spots to be had and giant screens so all could see.</p>
        <p>''We don't need no stinkin' Canyon of Heroes, do we?'' boomed a voice from the stage, which, appropriately enough, belonged to Joe Nolan, a television traffic reporter.</p>
        <p>Considering the number of children in strollers, on roller blades and on fathers' shoulders, we didn't need no canyons or street corners. We had room, with a view. We had hot dog stands. We had port-a-potties aplenty.</p>
        <p>''More interactive,'' sang Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. ''It's better than standing around to see the team for 10 seconds.''</p>
        <p>All we needed was Scott Stevens to come out with the cup and the fireworks to go off. And there you have it, the complete and utter transformation of a native New Yorker. He who spent half his childhood in the upper deck of a Bronx shrine, who slept on the sidewalk outside Madison Square Garden so he could worship Willis Reed's championship Knicks, allowing his kids to pay homage in the parking lot.</p>
        <p>So this is what passed for a Devils parade. So what? As the stubborn-to-a-fault McMullen asked, wasn't that where they played this entire championship season? The team he moved here from Colorado 18 years ago has always been a sports anomaly, a team with no civic center. Why should it pretend to have one now, just because it won the cup?</p>
        <p>The Newark move under the new ownership may be inevitable, and it is one I wrote favorably about several weeks ago, with the assumption that the YankeeNets group was prepared to put up $200 million for the new arena. Then the telephone rang in the office one afternoon, and it was George Steinbrenner's spokesman,  Howard Rubenstein, calling to say how delighted everyone in the organization was with the column except for one little detail. No one had ever pledged $200 million to build anything, which I immediately took to be Steinbrenner's way of introducing his build-me business tactics to New Jersey taxpayers.</p>
        <p>If that's the case, then the parking lot will be just fine for future cup celebrations, too, thank you very much. I am not about to campaign to have anyone's tax dollars spent so my kids or anyone else's will have a classier place to yell hooray.</p>
        <p>The modern sports owner loves to hear such denunciations of existing facilities by the news media and by fans, because it invariably gives pandering politicians more excuses to cave in to their demands. Do the fans of New Jersey deserve a more modern sports arena that is reachable by mass transit? Why not? Just be aware that the new retro sports palace that bathes you in character tends to come with a cost, and has little to do with class.</p>
        <p>So-called character is typically achieved with overpriced club seating, and choice levels for luxury suites. It is about fewer seats for families, and those that remain are much higher up. I read something in Sports Illustrated recently that was quite startling -- if you put the cozy, old Boston Garden inside the clammy new FleetCenter, 47 percent of the FleetCenter's seats would be outside the Garden's walls.</p>
        <p>I'm all for Newark, as long as the new arena isn't publicly paid for and doesn't become a site that caters to the corporate, leaving families so far outside the lower bowl that they might as well be in the parking lot.</p>
        <p>One thing becomes clear when you actually go to a Devils game, or their Stanley Cup party. They have no reason to be jealous of the Rangers, whose overall crowd is one of the most child-unfriendly in all of professional sports, section upon section of tanked-up, foul-mouthed 20- or 30-somethings out on the company dole. At a Garden hockey game, the last thing you want to parade around is your child. I tried this a couple of years ago with an 8-year-old and a 4-year-old, and it was a nightmare, from the spilling of the ceremonial first beer.</p>
        <p>Even when they stink, which they sure did this season, the Rangers sell out more than the Devils do. What can I say other than we just seem to have more people out here who have better things to do with their time, like watch our children play for free.</p>
        <p>And frankly, the smaller crowds and concession lines at these professional sports events is, when you think about it, great news for those of us out of club-seat and waiter-service range.</p>
        <p>Shorter concession lines. Much smaller odds of a cold beer dumped on your head. And if your team has something to celebrate, an estimated 45,000 fans in the parking lot and not a single reported arrest.</p>
        <p>It's great, as long as you beat the traffic out.</p>
