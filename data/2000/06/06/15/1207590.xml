        <p>A man fatally stabbed his girlfriend early yesterday morning on an empty Long Island Rail Road platform in Westbury after the two argued over breaking up, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man, Jose Manuel Santos, 38, repeatedly stabbed Emilia Moise, 24, in the neck, using a folding knife with a three-inch blade, after he told her he wanted to break up with her, said Detective Sgt. William Cocks of the Nassau County police.</p>
        <p>The argument broke out around 12:30 a.m. on the eastbound platform of the station, shortly after the two, who had just left work in a nearby restaurant, had had sex in a dark tunnel beneath the platforms, Sergeant Cocks said. ''They walk routinely to this station after work to do what they do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Santos, of Hicksville, was arrested shortly after the killing and charged with second-degree murder. He was arraigned yesterday and held without bail at the Nassau County jail.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moise, of Westbury, had worked as a cashier for six years and Mr. Santos as a cook for seven years at Nathan's, a hot dog restaurant on Old Country Road in Westbury. The two had been dating for three years, the police said.</p>
        <p>But managers at Nathan's said they did not know the two were involved.</p>
        <p>''She's a very nice person,'' said Angelo Cordoro, the assistant manager there. ''I can't picture that in my head, that really happening.''</p>
        <p>Miguel Mendoza, the manager, said Mr. Santos had told him that he had a wife and five children in El Salvador and that he was sending money to support them. ''It was a surprise to me,'' Mr. Mendoza said. ''He looked like a quiet guy, a nice guy.''</p>
        <p>On May 20, Mr. Santos and Ms. Moise got into an argument at Ms. Moise's home, prompting her to call the police, the authorities said. There were no arrests.</p>
