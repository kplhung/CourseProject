        <p>Administration lawyers have advised President Clinton that, in their view, he could begin building the first piece of a national missile defense system without violating a 1972 arms control treaty with Russia, senior officials said.</p>
        <p>The lawyers' interpretations, which were drafted at the White House's request, are likely to be rejected by Russia, and the president has not made a decision on them. But they offer Mr. Clinton a way to announce that the United States would go ahead with missile defenses while letting the next administration decide whether to break the Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</p>
        <p>The prospect of withdrawing from the treaty has already threatened to undermine relations with Russia, as well as with European allies who view the pact as a foundation of nuclear arms control. But a delay in construction of a missile defense could leave Mr. Clinton, and especially Vice President Al Gore, vulnerable to Republican criticism in the middle of the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>The lawyers' findings could allow work on a defense system to begin while giving Mr. Clinton and his successor another year to decide whether to abrogate the treaty. The findings could also give the United States more time to test its nascent antimissile system and to negotiate with Moscow and with Washington's allies in hopes of averting a crisis in arms control.</p>
        <p>''Basically the administration is working hard to free up as much wiggle room as it can before it has to make a decision,'' one administration official said. ''And that makes sense. There's still a long way to go to come to an arrangement with the Russians.''</p>
        <p>The advice would overturn a legal understanding dating from the Reagan administration that even the most minimal steps to construct parts of a missile defense -- laying concrete, for example, or raising walls -- would breach the treaty.</p>
        <p>The advice amounts to a unilateral interpretation of the treaty, and if the president embraces it the Russians will almost certainly object to this broader legal opinion. But the approach may also be welcomed in Moscow to the extent that it avoids a diplomatic crisis over missile defense early in Vladimir V. Putin's presidency.</p>
        <p>Under the administration's own timetable, President Clinton is to decide this fall whether to begin breaking ground in Alaska next spring on a defensive system that would ultimately protect against a limited missile attack from countries the United States considers rogue states: Iran, Iraq and North Korea. In positive talks this week, the North has tried to improve its image with South Korea and lay the foundation for reunification.</p>
        <p>There is universal agreement that American plans to place a sophisticated radar system and 100 missile interceptors at Shemya Island in the western Aleutians would violate the treaty unless Russian negotiators agree to amend the pact, which they have so far steadfastly refused to do.</p>
        <p>The question, however, is: at what point in developing missile defenses would the United States stand in violation?</p>
        <p>Now, lawyers from the State Department, Pentagon and National Security Council have written a classified legal analysis that, if accepted by Mr. Clinton, would greatly expand what the administration has considered to be allowable under the treaty, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Administration and military officials have said that workers could clear trees and dig dirt at the proposed radar site on Shemya but that to go as far as laying a building foundation would cross the line.</p>
        <p>The administration's timetable for making a decision this fall was based on the treaty's requirement for a six-month notice of an intent to withdraw. Since workers would have to begin pouring concrete in a relatively short construction window during Alaska's warm summer months next year, that notification would have to come by the end of this year.</p>
        <p>But after about five months of research, the lawyers have concluded that the treaty could be interpreted to allow far more work at the radar site at Shemya before the United States was deemed in violation.</p>
        <p>''As in so many situations, it's a mix of common sense, a technical understanding of what's being contemplated and applicable law,'' said an administration official familiar with the lawyers' analysis.</p>
        <p>The first option, the lawyers concluded, was that contractors could pour a concrete pad without violating the treaty. Two other options allow even more construction, with the third and final interpretation permitting a concrete structure with metal tracks to hold the radar.</p>
        <p>''There are several points where you could reach a violation of the treaty,'' said Capt. Stephen R. Pietropaoli, a Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman. ''The lawyers have produced points along a continuum and the legal analysis to back each up.''</p>
        <p>Asked today how the threshold for violating the treaty for most of Mr. Clinton's tenure -- pouring concrete -- could suddenly become the basis for a broader interpretation permitting construction, a senior Pentagon official said, ''Better lawyers.''</p>
        <p>American officials have discussed the issue with the Russians in a series of meetings, though not during Mr. Clinton's visit with President Putin early this month, according to one official. Mr. Clinton himself was briefed on the legal options shortly before that visit.</p>
        <p>The official said that Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and John D. Holum, the chief arms control negotiator, have tried to determine from the Russians at what point in the construction of the radar they would object.</p>
        <p>So far, the officials said, the Russians have stuck to a stricter interpretation that considers ground-breaking a violation. But an official said that in talks at the summit, ''I think there was a willingness to find some clarity'' from the Russians.</p>
        <p>American officials are also wary of accepting the broadest of the lawyers' new interpretations because of the precedent it would set -- should Russia someday begin work on its own defense system.</p>
        <p>''There isn't a right answer,'' said John J. Hamre, who recently stepped down as deputy defense secretary. ''It's what you feel you can live with if it comes back to you from the other side.''</p>
        <p>The reason a battery of lawyers is poring over construction timetables and structural plans is complicated, but dictated largely by a conflicting set of schedules, as well as the coming presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>American intelligence analysts have estimated that North Korea could have the capability to hit the United States with nuclear or chemical-tipped ballistic missiles by 2005. To build an antimissile system that meets that deadline, officials have said, construction must begin at the Alaska site by next summer.</p>
        <p>Without an agreement to amend the treaty, however, Mr. Clinton faces a potentially contentious decision to announce his intent to withdraw if he keeps to the current schedule. Mr. Clinton has long expressed grave reservations about taking such a step, given that he and arms control advocates have called the treaty a cornerstone for American national security.</p>
        <p>''I do not want to throw out the ABM treaty,'' the president declared last October as the debate over a national missile defense heated up.</p>
        <p>On Capitol Hill, missile defense proponents expressed mixed feelings about the lawyers' new interpretations, saying that it would at least ease the pressure on Mr. Clinton to cut a major arms control deal with Moscow before he leaves office.</p>
        <p>But Senator Thad Cochran, a Mississippi Republican, saw the legal maneuvering as a political move by the administration to try to have it both ways.</p>
        <p>''I think he may have found a clever way to sidestep this whole issue,'' he said.</p>
