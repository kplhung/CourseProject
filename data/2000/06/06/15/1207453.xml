        <p>The elders of Court Street still talk fondly of the days when the biggest difference between the good guys and the bad guys was a government pension, when guys from opposite sides of the law were hardly averse to hoisting a few together on quiet afternoons or even elbowing up to the same lunch counter.</p>

        <p>The elders of Court Street still talk fondly of the days when the biggest difference between the good guys and the bad guys was a government pension, when guys from opposite sides of the law were hardly averse to hoisting a few together on quiet afternoons or even elbowing up to the same lunch counter.</p>
        <p>Sadly or not, those days are mostly gone, relics of a cozy law enforcement past. In today's tough-on-crime world, where a third felony can lead to a long stay in jail, the prosecutors and the people they are trying to put away are not only less likely to pal around together after work, they are less likely to have much fat in common to chew even if they did hang out.</p>
        <p>In Brooklyn Heights, the beating heart of Kings County's legal anatomy, the distance between white hats and black hats is perhaps most distinctly felt in what could be called ''A Tale of Two Diners.'' Separated by only a couple of leafy blocks of brownstones, the two lunch spots are a study in vastly different clienteles  -- the Park Plaza Diner catering to many folks who have been charged with crimes and the Clark Street Diner to many of those who do the charging.</p>
        <p>Harry Likourentzos, who has run the Park Plaza with his father, Peter, for 17 years, points out that his diner attracts not only criminal types but judges, lawyers and local politicians as well. But he admits that ''the defendants,'' as he cautiously calls them, are often the most amusing customers to serve. ''It's just kind of fun going home to watch the news and saying: 'Hey, I know that guy. I served him a cheeseburger today.' ''</p>
        <p>As the real estate agents like to say, it is all about location, and, indeed, the Park Plaza and the Clark Street are perfectly situated to attract their customers. The Plaza sits just a perp's walk away from the doors of the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse, while the Clark Street is around the corner from the United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York.</p>
        <p>The Plaza -- a boxy, brick construction with all the architectural elan of a rest stop Denny's -- has a long and distinguished history of feeding the borough's most infamous lawbreakers. The brothers Gotti -- Peter, Gene and John -- dined there at a back table during their numerous trials, as did Vincent Gigante, the former Genovese family boss. Just last May, Justin A. Volpe took meals at one of the Plaza's outsized tables in the days before pleading guilty to torturing Abner Louima.</p>
        <p>The Clark Street Diner, on the other hand, is an airy, eponymous storefront joint, which often serves as the noon redoubt for hungry prosecutors looking for a cheap and easy meal. During the lunchtime rush, its wooden booths and tables are packed with white-shirted G-man types discussing the federal penal code.</p>
        <p>But if the two restaurants attract different crowds, they are united, some say, in showing how things in the criminal justice community have slowly but surely changed.</p>
        <p>''In the old days, there was a sense of camaraderie between prosecutors, F.B.I. agents and defense attorneys, as if we were all in the same profession, just on different sides,'' said Ronald Fischetti, a defense lawyer. ''There was congeniality there in which you could share a meal and sometimes even war stories.''</p>
        <p>''But now,'' Mr. Fischetti continued, ''everything is completely different and never the twain shall meet. You don't want to be in the same lunchroom with prosecutors or agents discussing tactics anymore.''</p>
        <p>While several prosecutorial regulars at the Clark Street declined to comment on Mr. Fischetti's views, they were less reticent in singing the praises of their own particular hangout. To them, the Clark Street Diner, with its story-high glass front, not only boasts a terrific menu and quick, attentive service, but also feels like an extension of the court.</p>
        <p>''I started going to Clark Street because it's like the courthouse cafeteria,'' said Noah Perlman, an assistant United States attorney.</p>
        <p>''Clark Street's great,'' he went on to say. ''In addition to the fact that you can order everything under the sun, the waiters know you, they know your order, and you feel like a big shot in there.''</p>
