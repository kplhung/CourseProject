        <p>Strong dancers with vivid stage personalities made starring roles shine in two performances by American Ballet Theater at the Metropolitan Opera House.</p>
        <p>In ''Swan Lake'' on Monday night, when Ermanno Florio conducted, Amanda McKerrow portrayed the dual roles of the virtuous Odette, Queen of the Swans, and the villainous Odile. Ms. McKerrow was a delicate Odette whose flowing liquid movements suggested that this Swan Queen came from a realm of water and moonlight. Whereas her Odette often appeared to be shyly drawing inward, Ms. McKerrow made her steps grow sharper as Odile, especially in her glittering Black Swan pas de deux. Yet she never indulged in brassy exaggerations.</p>

        <p>Strong dancers with vivid stage personalities made starring roles shine in two performances by American Ballet Theater at the Metropolitan Opera House.</p>
        <p>In ''Swan Lake'' on Monday night, when Ermanno Florio conducted, Amanda McKerrow portrayed the dual roles of the virtuous Odette, Queen of the Swans, and the villainous Odile. Ms. McKerrow was a delicate Odette whose flowing liquid movements suggested that this Swan Queen came from a realm of water and moonlight. Whereas her Odette often appeared to be shyly drawing inward, Ms. McKerrow made her steps grow sharper as Odile, especially in her glittering Black Swan pas de deux. Yet she never indulged in brassy exaggerations.</p>
        <p>Angel Corella was the Prince Siegfried who found himself charmed by Odette and seduced by Odile. He was a high-spirited and impulsive prince whose leaps were signs of restlessness and enthusiasm. Yet the way he occasionally stood as if lost in thought suggested that this prince sensed the presence of mysterious powers and feelings he could not comprehend. Mr. Corella's prince was a young man about to grow up.</p>
        <p>On Saturday afternoon, Mr. Corella portrayed a decidedly grown-up fellow: Petruchio, the swaggering hero of John Cranko's ''Taming of the Shrew.'' And Julie Kent was the Katherina he tamed. They made a robustly comic pair.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kent stormed and kicked. Yet when she paused to fix her gaze on people, her piercing glances revealed that this shrew was shrewd and had no use for foolishness or pretension.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corella romped boisterously as Petruchio but took care to keep his antics from looking mean-spirited. Therefore it was only natural that Ms. Kent's Katherina should admire Petruchio's disdain of propriety. He, in turn, was fascinated by her sense of independence. And their struggles in their second-act duets ended appropriately with both characters smiling.</p>
        <p>David Briskin conducted.</p>
