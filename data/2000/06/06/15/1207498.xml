        <p>A few weeks ago, I was chased by a group of young men in broad daylight on my way to Prospect Park in Brooklyn. It was a Sunday afternoon, and I was headed to the park to go jogging. I'd just reached the corner of Seventh Avenue in Park Slope, a busy street,  when shouts and catcalls made me turn around. About 10 men were coming at me, one spraying toward my face with fluorescent canned string.</p>
        <p>After I told them to back off, they began following me, and one man yelled, ''Let's get her.'' Dizzy with adrenaline, I cut from the residential block that leads to the park into a pet store and hid behind the bags of dog food. When it seemed safe to come out, I turned around and went home, never making it to the park. I was physically unharmed, but something had changed: I felt suddenly vulnerable in my own neighborhood.</p>

        <p>A few weeks ago, I was chased by a group of young men in broad daylight on my way to Prospect Park in Brooklyn. It was a Sunday afternoon, and I was headed to the park to go jogging. I'd just reached the corner of Seventh Avenue in Park Slope, a busy street,  when shouts and catcalls made me turn around. About 10 men were coming at me, one spraying toward my face with fluorescent canned string.</p>
        <p>After I told them to back off, they began following me, and one man yelled, ''Let's get her.'' Dizzy with adrenaline, I cut from the residential block that leads to the park into a pet store and hid behind the bags of dog food. When it seemed safe to come out, I turned around and went home, never making it to the park. I was physically unharmed, but something had changed: I felt suddenly vulnerable in my own neighborhood.</p>
        <p>I understand how the women who were harassed and assaulted by a mob of men in Central Park on Sunday must feel. That such terrifying attacks could take place in daylight in Central Park, with people all around, utterly shakes our sense of safety.</p>
        <p>Women learn early which streets are safe to walk on, when it's safe to be there and even how to walk (hands wrapped around keys, eyes straight ahead). We accept that we must pay for our safety in the form of cabs and doorman buildings in more expensive neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Some women express their outrage in rallies like Take Back the Night, but these protests almost never go beyond college campuses and are too often mislabeled as militant or man-hating. Some try to learn to defend themselves, but self-defense classes can only go so far. Peyton Bryant, one of the women attacked in the park, is a kick-boxing instructor, yet was almost powerless against a mob of 15 or more men.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Bryant is well aware of the best line of long-term defense: publicity. When she got no help from police officers at the scene, she pursued reporters, getting on the evening news, National Public Radio and even Geraldo Rivera. If the attackers hadn't picked someone as savvy as Ms. Bryant, would we even be talking about this now?</p>
        <p>Sunday's marauding in Central Park is not an isolated incident, as my own experience shows. Think also of the ''whirlpooling'' in public pools a few summers ago, when girls were surrounded and groped, and of the sexual harassment that is a daily problem in our schools.</p>
        <p>All of us, men and women, must be firm in insisting that none of this is ever innocent or excusable. We shouldn't just now be discovering our outrage.</p>
