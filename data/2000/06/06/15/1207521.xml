        <p>Ever since the Cendant Corporation announced in April 1998 the ''accounting irregularities'' that would decimate its stock, Henry R. Silverman has been on a crusade to restore his reputation.</p>
        <p>As the deal maker who built HFS Inc., a huge franchiser of brands like Century 21, Ramada, Days Inns and Avis, Mr. Silverman was responsible for the merger with CUC International that created Cendant. So with the announcement, just months after he became chief executive of the combined company, it was not only a tremendous blow to Cendant's stock that suffered a tremendous blow. So did Mr. Silverman's standing as a pillar of the business world.</p>
        <p>Over the last two years, Mr. Silverman has taken a personal, as well as professional, interest in clearing his name. After embarking on a strenuous internal investigation, Mr. Silverman has cooperated extensively with regulators and been pointed in his contention that blame for this fraud lies elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''His reputation is very precious to him, and he wanted to clean it,'' said Frederick Kobrick, a Boston money manager who has invested in Cendant.</p>
        <p>This effort has pitted Mr. Silverman's credibility against that of Walter A. Forbes, the man who once headed CUC International. Mr. Forbes, who was originally positioned to run the combined company with Mr. Silverman but who resigned from Cendant in July 1998, has previously denied any knowledge of the accounting irregularities. Yesterday, his lawyer would not comment.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's events, in which three former senior managers pleaded guilty to criminal charges of fraud and the Securities and Exchange Commission brought charges against seven former managers, goes a long way in providing a measure of vindication for Mr. Silverman. The regulators contended that senior managers at CUC were responsible for falsifying earnings over more than a decade in a fraud that artificially lifted earnings by more than $500 million in its last three years.</p>
        <p>The announcement ''does definitely restore a large degree of Henry's excellent reputation as a builder of companies and shareholder value,'' said James Citrin,, an executive recruiter with SpencerStuart. ''It also justifies the aggressive stance that he took in dealing with it.''</p>
        <p>But analysts agree that Mr. Silverman's quest to restore his credibility and rebuild Cendant is not over. The accounting fraud that resulted from the merger with CUC ''will be the epitaph to Silverman's career,'' said Patrick McGurn, director of corporate programs for Institutional Shareholder Services, a company based in Rockville, Md., that advises large investors on proxy issues.</p>
        <p>In an interview yesterday, Mr. Silverman was quick to dismiss any suggestion that he might have -- or should have -- known about the fraud when the 1997 merger took place. ''I'm down $800 million,'' he said. ''I don't think the height of personal financial masochism could reach that level.''</p>
        <p>''This is very painful,'' he added, ''personally, professionally and financially.''</p>
        <p>The outline presented by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the fraud seems to dispel any notion that Mr. Silverman or other HFS managers were involved. ''It enhances credibility,'' said Michael Millman, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ''It makes him a more sympathetic actor in this sordid play.''</p>
        <p>Investors may be more likely to buy shares in the company now that the taint from the current management team has been removed, he said.</p>
        <p>Some Cendant investors may benefit from the company's pending $2.85 billion settlement of a shareholder class-action suit. Last December, Cendant also received a vote of confidence from John C. Malone and Liberty Media, which invested $400 million.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. painted a dark portrait of a concerted effort by CUC senior managers -- including the former chief financial officer, who said he was acting at the direction of his superiors -- to falsify earnings.</p>
        <p>''For more than 12 years, until its exposure in 1998, certain members of CUC's senior and middle management devised and operated a systemic, systematic scheme to inflate operating income at CUC. The scheme was driven by senior management's determination that CUC would always meet earnings expectations of Wall Street analysts and fueled by a disregard for any obligation that the earnings reported needed to be 'real,' '' the regulators said.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the regulators praised Cendant's management for its response to the discovery of accounting problems at CUC: ''Cendant management promptly reported the discovery of the fraud and its attendant accounting irregularities to the commission staff; conducted a thorough internal investigation and compiled an extensive report,'' the regulators said, adding that they also ''cooperated with staff in its investigation of this matter.''</p>
        <p>What is still subject to debate is whether Mr. Silverman should have known that CUC, the subject of lengthy accounting travails, might be a problematic purchase. ''For an executive who has built fame and fortune as a savvy deal maker,'' Mr. McGurn, the proxy adviser, said, ''to be snookered by fraudsters does beg the question of how good the due diligence was.''</p>
        <p>Still, argued Mr. Kobrick, the money manager, any such deliberate fraud would be practically impossible to detect. Regulators also acknowledged that if one co-conspirator had not come forward the extent of the fraud might not have been discovered for a long time.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Silverman's efforts to vindicate himself are clearly not over. Cendant is trying to force Mr. Forbes to return his $47 million severance package, the subject of legal proceedings. Earlier this month, Mr. Forbes paid back $2.3 million in travel and entertainment expenses, which Cendant had disputed. ''We intend to pursue that to a conclusion,'' a Cendant spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverman would not address the issue of whether he feels personally betrayed by Mr. Forbes. ''I think the court will be the instrument of retribution,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The company has also brought suit against Ernst &amp; Young, which Mr. Silverman has publicly argued neglected its responsibilities to uncover the fraud in its long history of auditing CUC. Ernst &amp; Young is also suing Cendant, arguing that its management misled them.</p>
        <p>All of this leaves Mr. Silverman with the continued task of rebuilding Cendant. The stock, which has been hurt in recent months by concerns about the economy and a slowing housing market, closed yesterday at $12.4375, still a far cry from its high of $41.69 just before the disclosure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverman has put Cendant through a wringer, shedding $4.5 billion of businesses not related to its central operations. ''It's clearly been a distraction for him and the company,'' said Greg Zappin, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's. ''It's caused them to radically change the business plans. The company's been in a holding pattern ever since.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kobrick, for one, said he thought yesterday's events provided a kind of coda to the story of the last two years. ''He's going to be the most focused guy in the world,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As for his own view, Mr. Silverman acknowledged the need to move on. ''We need closure,'' he said. ''This is the beginning of the end of closure.''</p>
