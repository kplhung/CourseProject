        <p>Clinton administration officials, trying to build on the progress of the Korean summit meeting, said tonight that they would announce within a week the lifting of a broad set of economic sanctions that have been in place against North Korea since it invaded the South 50 years ago this month.</p>
        <p>The end of these sanctions would allow North Korea, which is economically desperate, to export raw materials and goods to the United States and would open air and shipping routes between the two countries. American companies would be allowed to invest in agriculture, mining, roads, ports, travel and tourism in the North, though it is likely that far more Japanese and South Korean companies would try to do so.</p>

        <p>Clinton administration officials, trying to build on the progress of the Korean summit meeting, said tonight that they would announce within a week the lifting of a broad set of economic sanctions that have been in place against North Korea since it invaded the South 50 years ago this month.</p>
        <p>The end of these sanctions would allow North Korea, which is economically desperate, to export raw materials and goods to the United States and would open air and shipping routes between the two countries. American companies would be allowed to invest in agriculture, mining, roads, ports, travel and tourism in the North, though it is likely that far more Japanese and South Korean companies would try to do so.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration's decision to end sanctions -- a carrot that President Clinton dangled in front of the North last fall as part of a strategy formulated by former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry -- has limits. Prohibitions on the sale of high technology and ''dual-use goods'' -- those that could be used for both civilian and military purposes -- will remain in place as long as North Korea is still classified a terrorist state by the State Department, officials said. The United States is also required by law to oppose financing to terrorist countries from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</p>
        <p>But administration officials said today that they hoped the North might, in coming months, make concessions that would get it off the terrorist list.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Clinton cautiously referred to the agreement on the Korean peninsula as ''just the first step,'' but added, ''It's clearly a move in the right direction, and everyone else in the world should be encouraged.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps as striking as the imminent lifting of the sanctions is the administration's sudden change of tone about the North's mysterious leader, Kim Jong Il. Until recently, Mr. Kim was usually described by American officials as paranoid, a recluse, a kidnapper and a patron of European prostitutes. But this evening, one senior administration official went to some lengths to praise Mr. Kim and compare him to his South Korean counterpart, Kim Dae Jung.</p>
        <p>''We knew that Kim Dae Jung was courageous and a visionary,'' the official said. ''Kim Jong Il clearly has some of those qualities, and is displaying some vision himself.''</p>
        <p>That new approach to the North marks a big risk for the Clinton administration, especially if the accords reached today dissolve in bickering over the details.</p>
        <p>There is reason to worry about that: some of the concessions announced today, such as cultural exchanges and visits across the demilitarized zone by Koreans who have not seen family members for half a century, were the centerpieces of a 1991 agreement between the two nations that was never put into action.</p>
        <p>But the agreement today, officials noted, bears the imprimatur of both nation's leaders. And Kim Jong Il, they said, made a public about-face, inviting North Koreans to line the streets as he welcomed a South Korean leader that the North has regularly characterized as an evil lackey of the Americans.</p>
        <p>If the change in the North's attitude proves real, however, it creates a whole new set of questions for the United States. Would the United States be willing, over time, to withdraw some of the 37,000 American troops based in South Korea? Is it ready to resume diplomatic relations with the North, as it did five years ago with Vietnam?</p>
        <p>And how could the United States justify spending $60 billion on a missile defense system predicated partly on the threat of a nuclear attack from North Korea, if it believed the North was changing course?</p>
        <p>While the administration has gone to extraordinary lengths in the past two years to coax the North out of its shell, it is unready and unable to answer those questions.</p>
        <p>''The sticking point is the North's nuclear weapons and their missiles,'' said Donald Gregg, the former Central Intelligence Agency station chief and then American ambassador to Seoul. ''As soon as we raise those, they are going to raise the question of why we still have troops on the Korean peninsula. And no one is ready to deal with that.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''Kim Dae Jung very wisely went to Pyongyang with an agenda that deals with those issues that are within the control of South Korea and North Korea.'' Diplomats familiar with Kim Dae Jung's talking points say he went determined to raise the security issues, but only in an oblique way. South Korean officials say that Kim Dae Jung planned to tell Kim Jong Il that those issues needed to be resolved, but not to press specific ideas.</p>
        <p>''That may be the subject of the return visit to Seoul,'' one senior South Korean official said.</p>
        <p>North Korea watchers here -- from intelligence officials to State Department diplomats -- say that even if a new era of cooperation is dawning, there is little reason to believe that the agreement reached today heralds any imminent unification of the Korean peninsula.</p>
        <p>Neither side really wants that any time soon. The North's leaders have long been focused on survival -- keeping their regime together at any cost. Kim Jong Il appears to have concluded that his best chances of survival lie in milking South Korea and Japan for the aid and trade he needs to achieve that goal.</p>
        <p>And South Korea, for all its talk about the ultimate goal of reunifying the nation, knows that true reunification would cost a fortune. The billions spent propping up the country could endanger the South's recovery from the Asian economic crisis that threatened to ruin it two years ago. And it would dramatically change the country's social dynamics.</p>
        <p>''Unification is a national goal,'' one senior South Korean diplomat said earlier this year, ''and it should stay that way for a good while.''</p>
