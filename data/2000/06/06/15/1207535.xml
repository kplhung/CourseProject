        <p>A State Supreme Court judge yesterday reversed Gov. George E. Pataki's two-week-old order that shut down New York Apple Tours, whose double-decker buses have come under fierce criticism since one killed a pedestrian in Midtown last month. But city and state officials said they would appeal the ruling to keep the buses off the streets.</p>
        <p>In her ruling, Judge Phyllis Gangel-Jacob said Mr. Pataki's May 31 order pulling the vehicle registration for 63 Apple Tours buses raised due process questions, imposed a penalty that could kill the company and hurt the city's tourism industry. The ruling also overturned a city order, by a Department of Consumer Affairs administrative law judge, that revoked the company's operating license hours after Mr. Pataki's directive.</p>
        <p>Judge Gangel-Jacob appointed Ross Sandler, a professor at New York Law School and a former commissioner of the City Department of Transportation, to ensure that the company abided by city and state regulations. The judge's decision affects the state and city orders temporarily, until hearings are held for Apple Tours to defend itself properly.</p>
        <p>In unusually frank language, the judge said that allowing Apple Tours to operate, with safeguards, would ''not do any harm to any public interest.'' Allowing the city and state orders to remain, however, would irreparably harm Apple Tours, she said.</p>
        <p>''Putting N.Y.A.T. out of business is final and irrevocable,'' said Judge Gangel-Jacob, referring to the tour company by its initials. ''Putting more than 300 employees out of work with no warning at the height of the tourism season is certainly contrary to the public interest.''</p>
        <p>The judge went on to say that ''hundred, perhaps thousands, of summer tourists will be deprived of the opportunity to visit our diverse city'' if the company's buses are not rolling.</p>
        <p>Both the city and state said they would appeal the judge's decision by today, which could keep Apple Tours buses off the streets until a further court review. ''That appeal will result in an automatic stay,'' said Suzanne Morris, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki. ''The upside of that is it will keep the buses off the road.''</p>
        <p>But Michael D. Hess, the city corporation counsel, said that Apple Tours could appeal the stay and be back on the road if its appeal was upheld. He harshly criticized the judge's order, saying that it ignored the company's troubled history. Apple Tours, which was founded in 1991 by Harry Grant, a New Jersey developer, had for years been cited for a range of misdeeds, from fabricating customs records on imported buses to skirting environmental regulations to switching permits on buses to avoid inspection to operating an illegal garage in a residential neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''New York Apple has a history and culture of putting people in danger,'' Mr. Hess said. ''It is ironic that Judge Gangel-Jacob talks about trying to keep this company in business during the summer season so the tourists can have an additional way to see the city. It is not very effective if they are subjected to dangerous buses that they may be riding on.''</p>
        <p>Hayim Grant, Harry Grant's son and the president of the company, said that he did not know when the tour operator's distinctive red buses would be back on the road.</p>
        <p>''We're happy that justice is served, but we don't know what's going to happen,'' he said. ''The city and the state have a right to appeal, and we're not sure whether we'll be back in operation. We've been damaged millions of dollars by this action. We've also laid off, we've had to terminate, 350 employees, and we're not sure how many of them we're going to get back.''</p>
        <p>At 45th Street and Ninth Avenue, the corner where Randolph Walker, 71, an actor, was killed by an Apple Tours bus on May 22, several of the company's most vehement opponents gathered yesterday afternoon to assail the judge's ruling. ''We're here unfortunately and, by surprise, to express our outrage and our shock,'' said City Councilwoman Christine Quinn, who represents the neighborhood. ''New York Apple Tours will be back on our streets, something that will be an immediate danger to pedestrians and to tourists.''</p>
        <p>In her ruling, Judge Gangel-Jacob addressed those who have long complained about the company, wondering whether the effort to shut down Apple Tours was a ''not in my backyard'' reaction. ''We have become experts at expressing our discontent,'' the judge wrote.</p>
        <p>Judge Gangel-Jacob noted that the state revoked vehicle registrations for Apple Tours buses without giving the company a chance to make its case at a hearing. The ruling also said the tour operator had argued that it was not been given adequate time to prepare a defense in emergency hearings held in late May by the Department of Consumer Affairs. If given the chance to argue the merits of its case, Judge Gangel-Jacob said, the company would likely avoid a shut-down order.</p>
        <p>''It is unlikely that even as second offenders, in an industry fraught with regulation, closing down the business lock, stock and barrel will be the likely punishment,'' she said.</p>
