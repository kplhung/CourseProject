        <p>Responding quickly to the mounting furor over lax security at Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Senate today unanimously confirmed the long-stalled nomination of the first director of a new agency to oversee Los Alamos and the nation's other nuclear weapons laboratories.</p>
        <p>Gen. John Gordon, who has been serving as deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, was confirmed as the first administrator of the new National Nuclear Security Administration after Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, lifted a hold he had placed on the nomination last month.</p>

        <p>Responding quickly to the mounting furor over lax security at Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Senate today unanimously confirmed the long-stalled nomination of the first director of a new agency to oversee Los Alamos and the nation's other nuclear weapons laboratories.</p>
        <p>Gen. John Gordon, who has been serving as deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, was confirmed as the first administrator of the new National Nuclear Security Administration after Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, lifted a hold he had placed on the nomination last month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bryan, along with other congressional Democrats and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, had objected to the legislation creating the new agency, which they said would reduce the ability of the energy secretary to oversee the laboratories.</p>
        <p>But the news of the disappearance of two computer hard drives containing nuclear secrets from a vault at Los Alamos forced quick action.</p>
        <p>In fact, Congressional Republicans stepped up their attacks on Mr. Richardson today for what they said were  security failures that had occurred while he has led the department, and openly questioned whether he is up to the job. While they stopped short of calling for his resignation in the wake of the latest security breach at Los Alamos, several lawmakers came close.</p>
        <p>''It turns out that the guardian of our nuclear security here, Secretary Richardson wasn't minding the store,'' complained Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona.</p>
        <p>Senator Wayne Allard, Republican of Colorado, said at a Senate hearing: ''I seriously wonder if we don't have better security at our Wal-Mart stores than you do at Los Alamos Labs. Where's the accountability?''</p>
        <p>Six managers at Los Alamos have been placed on a paid leave of absence as a result of the latest security lapse, including the head of nuclear weapons programs, Stephen M. Younger, the highest-ranking official in the group.</p>
        <p>Among the others placed on leave by John C. Browne, the laboratory's director, was the head of the government's Nuclear Emergency Search Team, or NEST, which is responsible for responding to nuclear accidents and nuclear-related terrorist threats. The team leader's name was not immediately released. The missing hard drives belonged to the NEST.</p>
        <p>Among the others placed on leave were those identified as Carol Mangeng, deputy associate laboratory director for nuclear weapons, and Jon Weisheit, director the laboratory's X Division, which designs nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Younger first became prominent last year in the opening stages of the government's case against Wen Ho Lee, the scientist fired from Los Alamos and charged with mishandling classified material.</p>
        <p>Investigators discovered that Dr. Lee had downloaded vast amounts of classified material and copied it onto portable computer disks, some of which were missing. Dr. Lee was arrested in December, and at his initial bail hearings, Mr. Younger testified for the prosecution about the significance of the loss of the data.</p>
        <p>The hard drives that contained the nuclear data disappeared from the vault in the X Division. The hard drives, each about the size of a deck of cards, contained highly sensitive data needed by the NEST members to render nuclear devices safe in emergencies.</p>
        <p>In addition, the missing material included intelligence information, including some about the Russian nuclear weapons program.</p>
        <p>Two NEST members discovered the hard drives missing when they searched the vault on May 7 as a forest fire raged near the laboratory.  But there was a three-week delay before senior laboratory managers and Energy Department officials in Washington were notified.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Dr. Browne placed the six managers on leave, pending further disciplinary action, as a result of the three-week lag.</p>
        <p>Officials said today that the highest ranking official who knew immediately on May 7 that the hard drives were missing was the NEST leader.</p>
        <p>In extensive Congressional testimony today, Energy Department officials said that they had been able to confirm that the two hard drives  were safely in the vault as recently as April 7.</p>
        <p>A total of 86 NEST members had access to the vault and the data, including 26 who could go in and out of the vault without escorts. Those 26 are nuclear scientists who work regularly in the X Division. Dr. Browne acknowledged in Congressional testimony today that the 26 who did not require escorts had the ability to remove the hard drives without signing them out or leaving any record that they had taken the material.</p>
        <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation began polygraph examinations of NEST members today, but officials said it is too soon to determine any results from the exams.</p>
        <p>''My personal feeling is that one of those 86 people has information that they are not telling us,'' a government official said.</p>
        <p>Now that the matter has been turned over to the F.B.I., officials said that whoever was responsible, if caught, for the disappearance was likely to face criminal charges of mishandling classified information.</p>
        <p>Officials said that Dr. Browne went to the NEST members and other managers last week, and told them that it would be better to come forward immediately with any information they had, before it became a criminal matter.</p>
        <p>While he did not offer them immunity last week, he did make it clear that they would be much better off coming forward before the F.B.I. took over. But no one came forward, officials said.</p>
