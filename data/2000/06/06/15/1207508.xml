      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Senate did nothing on campaign finance today, except to use the issue to keep from doing almost anything else.</p>
        <p>First, a long-scheduled vote by the Rules Committee on campaign finance legislation was abruptly canceled on the grounds that committee members like Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and John W. Warner of Virginia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, were too important and too busy to make time for a meeting.</p>
        <p>But on the Senate floor, Mr. Lott and Mr. Warner were not dealing with the intricacies of a $309.8 billion defense authorization bill designed to get the Pentagon to modernize faster and more thoroughly, the legislation formally before the world's greatest deliberative body.</p>
        <p>Instead, they were involved in a discussion, visible but not audible from the gallery, about what amendment would come up next. The familiar campaign finance measure from Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, which would prohibit unregulated contributions known as soft money, was first in line as the official pending business.</p>
        <p>It would take unanimous consent to replace it with something else. But it takes unanimous consent to do almost anything in the Senate, and the order of amendments is often shuffled in moments of collegiality.</p>
        <p>The Republican leaders really do not want another debate and vote on the McCain-Feingold measure, but the other alternatives also displease at least some Republicans, too.</p>
        <p>Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, with Mr. Warner as co-sponsor, had a measure for a commission to ponder future relations with Cuba. The senators from Florida objected.</p>
        <p>Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, wanted to pass a broad law against hate crimes, including those based on sexual orientation. There was also a measure that actually had something to do with the Pentagon, a bill to allow servicewomen overseas to have abortions at base hospitals if they paid for them. All of those measures have Democratic sponsors, and have some Republican support.</p>
        <p>Each of those Democrats wanted to go first. But for each of those measures there was someone, usually a Republican, who said it should not come up, at least not now.</p>
        <p>This being the Senate, when no agreement could be reached on which of those amendments to bring up, 41 noncontroversial amendments were adopted in a matter of seconds and with no debate or even explanation of what they dealt with.</p>
        <p>The amendments adopted reflected a variety of pet projects, and would, for example, do the following:</p>
        <p>*Direct the Navy to paint and maintain some abandoned buildings in Cutler, Me., thanks to Senator Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine.</p>
        <p>*Allow the Greek government to sell a World War II LST (landing ship, tank) to some Navy veterans who want to make it into a floating museum, because of Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas.</p>
        <p>*Tell the Army to give an unneeded Army Reserve Center to Winona State University in Minnesota to use for student housing because of Senator Rod Grams, Republican of Minnesota.</p>
        <p>*Direct the Air Force to use donations to the Air Force Museum's Foundation to build a third building, dealing with the cold war, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, through the efforts of Senator Mike DeWine, Republican of Iowa.</p>
        <p>*Make servicemen and servicewomen overseas eligible for benefits under the Women, Infants and Children program on the same terms as their stateside counterparts, because of the efforts of Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa.</p>
        <p>*Tell the Pentagon to ship some M-1 rifles of World War II vintage to veterans' groups to use at funerals, a measure from Senator Warner.</p>
        <p>And then, by unanimous consent, the Senate put aside the national defense, at least for a day. It started talking about spending on transportation. Under the rules, legislative amendments such as those hanging over the defense bill cannot be added to spending bills.</p>
        <p>The campaign finance bill that the Rules Committee did not consider would have set limits on soft money contributions but not banned them. Written by Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, it has some Democratic support. But Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who heads both the Rules Committee and the Republicans' Senate Campaign Committee, insisted there was no time for amendments. When Democrats declined to vote on the bill without amendments, he called off the meeting.</p>
        <p>Senator Hagel said the turn of events did not discourage him. He said there were other ways to get the bill on the Senate calendar besides having the committee vote on it. But, asked if he was confident his bill would ever be voted on, he said: ''No, I'm not confident at all. But who knows?''</p>
        <p>Senator Dodd was less cheerful. He said today's proceedings were ''reflective of what has been going on for weeks,'' adding: ''We are just not doing anything. We can't bring up anything the majority doesn't want to talk about.''</p>
