        <p>In the stretch at the International Team Trials in Memphis, which ended Monday night after nine days, the cognoscenti were confused. ''It's over,'' they said. ''No, it's not.'' ''Yes, it is.''</p>
        <p>With 15 deals remaining, George Jacobs, Ralph Katz, Howard Weinstein, Steve Garner, all from the Chicago area, David Berkowitz of Old Tappan, N.J., and Larry Cohen of Boca Raton, Fla., led by the overwhelming margin of 68 imps. But their opponents, Richard Schwartz, Drew Casen, Steve Weinstein, Bobby Levin, Zia Mahmood and Michael Rosenberg, fought furiously and cut the margin in half in the first four deals. An impossible task now looked possible. If the trend continued, it could be the greatest comeback in the history of the game.</p>

        <p>In the stretch at the International Team Trials in Memphis, which ended Monday night after nine days, the cognoscenti were confused. ''It's over,'' they said. ''No, it's not.'' ''Yes, it is.''</p>
        <p>With 15 deals remaining, George Jacobs, Ralph Katz, Howard Weinstein, Steve Garner, all from the Chicago area, David Berkowitz of Old Tappan, N.J., and Larry Cohen of Boca Raton, Fla., led by the overwhelming margin of 68 imps. But their opponents, Richard Schwartz, Drew Casen, Steve Weinstein, Bobby Levin, Zia Mahmood and Michael Rosenberg, fought furiously and cut the margin in half in the first four deals. An impossible task now looked possible. If the trend continued, it could be the greatest comeback in the history of the game.</p>
        <p>But the Jacobs players righted their sinking ship and held on to win by 25. They will now represent the United States in the World Team Olympiad in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in August. The chief opposition is expected to come from Western Europe, particularly Italy, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Poland, Brazil and China are also likely to be in contention.</p>
        <p>The diagramed deal, which helped the Jacobs team build its early lead, provided a strong candidate for the best opening lead of the year. Howard Weinstein, as West, heard his opponents bid to four hearts after his partner had made a weak jump overcall in diamonds.</p>
        <p>Since North had shown strong slam interest, it was unlikely that a pedestrian diamond lead would produce four tricks for the defense. In such situations a small miracle is needed, and Weinstein decided that his best chance, admittedly a slim one, was to find his partner with a void in clubs.</p>
        <p>Having reasoned on these lines, one might expect the lead of the club queen. That would indeed have allowed East to score a ruff, but it would not necessarily have beaten the contract. After East ruffed one of dummy's high honors, he would have to shift to a diamond, not a spade. A spade shift would allow South to take his ace, draw trumps, and lead a club toward the dummy. He could then establish a club winner in time for a crucial diamond discard.</p>
        <p>Instead Weinstein led the club four, which deceived the declarer, Rosenberg. He naturally played the ace, and was shaken to see a trump appear from Garner on his right. West's club honor strength was preserved, and this was vital. A spade was returned by East, and there was no way for the declarer to recover. He could have taken the ace and drawn trumps, but he would eventually have lost a trick in each side suit as well as the opening ruff. In desperation he played low and was defeated when West produced the king and led the club queen. This was covered by the king and East scored a second ruff.</p>
        <p>South was able to draw trumps and eventually maneuver a diamond discard on the spade ace. But he was down one, losing a trick in each black suit as well as two ruffs.</p>
        <p>The replay was equally fascinating, and will be described in this column on Saturday. If Howard Weinstein and his teammates perform on the same level in Maastricht, they will surely win their first world titles.</p>
