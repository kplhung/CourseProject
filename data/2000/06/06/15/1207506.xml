        <p>Top executives of the New York Life Insurance Company were accused in a racketeering lawsuit yesterday of enriching themselves by charging tens of millions of dollars in excess fees to the retirement plans that the insurer maintains for its workers and agents.</p>
        <p>Officials of the company, which was also sued, denied the accusations and said they were confident that they would prevail in court.</p>
        <p>The civil case, filed in United States District Court in Philadelphia, seeks the return of special bonuses paid to the executives and the return of hundreds of millions of dollars in profit that New York Life made by charging the pension plans as much as 25 times the market rate for investment management services.</p>
        <p>The action is the latest in a growing number of suits brought by Eli Gottesdiener of the law firm of Sprenger &amp; Lang, which has offices in Minneapolis and Washington. The suits accuse companies of improperly manipulating retirement plans, which by law must be operated ''solely and exclusively'' for the benefit of workers and retirees. Earlier, the law firm sued the First Union Corporation and SBC Communications, the nation's largest local phone company, over their 401(k) plans.</p>
        <p>The New York Life suit was filed on behalf of the retirement plans and James A. Mehling, former president of a New York Life investment unit, Monitor Capital Advisors, who said he was fired in March 1999 after uncovering the scheme described in the suit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehling, in an interview, said that until he complained, and fees were reduced, the retirement plans were charged 50 cents for every $100 invested in an index fund. The fees, he said, though lowered, were still far above the competitive rate of as little as 2 cents for each $100.</p>
        <p>The suit accuses the executives of using the retirement money to set up the Mainstay family of mutual funds that New York Life began selling early in the 1990's. The retirement money makes up half of Mainstay's assets and has made up as much as 90 percent of some of its funds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehling, 50, of Buckingham, Pa., said, ''I was fired because I blew the whistle and told them they had a scheme to strip money out of the pension plan.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehling consistently exceeded profit goals for Monitor Capital Advisors and just six days before he was fired, he received a raise, a $147,000 bonus and a glowing review from Seymour Sternberg, chief executive of New York Life, one of the nation's largest life insurance companies.</p>
        <p>The suit contends that the pension, 401(k) and early retirement funds maintained for New York Life employees and agents would have hundreds of millions of dollars more in them today if not for the excessive fees. The five funds total $4.1 billion.</p>
        <p>One New York Life executive named in the suit, George J. Trapp, an executive vice president, said no wrongdoing had taken place, that all fees were in line with industry averages, that New York Life absorbed all record-keeping costs and that no executives benefited financially from the fees charged to the plans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trapp said that the suit was based on misinformation Mr. Mehling had supplied to his lawyers and that ''we were on very solid ground'' in dismissing Mr. Mehling for reasons that had nothing to do with his contention that he uncovered a scheme to siphon money from the plans. ''It is a novel theory,'' Mr. Trapp added, ''that the way to keep someone quiet is to terminate them and set them loose.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Trapp and Stephen M. Saxon of the Groom Group, a pension law firm in Washington that is representing New York Life, said that even if excess fees had been charged, they could not imagine a cause of action against the company because the defined-benefit pension plans have a surplus of $900 million above the $1.8 billion in benefits owed to employees and agents.</p>
        <p>In a defined-benefit plan, the employer assumes all investment risks for promising to pay a pension based on pay and years on the job.</p>
        <p>The law allows financial services companies like New York Life to invest pension assets in their own products, provided the fees charged are reasonable.</p>
        <p>Senior Labor Department officials said the law was clear that excessive fees are prohibited and that the financial health of a pension plan was irrelevant to whether this fiduciary duty had been violated.</p>
        <p>Norman Stein, a law professor at the University of Alabama who specializes in pension issues, said that ''the statute says you can't violate your duty and charge excessive fees, not that you can charge excessive fees if a pension plan is overfunded.''</p>
        <p>Alan Lebowitz, a senior Labor Department pension official, said he was not surprised that such a case had been filed. ''These cases were inevitable,'' he said, ''because the statute creates this situation where you can be'' an official of both an investment company and its pension plan. ''The individual who is both a plan fiduciary and a company official is in a very difficult situation because you clearly owe an obligation to both the plan participants and to the shareholders.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lebowitz said ''this case is very interesting in terms of getting some guidance from the courts'' on the ''balance between the duties to the plan and to the corporation.''</p>
