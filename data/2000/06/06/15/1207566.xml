        <p>Ray Fisher letter on buying toy cell phone and using it to show noisy talkers just how rude they are (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The constant rudeness of cell phone users who speak loudly and incessantly while riding on public transportation has always annoyed me (''No, I'm Not Talking to You,'' June 8). The other day in a 99-cent bargain shop, I saw a toy cell phone that looked very real. I purchased it to use for ridiculing these rude cell phone users. Now when I am on a bus and someone starts talking loudly using their cell phone, I take out my toy phone, press the button that makes it ring, place it to my ear as if to listen to a caller and then pass the toy phone to the stranger, who is talking away, and say: ''This is for you. Your line is busy.''</p>

        <p>The person usually looks puzzled, then realizes how inconsiderate he or she has been and hangs up the phone amid smiles from the other bus riders.</p>
