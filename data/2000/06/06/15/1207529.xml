        <p>The national anthem had just ended yesterday. The Yankees' fielders were in position. The umpires were ready to go. The mound was deserted, however, and several minutes would pass before Roger Clemens jogged out of the home dugout to pitch the first inning.</p>
        <p>But this was not about Clemens having a bad sense of timing. He had strained his right groin and needed extra wrapping and an adjustment in his mechanics to get through the first inning against the Boston Red Sox.</p>
        <p>He did not come out for the second inning, and the Yankees intend to place Clemens on the 15-day disabled list. The reliever Darrell Einertson will be promoted from Class AAA Columbus to assume Clemens's spot on the roster temporarily.</p>
        <p>Jake Westbrook, one of the pitchers acquired from the Montreal Expos for Hideki Irabu in December, will be promoted from Columbus before Saturday's game and will take Clemens's place in the rotation.</p>
        <p>''It's a little disappointing,'' Clemens said, typically understated, after the Yankees beat the Red Sox, 2-1.</p>
        <p>The Yankees do not really have any idea whether Clemens, who is 4-6 with a 4.76 earned run average, will recover by the time he is eligible to come off the disabled list on June 30. He could be out longer than that, perhaps until the All-Star Game.</p>
        <p>Clemens's status could have an impact on the Yankees' trade discussions. The prevailing sentiment of some club officials, even before Clemens was hurt, was that the team would benefit from adding a pitcher more so than a hitter.</p>
        <p>It figures that whenever the talks for the Cubs' Sammy Sosa intensify -- Chicago has not made a specific proposal -- the Yankees would at least explore the idea of having a pitcher like Ismael Valdes added to the deal.</p>
        <p>When talking with the Detroit Tigers about Juan Gonzalez, the Yankees will inquire about Hideo Nomo, who has pitched effectively for Detroit and has an affordable contract option of $5.5 million for next year.</p>
        <p>If Clemens is out, David Cone said, ''that's a big loss.''</p>
        <p>''We've both talked about how we've got to turn it up a notch,'' Cone said.</p>
        <p>Clemens said he first began feeling weakness in his groin while pitching in Atlanta on June 3, something that nagged at him when he pushed through his delivery with his right leg, when his right foot came up at the end of his delivery. Clemens indicated that he must have had some sort of a ''fraying,'' because there had been some discoloration, indicating signs of minor bleeding.</p>
        <p>Nearing the end of his pregame warm-up yesterday, Clemens felt something strain and immediately stopped throwing in the bullpen; he figured that if the injury was wrapped tightly enough and he pitched more upright -- ''more with my arm,'' he said -- then he could get through.</p>
        <p>It was evident that something was amiss, however. After throwing 8 of his first 10 pitches for strikes, Clemens started having difficulty keeping the ball down in the strike zone, throwing 11 of 13 pitches for balls and walking consecutive batters. He held the Red Sox scoreless, getting a couple of pop-ups, but Manager Joe Torre and the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre decided to not let him pitch the second inning.</p>
        <p>''He was trying to protect it, and it hurt badly,'' Torre said. ''He had two good workdays and Mel worked him really hard, and we thought he would be O.K.''</p>
        <p>Westbrook, 22, had never pitched higher than Class AA before this year. A first-round draft pick of the Colorado Rockies in 1996, Westbrook was traded to Montreal for Mike Lansing after the 1997 season, then swapped to the Yankees six months ago. He throws a hard-sinking fastball and impressed Torre in spring training with his aggressiveness and his ability to throw strikes, but he will be learning on the job.</p>
        <p>Westbrook was 5-6 with a 4.92 E.R.A. for Columbus, allowing 73 hits and 29 walks in 71 1/3 innings over 12 starts. The right-hander has thrown well in his last couple of starts, beating Norfolk on June 8 while giving up three runs in seven and one-third innings.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had hoped Ed Yarnall would be part of their rotation, but he pitched terribly in spring training and missed most of the last month because of a muscle strain.</p>
        <p>Torre said repeatedly during spring training that his biggest concern was the fact that his staff contained two 37-year-old starting pitchers, Clemens and Cone. Only one team in history has had two nonknuckleball pitchers 37 or older make 30 starts apiece: the 1984 Phillies, with Steve Carlton and Jerry Koosman. Cone has 12 starts, Clemens 15, and it appears that Clemens won't reach 30 this year.</p>
