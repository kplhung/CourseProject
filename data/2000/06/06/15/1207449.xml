        <p>The Bronx Democratic organization, which had put a slate of candidates in place for the September primary, was dealt a blow yesterday when one candidate withdrew from the plan crafted by Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the borough's Democratic Party chairman.</p>

        <p>The Bronx Democratic organization, which had put a slate of candidates in place for the September primary, was dealt a blow yesterday when one candidate withdrew from the plan crafted by Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the borough's Democratic Party chairman.</p>
        <p>The candidate, Joey Jackson, a lawyer who is chairman of the Bronx Democratic County Committee, said he would run for the State Assembly instead of seeking the lower position of Democratic district leader. That move will place him in direct competition with another candidate, Carl E. Heastie, whom Mr. Ramirez had backed for the Assembly seat.</p>
        <p>The decision by Mr. Jackson, a 33-year-old protege of Mr. Ramirez, is likely to produce a hotly contested race in the 83rd Assembly District between him and the 32-year-old Mr. Heastie, two candidates who Mr. Ramirez has sought to groom for leadership positions in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>A week ago, Mr. Ramirez had pieced together an agreement between various politicians in the Bronx under which the Democratic leader withdrew his support for the United States Representative, Eliot L. Engel. Instead, Mr. Ramirez took the unusual step of endorsing an insurgent candidate for Congress, State Senator Larry B. Seabrook.</p>
        <p>Under that arrangement, Assemblyman Samuel Bea had decided to run for the State Senate seat being vacated by Mr. Seabrook. And Mr. Heastie, a Democratic state committeeman and protege of Mr. Seabrook, was being supported in a run for the Assembly seat now held by Mr. Bea.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the year, Mr. Jackson had decided to run for the State Senate seat being vacated by Mr. Seabrook, but was persuaded in the last two weeks to accept Mr. Ramirez's offer of support for the position of district leader with the promise of support for a future opening in the City Council or the State Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson said he had deliberated for several days on the arrangement and decided, after meeting with residents of the district, to back out of it. ''The community approached me and urged me to run and told me that it was the right thing to do,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''I had to make choices on what was best for the community.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Heastie said the prospect of a race against Mr. Jackson would not change the tenacity of his campaign. ''This just means that I have to get my message out to the people,'' said Mr. Heastie, a budget analyst in the office of the city comptroller. ''But that is what I intended to do, whether I had an opponent or not.''</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mr. Ramirez reiterated his support for Mr. Heastie and noted that Mr. Jackson had, a few days earlier, embraced the candidacies of Mr. Seabrook and Mr. Heastie. At the same time, the Democratic chairman said: ''I recognize Mr. Jackson's right to run for any office. I wish him well and look forward to a great campaign.''</p>
