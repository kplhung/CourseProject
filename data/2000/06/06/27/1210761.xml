        <p>The Hudson River Valley, with its lush views and rich cultural landscape, has become one of the most endangered historic sites in the country because of encroaching development by electrical utilities and other industries, the nation's largest privately run preservation group warned today.</p>
        <p>The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit group based in Washington, chose the verdant, 125-mile stretch from New York City to Albany for its annual list of most endangered places for the first time since it began compiling it in 1988.</p>
        <p>''It was the fact that there was such a large threat,'' said Richard Moe, president of the trust. ''This could amount to a reindustrialization of the Hudson Valley and undo a lot of the progress that has been made if development isn't checked.''</p>
        <p>A total of 11 historic sites -- the Hudson Valley was the only major one named in the New York region -- were chosen for this year's list, culled from more than 100 nominated by environmentalists and local government officials for the dubious distinction. Sites on previous lists have included Governors Island in 1998 and Ellis Island in 1997.</p>
        <p>The preservation group said today that several proposed power plants, along with growing suburban sprawl along the Hudson River, threatened to pockmark the serene landscape made famous by the 19th-century painters of the Hudson River School.</p>
        <p>A power plant in Athens, for instance, would tower over Olana, the home of the painter Frederic Edwin Church. And a Wal-Mart superstore has been proposed not once but twice for a site across from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's home in Hyde Park.</p>
        <p>Over the last year, the Hudson Valley has been swept up in a rush to build power plants throughout the Northeast, fueled by the deregulation of electrical utilities and a growing demand for power plants. Gov. George E. Pataki approved plans this month for the $500 million plant in Athens, over the objections of many residents.</p>
        <p>Another half-dozen power plants have been proposed for the region in the next few years, as well as a growing number of superstores and several factories, including a $300 million cement plant in Greenport.</p>
        <p>While some environmentalists and advocacy groups have opposed these projects, Mr. Pataki and many business leaders have argued that development will bring much-needed economic relief to a region that has been struggling since the 1960's.</p>
        <p>Edward Reinfurt, vice president of the influential Business Council of New York State, a lobbying group that represents 5,000 companies, dismissed the suggestion that the Hudson Valley has become endangered.</p>
        <p>''In our minds, industry is indeed part of the heritage of the Hudson Valley, and quite frankly, we're delighted to see the return of the steel cranes in Albany and elsewhere,'' he said. ''There is a modest growth, but certainly not growth that threatens, in any way, our communities.''</p>
        <p>Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, said the governor has worked to protect the natural resources of the Hudson Valley at the same time that he has pushed economic development. For instance, he said, the state has spent more than $256 million to clean and protect the Hudson River since Mr. Pataki took office in 1995.</p>
        <p>''I don't think anyone has done more to protect open spaces and to enhance the Hudson River and its estuaries than Governor Pataki,'' Mr. McKeon said. ''He has a very personal and passionate commitment to the Hudson Valley.''</p>
        <p>But, he added, ''At the same time, we're trying to ensure that we have jobs here at home so our kids don't have to move out of the state.''</p>
        <p>In January, Mr. McKeon said, the governor appointed a task force of government and environmental leaders to study development issues in the valley and elsewhere around the state. But several environmentalists and advocacy groups said today that the state had not done enough to limit development along the river.</p>
        <p>''Our farmland is being consumed at an alarming rate, urban sprawl is moving up the Hudson like a wave, and big-box retail stores are being built on the outskirts of towns and sapping the vitality of our villages and urban centers,'' said Ned Sullivan, executive director of Scenic Hudson, an advocacy group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan's group was part of a coalition of environmental and citizens groups that filled out a 20-page application nominating the Hudson River Valley as an endangered historic site. Although the designation does not bring money, it does bring renewed public attention to the issue of overdevelopment.</p>
        <p>''It has been an effective tool,'' said Mr. Moe, of the preservation trust, which operates three historic sites in New York, including the Rockefeller estate at Pocantico Hills and the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in New York City. ''It's an educational vehicle to make people aware of the threats to different kinds of historic places. It almost always brings favorable attention and resources along with it.''</p>
