        <p>Francis Sellers Collins, an articulate medical geneticist, directs the National Human Genome Research Institute, a part of the National Institutes of Health, and is the most visible public spokesman for the human genome project.</p>
        <p>Born in Staunton, Va., on April 14, 1950, Dr. Collins was trained as a physical chemist at the University of Virginia and at Yale. But later in his career he adopted two important new interests: medical genetics and Christianity, a faith he discusses with more ease than many scientists. The genome project has filled him with awe, he has said, as it revealed something only God knew before.</p>
        <p>After obtaining an M.D. at the University of North Carolina, he and colleagues discovered the genes causing cystic fibrosis, neurofibromatosis and Huntington's disease.</p>
        <p>In 1993 he succeeded Dr. James D. Watson as director of the National Institutes of Health's part of the human genome project. He has skillfully managed the unwieldy alliance that he inherited.</p>
        <p>Dr. Collins's office finances the academic centers involved in the Human Genome Project, notably those of Washington University in St. Louis, the Whitehead Institute in Boston, and the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. But a rival government agency, the Department of Energy, has a piece of the action, and Dr. Collins has also had to coordinate policy with the Wellcome Trust of London, which finances one-third of the genome and has not hesitated to lobby for its own positions.</p>
        <p>Once the Celera Corporation appeared on the scene, critics said that an assortment of academic centers was ill-suited to the industrial-scale task of decoding the genome. But Dr. Collins has overseen a vigorous response to the Celera challenge. He focused resources on his three most successful centers and squashed a bid by the Department of Energy to collaborate with Celera.</p>
        <p>He coordinated his far-flung team in two groups: the G5 inner circle, which included the three leading N.I.H. centers, the Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute and the Sanger Center in England; and the G16 group, which included centers from Germany to China.</p>
        <p>Large-scale sequencing of DNA is a new art that the consortium learned by doing it. Dr. Collins persuaded the centers to cooperate in an effort to sequence 90 percent of the human genome by this month. By achieving that goal on schedule, he has assured that public consortium deserves a large share of the credit.</p>
        <p>''It was my role to serve as project manager and identify areas of difficulty, and mostly that is what I've done for the last year,'' he said last week.</p>
        <p>Players on Consortium Team: Scientists Turned Cartographers</p>
        <p>ROBERT H. WATERSTON</p>
        <p>A physician interested in muscle disease, Robert Waterston, 56, was persuaded to study muscle disorders in the C. elegans worm, then being established as a laboratory animal by biologists in Cambridge, England. Dr. Waterston then became drawn into the project of decoding the worm's genome. As director of the genome sequencing center at Washington University in St. Louis, he and his English colleague Dr. John E. Sulston decoded the worm's genome in December 1998; it was the first animal genome to be sequenced.</p>
        <p>Building on these methods, Dr. Waterston's center became the spearhead of the National Institutes of Health's attack on the human genome.</p>
        <p>Looking back, he wondered if with an earlier start the consortium might not have done even more. ''John and I,'' he said last week, referring to Dr. Sulston, ''were on record in 1994 as trying to push things and saying the time was at hand. The people close to the field saw it could be done and were impatient.''</p>
        <p>JOHN E. SULSTON</p>
        <p>Dr. John Sulston, 58, is a biologist who directs the Sanger Center, near Cambridge, England, which is the National Institutes of Health's major partner in the Human Genome Project. Financed by the Wellcome Trust of London, the center has decoded one-third of the human genome.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sulston is well known for having traced every cell in the C. elegans roundworm, now a standard laboratory organism, from the single cell of the egg to the 959 cells of the adult worm, a 10-year tour de force of assiduous microscope work.</p>
        <p>As part of his interest in the worm, Dr. Sulston began to decode its DNA. The task, undertaken with Dr. Robert H. Waterston of Washington University in St. Louis, became a pilot project for the human genome.</p>
        <p>Within the community of worm biologists, Dr. Sulston championed the view that knowledge and research tools should be free to all, an ethos he carried over to the Human Genome Project. He and Dr. Waterston, as well as the rest of the consortium scientists, decided to release their genome data nightly as a gift to the world's researchers.</p>
        <p>RICHARD A. GIBBS</p>
        <p>Born in Australia, Dr. Richard Gibbs, 42, is director of the sequencing center at the Baylor College of Medicine, the smallest of the big three centers.</p>
        <p>He was drawn into DNA sequencing through an interest in technology. ''It was apparent to me that technical advances could increase our understanding and help answer very profound and simple questions, like why are we different to chimps?'' he said.</p>
        <p>But DNA sequencing is a demanding process. ''To be a scientist you have got to love it, because at a certain level you would be disappointed so much of the time,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''You have got to love the unpeeling of knowledge; otherwise it is very difficult to stick with it.''</p>
        <p>ELBERT BRANSCOMB</p>
        <p>Dr. Elbert Branscomb, 65, directs the Joint Genome Center at the Department of Energy, under the supervision of Dr. Ari Patrinos, the associate director for biology. The department's human genome project began as an outgrowth of its interest in radiation biology.</p>
        <p>ERIC S. LANDER</p>
        <p>Trained as a mathematician, Dr. Eric Lander, 43, became interested in biology, and with the help of a MacArthur award switched to the study of human disease genes. This interest led to involvement in genome sequencing. Dr. Lander is now director of the genome sequencing center at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
        <p>An early mathematical interest in the number 17 seems to have come full circle as Chromosome 17 was among those Dr. Lander's center was assigned.</p>
        <p>From his interest in human biological variation, Dr. Lander has worked with Affymetrix, a maker of DNA chips, to develop a device that would scan a patient's genes, pinpointing those that differed from the consensus human sequence and that might make their owner prone to certain diseases.</p>
