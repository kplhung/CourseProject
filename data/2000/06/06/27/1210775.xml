        <p>For the second time in less than a week, the House turned back an effort to scuttle an agreement between the Clinton administration and Smith &amp; Wesson on marketing and safety measures.</p>
        <p>By a vote of 201 to 196, the House defeated a measure by Representative John Hostettler, Republican of Indiana, that would have prevented the Justice Department from spending any money to implement or enforce the agreement.</p>
        <p>Smith &amp; Wesson and the administration are at odds on just what the agreement means.</p>
        <p>The vote was virtually a mirror image of the tally last Wednesday when the House voted down another amendment, also sponsored by Mr. Hostettler, that would have barred the Department of Housing and Urban Development from spending any money to carry out the agreement.</p>
        <p>''This is not gun control,'' said Representative Carolyn B. McCarthy, a Long Island Democrat who spoke out against the amendment and in support of the agreement. ''This is gun safety where a manufacturer comes before us and says it will do what it can to make our communities safer.''</p>
        <p>Today's action is the latest twist in the effort by the Clinton administration to break the solid wall of opposition to gun control by the nation's gun manufacturers.</p>
        <p>In March the administration announced that it had reached an agreement with Smith &amp; Wesson, the country's oldest and largest maker of firearms and a unit of Tomkins P.L.C. of London. In return for entering into the agreement, the administration and several cities agreed to drop their lawsuits against Smith &amp; Wesson.</p>
        <p>Among other things, the accord commits the company to placing a second serial number that would be hidden on all new guns in order to make it harder for criminals to scratch off a gun's identifying number.</p>
        <p>In addition, Smith &amp; Wesson agreed to provide all new guns with trigger locks and to promise to use 2 per cent of its revenues to developing so-called smart-gun technology that would allow a weapon to be fired only by its owner.</p>
        <p>Among the more contentious parts of the agreement was the requirement that all Smith &amp; Wesson-certified dealers make buyers wait 14 days before buying a second handgun, and the promise, administration officials say, by Smith &amp; Wesson not to sell any firearms at gun shows where background checks of buyers are not conducted.</p>
        <p>In the weeks after the agreement, however, the administration and Smith &amp; Wesson diverged in their interpretation of this critical provision.</p>
        <p>Administration officials contend that the agreement barred the company from selling firearms at shows where sellers -- whether they are employed by Smith &amp; Wesson or not -- do not conduct checks into buyers' background.</p>
        <p>Smith &amp; Wesson officials contend that the provision applies only to gun shows where Smith &amp; Wesson employees do not conduct background checks.</p>
        <p>Should Mr. Hostettler's amendment have passed and should Smith &amp; Wesson and the administration fail to resolve the differing interpretations, the Justice Department would have been banned from going into court to force the Springfield, Mass., company to comply with the administration's interpretation of the accord.</p>
