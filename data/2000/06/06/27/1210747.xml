        <p>THE greatest baseball team of the 20th century and all time, as the New York Yankees have often been called the last two championship seasons, is suddenly running scared of the Toronto Blue Jays and a couple of small-market teams with cut-rate payrolls.</p>

        <p>THE greatest baseball team of the 20th century and all time, as the New York Yankees have often been called the last two championship seasons, is suddenly running scared of the Toronto Blue Jays and a couple of small-market teams with cut-rate payrolls.</p>
        <p>It has taken less than half a season for an organization that methodically won the World Series three of the last four years to shudder at the possibility of competing for its rightful place in the playoffs against teams from that former Class AAA outpost, the American League West.</p>
        <p>How pathetically unbecoming for a team with the Yankees' pride and pedigree to be portrayed as shouting from a rooftop for someone to come save them from the White Sox, from David Wells, from the Junior-less Mariners and the financially challenged A's, who two summers ago considered Rickey Henderson their most productive player and, gulp, veteran leader. Don't look now, Boss, but your homeys from Tampa are only eight and one-half games behind you.</p>
        <p>Just as it's become apparent that the Yankees may have to sweat to survive September, the city chorus has taken up George Steinbrenner's ''do-something'' cue and begun calling for the kind of acquisition that won't mean anything unless the pitching gets straightened out.</p>
        <p>If what we have seen from David Cone and Roger Clemens is all there is, then the Yankees should save those young prospects for the pitchers' sale that is sure to come. Otherwise, it will soon be the 1980's all over again, when pitching was as rare as parking, and Steinbrenner will be starting his new television network with a $120 million payroll and the Bronx chapter of the Cleveland Indians as his main attraction.</p>
        <p>Until this all works itself out, Yankee fans should sit back and enjoy, for a change, some regular-season ballgames that, you know, mean something. They're in Detroit this week and Tampa this weekend and their mission, though paling compared with Tom Cruise's, is to put some distance between themselves and .500.</p>
        <p>People around New York can't seem to believe the Yankees are in this unenviable position so close to the -- gasp! -- All-Star break. Out of first place. Out of the playoffs, if they were to begin today.</p>
        <p>It should be a cause for celebration that there is new blood flowing in the American League, not an excuse to spend another $20 million and further distort the imbalance that already exists between big and small markets. Remember this: when the Braves were beset with injuries last year, they toughed them out, and played inspiring ball down the stretch.</p>
        <p>Over the last four years, how many regular-season series weren't just showcases for a team already penciled into a division title or the wild-card berth? As wonderful a team as the Yankees have been, the Mets reminded us last year that the regular-season struggle is still what makes baseball great, and what separates it from the other team sports. It can't be coincidence that the more the regular season has become a formality, the more World Series ratings have declined.</p>
        <p>If Yankee fans believe this team should not have to actually scratch and claw anymore during the regular season, then they are as spoiled and unrealistic as the owner. Steinbrenner has a payroll that exceeds $90 million. For that kind of investment, they are apparently supposed to settle the issue of the postseason by late May and allow Joe Torre to work on his October rotation for the next four months.</p>
        <p>Except it doesn't always work out that way, as the disappointed people in Baltimore and Los Angeles could tell you, and thank goodness for that. Over the last couple of years, the Orioles and Dodgers have been the last vestiges of hope that you can't buy the championship, and the only reasons to not picket America's ballparks until Bob Costas becomes commissioner.</p>
        <p>Good for Steinbrenner if he sneered at Juan Gonzalez's asking price. If he wants Sammy Sosa, he's probably going to get him, one way or another. Too bad. Assuming the pitching improves -- and if it doesn't, this whole issue is moot -- it would be nice to see the old gang in a hot summer race.</p>
        <p>By all means, add a solid lefty bat. Get another quality starter. Nobody will object. But you can tell from the snippiness coming out of the clubhouse from typically sanguine sources such as Joe Torre and Derek Jeter that the proud Yankees are tired of hearing how much they need Sosa or Gonzalez to rescue them.</p>
        <p>It's doubtful that Jeter and O'Neil and even Knoblauch are scared by the Toronto Blue Jays and the Oakland A's, or by the prospect of a real playoff race. Not nearly as much as Steinbrenner often sounds.</p>
