        <p>In what appears to be a feud between one of pro basketball's top players and one of the sport's top agents, Stephon Marbury and David Falk parted yesterday.</p>
        <p>Marbury, a third-team All-National Basketball Association point guard, said he fired Falk because he failed to make good on the numerous endorsement opportunities he promised to deliver. Falk said he resigned because Marbury did not create a comfortable working environment.</p>
        <p>''I'm surprised it has come out in the public like this,'' Falk said late last night. ''My mother always taught me not to air your dirty laundry. I hoped we could keep it quiet.''</p>
        <p>Marbury received a letter from Falk yesterday saying that if certain issues in their business relationship were not rectified, Falk would resign as his agent. Marbury, who was growing disenchanted with Falk throughout last season, then fired him. He said he was doing it before  tomorrow's N.B.A. draft because he wanted to alert this year's top prospects not to buy into the dreams that agents often sell when recruiting a player.</p>
        <p>''My major problem was that I was promised deals and nothing happened,'' Marbury said by telephone from his home in northern New Jersey. ''I'm not going to say he lied because he might have thought that he was going to be able to do it. I'm just saying that he didn't come through so there's no purpose in me having somebody work for me who's not doing anything for me.''</p>
        <p>SFX, the company Falk works for, has already signed some of the top players in this year's draft, including Mike Miller, Morris Peterson, Etan Thomas and Quentin Richardson. Falk personally represents Darius Miles, a high school phenom from East St. Louis, Ill., who will be a high lottery pick.</p>
        <p>Even so, Marbury is the second young star to leave Falk within the past two years. Allen Iverson, the Philadelphia 76ers' dazzling shooting guard, left him last year. Marbury, 23, hired Falk during the 1998-1999 lockout, largely because Falk told him he would gain him numerous endorsement opportunities and possibly help work out a trade to New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Marbury, a native of Brooklyn, gives Falk credit for orchestrating the three-team deal that enabled him to be traded from Minnesota to the Nets in March 1999. Days after the trade, Marbury signed a six-year, $71 million contract extension, of which Falk receives 4 percent annually. Falk was also due to receive 15 percent of any endorsement contracts he procured for Marbury.</p>
        <p>''The only thing he got me was that he got the trade done for me and that's what I paid him for,'' Marbury said.</p>
        <p>Marbury was especially bothered over two specific endorsement-related incidents. First, he believes Falk wanted him to sign a bad deal with the shoe company And 1. Marbury also said that rather than securing advertising for his web site -- stephonmarbury.net -- Falk tried to get him to sell the rights to the site to another entity.</p>
        <p>Falk admits that the deal with And 1 was not the greatest and that he had trouble finding Marbury endorsements. But he added that Marbury turned down $10 million worth of endorsement opportunities.</p>
        <p>''It was not a perfect deal, but we thought it was a good deal,'' Falk said. ''Because of the lockout, the marketing well dried up. Do I think down the road that there will be great opportunities for Stephon Marbury? Yes, I think down the road there will be when the market comes back.''</p>
        <p>Marbury said he does not know if he will hire another agent. Because the new collective bargaining agreement sets caps on salaries, top players do not necessarily need agents to negotiate contracts for them.</p>
        <p>''I'm extremely fond of Stephon,'' Falk said. ''So I hope that in the future, I can restore my relationship with Stephon.''</p>
