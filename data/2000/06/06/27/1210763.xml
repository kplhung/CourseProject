        <p>It was not exactly a typical service call from Consolidated Edison. In fact, it was more of an out-of-service call.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Steven Mandelsberg, the president of the co-op board at the Carnegie Hill 91st Street Court on the Upper East Side, watched a Con Ed employee, escorted by two police officers, enter his building and direct the superintendent to lead them to the power supply. Then, Mr. Mandelsberg said, they cut the power to all the building's apartments except those where it was needed for medical reasons.</p>
        <p>The residential building was one of six, including a convent and a private school, to go dark on a muggy day with temperatures in the high 80's. The day had the heaviest use of electricity this year and the third highest on record.</p>
        <p>The power was restored by 11 p.m., Con Ed said.</p>
        <p>The six buildings, in which power was cut between 7:45 and 8:05 p.m., according to Con Ed, are clustered  within a larger area where service was only mildly affected. Con Ed reduced voltage by 8 percent in that area, between Fifth Avenue and Lexington Avenue and 110th Street and 78th Street, where it has 76,000 customers. Two hospitals and the Metropolitan Museum of Art were asked to switch to their own generators.</p>
        <p>Con Ed cut service when problems developed with 3 of the 28 feeder cables that carry electricity to the area. The six buildings, including 1107, 1115 and 1120 Fifth Avenue; 15 East 91st Street; the Sacred Heart Convent on East 91st Street; and Nightingale-Bamford School on East 92nd Street, were chosen because the cables supplying them with power were particularly stressed by the failures.</p>
        <p>Last year's 19-hour blackout in Washington Heights was caused when half the feeder cables to that neighborhood blew out at once.</p>
        <p>While many Upper East Side residents and businesses were not affected yesterday, some complained that their elevators, phone systems or appliances would not work. Residents of 12 East 97th Street found themselves suddenly living in an 11-floor walkup. The Gristede's Supermarket on 85th Street and Madison Avenue turned off its air-conditioning and turned up the refrigeration temperature of the food, but ''not enough to cause danger,'' said Carmelo Bilbraut, the manager.</p>
        <p>James Orcutt, the night desk manager at the Carlyle Hotel on East 76th Street, said that a few people who had lost power inquired about room availability.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Con Ed said that the power company was exercising extra caution. ''This is not only the highest usage day this year, this is the third-highest usage day in our records,'' said Joseph Petta, the spokesman.</p>
        <p>The top usage day on record came last July 6, during an intense heat wave. Con Edison shut off all electricity north of 155th Street after underground power lines failed and several lines caught fire. More than 200,000 residents of Washington Heights and Inwood were without power for 19 hours, and icons like the George Washington Bridge went dark.</p>
        <p>Last night, Tom DeMauex, the superintendent of an 18-story apartment building on Fifth Avenue where residents were using the service elevator, said the power restrictions boded ill. ''It's only the end of June; you've got the hotter months yet to come,'' he said. ''You'd think they'd be prepared for this after what happened last year.''</p>
        <p>Robert Bagnasco, the doorman at 12 East 97th Street, said that when he called Con Ed officials to tell them that the building's elevator was not working, he was not informed of the service cut. At 5 p.m., Con Ed sent out a news release asking Upper East Side residents not to use air-conditioners and washing machines, but Mr. Bagnasco said he had not been told about that either.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mandelsberg, the co-op board president, said, ''This is another instance of Con Ed's miserable relations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Petta said the company was acting responsibly, and that there were no reports of other heat-related power failures among its 1.3 million customers.</p>
        <p>He said that the convent's residents had volunteered to go to another building, and that at the other buildings, Con Ed representatives negotiated with the managers about what would be cut off.</p>
        <p>''In every case where the building's manager told us that something was essential to be left on, it was left on,'' Mr. Petta said.</p>
        <p>But the superintendent at 1107 Fifth Avenue, who refused to give his name, said he was given an ultimatum: turn off the electricity or Con Ed would do it for him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Petta explained that the system was designed to sustain any two pieces of malfunctioning equipment, so that at 9 p.m., when one feeder cable had been repaired, Con Ed was able to start restoring full power to the area.</p>
        <p>Last year's power failure, which affected neighborhoods that were overwhelmingly Hispanic and low-income, prompted complaints that Con Edison was more concerned with maintaining service in wealthier, whiter parts of the city.</p>
        <p>But investigations by the state attorney general's office and the Public Service Commission found no evidence that the utility maintained its system any differently in Upper Manhattan than elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Con Ed officials have said they would be spending $315 million on system upgrades over the next few years.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 1, 2000, Saturday  An article on Tuesday about power problems on the Upper East Side referred incorrectly to the Convent of the Sacret Heart, one of the six buildings that had its power cut by Con Edison. It is a school, not a convent.</p>
