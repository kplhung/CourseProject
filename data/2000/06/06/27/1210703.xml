        <p>Our topic for today, people, is The Proper Mate for Women in Politics.</p>
        <p>We are looking at today's state legislative primary in Goose Creek, S.C., in which Representative Shirley Hinson is being challenged by her estranged husband, Jimmy.</p>
        <p>''It's about the issues,'' says Mr. Hinson, who was arrested in 1998 for making a death threat against another state representative he believed was having an affair with his wife.</p>
        <p>''Desperate tactics for a desperate person,'' said Ms. Hinson, who once took out a restraining order against her husband, accusing him of stalking her at the Statehouse.</p>
        <p>We have been down this road before, more or less. There was the case of Representative Coya Knutson of Minnesota, whose bid for a third term in 1958 ended in disaster when her alcoholic husband published a ''Coya Come Home'' letter, accusing her of having an affair with her administrative assistant.</p>
        <p>Katherine Langley got elected to Congress from Kentucky in 1926 after her spouse, Representative John Wesley Langley, was sentenced to the federal pen for bootlegging. She talked Calvin Coolidge into pardoning him, and the newly sprung Mr. Langley immediately ran against her for his old seat. The third candidate, not married to either one of them, won.</p>
        <p>But our modern version of the disastrous political spouse generally tends more in the direction of overzealousness.</p>
        <p>We are thinking, for instance, of Albert Pirro, a lawyer in the New York City suburbs who devoted a great deal of energy to promoting the career of his wife, Jeanine, a rising Republican star and the current Westchester County district attorney. One of Mr. Pirro's 33 companies produced a cable TV show starring Mrs. Pirro. Another hired a political consultant to advise her on what to do when she developed one of those ''nanny'' tax problems that were all the rage in the early 90's. (The consultant's advice, which seemed to work well, was that Mrs. Pirro should come clean on her TV show.)</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Mr. Pirro deducted this stuff as business expenses, along with the family's six cars and an $1,800 wrought iron fence for the Vietnamese potbellied pigs. Last week he was convicted of tax evasion, and Mrs. Pirro's career is toast. However, women of the future may be able to pick up helpful hints from her story, such as the advisability of sticking to cocker spaniels as household pets. They may also conclude that when a spouse starts doing business through 33 different companies, it's time to start thinking separate tax returns.</p>
        <p>New York has never had much success at getting women elected to high office, but we're an absolute databank of what can go wrong in a political marriage. This year, of course, we've hit the jackpot with Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has already taught the world everything it needs to know about the perils of a dual-career candidacy. Never again will anyone running for anything promise the voters they will get two for the price of one.</p>
        <p>In a perfect world, politicians would all follow the example of the president in ''West Wing'' and marry physicians. Doctors can generally get a job anywhere, and you seldom see them wandering around the Capitol lobbying for legislation.</p>
        <p>Our latest Senate candidate, Representative Rick Lazio, had the good judgment to marry a nurse. (Yes, Mr. Lazio was the guy chosen to run against the first lady after the mayor's marriage imploded and the Westchester D.A.'s husband failed to convince a jury that the cost of fighting a paternity case was a legitimate business deduction. Is this a great state, or what?)</p>
        <p>Remarkably, Patricia Lazio does not seem to be under threat of indictment, nor was she exiled to the Food Channel for the duration of her husband's career, like Rudy Giuliani's estranged wife, a former TV anchor. She works part time at a hospital breast cancer unit. Everything seemed perfect until Mr. Lazio told reporters about a talk they had during a controversy over his stock investments. ''She said: 'Listen, you know what? We're honest, decent people. I clean my own house. We have nothing to be ashamed of,' '' he recounted.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lazio is currently trudging from Horseheads to Ogdensburg in support of her husband's Senate campaign, while caring for two small children and doing her job at the hospital. If she gets no help around the house, I think he can kiss the working women's vote good-bye.</p>
