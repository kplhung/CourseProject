        <p>Supporters of the California blanket primary law that was ruled unconstitutional yesterday by the United States Supreme Court say they will seek passage of a new measure that might be acceptable to the court yet still achieve the goal of opening primaries to more voters.</p>
        <p>In California's blanket primary there is only one ballot, and voters, regardless of party, vote for candidates, regardless of party. Republican and Democratic Party leaders and other opponents of such primaries hailed the ruling as validation of their argument that parties should be disciplined, cohesive political entities with the final say in who can vote in their primaries.</p>
        <p>Jon Fleischman, executive director of the California Republican Party, saw the court's decision as recognition that ''our members' right of association is paramount'' and that blanket primaries should be consigned to history's trash bin.</p>
        <p>''We are very pleased,'' Mr. Fleischman said.</p>
        <p>But speaking for advocates of a blanket primary, Nicholas Tobey, chairman of Californians to Protect the Open Primary, vowed that an effort would be made to pass a new law ''as soon as our lawyers can study the court's decision and figure out the course.''</p>
        <p>''We're just beginning to fight,'' Mr. Tobey said.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Tobey and other advocates read the decision, it did not, at first glance, make the right of association paramount and close every door on their effort to open up the voting process.</p>
        <p>''We don't know exactly how to write the new law yet, but we hope to have something new on the books within another year or so,'' Mr. Tobey said. ''Best we can tell, it looks like if you keep things as nonpartisan as possible and then send the top two finishers in each contest on to November.</p>
        <p>''Louisiana has a system along those lines,'' he added. ''The main thing is to get more people involved, let them have a say too, not just Democrats and Republicans but everybody -- independents and smaller parties, just everybody.''</p>
        <p>The state's chief election official, Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican, broke with his party and sided with the blanket primary advocates, warning that the Supreme Court decision would make California, once again, a state that ''the parties solely control.''</p>
        <p>''I don't know who the parties are afraid of,'' said Mr. Jones, who won office with the help of some Democratic and independent votes. ''The vast majority of their members supported this.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones was referring to a 1996 ballot initiative in which Californians overwhelmingly approved the blanket primary system. Until then, the state's voters could participate only in their own party's primary, a system known as a closed primary.</p>
        <p>California's governor, Gray Davis, a Democrat who like Mr. Jones won with the help of voters outside his party, also broke with his party on the primary issue, saying that he would do ''everything possible'' to find a substitute blanket primary system.</p>
