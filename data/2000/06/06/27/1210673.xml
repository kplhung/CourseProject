        <p>Common, the rapper who headlined the concert at Central Park Summerstage on Saturday, has two things that are hard to find in current commercial hip-hop: respect for women and music from a live band. He has set out to be one of rap's good guys, aligning himself with the non-gangsta wing of hip-hop that includes Black Thought, Erykah Badu, the Roots and De La Soul. ''It doesn't mean that I hate,'' he rapped. ''I just want to innovate.</p>
        <p>Common, who called himself Common Sense when he started performing in the early 1990's, pours out words in articulate, conversational lines and quick triplets.

        <p>Common, the rapper who headlined the concert at Central Park Summerstage on Saturday, has two things that are hard to find in current commercial hip-hop: respect for women and music from a live band. He has set out to be one of rap's good guys, aligning himself with the non-gangsta wing of hip-hop that includes Black Thought, Erykah Badu, the Roots and De La Soul. ''It doesn't mean that I hate,'' he rapped. ''I just want to innovate.</p>
        <p>Common, who called himself Common Sense when he started performing in the early 1990's, pours out words in articulate, conversational lines and quick triplets. He did some boasting and reminiscing; he also preached about God, urged unity and compared hip-hop to a girl seduced by the gangsta way of life. ''I'm gonna take her back,'' he vowed.</p>
        <p>He ended his set with ''The Light,'' a love letter in which he promises to be faithful and to work at keeping the romance together. Women in the crowd happily sang along with the promises in the chorus.</p>
        <p>His band leans toward smooth jazz vamps, with a trumpeter who has been listening to Miles Davis; it also tried some funk, which was less convincing. To underline Common's most ardent songs, a singer named Bilal, whose album is due later this year, came out to belt endearments in ardent, swooping melismas that sometimes went astray. Common's charm is in his earnestness. Who could dislike someone who urges the audience to join in by declaring, ''Come on, y'all know I can't sing''?</p>
        <p>Common's ''Time Traveling,'' on his current album, ''Like Water for Chocolate'' (MCA), draws its groove from Afro-Beat, the music created  by the Nigerian band leader and gadfly Fela Anikulapo Kuti, who died in  1997. At Summerstage, Common shared the bill with Fela's longtime drummer, Tony Allen and his band.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen doesn't try to recreate the sound of Fela's Afrika 70; instead of that band's burly horn section, he has a disc jockey scratching records and a keyboardist who also uses whistling, buzzing analog synthesizer sounds. They leave plenty of space for the music's bass lines and Mr. Allen's magnificent drumming.</p>
        <p>Like Joseph Modeliste of the Meters and James Brown's drummers Clyde Stubblefield and John Starks, Mr. Allen atomizes the rhythm and keeps only the accents that will make it jump most succinctly. Using elements of funk, Afro-Beat and Nigerian juju, he often reduces the beat to bass drum and high-hat cymbals; with the high-hats ticking and hissing the off-beats, his drumming moves like a rattlesnake.</p>
        <p>The songs, like Fela's, are often two-chord vamps, carrying slogans like ''Everybody la-la-la get together'' that Mr. Allen intones from behind the drums. Late in Mr. Allen's set, Keziah Jones came out to sing smoother melodies. There were also jabbing, modal electric-piano solos and some wailing electric guitar. But the music's center is in its insistent bass riffs and the way Mr. Allen's drumming ricochets against them: a groove that's perpetually danceable.</p>
        <p>Ex-Centric Sound System opened the concert. Led by Yossi Fine, a bassist with a long career as a sideman, it merges an Israeli rhythm section with musicians from Ghana who sing and play balafon (marimba), mbira (thumb piano) and wooden flutes; it also tosses in samples of ethnographic field recordings. With bass riffs out of reggae, hard rock and funk, Ex-Centric Sound System  and Weather Report wants to make one-world music, but it risks pureeing its ingredients into pleasant, undistinguished background music.</p>
