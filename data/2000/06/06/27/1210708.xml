        <p>Japanese voters handed a well-deserved rebuke Sunday to the Liberal Democrats, the party that has held power in Tokyo for all but 18 months since 1955. The chief opposition party, the reform-minded Democratic Party, gained an impressive 32 seats, almost as many as the Liberal Democrats lost. But the opposition forces remain weak and divided, and the present ruling coalition will retain a slim majority.</p>
        <p>The long-run message for the Liberal Democrats, however, is bleak. Young urban Japanese have grown disenchanted with the party's factional maneuvering, secretive ways and inability to extricate the country from a decade-long economic slump.</p>

        <p>Japanese voters handed a well-deserved rebuke Sunday to the Liberal Democrats, the party that has held power in Tokyo for all but 18 months since 1955. The chief opposition party, the reform-minded Democratic Party, gained an impressive 32 seats, almost as many as the Liberal Democrats lost. But the opposition forces remain weak and divided, and the present ruling coalition will retain a slim majority.</p>
        <p>The long-run message for the Liberal Democrats, however, is bleak. Young urban Japanese have grown disenchanted with the party's factional maneuvering, secretive ways and inability to extricate the country from a decade-long economic slump.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, who is party leader, has further diminished the Liberal Democrats' appeal through his stumbling performance. His two months in office have been marred by a series of verbal blunders, including some disturbing invocations of Japan's militarist past. During the campaign he invited undecided voters to ''stay in bed'' on Election Day, a distressing posture for a leader who should be expanding democratic participation. Mr. Mori is expected to stay in office through next month's G-8 economic summit meeting in Osaka. But he will probably be replaced as prime minister before elections for Parliament's upper house next year.</p>
        <p>The Liberal Democrats' problems run deeper than one individual, of course. Established during the cold war as a bulwark against Communism and Socialism, the party has had little competition from other parties. With all meaningful politics occurring inside party ranks, the Liberal Democrats developed strong internal factions, glued together by campaign cash and patronage. Factional leaders secretively manage all important decisions, including the choice of prime ministers, with no public accountability. The selection of Mr. Mori, after the sudden disability of his predecessor, was handled particularly clumsily.</p>
        <p>The Liberal Democrats' main strategy against recession has been public works spending, with projects awarded disproportionately to rural districts where the party is strong. This has alienated urban voters and has created huge deficits without triggering sustained growth. A healthy recovery is unlikely without broad reforms, including the kind of aggressive deregulation the Liberal Democrats traditionally resist.</p>
        <p>The opposition Democrats do not have a fully convincing economic program either. They strongly favor needed deregulation, but they also campaigned for public spending cuts and tax increases. With Japan's economy barely stirring, such deflationary policies would be a serious mistake.</p>
        <p>For now, however, it is the policy choices of the Liberal Democrats that count. Sunday's stinging reverse should spur the party to adopt a more transparent leadership process and to embrace the necessity for economic reform.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 28, 2000, Wednesday  An editorial last Thursday misstated the number of white farmers in Zimbabwe who have been killed by President Robert Mugabe's supporters. The number is five, not one. And an editorial yesterday gave the wrong location for next month's economic summit meeting in Japan. It will be in Okinawa, not Osaka.</p>
