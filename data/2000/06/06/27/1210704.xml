        <p>The much-anticipated consolidation of the online grocery market got under way today with the announcement that the Webvan Group Inc. would acquire HomeGrocer.com Inc. in a stock swap valued at approximately $1.2 billion, based on Friday's closing price of $8.72 a share for Webvan stock.</p>
        <p>But while analysts praised the deal as one that would help cement Webvan's market leadership, investors focused on the uncertainties of melding two disparate business models and technology bases, sending shares in both companies down.

        <p>The much-anticipated consolidation of the online grocery market got under way today with the announcement that the Webvan Group Inc. would acquire HomeGrocer.com Inc. in a stock swap valued at approximately $1.2 billion, based on Friday's closing price of $8.72 a share for Webvan stock.</p>
        <p>But while analysts praised the deal as one that would help cement Webvan's market leadership, investors focused on the uncertainties of melding two disparate business models and technology bases, sending shares in both companies down. Shares of Webvan fell $1.40, to $7.3125, while HomeGrocer fell $1.21, to $6.875.</p>
        <p>Web grocers have been among the hardest hit since investors began to flee e-commerce stocks late last year, raising questions about the companies' abilities to raise the capital needed for expansion. Shares in Webvan, which went public in November 1999, have traded as high as $34 but are now well below the original public offering price of $15. HomeGrocer went public in March at $12 but now trades below that price.  Amazon.com owns about 22 percent of HomeGrocer.</p>
        <p>''The deal lets these two companies come together and be the leader,'' said Lauren Levitan, an analyst with Robertson Stephens. ''Instead of competing with each other, they can focus their attention on the real challenger in the space, which is the traditional grocery business. But it will take some time to see if the executional complexity of this is paying off. Just because it's strategically appropriate, doesn't mean it will work.''</p>
        <p>Webvan, which is based in Foster City, Calif., will exchange 1.07605 of its shares for each HomeGrocer.com share. Approximately 138 million shares of Webvan stock will be exchanged for the outstanding shares of HomeGrocer.com, which is based in Kirkland, Wash.</p>
        <p>Webvan and HomeGrocer both offer home delivery of groceries and other consumer items in key metropolitan markets across the United States. But both have repeatedly stressed that they are not in the notoriously low-profit-margin grocery business, but are instead last-mile Internet retailers, competing as much with U.P.S. for rapid package delivery as they do with Safeway for food sales. Last-mile retailers operate their own fleets of trucks, unlike Amazon.com, which relies on the U.S. Postal Service and other carriers.</p>
        <p>''Webvan's combination with HomeGrocer harnesses the energy and resources of both organizations and creates an even more attractive shopping proposition for consumers -- one that will draw them out of traditional stores and into our Internet marketplace,'' George T. Shaheen, Webvan's president and chief executive, said in a statement. ''With this merger, we are moving early and aggressively to consolidate two successful companies to build a strong last-mile Internet retailer.''</p>
        <p>The company still faces several major competitors in the online grocery field, like Peapod Inc., Netgrocer and Streamline.</p>
        <p>Frustrated in its attempts to raise equity financing in the public markets, Peapod, the first online grocery, sold a 51 percent stake in April  to Royal Ahold, the Dutch food provider, for $73 million, or $3.75 a share.</p>
        <p>Webvan said it expected the combined companies market to reach from 9 major metropolitan areas currently to a total of 13 metropolitan areas by the end of 2000. By the end of the year, as a result of the merger, Webvan said it expects to serve metropolitan areas in Atlanta; Baltimore; Bergen County, N.J.; Chicago; Dallas; Los Angeles; Orange County, Calif.; Portland, Ore.; Sacramento; San Diego; San Francisco; Seattle and Washington. Peapod operates in nine U.S. markets.</p>
        <p>Ms. Levitan said the acquisition should help Webvan continue its expansion without tapping the capital markets so frequently. ''This is a very capital-intensive business, there's no getting around that,'' she said. ''That said, combining these two companies should reduce that, because they won't be raising capital just to compete with each other.''</p>
        <p>Upon completion of the acquisition, Webvan's founder, Louis H. Borders, also a co-founder of Borders Books, will remain chairman of Webvan and Mr. Shaheen will be president and chief executive of the combined company.</p>
