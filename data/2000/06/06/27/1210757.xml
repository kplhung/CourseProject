        <p>Bringing new blood to his management team, Matthew Goldstein, chancellor of the far-flung City University system, named a former New Jersey hospital president and a former legal official in the Koch administration to fill two of the university's top posts yesterday.</p>
        <p>Dr. Goldstein named David H. Freed, the recent president of Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J., to the new position of senior vice chancellor and chief operating officer. And he appointed Frederick P. Schaffer, a partner in the litigation department of Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel L.L.P., a New York law firm, as vice chancellor for legal affairs and general counsel to the board of trustees.</p>
        <p>Three other CUNY officials were promoted to senior positions, including one to the interim presidency of Queens College. All the appointments were ratified last night by CUNY's board of trustees.</p>
        <p>Dr. Goldstein also unveiled a more exacting performance evaluation system to assess the presidents, deans and 350 other administrators on CUNY's 20 campuses and at headquarters. The presidents will be judged on everything from graduation rates to fund-raising to student performance on professional certification exams.</p>
        <p>''Revolution is a strong word, but this is a totally different way of holding the senior executives in the university responsible,'' Dr. Goldstein said yesterday. He said he planned to spend much of the summer meeting with campus leaders to work out the goals and objectives for them and their individual campuses.</p>
        <p>Stanley O. Ikenberry, president of the American Council on Education, based in Washington, called the evaluation system trend-setting.</p>
        <p>''Every university likes to think it rewards its people on the basis of performance,'' he said. ''But more often than not, they fail to state the criteria clearly and measure achievement against those criteria.''</p>
        <p>CUNY has already said that to help it create more distinct tiers among its colleges, it will differentiate among the salaries of its presidents, paying more to those at the senior colleges and more to research-oriented campuses and those with graduate programs. Previously, all of CUNY's presidents earned $137,000. Now, they will range from $137,000 to $201,000, with the ceiling for community college presidents at $162,000. Dr. Goldstein said that in the most recent annual review, 50 administrators got no raises.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freed is a graduate of Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration with master's degrees in business administration and in health services management from New York University. He has held executive or managerial positions at several nonprofit organizations, including Hahnemann University in Philadelphia, Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schaffer, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, was an assistant United States attorney and an assistant corporation counsel in New York City and counsel to Mayor Edward I. Koch and taught at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, as well as working as a litigator in private practice.</p>
        <p>From within CUNY, the board promoted Sherry F. Brabham to vice chancellor for budget, finance and administrative computing, a post she has held on an interim basis since February 1999. She previously was CUNY's budget director and a vice president for finance and business at Queens College.</p>
        <p>The university also named Otis O. Hill as vice chancellor for student services and enrollment management. A graduate of Knoxville College in Tennessee, he earned an Ed.D. in labor studies at Rutgers University and has spent 30 years at City University's Kingsborough Community College, the last six as vice president for student development.</p>
        <p>CUNY also named Russell K. Hotzler, university dean for academic affairs, as interim president at Queens College, replacing Allen L. Sessoms.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hotzler, who earned his bachelor's degree and doctorate in physical metallurgy from Polytechnic Institute (now Polytechnic University), was vice president and dean of academic affairs at Queensborough Community College before becoming university dean.</p>
        <p>He has focused on math and science teaching and on helping CUNY colleges to improve their teacher education programs so they meet the new state standards.</p>
