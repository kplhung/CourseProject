        <p>THE pursuit of tobacco companies as public enemies has now produced the following:</p>
        <p>One tobacco company, Philip Morris, gets to buy a food company, Nabisco, at a relatively low price.</p>
        <p>Another tobacco company, R. J. Reynolds, gets about $1.5 billion in cash as a sort of litigation gift.</p>
        <p>The shareholders who used to control the food company get less than they might have received, because of fear that class-action litigation may yet bankrupt the tobacco companies. Still, they are doing much better than before Carl C. Icahn put Nabisco into play.</p>
        <p>The complex transaction by which Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette company, will buy Nabisco -- a company that used to be part of a company that owned Reynolds, the No. 2 cigarette maker -- is a monument to the fear that class-action suits will drive the tobacco companies into bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>That is the part of this arrangement that gives the deal its most unusual aspect: the gift of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in cash to R. J. Reynolds. That reflects the possibility that Nabisco Group Holdings, as the former corporate parent of Reynolds, may have a residual liability for Reynolds debts if Reynolds is driven into bankruptcy by tobacco litigation.</p>
        <p>There was one company for which that residual liability would be unimportant: Reynolds itself. It is taking on no additional risks by guaranteeing its own debts. And it will clear $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion just by giving that guarantee, assuming that the deal is completed as planned.</p>
        <p>Under normal circumstances, that might outrage owners of Nabisco Group Holdings stock, who by accepting an offer of $30 a share are effectively agreeing to take 16.7 percent less than the value of their company's assets, based on the $55 a share being paid to the shareowners of Nabisco Holdings, the food unit. But there are not likely to be many complaints, since the shareholders will be receiving more than the stock has traded for in recent years -- and more than three times the price in the open market only a few months ago.</p>
        <p>The unusual corporate structure for Nabisco stemmed from a long series of corporate machinations. First, R. J. Reynolds acquired Nabisco in 1985. In 1989, the new company, RJR Nabisco, was taken private in a leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.</p>
        <p>The public was allowed back into RJR Nabisco in 1991, when stock was sold in an initial public offering at a price well above its current value.</p>
        <p>Kohlberg Kravis got out of the company in 1994 by trading much of its stake for ownership of Borden, an underperforming food company. In 1995, with litigation pressure growing on tobacco companies, RJR Nabisco sold a minority stake in Nabisco Holdings to the public. If the idea was to show that the parent company ought to have a higher stock price, it didn't work.</p>
        <p>Just over a year ago, RJR Nabisco spun off its ownership of R. J. Reynolds to its shareholders. The parent company was renamed Nabisco Group Holdings.</p>
        <p>After that spinoff, an owner of one share of Nabisco Group Holdings effectively owned 0.655 share of Nabisco Holdings, the food company. But that parent company also faced the possibility of being held liable if R. J. Reynolds was unable to pay its bills. The size of the discount reflected just how worried investors were.</p>
        <p>Right after the spinoff, the discount was 22 percent. But the discount deepened to nearly 60 percent early in February. Then Mr. Icahn became involved, setting off the process that culminated in the latest deal, which was well received on Wall Street yesterday. Philip Morris shares rose $3.50, to $27.125; Nabisco Group Holdings added 93.75 cents, to $26.50; Nabisco Holdings rose $1.125, at $52.75; and Reynolds gained $1.50, to $28.375.</p>
        <p>Now Philip Morris will own a huge food company, composed of its old Kraft and its new Nabisco units. It plans to sell a minority stake in that to the public. When that happens, it will become clear that Philip Morris, like RJR Nabisco before it, is worth less than the sum of its parts. Then, Wall Street will start talking about how to realize the value of that food operation.</p>
