        <p>The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether people, including journalists, may be sued for disclosing the contents of telephone calls that were illegally intercepted and recorded by someone else.</p>

        <p>The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether people, including journalists, may be sued for disclosing the contents of telephone calls that were illegally intercepted and recorded by someone else.</p>
        <p>The court accepted a case from Pennsylvania that is expected to help define the balance between the First Amendment rights of Americans to disseminate information, and state and federal wiretapping laws intended to prevent people from intercepting private conversations.</p>
        <p>The Pennsylvania case involved a tape recording made illegally of a cell phone conversation that was later given to a radio station, which broadcast it repeatedly. The case is likely to affect a similar lawsuit brought by a Republican leader in the House against a Democratic colleague for disclosing a taped cell phone conversation among Republican leaders about the House ethics investigation of former Speaker Newt Gingrich.</p>
        <p>The court's decision to hear the case was one of many actions today as the justices moved to conclude their term this week. The court also agreed to revisit a North Carolina case to see if race played too large a role in how a Congressional district was created.</p>
        <p>The wiretap case involved heated contract negotiations between the teachers union and the school board in the Wyoming Valley West School District. A teacher who was president of the union was talking on her cell phone with the union's chief negotiator and said angrily that if school board members did not budge from their offer, the teachers were going to ''blow off the front porches'' of their homes. An opponent of the teachers union said he found a tape recording of the conversation in his mailbox and gave it to a radio station, which eventually broadcast it.</p>
        <p>Neither the teachers' opponent nor the radio station was involved in intercepting or taping the conversation, according to the record. The federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled 2 to 1 that wiretapping laws could not be extended to the defendants because that would violate constitutional guarantees of free speech.  The outcome will have particular significance for news organizations and will almost certainly bear on a lawsuit brought by Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, against Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington.</p>
        <p>In December 1996, a Florida couple illegally taped a cell phone conversation in which Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Boehner and other Republican leaders were heard discussing matters related to Mr. Gingrich's ethics case. The couple gave the tape to Mr. McDermott, who passed it on to the House ethics committee. The New York Times and several other news organizations published transcripts of the conversations. An appeals court in the District of Columbia had ruled 2 to 1 that the Boehner suit could go forward.</p>
        <p>The Pennsylvania cases are Bartnicki v. Vopper (99-1687) and United States v. Vopper (99-1728).</p>
        <p>In other matters, the court dealt with these cases:</p>
        <p>Traffic Stop</p>
        <p>The court also agreed to hear the appeal of a Texas woman who was arrested, handcuffed and jailed because she and her two children did not use seat belts.</p>
        <p>The case involves the reach of Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure by the police. Lawyers for the Texas woman, Gail Atwater, argued that the traffic stops are the most frequent experience Americans have with the Fourth Amendment as there are 185 million licensed drivers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Atwater was driving her two children home one afternoon in 1997 when her truck was stopped by Bart Turek, then a Lago Vista, Tex., police officer, because no one had the seat belt fastened.</p>
        <p>Texas law gives police the discretion to make arrests for routine traffic violations, except for speeding. Mr. Turek arrested Ms. Atwater, handcuffed her and took her to the police station. She was booked and placed in a cell for about an hour before she appeared before a magistrate and paid a $50 fine, the maximum penalty for the offense.</p>
        <p>The case is Atwater v. Lago Vista (99-1408).</p>
        <p>Redistricting</p>
        <p>The court agreed to consider once again how much the issue of race may be used in drawing lines for a Congressional district.</p>
        <p>The case involves the 12th District in North Carolina, which has been represented since 1992 by Melvin Watt, a Democrat.</p>
        <p>After the Supreme Court ruled that the 1992 boundaries were so extraordinary as to be unconstitutional, the district was redrawn in 1997. This time, the General Assembly tried to avoid some of the odd features that attracted the court, like the way the district jumped back and forth across a highway to take in more black voters.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the new plan was challenged as relying too heavily on race, and a three-judge appeals court agreed, saying District 12 remained ''an impermissible and unconstitutional racial gerrymander.''</p>
        <p>The cases are Hunt vs. Cromartie (99-1864) and Smallwood vs. Cromartie (99-1865).</p>
        <p>School Prayer</p>
        <p>The court set aside an appeals court ruling that let public school students in an Alabama county lead group prayers at graduations, assemblies and sports events.</p>
        <p>The justices told a federal appeals court in Atlanta to restudy the case in light of a school-prayer decision announced last week in a Texas case. In that ruling, the court said prayer in public schools must be private and that such prayers at high school football games violated the separation of church and state.</p>
        <p>In 1993, Alabama enacted a law requiring public schools to allow student-initiated prayer at ''compulsory or noncompulsory'' school activities.</p>
        <p>The case is Michael Chandler v. Siegelman (99-935).</p>
        <p>License to Practice Law</p>
        <p>The court rejected the appeal of a white supremacist in Illinois who said the state committee that denied him a law license violated his free-speech rights. The court rejected Matthew Hale's arguments that Illinois had used ''orthodox religious and political beliefs to which (an aspiring lawyer) must subscribe as a condition of admission.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hale, of East Peoria, a leader of the segregationist World Church of the Creator, was denied a law license last summer, even though he graduated from Southern Illinois University's law school and passed the state bar exam. State bar officials noted that he had ''dedicated his life to inciting racial hatred,'' and said that ''he cannot do this as an officer of the court.''</p>
        <p>The case is Hale v. Committee on Character and Fitness (99-1349).</p>
        <p>Assistance to Counsel</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court agreed to consider when a criminal defense lawyer's failure to challenge a sentencing error should result in a ruling that the defendant did not have adequate legal representation.</p>
        <p>The case involves Paul L. Glover, former vice president and general counsel of Chicago Truck Drivers, Helpers and Warehouse Workers Union, who was convicted of racketeering and conspiracy charges. Mr. Glover has argued that he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing because his lawyer failed to challenge a sentence that was up to 21 months longer than he should have received.</p>
        <p>The case is Glover v. U.S. (99-8576).</p>
