        <p>Bruce Weber reviews Peter Zablotsky's play Off the Meter, directed by John Ahlers (M)</p>

        <p>'Off the Meter'  Hudson Guild Theater</p>
        <p>The idea of this play by Peter Zablotsky is that a cabdriver and an investment banker have more in common than you might think, namely that they are both working men vulnerable to exploitation by the boss and susceptible to the lure of the quick buck. The vehicle (pardon the pun) for this message is a scheme in  which Eddie, a dimwitted cabby with gambling debts (Gary Lowery), induces a frequent passenger, a banker named Mr. Johnson (Kent Jackman), to accept payments from the gangster who owns the cab company in exchange for insider stock tips.</p>
        <p>If this were a crisply told tale, the elements that evoke disbelief might have been dispelled, but the script is full of unwieldy exposition, and it is directed with such plodding indulgence by John Ahlers that in one scene the audience actually watches a character sleep. Neither Mr. Zablotsky, with his dialogue, nor Mr. Ahlers, with his eye or his ear, has helped the actors (they include Tim Miller and David Blackman) find much idiosyncrasy in stock roles.</p>
        <p>Even so, plausibility is the chief issue here, and though the playwright explains how the illicit scheme works, the idea that a Wall Street banker would go into criminal partnership with his unreliable driver and his unidentified sponsor is a grievous stretch to begin with. Now imagine the driver's being caught  going through the banker's briefcase and the banker shrugging it off -- it's a sign of developing friendship -- and you've got an idea of what the audience is asked to accept.</p>
