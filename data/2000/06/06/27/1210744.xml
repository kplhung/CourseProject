        <p>It has been 14 years since Interior Minister Natan Sharansky began making the transition from icon to man when he emigrated to Israel. It has been four since he morphed further from man to politician.</p>
        <p>But his experience as a prisoner of conscience in the former Soviet Union not only stamped him forever; it also shaped others' expectations of him in unyielding ways.</p>
        <p>To Israelis and to Jews worldwide, Mr. Sharansky is somewhat frozen in time behind the bars where he sat for nine years while they invested in him as a hero and fought for his freedom. And everything that he does is judged as a return on that investment, which means some amount of disappointment for everyone, left and right, secular and religious.</p>
        <p>''Everybody marched for me,'' Mr. Sharanksy, 52, said in an interview today. ''And everybody feels I owe them.''</p>
        <p>Right now, Mr. Sharansky is fighting an uphill battle to persuade Prime Minister Ehud Barak to join hands with the rightist Likud Party to form a national unity government. He portrays this, too, as an outgrowth of his days as a Soviet dissident. In his old punishment cell, he says, he did not distinguish between different kinds of Jews, and ever since meeting the divided reality of the Jewish nation, he has sought to forge a consensus.</p>
        <p>Some lionize him for this, and contend that Mr. Sharansky would be an ideal national leader, much as he would break the mold with his thickly accented Hebrew and a military record that consists of three weeks in the national guard.</p>
        <p>But critics of Mr. Sharansky, who tend to be disillusioned friends and former supporters, contend that for all his talk of healing, he is a divisive force.</p>
        <p>Doves here long ago stopped expressing their disappointment that Mr. Sharanksy, a former human rights champion, ended up taking a hard line on peace and joining the nationalist camp. Now, though, they say their disappointment has turned to anxiety.</p>
        <p>Since last week, Mr. Sharansky, through publicized letters to the prime minister, has been demanding that Mr. Barak apply the brakes instead of pedaling furiously toward an Israeli-Palestinian summit meeting in the United States. If Mr. Barak does not stop to brief his coalition in detail and take into account opposing points of view, Mr. Sharansky said, he will not accompany him to a summit conference and he will quit the government.</p>
        <p>Quitting is a threat that Mr. Sharansky has made before, not only to Mr. Barak but also to Benjamin Netanyahu, the rightist prime minister who preceded him. But right now it is a threat with real teeth because a pullout by Mr. Sharansky would endanger Mr. Barak's fragile coalition during a tense round of peace negotiations. Even though Mr. Sharansky's party, Yisrael B'Alyia, holds only four seats in Parliament, his departure would be unsettling.</p>
        <p>''If you're talking about the size of his party, he's a somewhat peripheral figure,'' said Yaron Ezrahi, a Hebrew University political scientist. ''But his power exceeds his party's stature, both because the government is now extraordinarily fragile and because he is Natan, ne Anatoly, Sharansky.''</p>
        <p>''He is like an epic hero of the Jewish people for the 20th century, even though something happened on the way from Anatoly to Natan,'' Mr. Ezrahi added, referring to the Russian given name and the chosen Hebrew one.</p>
        <p>Former associates say that what happened is politics. ''He survived the Gulag, and now he's applying the same rules of survival to the political arena,'' said Hirsh Goodman, a columnist for the magazine Jerusalem Report who used to be a close friend of Mr. Sharansky. ''He's wooing a constituency, and turning his back on the liberal human rights personality that he was. I think he's an obstructionist, and intellectually and politically dishonest, but, hey, that's just playing the brutal rules of the political game in this country.''</p>
        <p>Indicative of what a lightning rod he has become, Mr. Sharansky's fans maintain the exact opposite, that only he rises above the political swamp.</p>
        <p>''Suffering does deepen people, and he's the least petty person in the country,'' said Jonathan Rosenblum, a columnist and a spokesman for Am Ehad, an Orthodox advocacy group. ''He really believes in compromise not as a necessity of government, but as a fundamental principle.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Sharansky went on a television program recently, the host made a word play on his name, calling him ''Psharansky,'' which incorporates the Hebrew word for compromise. Mr. Sharansky took it as a compliment. But his media adviser was horrified because he knew that Israelis -- and especially Russian-Israelis -- would read it as an insult, a synonym for ''weak.''</p>
        <p>The editor of Vesti, a Russian-language newspaper here, says the immigrants are applauding Mr. Sharansky's ''very strong and very tough position of recent days.'' Mr. Sharansky's constituency tends to be antagonistic to the idea that Israel, such a small country compared with  the former Soviet Union, would make territorial concessions.</p>
        <p>''We try not to give grades to our politicians,'' said Elia Naymark, the editor. ''But in the last few days, his score is very high. Because a lot of immigrants from Russia support the right-wing position. They kept waiting for him to speak up. And now that's what he's doing, what has to be done.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Sharansky and his fellow former refuseniks have gravitated through the years to the right of the Israeli political spectrum. Their experience in Russia apparently  taught them to disdain concessions  to an ideological foe. Reared in an empire, they also never quite understood the logic of ceding territory to an adversary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharansky does not precisely share his constituents' main concern, the one about land. To him, the ideological obstacle to plunging into peacemaking is that he would be hesitant to trust an agreement forged with what he sees as an authoritarian regime, like that of Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. He thinks that Israel is giving and not getting, that it should be demanding democratization, changes in Palestinian textbooks and the confiscation of illegal weapons in exchange for territorial concessions.</p>
        <p>''It's very easy to live in the abstract love of the people of the world, and the so-called new Middle East,'' he said. ''Everyone will be kind and good if we just sign on the bottom line. But that's a good way maybe to commit suicide, not to build a real peace.''</p>
        <p>Many, including critics, are charmed by Mr. Sharansky personally. Short and bald, he is nobody's blow-dried politician, and he seems, in all ways but intellectually, quite unpretentious. He sits in the front seat beside his driver, for instance, instead of in the back as if his government-issued Volvo were a limousine. He hangs on his office wall a rubberized caricature of himself, a puppet from a political satire show here.</p>
        <p>Next to his desk sits a chess board suspended in mid-game. It is part of his lore that he is a chess wizard who played in his head when he was imprisoned. Now, as then, he said, he is always in the middle of a game with himself, but ''the board helps.''</p>
        <p>Some who once admired him worry that he is cultivating a cult-like following. ''In his thinking, it is not the immigrants who sent him to the Parliament, but he who brought them there,'' said Dr. Roman Bronfman, who split from Mr. Sharansky last year to form a small left-secular Russian party. ''He feels like a messiah.''</p>
        <p>Asked how he would describe his evolution since the Soviets released him and allowed him to emigrate to Israel in 1986, Mr. Sharansky said longingly that everything used to be black and white. ''The main principle then was: no compromise,'' he said. ''In the morning, you said no to the K.G.B., and in the evening you said no. You could feel yourself a tzaddik.'' That is a holy man.</p>
        <p>''In the free world,'' Mr. Sharansky continued, ''it is a lot more complicated.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Sharansky weighs in on broad national issues like peacemaking, some here accuse him of overstepping his bounds. His party is supposed to be what they call here a kielbasa party -- that is, only interested in its next handout. Mr. Sharansky said some people say to him, ''How dare you take big stands when your people are only interested in sausage!''</p>
        <p>He says he thinks that Prime Minister Barak is trying to co-opt him by inviting him to attend a summit meeting, if there is one, in Washington. He thinks Mr. Barak will make it impossible for those who oppose an agreement to reject it, because ''the impatient world'' will be applauding Israel ''in front of all the cameras.'' Israel would risk international isolation to turn its back on such approbation.</p>
        <p>So that, he said, is why he is acting to halt things in their tracks, and urging Mr. Barak to form a partnership with Ariel Sharon, the rightist Likud leader. Mr. Sharon, he said, will abandon his uncompromising positions once he is inside the circle of power.</p>
