        <p>After a period of rip-roaring growth that fueled fears of inflation, the economy is showing enough signs of slowing that the Federal Reserve will probably leave interest rate policy unchanged when it meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, economists and analysts say.</p>
        <p>But as it looks ahead, the Fed faces two big uncertainties that could lead it back to raising rates later in the year.</p>
        <p>It is not at all clear, Fed officials say, that the slowdown of the last few months will not give way to another resurgence in growth and inflation pressures. In each of the last two years, growth slowed in the spring, only to come storming back.</p>
        <p>And even if the economy is cooling, the Fed will have to decide just how cool is cool enough. Indeed, the central bank will have to resolve an internal debate over whether it is sufficient to slow growth to a pace that would keep unemployment at its current level of around 4 percent, or whether it will need to push harder on the brakes and drive unemployment up, perhaps to 5 percent or higher, to ensure that inflation remains in check.</p>
        <p>The Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate by 1.75 percentage points, to 6.5 percent, in six increments over the last year. Economic indicators released over the last month have suggested that the higher rates are beginning to rein in the economy by damping the spending of consumers, slowing the pace of job creation and taking some of the steam out of the stock market.</p>
        <p>But Fed officials have been wary of declaring that growth is back under control. In public and private statements, they have indicated that they need to see a few more months of data to be sure that the economy is responding as they want it to. And a number of them have emphasized in public appearances in recent weeks not the evidence that growth is slowing, but rather signs that ''core'' inflation -- excluding often volatile food and energy prices -- is beginning to creep up.</p>
        <p>The most recent data, Robert T. Parry, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a speech this month, ''makes it pretty clear that we've reached a stage where inflation is no longer falling.''</p>
        <p>Still, Fed officials have done nothing to counter the impression among investors and analysts that they are willing to put policy on hold until August, when they meet next, to give themselves more time to assess the effect of higher rates on the economy. As concerned as they are about inflation, the last thing Fed officials want to do is tighten policy so much that they stamp out the nation's longest economic expansion.</p>
        <p>''It looks as if the economy is behaving the way it should under tighter monetary policy,'' said Allen Sinai, an economist at Primark Decision Economics. ''The Fed can wait and define the slowdown and the inflation response more clearly before taking any further action.''</p>
        <p>If the Fed were to buck the conventional wisdom and raise rates this week, it would probably be in part because of a desire to keep the financial markets from rallying and fueling a rebound in growth. Analysts said the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee would probably deal with that matter by issuing a strongly worded statement about the continuing threat of inflation, putting investors on notice that further rate increases are possible, if not likely, starting in August.</p>
        <p>''They've got to talk tough,'' said Stephen D. Slifer, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. ''If they chose not to talk tough, the markets will think they are out of the picture, and if there was an incipient slowdown it would disappear pretty quick.''</p>
        <p>In both 1998 and 1999, the economy slowed substantially in the second quarter and then picked back up again to growth rates that fanned inflation fears among Fed officials.</p>
        <p>This year the economy grew at a 5.4 percent annual pace in the first quarter, and economists think it has slowed to an annual rate below 4 percent in the second quarter, which ends on Friday. There is some reason to think that this slowdown will last longer than its counterparts the last two years.</p>
        <p>For one thing, the Fed has tightened monetary policy substantially in the last year. Moreover, the slowdown appears to be spread more evenly across the economy. And higher oil prices relative to the last few years could damp spending by both corporations and consumers by making everything from a tank of gasoline to raw materials more expensive.</p>
        <p>Largely because of the acceleration in the growth rate of productivity, or output per hour, economists are increasingly convinced that the economy is capable of sharply higher rates of noninflationary growth than in the past.</p>
        <p>Only a few years ago, economists believed that the economy's noninflationary speed limit was annual growth of about 2.25 percent. Most estimates now put trend growth at around 4 percent, or about the estimated current rate of growth.</p>
        <p>But to project possible inflationary pressures, the speed limit, or ''trend'' growth rate, is often looked at in conjunction with the concept of a ''natural'' unemployment rate, or the jobless rate at which trend growth or higher will set off an inflationary cycle of wage and price increases.</p>
        <p>Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, does not put much stock in the natural unemployment rate concept, but some of his colleagues at the central bank do, most notably Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor. While some economists say the evidence suggests that the natural rate is now down to around 4 percent, Mr. Meyer puts it at 5 to 5.25 percent.</p>
        <p>If the economy is slowing, the debate at the Fed could turn to whether a combination of 3.5 to 4 percent growth and 4 percent unemployment will ignite any smoldering inflation pressures -- or whether the Fed should push growth down further, to a level that sends the unemployment rate back toward 5 percent.</p>
        <p>''The major question,'' Mr. Meyer said in a speech earlier this month, ''is whether slowing the economy to trend alone will get the job done or whether we need a period of below- trend growth to unwind an imbalance between the levels of aggregate demand and supply.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Meyer's concern is that inflation has been suppressed until now in part because of temporary factors that are likely to wear off, and that when they do, imbalances in the economy like the very tight labor market will again put upward pressure on wages and prices.</p>
        <p>When the temporary factors dissipate, Mr. Meyer said, ''not only will there be some rebound in inflation, but unless a transition is made back to sustainable utilization rates, there will be a risk of a continuous upward movement in inflation.''</p>
        <p>Translation: unemployment would have to rise back to the 5 percent level Mr. Meyer considers sustainable to ensure that inflation cannot get a foothold.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meyer puts more faith than many of his colleagues at the Fed in the idea that there are predictable tradeoffs between growth, unemployment and inflation. But he is far from alone among them in questioning whether the Fed might still have to turn the interest rate screws tighter later this year, even at the risk of taking political criticism as Election Day draws near.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan is widely viewed as being more open to the idea that the economy can sustain a combination of strong growth and low unemployment without inflation, largely because of his optimistic outlook about continuing improvements in productivity growth.</p>
        <p>Like a number of other Fed officials, Mr. Greenspan is likely to resist any calls for further rate increases on the basis of a theoretical relationship between growth, unemployment and inflation. He will probably be guided more by concrete evidence of how the economy develops in coming months.</p>
        <p>It is worth noting, however, that the two camps are not debating whether the economy needs to go into recession to wring out any chance of inflation, only whether it should slow to 4 percent or 3 percent, still a healthy performance, or, at worst, 2 percent.</p>
