        <p>A veteran police officer was suspended early yesterday morning for failing to assist a teenager who told her he had been sexually abused in Greenwich Village after the annual Gay and Lesbian Pride March, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The immediate suspension of the officer, Donna Gaudino, came as the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau was completing its investigation into reports that officers had failed to help women who said they were attacked in Central Park after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on June 11. This latest incident was different in that the teenager making the complaint immediately pointed out Officer Gaudino.</p>
        <p>The teenager, a Bronx resident, said he was groped by a 250-pound man at 9 p.m. Sunday in front of the Dugout Bar at 185 Christopher Street. The attack occurred after the march in an area where a crowd had gathered and police officers were standing watch. The Bronx youth, who is 17, said the man forced his hand inside the teenager's pants and grabbed his buttocks.</p>
        <p>The teenager told investigators that he reported the assault to Officer Gaudino, who refused to take a police report and said: ''We can't do anything about it. Nothing is going to happen to him anyway.''</p>
        <p>The teenager then found two other officers nearby who helped him. By the time they searched the area, the assailant could not be found, the police said.</p>
        <p>Lt. Sean Crowley, a police spokesman, said Officer Gaudino was suspended at 2:35 a.m. yesterday for failure to take proper police action, a serious charge that, if proven true, could result in her dismissal from the department.</p>
        <p>Typically, the police said, an officer would take a report from a victim and then search the area for the suspect or witnesses. Officer Gaudino did neither, according to the victim's account to investigators. ''At the very least, she should have taken a complaint report,'' Lieutenant Crowley said.</p>
        <p>Marty Algaze, a spokesman for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, said the Police Department had taken a major step by investigating the teenager's complaint.</p>
        <p>''The department should be applauded,'' Mr. Algaze said. ''The fact is that the police are taking this seriously, as opposed to saying, 'Oh, it's just a complaint from some guy at the gay parade.' ''</p>
        <p>Stuart London, a partner in Worth, Longworth, Bamundo &amp; London, the law firm representing the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said he planned to meet with Officer Gaudino soon but had not yet heard her account of the incident. ''We are in the process of doing our own investigation, so it is premature for us to comment on the propriety of the allegation,'' Mr. London said.</p>
        <p>Patrick J. Lynch, the police union's president, issued a statement saying Officer Gaudino's actions had been proper and that she was the victim of ''a politically charged atmosphere resulting from the recent Central Park incidents.''</p>
        <p>''We are defending her wholeheartedly,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''We are certain that when her side of the story is fully known she will be completely vindicated.'' His statement did not elaborate on the officer's version of the events, and he did not respond to a telephone message last night.</p>
        <p>Under department policies, officers facing administrative charges can be suspended for up to 30 days while internal affairs investigators review the case. Suspended officers are not paid for the work they miss, although they can be paid retroactively if the charges against them are determined to be unfounded.</p>
        <p>Officer Gaudino, 40, joined the department in 1990.</p>
        <p>There was one other report of sexual abuse during or after the parade, the police said. Overall, the authorities said, the march generated a typical amount of police work for a large summer parade: 13 arrests and 553 summonses issued for offenses like disorderly conduct and possession of marijuana.</p>
        <p>Officer Gaudino was suspended at a time when the Police Department has been heavily criticized for its response to the attacks by groups of men on at least 53 women in Central Park after the Puerto Rican Day Parade. At least two women have said that after they were groped by groups of men, they ran to nearby police officers, who all but ignored them.</p>
        <p>The Police Department has been investigating the allegations of police passivity during the Central Park attacks for two weeks. Unlike the case against Officer Gaudino, in which the teenager pointed her out immediately on the scene, the department had to review who was on duty after the previous parade and determine which officers may have been involved.</p>
        <p>The Central Park investigation is expected to be complete by the end of the week. A senior police official said yesterday that two officers would probably face administrative charges of failure to take police action, the same charge leveled against Officer Gaudino. Two others will probably face command discipline, less severe sanctions brought by their commander that can carry a punishment of the loss of as many as 10 vacation days. Such sanctions are expunged from the officers' personnel records after a year.</p>
        <p>The investigation is also focusing on the roles of police supervisors, the official said.</p>
        <p>''We'll be taking it up the chain of command to see how far it goes,'' the official said.</p>
