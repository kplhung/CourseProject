        <p>Dimpled and curly-haired with an ingenuous smile, Boy Scout manners and a polished vocal delivery that slides comfortably between theatrical belting and intimate pop crooning, Kane Alexander, a 23-year-old Australian singer, exudes a perky professionalism that is slightly unnerving coming from one so young.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alexander, who is appearing irregularly at the Firebird Cafe through Aug. 6, is the latest Australian import to arrive in New York under the wing of Les Solomon, the impresario who brought David Campbell to the United States. Like Mr. Campbell, who recently starred in the Second Stage production of ''Saturday Night,'' Mr. Alexander radiates the gee-whiz enthusiasm of a singing Ken doll that has just popped out of its shrink wrap with a glistening dewy-eyed grin and a song in its heart.</p>

        <p>Dimpled and curly-haired with an ingenuous smile, Boy Scout manners and a polished vocal delivery that slides comfortably between theatrical belting and intimate pop crooning, Kane Alexander, a 23-year-old Australian singer, exudes a perky professionalism that is slightly unnerving coming from one so young.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alexander, who is appearing irregularly at the Firebird Cafe through Aug. 6, is the latest Australian import to arrive in New York under the wing of Les Solomon, the impresario who brought David Campbell to the United States. Like Mr. Campbell, who recently starred in the Second Stage production of ''Saturday Night,'' Mr. Alexander radiates the gee-whiz enthusiasm of a singing Ken doll that has just popped out of its shrink wrap with a glistening dewy-eyed grin and a song in its heart.</p>
        <p>The patter and the songs (an engaging mixture of Australian show tunes and American popular standards) in Mr. Alexander's act tell the story of his show business odyssey from a tiny outback town (population 40) to the big city and the coveted role of Marius in an Australian production of ''Les Miserables.'' And now, gosh, here he is in the Big Apple with its wonderful ethnic food (at Saturday's early show he rhapsodized over the knishes and matzo-ball soup at the Second Avenue Deli).</p>
        <p>Mr. Alexander's polish wouldn't carry him far if his native charm and solid vocal ability weren't evident in everything he sings, from a goofy Australian show tune, ''Jindyworroback,'' to a ringing ''Do You Hear the People Sing?'' (from ''Les Miz''). If he is still too young to invest mature ballads of regret like ''There's Always One You Can't Forget'' and ''This Nearly Was Mine'' with much emotional resonance, he handled even these formidable ballads with delicacy and insight.</p>
