        <p>Given the customary abstraction of contemporary dance, it is easy to see the metaphor behind Jiri Kylian's use of bridges as the theme of his show celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Nederlands Dans Theater and his own 25 years as the company's principal choreographer. ''We have always tried to build bridges,'' he explained, ''bridges between people, races, nations, continents.''</p>
        <p>But for this show, ''Arcimboldo 2000,'' which is touring eight European cities this spring and summer, the Czech-born choreographer has done more than use bridges as symbols. He has also built real bridges from the stage over the orchestra pit into the audience. And, significantly, these are bridges crossed by both the performers and the public. Here, at least, there is no curtain separating illusion and reality.</p>

        <p>Given the customary abstraction of contemporary dance, it is easy to see the metaphor behind Jiri Kylian's use of bridges as the theme of his show celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Nederlands Dans Theater and his own 25 years as the company's principal choreographer. ''We have always tried to build bridges,'' he explained, ''bridges between people, races, nations, continents.''</p>
        <p>But for this show, ''Arcimboldo 2000,'' which is touring eight European cities this spring and summer, the Czech-born choreographer has done more than use bridges as symbols. He has also built real bridges from the stage over the orchestra pit into the audience. And, significantly, these are bridges crossed by both the performers and the public. Here, at least, there is no curtain separating illusion and reality.</p>
        <p>Before the show, spectators encounter video cameras recording their arrival, with the scenes replayed on a screen onstage. They are then guided behind and below the stage to discover a score of dancers, bedecked in feathers, moving in slow motion and hidden in odd places, like spirits who people the darkened theater.</p>
        <p>Finally, visitors arrive on stage and cross the bridges into the theater to take their seats. Once the show begins, it is the dancers' turn to go in the opposite direction, popping up in the audience before crossing onto the stage.</p>
        <p>''We're all in one boat, under the same roof,'' said Mr. Kylian, 53, who gave up the administrative duties of artistic director of the company last fall to concentrate entirely on choreography. ''The public becomes performers too. The whole idea is to include everyone in the fun. It's all about entertainment, it's a feast, a big multicolored gateau, a mosaic. That's why I thought Arcimboldo would be an appropriate title.''</p>
        <p>Best known as the 16th century painter who created bizarre portraits using fruits and vegetables, Giuseppe Arcimboldo was also Master of Ceremonies at the court of Rudolph II in Prague and, as such, had the job of organizing banquets, tournaments, fireworks displays and other assorted fun and games. Appropriately, after ''Arcimboldo 2000'' opened in The Hague in May, it traveled first to Prague. Recently it Paris, and it ends its tour at the Edinburgh Festival in September.</p>
        <p>It is the spirit of Arcimboldo, rather than his fruits and vegetables, that sets the mood of the show, a potpourri of sequences that include some pieces in the company's repertory and others created for the occasion. To keep the tone festive, the accompanying music is a cheerful medley of extracts from works by Tchaikovsky, Steve Reich, Aare Merikanto, Morton Feldman, John Cage, Bach, Schubert and others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kylian has designed the spectacle to display the multiple talents of the company. So five dancers have also created works: Jorma Elo made the video recordings of spectators and performers before the show; Karine Guizzo conceived and organized the backstage mise-en-scene; and Johan Inger, Patrick Delcroix and Paul Lightfoot created their own choreographies. Only 40 percent of the first half of the evening is signed by Mr. Kylian, although most of the second half is his.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the company's three troupes, which frequently tour separately, are now in the same show and, for the finale, dance as one ensemble: the 28 dancers of NDT1, the main troupe, founded in 1959: the 16 members of NDT2, formed in 1979 for dancers 17 to 22 (many graduate to NDT1); and the four ''seniors'' of NDT3, which Mr. Kylian created in 1989 to allow them to keep dancing ''between 40 and death,'' as he put it.</p>
        <p>Clearly Mr. Kylian has a soft spot for NDT3 -- and not only because it includes his German-born wife, Sabine Kupferberg. In fact, ''Arcimboldo 2000'' opens with Gerard Lemaitre, the 63-year-old French dean of the company, who is soon joined by Ms. Kupferberg, 49, David Krugel, 41, and Gioconda Barbuto, 43. They take their seats at a table and, as other dancers spin around them, do a comic turn spoofing the solemnity of dance auditions.</p>
        <p>In ''A Way a Lone: To Somebody No Longer Here,'' a piece by Mr. Kylian that was performed at last year's Lincoln Center Festival, Mr. Lemaitre, Mr. Krugel and Ms. Kupferberg become contemporary clowns in a clever interplay between dancers on screen and onstage. At the end of the show, after all the dancers have performed a splashy finale decked out in bright red costumes, it is again the NDT3 four who complete the cycle by wiping off their makeup.</p>
        <p>''With NDT3, it's not about what they cannot do, but what they can do better than the others,'' Mr. Kylian explained in an interview before ''Arcimboldo 2000'' was presented at the Palais Garnier in Paris this month. ''They can stand onstage and do nothing. Their energies are very different. Many old dancers are still performing around the world but they are pretending to be 30. I think they should dance their age and experience.''</p>
        <p>He said that since the choreography was designed for each member of NDT3, there was no question of a second cast. ''With the young, I'm more like a teacher,'' he went on, ''and the work is less linked to their personality. Young dancers injure themselves very easily because they don't yet know how to handle their bodies. NDT3 has only four dancers but they know their bodies, their limitations.''</p>
        <p>That said, the younger dancers provide much flair, as in Mr. Inger's sequence, ''Modern Furies,'' where five women appear in leather jackets, high heels and dark glasses as mafia molls, and Mr. Delcroix's ''Strange Animals,'' in which 18 dancers interact in green costumes that give them the appearance of insects. As always with the Nederlands Dans Theater, stunning costumes are very much part of the show, in this case designed by Joke Visser and Yoshiki Hishinuma, who began his career working with Issey Miyake.</p>
        <p>In an interview a year ago, Mr. Kylian said: ''Every piece should give you something to take home with you.'' In this case, he said, ''Arcimboldo 2000'' is intended specifically as ''a present to our public,'' a party from which the guests take home a gift. Indeed, the choreographer has come up with a pun to explain what he is up to: ''Yesterday is history, tomorrow is mystery, but today is a gift; that is why we call it the present.''</p>
