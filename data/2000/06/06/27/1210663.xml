        <p>OMERTA  By Mario Puzo  316 pages. Random House. $25.95.</p>
        <p>Like I was tellin' my shrink, I been thinkin' the best is over. When I got into this business, the glory days -- you know, the golden age -- was already history. Nowadays, everybody -- includin' me, I gotta admit -- is confessin' and complainin' and spillin' their guts, if not to one of the feds than to Sally Jessy Raphael or their psychiatrist. Any way you look at it, things are trendin' downward -- no one's got the stomach for the old standards anymore. Omerta? The code of silence? Fuhgeddaboudit.</p>
        <p>No doubt you're thinking this is Tony Soprano's own negativity speaking, but now a personage no less than the late great Mario Puzo -- the guy who created ''The Godfather,'' may he rest in peace -- confirms my worst suspicions. He's written this new book, Puzo has -- this book, ''Omerta'' -- and in it he comes out and lays it on the line. ''The old Mafia was dead,'' he writes. ''The great dons had accomplished their goals and blended gracefully into society, as the best criminals always do. The few pretenders who remained were a disappointing assortment of dim, second-class felons and impotent thugs.''</p>
        <p>Impotent thugs? Now I tell myself you can't take this personal, but you gotta wonder where a book like this leaves guys like me and my crew. Can we help it that we're living in a world of degenerate scum? That the RICO laws and the press make it hard for a guy to make a living? That we don't got the fancy international connections Puzo's characters do?</p>
        <p>Fact is, the more I think about it, the more this book gives me agita. God forbid that I should criticize the author of the great ''GF,'' but I gotta be honest with you: the man has lost his touch. Most of his wiseguys in this book aren't even wiseguys -- they're rich banker types, who wonder why anyone would ''want to bother with the rackets when it was much easier to steal millions by starting your own company and selling shares to the public.'' Even the hero of the book -- who's supposed to be this stand-up, old school mafioso -- rides around Westchester on a horse, all got up like some English lord in a red hunting jacket and black suede hat.</p>
        <p>And then there's something fishy about the details. Puzo's got Zabar's sitting on the East Side of Manhattan, and he's got these two soldiers whacking a guy -- putting a moonroof in the head of this former New York don -- in front of St. Patrick's  and then speedin' away in a getaway car. You think you can speed anywhere in midtown Manhattan with all that traffic? If you believe that, you believe me and Pussy can run a four-minute mile.</p>
        <p>O.K., so what's this ''Omerta'' about? I been gettin' to that. It's about this don Aprile -- no relation to Richie, please God -- who's decided to retire. This don's been a man among men, ''a throwback,'' Puzo calls him, ''to the old Sicilians of the 19th century who ruled towns and villages with their personal charisma, their sense of honor and their deadly and final judgment of any suspected enemy.''</p>
        <p>Anyway, this don finally decides to retire: he's gonna go legit. He divvies up his empire to grease things with his enemies and pay tribute to his old friends and he makes a bunch of donations to good causes. He's happy that his kids are civilians, that he's protected them from the business aspect of his life. One son's some sort of big shot in the U.S. Army, the other son's a bigwig at a TV network and his daughter's this hotshot lawyer. Just the kind of kids I'd be happy for A. J. and my Meadow to turn out to be.</p>
        <p>But just as the old don is settlin' in to enjoy the good life, bam, he gets popped at his grandkid's confirmation service. It's not his civilian kids who are gonna avenge him, but his adopted son, Astorre, this Sicilian boy he took in the same way Don Corleone took in Tom Hagen. Except, Astorre's no Tom Hagen. It turns out that the kid -- him with the red hunting jacket -- was actually trained in Sicily to be a traditional mafioso. It's too complicated to get into. Let's just say Astorre is so dedicated to Don Aprile's family that he's willin' to donate his own kneecaps to protect 'em.</p>
        <p>So Astorre starts lookin' into who ordered the hit on the don, and he finds this conspiracy like you wouldn't believe. It involves a rival don who's a stone cold whack-a-doo; this F.B.I. agent who acts like he's the  Michelangelo of G-men; these two crooked cops who've been on the take; and this fat pig of a drug dealer, who -- get this -- is trying to get his mitts on the A-bomb to protect his business in South America. Jeez, it's like something outta Oliver Stone.</p>
        <p>Far be it for me to be knockin' the great Mario Puzo, but I gotta say, I'm not particularly partial to this book. What's he know about nuclear weapons and how this international banking stuff goes down? Why don't he stick more to stuff he knows? Irregardless of the respect I got for Mr. Puzo, I gotta wonder why he don't get the kumquats outta his mouth and just get to the point. What was his people thinkin' bringing out a book like this after he died? Not good for the legend of the great creator of the great ''GF'' -- may he rest in peace. There, I said what I hadda say. End of story.</p>
