        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>IRAN: EDITOR SPURNS TRIBUNAL  The head of a reformist daily banned by a religious court is refusing to appear before the tribunal, the Tehran daily Abrar said. The paper said Ali-Akbar Mohtashemi, an adviser to President Mohammad Khatami and director of the newspaper Bayan, rejected the competence of the Special Court for Clergy. Mr. Mohtashemi, a former interior minister, has already failed to appear before the court and has been summoned again, Abrar said.</p>

        <p>IRAN: P.O.W RELEASE  Iran is to release 450 Iraqi prisoners of war within the next few days, 12 years after the conflict between the two countries ended, newspapers reported. The daily Iran quoted Brig. Gen. Mohammad Balar as saying the Iraqis would be freed as part of a recent accord with the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>

        <p>IRAN: DISSIDENT JAILED  A hard-line court ordered a leading dissident imprisoned, continuing its crackdown on journalists and reformists demanding greater freedoms. Ezatollah Sahabi, left, the editor of a magazine among 19 pro-democracy publications banned since April, was reportedly detained in connection with a conference he attended in Berlin. Several journalists and activists were arrested or jailed after returning from the April conference, at which some delegates criticized Iran's government. Several have been freed, but Akbar Ganji, a leading journalist, remains in prison.</p>

        <p>JORDAN: HAMAS PLEA DISMISSED  Jordan's highest court dismissed an appeal by four exiled anti-Israel militants to come home, a defense lawyer said. Emad Armouti, a member of the 150-member team defending the four Jordanian leaders of the group Hamas, said the decision was made on minor procedural grounds, was clearly political and would be appealed. The government, saying the four were engaged in illegal activities, sent them to Qatar last November, closed Hamas offices in Jordan and barred Hamas activities in the kingdom.</p>

        <p>UNITED NATIONS</p>
        <p>POVERTY ON RISE  The number of people living on less than a dollar a day is rising, the United Nations General Assembly was told as it began a weeklong meeting in Geneva to examine poverty. Since 1995 those living in absolute poverty has grown to 1.2 billion from about 1 billion, according to United Nations figures. The United Nations, the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Monetary Fund issued a report detailing poverty's spread and urging measures to halve the proportion of those living in poverty by 2015.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: STATE OF EMERGENCY  President Abdurrahman Wahid declared a civil state of emergency in the eastern islands of Maluku, where violence between Christians and Muslims has killed scores of people in the last week and thousands over the last 18 months. ''The situation is out of control,'' he said. Protesters at the American Embassy in Jakarta, above, called for international peacekeepers to be sent to the islands.</p>

        <p>KASHMIR: AUTONOMY PLAN APPROVED  The Jammu and Kashmir state provincial assembly approved a contentious resolution for greater autonomy that seeks to end political discontent in the region. The resolution provides restoration of pre-1953 relations between the federal and state government under which the federal government will control defense, foreign affairs and communications. Members of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which leads the federal coalition government, walked out in protest.</p>

        <p>SOUTH KOREA: DOCTORS BACK AT WORK  Doctors returned to work, ending a six-day strike that paralyzed medical services. The Korea Medical Association, a lobby for the nation's 65,000 doctors, called off the walkout after members voted to reopen their clinics and hospitals. The vote was called after political parties agreed to accept one of the key demands by doctors: new legislation to give them more authority to prescribe drugs, a major source of income.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>IRELAND: HAUGHEY TRIAL PUT OFF  A Dublin court indefinitely postponed the criminal trial of former Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey, 74, ruling that Mr. Haughey, who faces charges of obstructing a 1997 government inquiry, could not receive a fair trial because of a rash of negative publicity from politicians and the press. In a newspaper interview, Deputy Prime Minister Mary Harney said Mr. Haughey should be convicted, and posters throughout Dublin display his face under the slogan ''Jail the corrupt politicians.''</p>

        <p>FRANCE: AIR CONTROLLERS STRIKE  French air traffic controllers went on strike to protest privatization, paralyzing flights in and out of France and affecting all of the country's airlines and airports. Up to 90 percent of flights were expected to be canceled at the height of the 24-hour strike, according to the General Direction for Civil Aviation. The state-run train authority said it provided 5,000 extra seats over the weekend to help compensate for canceled flights. The air traffic controllers were protesting what they say are plans by the European Union to privatize the industry.</p>

        <p>AZERBAIJAN: 65 GET AMNESTY  President Heydar Aliyev has granted amnesty to 65 people said to have taken part in attempted coups in 1994 and 1995. Officials say all those released were tried and sentenced justly under Azerbaijani law. But the Helsinki Citizens Assembly said more than half of the prisoners did not receive fair trials and their amnesty is an attempt to gain favor with the Council of Europe, Europe's main human rights body. The council is expected to vote on admitting Azerbaijan and Armenia tomorrow.</p>

        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: 5 FACE MILOSEVIC TRIAL  Five men accused of plotting to assassinate President Slobodan Milosevic under French orders were scheduled to go on trial in Belgrade today. The five, all Serbs from Yugoslavia and Bosnia, were accused of devising four different plans to kill Mr. Milosevic, including a sniper attack, a bomb placed in a gutter, a booby-trapped car and an armed raid on his residence. The accused were arrested last November.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CANADA: U.S. ENVOY'S NEW JOB  Raymond A. J. Chretien, Canada's Ambassador to Washington since 1994, has been chosen as Ambassador to France. The switch comes less than a month after the press interpreted a speech by Mr. Chretien as an implicit endorsement of Vice President Gore in the American presidential race. Aides to the ambassador said he was merely assessing the two American candidates' familiarity with Canada. Mr. Chretien, a career diplomat, is a nephew of Prime Minister Jean Chretien.</p>

        <p>CONGO: PLEA TO U.N. COURT  Congo asked the United Nations' International Court of Justice in The Hague to rule that Uganda must withdraw its forces from Congolese territory. Congo filed cases against Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda last year, accusing them of armed aggression and ''massive violations of human rights.'' In written statements, Congo said ''despite promises and declarations'' Uganda has pursued its policy of ''aggression, its brutal armed interventions, its harassment and its looting.''</p>
