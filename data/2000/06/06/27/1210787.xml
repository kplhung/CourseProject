        <p>After the drownings of a mother and daughter off Rockaway Beach on Sunday, the Parks Department assigned rangers yesterday to patrol two of its beaches in the early evening to keep people out of dangerous waters after lifeguards go off duty at 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>Four rangers are being assigned to Rockaway Beach in Queens and two to Coney Island Beach in Brooklyn, to patrol from 6 p.m. until dark, said Henry J. Stern, the parks commissioner.</p>
        <p>But there is only so much the city can do, he said, noting that Rockaway Beach, which includes nearly half the city's public beachfront, is seven miles long. ''If people want to go in, they go when the vehicles pass by,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Most people obey when the lifeguards blow their whistles at 6 p.m. and use megaphones to order everyone out of the water, said Robert Lawson, a parks spokesman. ''But once the lifeguards leave, people can go back into the water,'' he said.  ''They're not allowed to, but it happens. It's not 'swim at your own risk.' It's 'keep out of the water.' It's very dangerous.''</p>
        <p>On Sunday evening, an hour and a half after Rockaway Beach in Queens closed, Mercedes Segura, 40, of the Inwood section of Manhattan,  and her 6-year-old daughter, Carivad Munoz, drowned, the police said. Two others were injured in the incident. Ms. Segura's niece, Rita Vega, 9, was  in stable condition last night at St. John's Hospital, and a firefighter, Brian Gallagher, has been released from the hospital.</p>
        <p>The deaths highlighted the danger of the summertime lure of beaches after hours. Most drownings occur when lifeguards are off duty, parks officials said. Of the three people drowned in New York City beaches last year, one died after the lifeguards left for the evening and another before they started work at 10 a.m.</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon, the lifeguards had no trouble clearing Rockaway Beach at 6 p.m. High winds -- blowing at 25 knots -- had stirred up a sandstorm, and by midafternoon, most people had left. The water at Rockaway Beach tends to be fairly rough, and the high winds would have raised strong waves and created a powerful undertow, said Petty Officer Mark Guiteras of the United States Coast Guard.</p>
        <p>The city's primary means of keeping people out of the water before 10 a.m. and after 6 p.m. is signs. Most are red with white lettering, about two feet by a foot and a half, and say, ''Swimming prohibited when lifeguard not on duty,'' or some variation. They are posted on boardwalks, on ramp railings, on light poles and sometimes on the backs of vacant lifeguard chairs.</p>
        <p>''As you know,'' a parks supervisor said, ''we're not shy with signs.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, there has been a shortage of lifeguards in New York City, and at times, some spots of beachfront have had to close because there were no guards for them. But this year, the city has hired more than 1,000 lifeguards, which is enough to staff all the public pools and beaches during posted hours,  Mr. Stern said.</p>
        <p>Most lifeguards are recruited from high school and college swimming teams, though some are teachers. Lifeguards are responsible for keeping swimmers within a safe range, and yesterday, in the heavy surf, they were asking the few people in the water to stay especially close to the shore, Mr. Lawson said.</p>
