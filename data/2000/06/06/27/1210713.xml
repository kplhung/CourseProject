        <p>Just when many seemed ready to begin writing off Japan's democracy as hopelessly moribund, the huge advance made on Sunday by an opposition party once seen as hapless has awakened the country to the possibility of political change.</p>
        <p>Japan's Democratic Party overcame discouraging opinion polls, bad weather and an electorate often seen as apathetic to emerge from parliamentary elections as a solid challenger to the Liberal Democratic Party, which has held power almost without interruption since the 1950's.</p>
        <p>As a result, Japanese political analysts describe the weeks ahead as completely uncharted -- a highly unusual situation in a country where politics usually seem carefully scripted. What seems certain is that despite morning-after headlines here that strangely spoke of a vote for continuity, more change -- perhaps dramatic change -- is on its way.</p>
        <p>Despite party denials that Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori would be removed any time soon, the catastrophically loose-tongued leader who oversaw the Liberal Democratic Party's debacle is already being spoken of in some quarters in the past tense.</p>
        <p>''What happens next very much depends upon whether Mr. Mori remains in office after the G-8 Summit,'' said Hidekazu Kawai, a professor of comparative politics at Gakushuin University in Tokyo. ''I believe that he is already on the road toward what we call an honorable retirement. But if he does not retire, strife within the L.D.P. will only become stronger, because people will be afraid to fight another election under his leadership.'' Japan's next parliamentary election, an Upper House vote, is due next year.</p>
        <p>The Japanese government has been gearing up for a full year to host leaders of the Group of 7 major industrialized nations and Russia. According to this view, Mr. Mori's success as a host of the event will serve as a dignified occasion to bow out.</p>
        <p>But the Liberal Democrats have far more to worry about than a feckless prime minister who needlessly provoked independent voters by urging them to ''just stay in bed'' on Election Day rather than play havoc with his encouraging poll numbers.</p>
        <p>The largely unheralded story of the last decade or so has, in fact, been the creeping demise of a party that has been in power so long that analysts must reach for comparisons to a place like China, rather than the Western democracies, for parallels.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, the Liberal Democratic Party governed easily with its comfortable parliamentary majority, stifling debate and co-opting other parties with budgetary sweets to secure their added support as needed. The party suffered a momentary setback -- its only loss of power -- in 1993, when Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of a small reformist party, formed a brief-lived government.</p>
        <p>Since then, the Liberal Democrats have been back in power, firmly at first, but less comfortably with every passing election, as the number of independent voters has increased, and as their support has tilted toward opposition candidates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mori's predecessor, the late Keizo Obuchi, achieved a large ruling majority only by forming a controversial and awkward coalition, bringing together a pacifist, Buddhist-backed party that favors social spending, New Komeito, with the Liberals, a hawkish, Thatcherite party.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of the vote on Sunday, the Liberal Democrats are left with their awkward allies, and are hobbled with a weak coalition that even together holds only a slim majority.</p>
        <p>Many factors seem to have contributed to the ruling party's fading hold on the electorate. For one, urban voters in particular seem to have grown disgusted with the government's free spending in rural areas. Endless projects like ultramodern airports for small farming prefectures and an ever-expanding but money-losing bullet train network, have cost Japan a half trillion dollars during two years.</p>
        <p>Such projects are justified in the name of pump priming to keep the country's economy afloat -- and that barely, after a decade of decline. But voters, particularly urban voters, seem to have caught onto the game and decided that this is really about nothing more than buying the support of the countryside for the Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>''I have the impression that Japan is a country divided in two, a rural and an urban country,'' said Yoichi Masuzoe, an independent who unsuccessfully ran for governor of Tokyo. ''In the capital, and in other urban areas, L.D.P. candidates lost, including many of its big names. Their traditional way of distributing money, in the name of public works, has only worked with rural voters. The salary man in Tokyo is more concerned about what is happening to the country, and they have shown their desire for change.</p>
        <p>''The question now is whether Japan will stick to a traditional, dirty way of handling matters, favoring the rural areas, or whether it is choosing a new way, a more open and rational policy-based approach. The next two years will tell, but I believe this is really a historic transition period.''</p>
        <p>If a major transition is under way, many people feel that the outcome will be a more stable two-party system, or at least a system involving two large, rival coalitions.</p>
        <p>Through its performance, the Democratic Party took a major step toward becoming a leader of one of those coalitions. And many analysts said the way that it did so bodes well for the future of Japanese politics.</p>
        <p>Rather than compete with the Liberal Democratic Party on the basis of seductive promises, the Democrats took the usual tack of warning voters that substantial pain lies ahead for Japan after years of overindulgence and drift.</p>
        <p>Most specifically, in a campaign that most often resembled a competition between poster hangers rather than a contest over ideas, the Democrats distinguished themselves by promising new taxes and specific spending cuts.</p>
        <p>Although few people are willing to credit the Democratic Party with having a full-blown platform on how to run the economy, or, many say, the maturity yet to govern, many analysts saluted this act of electoral courage as a sample of the kind of spine that will be needed to revive the country.</p>
