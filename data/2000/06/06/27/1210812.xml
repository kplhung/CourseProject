        <p>Melvin Mora is doing his best to make Steve Phillips's decision difficult. Phillips, the Mets' general manager, must decide whether Mora is a suitable shortstop for the rest of the season or if he should make a serious push for another team's starter.</p>

        <p>Melvin Mora is doing his best to make Steve Phillips's decision difficult. Phillips, the Mets' general manager, must decide whether Mora is a suitable shortstop for the rest of the season or if he should make a serious push for another team's starter.</p>
        <p>Mora has batted .304 with 3 homers, 11 runs batted in and 17 runs scored since Rey Ordonez was lost for the season on May 29. But the Mets have expressed interest in San Francisco's Rich Aurilia and Baltimore's Mike Bordick.</p>
        <p>The Giants are still in a pennant race and will probably wait until closer to the July 31 trading deadline before deciding whether to make a move, but the Orioles seem ready to deal. They are tied with Tampa Bay for the worst record in the American League (30-43) and have lost nine in a row.</p>
        <p>The Orioles had a scout at Class AAA Norfolk last night and were considering trading the starter Scott Erickson. Erickson, a 10-year veteran, earned five years of service time as an Oriole last night. He can now veto a trade.</p>
        <p>The Mets had a scout watching Erickson on Friday, and they have expressed some interest in him. Erickson has three years left on his contract at $6.5 million a year.</p>
        <p>Phillips did not acknowledge the Mets' interest in Erickson and would not comment on whether their position on him would change with his becoming a 10-and-5 player.</p>
        <p>But Erickson's agent, Rick Thurman, said last night that Erickson would approve a trade to the Mets. A potential deal for Erickson could be expanded to include Bordick, who can become a free agent this winter.</p>
        <p>The Mets have said they want to fill their holes from within, and in theory, Mora could answer the shortstop question if he continues to play well.</p>
        <p>Mora received a standing ovation at Shea Stadium last night after his homer in the seventh inning gave the Mets their final runs.</p>
        <p>''They don't see nothing yet,'' he said of his power, with a laugh. ''I'm not surprised because I've been working hard. I'm a line-drive hitter, but sometimes if they make a mistake and I crush the ball, I'm going to hit it out.''</p>
        <p>Mora's play has not changed the way Phillips views him.</p>
        <p>''We all form our evaluations based on what someone's done in the past, but those evaluations can be changed by what the player continues to show you,'' Phillips said. ''Nothing's changed in my evaluation of Mora since he started playing more at shortstop.</p>
        <p>''Our view all along is those guys have done an adequate job since Rey went down, both offensively and defensively. Unless someone of some significance becomes available to improve upon that, we probably wouldn't make a deal.''</p>
        <p>Phillips said the Mets' primary need continued to be pitching -- starting or relief, though the inconsistency of the bullpen is an increasing concern to some in the organization. But he also mentioned the outfield and shortstop as other needs.</p>
        <p>If the Mets are going to seriously pursue a shortstop, Mora doubts his play will dissuade them.</p>
        <p>''I don't put any pressure on myself,'' he said. ''I have to do well. Whatever they have mind, they're going to do it anyway. You can't change what the situation is going to be. You want to be in there, but nothing's going to stop them. You can continue to play great, and they might send you someplace.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I'm going to play left field -- I don't know. I can't control the future. What happens now, I can control that. If they bring a shortstop and they think the team would be better, that's good. I want to be part of that and win a championship.''</p>
        <p>Now that he is playing regularly, Mora said, he benefits from seeing pitchers more than once in a game. Mora does not draw many walks, but Manager Bobby Valentine said Mora was seeing more pitches and seemed more relaxed at the plate.</p>
        <p>''When you have that feeling, you can play with the ball,'' Mora said. ''The ball doesn't play with you.''</p>
        <p>Whether Mora gets the chance to keep that feeling may not be known until after the trading deadline. One thing Mora is certain of is his belief in his ability.</p>
        <p>''I feel confident with what I do and what I'm going to do,'' he said. ''I trust myself, and I know I'm going to hit and do a lot of things for my team. When I play, I'm going to do something.''</p>
