      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Hello again, everyone, this is Howard Cosell speaking of sports.</p>
        <p>Crude, vulgar, obnoxious, truculent, verbose, condescending, a wiseacre.</p>
        <p>There is no question that Dennis Miller is all of these things.</p>
        <p>Much has been written by print reporters, that seedy lot of hangers-on, about Miller, in essence, replacing me on ABC's ''Monday Night Football.''</p>
        <p>What a tribute to my palpable impact and how right I was for my times that I have been irreplaceable for 16 seasons. Would that young Dennis handle my halftime highlights, a historic demonstration of ad-libbing proficiency.</p>
        <p>Young Dennis is quite the mischievous monkey on his weekly HBO program. I watched it Friday night and I have rarely in my illustrious career, with my full knowledge of constitutional law, listened to somebody in greater need of a First Amendment defense lawyer. I don't blush easily, but young Dennis articulated vulgarities 18 times in a mere 30 minutes. Young Dennis informed viewers that ''golly'' will be his ''Monday Night'' code for a famous epithet.</p>
        <p>Not even the Danderoo ever took such reckless verbal risks.</p>
        <p>I have not been so appalled -- so horrified, so assaulted -- since Nov. 26, 1982 -- the Houston Astrodome -- when Larry Holmes brutalized -- even destroyed -- a defenseless and desperately untalented Randall (Tex) Cobb for 12 dehumanizing rounds.</p>
        <p>It is unsurprising to this reporter that Don Ohlmeyer, a man I greatly respect, turned to young Dennis to save ''Monday Night Football.'' But he doubtlessly got the idea from yours truly: in 1985, I wrote, with characteristic perspicacity, that the show needed a star, like Bill Cosby.</p>
        <p>We're dealing with football, an entertainment, not the canonization of a saint. I believe young Dennis and I share much, yet not enough. To his detriment.</p>
        <p>We each suffer from bad hair. For no apparent reason, he calls attention to his slovenly tresses by nervously running his hand through them. I dared not touch what I had, lest it move into unsuitable and unstylish hairlines.</p>
        <p>Young Dennis and I are alumni of ''Saturday Night Live.'' My version, on ABC, started before NBC's, yet it lasted but 22 weeks. You are indisputably aware of its auspicious start: the American debut of the Bay City Rollers.</p>
        <p>When I appeared as a guest on the NBC show, I dressed up as a relative of Ed Grimley, the transcendent nerd created by Martin Short. Dennis Miller merely emceed ''Weekend Update'' on that program, replacing, in essence, Chevy Chase.</p>
        <p>I, of course, never replaced anyone.</p>
        <p>I was, and continue to be, an original.</p>
        <p>To his credit, this young scamp works assiduously at being unlikable.</p>
        <p>I never toiled at it, such a skill coming naturally.</p>
        <p>He employs words like weaponry as I wielded words and thoughts like the jabs Ali threw before the United States government stripped him of his right to work.</p>
        <p>Young Dennis's intelligence is eclectic, even catholic, like mine. I can envision him hosting a show like my ''Speaking of Everything.'' His potty-mouthed show on Friday ranged from commentary on Bill Gates and the execution of the convicted Texas murderer Gary Graham to security leaks at Los Alamos.</p>
        <p>I confess to a modicum of shame at laughing when he remarked, ''It's always nice to know the doomsday machine is hooked up to a Clapper.''</p>
        <p>I also confess that this lad is quite the communicator. Like me, he possesses a rapport with young people, the type of skill that told me I was the right person to report to America that John Lennon had been assassinated.</p>
        <p>Yet, as someone for whom ''Monday Night'' is a distant and bad memory, I am concerned about whether young Dennis's penchant for baroque similes will work for an audience weaned on pedestrian analyses of X's and O's and an overdependence on scribbling with the Telestrator.</p>
        <p>Can a tackle by the insouciant defensive end Bruce Smith, long of the Buffalo Bills, now with the suddenly renascent Washington Redskins, be rightly compared to a ''choice between walking and hitching a ride with a bisexual trucker''? Will there be credibility to young Dennis describing the muddied nose of an offensive tackle as if it had ''inhaled Bob Marley feet first''?</p>
        <p>In the booth with Alfalfa Michaels, with whom I once called ''Monday Night Baseball,'' and Dan Fouts -- the newest recruit of manifest ordinariness from the Jockocracy, a substratum of ex-jocks and ex-coaches that does not respect the training required to be an effective broadcaster -- Miller will divide viewers between those who admire and those who abhor him.</p>
        <p>I have considerable expertise in this field, having once been voted the most loved and hated sportscaster, simultaneously, in a TV Guide poll.</p>
        <p>I made ''Monday Night.'' I was the one who gave it moment. Those who succeeded me -- Joe Willie Namath, The Juice, Dan Dierdorf, Boomer Esiason -- had their moments, too, but they occurred during the time of William of Orange.</p>
        <p>Yet I harbor some hope for young Dennis. He has none of my experience, yet if he can make viewers hate him, and organize screen-bashing keg parties to protest his most grotesque utterances, ratings will ascend accordingly.</p>
        <p>Many years ago, Jim Brown described Howard Cosell as a warrior, whose career could be measured by the caliber of his enemies.</p>
        <p>Young Dennis has much to shoot for.</p>
        <p>This is Howard Cosell.</p>
