        <p>The Supreme Court reaffirmed the Miranda decision today by a 7-to-2 vote that erased a shadow over one of the most famous rulings of modern times and acknowledged that the Miranda warnings ''have become part of our national culture.''</p>
        <p>The court said in an opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist that because the 1966 Miranda decision ''announced a constitutional rule,'' a statute by which Congress had sought to overrule the decision was itself unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>Miranda had appeared to be in jeopardy, both because of that long-ignored but recently rediscovered law, by which Congress had tried to overrule Miranda 32 years ago, and because of the court's perceived hostility to the original decision.</p>
        <p>The chief justice said, though, that the 1968 law, which replaced the Miranda warnings with a case-by-case test of whether a confession was voluntary, could be upheld only if the Supreme Court decided to overturn Miranda. But with Miranda having ''become embedded in routine police practice'' without causing any measurable difficulty for prosecutors, there was no justification for doing so, he said. [Excerpts, Page A18.]</p>
        <p>Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas cast the dissenting votes.</p>
        <p>The decision overturned a ruling last year by the federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., which held that Congress was entitled to the last word because Miranda's presumption that a confession was not voluntary unless preceded by the warnings was not required by the Constitution.</p>
        <p>The decision today -- only 14 pages long, in Chief Justice Rehnquist's typically spare style -- brought an abrupt end to one of the odder episodes in the court's recent history, an intense and strangely delayed refighting of a previous generation's battle over the rights of criminal suspects. Miranda v. Arizona was a hallmark of the Warren Court, and Chief Justice Rehnquist, despite his record as an early and tenacious critic of the decision, evidently did not want its repudiation to be an imprint of his own tenure.</p>
        <p>There was considerable drama in the courtroom today as the chief justice announced that he would deliver the decision in the case, Dickerson v. United States, No. 99-5525. The announcement meant that he was the majority opinion's author. Given his statements over more than 25 years about Miranda's lack of constitutional foundation, there was the distinct possibility that he was about to announce that Miranda had been overruled.</p>
        <p>The way Chief Justice Rehnquist chose to begin his announcement did little to clarify matters. ''You have the right to remain silent,'' he intoned in a firm voice, moving on to the other familiar warnings without further introduction. Some in the courtroom audience wondered whether they might be hearing these phrases as the official words of the court for the last time.</p>
        <p>By the time the chief justice finished delivering his opinion, there was no ringing endorsement of Miranda, but the message was clear: ''Whether or not we would agree with Miranda's reasoning and its resulting rule, were we addressing the issue in the first instance,'' he said, ''the principles of stare decisis weigh heavily against overruling it now.'' The Latin phrase ''stare decisis,'' meaning ''to stand by things decided,'' is the court's standard reference for the doctrine of adherence to precedent.</p>
        <p>Both in his courtroom announcement and in his written opinion, Chief Justice Rehnquist made only passing reference to a series of opinions throughout the 1970's, 80's and 90's suggesting that Miranda was not itself embedded directly in the Constitution but was rather just a ''prophylactic'' effort to protect the underlying Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination.</p>
        <p>One of his own early opinions, Michigan v. Tucker in 1974, said the ''procedural safeguards'' adopted in Miranda ''were not themselves rights protected by the Constitution'' -- a quotation that Justice Scalia flung back at the chief justice today in his bitter dissenting opinion. These post-Miranda decisions permitted prosecutors to use statements obtained in violation of Miranda to impeach a defendant's credibility or for other purposes beyond the prosecution's direct case.</p>
        <p>''These decisions illustrate the principle -- not that Miranda is not a constitutional rule -- but that no constitutional rule is immutable,'' the chief justice said, describing the ''modifications represented by these cases'' as ''a normal part of constitutional law.''</p>
        <p>In his stinging dissent, which Justice Thomas joined, Justice Scalia accused the majority of playing intellectually dishonest ''word games'' to justify going beyond the court's authority to apply the Constitution's commands.</p>
        <p>''Since there is in fact no other principle that can reconcile today's judgment with the post-Miranda cases that the court refuses to abandon,'' he wrote, ''what today's decision will stand for, whether the justices can bring themselves to say it or not, is the power of the Supreme court to write a prophylactic, extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress and the states.''</p>
        <p>The decision was a vindication for the Clinton administration, and particularly for Attorney General Janet Reno. In the face of opposition from parts of her law enforcement constituency within the Justice Department, she put the department on the side of an indicted bank robber in arguing that Miranda was a statement of constitutional law and that the 1968 statute, known as Section 3501, was not a valid exercise of Congressional authority.</p>
        <p>''Today's decision recognizes Miranda has been good for law enforcement,'' the attorney general said today, adding: ''Most importantly, it will continue to provide a public sense of fairness in our criminal justice system.''</p>
        <p>Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer joined the chief justice's majority opinion today. There were no separate concurring opinions, a rare expression of unanimity among the majority in a major case.</p>
        <p>As much as anything else, the decision reflected the court's deep suspicion, expressed in several recent decisions, of Congressional incursions into the realm of constitutional law-making, which the justices regard as reserved for the court alone.</p>
        <p>In this, the decision was reminiscent of the 1992 decision that reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion, joined by justices who might well not have voted for Roe v. Wade in 1973 as an original matter but who thought the court would weaken itself by repudiating the precedent.</p>
        <p>The validity of Section 3501 had not come before the court until now because no administration, of either party, sought to apply it. The law was injected into the case against Charles T. Dickerson, accused of participating in a 1997 bank robbery in Alexandria, Va., by a career federal prosecutor who asked the Federal District Court there to use the law to admit incriminating statements that Mr. Dickerson had given in the absence of Miranda warnings.</p>
        <p>The District Court refused, and the Justice Department would not permit Section 3501 to be pressed on appeal. A conservative legal organization here, the Washington Legal Foundation, won permission to make the argument as a friend of the court from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which admitted the confession and accused the department of abdicating its responsibility.</p>
