        <p>France offered an antidote today to some of the celebratory tone of the conference on democracy here that was spearheaded by the United States, saying that imposing democracy on a country could have the opposite result.</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France cited Fidel Castro and Saddam Hussein as examples of authoritarian leaders who had only been reinforced either by military force or economic sanctions.</p>
        <p>Further, he contended, while President Carter clearly did not intend to bring about the Islamic revolution in Iran, his policies had essentially helped bring about that result.</p>
        <p>Morton H. Halperin, chief of policy planning at the State Department, parried Mr. Vedrine's statements, saying that the conference was not about the ''export'' of democracy but about enabling countries that had ''chosen'' democracy to help one another.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vedrine spoke to the gathering in the chamber of the Polish Parliament after opening remarks by the host, Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek. Mr. Vedrine then went out of his way to brief American reporters on his thoughts about democracy and how his philosophy on democracy differed from what he saw as the themes for the conference.</p>
        <p>He was careful not to attack the particulars of the conference, saying he had nothing to do with its organization and had come at the express request of his friend, Mr. Geremek. He did not mention Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, whose conference this essentially is and who is seeking to make the theme of democracy the lodestar of her tenure.</p>
        <p>Instead of lending itself to easy converts, perhaps like religion, he said, democracy is ''always a process of evolution.'' And, he said, it overwhelmingly involves long maturing internal processes within nations such as in economics, the collective state of mind and -- in the end -- politics.</p>
        <p>Definitions aside, the French foreign minister appeared vexed about the appearance that developed democracies are lecturing others. Nobody, he suggested, has a magic formula for ''transforming Russia into a huge Finland, or China into a huge South Korea.''</p>
        <p>''Let's not be self-congratulatory,'' Mr. Vedrine added. ''Our democracies still have room for improvement.'' He singled out the role of money in influencing policy in developed democracies as ''terrifying'' and bemoaned the apathy of citizens.</p>
        <p>Representatives from more than 100 countries, including foreign ministers from many of them, are meeting here under the rubric ''Toward a Community of Democracies.'' The notion is to encourage deeper democracy in the world by having countries commit themselves to a set of principles laid out in what is being called the Warsaw Declaration.</p>
        <p>American officials have argued during the last few days that while the number of countries with democratic attributes has vastly increased -- by their count from 30 to 120 since 1974 -- much needs to be done to consolidate democratic gains in the weakest nations and stop backsliding in others.</p>
        <p>Countries that were judged by a seven-nation vetting committee to be at least aspiring to democratic standards were invited.</p>
        <p>The conference, whose formal sessions began today and will close Tuesday, is split into two entities: speeches and panels at the Parliament for government leaders and a parallel gathering of nongovernmental organizations in a building across town.</p>
        <p>Two prominent groups, the Washington-based Freedom House, and the Stefan Batory Foundation, which was founded in Poland by the financier George Soros, were asked by the State Department to organize the parallel meeting, featuring speeches  by human rights figures from around the world.</p>
        <p>State Department officials called the parallel meeting the World Forum on Democracy, seeming to echo the title of the annual conference at Davos, Switzerland, the World Economic Forum. And they said they hoped that the forum would take on a life of its own and become the equivalent of a ''Davos of Democracy.'' Leaders of some groups grumbled today that they found the comparison demeaning since they had been working on building democracy at the grass-roots level for many years.</p>
        <p>One of the emerging themes of the discussions today was the issue of national sovereignty, raised most frontally by Mr. Vedrine but also by others, who took a different approach.</p>
        <p>In a moving appeal on video, smuggled out of Burma and shown to the foreign ministers this morning, the Burmese dissident Daw Aung San Suu Kyi urged ''the peoples of the free world to work harder toward bringing true democratic progress everywhere.''</p>
        <p>She was not specific about what kind of action she wanted from the outside world, but she hinted that some kind of intervention was necessary. ''Words need to be backed up by action that is united and that is focused on essentials,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In one of his speeches, Mr. Geremek said that in ''normal situations'' there should be no collision between sovereignty on the one hand and human rights and democracy on the other. Nor, he said, did he anticipate that globalization would abolish the idea of the nation state.</p>
        <p>But in ''exceptional situations,'' which are ''not in fact so very exceptional,'' he said, human rights and democracy take precedence. One such example is when the state, instead of protecting its citizens, becomes a threat to them. In this and some other cases, the international community cannot stand by and watch, he said, and must say, ''It's human rights, stupid.''</p>
