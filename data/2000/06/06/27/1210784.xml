        <p>Six days a week, 12 hours a day, Jose Munez stands at a conveyor belt heaped  with trash and grabs aluminum cans. His hands move rapidly as he flips them into a pile. Grab and flip, grab and flip.</p>
        <p>Mr. Munez rescues the recyclables that New York City residents collect. At 65, he is probably the oldest and almost certainly the most enthusiastic sorter at his recycling plant in Bushwick, Brooklyn. It is a cavernous, cacophonous building, the size of two city blocks, filled with 20-foot-high stacks of compressed metal and plastic and paper blocks.</p>
        <p>''I want to keep working in my spot until God decides,'' shouted Mr. Munez, who like most of his co-workers is an immigrant. ''I like to be in the action. I like it fast. The more they throw, the happier I am.''</p>
        <p>In New York City, people throw plenty. Every day at the Brooklyn plant, the city dumps about 400 tons of metal, glass, paper and plastic, or 20 percent of the daily collection of recyclables. The plant is owned by Browning-Ferris Industries, the huge waste collection company that recently won the 20-year contract to handle most of the city's garbage when Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island closes next year.</p>
        <p>The BFI recycling plant in Bushwick is one of about 10 recycling plants serving the city. Some items can be salvaged mechanically: a strong six-foot-wide magnet lifts out some metal cans, and glass is smashed into fine particles in a rotating cylinder and sifted through holes in it. But most of the recyclables must be removed and sorted the old-fashioned way -- by hand.</p>
        <p>Not that there are no alternatives. The most common one is to require residents to sort their own trash, as is done in much of suburban Westchester County and in New Jersey. Residents in many towns sort things into as many as 12 different piles -- not just glass, for instance, but brown glass, green glass and clear glass. Not just plastic, but HDPE, PET and PVC, abbreviations for polysyllabic names.</p>
        <p>More items, of better quality, can be salvaged this way, fetching higher prices; and the recyclables can be sold directly to the manufacturer, eliminating the need and expense of a recycling plant.</p>
        <p>But New York City residents are asked to make only two bundles: one for paper, including cardboard and newsprint, and one for metal, glass and plastic, including plastic milk and juice cartons.</p>
        <p>When the city adopted recycling 11 years ago, the feeling was that it was impractical to ask New Yorkers, with their tight living spaces, to sort their trash into 8 or 10 piles. And the cost of extra sanitation trucks and drivers to pick up all the various kinds of trash could double the already high cost of recycling, said Steven W. Lawitts, a deputy sanitation commissioner.</p>
        <p>''They made the decision long ago that it would be too much to ask of New Yorkers,'' said Bradley Cohen, a co-chairman of the Citywide Recycling Advisory Board, a legally mandated volunteer organization that consults with New York City's recycling department.</p>
        <p>The other system is unquestionably superior, he says, but changing now would be as impractical as changing to the metric system of measurement. ''We made our bed,'' he said, ''and we have to sleep on it.''</p>
        <p>The task of sorting trash has fallen to a legion of low-paid workers, including a high percentage of immigrants. At the Browning-Ferris center, nearly all the 195 trash pickers are recent immigrants, said Russ Kruk, the manager. A majority are from Central America, Africa or the Dominican Republic, which is Mr. Munez's homeland. They manage to support relatives from their old countries as well as their families here by regularly working overtime.</p>
        <p>Adam Ba, 31, from Senegal, who sorts cardboard, sends $500 a month to his family: father, his father's three wives and their children, his sister and his grandfather.</p>
        <p>''It's sometimes boring and sometimes dangerous,'' Mr. Ba said. ''But we get benefits, and that is good.''</p>
        <p>Pickers start at $7.50 an hour and they routinely work 16 to 20 hours of overtime, which comes to about $500 a week before taxes. While Mr. Munez is enthusiastic about the work, most pickers seem to agree with Mr. Ba: sorting trash is dull and tiring. Nevertheless, many neighbors and relatives of workers have also accepted jobs at the plant because of the regular hours, the security of a union job and, especially, the benefits and paid vacations, which few unskilled jobs include.</p>
        <p>The men -- for they are all men, though some women work at other recycling plants, according to a sanitation spokesman -- stand on either side of the conveyor belt, on scaffolding 15 feet above ground. They wear orange hard hats, heavy gloves, heavy work clothes and face masks. Pinned to the wood beams are dozens of holy pictures, of Jesus and the Virgin Mary.</p>
        <p>''We see them in the trash,'' Mr. Munez said. ''We take them out and put them up.''</p>
        <p>Occasionally, other salvageable or odd items show up, too: functional bicycles, kitchen sinks and stoves, and once, horrifically, a dead baby.</p>
        <p>At one end of the building is a mountain of multicolored trash. Garbage trucks continually replenish it, dumping crushed cans, glittering shards of glass, dented plastic bottles, plastic bags. (Paper is dumped at another spot.) The trash is shoved into chutes by bulldozers, where it passes through the rotating cylinder, beneath the magnet and out onto the conveyor belts that wind between the rows of workers. The air is dusty, but not particularly pungent -- recyclables, after all, are nonorganic.</p>
        <p>Sorting trash requires concentration. The men stare at the trash stream as intently as hunters, and their hands fly. They specialize, and grab only one kind of recyclable. One picks out white plastic bleach and laundry detergent bottles, while another takes the clear or colored plastic: shampoo and water and hand lotion bottles. A third is assigned the flattened milk and fruit juice containers, and a fourth, the aluminum foil plates that held frozen food.</p>
        <p>Somebody else fishes out the plastic bags, which cannot be recycled.</p>
        <p>All day, they grab and flip. The stuff is thrown into holes, where it falls into heaps. When a heap is big enough, a driver on a baling machine crushes it into a dense block, about 5 feet by 4 feet. The bale of flattened plastic bottles or aluminum soda cans is dropped onto a stack. Eventually, it is sold to a manufacturer, to be made into more containers.</p>
        <p>While scrap metal and rags have long been collected, recycling plants are a fairly new business. They began opening in the New York metropolitan region after the city mandated recycling in 1989, after the public relations disaster of the Mobro, the garbage barge carrying Long Island trash that traveled to Florida and back, unable to find a landfill that would accept its load.</p>
        <p>Like the Browning-Ferris center, most of the recycling plants are owned by big waste companies, and the few that are not will probably wind up being absorbed. Mr. Kruk said he came to the Bushwick plant when Browning-Ferris bought the little recycling plant he and a friend had started in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Recycling plants make money by selling the recyclables, at prices that fluctuate widely. Aluminum cans are selling for about $1,000 a ton these days, while steel cans are going for 2 or 3 cents a ton, Mr. Kruk said. Newsprint ranges from a few cents to $100 a ton, he said. Mixed-color glass is virtually worthless.</p>
        <p>While the city pays recycling plants to take some things, like glass and plastic, the plants pay for others, like paper. Of the 13,000 tons of garbage that the city collects from New York City households every day, 2,400 tons are recyclables, including 1,300 tons of paper. A high percentage of it is dumped at the Browning-Ferris plant in Bushwick: 825 tons, including 300 tons of paper.</p>
        <p>The dirty secret of recycling is the waste. A third of the trash dumped at the plant is not salvageable, and is hauled to private landfills. ''Plastic bags and toys,'' said Mr. Kruk, listing some of the nonrecyclable things that turn up. ''Clothing, hoses, plastic gardening pots, irons and diapers and furniture and exercise equipment and broken VCR's.''</p>
        <p>''If people throw away a container of peanut butter full of peanut butter,'' he said, ''well, we're not miracle workers. You can't expect a company that gets 10,000 tons a day to clean it out. If you're going to recycle, do it right, or it will just go to the landfill in a more roundabout way.''</p>
        <p>The nonrecyclable trash is hauled to a landfill owned by Allied Waste at the company's expense, Mr. Kruk said.</p>
        <p>New York City's recycling program is a target for criticism from all sides, from residents who want to throw a half-filled peanut butter jar into the garbage, to environmentalists who call it a half-hearted effort with lax enforcement, to budget-watchers who are upset by the cost.</p>
        <p>Unquestionably, it is expensive to recycle, mostly because of the extra trucks and employees required for separate collections. The cost of recycling is $314 a ton; the cost of collecting and dumping nonrecyclable garbage is $170 a ton.</p>
        <p>Nor is the percentage of trash recycled in the city impressive. Experts say that 60 percent of garbage is potentially recyclable. Many suburban towns, as well as some bigger cities, like Portland, Ore., and Minneapolis, recycle 40 to 50 percent of their garbage. In New York, 20 percent of the garbage is recycled -- and, if the Browning-Ferris plant is typical, as much as a third of that is unusable and dumped in landfills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lawitts, of the sanitation department, said that the percentage of household trash being recycled had increased significantly in the last four years and that through education and enforcement, the city was hoping to reach 25 percent in 2002. Every New York resident, and every business, is required to sort recyclables from other trash. But enforcement is difficult in a city of high-rises, where there is no way to figure out whose trash bags are whose.</p>
        <p>A result is the dirty, motley mess of stuff, with a high percentage of unusable and sometimes undefinable items that the Browning-Ferris workers must sort each day, a job that most describe as tiring, repetitive and boring.</p>
        <p>''It is long,'' Mr. Ba said. ''But I need the money. I have two sons. I want them to go to college and do something else.''</p>
