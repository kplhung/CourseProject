        <p>THINGS are hopping -- literally -- in the West 32nd Street basement of St. Francis of Assisi Church, headquarters for Father Brian Jordan, the scrappy Franciscan determined to play mediator in the stand-off between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the family of Patrick M. Dorismond, the security guard slain by the police in March.</p>
        <p>Father Jordan, a nonconformist (registered Democrat, practicing Independent), skipped the pomp of last week's installation of Archbishop Edward M. Egan because he ''had better things to do'' working his church's bread line. So don't expect anything fancy in the cellar where he works his miracles. Or tries to.</p>
        <p>A stray roach scuttles, a swatted fly kamikazes into a smile-face note pad, and here comes the priest himself, darting downstairs in earthy sandals, paint-dabbed T-shirt, and jogging shorts (he's a marathon man, 36 attempts, 36 finishes) with a nervous Filipino immigrant in tow.</p>
        <p>Sure, Father Jordan, 44, owns a regulation brown monk's habit -- that's it in the corner hanging from a ceiling pipe, rope belt as intact as a noose. But when the daily chores include painting the church and sneaking in a meditative jog, you save the robe for official stuff like saying Mass (St. Francis has 13 a day), hearing confession or jetting to Ecuador to fly a sick child to a brain tumor operation you've finagled at Sloan-Kettering as part of a project that brings sick children to American hospitals. Father Jordan may be hatless, but he wears a ton of hats.</p>
        <p>''Take care, champ,'' he says, sending the Filipino on his way with a wave and the proper paperwork. Father Jordan's sub-specialty is amnesty for immigrants, and he's a bit of a vigilante, even spent two years working for his arch-enemy, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and admits to ''failing miserably'' in his hopes of leaving it a kinder, gentler institution.</p>
        <p>''It's like that line from 'The Godfather': keep your friends close and your enemies closer,'' says Father Jordan, who grew up in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, with a circle of friends he refers to as ''Goodfellas types.'' He jokes that his neighborhood carried a lot of clout when it came to career type-casting: ''In that part of Brooklyn, you become one of the three P's: priest, policeman or perpetrator.''</p>
        <p>Not that he exhibited much in the way of heavenly attributes early on: his first day as an altar boy, he tripped the priest and ran out of the church the minute Mass ended, convinced he'd burn in hell.</p>
        <p>WE grew up ingrained to pray and be afraid of sin and Satan,'' says Father Jordan, who had six siblings, an overburdened mother and a father who was a traveling sales manager. The family tree included no priests, nor was he pressured to become one; his father wanted him to be a lawyer.</p>
        <p>So off he went upstate to Siena College to major in political science and minor in rugby. ''The parties were rougher than the games,'' says Father Jordan, who hasn't lost his taste for beer. But a funny thing happened during a weekend retreat to Lake George with the college's Franciscan faculty: he experienced a moment of grace, and a friar suggested he consider the priesthood.</p>
        <p>The flashback animates him.</p>
        <p>''Me, a priest? What are you, kidding me? I like parties, girls, drinking, getting into fights; I'm getting ready to apply to law school!'' he said at the time. ''I didn't think I was holy enough!'' he says now. Back at school, he expressed his doubts to the Rev. Richard O'Connor, who had been a chaplain at the Nuremberg trials: ''He told me he'd never heard of God sending anyone to hell, that people send themselves there. This man had heard the final words of Himmler and Goring. So I listened to his.''</p>
        <p>If anyone doubts his ability to mediate, consider this: he put it to the test when he told his parents he was headed for the monastery instead of the bar exam. His mother was washing dishes, his father was packing for a trip and, fresh from a squabble, neither was speaking to the other. When he insisted they gather in the living room, ''I think they were afraid I was going to tell them I'd gotten a girl pregnant or knocked over a candy store or something.''</p>
        <p>His news stunned them to silence, then provoked a group embrace: ''My father canceled his trip, and we threw a big party.''</p>
        <p>He has no illusions that the Giuliani-Dorismond affair will resolve itself in a sea of party hats, but he's plugging away. Why the involvement? He was infuriated when the Mayor released the victim's police record. He regressed to his life's other defining flashback, the day after Martin Luther King's assassination, when a bunch of Italian and Irish school chums set upon a tiny group of African-American children under the ''el.''</p>
        <p>''I had this sense of revulsion, of injustice,'' says Father Jordan, who threw punches with the black side until the police arrived. ''I felt the same when the mayor released the record: that was the mayor at his worst, and I felt like I had to do something. No big deal. I've taken on causes, had my head handed to me.''</p>
        <p>Negotiations have stalled since the Rev. Al Sharpton, a man of the cloth cut from different cloth than Father Jordan, stepped into the Dorismond camp. But Father Jordan, who believes the Mayor's remorse is sincere and not staged, isn't giving up.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't stay involved if I thought it was a put-on,'' he says. ''I'm a hard guy to fool.''</p>
