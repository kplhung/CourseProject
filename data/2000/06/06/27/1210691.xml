        <p>The State Department's decision to no longer use the term ''rogue states'' to describe the likes of Libya, North Korea or Iran, but to refer to them instead as ''states of concern,'' was one of those policy moves that is easy to ridicule. In fact, let's do that for a moment.</p>

        <p>The State Department's decision to no longer use the term ''rogue states'' to describe the likes of Libya, North Korea or Iran, but to refer to them instead as ''states of concern,'' was one of those policy moves that is easy to ridicule. In fact, let's do that for a moment.</p>
        <p>I travel to some of these places and I can't imagine calling home and having my wife ask me, as she often does, ''Where are you?'' and I answer, ''Honey, I'm in a state of concern.'' That's really going to cause problems. Couldn't we do something more politically correct, like referring to the North Koreas and Iraqs as states that are ''legally challenged'' or ''states in need of Ritalin''?</p>
        <p>Kidding aside, there is a serious issue behind the State Department's move. On the one hand, it makes sense that we stop calling these countries rogue states, because such blanket categorization can obscure our own thinking and thus our ability to adapt policy and respond to changes.</p>
        <p>But on the other hand, categorizing them as ''states of concern'' doesn't solve all our problems. It implies that there are ''states of concern'' and everybody else is basically on the right track -- and that is not the case.</p>
        <p>You see, there are basically two broad trends in the world today. One, which the State Department has captured, is that due largely to the pressures of globalization, rogue states increasingly do not want to, or can't afford to, remain rogues any longer, and are reaching out.</p>
        <p>But due to the same pressures, many new or old democracies are no longer able to remain democracies either -- and this is just as big a concern. I would call these ailing democracies ''states of flux,'' which could turn into ''states of despair'' or even ''states of rage.''</p>
        <p>Let's look at them all. It is not surprising that the State Department would want to redefine rogue states, because at least some of the rogues are looking to go straight. During the cold war, rogues had more fun. Being a rogue state was a growth industry, because the Soviet Union or China were always there to buy your rogue junk, rebuild your rogue army and subsidize your roguish life style.</p>
        <p>But with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and China going from Mao to Merrill Lynch, there is no more superpower to subsidize a roguish life style. Countries that want to grow today have to turn to the supermarkets -- the big global financial markets -- and they not only won't subsidize roguish behavior, they will punish countries for roguish behavior by withholding money to grow.</p>
        <p>That's why rogue states wanting to remain rogue states today have to be able to either generate their own income -- with oil, drugs or diamonds -- or be able to terrorize and isolate their people so efficiently that they have no choice but to suffer in silence. But as internal changes in Iran, Syria, North Korea and Cuba all demonstrate, even the most isolated, ideological rogues are finding it harder and harder to go it alone.</p>
        <p>So all of these rogue leaders are trying to reach out and open up -- but without giving up power or totally going straight. ''All these states realize that gradually opening up their countries and engaging in the global economy is their only answer, but a soft landing for their societies means a hard landing for their regimes,'' says the Wilson Center's Robert Litwak, author of ''Rogue States and U.S. Foreign Policy.''</p>
        <p>So we are now entering a period in which all these rogue regimes (and China) are going to try to bring their hard states in for soft landings, but without giving up power, and that is going to spark a lot of infighting, backsliding and civil wars.</p>
        <p>But these same pressures on countries to open up, get up to speed for globalization and build institutions that are squeezing the rogues are also threatening to turn some old and new democracies -- Pakistan, Indonesia, Venezuela, Colombia, Nigeria, Peru and maybe Russia -- into new rogues. These are the ''states of flux'' -- countries that opted for democracy, but have been so swamped by corruption and overwhelmed by the difficulties of state-building that their democracies are increasingly imperiled or virtually dead.</p>
        <p>The danger is that these states of flux will turn into states of despair (Sierra Leone or Liberia) -- literally failed states. And, if more and more democracies fill that category, it could turn out to be our biggest concern of all.</p>
