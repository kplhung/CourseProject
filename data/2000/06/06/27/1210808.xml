        <p>A former Brooklyn police officer convicted twice in the Abner Louima case has written a searing yet solemn letter in anticipation of his sentencing this morning, defiantly proclaiming his innocence and angrily attacking his prosecution as a ''modern-day lynching.''</p>
        <p>In the nine-page letter delivered last month to a federal probation officer, the former officer, Charles Schwarz, said that he was never involved in the brutal assault on Mr. Louima and the government knew it.</p>
        <p>''Led by an overzealous prosecutor and motivated by blind ambition, the federal government did everything to ensure that an innocent man would be convicted,'' Mr. Schwarz, wrote in the letter, whose contents were first reported yesterday in Newsday. ''Unwilling to admit that they made a mistake and fearful of repercussions from the minority community if they did so, the prosecutors continued on with their inquisition. Never in my career as a police officer had I ever been witness to such despicable, immoral, unethical and illegal conduct.''</p>
        <p>At the first Louima trial in June 1999, a jury found Mr. Schwarz guilty of helping Officer Justin A. Volpe sodomize Mr. Louima with a broken broom handle inside the 70th Precinct station house on Aug. 9, 1997. Mr. Volpe has said that Mr. Schwarz was not involved. Still, Mr. Schwarz was convicted in March at a second trial of hatching a plot to cover up the attack with two of his fellow officers, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese.</p>
        <p>This morning, the three men are to be sentenced in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. Mr. Schwarz faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. Mr. Schwarz wrote, ''I am sorry that Abner Louima suffered so horribly and I sympathize with the pain of his family. There is no excuse for what happened to Abner Louima; however, I will not take responsibility for a criminal act that I didn't commit, nor will I apologize for something I didn't do. I refuse to degrade and dishonor my family by begging for leniency for a crime that I'm innocent of.''</p>
