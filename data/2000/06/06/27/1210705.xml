        <p>Seeking to end the mystery surrounding the so-called third secret of Fatima, the Vatican released a photocopy of the handwritten manuscript today with a commentary explaining how the Vatican concluded that the prophecy referred to the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II.</p>
        <p>A Vatican news conference, broadcast live on Italian television and on a worldwide satellite feed, was supposed to be the final word on a long undisclosed prophecy that has fascinated Fatima conspiracy theorists for decades and that was not fully put to rest when the Vatican first revealed its interpretation last month.</p>
        <p>Noting that some people may remain ''disappointed or amazed after all the speculation it has stirred,'' Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, said: ''No great mystery is revealed. The future is not unveiled.''</p>
        <p>But he did try to explain one of the more intriguing enigmas woven into the Fatima legend, namely why the Vatican kept the third secret under wraps for so long.</p>
        <p>''It was not a matter of dogma, but of prudence,'' Cardinal Ratzinger said in reply to a question. ''We didn't want to present an undecipherable vision that would unleash speculation and insults.''</p>
        <p>For decades, in books, doomsday cults and most recently, on Web sites, Fatima enthusiasts speculated that the third secret, revealed by an apparition of the Virgin Mary to three Portuguese shepherd children in the village of Fatima in 1917, predicted the end of the world, or an ideological rift in the Roman Catholic church. Three popes saw the secret, according to the Vatican, and decided not to release it. Finally, on May 13 this year at Fatima, the Vatican secretary of state told an audience of 600,000 believers that the secret actually referred to the attempted assassination of John Paul II, a ''bishop clothed in white.''</p>
        <p>Fatima fanatics had held hunger strikes -- one even hijacked a plane -- to try to force the Vatican to disclose the secret. Some devotees were not fully convinced by today's revelations.</p>
        <p>''There is no excuse for not releasing it sooner if this is all there is,'' complained the Rev. Nicholas Gruner, director of the Fatima center in Fort Erie, Ontario, who has lobbied for full disclosure since 1978.  He said he suspected that the manuscript released by the Vatican was an authentic first draft, ''but not the full statement.''</p>
        <p>The Vatican described the photocopy released today as the full text, saying it was written on Jan. 3, 1944 by Sister Lucia, now 93, a Carmelite nun who is the only surviving witness to the apparitions that believers say began on May 13, 1917. In her recollection, the Virgin showed the three children an ''angel with a flaming sword,'' and ''a bishop dressed in white -- 'we had the impression that it was the holy father.' '' The letter goes on to describe how the pope,  ''half trembling with halting step, afflicted with pain and sorrow,''  reaches the foot of a cross and is ''killed by a group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at him.''</p>
        <p>Cardinal Ratzinger's commentary said the images were not to be taken literally, but rather ''synthesize and compress against a single background facts which extend through time.'' The vision reflected the martyrdom of the church in the 20th century, and its warning became clear, he said, in 1981. ''When, after the attempted assassination of 13 May 1981, the holy father had the text of the third of the secret brought to him, was it not inevitable that he should see in it his own fate?''</p>
        <p>The pope has always credited the Virgin of Fatima with saving his life.  Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone, secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, said today that the pope did not see the third secret, kept in the archives of the congregation, until after the 1981 attack, when he asked that it be brought to him in the hospital. He added that Sister Lucia confirmed the Vatican's interpretation in an interview he had with her on April 27 in Portugal.</p>
        <p>Cardinal Ratzinger, who also explained that belief in the visions at Fatima was up to individual Catholics and not an obligatory part of church teaching, also spoke rather gingerly about Fatima's significance.</p>
        <p>''It is not the intention of the church to impose a single interpretation,'' he warned. ''But in light of history, we can decipher the vision.''</p>
        <p>He stressed the underlying message of free will, saying, ''The future is not in fact unchangeably set, and the image which the children saw is in no way a film preview of a future in which nothing can be changed.''</p>
        <p>The Vatican also stressed that the pope's would-be assassin, Mehmet Ali Agca, who was pardoned and extradited to Turkey this month by the Italian government with Vatican approval, had acted of his own free will.</p>
        <p>''We must totally discount fatalistic explanations of the 'secret,' such as for example, the claim that the would-be assassin of 13 May 1981 was merely an instrument of the divine plan,'' Cardinal Ratzinger wrote in his commentary.</p>
        <p>The first ''secret'' of Fatima was a vision of hell; the second predicted World War II and warned that the collapse of Communism would require that Russia be consecrated to the Virgin. Those visions lent the shrine an anti-Communist mystique throughout the cold war.</p>
        <p>Today, in answer to a question, Cardinal Ratzinger suggested that in hindsight, the focus on Russia was perhaps too limited.</p>
        <p>''Communism was classical atheism, but other systems, including Nazism, were also radically atheist,'' he said. ''There is no exclusivity.''</p>
