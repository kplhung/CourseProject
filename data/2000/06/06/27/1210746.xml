        <p>Appropriations committees in the Assembly and Senate today unanimously approved a proposed New Jersey budget of $21.5 billion, an increase of nearly 10 percent from the spending plan signed a year ago.</p>
        <p>The budget, which awaits floor votes in both houses on Thursday, includes another record surplus, $870 million, and $228 million more in spending than Gov. Christine Todd Whitman requested in January.</p>
        <p>Of that, $122 million, roughly twice as much as a year ago, consists of lawmakers' gifts to their districts -- from $3,000 for an electronic speed-monitoring device for Bethlehem Township to $3 million for unspecified redevelopment projects in Mercer County.</p>
        <p>Missing from the budget bill, however, is a $45 million sum requested by Governor Whitman for aid to inner-city school districts. The governor's spokesman, Pete McDonough, said lawmakers were expected to appropriate that money on Thursday in a last-minute rush of supplemental spending measures for the current fiscal year.</p>
        <p>But that $45 million expense will reduce the surplus anticipated for next year's budget to $825 million, well below the $850 million Mrs. Whitman has set as a minimum for New Jersey to maintain its strong bond rating, Mr. McDonough said. That, in turn, means that the governor will use line-item vetoes to cut at least $25 million in spending, he said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman will have until midnight on Friday to announce her line-item vetoes in time for the new fiscal year. All told, the proposed budget authorizes spending $21,480,950,000 in state revenue -- a 9.7 percent increase from last year's budget law -- and $8,000,437,000 from the federal government.</p>
        <p>Of the $228 million in additions to the budget since January, Mr. McDonough said the governor had asked for $85 million in extra school aid, but that lawmakers had come up with the other $143 million.</p>
        <p>At a news conference today, Governor Whitman said she was concerned about the level of ''discretionary'' spending included in the budget but acknowledged that demands from constituents were hard to resist in times of plenty.</p>
        <p>Assemblywoman Barbara Buono, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, called the size of the state budget ''unimaginable'' and raised concerns about the state's debt, which will require $1.5 billion in interest payments next year. But she signed the bill along with the 10 other committee members, praising increases for additional human services caseworkers and for reversing cuts in aid to nursing homes.</p>
