        <p>Forecasts From the Past</p>
        <p>It was mailed quarterly at the cost of $750 a year. With pages thick as wallpaper, each issue arrived in a different format, including one in 1968 with a cover of Styrofoam and tin foil. Visionaire, the avant-garde fashion publication of today, turns out to have had a grandparent -- Presage, a hyper-designed fashion forecasting journal that appeared from 1961 through the mid-80's (right).</p>
        <p>Glenn Horowitz, a dealer of rare books with stores on East 76th Street and in East Hampton, acquired dozens of back issues of Presage not long ago, and they have been whetting the appetite and interest of fashion insiders. ''It's an incredible inspiration for any magazine groupie,'' Matts Gustafon, a fashion illustrator, said. The Calvin Klein company bought a few issues after Michael Berkowitz, design director for the men's underwear division, discovered the collection. ''It's the vocabulary of fashion to understand what's been done in the past,'' he said. ''There's a great mix of fashion photographs and prints. It creates a mood for the season.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Horowitz sells single issues for $125 to $8,000. A nearly complete set, with 100 issues, is priced at $45,000. Rosita Fanto, who edited Presage for its entire run, worked studiously to cull information from social, economic and political developments, she said, to anticipate what fabrics, colors and patterns would reign during a given fashion season. ''I saw every possible art gallery exhibit there was to be seen,'' Ms. Fanto said.</p>
        <p>Body Image Summit</p>
        <p>Magazine editors and representatives of the British Medical Association gathered in London last week for a meeting the British press called ''the superwaif summit,'' where they discussed whether fashion publications should limit pictures that supposedly encourage eating disorders.</p>
        <p>The meeting, officially known as the Body Image Summit, was organized by the government's minister for women, Tessa Jowell, in response to a recent report by the medical association declaring that the news media's obsession with skinnness is largely to blame for an escalating number of eating disorders in Britain.</p>
        <p>Editors from Marie Claire, British Vogue and other magazines agreed to form a committee to monitor images of women in news pages and in advertisements. The group will ostensibly decide how skinny is too skinny, and all will band together to forgo images that might send the wrong message. According to an official transcript of the meeting in the London press, Liz Jones, Marie Claire's editor, said: ''A code of self-regulation would mean if an agency sent us a very thin model whose bones were showing through her skin, we would send her back and write to the agency as well as other magazines telling them not to use her.'' Ms. Jones has spoken publicly about her own struggle with eating disorders.</p>
        <p>Alexandra Shulman, editor of British Vogue, was quoted as endorsing the proposal, but said blame should not fall entirely on the news media.  Glenda Bailey, the founding editor of British Marie Claire and the current editor of the magazine's American edition, acknowledged that ''a code of ethics is very difficult to institute.'' Still, the British meeting prompted Ms. Bailey, who put the full-figured Rosie O'Donnell on a cover of Marie Claire, to write a letter last week to Theresa Loar, director of the President's Interagency Council on Women in Washington, suggesting a conference for the United States.</p>
        <p>Cartoon Vision of Fashion</p>
        <p>In the first episode of ''Spy Groove,'' an animated series that made its debut on MTV last night, the heroes saved South Miami Beach from destruction. In Episode 2, viewers will be treated to cartoon renderings of the Vogue editors Anna Wintour and Andre Leon Tally at a runway show, looking considerably more aghast than they do at real-life versions of those events. The episode, which will be seen next Monday, revolves around the efforts of the series stars, Agents 1 and 2, to stop Contessa, an aspiring designer who resembles Ivana Trump, from destroying the world's other fashion empires.</p>
        <p>''Spy Groove'' exists to make fun of the current Centro-Fly, Wall Paper magazine, martini-swilling aesthetic. The creators say they don't think the style references are too rarefied for an MTV audience made up of 16-year-olds.</p>
        <p>''Fashion is everywhere,'' said Richard Register, who with Michael Gans, both stand-up comedians, created the show. ''If you're living in rural Tennessee, there are girls flipping through Elle and thinking, 'Oh my God, Claudia Schiffer! I have to set my hair like that.' ''</p>
