        <p>With time running out on a court order keeping Elian Gonzalez in the United States, the Miami relatives of 6-year-old Elian asked the Supreme Court today to block his return to Cuba pending a formal appeal.</p>
        <p>If the court denies the request or declines to take up the issue, Elian will be free to return to Cuba after 4 p.m. on Wednesday, when a stay ordered by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, expires.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez of Miami, the boy's great-uncle, asked the Supreme Court for an emergency stay to give the justices at least two weeks to consider the appeal ''on a very, very fast timetable.''</p>
        <p>Kendall Coffey, a lawyer working for Lazaro Gonzalez, challenged the Atlanta court's ruling last week, in which it refused to reconsider a plea to hold a political asylum hearing for the boy. The Justice Department and Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, oppose such a hearing.</p>
        <p>''The overwhelming weight of federal appellate decisions in this country would have given Elian Gonzalez the absolute constitutional right to an asylum hearing five months ago,'' Mr. Coffey said in Miami.</p>
        <p>In court filings, the lawyers for the Miami relatives argued that a few additional weeks' delay in deciding Elian's fate would be ''a minimal cost in a case with stakes of such magnitude.'' Any burden to Elian's father ''does not outweigh the truly irreparable harms'' that would be visited upon the boy if a stay were not issued, they said.</p>
        <p>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy received the appeal, which contends that Elian was denied due process by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The boy was plucked from the waters off South Florida on Thanksgiving Day after his mother and 10 other Cubans drowned crossing the Florida Straits.</p>
        <p>Lazaro Gonzalez took the boy to his home in Miami and, later, refused to return him to his father. On April 22, federal agents seized Elian and reunited him with his father, who had arrived from Cuba several days earlier. They have been living in the Washington area ever since with Juan Miguel Gonzalez's current wife, the couple's infant son and several of Elian's Cuban classmates and their parents.</p>
        <p>Given the impending deadline, Justice Kennedy is expected to act quickly on the request, possibly as early as Tuesday. He may handle the case himself or refer it to the full court.</p>
        <p>An emergency stay like the kind sought by the Miami relatives is rarely granted unless there is an outstanding legal problem, legal experts said. A senior Clinton administration official who is following the case closely predicted that Elian would return to Cuba by the end of the week.</p>
        <p>But Juan Miguel Gonzalez is not taking anything for granted, his lawyer said today, and officials said he had not yet requested the help of federal marshals or other authorities to prepare for a move.</p>
        <p>''My sense is they're all eager to see their friends and family,'' said Gregory B. Craig, the lawyer for Juan Miguel Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>If the court order expires on Wednesday, Mr. Craig added, ''I don't think there's going to be a sprint to the airport, but I think, in a very orderly fashion, they will arrange for their departure.''</p>
        <p>Cuban officials declined to say what sort of a reception might await Elian in Cuba, where the government of President Fidel Castro has raised him to the status of a folk hero. One official, requesting anonymity, merely said that any homecoming would be handled discreetly, without adding to ''the circuslike atmosphere'' around the boy.</p>
