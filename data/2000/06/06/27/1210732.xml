        <p>The Irish Republican Army announced today that two international envoys had inspected a number of its secret arms dumps, a significant step in advancing the Northern Ireland peace settlement.</p>
        <p>The envoys, Martti Ahtisaari, the former president of Finland, and Cyril Ramaphosa, the former secretary general of the African National Congress, confirmed the news in visits to Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of Ireland.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair welcomed the announcement. He emphasized that the arms inspections were a valuable ''confidence building measure'' but did not satisfy the longer range goal of complete disarmament. ''It is not decommissioning itself,'' he said. ''It is a step on the way.''</p>
        <p>The inspections fulfilled a promise  made by the I.R.A. in May in response to demands that it move toward dismantling its arsenal in exchange for Britain's restoring the authority of the new Catholic-Protestant power-sharing Northern Ireland government. It had been suspended in February over earlier I.R.A. inaction on arms.</p>
        <p>The two envoys, who had been  appointed as weapons monitors, reported that they had seen ''a substantial amount of military material.'' They said they had satisfied themselves that it was ''safely and adequately stored'' and had made sure that ''the weapons and explosives cannot be used without our detection.''</p>
        <p>They said they intended to visit the  stockpiles regularly to ensure that the weapons ''have remained secure'' and noted that the I.R.A. had met all their requests. ''The process that led to the first inspection visit and the way in which it was carried out makes us believe that this is a genuine effort by the I.R.A. to advance the peace process,'' they said.</p>
        <p>The I.R.A. also confirmed today that it had ended its four-month boycott of the international disarmament commission led by a Canadian, Gen. John de Chastelain, and was  cooperating with the panel again. The commission is charged with determining whether the disarmament envisioned in the agreement is satisfactorily carried out and is the body to which Mr. Ramaphosa and Mr. Ahtisaari will report their findings. It is formally independent of the British and Irish governments, which sponsored the talks that led to the April 1998 peace accord.</p>
        <p>The I.R.A. is thought to have an arsenal of automatic rifles, pistols, machine guns, grenades, rocket launchers and ammunition stashed in remote underground spots in woods and fields across Ireland and in border areas of Northern Ireland. It was not known whether the two inspectors were made aware of the exact locations of the dumps they examined or what portion of the overall arms cache held by the guerrilla group they had inspected.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ahtisaari, who helped persuade President Slobodan Milosevic to accept the peace plan for Kosovo, and Mr. Ramaphosa gave no details of how they had satisfied themselves that the weaponry they saw would remain out of use, but Mr. Ahern said the bunkers they had visited would be entombed and re-examined periodically to make sure the seals had not been broken.</p>
        <p>Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, said the inspectors had given him ''a lot of confidence'' that the I.R.A. did not intend to remove or use weapons in the inspected dumps. ''There is a device in place that would indicate whether or not that is the case,'' Mr. Mandelson said. He said it was important not to disclose more details because there were dissident republican groups who had not declared cease-fires.</p>
        <p>The two monitors said they had consulted arms-control specialists with experience in inspecting and verifying weapons to come up with ''credible'' means of doing the job themselves.</p>
        <p>Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the I.R.A., praised it for being ''very, very courageous'' and called today's action a ''huge step forward.''</p>
        <p>Seamus Mallon of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party and the deputy leader of the new home-rule Northern Ireland Assembly said, ''It marks another step in realizing the full potential of the agreement.''</p>
        <p>David Trimble, leader of the largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, and first minister of the legislature, was in the Middle East and due back in the province on Tuesday. Sir Reg Empey, an Ulster Unionist minister in the government and a close ally of Mr. Trimble, said the announcement constituted a ''breakthrough'' but cautioned, ''There is still a lot further to go.''</p>
        <p>Opponents of the peace settlement were predictably harsher. ''I have made it clear that the inspection of a few arms dumps does not represent progress in itself,'' said Jeffrey Donaldson, an Ulster Unionist challenger to Mr. Trimble's party leadership. The Rev. Ian Paisley's hard-line Democratic Unionists dismissed the development as a ''complete and total gimmick, not a complete and total cease-fire.''</p>
        <p>Both the I.R.A. and Protestant paramilitary groups have observed  cease-fires for more than three years. For much of that time, the  I.R.A. has argued that its success in silencing its guns should be proof of its commitment to a peaceful resolution of Northern Ireland's troubles. But more recently it has had to take steps like the one announced today to meet insistent political demands for taking guns out of the politics of Ulster.</p>
        <p>There is a strong feeling within the republican movement that disarmament constitutes surrender, and it has made the I.R.A. extremely reluctant to turn over arms. Mr. Adams today called the move to permit inspections by independent outsiders an ''imaginative'' way to meet the I.R.A.'s pledge last month to put its weapons ''completely and verifiably beyond use.''</p>
