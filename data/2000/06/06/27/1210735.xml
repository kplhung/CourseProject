        <p>An outfield of Sammy Sosa, Bernie Williams and Juan Gonzalez just might have been the greatest outfield ever assembled. It is not a fantasy outfield. It is not a Rotisserie outfield. It could have been the Yankees' outfield.</p>
        <p>And the Yankees would not have had to trade all of their minor league prospects to get Sosa and Gonzalez. They had both youngsters within their grasp before they signed their first professional contracts with other teams. Sosa, Williams, Gonzalez. They would have been this era's Tinker to Evers to Chance, memorialized in poetry and song.</p>
        <p>And just how would the Yankees have accomplished this master stroke? By signing Sosa when he was in their tryout camp in the Dominican Republic in 1984 and taking Gonzalez more seriously, in 1985, when their scouts saw him and when Williams talked about his friend, who happened to be Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>Some of the Gonzalez story, though not all, has been told before. Sosa related his Yankees experience in his autobiography, which was published earlier this year. But Fred Ferreira, a remarkably candid executive with the Montreal Expos, added perspective to both stories this week in the face of the Yankees' efforts to acquire Gonzalez or Sosa in a trade.</p>
        <p>Ferreira was the Yankees' international scouting director when Gonzalez and Sosa were approaching the age when they could sign with major league organizations. Sosa came first, arriving at the Yankees' complex in San Cristobal just after he turned 16 years old.</p>
        <p>''I threw myself into every drill,'' he recounted in ''Sosa,'' written with Marcos Breton and published by Warner Books, ''and I stayed for a while, hoping that the elusive offer would finally come, that I would finally get a real contract.''</p>
        <p>Sosa added that ''everything was going well with the Yankees'' until a trip to the bathroom changed the course of baseball history.</p>
        <p>About two weeks into the camp, or school, Sosa and his fellow hopefuls were ''just hanging out after a practice'' when Sosa needed to use the bathroom. He was wearing only his underwear, and that was apparently against camp rules. When he went to practice the next day, Sosa related, he was told that ''I'm thrown off the team.'' He protested, but to no avail. He went home, his goal unfulfilled.</p>
        <p>''I sent him home,'' Ferreira said in a telephone interview Sunday night. ''My man in the Dominican called me and said: 'You know the kid you saw the other day and liked a little bit? He just did this tonight.' I said: 'Oh really? Tell him to pack his bag and get out.' ''</p>
        <p>Ferreira said he had never told the story before but that ''it's absolutely true,'' and he stood front and center in acknowledging that it was his decision to jettison the young prospect who would grow up and hit 129 home runs in the past two seasons.</p>
        <p>''I liked him; I sure did,'' Ferreira said. ''But even today, if a kid messes around, you have to have some sort of rules.''</p>
        <p>Ferreira recalled that during the players strike in 1994 he went to the Dominican Republic, and while there encountered Sosa. ''Sammy was all decked out,'' Ferreira related. ''He looked at me and said, 'I remember you.' ''</p>
        <p>It was the summer of 1985 when the Yankees had their shot -- no, two shots -- at Gonzalez in Puerto Rico.</p>
        <p>Roberto Rivera, a Yankees scout on the island, found Williams and also noticed a friend of his. But Rivera went away without pursuing Gonzalez, who was a year younger than the 16-year-old Williams. And the reason Rivera wasn't interested in Gonzalez was that he would dance in the outfield during a game. Rivera felt Gonzalez was horsing around and didn't have the right approach to the game. He said he wanted to sign a player, not a dancer.</p>
        <p>Ferreira said he was unaware of that story, but he readily related another as an addendum to the Williams signing story, which has been told before.</p>
        <p>Having discovered Williams, the Yankees could not sign him, under the rules, until his 17th birthday, which was a couple of months away. Rivera recommended hiding the young Williams, and that's what they did, putting him in a baseball camp in Connecticut near the home of Doug Melvin, then the team's scouting director.</p>
        <p>''We convinced his mother if he was going to play professionally, it would be best for him to become acclimated to the U.S.,'' said Melvin, now the Texas Rangers' general manager. ''He flew home the night before he turned 17.''</p>
        <p>Ferreira arranged Williams's trip to Connecticut. ''Just before Bernie went to the camp,'' Ferreira disclosed, again accepting the consequences of his decisions with class, ''he asked me if there was a chance of him bringing a friend with him. I didn't want to ask Mr. Steinbrenner for more money to hide another kid, so I said no. That kid turned out to be Juan Gonzalez.''</p>
        <p>The Texas Rangers wound up signing Sosa and Gonzalez 10 months apart. Now they are both available as established high-priced talent. The Yankees may wind up with one. They could have had both.</p>
