        <p>The Supreme Court invalidated California's blanket primary today, calling it a ''stark repudiation of freedom of political association'' that stripped political parties of the ability to control their own nominating process and define their identity.</p>
        <p>Under the California system, an extreme version of the more common open primary, all voters, regardless of their party membership, get a single ballot from which they can select among candidates of any party affiliation: a Republican for governor, for example, and a Libertarian for the State Assembly. Alaska and Washington are the only other states with such a system.</p>
        <p>The 7-to-2 decision cast serious doubt on the more common open primary, in use in more than half the states, in which any registered voter can request a particular party's primary ballot. In some states, the crossover privilege is limited to independent voters and does not extend to members of a different party.</p>
        <p>Justice Antonin Scalia, writing the majority opinion today, said that ''this case does not require us to determine the constitutionality of open primaries.'' But Justice John Paul Stevens, who voted in dissent along with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said the decision ''cast serious constitutional doubt'' on those approaches as well.</p>
        <p>The case was an appeal by four California political parties, the Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, and Peace and Freedom Parties. They opposed the blanket primary when it was adopted as a voter initiative in 1996 and then challenged it in court on the ground that it violated their First Amendment right to freedom of association.</p>
        <p>The underlying question for the court was how to characterize a political primary: as the public's business or as the party's essentially private affair. The private view prevailed. ''In no area is the political association's right to exclude more important than in the process of selecting its nominee,'' Justice Scalia said.</p>
        <p>The decision overturned a ruling last year by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which had affirmed an earlier ruling by the Federal District Court in Sacramento that the burden on the parties' right of association was not severe.</p>
        <p>Although the state's political parties objected to Proposition 198, it was popular with the voters; a majority of Democrats and Republicans as well as independents supported it at the polls in 1996. Its supporters' rationale was that it would bring more people to the polls and ''promote representative democracy,'' as California told the justices, by guaranteeing that ''candidates will be more representative of the electorate and more broadly reflect the views of the voters.''</p>
        <p>The majority today found that justification highly objectionable. It was not the business of the state to try to make political parties more ''centrist,'' Justice Scalia said. Rather, he said, the system was an invitation to a party's ideological opponents to raid the primary and select a nominee who does not in fact represent the party's core beliefs. ''A single election in which the party nominee is selected by nonparty members could be enough to destroy the party,'' Justice Scalia said, describing the threat as ''a clear and present danger.''</p>
        <p>The dissenters viewed the entire issue through the opposite end of the analytical telescope, emphasizing the public rather than private function of a political primary.</p>
        <p>''The protections that the First Amendment affords to the internal processes of a political party do not encompass a right to exclude nonmembers from voting in a state-required, state-financed primary election,'' Justice Stevens said in a dissenting opinion that Justice Ginsburg joined.</p>
        <p>He said that while a party's internal governance was its own business, ''an election, unlike a convention or caucus, is a public affair.'' The dissent added that ''in an era of dramatically declining voter participation, states should be free to experiment with reforms designed to make the democratic process more robust by involving the entire electorate in the process of selecting those who will serve as government officials.''</p>
        <p>In his majority opinion, Justice Scalia said the state's interest in opening up the process could be served better, and constitutionally, by a nonpartisan blanket primary. Under that system, parties nominate their candidates and then the voters select from among all the contenders, with the top two vote-getters moving on to the general election. Louisiana has such a system.</p>
        <p>The majority opinion, California Democratic Party v. Jones, No. 99-401, was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer. Justice Kennedy filed a concurring opinion to say that not only Proposition 198 but also federal campaign law, as interpreted and upheld by the court, were undermining political parties' First Amendment rights by limiting the parties' ability to make contributions directly to their candidates and inducing the parties to turn to soft money and issue advocacy.</p>
        <p>''Our unfortunate decisions remit the political party to use of indirect or covert speech to support its preferred candidates, hardly a result consistent with free thought and expression,'' Justice Kennedy said.</p>
