        <p>Christie Pearce has discovered that she can go forward by taking a few steps back.</p>
        <p>As the United States women's national team continues its busy buildup to the Summer Olympics in September in Sydney, Australia, Pearce is emerging as a stalwart at wing back. But she is a defender with the sensibility of a ruthless striker, which is understandable because Pearce once was a ruthless striker.</p>
        <p>''At first, it was hard to adjust,'' she said of playing on the back line. ''I had been playing forward my entire life. I've spent the past three years learning the defensive position and in a way it allows me to play more freely and more confidently.''</p>
        <p>But I'm never going to get that forward out of my blood. It's always there. Now my highlight is taking the ball away and giving it to a forward. Now everything is in front of me where before I usually had my back to the goal. It's a whole different look.</p>
        <p>Pearce, 25, a native of Point Pleasant, N.J., scored 79 career goals as a two-sport (soccer and basketball) standout at Monmouth University in New Jersey and is the first player from a relatively small school to make an impact at the national-team level.</p>
        <p>In this past Friday's gloriously garish 11-0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago in the opener of the Women's Gold Cup, Pearce used her speed and offensive skill to blow past her marker and make two assists when the match was briefly competitive. In Coach April Heinrichs's current scheme, Pearce is expected to step into the attack on the overlap.</p>
        <p>''This formation has a lot of space on the side,'' Pearce said. ''With our players in the middle it allows for a lot of width, which I help create. I'm out there to open up the field.''</p>
        <p>Pearce is out there because of Carla Overbeck's knee injury and struggle to deal with Graves' disease. Overbeck's absence opened a spot on the back line, which Heinrichs filled by moving Joy Fawcett into central defense and elevating Pearce to starter.</p>
        <p>The United States, coming off Sunday's 8-0 victory over Costa Rica, closes out the first round of the Gold Cup tonight against Brazil in Foxboro, Mass. Both teams have qualified for Saturday's semifinals. After the Gold Cup and a match against Italy on Long Island on July 7, the United States, the defending World Cup champions, embarks on a five-game tour in Germany and Norway. There will be three more matches before the team leaves for the Olympics.</p>
        <p>''Yes, when you look at the schedule we are playing a lot of games,'' Pearce said. ''But it's what we need to win the gold medal. We're getting used to jumping off the plane and training. This team adjusts really well. The games are only going to make us a better team.''</p>
        <p>MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER</p>
        <p>The MetroStars expect to have Lothar Matthaus available for tomorrow night's match against San Jose at Giants Stadium. Matthaus is back after Germany's first-round exit from the European Championships.</p>
        <p>He last played for the MetroStars in a 2-0 loss to the Wizards in Kansas City.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars have a 5-1-1 league record (plus a victory in the United States Open Cup) in Matthaus's absence and are 1 point behind New England in Major League Soccer's Eastern Division.</p>
        <p>The Earthquakes come to the East with a 4-7-6 record, but are</p>
        <p>0-7-2 on the road. San Jose earned a 1-1 draw with Chicago on Saturday night on a goal in injury time by the rookie Ian Russell. The Earthquakes played the game without five starters: the Iranian international Khodadad Azizi, Ronald Cerritos, John Doyle, Ryan Tinsley and Wade Barrett. Azizi, who has played in only 10 games this season, is nursing a hamstring injury but is expected to play.</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay's Mamadou Diallo notched his sixth two-goal game of the season in the Mutiny's 3-2 victory over Miami. Diallo now leads the league with 15 goals and 30 points. Carlos Valderrama had three assists, two of them on Diallo goals, and leads the league with 17.</p>
        <p>Tony Meola set the league record for shutouts in a season (12) when the Wizards beat Los Angeles, 2-0. Meola, a native of Kearny, N.J., is also the league's career shutout leader with 33. It was Kansas City's eighth straight shutout at home, a streak of 730 minutes.</p>
        <p>Cobi Jones, a striker for the Los Angeles Galaxy and the United States national team, has told league officials that he is seeking a five-year, $5 million contract, which would make him the highest-paid American in the league. He currently earns the M.L.S. maximum of $270,000.</p>
        <p>Jones, who is the career leader in national team appearances with 129, has not scored a goal in 13 league games. He recently scored twice against South Africa in the Nike U.S. Cup. Jones's representatives assert that there is interest in Europe, where Jones played in 1994-95 (Coventry City in England). He also played half a season in Brazil with Vasco da Gama in 1995-96.</p>
        <p>EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS</p>
        <p>Italy, which plays the Netherlands in the semifinals on Thursday, will be without Antonio Conte, a midfielder for Juventus, who has an injured right ankle. The status of the team captain Paolo Maldini is also in doubt. Maldini has a tender left thigh.</p>
        <p>Patrick Kluivert scored the tournament's second hat trick on Sunday in the Netherlands' quarterfinal romp over Yugoslavia. The only issue is whether he scored three or four goals. Kluivert maintains, and video replays support, that his third goal was actually directed into the Yugoslav net by defender Dejan Govedarica. Game officials ruled otherwise.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>South Korean officials said last week that North Korea would play host to two matches of the 2002 World Cup, which is being shared with Japan.</p>
        <p>The government is mapping out ways for Pyongyang to host 2 of the 32 games that the South is scheduled to host, Park Jie Won, South Korea's culture and tourism minister, told South Korea's National Assembly.</p>
        <p>The announcement came as a direct result of the landmark Korean summit.</p>
