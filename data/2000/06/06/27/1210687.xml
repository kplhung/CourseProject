        <p>Gen. Humberto Gordon, who commanded the Chilean secret police for seven years in Gen. Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, died on June 15 in his house near Santiago. He was 72.</p>
        <p>General Gordon had a heart attack while under house arrest, The Associated Press said.</p>
        <p>After having led the secret police, General Gordon was a member of the junta that controlled Chile from 1973 to 1990. General Pinochet made General Gordon head of the secret police in 1980, after leftist guerrillas had stepped up their activity. Then, as Pamela Constable and Arturo Valenzuela wrote in ''A Nation of Enemies: Chile Under Pinochet'' (1991, Norton), General Gordon ''launched an all-out campaign to infiltrate an destroy the radical left.''</p>
        <p>An official report has said that more than 3,000 people were killed in the Pinochet era and that 1,000 have not been accounted for.</p>
        <p>When General Gordon died, he had retired from the army and had been indicted in connection with the homicide of Tucapel Jimenez, a well-known union leader. A judge had linked the slaying to the secret police. But General Gordon contended that he and his force had no connection with the case. He had also been indicted in connection with four other killings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jimenez was found slain in his car in 1982. He had been repeatedly shot in the face, and his throat had been slashed. For years, the case was tied up in courts by a judge with close ties to the military, which contended that a carpenter had fatally stabbed Mr. Jimenez.</p>
        <p>But a Chilean munitions clerk told a court in Paris that he had issued the murder weapons in Mr. Jimenez's slaying to four agents from the secret police. The agents were set free, for lack of incriminating evidence, after after a trial that brought out information about a secret police plot to demolish opposition labor elements.</p>
        <p>General Gordon married Maruja Maturana, who survives him. They had a daughter.</p>
