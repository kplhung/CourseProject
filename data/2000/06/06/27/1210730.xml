        <p>Type ''tax haven'' into an Internet search engine and the following come-on is less than a second away:</p>
        <p>''Gibraltar -- professional services for using Gibraltar as a financial center and tax haven.''</p>
        <p>Companies and rich people have used offshore financial centers to avoid paying income, corporate and capital gains taxes in industrial countries for generations. The Internet now makes it a snap to do so without leaving the office.</p>
        <p>But wealthy nations, which have lost tens of billions of dollars year after year, declared today that they had had enough.</p>
        <p>The 29-member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development publicly declared a list of 35 mostly exotic island getaways that have tax laws intended to attract assets from companies and people who want to evade actual tax payments or potential tax liabilities in their home countries. The organization identified 47 other places that have ''potentially harmful'' tax laws.</p>
        <p>The 35 havens have generally declined to cooperate with investigators who seek to catch tax dodgers. They were given a year to overhaul their tax laws or face sanctions.</p>
        <p>Globalization of business and the point-and-click ease of moving large amounts of money around the world have transformed remote havens into profitable financial centers.</p>
        <p>The United States strongly backed the ''name and shame'' campaign. It loses billions of dollars in revenue each year because offshore financial centers help people hide income from the Internal Revenue Service, administration officials said.</p>
        <p>Last week, wealthy nations publicized another list, of 15 countries and territories they accuse of declining to crack down on money laundering. Several lands, including the Bahamas, the Cook Islands and Liechtenstein, appear on both lists.</p>
        <p>Wealthy nations have complained for years that small island states profit at their expense by allowing businessmen, millionaires and sometimes criminals to shelter riches. But it took years to build up the diplomatic momentum to publish a blacklist.</p>
        <p>The full tax haven list comprises Andorra, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, the British Virgin Islands, the Cook Islands, Dominica, Gibraltar, Grenada, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Liberia, Liechtenstein, the Maldives, the Marshall Islands, Monaco, Montserrat, Nauru, the Netherlands Antilles, Niue, Panama, Samoa, the Seychelles, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Tonga, Turks and Caicos, the United States Virgin Islands and Vanuatu.</p>
        <p>Many of the cited territories objected to the organization's campaign. One of them, Jersey, issued a statement calling the report absurd and said the wealthy nations had applied a stricter standard for the Pacific and Caribbean countries and territories than they had for Switzerland and Luxembourg, which also have reputations as tax havens. American officials have said those two countries, which are members of the O.E.C.D., generally cooperated with investigations into tax dodging and money laundering.</p>
