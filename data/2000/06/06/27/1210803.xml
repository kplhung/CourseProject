        <p>Supporters of the opposition party cheered and danced on Monday as election results from the weekend's parliamentary elections showed their fledgling party making unprecedented gains on the governing party that has dominated Zimbabwe for 20 years.</p>
        <p>The final result was unclear, but with more than three quarters of the vote in today from counting stations across the country, tallies quickly established that the nine-month-old party had become a powerful opposition force in Zimbabwe -- a feat considered unimaginable just a year ago.</p>
        <p>For years, President Robert Mugabe's governing party has controlled all but three seats in Parliament. But the new opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, easily surpassed that figure, winning 48 seats and claiming lopsided victories in urban districts, where voters have been squeezed by skyrocketing inflation and deepening unemployment.</p>
        <p>Based on the early returns, it appeared that the governing party would likely maintain its majority as it carried 51 mostly rural districts, where the party's support has traditionally been strongest. Mr. Mugabe was also guaranteed 20 appointed seats, giving him at least 71 seats in the 150-member Parliament. The local chiefs elect 10 members.</p>
        <p>Still, the results reflected nothing short of seismic realignment in the political landscape here, laying bare the weaknesses of the governing party and of its chief, Mr. Mugabe, 76, an aging leader who has been widely viewed as unassailable for nearly two decades.</p>
        <p>And the vote also demonstrated the unexpected power of an energized, urban electorate that shook off the political apathy of recent years and carried its frustrations directly to the ballot box.</p>
        <p>''We would have wanted the landslide in the urban areas to have extended to the rural areas, but no matter what the climate will never be the same here again,'' Ian Makone, an official in the M.D.C.'s election directorate, said in an interview early this morning. ''It's never going to be the one party system that it was. That's a thing of the past.''</p>
        <p>Political analysts predicted that the votes would continue to split along urban and rural lines for the 120 parliamentary seats that were up for election as the counting continued through the early morning.</p>
        <p>Government officials had contended all along that they would maintain their majority, but they publicly acknowledged that for the first time they had misjudged the mood and needs of people in the cities.</p>
        <p>''We're not being swept away by these elections, but we're getting a kind of wake-up call,'' said Jonathan Moyo, the spokesman for the governing party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, known as ZANU-P.F. ''They're doing better than I expected them to. It's a reality check for us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mugabe and party officials had campaigned heavily on the pledge that they would make good on their promise to redistribute fertile land, which is still mostly owned by a tiny white minority here. They supported the invasions of hundreds of white-owned farms by black squatters and were widely blamed for condoning a campaign of intimidation and violence that left at least 26 people dead, most of them opposition supporters.</p>
        <p>But the message clearly had little appeal for urban voters, who had grown weary of fuel shortages, corruption and unfulfilled promises. And here in the capital and in the second-largest city, Bulawayo, people flocked in droves to the new party that promised an improved economy and clean government.</p>
        <p>There were casualties on both sides. The losers included Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the M.D.C.; Dumiso Dabengwa, Mr. Mugabe's minister of home affairs; and Emmerson Mnangagwa, the justice minister. All three lost their seats in Parliament.</p>
        <p>The first results, which had been expected on Monday afternoon, trickled in slowly in the evening. In a nation where elections have been characterized by voter apathy in recent years, about 60 percent of the more than 5.8 million registered voters cast ballots during the polls on Saturday and Sunday, and election officials were quickly overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>''The turnout was just too large, overwhelming,'' Tobaiwa Mudede, the Registrar General, said this afternoon. ''They have not started counting.''</p>
        <p>As the nation waited anxiously, the officials spent hours checking ballot boxes and ballot slips for any evidence of tampering or election rigging. Angry young supporters of the opposition grumbled suspiciously.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, observers from the European Union had condemned Mr. Mugabe's party, accusing it of supporting the violence and intimidation that marred the run-up to the vote last weekend. And on Monday, the government quickly deployed police officers around the country to prevent any outbreaks of violence and urged the public to remain calm.</p>
        <p>The observers made it clear that the two days of peaceful voting had done little to allay the concerns spawned by months of unrest.</p>
        <p>''Calls for peaceful campaigning and efforts to restrain party supporters, including war veterans, were often ambiguous,'' said Pierre Schori, the head of the European Union observer mission. ''Overall, the conduct of the government has failed to uphold the rule of law and compromised law enforcement agencies.''</p>
        <p>In the end, the night reportedly passed peacefully, with most people glued to televisions and radios, waiting nervously for results to come in. It was the first time since blacks won majority rule in 1980 that an opposition party had challenged the governing party in every district.</p>
        <p>And it was the first time in nearly two decades that many voters had gone to sleep without knowing for sure what the morning's election result would bring.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a long night, a long wait,'' Mr. Makone said yesterday. ''We're going to be very strong in the urban areas. But it's going to be a nail-biting experience.''</p>
