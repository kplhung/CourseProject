        <p>'Michigan Impossible'  Houseman Studio Theater</p>
        <p>Robert Christophe, a Philadelphian transplanted from Michigan who is part black, part Irish and part Choctaw, has written this one-man show for himself about Jesse Boles, a multiethnic man from Philadelphia who returns to his home in Michigan for the funeral of his grandmother. The show is a memory play; the trip home engenders Jesse's recollections of his boyhood. Central among them is a sequence of events involving his initiation into a gang of tough kids; he is caught robbing doughnuts from a bread truck and rats on his new friends, and, as eventual punishment, they are all sent to Boy Scout camp. Lessons about individuality, ethnic pride and taking one's place in society abound.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christophe, who plays nine different roles, has some gifts as an actor and mime, but his skills as a writer are stretched pretty thin. The adolescent antics, immature defiance and protestations of manliness don't carry this show nearly as far as they are meant to.</p>
        <p>The character of the grandmother, on the other hand, is rather compelling; the tone of her sagacity -- she's a quintessential philosopher and wit -- has a familiar feel to it, but it's a pleasant familiarity. Besides, she has some interesting eccentricities, like enjoying fishing without bait, and Mr. Christophe manages to render her presence, in voice and personality, with only slight alterations in posture and inflection and a well-chosen pair of glasses.</p>
        <p>Why he abandons her halfway through the show and gives the performance over to a bunch of dopey kids and, even worse, a desperately uncool counselor turned scoutmaster, is a puzzling choice. But then, so is the cutesy title.</p>
