        <p>Mattie Harrell pointed yesterday to the second story of her gray stucco house, to a handful of pockmarks gouged out by bullets in 1994 -- indelible evidence that when she and her family moved that year to the outskirts of Vineland, N.J., they were not welcome.</p>
        <p>After five incidents of gunfire in  five months, Ms. Harrell and her family -- the first African-Americans in the neighborhood -- felt some sense of justice later that year, when the police arrested Charles C. Apprendi Jr., a pharmacist who lived about a mile away on the same street.</p>
        <p>A judge, invoking New Jersey's hate crime law, determined that Mr. Apprendi had been motivated by racial bias and sentenced him to 12 years in prison.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the United States Supreme Court, in hearing an appeal of Mr. Apprendi's case, struck down a part of that law, saying that only a jury can decide whether a crime is motivated by bias.</p>
        <p>Ms. Harrell, who continues to live with her three children in the house on Chestnut Street, said the gunfire had caused her family tremendous pain -- pain that was renewed by the high court's decision.</p>
        <p>''It tore the whole family up,'' she said. ''We will never be the same. Today is a slap in the face as far as  being a minority goes.''</p>
        <p>The first bullet entered the wall near her son Michael's bed. At age 14, she said, he still has trouble sleeping. She and her husband divorced a few years after the shootings, she said, in part because of the stress the gunfire caused.</p>
        <p>The police said Mr. Apprendi had told them that he had fired the shots to give Ms. Harrell and her family ''a message'' that they were not wanted. But he later said he suffered from an obsessive-compulsive disorder that prompted him to shoot at the house.</p>
        <p>He pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm with an unlawful purpose and unlawful possession of a bomb, which would have brought him a sentence of 5 to 10 years. But prosecutors asked a judge for a stiffer penalty under the hate crime law.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, in a 5-to-4 vote, the Supreme Court said it was unconstitutional for the judge to have ruled that the offense was a hate crime.</p>
        <p>New Jersey officials, however, said that with legislative fine-tuning, the 10-year-old law could be modified to pass constitutional muster.</p>
        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and legislative leaders said they would change the law to reflect the decision, which struck down only part of the state's Ethnic Intimidation Act.</p>
        <p>''What we need to do is amend the law, and put that power before the jury,'' the governor said. ''They didn't say you can't have hate crime legislation. They didn't say you can't have penalties to it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Apprendi's lawyer, Joseph D. O'Neill, said: ''The bias crime law carries a social stigma, a stigma that you're a racist. I think that deserves a decision by someone's peers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Apprendi has served five and a half years of his sentence and is now in a halfway house, his lawyer said. He was not available for comment. Mr. O'Neill said his client would have to go before a jury for a new sentence.</p>
        <p>Lisa S. Gochman, a deputy state attorney general who represented the state before the Supreme Court, said she believed that there were two other New Jersey cases in which defendants had received longer sentences because a judge had found them guilty of bias crimes. They will also have to return to the trial court for new sentences.</p>
        <p>Ms. Harrell and her children continue to be the only African-American family in their neighborhood. Her other neighbors have been supportive, she said, and the family never considered moving away.</p>
        <p>''I'm a very religious person,'' Ms. Harrell said. ''I'm not going to live my life in fear. The only person who can move me is God.''</p>
