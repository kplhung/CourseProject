        <p>Spinal Fluid</p>
        <p>Q.  What organ produces spinal fluid? Should people eat certain foods to make sure there is enough?</p>
        <p>A.  Spinal fluid, or more properly cerebrospinal fluid, is chiefly produced by a network of veins, called the choroid plexus, that projects in tufted, fringelike folds into the pia mater, the innermost of the three membranes, or meninges, that cover the brain and spinal cord.</p>
        <p>The fluid is clear and colorless and contains small amounts of glucose and protein. Beyond eating a healthy diet and drinking enough water to maintain a proper fluid balance, there are no specific nutritional recommendations for making sure there is enough spinal fluid.</p>
        <p>There is a fairly complex circulation pattern for spinal fluid, which flows through the central canal of the spinal cord, in the cavities, or ventricles, of the brain and into the space under the meninges, called the subarachnoid space. The fluid is eventually absorbed into the venous system.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, spinal fluid leaks or is drawn out in a spinal tap. Usually, the chief danger is not the loss of the fluid, but the possibility of infection by contamination from outside the body. A constant, sustained leak could cause low fluid pressure, which can lead to chronic headaches; it would probably require surgical correction.</p>
