        <p>1866  Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, proposes that discrete, hereditary units he calls factors are passed down along family lines to produce recognizable traits. The factors are later termed genes.</p>
        <p>1910  In studies of the fruit fly, Drosophila, Dr. Thomas Hunt Morgan, a Columbia University researcher, proves that genes are carried on chromosomes. Later, he determines that genes lie in a linear order on chromosomes and that their positions can be mapped.</p>
        <p>1926  Hermann J. Muller discovers that X-rays induce genetic mutations and hereditary changes in fruit flies.</p>
        <p>1944  Researchers at the Rockefeller Institute prove that genes are made of deoxyribonucleic acid by mixing pneumonia bacteria (pneumococcus) with foreign DNA to induce inheritable traits. It had been thought that proteins were the probable genetic material.</p>
        <p>1953  Dr. James D. Watson and Dr. Francis Crick, aided by the work of Rosalind Franklin and Dr. Maurice Wilkins, discern the structure of the DNA molecule: two strands of nucleotides (sugars, phosphate groups and bases) spiraling around each other in a double helix. The molecule's shape allows it to unwind and act as a template for replication and transcription.</p>
        <p>1960  Dr. Sydney Brenner, with Dr. Matthew Meselson and Dr. Francois Jacob, proves the existence of messenger RNA, the transcript that carries the genetic message from DNA to the cell's protein-making factories.</p>
        <p>1961  Dr. Brenner and Dr. Crick determine how DNA instructs cells to make specific proteins. The code is the same in organisms as diverse as viruses, bacteria, plants and animals (people). The universality of the code will ultimately allow scientists to transfer DNA from one organism to another.</p>
        <p>1970  A new class of molecule is discovered. These restriction enzymes cut DNA  in specific locations.</p>
        <p>1973  A restriction enzyme is used to cut animal DNA, which is then spliced into bacteria where the gene's function is carried out.</p>
        <p>1973  Genes are transferred to bacteria, which reproduce, generating multiple copies. This cloning allows genes to be studied in detail.</p>
        <p>1977  Dr. Frederick Sanger and Dr. Walter Gilbert independently develop a technique to read the chemical bases of DNA, adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). The technique increases, by a thousand times, the rate at which DNA information can be sequenced.</p>
        <p>1977  A virus (bacteriophage) is the first organism to have its entire genome sequenced.</p>
        <p>1983  Kary Mullis develops the polymerase chain reaction P.C.R., which allows scientists to generate billions of copies of a DNA strand in a matter of hours.  1984-1986  Department of Energy officials present the idea for a large-scale effort to learn the sequence of the entire human genome. At a separate conference to discuss the project, Dr. Gilbert declares, The total human sequence is the grail of human genetics.</p>
        <p>1990  Dr. J. Craig Venter, an N.I.H. researcher, develops a shortcut method to find fragments of human genes. Based on the fragments, whole genes can be identified.</p>
        <p>1995  Dr. Hamilton O. Smith and Dr. Venter sequence the genome of a bacterium (Haemophilus influenzae). To do it, they employ Venter's shotgun method in which Dr. Smith prepares a library of clones, or chopped-up and amplified pieces of DNA, which he gives to Dr. Venter's laboratory. All the pieces of the genome are sequenced at once and reassembled later.</p>
        <p>1997-1998  Dr. Venter meets with Dr. Michael W. Hunkapiller of PE Biosystems to review an unreleased technology that greatly accelerates large-scale sequencing. Hunkapiller proposes the idea of a separate human genome project.</p>
        <p>May 1998  Dr. Venter joins a new company that plans to complete the human genome in three years, well ahead of the government's target date. The company is later named Celera.</p>
        <p>December 1998  The first full genome of an animal, the roundworm C. elegans, is sequenced by two teams of biologists headed by Dr. John E. Sulston and Dr. Robert H. Waterston. The project's success shows that large-scale sequencing is possible.</p>
        <p>March 1999  The publicly financed consortium, including the Sanger Center in England, several universities and the N.I.H., announces it will move up its target for the first draft of the human genome to the spring of 2000. N.I.H.'s contribution is led by Dr. Francis Collins.</p>
        <p>March 2000  Two groups led by Dr. Venter and Dr. Gerald M. Rubin sequence the genome of the fruit fly, Drosophila, using Dr. Venter's decoding strategy. The completion validates Celera's methods.</p>
        <p>June 2000  In what President Clinton calls a day for the ages, Celera and the public consortium say they have a working draft of the genome.</p>
