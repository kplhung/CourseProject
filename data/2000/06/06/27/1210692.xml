        <p>One day after a top commander announced a halt to artillery and air strikes in Chechnya, the Kremlin said today that the attacks would continue.</p>
        <p>The reversal raised new questions about the military's pronouncements and was a setback for the government effort to win Western understanding for its military campaign.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, the commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, Col. Gen. Gennadi Troshev, said his troops were suspending major combat operations, including air and artillery strikes. General Troshev commented after meeting Akhmad Kadyrov, the Chechen official whom President Vladimir V. Putin chose this month to administer Chechnya.</p>
        <p>''We came to the common conclusion that the war, as such, is over on the territory of Chechnya,'' General Troshev said. ''An agreement was reached that the Unified Army Group is not conducting offensive operations and not carrying out aviation or artillery strikes.''</p>
        <p>The remarks were consistent with the Kremlin's basic line that the war would soon be won and that the republic would soon return to peaceful life. But the promise of a moratorium on artillery and air strikes was new and appeared calculated to boost Mr. Kadyrov's standing with the Chechen public.</p>
        <p>Although he opposed the Russians in the first Chechen war, from 1994 to 1996, Mr. Kadyrov cooperated with Moscow after the second Russian military intervention, in September.</p>
        <p>Aslan Maskhadov, president of the breakaway Chechen republic before the intervention, has condemned him as a traitor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kadyrov has been trying to present himself as a unifying figure in Chechnya and to mobilize opposition to Mr. Maskhadov.</p>
        <p>General Troshev's comments also appeared calculated to ease Western concerns, particularly on the part of the Council of Europe. At the council, representatives have criticized the Russian military for carrying out indiscriminate attacks in Chechnya and they have discussed whether to expel Russia.</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini of Italy recently led a delegation from the council to Russia. Russian officials assured him that the military was scaling back its operations in Chechnya. Apparently persuaded, Mr. Dini said over the weekend that Moscow had declared a ''de facto cease-fire.''</p>
        <p>But today it turned out there was no cease-fire, de facto or otherwise. The bombing continued as usual, as SU-25 planes and helicopters hit rebel positions in the mountains. Russian news agencies reported that dozens of air attacks had been carried out.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Russian government, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, scrambled to explain and qualify General Troshev's comments. In an interview, Mr. Yastrzhembsky said the government was not presenting a new initiative. Rather, he suggested, General Troshev had merely been trying to describe the fact that the military is relying less on artillery and air strikes as the rebels have increasingly turned to guerrilla tactics.</p>
        <p>''There is no particular initiative, only a confirmation of the current state of affairs,'' Mr. Yastrzhembsky said, adding that he spoke to General Troshev today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yastrzhembsky said that the military would continue to use artillery, but that it ''would be conducted on rare occasions and outside of populated areas.'' Russian forces would also continue air strikes.</p>
        <p>''It is only natural that if militants are seen in the forest, we will use aviation and artillery,'' Mr. Yastrzhembsky said.</p>
        <p>A significant number of troops had been withdrawn from Chechnya, he said, but did not provide specifics.</p>
