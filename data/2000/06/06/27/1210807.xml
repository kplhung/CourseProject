        <p>For most of April and May, Mets rallies died once they got past Todd Zeile, the No. 6 hitter. When the order turned over to the No. 2 hitter, Derek Bell, then the Mets were able to start something again.</p>
        <p>Things changed when light-hitting No. 8 hitter Rey Ordonez went down to injury on May 29 and Jay Payton secured the No. 7 spot with a torrid start to June.</p>
        <p>Now, General Manager Steve Phillips said, the Mets are hitting the way they did when they surged last season.</p>
        <p>''It's more like our lineup last year, because guys are hitting,'' Phillips said. ''Last year we had some depth to our lineup, when it seemed like every inning, we at least had a chance or a threat to score.''</p>
        <p>With five home runs from hitters in the Nos. 7, 8, 9 and 1 spots, the Mets dropped the Florida Marlins, 10-5, last night at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>Benny Agbayani had two homers, and Jay Payton, Melvin Mora and pinch-hitter Mark Johnson -- batting for the winning pitcher, Al Leiter -- also went deep.</p>
        <p>It was the first five-homer game for the Mets since 1997, and Mike Piazza, Edgardo Alfonzo, Robin Ventura &amp; Co. had nothing to do with it.</p>
        <p>''You've got to have contributions from everybody to win ballgames,'' Payton said. ''You have guys who are pretty much going to carry the team, but you can't expect that every night.''</p>
        <p>The Mets had taken a 4-3 lead by the time Johnson, who was called up from Class AAA Norfolk yesterday, crushed a fastball from Joe Strong over the fence, just to the left of dead center.</p>
        <p>The homer gave the Mets a 6-3 lead, and they blew the game open with four runs in the seventh, when Payton, Agbayani and Mora all homered.</p>
        <p>Facing the right-hander Reid Cornelius in the third inning, Payton led off with a single to right, giving him a career-high seven-game hitting streak.</p>
        <p>Agbayani, batting eighth, then bashed a breaking ball into the left-field bullpen to give the Mets a 2-1 lead.</p>
        <p>After an out, the No. 1 hitter, Mora, reached on an infield single and went to second on a groundout.</p>
        <p>Alfonzo walked, and Piazza singled Mora home to put the Mets ahead by 3-1.</p>
        <p>Piazza drove in a run for the 10th game in a row, matching his club record.</p>
        <p>The lead did not last long.</p>
        <p>The Marlins scored their first run on a homer by Mike Lowell to lead off the second, and they got another bases-empty homer in the fourth, by Derrek Lee, to pull within 3-2.</p>
        <p>In the fifth, Luis Castillo ripped a leadoff single, then attempted his 33rd stolen base.</p>
        <p>Piazza received Leiter's pitch, a high fastball, and fired to second, the ball meeting Alfonzo's glove just before Castillo slid in.</p>
        <p>He was out, and he must have regretted it: Dave Berg followed with a triple and Cliff Floyd with a single.</p>
        <p>That tied the score, 3-3, but this time Cornelius could not stand the prosperity.</p>
        <p>After a one-out single by Bell in the fifth, he walked Alfonzo and Piazza to face Ventura with the bases loaded.</p>
        <p>Ventura is at his best in that situation, and while he did not hit a grand slam, he drove in a run, grounding to second to score Bell and put the Mets ahead, 4-3. In 132 career at-bats with the bases loaded, Ventura has 157 runs batted in.</p>
        <p>Cornelius, a former Met, was the losing pitcher, and he angered Agbayani in the fourth.</p>
        <p>In his first at-bat after the homer, Agbayani came to bat with two outs and no base runners and Cornelius's first pitch drilled him in the thigh.</p>
        <p>Agbayani stared at Cornelius for several seconds, raised his bat as if he were going to slam it, then tossed it aside and trotted to first.</p>
        <p>Leiter did not have the chance to retaliate against Cornelius; he had been the Marlins' last hitter the previous inning and did not come to bat again.</p>
        <p>With two outs in the seventh, Turk Wendell hit Marlins shortstop Dave Berg with a first-pitch fastball to the same area where Agbayani was hit.</p>
        <p>Leiter did not have his best slider, and he said he was a bit worn down by the humidity, but he improved to 9-1 by working six innings, allowing three runs on seven hits and three walks.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>JOHN FRANCO faced only one hitter in the eighth, and lingered on the mound longer than usual before RICH RODRIGUEZ was brought in. Franco said he was not upset, explaining that he was supposed to pitch the eighth had the game been closer. When the Mets blew the game open in the seventh, Rodriguez could not get loose in time to start the next inning.  . . . Right fielder DEREK BELL left the game in the seventh inning because of slight dehydration. . . . REY ORDONEZ had a plate inserted in his broken left forearm yesterday, and doctors also took bone marrow from his hip and grafted it onto the ulna bone to aid the healing. The plate will not come out until around Jan. 1. . . . Catcher MIKE PIAZZA is the leading National League vote-getter in balloting for the July 11 All-Star Game, but second baseman EDGARDO ALFONZO trails Houston's CRAIG BIGGIO by about 65,000 votes. (Fans have not been especially attentive this year: Ordonez is also second at shortstop.) Balloting in ballparks ends today, but fans can continue to vote online through July 1.</p>
