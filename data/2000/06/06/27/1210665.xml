        <p>Choreographically, life has not changed much for Kei Takei. From the late 1960's to the early 90's, when this Japanese-born dancer was based in New York, she was known for works depicting existence as an endless struggle. She returned to Japan in 1992 and has visited New York only occasionally since then. Yet ''The Absence of Izanagi,'' the new 35-minute solo she offered on Thursday night at the Annex at La MaMa, suggested that she remains concerned with existential ordeals.</p>
        <p>The setting designed by Akio Hayashi, an architect, placed events within an area marked off by white lines on the floor, and the confined space was dominated by posts. Ms. Takei moved laboriously within this setting to wisps of melancholy piano music by Somei Satoh and, for much of the time, Ranko Ohnishi's lighting left her face in near-darkness.</p>

        <p>Choreographically, life has not changed much for Kei Takei. From the late 1960's to the early 90's, when this Japanese-born dancer was based in New York, she was known for works depicting existence as an endless struggle. She returned to Japan in 1992 and has visited New York only occasionally since then. Yet ''The Absence of Izanagi,'' the new 35-minute solo she offered on Thursday night at the Annex at La MaMa, suggested that she remains concerned with existential ordeals.</p>
        <p>The setting designed by Akio Hayashi, an architect, placed events within an area marked off by white lines on the floor, and the confined space was dominated by posts. Ms. Takei moved laboriously within this setting to wisps of melancholy piano music by Somei Satoh and, for much of the time, Ranko Ohnishi's lighting left her face in near-darkness.</p>
        <p>Every step Ms. Takei took suggested that the woman she portrayed was exhausted. She gasped, sighed, twisted her torso and trembled. Yet despite these labors, her feet scarcely moved forward. She did manage to pass between two posts as if through a portal. But she found nothing within.</p>
        <p>Her exertions and the image of a threshold strongly recalled ''Errand Into the Maze,'' Martha Graham's often revived work of 1947 about a questing woman who ventures into a labyrinth and contends with a beast akin to the mythological monster known as the Minotaur. But this errand brought Ms. Takei to no Minotaur, and she looked despondent when she discovered that the maze remained empty.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Ms. Takei wrote that her solo was inspired by a Japanese myth of a divine male and female couple and reflected her uneasy feeling that the male principle (Izanagi) is absent from today's world. Whatever one may think of that notion philosophically, the solo conveyed a powerful sense of desolation. It will be repeated through Sunday afternoon at 66 East Fourth Street in the East Village.</p>
