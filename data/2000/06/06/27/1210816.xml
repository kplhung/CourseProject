        <p>Juan Gonzalez, who rejected a one-year contract extension to collapse a proposed three-for-one trade to the Yankees yesterday, helped the Detroit Tigers to a 13-2 victory over the Cleveland Indians last night at Jacobs Field.</p>
        <p>The two-time most valuable player went 3 for 4 with a run-scoring triple, scored twice and walked as the Tigers went 7-6 against the Indians this year, winning the season series for the first time since 1993.</p>
        <p>Instead of playing for the Yankees, Gonzalez will now face them tonight at home.</p>
        <p>Brian Moehler (5-4) pitched six and two-thirds innings for his fourth victory in six decisions. The right-hander gave up seven hits, walked three and struck out three.</p>
        <p>Tony Clark went 3 for 5 with a homer and three runs batted in and Juan Encarnacion had four hits, including a two-run double, in Detroit's four-run sixth inning.</p>
        <p>Bobby Higginson threw out two runners for the Tigers. He leads the American League with eight outfield assists.</p>
        <p>In dropping three of five to the last-place Tigers, the Indians fell eight and a half games behind first-place Chicago in the A.L. Central. Cleveland is 13-17 in a division it has dominated since 1995.</p>
        <p>TWINS 10, ANGELS 6: Matt Lawton, Ron Coomer and Jay Canizaro each homered and had two R.B.I. for visiting Minnesota.</p>
        <p>Brad Radke (5-9), who won for only the second time in seven starts, allowed two runs and six hits in six innings. He struck out two and walked two as the Twins salvaged a split of the four-game series.</p>
        <p>Jarrod Washburn (3-2), who gave up only three earned runs in 22 innings in his previous three outings, allowed eight runs and eight hits in three and a third innings -- his shortest outing in 30 major league starts.</p>
        <p>One of the runs off the left-hander was unearned because of a throwing error by Scott Spiezio, who started his third straight game at third base because of Troy Glaus's back spasms.</p>
