        <p>Good vs. Evil  It's back to the dark and hilarious days of the cold war at the Museum of Television and Radio, where Rocky the flying squirrel and his dimwitted moose pal, Bullwinkle, will again square off against the sinister though beatable Boris and Natasha.

''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends,'' a screening series from the work of Jay Ward, the television animation pioneer, runs from Friday to Sept. 17 in New York and Los Angeles and also includes ''Crusader Rabbit,'' ''Fractured Flickers,'' ''Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties'' and ''George of the Jungle.'' A degree from Wossamotta U. is not required for admission.</p>

        <p>Good vs. Evil  It's back to the dark and hilarious days of the cold war at the Museum of Television and Radio, where Rocky the flying squirrel and his dimwitted moose pal, Bullwinkle, will again square off against the sinister though beatable Boris and Natasha. But that's not all. ''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends,'' a screening series from the work of Jay Ward, the television animation pioneer, runs from Friday to Sept. 17 in New York and Los Angeles and also includes ''Crusader Rabbit,'' ''Fractured Flickers,'' ''Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties'' and ''George of the Jungle.'' A degree from Wossamotta U. is not required for admission.</p>
        <p>Season's Start  Robert Mann, who played for 51 years as a founding member of the Juilliard String Quartet, will conduct the New York Chamber Symphony at 7:30 tonight in the opening concert of the 95th season of Naumburg Orchestral Concerts at the Naumburg Band Shell, just south of East 72nd Street in Central Park. The program includes works by Copland, Beethoven and Mozart, with the pianist Steven Osborne, winner of the 1997 Walter W. Naumburg International Competition, as the soloist.</p>
        <p>Fresh Deck  Some art exists in the eye of the beholder. And one piece of art, at least, exists in the figurative hands of the shuffler. That piece is a monumental new work by Robert Rauschenberg, which is to be on display from Thursday through Oct. 8 at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Described as a performance piece as much as a painting or sculpture, ''Synapsis Shuffle'' consists of 52 silk-screen paintings on metal, from snapshots of street life to landscapes and passages of color and light. Like a deck of cards, ''Synapsis Shuffle'' is meant to be shuffled -- composed and recomposed -- each time it goes on view. Mr. Rauschenberg has stipulated that the shufflers must compose a work that consists of at least three and no more than seven panels, and each installer must be credited as the composer of that work. Those participating in the debut of ''Synapsis Shuffle'' are the singer David Byrne, the artist Chuck Close, the choreographer Merce Cunningham, the soprano Renee Fleming, the curator Walter Hopps, the art critic Robert Hughes, Mathilde Krim (Amfar's founding chairwoman), Michael Ovitz, the designer Edwin Schlossberg, the gallery owner Ileana Sonnabend, Martha Stewart and Mike Wallace of ''60 Minutes.''</p>
        <p>Verdi, Verdi, Verdi  Continuing its chronological presentation of the complete Verdi operas, the New York Grand Opera Company, under the direction of Vincent La Selva, opens its 27th season with a free, fully staged performance of No. 23, ''Un Ballo in Maschera,'' at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow at the Central Park Summerstage, at 72nd Street off Fifth Avenue. The other attractions this summer are ''La Forza del Destino'' at 6:30 p.m. on July 19 and ''Don Carlos'' at 6 p.m. on Aug. 9.</p>
