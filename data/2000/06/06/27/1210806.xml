        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: HOSPITAL BONDS DOWNGRADED  Standard &amp; Poor's has lowered its rating of Beth Israel Medical Center's bonds to junk-bond status. The bond-rating agency also placed the hospital on its list of institutions whose finances warrant close attention by bond holders. Standard &amp; Poor's cited the hospital's weak 1999 operating performance and its shortage of ready cash. Yesterday's downgrade to BB- puts the bonds in the junk category.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: BENEFIT FUNDS IN TROUBLE  Two benefit funds for New York City correction officers could slip into insolvency this year because of excessive spending by the union that runs them, Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, left, reported yesterday. The comptroller, in two audits, concluded that the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association was spending far too much on employees' legal bills and prescription drugs for retirees. Norman Seabrook, the union president, said the union was providing the legal assistance and prescription drug coverage its members deserved.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: UNION DRIVE AT LAUNDRIES  The nation's largest apparel workers union, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, announced yesterday that it planned a unionization drive at 15 industrial laundries in New York City. The drive, which includes the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, will focus first on Waltons, a Bronx-based laundry that handles the linens for several Manhattan hotels.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: ETHICS OFFICER FOR UNION  Lee Saunders, the trustee running District Council 37, New York City's largest union of municipal workers, has appointed Barbara C. Deinhardt the ethical practices officer. The 125,000-member council has been embarrassed recently by the indictment of more than two dozen officials on charges of embezzlement and vote fraud. Ms. Deinhardt, a former general counsel of the state's Department of Labor, will draft rules to enforce the ethics code and to investigate violations.</p>

        <p>GARDEN CITY: POWER FAILURE  A power failure plunged the Nassau County Legislature into darkness yesterday afternoon. The cause was apparently a small fire at a Long Island Power Authority substation. About 7,400 customers lost electricity around 2:30 p.m., but the fire was extinguished and power restored to most customers within three hours.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: OFF-TRACK BETTING  Moving to help New Jersey's horse-racing industry attract gambling dollars lost to casinos, the State Senate's Economic Growth, Agriculture and Tourism Committee yesterday approved a bill to allow off-track and phone-in betting. The bill, which has already been approved by the committee's Assembly counterpart could go to a full vote on Thursday, the last session before the Legislature's summer recess. It would let bettors watching races on television, for example, phone in bets from home.</p>

        <p>WOODBRIDGE: NEW TRAIN STATION  New Jersey Transit and Amtrak plan to build a $31 million station and improve platforms at Metropark. In the last five years, New Jersey Transit ridership has grown 17 percent and Amtrak ridership is up 40 percent at Metropark, which is on the Northeast Corridor line. New Jersey Transit will pay the $11 million cost of the platforms and an expansion of the passenger dropoff area and will share the $20 million cost of the station, which is scheduled for completion in 2004.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: AIRPORT RISK INDICATED  Air traffic controllers at Newark International Airport have asked the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to eliminate runway intersections created by a $100 million project intended to improve traffic flow. More than $100 million was spent since 1997 on lengthening runways at the airport, which created the intersections to help manage the 1,300 takeoffs and landings each day. Daniel D'Agostino, head of the Newark division of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said that planes might cross as many as five times for one takeoff. The Port Authority said it would study the request.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: OFFICERS PLEAD NOT GUILTY  Five Orange police officers pleaded not guilty yesterday to charges that they violated the civil rights of a man they mistakenly believed had killed a colleague. The man, Earl Faison, died in custody. Judge John C. Lifland of Federal District Court set trial for Aug. 29. A federal indictment accuses the five of beating, robbing and pepper-spraying Mr. Faison after he was arrested and handcuffed last year, and of then attempting to cover up their actions.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: PARADE ARRESTS  Ten people were arrested in Hartford in connection with disturbances that followed the annual Puerto Rican Day parade, the police said yesterday. Crowd members damaged cars and pelted officers with rocks and bottles in the Park Street area Sunday night, the police said, but no injuries were reported. The police said many of the thousands of people gathered in the area were intoxicated.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: SHERIFFS FILE SUIT  Connecticut's eight elected county sheriffs filed a federal civil rights lawsuit today claiming that a new state law interferes with their constitutional right to free expression and assembly. The lawsuit is the opening volley in what is expected to be a long campaign to influence a statewide referendum in November on whether to abolish the sheriff system. The new law prohibits the county sheriffs from ''directly or indirectly'' soliciting campaign contributions from any sheriff's deputy or employee, members of the employees' immediate families, or anyone who does business with the sheriffs' departments. It follows years of scandals and allegations of corruption and incompetence.</p>
