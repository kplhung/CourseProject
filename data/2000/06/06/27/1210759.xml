        <p>Latching onto an issue emerging in political campaigns nationwide, Representative Rick A. Lazio turned his focus today to rising gasoline prices, appearing at three upstate stations to call for a repeal or suspension of some fuel taxes and, along the way, criticizing his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>It was the first time in his monthlong campaign that Mr. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, made a somewhat detailed policy proposal of his own, choosing an issue that has confounded government officials and customers. The average gas price in New York last week was $1.68, up 41 percent from the $1.18 at this time last year and the highest in raw numbers since state authorities began conducting weekly surveys in the early 1960's.</p>

        <p>Latching onto an issue emerging in political campaigns nationwide, Representative Rick A. Lazio turned his focus today to rising gasoline prices, appearing at three upstate stations to call for a repeal or suspension of some fuel taxes and, along the way, criticizing his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>It was the first time in his monthlong campaign that Mr. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, made a somewhat detailed policy proposal of his own, choosing an issue that has confounded government officials and customers. The average gas price in New York last week was $1.68, up 41 percent from the $1.18 at this time last year and the highest in raw numbers since state authorities began conducting weekly surveys in the early 1960's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio called for suspending for six months the 18.3 cents-per-gallon  federal gasoline tax. The tax includes a 4.3 cents-per-gallon surcharge that Congress enacted in 1993. Mr. Lazio said he opposed the 1993 surcharge and proposed today that it be repealed.</p>
        <p>He blamed the Clinton administration for its energy policies and accused Mrs. Clinton of not recognizing the issue's importance to state residents at a time when she has begun broadcasting a series of hard-hitting advertisements. ''While they sling mud, she has remained silent on this issue that affects all New Yorkers,'' Mr. Lazio said at a gas station in Chili, a suburb in Monroe County, which includes Rochester. ''What Mrs. Clinton needs to do is get out of the motorcade, get out of fantasyland and get in contact with the issues that are affecting real New Yorkers, the prices at the pump.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton fired back immediately, with her aides issuing statements at Mr. Lazio's appearances, criticizing what they called his previous inaction on reducing fuel prices and now offering what they said was a shortsighted solution that could jeopardize money to fix highways.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's decision to focus on such a consumer issue suggested a subtle shift in strategy. He has focused on appearances that either have made for scenic pictures or allowed him to outline his stances as if introducing himself, telling attendees what he favors -- like lower taxes and charter schools in academically poor areas -- but usually not delving into specifics.</p>
        <p>The representative also made appearances today at gas stations near Buffalo and in Syracuse to deride the high gas prices, and will continue his campaign swing on Tuesday in the Hudson Valley, again emphasizing the issue before attending a fund-raiser in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>His upstate tour followed a week of static on several fronts for the new Senate candidate, including disclosures about investments in stock options that are now in a preliminary investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and complaints about his absence from the gay pride parade in Manhattan on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has insisted that his investments are modest and above board. As for the parade, he had previously scheduled events upstate.</p>
        <p>''This administration has no energy policy; Mrs. Clinton has no energy policy,'' Mr. Lazio said in Buffalo, echoing the sentiments of Gov. George W. Bush, who seized on the gas price issue last week. Vice President Al Gore, who has attributed the price spike to gouging by big oil companies, plans on Tuesday to outline his own energy policy, stressing the use of alternative fuels.</p>
        <p>The fliers handed out by Mrs. Clinton's aides used quotes by House Republican leaders to bolster the point that repealing gasoline surcharges could be harmful. The Republicans discouraged such measures, the flier said, because they could diminish highway construction funds. Mrs. Clinton's aides again criticized Mr. Lazio for missing a vote earlier this month in the House on a bill that would have created a home heating oil reserve, another energy-related topic that has angered consumers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who missed the vote as he traveled to New York to campaign, said his vote would not have mattered on the measure, which was defeated 195-193. But Mrs. Clinton disagreed; she also criticized the idea of rolling back the gas taxes before determining the extent to which oil companies are responsible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said any loss in highway money could be replenished by tapping the federal budget surplus. He also said President Clinton had not done enough to pressure oil-producing nations to lower the price of crude oil, an assertion Mr. Clinton and Mrs. Clinton dispute.</p>
        <p>''I think if you look at what the administration has done, it certainly has exerted a lot of pressure, and we've seen two increases in supply in the last several months,'' Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference on the steps of New York City Hall. ''And I anticipate that we'll see the price beginning to drop.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''I think the more interesting questions are the relationships between the Republican Party and a lot of the big oil companies. Because if you look at the hearing that Democratic members of the House had in Illinois just a few days ago, they pointed out that there is no reason for the price to be as high as it is, particularly in the Midwest, but also in the rest of the country. I think we need to get to the bottom of whether there are any excess costs being added to the price of oil here in the United States by our domestic producers and distributors.''</p>
        <p>Industry analysts say New York's high prices result from a variety of factors, including high demand propelled by a strong economy, low supplies and an increase in the price of crude oil. Although the prices are the highest in raw dollar figures, gas prices were higher in the early 1980's, when accounting for inflation, said Peter R. Smith, an analyst with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, a state-sponsored advisory agency.</p>
        <p>Greg Voll, who owns the Mobil station here where Mr. Lazio spoke, said that despite the price increases, his sales in last year were up about 5  percent, though that might be due in part to a 5-cent discount he offers on Sundays.</p>
        <p>''This is a business area,'' said Mr. Voll, whose station is in an industrial area near the Rochester airport. ''And there is a lot more traffic.''</p>
