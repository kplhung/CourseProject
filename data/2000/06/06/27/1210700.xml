        <p>Cedric Kushner, the boxing promoter who grew up in South Africa, told a jury in federal court today that he had initially begun paying bribes to the leaders of the International Boxing Federation in 1987 to get the sanctioning organization to lift its ban on ranking boxers from South Africa.</p>
        <p>Without rankings from the I.B.F., Kushner said, the boxers he represented could not qualify for lucrative televised bouts and title fights.</p>
        <p>He said the I.B.F. executive committee had met informally in 1987 to hear the plea of one of his black African boxers, who sought to have the federation, which is based in East Orange, N.J., overturn its policy of ignoring South African fighters because of the country's racially restrictive apartheid system.</p>
        <p>Soon after, Kushner said, the I.B.F. agreed to recognize and rank black and white South African boxers and their bouts in the United States. Kushner said he paid the I.B.F. rankings chairman at the time, Colin Douglas Beavers, $10,000 after the vote and continued to give him payments of from $2,500 to $10,000 three or four times a year until 1994.</p>
        <p>Kushner said he had made the payments to Beavers in cash in the belief that they were being shared with other leaders of the sanctioning group. Asked by Jose Sierra, an assistant United States attorney prosecuting the case, why he continued to make payments, Kushner said he did so on the advice of Beavers.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'You know how it works,' '' Kushner said. '' 'They could vote to change it back.' The sense was that what you paid for didn't last forever.''</p>
        <p>Kushner's testimony came at the start of the 10th week of the bribery and racketeering trial of Robert W. Lee Sr., 66, the founder and president of the boxing federation, and his son and aide, Robert Lee Jr., 38. The two men are charged with extorting $338,000 from fighters and their managers over the last 15 years.</p>
        <p>Kushner, like the promoter Bob Arum and the boxing manager Roland Jankelson, told jurors that he made the payments to Beavers with the understanding that he was representing Lee, whom Beavers referred to constantly as ''the boss.''</p>
        <p>As Kushner began his testimony, the graying, heavyset promoter described his rise from a sixth grade education in Cape Town, through a period as a merchant seaman and a Ferris wheel operator in Asbury Park, N.J., to relative fame and fortune in the 1970's as a promoter of rock concerts featuring the Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac, Queen, the Grateful Dead and Joni Mitchell.</p>
        <p>In 1983 he began dabbling in boxing promotion. He said he had reached out to the newly created I.B.F. to try to alter the international status of South African boxers.</p>
        <p>Most of the other promoters and managers who have testified at the trial said that their payments to Beavers and other I.B.F. leaders were for specific actions by the group to favorably rate their fighters. Kushner presented his payments as part of a broader lobbying effort to improve the atmosphere in the United States for South African boxers.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was double punishment for the fighters who got no opportunity in their own country and couldn't get any opportunity elsewhere,'' said Kushner, who said he represented black and white South African boxers at the time.</p>
        <p>Kushner said he arranged for Welcome Ncita, a black South African flyweight, to present to the I.B.F. executive committee the plight of black fighters, who were forced to train without gymnasiums and used milk cartons for gloves because ''they could not afford proper gloves.''</p>
        <p>''Did you ever give cash to anyone of the I.B.F. officials besides Beavers?'' Sierra asked.</p>
        <p>''No,'' Kushner said, adding that he had alluded to meeting with Beavers in some conversations with Lee as a way of indicating to Lee that he had made some payments.</p>
        <p>Asked why he had done that, Kushner said: ''I was giving the money to make Mr. Lee happy, not Mr. Beavers. If Bob was happy, more was going to happen.''</p>
