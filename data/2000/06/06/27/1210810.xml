        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding ''Riches Hidden in Plain Sight'' (June 20): It is interest ing to note that in 1841, six years after Darwin visited the Galapagos Islands, Herman Melville also arrived there when his ship, the whaler Acushnet, put in for fresh meat and water.</p>
        <p>Melville eventually wrote ''The Encantadas,'' a short story about the islands. Whereas Darwin found evidence for evolution by natural selection, described by him in ''The Voyage of the Beagle,'' Melville found the Galapagos more desolate than ''abandoned cemeteries of long ago,'' with ''their special curse . . . that to them change never comes.''</p>

        <p>Both authors were in their 20's, and the juxtaposition of what they wrote furnishes one of the premier examples of how a scientist and a writer dealt with the same data -- Charles Darwin with observations, measurements and collections, Herman Melville with symbols that expressed his perception of the human condition.</p>
