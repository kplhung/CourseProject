        <p>The most important land conservation bill in many years is now before the United States Senate, and time is running out. The bill, which passed the House in May by a resounding margin despite the opposition of the House Republican leadership, would set aside nearly $3 billion a year, most of it guaranteed, to buy parks and open space, provide wildlife protection and restore damaged coastlines. The House bill was largely the handiwork of two members who rarely agree on anything -- California's George Miller, a Democrat and staunch conservationist, and Alaska's Don Young, a Republican who has been fighting environmentalists for most of his career but who, on the verge of retirement, has done a surprising about-face.</p>
        <p>A similar burst of bipartisan harmony will be necessary to get the bill through the Senate before the political campaign swings into high gear and makes meaningful legislation all but impossible. If they can reconcile their differences, senators as diverse in philosophy as Frank Murkowski of Alaska, who often tangles with environmentalists, and the more liberal Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico can both emerge as heroes.</p>

        <p>The most important land conservation bill in many years is now before the United States Senate, and time is running out. The bill, which passed the House in May by a resounding margin despite the opposition of the House Republican leadership, would set aside nearly $3 billion a year, most of it guaranteed, to buy parks and open space, provide wildlife protection and restore damaged coastlines. The House bill was largely the handiwork of two members who rarely agree on anything -- California's George Miller, a Democrat and staunch conservationist, and Alaska's Don Young, a Republican who has been fighting environmentalists for most of his career but who, on the verge of retirement, has done a surprising about-face.</p>
        <p>A similar burst of bipartisan harmony will be necessary to get the bill through the Senate before the political campaign swings into high gear and makes meaningful legislation all but impossible. If they can reconcile their differences, senators as diverse in philosophy as Frank Murkowski of Alaska, who often tangles with environmentalists, and the more liberal Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico can both emerge as heroes.</p>
        <p>The bill will not impose new taxes. For its financing it relies on the same mechanism that has underwritten the government's main land acquisition program, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, for 35 years -- royalties from offshore oil production, mainly in the Gulf of Mexico. These royalties now amount to about $4 billion annually, of which three-fourths would be applied to this bill. There is an interesting symmetry here -- dollars raised by depleting one natural resource would be used to protect others.</p>
        <p>Among other things, the bill would help cities develop parks and recreation areas, compensate state and local governments for lost tax revenue when they buy land from private owners, and offer incentives for improving habitat for endangered wildlife. But it is the two main sections of the bill that most concern the administration, which generally supports the measure, and are most at issue in the Senate. One section would beef up the Land and Water Conservation Fund by dividing $900 million between the federal government and the states to buy ecologically valuable land. The other section would provide $1 billion in aid to states like Louisiana and Alaska, ostensibly to restore coastal areas damaged by offshore drilling operations.</p>
        <p>Both sections need work. As presently written, neither the House nor Senate version guarantees funding for federal purchases under the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It is the only part of the bill where funding is not guaranteed, reflecting the bias of many Western senators and property rights advocates against further enlargement of public lands. This must be fixed. Some of the most important public purchases in recent years -- protecting Yellowstone National Park and buying up the Headwaters redwood forest, for example -- have been federal projects.</p>
        <p>The coastal provision, meanwhile, is flawed by loose language that could actually allow states to build the kind of infrastructure projects like roads and port facilities that ruined the coastlines in the first place. This is exactly what the bill should not allow. In Louisiana, for example, the roads, pipelines and navigation channels built by the offshore oil industry have created havoc in the Mississippi Delta, where fisheries are declining and wetlands are disappearing at a rate of 20,000 acres a year. The language must be tightened to insure that the money is earmarked exclusively for restoration purposes with strict federal accountability.</p>
        <p>These fixes would turn what is now an ambitious bill into a measure of lasting consequence.</p>
