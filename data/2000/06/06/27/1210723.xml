        <p>TECHNOLOGY keeps bringing us new hopes and fears, a perfect example being the announcement yesterday that scientists had decoded the human genome.

        <p>TECHNOLOGY keeps bringing us new hopes and fears, a perfect example being the announcement yesterday that scientists had decoded the human genome. Now we have all these giant questions to ponder, like whether the deciphering of the genetic code will be used to find a cure for cancer or be hijacked by some mad scientist out to create an entire race of Martha Stewarts.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, such worries are someone else's department. Fact is, until recently we thought that ''genome'' was a misspelled reference to Rumpelstiltskin and his kind.</p>
        <p>This space is better equipped to discuss the social and ethical implications of truly meaningful technological change. Like the new telephone that the bosses installed a while back.</p>
        <p>What a telephone! It can do just about everything except hum the ''Marseillaise.'' It even has a little panel on top that identifies the incoming number when the phone rings, a device that can come in handy when you're trying to duck people like the bookie wanting to know when you plan to come up with the vig.</p>
        <p>But for months, the panel's flashing of one number after another has presented a social dilemma. What is the correct response when you know off the bat who is calling? Do you pick up the phone all knowing and jolly: ''Hey, Jim, wussup?'' Or do you offer a no-frills hello and let the other person go through the familiar motions of identifying himself?</p>
        <p>This is a profound issue of daily consequence that technological advances have wrought. Forget the genome.</p>
        <p>Perplexed, we turned to our etiquette guru, Letitia Baldrige. She recommended the more traditional approach. ''Be very nondescript,'' Ms. Baldrige counseled. ''Less is more. The less information we give out, the better.''</p>
        <p>That was the thinking, too, of Virginia Russell, marketing director at Gibbs Training and Consulting, an offshoot of the venerable Katharine Gibbs School. Ms. Russell, who developed a course on telephone skills for businesses, recalled how a law firm had complained to her that its employees were too informal in answering the phone when they recognized the caller. The old ways work best, she advised.</p>
        <p>''It's an invasion of someone's space'' to use an overly familiar manner, she said.</p>
        <p>That settled that. But the discussion turned to phone manners in general, a hot topic these days, judging from the anger generated by so many cell phone users, especially the leather-lunged ones who believe that the entire bus has to hear the shopping list for dinner. What do you call those people, cell phoners or cell phonies?</p>
        <p>THE latest wrinkle is something called ear buds. You may have seen them on the street. They are tiny earpieces and microphones worn by people who can now talk and walk without the dreadful burden, poor dears, of having to hold actual cell phones. The problem for the rest of us is that it is hard to tell at first if these people are harmless (if irritating) cell phonies or possibly dangerous crazies talking to themselves.</p>
        <p>Years ago, Lily Tomlin had a one-woman show on Broadway in which she expressed the wish that all the people muttering to themselves on New York streets would pair off so that it would look as if they were having real conversations. The ear bud tribe might want to give that idea some thought.</p>
        <p>Proper phone behavior, Ms. Russell finds, is a big concern for her corporate clients. All too many employees, she said, are clueless when it comes to politeness. It hasn't dawned on them that screaming at a customer or a client is not good business.</p>
        <p>Maybe more maddening are the mechanical devices that are now universal -- automated answering systems, voice mail and the like. A lot of companies, she said, have no idea how much they drive people crazy with these gizmos, a point easily appreciated by anyone who has bounced haplessly from voice mailbox to voice mailbox, an electronic Flying Dutchman never making contact with a live human.</p>
        <p>Let's not even dwell on the vast stretches spent on hold, day in and day out. Why couldn't the genome researchers apply their talents to a truly cosmic issue, like how to recover precious minutes and hours of lost life?</p>
        <p>At least it has dawned on some companies that they need to make nice. Their act still needs work, though.</p>
        <p>One airline, trying to show how cool it is, urges you on a taped message to think of being on hold as ''quality personal time.'' You can, the voice says, ''reflect on what you've done with your life.''</p>
        <p>What is there to do after advice like that except sigh and hang up?</p>
