        <p>The JVC Jazz Festival missed its chance for a fitting Tito Puente memorial in its concert on Saturday night at Carnegie Hall. The billing was to have brought together Puente and the pianist Eddie Palmieri, two titans of Latin music who had just made an album together, ''Masterpiece,'' due for release in July. After Puente's death on May 31, the concert was split between Mr. Palmieri's group and a showcase for singers who record for the same label Mr. Palmieri does, RMM.</p>
        <p>A surprise had been planned. Midway through Mr. Palmieri's set, members of Mr. Puente's band joined Mr. Palmieri's group to play songs from ''Masterpiece.'' But the heartfelt, one-time-only summit meeting had to be cut short. The opening segment ran overlong; Mr. Palmieri indulged himself by starting his set with a long solo, and, too soon, Carnegie Hall's curfew struck. While each segment was enjoyable, the proportions were way off.</p>

        <p>The JVC Jazz Festival missed its chance for a fitting Tito Puente memorial in its concert on Saturday night at Carnegie Hall. The billing was to have brought together Puente and the pianist Eddie Palmieri, two titans of Latin music who had just made an album together, ''Masterpiece,'' due for release in July. After Puente's death on May 31, the concert was split between Mr. Palmieri's group and a showcase for singers who record for the same label Mr. Palmieri does, RMM.</p>
        <p>A surprise had been planned. Midway through Mr. Palmieri's set, members of Mr. Puente's band joined Mr. Palmieri's group to play songs from ''Masterpiece.'' But the heartfelt, one-time-only summit meeting had to be cut short. The opening segment ran overlong; Mr. Palmieri indulged himself by starting his set with a long solo, and, too soon, Carnegie Hall's curfew struck. While each segment was enjoyable, the proportions were way off.</p>
        <p>Mr. Palmieri has long been one of salsa's wild cards. He is, sometimes simultaneously, the leader of a supercharged dance band, a preserver of Afro-Caribbean traditions and an exploratory, dissonance-loving jazz pianist.</p>
        <p>His opening solo was typically mercurial. A tender romantic melody emerged out of modernist whole-tone harmonies and kept returning,  besieged by clusters and rumbles, by abrupt interruptions, by high-speed runs and trills. Through many of the gentler passages, Mr. Palmieri howled in a way that made Keith Jarrett or Glenn Gould seem dulcet.</p>
        <p>His band, with its aggressive trumpet section, joined him for songs from his most recent album, ''El Rumbero del Piano'' (RMM/Universal): ''Dueno Monte,'' a Puerto Rican bomba in praise of the bomba's African heritage, complete with a dancer in a white ruffled dress, and  ''Malaguena Salerosa'' driven by rumba percussion. Mr. Palmieri took piano solos that sowed anarchy: dissonances hurled against the beat, montuno patterns disrupted by sudden crashes, breaks while he cued the crowd to clap along.</p>
        <p>A guest jazz soloist, David Sanchez on tenor saxophone, joined the band for a piece that started with a touch of Bach and moved toward modal jazz. Mr. Sanchez was authoritative and hard-swinging; when he tried some swirling, spiraling lines, Mr. Palmieri enveloped him in a piano maelstrom.</p>
        <p>The merged bands, conducted by Jose Madera from Mr. Puente's group, echoed the 1950's mambo era that was Mr. Puente's heyday, and added some of Mr. Palmieri's modernism. They had their own tribute to tradition, with ''Ritmo Yambu,'' about a form of rumba. Mr. Palmieri, who played timbales in his teens in the hope of emulating Puente, pulled on a pair of gloves and took a flashy timbales solo. They also played a kinetic modernized mambo and a medley of ballads, sung by Michael Stuart and Herman Olivera, that had more than a touch of nostalgia.</p>
        <p>In the first part of the concert, Mr. Stuart, Domingo Quinones and Cheo Feliciano were each backed by Isidro Infante and the RMM Orchestra. Mr. Feliciano, who has been performing since the 1960's, had the crowd singing along to his older hits; his baritone represented salsa's older generation, more affable and less showy than current singers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stuart, with a cutting tenor voice that could hold its own against the brasses, pulled off some impressive, adventurous turns in his improvisations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quinones, who has a smaller voice, worked the crowd instead. He improvised verse after verse about Puerto Rican pride -- including one about a Puerto Rican flag he spotted in the second tier -- claiming musicians from Puente to Ricky Martin. The audience roared. But by stretching out his songs, he helped deprive listeners of the rare chance to hear more of the Palmieri-Puente alliance.</p>
