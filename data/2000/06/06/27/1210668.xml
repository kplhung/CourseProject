        <p>Great pop singers are deceptive. As an example, it's hard to imagine a performer who tosses off his art so routinely and at the same time reenacts such emotional depth as Ray Charles.</p>
        <p>This is a matter of technique: the thematic backbone of Michael Lydon's excellent recent biography, ''Ray Charles: Man and Music,'' is Mr. Charles's iron will that his music sound exactly the way he wants it to sound. In the book, the producer Sid Feller is quoted about working with Mr. Charles on the 1965 album ''Crying Time.''</p>
        <p>''Ray and I had worked out the charts weeks before,'' Mr. Feller says, ''and Ray didn't change a note. Take after take, he'd sob and crack his voice in the same places. When we talked about music, we talked quarter notes and eighth rests, not hearts and flowers. Ray never talked about feelings at all.''</p>
        <p>At Avery Fisher Hall on Friday night, playing in the JVC Jazz Festival -- in which Mr. Charles has become a regular participant -- he did what he does best. ''The Ray Charles Show,'' as it was described on the tickets, was a mixture of comedy, big-band pop and a wide swath of American song types. As an hour-and-15-minute formula, it was as smooth as silk, yet Mr. Charles's stage persona -- phrasing with impulsive stabs at the piano, pulling favorite phrases out of the air like ''every now and then'' as he eased into a tune -- led the crowd to believe that he was winging it.</p>
        <p>As a singer, he has become more profound. The cracks and sobs in Mr. Charles's voice that Mr. Feller described are now craters and giant shudders, and he still makes them work. In front of the Count Basie-like arrangements of his orchestra, he sometimes made entire phrases disappear into a toneless, gritty exhalation; in one song he extended the word ''sweet,'' cracking all the way, for nearly four bars. He makes himself old, vulnerable and lost, and then snaps back into tune and rhythm. It's a phenomenal act.</p>
        <p>Mr. Charles's set encompassed early Hollywood songs (Irving Berlin's ''Marie''); Broadway tunes (Meredith Willson's ''Till There Was You,'' from ''The Music Man''; Lerner and Loewe's ''Almost Like Being in Love,'' from ''Brigadoon''); Nashville pop (Don Gibson's ''I Can't Stop Loving You); rhythm and blues (his own ''Busted,'' ''Hit the Road Jack'' and ''Teardrops from My Eyes,'' made famous by Ruth Brown).</p>
        <p>In ''Guess Who I Saw Today,'' Mr. Charles and his five backup singers, the Raelets, enacted an unfaithful-husband story, with Mr. Charles firing off sly asides. In ''Georgia on My Mind,'' playing improvised fills on his electric piano, he almost defied gravity, considering how often he has done it and how it still sounds as if it's an emotional experience. It was the highest edge of professionalism -- nothing more, nothing less.</p>
        <p>At a neat quarter-hour before the hall's union curfew, the voice of Mr. Charles's announcer boomed forth.  ''You have been entertained by the legendary genius of soul!'' he said, and without an encore, the concise, cohesive little play was finished.</p>
