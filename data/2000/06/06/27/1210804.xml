        <p>In his first news conference since his installation as New York's ninth archbishop last week, Archbishop Edward M. Egan said yesterday that he planned frequent visits to parishes throughout the archdiocese, as a way of grasping the troubles and strengths of the vast network of churches and schools he now heads, and which he is expected to streamline.</p>
        <p>The archbishop, speaking on the eve of his first trip to the Vatican as head of the Roman Catholic Church in New York, also called for an end to the American military's use of the Puerto Rican island of Vieques for bombing practice, and said, in several ways, that he valued Hispanic culture and communities.</p>
        <p>Comprising 36 percent of the archdiocese's 2.4 million Catholics, Hispanics represent the single largest ethnic block of the archdiocese, which covers Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and seven counties north of the city.</p>
        <p>The archbishop, who is expected to be made a cardinal later this year, is to fly to Rome today. On Thursday, the feast day of St. Peter, the archbishop is to receive the white woolen pallium with black crosses, a vestment that he will wear around his neck when he says Mass.</p>
        <p>The pallium, dipped in an urn over the spot where many Catholics believe St. Peter is buried, is a symbol of the pope's spiritual link to St. Peter, and of the archbishop's tie to St. Peter and to the pope.</p>
        <p>Though Archbishop Egan is running the New York Archdiocese now, Bridgeport, Conn., his last assignment, appeared to remain strong in his heart and mind. Several times yesterday, the archbishop referred to the practices and accomplishments that marked his dozen years there, and the entourage for his trip to Rome will include auxiliary bishops and other officials from both the Bridgeport and New York dioceses.</p>
        <p>In response to a question, the archbishop said that he believed the priesthood was getting a ''bad rap'' as a result of lawsuits alleging that five priests in the Bridgeport Diocese had abused children. In his first substantive public statements on the suits, Archbishop Egan acknowledged that ''there have been cases that do have substance.''</p>
        <p>But in contrast with guidelines from the National Conference of Catholic Bishops urging bishops to minister to the victims of sexual abuse by priests, Archbishop Egan offered no words of comfort or apology to more than a score of plaintiffs who are suing his former diocese for $44 million. Most of the abuse alleged in the lawsuits occurred in the 1970's and 80's. The suits have been going on for more than seven years, and the archbishop said he believed some of the accusations were groundless.</p>
        <p>''The fact that the amount of attention given to it, when it's a Catholic priest vs. when it's a minister or a rabbi or the school system or the court system, does sort of upset one,'' the archbishop said. ''Why is the focus always on this particular issue? Yes, it has done damage.''</p>
        <p>He described that damage as difficulty in recruiting priests and maintaining an esprit de corps, and he said he believed that psychological screening of candidates for the priesthood made abuse less likely nowadays. ''I believe the number-one step is, we want to strengthen the number of priests we have in this diocese,'' he said, ''to get our priests to have a sense of oneness, a sense of unity, a sense of mutual support, and of dealing with this other element.''</p>
        <p>On other issues, however, Archbishop Egan avoided wading into controversy. He did not rule out closing schools or parishes in the archdiocese to reflect demographic or economic changes. Asked whether he had a ''personal commitment'' to keeping Catholic schools open in minority neighborhoods, the archbishop said: ''Yes. However, I do believe we have to stay within our financial possibilities.''</p>
        <p>He said keeping some schools open in poor areas of the Bridgeport Diocese took ''fancy footwork over the first couple of years,'' and he added that he was in no rush to shutter Catholic schools in New York.</p>
        <p>''Give me a little time,'' Archbishop Egan said, adding that he was ''not negative about these schools.''</p>
        <p>''The schools mean an awful lot to me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Addressing speculation that the pope would like to see the head of New York's archdiocese made a cardinal, perhaps this fall, the archbishop said, ''I think the Holy Father should be encouraged in this way of thinking.'' Cardinals make up the highest rank in the Roman Catholic church after the pope.</p>
