        <p>The Jets will hold a workout today for receiver Sean Dawkins, who was recently released by the Seattle Seahawks, for whom he caught 58 passes for 992 yards and 7 touchdowns in 1999.</p>
        <p>The Jets are interested in Dawkins, 29, because with the start of training camp just two weeks away, they have not yet signed a receiver to fill out their receiving corps, which this season will be without the traded Keyshawn Johnson.</p>

        <p>In a seven-year career that began with Indianapolis and included a season apiece in New Orleans and Seattle, Dawkins has averaged more than 50 receptions a year. At 6-4, he could be the big receiver the Jets seek.</p>
