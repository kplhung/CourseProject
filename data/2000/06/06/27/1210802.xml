        <p>President Clinton raised his projection of the federal budget surplus today by nearly $1.3 trillion for the next decade, putting a breathtaking sum of new money on the table as the two parties and their presidential candidates battle over tax cuts, spending and how to prepare for the nation's long-term challenges.</p>
        <p>''How we use these surpluses in this moment of prosperity will determine America's future for decades to come,'' Mr. Clinton told reporters in the Rose Garden.</p>
        <p>The new estimate put up for political grabs an amount of money two and a half times greater than what the White House had projected less than five months ago.</p>
        <p>The robust forecast is the latest result of a strong economy that is rewriting the budget outlook on an almost continuous basis by recasting projections for years to come, even though events could easily undermine those projections.</p>
        <p>And those assumptions are promoting an economy that has shown tentative signs of slowing in recent months.</p>
        <p>The new estimate brought the total surplus projection to slightly less than $4.2 trillion for 2001 through 2010.</p>
        <p>Of that, $2.3 trillion is projected to come from the Social Security system and is considered by both parties to be off limits for tax cuts or spending programs.</p>
        <p>The rest -- almost $1.9 trillion, up from $746 billion under the White House's last estimate, in February -- is projected to come from general tax receipts, and is the pot of money that Democrats and Republicans are fighting over.</p>
        <p>Seeking to frame the debate over how the money should be used, Mr. Clinton immediately proposed a deal to divide part of the windfall with the Republican majority in Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said he would agree to a Republican proposal to cut taxes for married couples by roughly $250 billion over 10 years if the Republicans would go along with his $253 billion plan to add prescription drug coverage to the Medicare system of health insurance for the elderly.</p>
        <p>In setting out his budget framework, Mr. Clinton also stressed that he would put the government on a path to eliminate the $3.5 trillion national debt by 2012, a year ahead of his previous schedule, and to use part of the non-Social Security surplus to help extend the solvency of Medicare.</p>
        <p>The initial reaction to Mr. Clinton's proposed deal from the two top Republican leaders, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, fell somewhere between skeptical and dismissive.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Clinton's clear desire to bring prescription drug coverage to Medicare on his terms before leaving office in seven months, it was unclear whether the two sides would even be able to negotiate during an election season in which they are eager to highlight their differences.</p>
        <p>Still, as Mr. Clinton's offer suggested, the surplus, if it materializes, is big enough to give both parties much of what they want, and its sheer size has left Democrats and Republicans alike struggling to get a handle on the politics of potential plenty.</p>
        <p>For the last several years, divided government has led to gridlock on tax cuts and major new spending initiatives.</p>
        <p>The latest round of surplus numbers -- which are likely to be followed within days or weeks by a similar set of new projections from the Congressional Budget Office -- will only raise the stakes in the election, with both sides asserting that they have a more prudent plan for making the most of the fiscal bounty.</p>
        <p>The campaign of Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said the new figures vindicated his contention that the nation can afford the large tax cut he has proposed and still have money to create private investment accounts within Social Security, improve education and health care, build a national missile defense system and reduce the debt.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore's campaign said the new figures highlighted the benefits of fiscal responsibility and the contrast between his emphasis on shoring up Social Security and Medicare and Mr. Bush's push for a tax cut that would give most of its benefits to the wealthy.</p>
        <p>The new surplus projections are to some extent subject to changes in the economy, and any nasty economic surprise could dim the chances of the surpluses materializing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton acknowledged as much today. He said it would be a mistake to allocate all the projected surplus at this point, and he proposed a $500 billion ''reserve fund'' to be held aside until the fiscal situation becomes clearer and voters send a message about what they want to do with the money.</p>
        <p>''The projections could be wrong,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''They could be right. That's why we shouldn't spend it all now. And moreover, we're having a debate in which the two candidates have very different notions about what should be done with this moment of prosperity, and the American people ought to have some say in this.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Clinton said, the nation could not be ''blind to the fact that we have an enormous opportunity here.''</p>
        <p>The two parties have already agreed that the Social Security surplus should go only to reducing the national debt or shoring up the retirement system to help it weather the aging of the population.</p>
        <p>Nearly all the gain in the numbers released today was in the non-Social Security part of the budget, and Mr. Clinton's aides said the surplus projection was driven up by a combination of the economy's strength and an expectation that at least some of the economic improvement would be long-lasting.</p>
        <p>Since late last year, they said, the economy has performed substantially better than anticipated.</p>
        <p>Because the economy is bigger now than previously foreseen, it would generate larger-than-anticipated tax revenue even if economic growth from this point on does not exceed the rates that the White House had assumed earlier this year.</p>
        <p>But the White House's Office of Management and Budget also revised upward its economic growth assumptions, reflecting a general consensus among economists that the United States is capable of higher rates of noninflationary growth than previously thought.</p>
        <p>In the 10 years covered by the projection, the administration now assumes average economic growth of 3 percent a year, up from 2.7 percent estimated by its previous budget projection, in February.</p>
        <p>Many economists think that the nation's potential noninflationary growth rate is actually closer to 4 percent.</p>
        <p>Of the total increase of $1.275 trillion in the 10-year surplus projection, $984 billion comes from the improved economic outlook.</p>
        <p>The projection also includes $375 billion in additional revenue during the decade from technical changes in the estimates of tax receipts. Those increases are offset by an $84 billion reduction in projected receipts stemming from legislation passed so far this year.</p>
        <p>Among the biggest technical changes is an upward revision in personal income tax revenues, in part from a surge in capital gains that taxpayers are reaping from stocks they have bought or been awarded by employers as part of their compensation.</p>
        <p>In offering to swap a tax reduction for his prescription drug plan, Mr. Clinton was to some extent insulating Mr. Gore and Democrats in Congress from criticism by Republicans, who accuse them of opposing popular tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Republicans have been pressing to address what they call the ''marriage penalty,'' the quirk in the tax code that leaves many two-income couples paying more in taxes than they would if they remained single. But the bills they have proposed would give tax cuts to nearly all married couples, even if they do not pay a penalty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also seemed intent on sparking one last round of negotiations with Congressional leaders.</p>
        <p>''This is a proposal for true compromise,'' he said. ''It asks each party to accept some of the positions of the other party in the name of progress.''</p>
