        <p>A series of match points led Vince Spadea from his abyss only to turn into trapdoors that teased his tortured psyche. But hour after hour, he survived the jabs at his shaken confidence and the windburn generated from Greg Rusedski's serve. Set after set, Spadea ignored the isolation of playing on Court 1 in front of the flag-waving Britons cheering their own and propped up his crumbling faith.</p>
        <p>He just kept talking to himself between each tense point, lunging for desperate lobs while tumbling on the seat of his pants and fending off doom by relying on the one element of his game that hadn't deserted him during his tour-record 21-match losing streak. Once the 19th-ranked player in the world, the free-falling Spadea still had that lion tamer's snap in his wrist.</p>
        <p>As the five-set match inched four minutes in front of the four-hour mark today, Spadea whipped a forehand from the baseline that darted in on Rusedski. On Spadea's fifth match point, the 10th-seeded Rusedski could only block a backhand volley long. At that instant, the 25-year-old Spadea raised his fists and opened his mouth in amazement as he tilted his head toward the drab skies like a farmer celebrating the end of a drought.</p>
        <p>On a first day of Wimbledon that refused to fade quietly into the night, Spadea's losing streak was snapped just before dark, at 9 p.m. And even the crowd, which supported the British transplant Rusedski, clamored to its feet in wild applause after the 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-7 (8), 9-7 victory that gave Spadea his first breath of success since October 1999.</p>
        <p>''Well, it doesn't ever come until the time when you're not ready for it,'' said Spadea, who had 31 unforced errors to Rusedski's 52. ''Then all of the sudden, you're like, 'Oh, my gosh, what's happened to me?' But it was outrageous. I thought I won 16 times, man. I felt like freaking.</p>
        <p>''It's been a rough year, a rough patch in my life in tennis. Let's just say that.''</p>
        <p>Spadea was just part of confidence reclamation day. Just before Wimbledon was christened with a drizzle that stopped play for 1 hour 45 minutes, No. 1-seeded Pete Sampras shook loose the tightness in his back and dispatched Jiri Vanek, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2. Regrouping from her humbling first-round exit a year ago, the top-seeded women's player, Martina Hingis, put away Angeles Montolio, 6-1, 6-2.</p>
        <p>''Just sometimes you have to -- you're searching for something,'' said Hingis, who was unfocused and flustered in a brief split with her mother this time last year. ''You have to find your line. You have your own ideas, your own mind. Sometimes you have to experience things. People go to school and do worse things than what I did last year.''</p>
        <p>Last year was painted as the Williams sisters' arrival. Then both vanished from sight as a Grand Slam duo after dominating the United States Open. Today, they were back together again. The fifth-seeded Venus Williams and her eighth-seeded sister, Serena, looked healed from their springtime injuries as they advanced to the second round with straight-set victories.</p>
        <p>Serena was the less polished of the two. While her sister had the French Open to find her groove, this was the first match for Serena since mid-April. She labored against her Swedish opponent, Asa Carlsson, in a 15-minute first game to hold serve, but swiftly regained her confidence in a 6-3, 6-2 victory. With blond streaks in a mane bound into a ponytail by a feathery tie, she looked at ease in an environment she once believed was too stuffy for her style.</p>
        <p>''If I did feel that way, I tell you one thing, I don't feel that way now,'' Serena Williams said. ''I feel free. I can breathe. I can breathe freely. This is really my surface. I play a fast game. I can't believe it if I ever felt that way. I should be dominating here.''</p>
        <p>She just might. But this wasn't a day marked by the way the stars cruised, but about the tension created once the tarps were peeled off the grass to clear space for two players who have been mental wrecks for months.</p>
        <p>On Court 1, there was the anguished Spadea. On Center Court, there was the Web site darling Anna Kournikova, the only player capable of appearing sun-kissed under the tank-gray skies but prone to turn ashen under the horror of game pressure. Opposite 10th-seeded Sandrine Testud, Kournikova was trying to silence the cynics who sniggle at her tennis and chide her glam-girl status. She was trying to stop a yearlong ranking slide that left her unseeded at Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>It was closing in on 8 p.m. when the rubbernecking between Spadea's match and that of Kournikova bordered on ridiculous. At the same minute, Spadea and Kournikova had match points. Relief was so close. Kournikova, who had frittered away service in the second and third sets with nervous double faults and timid ground strokes, finally composed herself. On Kournikova's fourth match point, Testud sent a backhand into the net that allowed Kournikova to escape with the upset, 7-5, 5-7, 6-4.</p>
        <p>''I don't really pay attention to what's going on around me,'' said Kournikova, who peaked with a No. 10 ranking one year ago but has since tumbled to 19th. ''I kind of have a thick skin.''</p>
        <p>So do her opponents, who are continually asked about Kournikova's popularity. A testy Testud was not in the mood for it.</p>
        <p>''I'm not looking and saying, 'My God, it's Anna Kournikova,' '' Testud said. ''What am I supposed to say? 'Oh, she's beautiful.' What? I don't understand. I'm playing another player. She's a good player.''</p>
        <p>But not an especially steady one under pressure. But both she and Spadea were survivors today. One hour later than Kournikova, Spadea finally tucked away his last match point of the evening, too. ''My parents left,'' said Spadea, a resident of Florida. ''My parents went home two days ago. They saw the draw and said, 'Vince, man, good luck, but I don't know if that will help you.' They're in Miami right now, on the Internet, breaking the keyboard.''</p>
        <p>No doubt they are sending e-mail to everyone: the drought is over. Everyone at Court 1 knew it. As Spadea exited the scene after soaking it in, a bodyguard hugged him, as did John McEnroe, the United States Davis Cup team captain.</p>
        <p>''When he did that, I felt like my kid was born or something,'' Spadea said. ''You know what I mean? That was a great feeling, man.</p>
        <p>''I guess it's a major weight taken off me. I wasn't sweating it, though. Everyone was making a big deal about it. I wasn't even counting anyway or bringing a calculator. I'm not even analyzing the monkey I had on my back. I mean, I'm just focused on the fact that this will be a great memory no matter what happens to me this year.''</p>
