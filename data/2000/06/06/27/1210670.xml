        <p>To be sure, Shakespeare did put a chorus in ''Romeo and Juliet'' to speak a few scene-setting lines before the first two acts, then to be forgotten; and most directors forget him entirely. Not so Gregory Wolfe, the director of Moonwork's majestic production. He has a chorus from Greek tragedy in mind -- 22 actors embodying what Mr. Wolfe takes to be the audience's reaction to the tragedy.</p>
        <p>In fact, dressed entirely in white cowled robes and ranked on three rising tiers at the back of the stage, this ensemble looks more like a choir of stone saints rising above a great medieval altar. In its incantations and rhythmic sighs and whispers it puts one more in mind of religious hymns and choral passages in opera than of the running commentary of choruses in Greek plays.</p>

        <p>To be sure, Shakespeare did put a chorus in ''Romeo and Juliet'' to speak a few scene-setting lines before the first two acts, then to be forgotten; and most directors forget him entirely. Not so Gregory Wolfe, the director of Moonwork's majestic production. He has a chorus from Greek tragedy in mind -- 22 actors embodying what Mr. Wolfe takes to be the audience's reaction to the tragedy.</p>
        <p>In fact, dressed entirely in white cowled robes and ranked on three rising tiers at the back of the stage, this ensemble looks more like a choir of stone saints rising above a great medieval altar. In its incantations and rhythmic sighs and whispers it puts one more in mind of religious hymns and choral passages in opera than of the running commentary of choruses in Greek plays.</p>
        <p>That such a powerful presence does not overwhelm the play -- there are only 14 actors in the roles here -- is evidence of the company's adroitness in realizing this audacious conception. The story begins with choreographed street confrontations between the warring Montagues and Capulets and elegantly stylized dancing at the Capulets' ball, scenes that almost suggest the leisure of a lavish ballet.</p>
        <p>But once Romeo and Juliet kiss, the action becomes an accelerating engine that cannot be slowed, and even the increasing involvement of the vast chorus does not distract attention often from the unstoppable tragedy. At times Mr. Wolfe and the cast strain to keep the balance.</p>
        <p>As Romeo (Gregory J. Sherman) and Juliet (Monique Vukovic) despair in isolation and misunderstanding, their shrillness is annoying if not downright vulgar. But, then, the one moment when the great chorus clearly adds to the emotional power of the plot comes in the tomb scene, where the robed figures suggest not ghosts but monuments that, for all their magnificence, cannot banish the thought of death.</p>
        <p>Other innovations have very mixed results. Conflating the prince, Escalus, with Paris, whom Juliet's father wants her to marry, produces a ripple of emotional confusion that has to leave the audience feeling manipulated by the director. Making Juliet's nurse a male role (Tom Shillue) turns out to be inspired; some of the lines are peculiarly subversive in a man's mouth.</p>
        <p>Expanding the comic appearances of the nurse's servant, Peter, is an excellent move when an actor who has the perfect timing of James O'Connor is available. And Mason Pettit gives Friar Lawrence downtown street smarts that are surprisingly appropriate.</p>
        <p>But turning the various fight scenes into ballet is a mistake, especially in the killing of Mercutio (Anna Cody, who has all the vulnerable effrontery the character calls for); the death is not credible and thus the reactions to it are out of place. The deaths leading up to the tomb scene must be seen to be real if the suicides of Romeo and Juliet are to be comprehensible.</p>
        <p>And that brings one back to this great chorus. It is splendid in appearance, fascinating to watch and, surrounded by Andrew Sherman's music, often a pleasure to hear. It is also a reminder of how passionate and committed Moonwork is and how abundant is this company's imagination.</p>
        <p>But the chorus is entirely out of place here. ''Romeo and Juliet'' is not about the universe and eternity -- elements that need the kind of witness of all humanity that a Greek chorus brings to the myths staged by the Greek dramatists. Their protagonists were the victims of gods.</p>
        <p>Shakespeare's play, and the story he took it from, are about two teenagers who do the most natural thing in the lives of young people and who are killed by the social and moral corruption of the world of their elders. We know that world.</p>
        <p>Oddly, Shakespeare's play is too modern for the chorus Moonwork has given it.</p>
