        <p>Expectations were never too high for Lavor Postell, who came to St. John's without the hype of many of his teammates. And, despite an illustrious college career, there will be no invitation for Postell to sit in the green room tomorrow night at the National Basketball Association draft, a spot reserved for the top 16 players in the draft.</p>
        <p>But don't be surprised if you hear Commissioner David Stern announce Postell's name as a first-round pick.</p>
        <p>While uncertain where he will wind up, Postell will almost certainly be drafted along with his teammates Erick Barkley and Bootsy Thornton.</p>
        <p>''It's just what you expect,'' St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis said. ''Lavor, like Erick, you look at the last two years and what his teams have done. He was instrumental. There was one player that played in every single one of those 53 wins, and that was Lavor Postell. Everybody knows, especially the players he's competing against, how good he is.''</p>
        <p>Postell impressed scouts by outworking more heralded players at every workout and predraft camp he attended. He is still working out for teams, spending yesterday in Indiana and flying last night to Seattle for his final workout.</p>
        <p>But working to the wire is no different from anything he has done since his days at Westover High School in Albany, Ga., where the toughest push came from his mother, a prison guard.</p>
        <p>At St. John's, he started every game his first two seasons, averaging 5.6 points a game as a freshman and 9.9 points as a sophomore. As a junior, Postell played a sixth-man role, a move that he accepted as being what was best for the team, even though he was not happy with it at times. He improved his scoring average to 13.1 points a game, and was even named to the National Collegiate Athletic Association South Regional all-tournament team after scoring 24 points against Ohio State.</p>
        <p>As a senior captain last season, Postell stepped back into the starting lineup, averaging 14.3 points and a team-high 6.9 rebounds. Listed at  6 feet 6 inches, he played small forward and often defended much taller players; he made up for what he lacked in size with toughness and hustle. And he accomplished just as much off the floor, earning the Big East Conference's scholar-athlete award.</p>
        <p>At the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament in Virginia in April, Postell averaged 18.7 points and was named to an all-tournament team. Then, after a so-so performance at the Phoenix Desert Classic, he dominated the predraft camp this month in Chicago. He led all scorers with 18.7 points a game and converted 23 of 33 field-goal attempts in three games.</p>
        <p>It was odd to see Postell atop the scoring leaders since he was never that type of player with the Red Storm, taking a back seat to Barkley and Thornton as the third-leading scorer on the team last season.</p>
        <p>''Me and Lavor and Bootsy were talking a lot in Chicago,'' Barkley said. ''We spent about three hours with Lavor telling me about the good camp he had, because I wasn't there. I told him I was happy for him and wish him the best. Bootsy had a good camp, too. I just told them, 'Good luck and be happy no matter where you go.' That's how I feel; it don't matter where you go, as long as you're happy.''</p>
        <p>Referring to Postell, Marty Blake, who runs the N.B.A.'s scouting services, said: ''He had a good college career, but he never got the publicity. It was Barkley this year, Ron Artest last year. It always seemed like he was the fourth or fifth option on his team. But he'll be drafted, and he'll get an opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Seattle could use a player who fits Postell's description, a defensive-minded shooting guard. The Sonics hold the 17th pick in the first round and the 42nd overall pick. Phoenix, which holds the No. 25 pick, and Utah at No. 23 have also shown interest. Postell worked out for the Knicks, who were impressed by his conditioning and work ethic, but he would not seem to fill any of their needs.</p>
        <p>''There are some people seriously considering Lavor late in the first round, teams with specific needs,'' Jarvis said. ''They're looking at Lavor as a guy who can hit a jumper, come off the bench, rebound. He's done nothing but raise his stock.</p>
        <p>''They still could pass something up, but I think he'll be in the N.B.A., and that's all that counts in the end. Where you get picked is not as important as where you end up. Barring injuries or some other unforeseen thing, normally the cream will rise to the top. He's the kind of kid that's going to make some team very happy that he's on their team. If you have a kid like Lavor coming off your bench, that's pretty good.''</p>
