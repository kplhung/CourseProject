      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Supreme Court yesterday reaffirmed one of the finest legacies of Chief Justice Earl Warren's era -- the court's Miranda ruling of 1966, which requires police to advise suspects of their rights before beginning an interrogation. Seven members of the court chose to uphold Miranda's constitutional vitality, and the majority decision was written by one of the court's more conservative members, Chief Justice William Rehnquist. That should help discourage future efforts to portray Miranda's sensible safeguards against coercion as an extreme and extraconstitutional ''milestone of judicial overreaching,'' which is how Justice Antonin Scalia sought to depict them in a dissent joined by Justice Clarence Thomas.</p>
        <p>The case arose from an appellate court ruling in Virginia last year. That court said that courts were no longer obliged to exclude evidence in federal cases when the police neglect to remind suspects that they have a right to have a lawyer present and to remain silent, and that any statement they make can be used against them -- a legal incantation that most viewers of television crime shows can recite by heart. The appellate decision rested on an obscure 1968 law providing that a confession is admissible as long as it is ''voluntarily given'' in light of ''all the circumstances'' -- regardless of whether the suspect was read his rights.</p>

        <p>The Supreme Court yesterday reaffirmed one of the finest legacies of Chief Justice Earl Warren's era -- the court's Miranda ruling of 1966, which requires police to advise suspects of their rights before beginning an interrogation. Seven members of the court chose to uphold Miranda's constitutional vitality, and the majority decision was written by one of the court's more conservative members, Chief Justice William Rehnquist. That should help discourage future efforts to portray Miranda's sensible safeguards against coercion as an extreme and extraconstitutional ''milestone of judicial overreaching,'' which is how Justice Antonin Scalia sought to depict them in a dissent joined by Justice Clarence Thomas.</p>
        <p>The case arose from an appellate court ruling in Virginia last year. That court said that courts were no longer obliged to exclude evidence in federal cases when the police neglect to remind suspects that they have a right to have a lawyer present and to remain silent, and that any statement they make can be used against them -- a legal incantation that most viewers of television crime shows can recite by heart. The appellate decision rested on an obscure 1968 law providing that a confession is admissible as long as it is ''voluntarily given'' in light of ''all the circumstances'' -- regardless of whether the suspect was read his rights.</p>
        <p>But as the court has now ruled, the core principles of Miranda are grounded in the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination and the 14th Amendment's promise of due process. Thus Congress cannot undo it. As the chief justice noted,  ''Miranda, being a constitutional decision of this court, may not be in effect overruled by an act of Congress.'' In declining the invitation to overrule Miranda, the court also said that a departure from precedent required extraordinary circumstances not present in the case at hand. The court confessed that it might not have imposed the Miranda rule were it addressing the issue for the first time. Nevertheless, it wisely decided against tampering with a rule that has added an important measure of consistency and fairness to police work, and has  ''become part of our national culture.''</p>
        <p>In another important ruling yesterday, the court invalidated California's ''blanket'' primary. Under this system, Californians were given a single ballot from which they could choose a candidate from any party, regardless of their own party affiliation. The court found this system to be a violation of the parties' rights of association -- that is, each party's right to control its nominating process. The question of whether the associational rights of political parties should take precedence over the state's countervailing First Amendment interest in encouraging broad voter participation is a closer call than the court's 7-to-2 split suggests. The political parties have a strong interest in defining their identity. But the nomination process is not a private matter, but an integral part of the system for choosing government officials.</p>
        <p>The court studiously avoided applying its ruling to the 20 states that use a less drastic form of open primary to choose candidates, so the new ruling is unlikely to be the last word on the matter.</p>
