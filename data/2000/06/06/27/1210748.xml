        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton had her second City Hall news conference in four days yesterday, but this time she brought with her a slight young woman who listened quietly on the edge of the crowd: Chelsea Clinton, her 20-year-old daughter, who said she would be campaigning on and off with her mother this summer.</p>
        <p>''You'll be seeing some of me,'' Ms. Clinton said shyly to reporters who suddenly noticed her standing in their midst. She added that she finished her junior year at Stanford University two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>As brief as they were, Ms. Clinton's words were nonetheless rare comments from a daughter whose parents have aggressively shielded her from the press for most of the seven and a half years that the family has lived in the White House, and she rarely appeared at her father's side during his campaigns.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was the second time that Ms. Clinton has appeared in public with her mother since the first lady began running for Senate. The first time was at Mrs. Clinton's campaign announcement speech in February at the State University of New York in Purchase, where Ms. Clinton also appeared as a baby in a campaign video about her mother's life.</p>
        <p>And although the news conference was called to publicize the plight of 13 Iranian Jews accused of spying for Israel -- and also to put the Democratic Senate candidate in the same picture frame as Malcolm Hoenlein, the conservative and influential Jewish leader -- one of the first questions to Mrs. Clinton was about her daughter's plans to campaign.</p>
        <p>''She's going to be coming and going as she chooses,'' Mrs. Clinton replied. ''I believe in permitting her to make those decisions. And you'll see her sometimes, which will be a delight for me, and that's all I can tell you.''</p>
        <p>In recent months, the Clintons' daughter has moved slowly but increasingly into more of a public role. Last week, she stood in for the first time for her mother at a White House arrival ceremony for King Mohammed VI of Morocco. Although Mrs. Clinton, who was campaigning in New York, made it to Washington in time for the state dinner, it was her daughter who stood by the president's side and formally welcomed the king and his sister, Princess Lalla Meryem, as a 21-gun salute and a trumpet fanfare sounded on the South Lawn.</p>
        <p>Last March, Ms. Clinton accompanied her father on a trip to South Asia, and stood in for her mother at a formal arrival ceremony at the presidential palace in New Delhi. Last summer, she vacationed with her parents in the otherwise sleepy Finger Lakes resort town of Skaneateles, and was mobbed by reporters when she ventured downtown to the library.</p>
        <p>But in recent years, her most conspicuous public role was to walk between her parents, holding their hands, as they left the White House for a summer vacation on Martha's Vineyard in August 1998 immediately after her father's public admission that he had had an affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. While on the Vineyard, Ms. Clinton surfaced a few times in public, poised and gracious.</p>
        <p>After the news conference yesterday, held under a sweltering sun on the City Hall steps, Ms. Clinton and her mother went separate ways -- Mrs. Clinton to a meeting with Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the New York Assembly, and Ms. Clinton to undisclosed places ''to do whatever 20-year-olds do in New York City,'' as one of her mother's campaign aides put it.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton appeared at the news conference with Mr. Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, and also with Mr. Silver and Peter F. Vallone, the speaker of the City Council. Mrs. Clinton termed the trial of the Jews in Iran a ''miscarriage of justice'' and called upon the government to release them, including a 17-year-old boy.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's former opponent in the Senate race, held a similar news conference with Mr. Hoenlein and other Jewish leaders on April 14. Yesterday, Mr. Hoenlein said that ''this is not a political issue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani and his senior advisers were absent from City Hall yesterday for a daylong retreat in Queens to discuss initiatives for the mayor's remaining 18 months in office. Mr. Giuliani did happen to be present in the building last Thursday when Mrs. Clinton had her first news conference on the City Hall steps, but the mayor and the first lady carefully avoided each other.</p>
