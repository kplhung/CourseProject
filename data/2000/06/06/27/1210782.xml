        <p>I.R.A. Arms Caches Inspected  Two international envoys, one from Finland and the other from Africa, inspected a number of the guerrillas' secret arms dumps, a significant step in advancing the Northern Ireland peace settlement. The inspections fulfilled a promise made by the I.R.A. in May in response to demands that it move toward dismantling its arsenal in exchange for Britain's restoring the authority of the new Catholic-Protestant power-sharing Northern Ireland government.</p>

        <p>Court Upholds Miranda Rule As Part of the 'Culture'  The Supreme Court, voting 7 to 2, reaffirmed the Miranda decision on the required police warnings to suspects about their rights. In an opinion by Chief Justice William H.

        <p>The court declared New Jersey's hate crime law unconstitutional, on the twin grounds that it improperly permitted the judge, rather than the jury, to make the crucial finding that the crime was motivated by bias, and that it did not require proof of that beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

        <p>Bush Would Split I.N.S.  Gov. George W. Bush proposed the splitting of the Immigration and Naturalization Service into two separate agencies, one to deal with law enforcement and the other to provide services to immigrants.

        <p>Power Cuts on East Side  Problems with feeder cables led Con Edison to reduce power by 8 percent to an Upper East Side area with 76,000 customers. Power was cut off to six buildings, and two hospitals and the Metropolitan Museum of Art were asked to switch to their own generators. Power usage in the city for the day was the third highest on record, the utility said. Power was restored by 11 p.m.</p>
