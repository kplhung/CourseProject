        <p>The Supreme Court declared New Jersey's hate crime law unconstitutional today on the twin grounds that it improperly permitted the judge, rather than the jury, to make the crucial finding that the crime was motivated by bias and that it did not require proof of that finding beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
        <p>The 5-to-4 decision will have only a modest impact in the area of hate crime legislation because most states already require a jury to make the finding of motive under the reasonable doubt standard.</p>
        <p>But the decision opens the door to challenges to sentencing procedures in many other contexts, including federal drug sentences and even the structure of the federal sentencing guidelines themselves, in which the jury determines guilt and the judge makes many essentially factual determinations that lead to the final sentence.</p>
        <p>As the dissenters warned today,  and the justices in the majority did not dispute, the decision could cause widespread ferment in criminal sentencing. The four dissenters said the decision marked ''a watershed change in constitutional law.''</p>
        <p>With five separate opinions totalling 106 pages, the decision, Apprendi v. New Jersey, No. 99-478, was one of the most closely fought and in some respects surprising of the term. The case cut across the court's usual ideological lines. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justices Scalia and Thomas also filed concurring opinions.</p>
        <p>The dissenters were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen G. Breyer, who each wrote dissenting opinions, along with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Anthony M. Kennedy.</p>
        <p>The court had been pointing in this direction in recent decisions, but the majority opinion put the holding starkly and unequivocally: ''Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.''</p>
        <p>The New Jersey hate crime law is similar to a law in North Carolina, but differs from those of other states that make the finding of a biased motive an element of the offense that the prosecution has to charge in the indictment and prove to the jury like any other element of the crime.</p>
        <p>The hate crime bill the New York Legislature passed this month follows this latter model, as does the federal bill that cleared the Senate last week.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey law was challenged by a Vineland man, Charles C. Apprendi Jr., who had pleaded guilty in 1995 to firing several bullets into a neighboring black family's home. The maximum sentence for the firearms offense was 10 years.</p>
        <p>Under the hate crime law, the prosecutor asked the trial judge to find that the crime had been motivated by racial bias. At a hearing, Mr. Apprendi, who is white, disputed the charge, but the judge found against him and sentenced him to 12 years. The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the law in a decision last year.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court sent the case back to the New Jersey state court to reconsider the sentence.</p>
        <p>Writing for the majority today, Justice Stevens said that ''at stake in this case are constitutional protections of surpassing importance,'' the right to due process of law and the guarantee of a trial by jury.</p>
        <p>He said that it was one thing for a judge to exercise discretion within the statutory range for the offense as set by the legislature. But he said the court could not accept ''the novelty of a legislative scheme that removes the jury from the determination of a fact that, if found, exposes the criminal defendant to a penalty exceeding the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone.''</p>
        <p>Responding to the decision, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said, ''What we need to do is amend the law and put that power back in the jury.''</p>
        <p>While the majority opinion suggested that the constitutional problems could be avoided as long as any judicially imposed sentencing factors kept the final sentence within the statutory range for the offense, the dissenters expressed considerable doubt that the decision could logically be confined within those boundaries.</p>
        <p>Justice O'Connor said that if the decision meant, as it appeared to, ''that a defendant is entitled to have a jury decide, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, every fact relevant to the determination of sentence under a determinate-sentencing scheme,'' then the ruling ''will have the effect of invalidating significant sentencing reform accomplished at the federal and state levels over the past three decades.''</p>
        <p>Further, she said, the decision ''threatens to unleash a flood of petitions by convicted defendants seeking to invalidate their sentences in whole or in part.'' Justice O'Connor said the majority's failure ''to clarify the precise contours of the constitutional principle underlying its decision'' left federal and state judges ''in a state of limbo.''</p>
        <p>The court will almost immediately have a chance to indicate whether it wants to let this debate simmer in the lower courts, or assign itself the task of clarifying the full import of today's ruling. The justices have been keeping several cases involving the sentencing guidelines and, particularly, federal narcotics sentencing, on their docket while awaiting a decision in this case.</p>
        <p>The drug cases would appear to be particularly vulnerable to the majority analysis today because the jury in such cases typically finds guilt while the sentencing judge makes many crucial determinations about the type and quantity of the drugs, the harm caused by the offense and the characteristics of the offender.</p>
