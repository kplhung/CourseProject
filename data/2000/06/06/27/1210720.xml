        <p>ABC named Alex Wallau, one of its longest-serving executives, who also happens to be the network's boxing analyst, to the position of president of the ABC Television Network yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallau will be responsible for most of ABC's business and programming divisions, including news, entertainment and sports. He succeeds Patricia Fili-Krushel, who left ABC three months ago to become chief executive of the consumer division of Healtheon/WebMD.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallau, who has served as interim president since the departure of Ms. Fili-Krushel, will report to Robert Callahan, the president of the ABC Broadcast Group. Previously Mr. Wallau had been president of ABC's administration and operations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallau said yesterday that he would retain the duties of that job. ''I'm not replacing myself in that position,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallau also said he would continue to serve as the on-air analyst for boxing matches covered by ABC Sports, a role he has performed since 1986. ''I do enjoy it,'' Mr. Wallau said. ''I find boxing to be a good metaphor for being president of a network.''</p>
        <p>But he noted that ABC broadcasts very few boxing events now. Mr. Wallau did the commentary on a match on June 17, but that was the first he had done in more than a year. And he said ABC Sports had no other boxing matches scheduled at the moment.</p>
        <p>What is scheduled for Mr. Wallau is a move from New York to Los Angeles. As with other senior positions in ABC's management, the job of president was moved to Los Angeles after the network became part of the Walt Disney Company, which is in Burbank, Calif.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fili-Krushel said the necessity to move to Los Angeles was one factor in her decision to leave ABC.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallau said yesterday, ''This does mean a move to the West Coast, and I'm looking forward to that, even though I'm a New Yorker and I know I'll be moving back someday in my dotage.''</p>
        <p>He added that he would be in New York frequently since so many of the network's divisions, including news, sports, and advertising sales, would continue to be based in the city.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallau expressed confidence in the current leaders of ABC's programming division, and singled out the entertainment division under Stu Bloomberg and Lloyd Braun for being ''ahead of the pack'' in the current trend toward reality shows imported from Europe.</p>
        <p>He expressed confidence that ABC's hit game show, ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' would continue to ''have great impact.'' The show is being expanded to four nights a week starting in the fall.</p>
