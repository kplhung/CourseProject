        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>MONEY IN MAY  Big money continues to roll into the Republican Party. Data released yesterday shows that in May the party and its committees raised $12.2 million in soft money. That brought the party's fund-raising total for the 2000 election to $106 million. The Democratic soft-money totals have not yet arrived at the Federal Election Commission. But data that includes some of May's fund-raising has the Democratic soft-money total at $86.4 million. Republicans received many checks in the $200,000 and over level, with most coming from Texans and Californians, according to Public Disclosure Inc., a company that tracks campaign contributions. Texans with open checkbooks were David Saperstein of Five S Capital ($250,000), J. Virgil Waggoner of Sterling Chemicals ($250,000) and Richard D. Kinder of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners ($240,000). As a group, the other big givers were from Oregon, especially timber companies. Their combined contributions to Republicans came to $1.3 million.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>A TACTIC BACKFIRES  To help the Democrats pick up one of the six seats they need to regain control of the House, Mayor Wellington E. Webb of Denver sent out a fund-raising letter in March on behalf of Ken Toltz, the Democrat challenging Representative Thomas G. Tancredo, a freshman Republican from Colorado's Sixth District. But the letter, which urged financial support for Mr. Toltz, a businessman in his first run for office, and characterized Mr. Tancredo as ''a right-wing extremist,'' has helped raise more than $50,000 for Mr. Tancredo. His campaign mailed the same letter to Republican loyalists, hoping that other things Mr. Webb had to say, like, ''This race could decide the majority in Congress,'' might work to Mr. Tancredo's advantage. So far, it has. ''And we're not finished yet,'' said Dave Pearson, Mr. Tancredo's campaign manager. ''Money is still coming in.''</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>BUSH EXTENDS LEAD  Gov. George W. Bush is widening his lead over Vice President Al Gore in the presidential race, a new survey suggests. Mr. Bush was chosen by 52 percent of voters and Mr. Gore by 39 percent in a weekend telephone survey, according to a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released Monday. The same poll taken the week of June 5 showed Mr. Bush with 48 percent, and Mr. Gore with 44 percent, with the same margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points. That means differences of less than five points are not statistically significant. In the same poll late last month, Mr. Bush had 49 percent to Mr. Gore's 42 percent.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>LONGER TERM LIMITS FAIL  An effort to lengthen California's term limits fell well short yesterday in the State Assembly. The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Louis J. Papan, would have doubled the maximum number of two-year terms a member of the Assembly could serve, to six from three. Senators, who are permitted to serve two four-year terms, would have been permitted an additional four-year term. Mr. Papan and others said legislators were forced out of office just as they became knowledgeable about the process, about their districts and about the state's laws. The vote for the bill was 32 to 28, but it needed a two-thirds majority.</p>
