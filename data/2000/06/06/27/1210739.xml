        <p>Except for the blinking traffic light that hangs over the two-lane highway here, little remains of this tiny town's legacy as the Midwest's first and most famous black resort area.</p>
        <p>The light has long served as the only sign to travelers, mostly from Detroit, Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis and, occasionally, New York,  that they have arrived in the ''Black Eden,'' the nickname this town of winding roads took on in the late 1940's as scores of black intellectuals and entertainers bought small lakeside cottages and made it a swinging summer retreat.</p>
        <p>In the days of segregation, Idlewild, 180 miles northwest of Detroit on the edge of Manistee National Forest, was one of a handful of places where black professionals could get away and where black entertainers were accorded the accommodations and adoration that Las Vegas and Hollywood denied them.  At clubs like El Morocco, Flamingo and Paradise, summer visitors were entertained by the likes of Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Dinah Washington and Sammy Davis Jr.</p>
        <p>Much of what happened here did not make the history books, and many of the motels and nightclubs where the high-stepping took place have been erased by nearly three decades of economic abandonment.</p>
        <p>Today, there is nothing especially grand about Idlewild, unless you count the steely determination of a cadre of old-timers who have held on to the tales and photographs of the glory days and are pushing for redevelopment in the town.</p>
        <p>''Even with the history, this place has been on a down cycle for a long time,'' said John Meeks, a 78-year-old retired Detroit teacher who moved to Idlewild in 1975 after vacationing here for more than 30 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meeks, who calls himself  Idlewild's chief executive, is regarded as the architect of the area's revitalization effort. In 1989, he bought the only remaining inn, the Morton Motel, and has spent $350,000 adding  air-conditioning, heat and private bathrooms to each of the 17 rooms.</p>
        <p>The efforts of Mr. Meeks and other Idlewild enthusiasts are part of a campaign to draw visitors back to the town and rebuild its legacy with events like celebrity book-signings and concerts as well as an annual retreat for black poets. Their goal is to pass on their passion for Idlewild to a younger generation that has the money to buy homes and open businesses.</p>
        <p>''We're on the threshold of building a new and improved Idlewild,'' said Mabel Williams, 69, who is opening a  historical center. ''The blinking light is going to be a beacon again.''</p>
        <p>As proof, Mrs. Williams, and most of the other 400 year-round residents,  point to the large traffic barrels down the center of the main road. To the average driver, the barrels are covering potholes, but that is progress to local residents, because those holes mark the spots where Idlewild's first sewage system and natural gas lines are being installed. This summer, cable television is expected. Money from the state, appropriated after Idlewild was designated an empowerment zone in 1994,  and other federal grants helped pay  for the construction and repairs.</p>
        <p>Historians are beginning to take greater note of Idlewild's past, particularly its founding in 1912. That is  when a wealthy group of white Chicago developers bought 2,700 acres  from a Michigan railroad company and began marketing lots, 125 feet by 20 feet, to prominent blacks like W. E. B. Du Bois and Madame C. J. Walker, the cosmetologist considered the United States' first black female millionaire, for $35, or $6 down and $1 a week.</p>
        <p>This month, the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in Dearborn began staging re-enactments of  Idlewild's early days. Also, a University of Nebraska professor, Ronald J. Stephens, is putting together a traveling photo exhibit for next year.</p>
        <p>Despite renewed interest and visible signs of improvement, Idlewild faces equally obvious hurdles. It is part of Lake County, where 26.4 percent of the roughly 10,000 residents  live below the poverty line, more than double the state percentage, according to the 1990 census, the latest figures available. The biggest industry to come into area recently is a new prison for teenage criminals. In Idlewild, one out of five people is 65 or older, and the number of elderly residents continues to increase because most young people here head for the big cities as soon as they finish high school. For those reasons, some argue that Idlewild's vision of rebirth may be too ambitious.</p>
        <p>''Integration essentially made Idlewild a rural agricultural ghetto,'' said Benjamin C. Wilson, a black studies professor at Western Michigan University and a longtime Idlewild researcher who also owns a cottage here. ''Now that entertainers can perform anywhere, it will never be what it was. For people who aren't locked into the nostalgia of old Idlewild, there's not much reason to come. And the young people, the life of any community, leave as soon they get their credentials because it's the only way they'll find a job.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Meeks said Idlewild's  lakes and forests were too valuable  to expose them to the potential pollution of industrial companies, even if the factories could offer good jobs. ''Martha's Vineyard and Myrtle Beach didn't get to be upscale resort areas by letting smokestack businesses into their backyard,'' Mr. Meeks said. ''We won't either.''</p>
        <p>Idlewild's history, he added, demands that it become a tourist destination. ''You won't find another place in the United States with this kind of natural beauty and cultural import that still belongs to blacks,'' Mr. Meeks said, glancing at a group of children and anglers along Lake Idlewild, one of the village's five lakes. ''We can't just give it away.''</p>
