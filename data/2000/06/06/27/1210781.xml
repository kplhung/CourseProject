        <p>After Chuck Knoblauch's throwing problems erupted in the last 10 days, the Yankees shifted the top minor league prospect Alfonso Soriano from shortstop to second base, and now it appears that Soriano will be promoted to the majors to play the position.</p>
        <p>Soriano was scratched from the starting lineup for Class AAA Columbus last night, and Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, would not comment about the change. But it may be that the Yankees want to get more offensive potential from a lineup that has been sporadic at best.</p>
        <p>Now that they know they will not be getting Detroit's Juan Gonzalez, they can use Knoblauch at designated hitter and Soriano at second base, rather than using the light-hitting Jose Vizcaino as the replacement in the starting lineup for Knoblauch.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch has committed 14 errors, 10 of those on throws, and Manager Joe Torre started him at designated hitter in two of the three games against the White Sox last weekend in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Soriano struggled at third base and shortstop for the Yankees earlier this season, fumbling balls and rushing throws as he committed 6 errors in 15 games. But playing second base will afford Soriano more time to relax; he can knock balls down and still throw runners out at first.</p>
        <p>No one doubts that Soriano has the potential to be a front-line offensive player in the majors because of his ability to hit line drives and run the bases. He is batting .285 in Class AAA this year, with 5 homers, 21 runs batted in and 7 steals in 46 games.</p>
        <p>Ted Lilly, who had been scheduled to pitch for Columbus last night, was also scratched, perhaps as protection in case the Yankees need a starter later in the week. David Cone, Ben Ford, Ramiro Mendoza and Andy Pettitte are to start the next four games, but Ford has had a cold, Mendoza has complained of shoulder stiffness and the Yankees do not know if Orlando Hernandez can start Saturday. If Hernandez has any problems throwing off a mound in Detroit today, he could be placed on the disabled list and replaced by Lilly.</p>
        <p>Scott Brosius felt tightness in his right hamstring and left Sunday's game, but the Yankees announced yesterday that they expected he would be able to play against Detroit this week and might be able to start tonight. The Yankees have had some discussions with San Diego about a possible deal for infielder Ed Sprague, but they might choose to wait until after the bigger trade talks -- Sammy Sosa -- are completed before they begin filling out their roster.</p>
        <p>The Cubs had at least one scout at the Clippers' game last night -- to watch Soriano, among others.</p>
