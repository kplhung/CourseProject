        <p>This spring, the grievances at 1084-1086 Home Street in the South Bronx piled up like the garbage in the courtyard: sporadic heat and hot water, unpaid light bills, water-cracked walls, rats swaggering through like neighborhood bullies. Hallway graffiti cursed the landlord, who had not bothered to paint over it.</p>
        <p>The building's state was not the handiwork of a profiteering landlord. Rather, the overseer of 1084-1086 Home Street is the Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association, a Bronx nonprofit community development corporation once praised as a national model for residents who want to restore failing housing and reclaim lost neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Today, its own properties are increasingly troubled, whether by periods without heat or by unrealized plans, as with a former synagogue, empty and encrusted with scaffolding, on Fox Street.</p>
        <p>For a group that got its start rehabilitating abandoned buildings, there may be no symbol more dispiriting than 866 Beck Street, a Banana Kelly building that deteriorated so much that it was emptied of tenants and boarded up.</p>
        <p>''Our savior has become a slumlord,'' said Marta Rivera, the chairwoman of the local community board and a tenant at 1084 Home Street since 1987.</p>
        <p>The criticism, if harsh, is understandable, given what Banana Kelly, which drew its memorable name from the curve of the Bronx street where it was born, once meant in the South Bronx.</p>
        <p>Two decades ago, foundations, reporters and government officials flocked to the Hunts Point-Longwood neighborhoods to see how Banana Kelly had transformed drug-infested, derelict tenements into livable spaces, and had created low-income housing co-ops that proved the salvation of a once-devastated area.</p>
        <p>To its critics, the decline of some of Banana Kelly's properties is a physical reflection of the group's internal disarray, which is sketched in remarkably consistent terms by current and former board members, former employees and financial backers.</p>
        <p>Local merchants have shunned, and in some cases sued, the organization because of unpaid debts; at least one oil company began demanding cash on delivery. Former employees who have exited through its revolving door contend that top officials used program money for international travel, an accusation that, according to one federal law enforcement official, is being examined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The group's board, the essential instrument for accountability, has withered to a tiny group that rarely meets.</p>
        <p>Banana Kelly's revenues from foundations, government grants and development projects dropped from nearly $6 million in 1994 to barely $3 million in 1998. It currently has no city financing. Its debts, meanwhile, have mounted into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. It is in arrears on six city mortgages, and behind on payroll taxes. At times, its employees say, their offices lacked for toilet paper. Grand plans, most notably a paper recycling plant proposed for the South Bronx, have stalled or failed.</p>
        <p>Twenty-two years after its formation, Banana Kelly is one of the Bronx's major landlords. It manages 41 buildings that house formerly homeless and low-income and working-class families. Over the years, it has expanded into a multiservice agency employing 95 people who do everything from managing its properties to counseling AIDS patients.</p>
        <p>Its many triumphs have included a 1996 award from the city as an outstanding community-based organization and another at a United Nations conference that year. But its critics say its recent awards reflect an organization coasting on past glories.</p>
        <p>The group's chairwoman, Yolanda Rivera, disputed the critics,  saying that it is a wonderful time for Banana Kelly, and that she was bringing renewed vigor to righting it financially. She cited the high school the organization started in 1997; the Board of Education has authorized the construction of a building for the school.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rivera denies any allegation that money was misused. She said many of the property problems were caused by tenants who had never learned how to live independently, and said politics or mischief motivated many of her critics. She said that the city had been little help in alleviating the organization's debts, and that she deserved credit for keeping Banana Kelly afloat in a trying period. ''I'm not ashamed that we continue to operate, that we are healthy,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Her defenders say that she is paying the price for being a successful Hispanic woman. Joe Hall, who worked at Banana Kelly for eight years, said Ms. Rivera embodies ''the great paradox of community development in New York'': foundations and other institutions say they want to cultivate indigenous leaders like Ms. Rivera, but then are threatened when they succeed.</p>
        <p>But for many, Banana Kelly's situation is less paradox than parable, illustrating some of the dangers inherent in the recent history of government's relationship with poor neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>During the last few decades, government has stepped back from direct involvement in areas like housing and health care, and instead encouraged community development organizations like Banana Kelly to step into the breach.</p>
        <p>Neither oversight nor adequate resources have always followed. When nonprofit organizations have struggled, government overseers have often been ill positioned or unwilling to attempt reform. No government agency even has a complete sense of Banana Kelly's finances.</p>
        <p>In part, Banana Kelly's very purpose has protected it. ''Not-for-profits in these communities on the housing side are so critical a resource,'' said Jerilyn Perine, the first deputy commissioner at the city's Department of Housing, Preservation and Development. ''We want to see them succeed. We don't want them to fail. Their importance goes simply beyond their own organization. It's not as if if they disappeared, someone will take their place.''</p>
        <p>Out of the Ruins  A Radical Idea: Save Buildings</p>
        <p>Banana Kelly bloomed from the ruins, at a time when housing in the South Bronx was being burned, not built. In the 1970's, a group of residents on Kelly Street united to stop the demolition of three buildings on their block.</p>
        <p>The group revamped those buildings and won title to them and others from a city desperate to divest itself of abandoned or deteriorating housing. The city provided loans for rehabilitation or gave Banana Kelly newly renovated buildings to manage, usually asking a symbolic pittance in return.</p>
        <p>In 1978, Banana Kelly incorporated as a nonprofit corporation providing housing and services. Its adopted as its motto, ''Don't Move. Improve.''</p>
        <p>''Everyone was coming in to see how we did this, how did we get people together,'' recalled Pearl White, a founding member, who said she could still remember the splinters stinging her hands as she helped rehabilitate the buildings.</p>
        <p>Banana Kelly brought tens of millions of dollars in investment to its community and rehabilitated more than 2,000 units of housing; it also suggested that the tide of hopelessness could be turned. Its methods, like sweat equity, allowed residents to trade work for ownership, and its performance won it federal, state and city contracts.</p>
        <p>Today, the Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association is an umbrella organization for the limited partnerships and low-income co-ops that own the buildings it manages. It is supposed to collect rents, do maintenance, pay real estate taxes, and make mortgage, water and sewer payments.</p>
        <p>Like many community-based housing developers, it is in a difficult financial position. The group's rents are low, and its tenants vulnerable to falling behind in payments. While Banana Kelly has been taken to Housing Court dozens of times, it has had to bring hundreds of delinquent tenants there, incurring legal expenses each time.</p>
        <p>The city also handed over properties in need of more work than it provided financing for, said Harold DeRienzo, Banana Kelly's founder, and Ms. Rivera.</p>
        <p>Under Ms. Rivera, who became the organization's chief executive in 1991, Banana Kelly undertook various social service operations.</p>
        <p>Saying she wanted to wean both tenants and the organization from dependence on government, Ms. Rivera also turned to large-scale economic development. In 1992, Banana Kelly joined with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national environmental advocacy organization, to develop a paper recycling plant to be built in the South Bronx.</p>
        <p>The plant was designed by Maya Lin, best known for the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, and praised by President Clinton.</p>
        <p>But it has yet to be built; financing and politics have postponed it indefinitely. Like a castle in the air, it drained personnel and attention from an organization struggling on the ground.</p>
        <p>Staff Turnover  A Poor Record Of Management</p>
        <p>As Banana Kelly grew, its infrastructure was being stretched. When Ms. Rivera took over, she dismissed a number of staff members, saying an excess of professionals had distanced the agency from the community.</p>
        <p>In subsequent years, new employees and executives have come, but few have stayed long. Many have been fired in the agency's many purges during the last eight years. Even today, Ms. Rivera said, most of the staff is brand-new.</p>
        <p>But the agency eventually became overwhelmed, current and former officials said. Financial backers of Banana Kelly describe almost willfully incompetent financial management. They say Banana Kelly never found a workable system for collecting and tracking rents and expenditures, and did a poor job of separating its various operations. It missed tax advantages, and a $2 million state grant awarded in 1998 to renovate 866 Beck Street and another building is being withheld pending an updated audited financial statement, state officials said.</p>
        <p>There is also the nearly $1 million owed for water and sewer services, more than $500,000 in real estate taxes, the overdue $127,000 an oil company is trying to collect, the liens and lawsuits over the years from accountants, hardware stores and others.</p>
        <p>Former employees describe continual pressures to use money earmarked for specific programs to offset those debts, and say programs and maintenance operations had to run on shoestrings. Superintendents reached into their own pockets to buy everything from paint to oil; the group's former president said he had to take out a loan to make the payroll.</p>
        <p>But as employees were scrounging, Ms. Rivera and a few associates were traveling, as part of an international venture the group established several years ago.</p>
        <p>By Ms. Rivera's own admission, some part of the organization's dwindling resources -- what she calls general, or unrestricted funds -- were used to pay for that travel, including a trip to a conference in Kenya for her and several associates.</p>
        <p>''We got a good group rate,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But, as part of an investigation into Banana Kelly's finances, the F.B.I. is looking at whether federal program money was used to pay for that trip and whether Ms. Rivera's relatives went with her, a federal law enforcement official said.</p>
        <p>Among those on the Africa trip was a Bronx-based consultant who did particularly well under Banana Kelly's auspices. By the time the consultant, Aureo Cardona, left the organization last year, his company, Crescendo Inc., was being paid $15,000 a month to manage Banana Kelly's properties, and he had been given access to a $50,000 expense fund -- to be replenished as needed -- to do ''national and international engagements'' for the group. And, under a contract he signed with Claude Gooding, the organization's former president, he was to receive $1 million if the recycling plant went to financial closing, which it has not.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rivera says she knew nothing about that contract, and the two parted ways after The New York Post reported the deal last year. Mr. Cardona is now suing Banana Kelly for back pay, saying his contract was breached, and would not discuss his history with the group.</p>
        <p>Another frequent traveler was Mr. Hall, who was named president of Banana Kelly International. Mr. Hall, who said his salary was $55,000, lived in a Banana Kelly apartment at 814 Manida Street, which is supposed to house low-income tenants exclusively under the group's agreement with the city.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall said he did not know the building was for low-income tenants; Ms. Rivera said she thought it was for low-to-moderate-income tenants.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rivera has been at the center of controversy almost since she took charge of the organization in 1991, after having been chairwoman of its board since 1985. She has retained her board chairmanship during her tenure as chief executive, an arrangement that her predecessor, Getz Obstfeld, called ''fairly uncommon,'' and that her critics assert insulates her from accountability.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the board has shrunk, with as few as three members, including Ms. Rivera, usually attending no more than one meeting a year. Banana Kelly's bylaws say that ''board members are not to be directly involved with management.'' Yet over the years, in addition to Ms. Rivera, various board members have been employed by Banana Kelly, including Rosemonde Pierre-Louis, a member since 1996, who became the organization's president last fall.</p>
        <p>If Ms. Rivera has rewarded the loyal, her critics say, she has been vindictive toward those she sees as disloyal. In February, she fired five building superintendents without notice and has since tried to evict them, although the firings  await union arbitration.</p>
        <p>''She is the law in Banana Kelly,'' a fired superintendent, Agripino Morales, said.</p>
        <p>Tenants Make Do  Buildings Worsen, Repairs Go Undone</p>
        <p>But neither deep resentment nor financial travails seem to have affected Banana Kelly, its critics say. As its city financing has dwindled to nothing, it has simply turned to the state and federal governments.</p>
        <p>City officials could foreclose on Banana Kelly's mortgages, but feel that doing so would set the community back 20 years. Despite being aware of Banana Kelly's management problems for years, in April 1999 the housing department turned four more buildings over to the group. So tenants make do with the landlord they have.</p>
        <p>In Lydia Rios's apartment at 788 Fox Street, a city housing inspector who visited in April left a checklist of violations, from no smoke detector to a leaky ceiling. She shrugged. Each year the housing inspector orders repairs, and they go undone, she said.</p>
        <p>Banana Kelly's financial backers and city officials say they have lately become particularly concerned because of deferred maintenance to Banana Kelly's properties.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rivera said the organization is seeking a loan to pay off back taxes and to rehabilitate 788 Fox Street and several other buildings. But, she said of tenants, ''If conditions were as bad as they sometimes say, they would have moved out.''</p>
        <p>Given the organization's roots, that sentiment sits poorly with Pearl White, who has sat on Banana Kelly's board since its inception. She said she has futilely challenged Ms. Rivera's actions and demanded more records. She was warned, she said, that if she spoke publicly about her concerns, she would be removed from the board.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to see any of the buildings end up like the condition we were in,'' she said, sitting in the apartment on Kelly Street she helped bring back to life with her bare hands more than two decades ago. ''I don't want to see Banana Kelly ruined.''</p>
