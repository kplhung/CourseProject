        <p>''Need Elephant Repellent? Try This Hot Pepper Brew'' (June 20), about Dr. Ferrel Loki Osborn's ''elephant repellent,'' brings to mind an experience I had in my last semester at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, living in an old house on a large lot that was overgrown with weeds. In the spring we became infested with a rat population but were able to get rid of most of them by using a common rat repellent.</p>

        <p>''Need Elephant Repellent? Try This Hot Pepper Brew'' (June 20), about Dr. Ferrel Loki Osborn's ''elephant repellent,'' brings to mind an experience I had in my last semester at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, living in an old house on a large lot that was overgrown with weeds. In the spring we became infested with a rat population but were able to get rid of most of them by using a common rat repellent.</p>
        <p>There was one very hardy and persistent rat, however, that was not only surviving but even trying to gnaw through a small hole in the kitchen floor. We tried everything but nothing seemed to work. One evening, as the rat was gnawing away, I poured a whole large jar of Tabasco through the hole. I apparently made direct contact with the rat's mouth and that was the end of that.</p>
