        <p>I've known since childhood that I was susceptible to motion sickness. I never could read in the back seat of a car, and in my early 20's I got queasy as a passenger riding down a winding mountain road (though I was fine if I drove). But I hadn't experienced the full-blown syndrome until I took my sons on a fishing boat in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
        <p>We left at noon and I hadn't had time for lunch. As the boat rocked over the waves, I tried fishing from the side. As if that were not enough to flip my insides out, I had to go below deck to use the facilities. Upon returning to my rod, I fed the fish the remains of my breakfast. I spent the rest of the expedition lying flat on the top deck.</p>

        <p>I've known since childhood that I was susceptible to motion sickness. I never could read in the back seat of a car, and in my early 20's I got queasy as a passenger riding down a winding mountain road (though I was fine if I drove). But I hadn't experienced the full-blown syndrome until I took my sons on a fishing boat in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
        <p>We left at noon and I hadn't had time for lunch. As the boat rocked over the waves, I tried fishing from the side. As if that were not enough to flip my insides out, I had to go below deck to use the facilities. Upon returning to my rod, I fed the fish the remains of my breakfast. I spent the rest of the expedition lying flat on the top deck.</p>
        <p>It is small compensation to anyone feeling motion sick to know they are hardly alone. Up to 90 percent of the population is susceptible, given adequate stimulus. Lawrence of Arabia got sick bouncing about on his camel, and Charles Darwin's discovery of natural selection is said to have resulted in part because he was so seasick he had to get off the boat onto those islands. I've encountered any number of people who refuse to travel anywhere by boat because they once became seasick and can't bear the thought that it may happen again.</p>
        <p>Motion sickness is the result of a conflict between messages delivered to the brain, with one signal coming from the inner ear that controls balance and a disparate signal coming from the eyes and pressure receptors of the skin and joints. The conflicting messages are delivered to the nausea center of the brain. This is why reading in a moving vehicle is such a common precipitant of motion sickness; eyes are focused on a page while the body is being bounced and turned on the road.</p>
        <p>Though infants are spared, children between the ages of 2 and 12 are often susceptible, but tend to do better as they get older. Dogs, too, are often affected, especially as puppies. Even fish can get seasick. Adults over 50 are least likely to become motion sick. I love traveling with a 61-year-old friend who can read guide books and road maps while I drive.</p>
        <p>Genetics plays a role in susceptibility. In a study of various ethnic groups by Dr. Robert Stern and Dr. Kenneth Koch at Pennsylvania State University's Hershey Medical Center, Asian-American children topped the charts; 100 percent of them became nauseated when a rotating drum created the illusion of motion, and many requested an early end to the study.</p>
        <p>Riding in Comfort</p>
        <p>Genetics notwithstanding, there are any number of nonmedical measures you can take to reduce your susceptibility to motion sickness. First and foremost, take a tip from pregnant women with morning sickness and eat something before traveling. A light, starchy meal beforehand with periodic snacks on route of something like bread or crackers is best for sustaining a normal blood sugar. Starting the night before travel, avoid eating a heavy meal or one high in fat and refrain from carbonated beverages, alcohol and spicy foods. While traveling, avoid tobacco smoke and pungent food smells.</p>
        <p>Locate yourself where there is the least motion. If at all possible, ride in the front seat of the car and look straight ahead. Or, better yet, drive yourself. The message entering through your eyes and pressure receptors will better match the one from the inner ear.</p>
        <p>On a plane, select a window seat over the wing. On a ship, select a cabin in the center of the boat but spend as much time as possible in a well-ventilated area. Sit on the deck facing forward and watch the horizon. Try to avoid going below deck, where everything looks static.</p>
        <p>If all else fails, lie down and close your eyes. Whatever you do, avoid watching the waves or fast-moving scenery.</p>
        <p>While some of us can read with comfort in a moving vehicle (for example, I can usually read without problems while riding in the front seat on a smooth, straight highway without stop-and-go traffic), those most prone to motion sickness should refrain from reading. Listen to music, look straight ahead or sleep when you're not driving.</p>
        <p>Inventive Preventives</p>
        <p>Both ancient and modern medicine can offer effective assistance if the above measures are not enough to forestall motion sickness. Ginger, long recognized as a gastrointestinal calmative, has been shown in controlled studies to be very helpful, even for carsick dogs and children. It has helped my dog, a neighbor's dog and my sons and I found it helpful on rocky seas in the Galapagos, both on the boat and while snorkling.</p>
        <p>Ginger should be taken as a capsule or coated tablet to avoid esophageal irritation. Various over-the-counter versions of ginger capsules are sold in health food stores and pharmacies. One tablet product, Queeze-Eze (the manufacturer is in DeBary, Fla., 904-774-5277), contains several nutrients and fruit enzymes that are said to prevent irritation and enhance quick action. The only reported side effect of ginger is an occasional ginger-flavored burp.</p>
        <p>Another modern version of an ancient remedy takes advantage of the Nei-kuan acupressure point on the wrist. It lies between the two tendons on the underside of the wrist two finger widths past the main crease where the hand meets the arm. Stimulating this point can prevent morning sickness as well as motion sickness, and this remedy has absolutely no side effects and is safe for everyone.</p>
        <p>I first encountered the acupressure technique on a trip to the Antarctic. As we crossed the infamous Drake Passage, the whole ship was flattened except for one woman who sat on the deck reading. She was wearing Sea-Bands, one on each wrist. They resemble elasticized bracelets with a plastic button in the inner side that is aligned to press against the Nei-kuan acupressure point.</p>
        <p>Sea-Bands and several imitators are sold in pharmacies, health food stores and travel shops. A pair costs $10 to $15. Another product, called Acu-Band, has an adjustable wrist strap. It is sold by Traveler's Checklist in Sharon, Conn., for $12.95 plus $2 for shipping, (860) 364-0144.</p>
        <p>Much more expensive though possibly more effective is an electronic version called ReliefBand, available from the Woodside Biomedical order department in South Bend, Ind., (800) 973-0378. By means of a three-volt lithium battery, it transmits an electrical signal through the skin to the nerve underlying the Nei-kuan point.</p>
        <p>In studies it has been 90 percent effective in preventing nausea and vomiting from many causes, including chemotherapy. It is safe for everyone except those with cardiac pacemakers. Three nonprescription versions are available, a 48-hour disposable ($49.95), a 144-hour disposable ($95.95) and a reusable ($164.50), plus shipping and handling.</p>
        <p>In the drug department, there are over-the-counter antihistamines, including Dramamine, Bonine and Marezine. Among the choices, Dramamine is most likely to cause drowsiness.</p>
        <p>The most potent of remedies, Transderm Scop, is available only by prescription. After a four-year hiatus to enhance effectiveness, this patch containing scopalamine is back on the market. One patch placed behind the ear is effective for three days.</p>
        <p>The most common side effect is dry mouth. Other possible adverse effects include drowsiness, temporary blurring of vision and, infrequently, disorientation, memory loss, restlessness, dizziness and hallucinations.</p>
        <p>It should not be used by anyone who drinks alcohol, women who are pregnant or nursing or those with glaucoma. Consult your doctor if you have a metabolic, liver or kidney disease or trouble urinating.</p>
