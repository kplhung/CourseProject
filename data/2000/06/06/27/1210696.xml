        <p>IT WAS last December, and Robert A. Wyatt, a managing partner in the creative department of the New York office of Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising was walking through Grand Central Terminal obsessing -- as he had for months -- on his latest project: how to persuade the world that Xerox, a name synonymous with pricey corporate copiers, also stood for low-priced home printers.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, from the window of Posman Books, an image leaped out at him: A blue dog with bright yellow eyes. ''It just stopped me cold,'' Mr. Wyatt recalled. ''It said art, color, imagination, all those things you'd want to associate with printers.''</p>

        <p>IT WAS last December, and Robert A. Wyatt, a managing partner in the creative department of the New York office of Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising was walking through Grand Central Terminal obsessing -- as he had for months -- on his latest project: how to persuade the world that Xerox, a name synonymous with pricey corporate copiers, also stood for low-priced home printers.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, from the window of Posman Books, an image leaped out at him: A blue dog with bright yellow eyes. ''It just stopped me cold,'' Mr. Wyatt recalled. ''It said art, color, imagination, all those things you'd want to associate with printers.''</p>
        <p>It was, of course, the cover of ''Blue Dog Man,'' the painter George Rodrigue's latest compilation of paintings featuring the Blue Dog, an image of almost cultlike popularity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wyatt bought the book and rushed to the office to show it to Barry Hoffman, his partner on the Xerox project. Several conversations and plane trips to Mr. Rodrigue's New Orleans home later and a campaign was born.</p>
        <p>For an amount he will not divulge -- although he did sound pleased in a recent telephone conversation -- Mr. Rodrigue will paint a series of Blue Dog ads for Xerox over the next five years. He gets veto power over story boards. And, he gets to keep the paintings.</p>
        <p>Still, a serious artist selling printers? ''I make images and they make images, so why not put them together?'' Mr. Rodrigue said. ''Would Andy Warhol have done this? Yes.''</p>
        <p>The campaign, which Xerox will unveil along with four new inkjet printers today at PC Expo in New York, features Mr. Rodrigue's Blue Dog riding a motorcycle (''twice as fast as the rest of the pack''), standing guard by the printer (''always faithful to its owner''), and doing other vaguely printer-related tasks.</p>
        <p>Each ad carries the slogan ''a smarter breed of inkjet printer'' -- interesting wordplay in that Blue Dog is, to put it most kindly, of indeterminate ancestry.</p>
        <p>The ads represent many firsts for Xerox. They trumpet the $149 price of Xerox's lowest-cost printer, a shocker for a company whose advertising has always played down the importance of price. Blue Dog's almost cartoonlike simplicity appeals not just to adults but to children, a group that uses home printers a lot, but that Xerox has never pursued.</p>
        <p>The ads include the Xerox logo -- ''Xerox, the Document Company,'' in muted tones -- but also feature a new logo styled just for the printer line in red, green, orange and blue. They show the logos of Staples and other stores that will sell Xerox printers.</p>
        <p>And, with a budget of more than $200 million, the campaign is the most expensive in Xerox history.</p>
        <p>The stakes may justify the cost. Xerox reckons that SOHO -- that's industry parlance for small office and home office -- represents a $57 billion market for printers. Canon, I.B.M. and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen are making huge inroads into Xerox's corporate markets, so the company badly needs SOHO sales to grow. And, with Hewlett-Packard already the 800-pound gorilla in the printer market, Xerox needs to grab those sales before ''to Hewlett'' becomes as generic a term for printing as ''to Xerox'' has been for copying.</p>
        <p>Xerox recently signed a distributor's agreement with Dell Computer, and analysts say it will soon announce -- probably today -- a deal with Compaq to bundle Xerox printers in with Compaq's personal computers. But Xerox knows it needs even more to bolster sales.</p>
        <p>''We need bold advertising, because you can't send a lot of salesmen to call on small businesses,'' said James A. Firestone, Xerox's senior vice president for marketing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wyatt and Mr. Hoffman faced no easy task, though. For decades, Xerox billed itself as the megacorporation's document utopia. The result? ''Xerox is a household name without a household product, a name that says big price tags on big copiers for big companies,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''Xerox's competitors could differentiate themselves from each other, but we had to differentiate Xerox from itself.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodrigue has already painted five Blue Dog ads, at least three of which will also be used on billboards. Other Blue Dogs may turn up on packaging for printers and paper. There are no plans to animate Blue Dog, but its image will be ubiquitous in the commercials that Xerox will show during the Summer Olympics, which begin in September.</p>
        <p>Xerox will also run banner ads featuring Blue Dog on the Web sites  of e-tailers like Amazon.com and  Outpost.com, as well as on portals like Yahoo. It is providing brick-and-mortar retailers with advertising kits that feature Blue Dog. And starting today, Xerox's Web page -- www.xerox.com -- will offer links to more information on Blue Dog and on inkjet printers.</p>
        <p>The campaign will roll out nationally in August, in time for the back-to-school season, traditionally a big selling time for printers.</p>
        <p>The timing is equally fortunate for Mr. Rodrigue, who has painted the Blue Dog since 1984. Despite a persistent myth that the Blue Dog is Mr. Rodrigue's homage to a beloved dog who died, it started out as his vision of the Loup Garou, a weredog (as in werewolf) from Cajun folklore. Over the years, the dog evolved into a friendlier more colorful image.</p>
        <p>Until now, Mr. Rodrigue's only foray into advertising was to participate in the familiar artists' campaign for Absolut vodka, for which the company commissions artists to paint whatever the brand brings to mind. Mr. Rodrigue recalled painting Blue Dog with flowers.</p>
        <p>''I've turned down Blue Dog movies, Blue Dog TV shows, toys and T-shirts, even a request from Steven Spielberg's people to use the image,'' Mr. Rodrigue said. ''Everyone says, 'You can make a lot of money.' Well, I already make a lot of money.''</p>
        <p>He also has books and two art galleries. So Mr. Rodrigue is at PC Expo this week, painting Blue Dogs in public view, in effect serving as a human advertisement for his Xerox advertisements.</p>
        <p>''This campaign will expose the Blue Dog to a lot more people,'' he said, ''and that should make the paintings even more valuable.''</p>
