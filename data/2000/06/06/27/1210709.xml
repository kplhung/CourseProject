        <p>Hoping to create a strong new force in the market for office telephone systems and networking equipment, Lucent Technologies Inc. intends to announce a new brand today for its unit that sells communications products to business customers, people close to the division said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The unit, which Lucent calls its Enterprise Networks division, is in the process of being spun out of Lucent as an independent company. Lucent plans no initial public offering of stock in the new company, which has about $8 billion in annual revenue. Instead, Lucent intends to distribute all the shares in the new company directly to its own shareholders by the end of September.</p>

        <p>Hoping to create a strong new force in the market for office telephone systems and networking equipment, Lucent Technologies Inc. intends to announce a new brand today for its unit that sells communications products to business customers, people close to the division said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The unit, which Lucent calls its Enterprise Networks division, is in the process of being spun out of Lucent as an independent company. Lucent plans no initial public offering of stock in the new company, which has about $8 billion in annual revenue. Instead, Lucent intends to distribute all the shares in the new company directly to its own shareholders by the end of September.</p>
        <p>It was unclear yesterday just what the new company would be called. A Lucent spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
        <p>But no matter the name of the new brand, today's announcement will not answer the main question that many of Lucent's investors are asking these days: Does the company plan to spin off its fast-growing microelectronics unit?</p>
        <p>Lucent's top management has at least considered such a move, but it does not appear that a final decision has been made. Any announcement of such a move probably would not be made for at least two weeks, according to one person close to the operation.</p>
        <p>Analysts estimate that the microelectronics division, which makes chips and other components used in advanced communications equipment, has annual revenue of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. Nonetheless, because it is growing quickly and because investors are currently infatuated with comparable companies like JDS Uniphase and Broadcom, the microelectronics division could enjoy a stand-alone market value of $50 billion or more.</p>
        <p>Lucent does not report financial results for its microelectronics business per se, but the larger business unit to which the microelectronics section belongs reported revenue growth in the most recent quarter of 38 percent, to $1.7 billion, over the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Even though the Enterprise Networks group has twice the revenue of the microelectronics operation, it is likely to have a much smaller market value. That is because the Enterprise Networks group is actually shrinking, at least in its current form. For the most recent quarter, Lucent announced that the division generated $2 billion in revenue, which was down 8 percent from the 1999 period.</p>
        <p>At least in part, Lucent wants to spin out the Enterprise group, which includes among its products office phone systems and office communications cables, because it is dragging down the growth rate for the overall company.</p>
