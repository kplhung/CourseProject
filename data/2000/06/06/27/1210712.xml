        <p>Over the next three months, the chairman of Vivendi S.A., Jean-Marie Messier, plans to dash between Paris, New York and London, ebulliently selling the concept of a wireless Internet world where Vivendi's acquisition of the Seagram Company will reap a windfall.</p>
        <p>It could be a hard sell.</p>
        <p>Since the announcement of Vivendi's $41 billion deal to acquire Seagram last week, analysts have been squinting to see the synergies between Mr. Messier's company -- which owns environmental, waste and communications businesses -- and Seagram, which owns a major record company, film studio, theme park business and liquor operation.</p>
        <p>In an interview on Sunday evening Mr. Messier, Vivendi's 43-year-old chairman and chief executive, said Seagram's Universal entertainment businesses would help draw subscribers to Vizzavi -- Vivendi's venture with the British telecommunications carrier Vodaphone P.L.C. to offer Internet access through mobile phones, computers and interactive television.</p>
        <p>In turn, he said, Vizzavi could promote Universal: enabling subscribers to download new Universal music albums, for example.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Messier follows a long list of media executives who have embraced the concept of vertical integration: mergers that marry programming and distribution. And those deals, most notably the Walt Disney Company's 1996 purchase of Capital Cities/ABC, have often proved troublesome.</p>
        <p>Certainly the stock performances of both Seagram and Vivendi since the deal was announced last week indicate that investors on both sides of the Atlantic remain skeptical. Since word of the merger emerged, Seagram shares have risen 17.7 percent, closing at $59.5625 yesterday. That still leaves a wide gap between the trading price and Vivendi's offer of $70.44 a share for Seagram. Vivendi's shares, meanwhile, are down 20 percent, closing at $88.05 yesterday in Paris.</p>
        <p>Three analysts said separately yesterday that they could not see why Vivendi needed to buy Seagram  -- particularly when Vivendi would be paying 18 times cash flow for the entertainment operations -- with no apparent cost savings to be realized.</p>
        <p>Mr. Messier said he was most enamored of the music division, which has Polygram as its cornerstone. Seagram paid roughly 13 times cash flow for Polygram just two years ago and did realize cost savings by combining operations with the other Universal Music labels. If music is so important, why didn't Vivendi buy Polygram when it was on the market before, at a lower price? ''It was a bit early,'' Mr. Messier said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Messier now sees a new opportunity because the distribution technology will be the Internet, and through the Vizzavi venture, his company could establish an early stronghold in Europe, where wireless Internet access is growing much faster than in the United States.</p>
        <p>But because Universal Music will have every incentive to make its albums available to Vizzavi's competitors, too, analysts are wondering  why Vivendi could not get access to the music without taking on the financial costs of the deal.</p>
        <p>As for Universal's film business, Mr. Messier was quick to say that the French did not intend to run Universal's rebounding movie business, and he praised Stacy Snider, chairwoman of Universal Pictures. But he failed to mention Ron Meyer, president of Universal Studios, which oversees Ms. Snider's operation. Only after being asked, did Mr. Messier say that Mr. Meyer's future was up to him, seeming to imply that Mr. Meyer was dispensible.</p>
        <p>Industry executives say that if the French ultimately want to dismiss Mr. Meyer, who is 5 years through a 10-year contract, it could cost Vivendi as much as $100 million. Mr. Meyer declined to comment.</p>
        <p>A number of media takeovers have been characterized by costly management turnover, which not only destablizes companies, but can make it tougher for studio owners to set compensation packages for the new team. For now, Mr. Meyer remains in place. He plans to fly to Paris this week to meet with management at Canal Plus, the French pay television company that is about to become part of Vivendi.</p>
