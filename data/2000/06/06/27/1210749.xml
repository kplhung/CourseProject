        <p>Ever since the Giuliani administration's sweeping new welfare rules took effect five years ago, the steep reduction in the city's welfare rolls has been accompanied by a string of unanswered questions: How many former recipients are working at decent-paying jobs? How many of those no longer on the rolls were simply committing fraud? And how many of them were needy families wrongly removed because of bureaucratic error?</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the considerable hand-wringing over these issues, the answers to those questions remain elusive.</p>
        <p>But now, in one densely populated poor corner of the city, a coalition of 35 social service groups has found -- accidentally, they say -- that the benefits for a startling number of families have been wrongfully canceled or reduced, and that nearly all of them have had them restored after advocates intervened.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, joined on the steps of City Hall by politicians and advocates, officials with the Washington Heights/Inwood Neighborhood Advisory Council, which conducted the seven-month study, said their findings highlighted what they called the Giuliani administration's ''cruel and deliberate strategy'' to reduce the welfare rolls.</p>
        <p>The sharp declines in the number of people receiving public assistance had been achieved, they contended, by simply throwing people off the rolls -- sometimes called ''churning'' -- and not because they had become self-sufficient.</p>
        <p>''They're being cut from the rolls rather than being helped by jobs,'' said Julie Levine, executive director of the Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation, the nonprofit group that was the primary agency making the study.</p>
        <p>Financed by the United Way and focused on the Dyckman job center, the city welfare office serving Washington Heights and Inwood, the study found that of the 174 families who reported having problems with their welfare benefits, 93 percent either were wrongly denied benefits when they applied or lost their benefits wrongly. As a result, most lost their housing subsidies and were threatened with eviction.</p>
        <p>In all but 2 of the 174 cases, benefits were restored, sometimes as a result of a city hearing to challenge the disposition of their case. But the corrections were made with considerable effort.</p>
        <p>On average, the study found, it took 70 days to resolve a challenge.  The city was often tardy in complying with the results of such sessions, known as fair hearings. The law says the findings must be implemented within 90 days.</p>
        <p>The Dyckman center, one of 17 city welfare offices, had a dearth of Spanish speakers in an office that serves an overwhelmingly Spanish-speaking immigrant clientele. It was cited last fall by federal civil rights officials for failing to provide foreign language interpreters, and the city is drafting a corrective plan.</p>
        <p>In a statement released yesterday evening, the Human Resources Administration spokeswoman, Ruth Reinecke, described the groups' report as ''a political document.''</p>
        <p>''Compiled at the behest of the usual suspects who oppose welfare reform and favor dependency,'' she added in the statement, ''this report presupposes its incorrect conclusions.''</p>
        <p>She would not say anything further about the Dyckman job center, or the report's findings.</p>
        <p>Whether this snapshot of one welfare office reflects what is happening citywide remains unclear, though anecdotal evidence from advocates and politicians from other parts of the city echoes these findings.</p>
        <p>The city has cut its welfare rolls by half since 1995; in May 2000, the most recent date for which figures are available, 576,723 people remained, Ms. Reinecke said.</p>
        <p>The Washington Heights/Inwood inquiry confirmed what neighborhood social service advocates said they had long suspected: that many families were losing benefits improperly and that as a result, children, who make up two-thirds of all welfare recipients, were suffering.</p>
        <p>''The findings of this report were no surprise to us,'' said Moises Perez, executive director of Alianza Dominicana, which represents people in fair hearings, usually successfully. ''Mistakes that were made were so blatant.''</p>
        <p>The study, Ms. Levine said, was not intended to gauge the effects of the city's welfare policies, but to quantify the variety of social service needs in the neighborhood. A hot line was established. Social work students were hired to take calls, refer the callers to appropriate services and intervene on their behalf, when necessary, with the appropriate government agencies.</p>
