        <p>There are two big winners in the two-part deal to sell off Nabisco: Philip Morris shareholders, who saw the price of their stock rise nearly $4 yesterday on the news that the maker of Marlboro, Jell-O and Miracle Whip would now own brands like Oreo and Wheat Thins; and Carl C. Icahn, the value investor whose betting against the market when he bought a stake in Nabisco Group Holdings earlier this year gave him a very large psychic and financial victory.</p>
        <p>''When we bought Nabisco three or four months ago, everybody said it was in big trouble because of the litigation,'' Mr. Icahn recalled in an interview from his home in East Hampton, N.Y., where he had spent the better part of last week as the final installments in the closely watched takeover drama unfolded. ''Nabisco was just amazingly undervalued.''</p>
        <p>His investment grew to $980 million by the time the deal was done, netting him and his investors about $600 million, after a very brief period.</p>
        <p>Nabisco Holdings, which makes nuts and condiments as well as cookies and crackers, will be sold to Philip Morris for $14.9 billion, or $55 a share. Once that deal is complete, R. J. Reynolds will buy Nabisco Group Holdings, whose only asset is 80.6 percent of Nabisco Holdings, for $30 a share, or about $9.8 billion. The holding company will retain $1.5 billion in cash, ''until we decide what we want to do with it,'' a spokeswoman said.</p>
        <p>At a news conference yesterday, Geoffrey C. Bible, the chairman and chief executive of Philip Morris, said he would not spin off all of Kraft, which will be a giant among food makers once the acquisition of Nabisco is complete. The company does plan to spin off 10 percent to 15 percent of Kraft early next year, which Mr. Bible said could generate $5 billion to $10 billion.</p>
        <p>Shares in all four companies involved in the deal went up yesterday. ''This transaction has unlocked some value that had been hidden by the taint of tobacco smoke,'' said John M. McMillin, a food stocks analyst for Prudential Securities.</p>
        <p>There were reports yesterday that Group Danone, the French food maker, had submitted a last-minute bid that came close to the Philip Morris offer. But to break up the deal would cost Danone a fee that Philip Morris executives estimated at $450 million.</p>
        <p>Apart from the fiscal windfall, the deal is a vindication for Mr. Icahn, who led a short-lived proxy battle last spring aimed at getting Steven F. Goldstone, the chairman of what was then known as RJR Nabisco, to spin off the company's majority stake in Nabisco Holdings.</p>
        <p>At that point, Mr. Goldstone had already announced plans to spin off the domestic tobacco business and sell the international rights to brands like Winston and Camel. Mr. Icahn argued that the food holdings should be freed up instead, leaving the domestic tobacco company inside the holding company as a hedge against costs from lawsuits brought by cigarette smokers. In a roundabout way, the deal announced Sunday, in which R. J. Reynolds will pay $30 a share for Nabisco Group Holdings, achieves just that.</p>
        <p>Far from breaking out the Champagne, Mr. Icahn said he was more or less taking the sale of Nabisco in stride. ''It's a great way to lose,'' he said. ''I think Goldstone did a good job in getting a good price for Nabisco.''</p>
        <p>On Friday, he sent a letter to Mr. Goldstone, the chairman of Nabisco, offering to increase his bid to $31 a share in cash and short-term notes; Mr. Icahn said he believed that  prompted R. J. Reynolds to improve its own offer.</p>
        <p>''I increased the bid, and while I didn't win, I'm sure it got the price higher for Nabisco Group Holdings,'' he said. ''I'm sure glad I didn't go to Spain.''</p>
        <p>Instead of heading across the Atlantic, where he was supposed to attend a wedding, he stayed in the New York area while investment bankers and lawyers hammered out the details of the sale of Nabisco Group Holdings, which is contingent on the sale of Nabisco Holdings going through. Both sales are supposed to be completed by October; while pending tobacco litigation could stall the Nabisco Group Holdings deal, many analysts do not expect that to happen.</p>
        <p>''R. J. Reynolds is a richer parent as a result of its deal, which should please plaintiffs,'' said Martin Feldman, a tobacco stocks analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>John Coale, a Washington lawyer who represents some of the plaintiffs in smoking-related lawsuits, said the improved strength of the tobacco companies ''just means the payments to the plaintiffs are more solid.''</p>
        <p>Some have wondered whether Mr. Icahn, who worked tirelessly to break up the food-tobacco combination at RJR Nabisco, would turn his attention next to Philip Morris. Mr. Icahn, who is fond of poker, said that was not in the cards.</p>
        <p>''Too huge,'' he said, referring to the size of Philip Morris. ''I like to be in something where you can have some meaningful input.''</p>
        <p>Among his other investments are a small stake in J. C. Penney, the struggling retailer; a stake of 4.5 million shares in the Federal-Mogul Corporation, an auto-parts maker; and stakes in casino operators like Claridge's and the Sands.</p>
        <p>But he is also keeping a close eye on certain Internet stocks, where he has invested money betting that the share price will fall. ''I'm short a lot of the Internets, such as Amazon and Priceline.com, and have been for the last six months,'' he said. ''I believe some of their business models are completely flawed.''</p>
        <p>He owns a Web-based travel agency, Lowestfare.com, which sells discounted airline tickets and tour packages, which he said was making money. He called the Internet ''a great thing,'' but because of the business model of many Internet companies, he said he was shorting the stocks.</p>
        <p>''You have to have the mental makeup to short them,'' he said. ''When the elevator operator is buying them, that's when you short them. You have to have belief in what you believe. It's like the Rudyard Kipling poem -- if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you -- that's what investing is all about.''</p>
        <p>As for the future, he said: ''I think there will be opportunities in six months to a year. A number of them will have major troubles, and there will be real value.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn provided an auditors' report prepared by Peat Marwick that said his investments had produced an annualized 48 percent return between 1990 and 1995. Since then, an associate said, the rate had continued along the same lines.</p>
        <p>Despite that, there have been some notable failures, including his 1990 junk-bond takeover of Trans World Airlines, which eventually went into bankruptcy, and more recently, his protracted battle with Ronald O. Perelman for control of Marvel Comics.</p>
        <p>He is concerned, he said, about the overvalued state of many stocks. Too many analysts look at cash flow as a guide, he said, when the true earnings of many companies are overstated.</p>
        <p>Then there is the proliferation of online trading, done by people he characterized as overconfident: ''People say they bet on themselves. But it's like playing at a professional poker game. You can win for a little while, but beware.''</p>
