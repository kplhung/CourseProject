        <p>Eight likable performers and video that spun and sidled through New York scenes were the chief ingredients in ''New York, N.Y.,'' a new work choreographed, filmed and directed by Felice Lesser and presented by her troupe on Saturday at the Joyce SoHo. One crucial ingredient was missing: imagination.</p>
        <p>''New York, N.Y.'' tells the story of Stephanie Lyon, a young woman who comes to New York for a career in dance and ends up on the streets after countless failed auditions and a miserable love affair. Ms. Lesser spares no cliche to tell her tale. She does suggest how overwhelming and lonely New York can be to new arrivals. But nothing in her eveninglong piece, a series of brief vignettes set to a wide variety of music, matches the unforgettably individual faces of elderly men and women she videotaped at a center just west of the Port Authority Bus Terminal.</p>

        <p>Eight likable performers and video that spun and sidled through New York scenes were the chief ingredients in ''New York, N.Y.,'' a new work choreographed, filmed and directed by Felice Lesser and presented by her troupe on Saturday at the Joyce SoHo.

        <p>''New York, N.Y.'' tells the story of Stephanie Lyon, a young woman who comes to New York for a career in dance and ends up on the streets after countless failed auditions and a miserable love affair. Ms. Lesser spares no cliche to tell her tale. She does suggest how overwhelming and lonely New York can be to new arrivals. But nothing in her eveninglong piece, a series of brief vignettes set to a wide variety of music, matches the unforgettably individual faces of elderly men and women she videotaped at a center just west of the Port Authority Bus Terminal.</p>
        <p>Stephanie Lyon, the performer who plays the character of the same name, has an appealingly waiflike fragility, in a cast completed by Jorge Cardenas, Erin Parsley Sutton, Simone Da Silva, Blanche Hampton, Thomas Holt, Jessica Vascellaro and Julio Cesar Diaz. All deserve better.</p>
