        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mainstream gay and lesbian folks owe much to the radicals who blazed the trail in the early 1970's (news article, June 25). But unlike the radicals, most of us aren't interested in dismantling the society in which we grew up. We simply want equal treatment under the law and the right to live our lives without the threat of discrimination, hostility and anti-gay violence.</p>

        <p>No question that the goals of the collective gay rights movement have broadened and changed. But as evidenced from the extraordinary diversity and vitality of the recent gay rights march on Washington and the annual celebration here in New York, the gay rights movement has become a powerful force. And given how much remains to be done -- especially outside the safe precincts of Manhattan -- we will need that diversity and vitality to complete the job begun so courageously three decades ago.</p>
