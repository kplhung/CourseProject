        <p>Following are excerpts from a news conference yesterday at the White House about decoding the human genome, as transcribed by The New York Times. Speaking were President Clinton; Dr. Francis S. Collins, head of the Human Genome Project; and Dr. J. Craig Venter, head of Celera Genomics. Prime Minister Tony Blair participated by satellite.</p>
        <p>President Clinton</p>
        <p>Nearly two centuries ago, in this room, on this floor, Thomas Jefferson and a trusted aide spread out a magnificent map, a map Jefferson had long prayed he would get to see in his lifetime. The aide was Meriwether Lewis and the map was the product of his courageous expedition across the American frontier, all the way to the Pacific. It was a map that defined the contours and forever expanded the frontiers of our continent and our imagination.</p>
        <p>Today the world is joining us here in the East Room to behold the map of even greater significance. We are here to celebrate the completion of the first survey of the entire human genome. Without a doubt, this is the most important, most wondrous map ever produced by humankind.</p>
        <p>The moment we are here to witness was brought about through brilliant and painstaking work of scientists all over the world, including many men and women here today. It was not even 50 years ago that a young Englishman named Crick and a brash, even younger, American named Watson first discovered the elegant structure of our genetic code. Dr. Watson, the way you announced your discovery in the journal Nature was one of the great understatements of all time: ''This structure has novel features which are of considerable biological interest.''</p>
        <p>Thank you, sir.</p>
        <p>How far we have come since that day. In the intervening years we have pooled the combined wisdom of biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, mathematics and computer science, tapped the great strengths and insights of the public and private sectors. More than a thousand researchers across six nations have revealed nearly all three billion letters of our miraculous genetic code.</p>
        <p>I congratulate all of you on this stunning and humbling achievement.</p>
        <p>Today's announcement represents more than just an epoch-making triumph of science and reason. After all, when Galileo discovered he could use the tools of mathematics and mechanics to understand the motion of celestial bodies, he felt, in the words of one eminent researcher, that he had learned the language in which God created the universe.</p>
        <p>Today we are learning the language in which God created life. We are gaining ever more awe for the complexity, the beauty, the wonder of God's most divine and sacred gift. With this profound new knowledge, humankind is on the verge of gaining immense new power to heal. . . .</p>
        <p>But today's historic achievement is only a starting point. There is much hard work yet to be done. And that is why I'm so pleased to announce that from this moment forward, the robust and healthy competition that has led us to this day and that always is essential to the progress of science, will be coupled with enhanced public-private cooperation. Public and private research teams are committed to publishing their genomic data simultaneously later this year for the benefit of researchers in every corner of the globe. And after publication, both sets of teams will join together for an historic sequence analysis conference. Together they will examine what scientific insights have been gleaned from both efforts and how we can most judiciously proceed toward the next majestic horizons.</p>
        <p>What are those next horizons? Well, first we will complete a virtually error-free final draft of the human genome before the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the double helix, less than three years from now.</p>
        <p>Second, through sustained and vigorous support for public and private research, we must sort through this trove of genomic data to identify every human gene. We must discover the function of these genes and their protein products. And then we must rapidly convert that knowledge into treatments that can lengthen and enrich lives. I want to emphasize that biotechnology companies are absolutely essential in this endeavor. For it is they who will bring to the market the life-enhancing applications of the information from the human genome. And for that reason this administration is committed to helping them to make the kind of long-term investments that will change the face of medicine forever.</p>
        <p>The third horizon that lies before us is one that science cannot approach alone. It is the horizon that represents the ethical, moral and spiritual dimension of the power we now possess. We must not shrink from exploring that far frontier of science. But as we consider how to use new discoveries, we must also not retreat from our oldest and most cherished human values. We must ensure that new genome science and its benefits will be directed toward making life better for all citizens of the world, never just a privileged few. As we unlock the secrets of the human genome, we must work simultaneously to ensure that new discoveries never pry open the doors of privacy. And we must guarantee that genetic information cannot be used to stigmatize or discriminate against any individual or group. Increasing knowledge of the human genome must never change the basic belief on which our ethics, our government and our society are founded. All of us are created equal, entitled to equal treatment under the law.</p>
        <p>After all, I believe one of the great truths to emerge from this triumphant expedition inside the human genome is that in genetic terms all human beings, regardless of race, are more than 99.9 percent the same. What that means is that modern science has confirmed what we first learned from ancient faiths. The most important fact of life on this earth is our common humanity.</p>
        <p>My greatest wish on this day for the ages is that this incandescent truth will always guide our actions as we continue to march forth in this, the greatest age of discovery ever known.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair</p>
        <p>I think of my little boy, Leo, growing up and learning and knowing things that his grandfather, after whom he was named, could not even have dreamt of. And when you contemplate that, it's almost not like different generations but different eras of human existence.</p>
        <p>And there are enormous possibilities for him and his generation but also some dangers. And our job is to try and develop the possibilities and thwart the dangers.</p>
        <p>Ever since Francis Crick and Jim Watson, another great Anglo-American scientific partnership, made their historic discovery in the middle of the last century, we've known that DNA was the code to life on earth. And yet I guess, for Crick and Watson, the process of identifying the billions of units of DNA and piecing them together to form a working blueprint of the human race must have seemed almost a superhuman task beyond the reach of their generation.</p>
        <p>And yet today, it is all but complete. Nothing better demonstrates the way technology and science are driving us -- fast-forwarding us -- all into the future.</p>
        <p>But with the power of this discovery comes, of course, the responsibility to use it wisely. As with the greatest scientific achievements, the ethical and the moral questions raised by this astonishing breakthrough are profound.</p>
        <p>We, all of us, share a duty to ensure that the common property of the human genome is used freely for the common good of the whole human race. To ensure that the powerful information now at our disposal is used to transform medicine, not abused, to make man his own creator or invade individual privacy.</p>
        <p>We cannot resist change. But our job, indeed our duty, is to make sense of change, to help people through it, to seize the massive opportunities for better health and a better quality of life and then, with equal vigor, to minimize the threats such developments pose.</p>
        <p>Dr. Francis S. Collins</p>
        <p>Science is a voyage of exploration into the unknown. We are here today to celebrate a milestone along a truly unprecedented voyage. This one into ourselves.</p>
        <p>Alexander Pope wrote: ''Know then, thyself. Presume not God to scan. The proper study of mankind is man.'' What more powerful form of study of mankind could there be than to read our own instruction book? I've been privileged over the last seven years to lead an international team of more than a thousand of some of the best and brightest scientists of our current generation, some of them here in this room, who have been truly dedicated to this goal.</p>
        <p>Today we celebrate the revelation of the first draft of the human book of life. Already more than a dozen genes responsible for diseases from deafness to kidney disease to cancer have been identified using this resource just in the last year. So there is much to celebrate.</p>
        <p>But I have to tell you that this morning is also a bittersweet experience for me personally. Less than 24 hours ago, I attended the funeral of by beloved sister-in-law, a wonderful marionette artist who brought magic and joy to thousands of children with her art. She died much too soon, of breast cancer. The hope and promise of understanding all of the genes in the genome and applying this knowledge to the development of powerful new tools, came just too late for her.</p>
        <p>I think I speak for all of us in this room and for the millions of others who have come to believe in the remarkable promise of biomedical research, that we must redouble our efforts to speed the application of these profound and fundamental observations about the human genome to the cure of disease. That most desirable of all outcomes will only come about with a continued, powerful and dedicated partnership between basic science investigators in academia and their colleagues in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.</p>
        <p>It is humbling for me and awe-inspiring to realize that we have caught the first glimpse of our own instruction book, previously known only to God. What a profound responsibility it is to do this work. Historians will consider this a turning point. Researchers in a few years will have trouble imagining how we studied human biology without the genome sequence in front of us.</p>
        <p>I particularly welcome the opportunity to celebrate this moment jointly with our scientific colleagues at Celera Genomics. And I wish to express my personal gratitude to Dr. Craig Venter for his openness in the cooperative planning process that led to this joint announcement. I am happy that today the only race we are talking about is the human race.</p>
        <p>Dr. J. Craig Venter</p>
        <p>The method used by Celera has determined the genetic code of five individuals. We have sequenced the genome of three females and two males who have identified themselves as Hispanic, Asian, Caucasian or African-American. We did the sampling not in an exclusionary way, but out of respect for the diversity that is America and to help illustrate that the concept of race has no genetic or scientific basis.</p>
        <p>In the five Celera genomes, there's no way to tell one ethnicity from another. Society and medicine treat us all as members of populations, whereas as individuals we are all unique and population statistics do not apply. . . .</p>
        <p>Obviously our achievements would not have been possible without the efforts of the thousands of scientists around the world who have gone before us in the quest to better understand life at its most basic level. The beauty of science is that all important discoveries are made by building on the discoveries of others. I continue to be inspired by the work of the pioneering men and women in the broad array of disciplines that had been brought together to enable this great accomplishment. . . .</p>
        <p>One of the wonderful discoveries that my colleagues and I have made while decoding the DNA of over two dozen species, from viruses to bacteria to plants to insects and now human beings, is that we are all connected to the commonality of the genetic code and evolution. When life is reduced to its very essence we find that we have many genes in common with every species on earth and that we are not so different from one another. You may be surprised to learn that your sequences are greater than 90 percent identical to proteins in other animals.</p>
        <p>It's my belief that the basic knowledge that we are providing the world will have a profound impact on the human condition and the treatments for disease and our view of our place in the biological continuum.</p>
