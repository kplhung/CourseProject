        <p>Three large New York research institutions will form a $160 million biology research center, paid for in part with a donation from an anonymous patron.</p>
        <p>The program, a venture by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Rockefeller University and the Weill Medical College of Cornell University, is the latest of several efforts among major New York medical and research centers to collaborate on large scientific projects.</p>
        <p>Joint projects, anathema in New York research circles only a few years ago, have become increasingly necessary as the cost of such work has skyrocketed and as the work, exemplified by the human genome project, has become too complex for most centers to undertake on their own.</p>
        <p>The new joint initiative, known as the Tri-Institutional Research Program, is expected to be announced today. It is to consist of shared laboratories and equipment and will recruit faculty members from all over the country in the next 5 to 10 years to conduct research that will focus on chemical, computational and cancer biology.</p>
        <p>The gift, although not the largest to a medical institution, is especially substantial for an anonymous donor.</p>
        <p>Historically, New York's medical schools, hospitals and research institutions have guarded their own research, with unfortunate consequences. Other states like Maryland and California have invested more public and private funds in the development of biological research and product development and have reaped huge financial and intellectual rewards.</p>
        <p>In recent years, New York has watched as money for biomedical research has gravitated to other states: New York has slipped from the first to the third biggest recipient of federal grants. Not a single New York research institution was chosen, for instance, to participate in the human genome sequencing project, whose results were announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>''If these three institutions had done this 10 years ago,'' said Arnold J. Levine, president of Rockefeller University, ''we might have been one of the centers in which genome sequencing would have occurred. We have now found that we must collaborate to be great.''</p>
        <p>Other major collaborations have been announced in the last few years by New York's medical research centers. One is the New York Structural Biology Center, a consortium of 10 medical institutions using magnets to study molecules.</p>
        <p>Another group, the Academic Medicine Development Company, was formed a few years ago with 34 institutions around the state for joint purchases and research. Among its projects is a $12 million cancer study that will track the health habits of 300,000 residents. Another is the Biomedical Research Alliance of New York, which works with manufacturers on drug trials.</p>
