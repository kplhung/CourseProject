        <p>Three bronze medals and three silver medals were awarded to young dancers on Sunday night at Alice Tully Hall at a ceremony concluding the Sixth New York International Ballet Competition. The competition attracted 48 dancers from 18 countries,  and the gala was the culmination of a three-week period during which all participants learned and were judged on an identical repertory. They also had opportunities to show works chosen on their own.</p>
        <p>A panel of dancers, teachers and choreographers awarded bronze medals in the women's division to Hye Min Hwang (South Korea) and Emi Hariyama (Japan). A men's bronze medal went to Rene Salazar (Brazil). Sarah Lamb of the Boston Ballet received a women's silver medal; Ilya Kozadayev and Mikhail Ilyin (both of Russia) won men's silver medals.</p>
        <p>This year there were no gold medals for dancers. But an honorary gold medal for lifetime achievement went to Arthur Mitchell, the artistic director of Dance Theater of Harlem. The presentation was made by Frederic Franklin, the former star of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, who for several decades has been an adviser to many companies, including Mr. Mitchell's. Upon receiving the award, Mr. Mitchell, quoting Martha Graham, said that ''dancers are angels of God.''</p>
        <p>The competition was founded in 1984 by Igor Youskevitch, who died in 1994, and Ilona Copen, who continues as executive director; Eleanor D'Antuono serves as artistic director. To promote high standards, its directors and judges have always been chary about awarding gold medals. The competition has been held every three or four years and, of the past five events, two were without gold-medal presentations.</p>
        <p>The competition is open to dancers between the ages of 17 and 24. All must learn three assigned pieces of choreography, but those works are not announced until the dancers arrive in New York.</p>
        <p>This year's selections were Balanchine's ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux,'' coached by Deborah Wingert; the grand pas de deux from Petipa's ''Sleeping Beauty,'' coached by Winthrop Corey, and the ''Giggling Rapids'' sequence from Alvin Ailey's ''River,'' coached by Mucuy Bolles. Lupe Serrano, Stephen Pier and Luis Fuente taught the dancers during the three-week period. Liliane Montevecchi, who has been a star of Roland Petit's Ballets de Paris and of such Broadway shows as ''Grand Hotel'' and ''Nine,'' served as master of ceremonies. The awards ceremony was followed by a performance by this year's winners, other finalists and some winners and finalists from previous competitions. The dancers were eager and attractive, yet several performances had rough edges. And some of the works presented that were not part of the competition syllabus were choreographically undistinguished.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Hariyama offered a delicate variation from ''The Sleeping Beauty.'' Ms. Hwang was secure in a solo from ''Le Corsaire,'' although her dancing could benefit from a greater sense of flow. Mr. Salazar and Priscilla Yokoi, another Brazilian dancer, were gleeful in ''Giggling Rapids.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lamb brought dignity and radiance to the ''Sleeping Beauty'' pas de deux, for which her partner was Zack Grubbs, also of the Boston Ballet.</p>
        <p>Partnering Mirai Noda of Japan, Mr. Ilyin looked at home in the ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux.'' Mr. Kozadayev leaped lightly througn a solo from Petipa's ''Rest of the Cavalry.''</p>
        <p>Other finalists who danced were Marnie Shapiro, Emily Grizzell and Joel Prouty (United States), Rosa Antuna (Brazil), Kenny Wang (Taiwan), Neli Beliakaite (Lithuania), Cong Ma (China), Diana Stetsura (Belarus), Eivar Sair (Venezuela) and Altanhuyag Dugarai (Mongolia).</p>
        <p>Dancers from previous competitions who participated included Christina Theryoung, Venti Petrov, David Kierce and four dancers now with American Ballet Theater: Anna Liceica, Gillian Murphy, Gennadi Saveliev and Carlos Molina.</p>
        <p>The performance by Ms. Liceica and Mr. Molina of the Black Swan adagio from ''Swan Lake'' was especially notable for its elegance and sense of drama.</p>
        <p>Competition judges were Cynthia Gregory, chairwoman, and Karen Kain, Carla Fracci, Jean-Christophe Maillot, Julio Bocca, Boris Eifman, Zhao Ruheng and Rudi van Dantzig.</p>
