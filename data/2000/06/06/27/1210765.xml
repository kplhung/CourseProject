        <p>After acting decisively and boldly in an attempt to add Juan Gonzalez to their lineup, the Yankees yesterday ended their effort with a whimper. With Gonzalez poised to join them with a multiyear extension of his contract, the Yankees made a one-year $12.5 million offer that ensured the death of their deal with Detroit.</p>
        <p>The Yankees were said to have stepped up their effort to get the Cubs' Sammy Sosa. A person with knowledge of Yankee developments said talks between the teams heated up yesterday, but the Cubs continued to make a steep request in both quality and quantity of players.</p>
        <p>The fact that the Yankees did not aggressively negotiate with Gonzalez's agent heightened suspicion that they had used him to try to induce the Cubs to reduce their demands.</p>
        <p>''I think that's true,'' a baseball official said, speaking from instinct rather than inside information. ''There's no better way of putting pressure on the other guy than what they're doing.''</p>
        <p>But now that the Gonzalez initiative has ended, the Cubs seem to face no viable competition for the Yankees' desire to add a productive hitter.</p>
        <p>The Yankees never acknowledged that they agreed last Thursday to send Ricky Ledee and two minor league players to the Tigers for Gonzalez, pending Gonzalez's approval, but yesterday they issued a statement saying they had been unable to ''come to terms'' with Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>Gonzalez, his agent said yesterday, was prepared to waive the no-trade clause and sign a multiyear contract extension with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Initially Gonzalez had said he would accept the trade but didn't want to extend his contract beyond this season.</p>
        <p>Jim Bronner, the agent, said he informed the Yankees of the change in his client's position Sunday, but until late yesterday afternoon, just an hour before the 6 p.m. deadline imposed on their talks, the Yankees had made no offer. Then when they made one, Bronner said, it was for one year, ''which we already told them we didn't want; we wanted no extension or a long-term deal.''</p>
        <p>Bronner, speaking by telephone from Chicago minutes after the deadline had passed, said he twice spoke with George Steinbrenner just before the deadline and tried to persuade the Yankees' principal owner to complete the trade without a contract extension.</p>
        <p>Neither Randy Levine, the team president, nor General Manager Brian Cashman returned calls seeking comment, but the Yankees did not  want to offer Gonzalez the kind of contract the Tigers did during the winter after they acquired him from the Texas Rangers.</p>
        <p>The Tigers, Bronner said, offered an eight-year deal for $143 million, including $20 million in the eighth, or option, year, which either the club or Gonzalez could have exercised. The package included the potential for an additional $7 million in performance bonuses based on awards earned by the 30-year-old outfielder, a two-time American League most valuable player with Texas. He preferred becoming a free agent instead.</p>
        <p>Bronner said he told the Yankees what the Tigers had offered but also told them ''it didn't have to be the same length.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''I said make it something that was economically equivalent to that.''</p>
        <p>But the Yankees, said a person with knowledge of their thinking, did not want to match the basic structure of the Detroit package.</p>
        <p>Bronner said it was in a telephone conversation they had Sunday morning that Gonzalez changed his thinking about accepting the trade only if the Yankees dropped their desire to have him sign a contract extension.</p>
        <p>''I called Juan,'' Bronner related, ''and said, 'If you want to go to the Yankees, the idea of going for three months isn't going to work for either team. They're not going to make a trade on that basis. The Yankees want a hitter. You can wait to become a free agent and chances are that position will be filled by someone else and you won't have the opportunity to go to the Yankees.' So he said he would consider a multiyear offer.''</p>
        <p>The agent said he conveyed that change to Levine later Sunday, after which Steinbrenner called and ''assured me he wanted Juan.''</p>
        <p>In the past, when Steinbrenner has wanted a superstar, he has pursued the player himself. In this instance, though, Bronner said Steinbrenner  told him ''his people'' were going to  handle the negotiations.</p>
        <p>Bronner said he spoke with Levine a couple of times on Sunday, but received no offer. After several attempts to reach Levine were unsuccessful yesterday, Bronner said, they finally spoke. Bronner quoted the club executive as saying, ''We've decided we can't match where Detroit was so we're not going to do anything.''</p>
        <p>Later in the day, though, Levine called with a one-year offer, but it was too late for Bronner to relay it to Gonzalez, who was on the field in Cleveland, before the deadline. But, Bronner said, he knew Gonzalez would not find it acceptable.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have not found the Cubs' proposed packages for Sosa acceptable. One person close to the talks said the Cubs initially wanted seven players for Sosa and pitcher Ismael Valdes.</p>
        <p>Among the names mentioned were Ledee, who is with the Yankees, and the minor leaguers Alfonso Soriano, D'Angelo Jimenez, and Alex Graman, a pitcher who was the Yankees' third-round pick in the 1999 amateur draft.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, meanwhile, were exploring a trade for Ed Sprague, a third baseman with San Diego.</p>
