        <p>Rod Thorn has made his first major decision as president of the Nets, and if recent league history is any indication, it will be a good one.</p>
        <p>Following the successful National Basketball Association trend of hiring former players as coaches, Thorn has settled on Byron Scott as the Nets' new head coach, a member of the YankeeNets organization said yesterday. An announcement could be made as soon as today.</p>
        <p>Scott, who won three championships while playing for the Los Angeles Lakers, has been an assistant coach with the Sacramento Kings for the past two seasons. Thorn could not be reached for comment once it was learned that Scott would get the job, but earlier yesterday he said he hoped to have the position filled this week.</p>
        <p>Thorn will not have much time to celebrate his decision because a second and equally important choice must be made tomorrow, when the Nets choose first in the N.B.A. draft.</p>
        <p>''It's been real busy, joining a team with the No. 1 draft pick and no coach,'' Thorn said with a laugh. ''But it's been entertaining, too.''</p>
        <p>Scott, 39, emerged as the winner from a field that had been whittled to Coach Tubby Smith of the University of Kentucky and the Nets assistant Eddie Jordan. Jordan was endorsed by the Nets' star point guard, Stephon Marbury, and will remain as a member of the team's coaching staff. Jordan turned down an offer to become the first assistant on the Atlanta Hawks' coaching staff yesterday.</p>
        <p>Scott was traded from the San Diego Clippers to the Lakers, along with Swen Nater, for Norm Nixon and Jordan in 1983. That trade helped his playing career tremendously as he teamed with Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy to win titles in 1985, 1987 and 1988.</p>
        <p>After his playing career, Scott, who played 14 years with the Showtime era Lakers and with the Indiana Pacers, became one of the most respected young assistant coaches in the league.</p>
        <p>He was a candidate for head coaching jobs with the Pacers, who will reportedly hire Isiah Thomas, and the Hawks, who hired Lon Kruger, the former University of Illinois coach.</p>
        <p>The Nets are hoping Scott will have the type of success that other former players have recently enjoyed on the sideline. In the last three years, Larry Bird and Doc Rivers, each of whom had no coaching experience before being hired by Indiana and Orlando, respectively, earned coach of the year honors in their first seasons. And both Danny Ainge and Scott Skiles have recently had great success coaching the Phoenix Suns.</p>
        <p>Scott, who averaged 14.1 points for his career, is comparable to Rivers in that he had a long and solid N.B.A. career and played for some of the league's best coaches. Three of them -- Pat Riley, Mike Dunleavy and Del Harris -- have been voted coach of the year, and the fourth, Larry Brown, is recognized as one of the league's elite.</p>
        <p>With the Nets, Scott will join a team in major transition but one that also holds major promise. Thorn, the former N.B.A. executive vice president for basketball operations, was hired by the Nets on June 2, only a few weeks after the luck of the draw gave the Nets the top pick in the draft.</p>
        <p>While a trade is possible -- Orlando is offering the 5th and 10th picks -- the Nets are likely to keep the pick and take the Cincinnati power forward Kenyon Martin.</p>
        <p>In addition to being the best player in the draft, the 6-foot-9-inch Martin can go a long way in filling the huge hole the Nets have in their frontcourt because of the troubles of Jayson Williams.</p>
        <p>Williams, who has not played since breaking his right leg on April 1, 1999, will be declared a permanent medical disability by the league within the next week, ending his nine-year playing career.</p>
        <p>''We're just waiting to get the i's dotted and the t's crossed,'' Thorn said. ''It's a shame because Jayson has tried to rehab as hard and as consistently as he possibly can.''</p>
        <p>In accordance with the Disabled Player Exception, the Nets will be able to sign a free agent for roughly $3.8 million. Williams's salary of $86 million over six years will come off the Nets' salary cap figure on April 1, 2000.</p>
        <p>The Nets are also facing the possible loss of Kerry Kittles, who underwent a cartilage transplant on his right knee two weeks ago and will miss at least half of the regular season.</p>
        <p>But in Marbury, Keith Van Horn and perhaps Martin, the new coach will have a lot to work with nonetheless.</p>
