        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re Thomas L. Friedman's June 20 column about the Worker Rights Consortium and its anti-sweatshop efforts: Mr. Friedman asserts that the consortium has had ''zero'' effect. But as a result of the W.R.C. and student-organizing efforts, companies that said they would never disclose information about specific factories now say they are willing to do so. Further, all universities affiliated with the Fair Labor Association have just announced that they will require such disclosure from their licensees.</p>

        <p>Re Thomas L. Friedman's June 20 column about the Worker Rights Consortium and its anti-sweatshop efforts: Mr. Friedman asserts that the consortium has had ''zero'' effect. But as a result of the W.R.C. and student-organizing efforts, companies that said they would never disclose information about specific factories now say they are willing to do so. Further, all universities affiliated with the Fair Labor Association have just announced that they will require such disclosure from their licensees.</p>
        <p>The Worker Rights Consortium  stands for independent monitoring and full public disclosure of factory locations, monitoring reports and wage levels -- steps needed to turn the tide on sweatshops.</p>
        <p>The college presidents who support the consortium have demonstrated that universities are still incubators for important values in our society.</p>
