        <p>For Canadians tired of maple leaves or airbrushed photos of the queen on their stamps, Canada Post suggests the 21st-century alternative: personalize your postage with a photo of the new baby, the new graduate, the happy couple or the loyal dog.</p>
        <p>Vanity stamps, the latest product for an ego-centered age, made their debut in Canada on May 6, and the response has been overwhelming. ''We are getting 400 to 500 orders a day,'' said Tim McGurrin, spokesman for Canada Post, the state-run postal service. ''The buzz has tipped us off that we are really onto something big.''</p>
        <p>Here at Calgary's main post office, sales clerks were handing out photocopied order forms only one week after the national launch. A clerk said apologetically, ''They only gave us 50 brochures, and they are gone already.''</p>
        <p>From Ottawa, Mr. McGurrin, who has ordered one sheet of stamps featuring his own photo and one sheet featuring his 2-year-old daughter, explained that people wanting to personalize their postage needed only to fill out a form, mail in a photo and send payment. (Order forms and instructions can also be downloaded from the Canada Post Web site, www.canadapost.ca).</p>
        <p>Within about three weeks, applicants receive in the mail a sheet of 25 self-sticking printed ''gilt frames,'' marked ''Canada'' and ''46'' -- for Canada's domestic letter rate. This  comes with a second sheet of 25 ''personalized self-adhesive photo stickers,'' or ''vignettes autocollantes'' in French. After sticking the frame on the upper right hand side of an envelope, the letter writer places the photo sticker in the center of the frame.</p>
        <p>Each sheet costs $24.95 Canadian, plus tax, or more than double the cost of a sheet of 25 normal domestic-rate stamps.</p>
        <p>''Canada Post is ripping us off again,'' grumbled Dwayne Miner, owner of Stampede City Stamps, a stamp shop next to the main post office here. ''It costs a dollar, but you only get 46 cents of postage. Who's going to pay a buck to mail a letter?''</p>
        <p>Despite his grumbling, Mr. Miner confessed that he, too, had fallen for Canada Post's latest promotion to milk money from collectors and the public. He said that at a national stamp show in Winnipeg in late April, where the personalized stamps were previewed by collectors, he had  joined an hourlong line to have stamps made of ''my beautiful self.'' Now he is ordering stamps of ''Simon -- he's my buddy, a Bernese Mountain Dog.''</p>
        <p>In recent months, Australia, Britain, Singapore and Switzerland have started to offer customers the option of buying stamps with their photo printed on attached tabs.</p>
        <p>The United States Postal Service, however, has no plans to allow Americans to personalize their postage. Don Smeraldi, a Postal Service spokesman, said in an interview, ''Having an individual on a stamp would personalize it to the extent that we wouldn't have a good return on printing stamps, because we print them in the millions.''</p>
        <p>In contrast, Canada is exploring more ways for people to express their individuality with stamps. Along with the photo stamps, Canada Post has issued five different greeting stickers that can be placed in the gilt frames. These stickers, which include a heart, a pen and the word ''Surprise,'' ''will allow customers to customize their correspondence according to mood or message,'' said Micheline Montreuil, Canada Post's director of stamp products.</p>
        <p>''While Australia led the way in personalized postage tabs, Canada Post goes one step further by creating a truly custom stamp,'' reads the current issue of Canada Stamp Details, a Canada Post publication for collectors. ''Canada Post holds the worldwide patent for the double-sticker greeting stamp and is investigating more possible uses for this creative offering.''</p>
        <p>In early July, Americans will be able to buy instant personalized stamps when Canada Post sets up its traveling personalized stamp printing machine at a major stamp show in Anaheim, Calif. Collectors say that this essentially is a legal way of printing money, since few American collectors will use their stamps to mail letters from Canada.</p>
        <p>For collectors, personalized stamps pose a challenge because variations could be as extensive as names in the telephone book.</p>
        <p>Charles J. G. Verge, president of the Royal Philatelic Society of Canada, said, ''I think they're going to be more popular with the general public than they'll be with collectors.''</p>
        <p>Reflecting on his three daughters in college, he predicted more orders: ''They're all graduating in the next three years, so I imagine I'll do stamps of their graduation pictures.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McGurrin said Canada Post had also fielded a number of calls from small businesses asking if they could order stamps with their logo. His response: ''Absolutely! Anything within good taste is pretty much going to be accepted.''</p>
        <p>To avoid legal unpleasantness, customers signing ''picture postage'' order forms must confirm that they have ''the necessary copyright and consent permission'' for the images. In addition, Ashton Potter Canada Inc., the Ontario printer that has started printing the photo sheets, vows to reject all obscene, racially biased or any other content deemed inappropriate ''for any reason.''</p>
