        <p>General Motors is beginning a review for the American media planning account of its Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Oldsmobile and Pontiac divisions. The assignment involves deciding where to run advertising. The company spends $2.6 billion annually on advertising, making this the largest account review ever on Madison Avenue.</p>
        <p>Peg Holmes, a spokeswoman for General Motors in Detroit, confirmed reports of the review this week in Advertising Age and Adweek.</p>
        <p>The national and regional assignment, now handled by 17 agencies, could be consolidated at a single agency that would be formed to handle that task in much the same way G.M. Mediaworks in Warren, Mich., a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, handles consolidated American media buying.</p>
        <p>There are three participants in the review, Ms. Holmes said: the B Com3  Group in Chicago; Carat North America in New York, part of the Aegis Group; and Interpublic. The planning assignments are now about evenly divided between B Com3  agencies like Starcom Mediavest and Interpublic agencies like Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners. Media buying and creative assignments are unaffected by the review, which could be concluded by the end of the summer.</p>
