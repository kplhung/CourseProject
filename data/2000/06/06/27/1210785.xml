        <p>Maybe it is easier speaking from the top of the men's draw, but Pete Sampras had little sympathy for the boycott by Alex Corretja and Albert Costa, both of whom withdrew from Wimbledon after being snubbed by the All England Club's seeding system.</p>
        <p>Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam event to ignore the tour rankings and create its own seedings. But if, say, the French Open chose the same route, then the clay-court awkward Sampras could be left with a tougher draw as a lower-seeded player -- if he was seeded at all.</p>

        <p>Maybe it is easier speaking from the top of the men's draw, but Pete Sampras had little sympathy for the boycott by Alex Corretja and Albert Costa, both of whom withdrew from Wimbledon after being snubbed by the All England Club's seeding system.</p>
        <p>Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam event to ignore the tour rankings and create its own seedings. But if, say, the French Open chose the same route, then the clay-court awkward Sampras could be left with a tougher draw as a lower-seeded player -- if he was seeded at all.</p>
        <p>Sampras's response to such a situation is simple: just play. ''You know if I didn't get seeded at the French, I'd go out there and try to do well to prove to the event that I'm worthy of being seeded,'' said Sampras, whose best finish at the French Open was as a semifinalist in 1996. ''You really try to rise above it instead of being a little childish about it and going home. It's a bit disappointing.''</p>
        <p>Sampras's fault-finding with Corretja and Costa came as a bit of a surprise considering the criticism he has received in the past for his light tennis schedule, spotty commitment to the Davis Cup team and noncommitment to play on the Olympic team.</p>
        <p>Usually, Sampras is more reserved in his critiques of his fellow players. But Sampras seems more open these days, more at ease with who he is, less concerned with perception.</p>
        <p>To illuminate this further, he was asked just how he proposed to his fiancee, Bridgette Wilson. Was he a romantic at the moment of truth?</p>
        <p>''You know me,'' Sampras said to a chorus of laughs. ''I'm not so boring after all.''</p>
        <p>Gloss Is Not a Problem</p>
        <p>Anna Kournikova's omnipresence inside London's tube -- adorning posters that reveal her in a sports bra with the slogan: ''Only the balls should bounce'' -- has only added to the hype and frenzy surrounding the tour's It Girl.</p>
        <p>There is resentment by some players toward so much attention being given to a player who has yet to win a title on the tour. But with an eye for fashion, and love for attention-getting outfits herself, Serena Williams dismissed those who see Kournikova as all gloss and no game.</p>
        <p>''I have no problem with Anna,'' Williams said. ''I get along with her just fine. What's the problem? I don't see a problem with what she's doing. I don't even see what she's doing. She's just being herself. It seems like everyone has a problem with it.''</p>
        <p>Early Retirement Plan</p>
        <p>Richard Williams has predicted early retirement for his daughters, Venus and Serena, and seems continually concerned over how they might be wasting their youth on more tennis instead of more education.</p>
        <p>''There is so much more they could do,'' Williams said. ''You have to think of the longevity for your life. This is very temporary. It won't be long before you realize this is over with. The next girl, or next boy, they're already looking for them.</p>
        <p>''It depends on them, but if I had the decision to make, I think they have enough money to say, 'Let's go home now.' If it was my decision, I'd say 'Let's go home, get in those convertibles and ride off.' ''</p>
        <p>Serena Williams is perfectly fine with the word ''retirement'' and understands her father's comments. But she is more inclined to say farewell in five or six years.</p>
        <p>''He's always preaching that to us,'' Serena said, speaking for her sister, Venus, too. ''We're trying to do our best. When we have time, we're trying to get our little degrees to have something to fall back on.''</p>
        <p>No Excuses</p>
        <p>Vince Spadea's celebration today was Greg Rusedski's low moment. Although he was born in Canada, Rusedski has adopted Britain as his home. Despite having the crowd behind him, he could not extend Spadea's record losing streak.</p>
        <p>Like Spadea, Rusedski has struggled. Almost inexplicably, he has been tinkering with his serve even though at around 130 miles an hour it is one of the best in the game.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to make any excuses,'' Rusedski said. ''It's just not going very well at the moment.''</p>
        <p>Now Britain's hopes are with Tim Henman, who opens his first-round match with Paradom Srichaphan of Thailand on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''I think the expectation is very high, and they would like to have a champion,'' Rusedski said. ''Hopefully, Tim can go out and play well and have a good chance.''</p>
