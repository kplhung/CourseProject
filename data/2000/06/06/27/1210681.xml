        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Free Syria's Jews'' (letter, June 20), which implied that Jews in Syria continue to be held as prisoners and are forbidden to leave:</p>
        <p>Although terror and intimidation were hallmarks of Hafez al-Assad's regime, the Syrian dictator was finally persuaded to allow Jews to leave Syria in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>I served then as chairman of the National Task Force on Syrian Jewry of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and was involved in the rescue of some 4,000 Syrian Jews, who included all those who wished to leave. The few hundred who chose to remain did so because they did not want to abandon their ancestral homes.</p>
        <p>It is true that one of the conditions set by Mr. Assad was a prohibition against the emigration of the departing Jews to Israel. But in actual practice, this proved to be no obstacle, since those who wished to resettle in Israel did so by first traveling to interim destinations like Cyprus.</p>
