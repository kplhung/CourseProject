        <p>Noontime in Manhattan, and the strap-style T-shirt brigade was out.</p>
        <p>Mali Heled, a 26-year-old doctoral candidate at Cambridge University in England, was taking a break outside a sandwich shop on West 42nd Street, across from the New York Public Library, where she had spent the morning reading James Joyce manuscripts.

        <p>Noontime in Manhattan, and the strap-style T-shirt brigade was out.</p>
        <p>Mali Heled, a 26-year-old doctoral candidate at Cambridge University in England, was taking a break outside a sandwich shop on West 42nd Street, across from the New York Public Library, where she had spent the morning reading James Joyce manuscripts. She wore a flimsy fuchsia skirt and the sort of white ribbed undershirt one associates with Arnold Schwarzenegger when he has to change a tire on his Hummer.</p>
        <p>''In the library I wear a jean jacket because I like to be a little more covered,'' Ms. Heled said, surveying the many women passing by in similarly skimpy attire, often with bra straps showing. ''But out here I think it's perfectly O.K. to dress like this.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in Bryant Park, Nicola Thompson, 25, was catching some sun before heading back to work. Ms. Thompson, a paralegal at a Midtown law firm, was wearing a rose-print dress with spaghetti straps -- a style that, until the advent of more casual business dress codes, one might have seen in SoHo on a weekend but rarely on a Tuesday in Midtown. Ms. Thompson said she has no hesitation about wearing this kind of dress to work, though she usually covers it with a sweater. ''It's a young law firm -- my boss is only 33,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Like a number of women interviewed on the street, Ms. Thompson suggested that more liberal office dress policies aren't the only force behind an explosion of tank tops, bare-toe high heels, clingy skirts and midriff-revealing knits. ''I think American women are much more comfortable now showing more,'' she said.</p>
        <p>It may not come as news to people in the fashion industry, or even to women who take their cues about modesty and skirt lengths from television programs like ''Sex and the City,'' but there has been a conspicuous change in the landscape in the past two summers. It wasn't all that long ago that such seemingly chaste styles as sleeveless dresses and open-toe shoes were verboten in most offices. And as for going without stockings -- that, too, was something you didn't see except around the offices of Vogue.</p>
        <p>But like mushrooms after a rain, all these styles are popping up with a persistence and an elan that suggest a change in the way women view themselves and clothes.</p>
        <p>What's more, say retailers and social observers, the attitude isn't confined to trendy urbanites and runway-ready 20-somethings. Banana Republic says a stretchy strap-style tank top (with built-in breast support) is among its most popular looks. Ellen Tracy, a label for midlevel career women, says its button-down work shirt cropped to show off the bellybutton is a hit. And the surge of bare-it fashion is also attracting older women and heavier women.</p>
        <p>''There has been a decided shift to a sexy, glamorous, almost trashy interpretation of fashion,'' said Connie Marsh, trend and design manager for Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, whose 860 stores serve middle-income people across the country. ''Performing best are more bare items like very plunging necklines on T-shirts or halter tops.''</p>
        <p>The appetite for styles that hug the figure or reveal much of it is causing a shift in the retail world. American Eagle Outfitters and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, whose baggy silhouettes made them the cool shops for teenagers of the mid-1990's, have suffered a slowdown. But comebacks are being reported at Guess, which grew to prominence in the 1980's showcasing the curvaceous bodies of Anna Nicole Smith and Claudia Schiffer in revealing tops and skintight jeans, and at the Limited, with its streetwise style.</p>
        <p>The last time that sexy was this big was the 1970's, but fashion historians see a big difference between the satin-blouse braless look popular in the disco era and the styles today. ''Then that kind of outfit was for partying,'' said Susan Bordo, a humanities professor at the University of Kentucky who has written several books on body image. ''Now it has a place in the office.''</p>
        <p>Professor Bordo said that popular culture and in particular two television shows, ''Ally McBeal'' and ''Sex and the City,'' have contributed to the change. ''A decade ago, the feminist ideal was to have a great career and a family,'' she said. ''Now the ideal is to have a great career and dress like a sex kitten, too.''</p>
        <p>But in this new era, dressing like a sex kitten does not necessarily mean wanting to be one. States of public undress do not connote licentiousness as much as they did even a decade ago. ''The trend toward skimpiness does not seem to be correlated to sexual liberation the way it was in the 1960's and 70's,'' said Valerie Steele, a historian at the Fashion Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>Clothing's former signals are disappearing. ''Fashion has lost its meaning as a signifier,'' said Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York. ''Someone can be showing lots of leg -- it doesn't mean they are a lap dancer, the same way having a pierced body part no longer means you are an interesting person. Everyone is doing it.''</p>
        <p>For many, dressing sexily is as much about power and entitlement as about attracting mates. Younger women are moving the unapologetically sexy look into even the most buttoned-down corporate suites. Mati Bonetti, 27, recently left a marketing job at the tobacco giant Philip Morris, where she felt totally at home wearing capri pants, sheer skirts and mules. Asked what she would say to a supervisor who questioned her attire, Ms. Bonetti, who is about to start a job at MTV, replied, ''I'd say, 'Well, I don't think I am insulting you.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bonetti, who has a graduate business degree from Columbia University, added, ''You know, a lot of women say to themselves: 'I have an M.B.A. under my belt. I work hard. I don't have to prove anything.' ''</p>
        <p>At a big accounting firm, a 22-year-old recruit (who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions) has been defying the dress code by wearing sleeveless sweaters, T-shirts in clingy polyester and knee-high boots. ''I know it might not be 100 percent appropriate,'' she confessed, ''but I fault those who would judge me on what I wear.''</p>
        <p>The younger generation's sense that it is fine to look sexy -- very much cultivated by the fashion magazines and retailers -- has spread to older women and heavier women, who in previous fashion cycles shied from provocative clothing. ''I never hear shoppers saying, 'This is too young for me,' the way they did a decade ago,'' said Joe Denofrio, senior vice president of Macy's East. ''Though sometimes I wish we did.''</p>
        <p>At Kirna Zabete, a chic SoHo boutique, Beth Shepherd, a co-owner, said that not long ago a personal shopper requested ''a little nothing skirt'' for a client, a woman in her late 50's. Ms. Shepherd said she asked if the woman planned to wear a layer under the see-through garment, and the shopper retorted, ''She doesn't wear slips.''</p>
        <p>And at Lane Bryant, cotton stretch tube tops in bold colors and Hawaiian prints are emerging as favorites among customers, who wear large sizes. ''They are blowing out the door not only in our small sizes, 14 and 16,'' said Chris Hansen, the executive vice president for marketing, ''but across the board, all the way up to Sizes 26 and 28.''</p>
        <p>Lane Bryant applauds the change among its customers. ''It has taken us four years to move the fashion offering and the confidence of our shopper to the point where she feels she is deserving of the same looks as a Size 4,'' Ms. Hansen said.</p>
        <p>Ashley Alderfer, a high school student and an aspiring actress in Manhattan, described her own shift in Size 16 clothes. ''I've recently gotten into halter tops, because they show off my back,'' she said. ''I've only recently become more comfortable with my body type, but the reaction is pretty positive. People say, 'Why not?' ''</p>
        <p>If the fashion cognoscenti are right, the desire to undress will not end with hot weather. Style watchers are expecting an equally provocative fall. Handkerchief halter tops in cashmere and alpaca have already been ordered by stores in record numbers. Also hot are suede boots with stiletto heels.</p>
        <p>''For fall and spring 2001, we think sexy will be even bigger,'' said Mr. Denofrio of Macy's. ''This fall leather will be the uniform, and you are going to see it for men's as well. Forget baggy pants. The form-fitting rib-neck, stretch pants and leather blazer -- that will be the uniform.''</p>
