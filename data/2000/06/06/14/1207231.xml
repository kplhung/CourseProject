        <p>MILLIONS of fathers may stifle yawns this Sunday as they receive bottles of Scotch, Cognac and other predictable gifts, the beverage equivalents of ties and after-shave. But here's a chance to cross everybody up and reward Dad with something unexpected: a bottle of rose.</p>
        <p>No, I'm not joking. Whatever you think of roses, they are not merely wine doilies, pink and blushing. A world of roses exists beyond cheap insipid blends and candy-sweet white zinfandels. Made properly, roses are among the world's most refreshing summer wines, excellent with food and, if not conventionally masculine, at least highly romantic.</p>

        <p>MILLIONS of fathers may stifle yawns this Sunday as they receive bottles of Scotch, Cognac and other predictable gifts, the beverage equivalents of ties and after-shave. But here's a chance to cross everybody up and reward Dad with something unexpected: a bottle of rose.</p>
        <p>No, I'm not joking. Whatever you think of roses, they are not merely wine doilies, pink and blushing. A world of roses exists beyond cheap insipid blends and candy-sweet white zinfandels. Made properly, roses are among the world's most refreshing summer wines, excellent with food and, if not conventionally masculine, at least highly romantic.</p>
        <p>Like fathers, roses come in every variety. Roses are made from all sorts of grapes and range in color from pale salmon pink to scarlet. Some are bone-dry and steely, others are lightly sweet. Sparkling roses can be delightful and cheap -- or profound and expensive, like the excellent rose Champagne from Laurent-Perrier for $60 a bottle.</p>
        <p>Roses are most commonly associated with Anjou, Tavel and Bandol, in France, but I've found many of these wines to be overpriced and not that good. Much better values can be found in other areas, from Sicily and southern Italy, to Burgundy and the little-known region of Bugey in eastern France, to Spain, Long Island and California.</p>
        <p>Red grapes are used to make most roses. After the grapes are crushed, the juice is left in contact with the skins just long enough to develop a little color. Then the skins are removed. The removal of the skins, which provide tannin and structure as well as color, accounts for the light-bodied youthfulness of most roses, which should be drunk young. Rose Champagne is an exception, made most often by blending white and red wines, though occasionally, as with Laurent-Perrier, by the same method as still roses.</p>
        <p>Roses naturally match up well with light-bodied foods, so if you're feeding Dad the predictable thick steak, save the rose for another time. But for lighter fish, poultry or pork dishes, break it out. It's a bottle he'll remember.</p>
        <p>RENE BOUVIER, BURGUNDY, MARSANNAY ROSE, EN CHAMPFOREY 1998 -- $15.50  Pink and fragrant, sweetly flavorful with a dry, minerally finish.</p>
        <p>MAS DE GOURGONNIER, LES BAUX DE PROVENCE 1999 -- $13  Maraschino color, floral and mineral aromas, earthy and delicious.</p>
        <p>ILLUMINATI, CAMPIROSA, MONTEPULCIANO D'ABRUZZO CERASUOLO 1998 -- $10  Cherry red, dry with some fruity heft and a nice finish.</p>
        <p>BONNY DOON, VIN GRIS DE CIGARE, CALIFORNIA 1998 -- $9  Rouge, with aromas of strawberry and cassis.</p>
        <p>WOLFFER, THE HAMPTONS, LONG ISLAND 1999 -- $10.50  Pale salmon color, lightly fruity aroma, dry and refreshing.</p>
        <p>ALAIN RENARDAT-FACHE, VIN DU BUGEY, CERDON,  METHODE ANCESTRALE, NONVINTAGE -- $16</p>
        <p>Lightly sweet sparkling wine, and only 7.5 percent alcohol.  Listed in order of preference. Prices are those paid in various Manhattan wine shops.</p>
