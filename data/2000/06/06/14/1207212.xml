        <p>The tall, pleated white toque, once the sartorial symbol of the professional chef, has become as rare in New York restaurant kitchens as summery straw boaters are on city streets.</p>
        <p>The toque was designed to keep hair neatly tucked up and the head cool. (Most are open at the top.) The decline in its popularity reflects generational differences. In the old days, chefs like Andre Soltner of Lutece would not have dreamed of shedding the toque on the job. But in many kitchens today you can easily tell who the top chef is: the one with no hat.</p>
        <p>Chefs like Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Daniel Boulud and Eric Ripert, who do more managing than actual cooking, go toqueless, yet say they try to make their cooks wear them, despite complaints that the tall hats bump into exhaust vents over stoves. ''Maybe when we're past 50 and begin to lose our hair, we'll start wearing toques,'' Mr. Boulud said.</p>
        <p>The younger contingent has lots of other options. The latest is bandanna style, like the headgear worn by Kevin Roth, executive chef at Coup, above right; it can be tied in front or in back.</p>
        <p>A Chicago company, Chefwear, now sells a bandanna cap, which it calls a Dew Wrap, in its catalog. The wrap complies with the New York City Health Code, which requires ''an effective hair restraint'' for people working with food.</p>
        <p>But ponytail holders, even Mario Batali's, don't count.</p>
