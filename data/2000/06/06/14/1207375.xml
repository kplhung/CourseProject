        <p>George Steinbrenner marched resolutely through the corridors of Yankee Stadium last night, barking orders to a club official who accompanied him, sounding impatient. It was too late for Sammy Sosa or Juan Gonzalez to rescue the Yankees from another loss to the Boston Red Sox.</p>
        <p>He boarded an elevator, facing reporters who ask the same question Steinbrenner launches at his baseball executives: do the Yankees need to make changes, a trade, a move to improve? ''We better do something,'' he said. ''Don't you think?''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner's impulse to act must have been fueled by what he saw: the missed opportunities for runs in the early innings; the aggressive play of the new Boston center fielder, Carl Everett; the two-run homer Jason Varitek slugged against Orlando Hernandez to break a sixth-inning tie. With a 5-3 victory, Boston is percentage points behind the Yankees for first place in the American League East, and today Pedro Martinez (9-2) will pitch against Roger Clemens (4-6).</p>
        <p>The weekend series against the Mets was for the fans, Yankees Manager Joe Torre said before last night's game, but the games between the Yankees and the Red Sox are different. ''This is for October,'' Torre said. ''Every game sends a message in the standings.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees and the Red Sox had a respectful relationship last year; they competed hard but without any nastiness, like a pickup basketball game between friends on a Saturday morning. But Everett has brought an edge to the rivalry, stating freely that he detests the Yankees for the way he thought he was treated when he was in their organization, seemingly challenging them in almost everything he does on the field.</p>
        <p>Everett was on first base in the second inning when Troy O'Leary chopped a grounder toward third baseman Scott Brosius, and he charged for second, intent on breaking up the double play. Second baseman Chuck Knoblauch was wary of Everett, taking the throw from Brosius and then fleeing the bag while throwing to first, but Everett got Knoblauch anyway, going past second to knock him down. A clean play, Knoblauch thought; a tough play, in Torre's mind. An unusual play, in what had been a polite rivalry. O'Leary beat Knoblauch's weakened throw to first.</p>
        <p>At the plate, Everett stands with his front foot perhaps two inches from the plate, daring pitchers to throw inside. When the Red Sox and the Yankees played for the first time this year, on May 26, Everett positioned himself extraordinarily shallow -- more shallow, some Yankee veterans thought, than they had seen any center fielder play in Yankee Stadium --  and challenged the Yankees to drive the ball over his head.</p>
        <p>Wendell Kim, the Red Sox coach, counseled Everett to move back just a bit, but the panache remains. Everett is the only significant difference in the Red Sox and Yankee rosters since last year, carrying that attitude, and he made a difference last night. ''He plays hard all the time,'' Boston Manager Jimy Williams said. ''He loves to play baseball.''</p>
        <p>Two batters after Everett affected Knoblauch's throw, Wilton Veras singled home O'Leary, and when the Red Sox scored two runs in the third, Everett contributed the hinge in the rally, a long triple over the head of center fielder Bernie Williams.</p>
        <p>The Yankees scored three runs early, as well, against the Boston starter Brian Rose, who worked deliberately and required constant counsel from Varitek, his catcher. But the Boston manager tired of watching Rose's cautious style and relieved him with the bases loaded and one out in the third; fans jeered Rose as he departed, and he tipped his hat sarcastically, glaring into the stands.</p>
        <p>Hipolito Pichardo (1-0), another of Boston's continual reclamation projects, came on and got Shane Spencer -- who rarely hits grounders -- to bounce into a 4-6-3 double play to end the inning. It was the key pitch in the game, Jimy Williams said.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had the leadoff man on in the fourth and couldn't score, and had two runners on in the fifth and couldn't score. Everett opened the top of the sixth and bounced a grounder past Hernandez, and when the ball skipped off the second-base bag into short center field, Everett sped around first and wheeled into second.</p>
        <p>Everett took third when Brian Daubach grounded to second, Knoblauch making a nice play. Ricky Ledee -- who had been guilty of two poor plays in left field innings -- ran down a blooper over third base, forcing Everett to hold at third.</p>
        <p>There were two outs, and Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, jogged to the mound and gave Hernandez (6-5) the option of pitching around Varitek, a left-handed hitter, who was hitless in nine previous at-bats against El Duque. Veras, a right-handed hitter, was on deck.</p>
        <p>But Hernandez attacked Varitek, going ahead in the count 1-2. At 2-2, Hernandez tried spinning a breaking ball over the outside corner and it was called a ball. Catcher Jorge Posada set his target over the inside corner, Hernandez fired a fastball that drifted over the middle of the plate, and Varitek whacked it into the upper deck in right field, his first home run since April 26 giving Boston a 5-3 lead.</p>
        <p>''The object was not to give him something good to hit,'' Hernandez said. ''The last pitch was the only good pitch.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch reached base in the ninth, bringing the tying run to the plate, but Paul O'Neill lifted a harmless fly ball. Everett drifted underneath and ended the game, as Steinbrenner made his way to the Yankees' clubhouse, coping with impulses.</p>
