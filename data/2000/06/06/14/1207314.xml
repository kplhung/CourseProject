        <p>One day perhaps, New Yorkers will regale their grandchildren with tales of a vanished urban hardship: the long, excruciating elevator ride to the top of a skyscraper. They will explain how they had to stand elbow to elbow, facing the door and avoiding eye contact, with little to do but watch the floor numbers change or study the tops of their shoes -- all the while missing breaking news bulletins and important messages from advertisers.</p>
        <p>That is all changing.</p>
        <p>In what sometimes seems like a campaign to ensure that not one square inch of public space lacks advertising, several companies have recently signed deals to outfit office elevators in New York and across the country with silent, flat-panel video screens that show advertising and news via the Internet.</p>
        <p>A few buildings in New York have the screens now -- for example, Worldwide Plaza at Eighth Avenue and 50th Street, and the Park Avenue Tower at 55th Street -- but dozens more will have them by year's end.</p>
        <p>The developers of two popular systems say they are a desirable amenity for people who are packed uncomfortably close to each other. ''People on elevators have their personal space invaded,'' said Peter J. Irwin, president of Elevator News Network, a Toronto company that expects to begin operations in New York within a few weeks. ''We think this is a pleasant diversion for people during long rides on crowded elevators.''</p>
        <p>And Michael DiFranza, the president of Captivate Network, which operates the screens at Worldwide Plaza and Park Avenue Tower, said, ''People don't want cars without radios, and once they become accustomed to it, people will not want to ride in elevators without this capability.''</p>
        <p>The screens are similar to those that have been popping up at supermarket checkout lines, gasoline pumps and just about any place where consumers have to stand still.  But officials of both ENN and Captivate say their systems are intended to appeal to people working in high-rise office buildings, a captive audience that tends to be highly educated and earn more than $90,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Both systems use the top of the screens to display sports scores, weather, traffic reports, financial news and other headlines. ENN uses news from wire services like Reuters and The Associated Press, and plans to set up a New York newsroom with a journalist to cover local stories. Captivate has deals with the Internet arms of newspapers like The New York Times, The Boston Globe and The Chicago Tribune. The lower one-third or one-quarter of the screens are reserved for the advertising that pays for the system.</p>
        <p>The building owners receive as much as 10 percent of the advertising revenue, which could be substantial. A Captivate official said individual advertisers could expect to pay thousands of dollars a month for ads that appear every 15 minutes during working hours.</p>
        <p>With the prospect of a steady stream of income, some of the biggest landlords in the nation have reached agreements with the companies. Captivate said it had deals with Equity Office Properties, the largest office real estate investment trust in the nation, plus Boston Properties, Vornado Realty Trust, Reckson Associates Realty and Jack Resnick &amp; Sons. ENN said it had signed up Tishman Speyer Properties, which manages both Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building, as well as the Witkoff Group, Angelo, Gordon &amp; Company and partnerships managed by Wien &amp; Malkin.</p>
        <p>Together these companies own or manage hundreds of millions of square feet of property that are equipped with thousands of elevators.</p>
        <p>''I think this is going to be a big development,'' said Philip M. Waterman, senior vice president for Reckson's Manhattan properties, which include buildings at 919 Third Avenue, 1350 Avenue of the Americas and 100 Wall Street. ''Think about the number of minutes a year we spend on elevators.''</p>
        <p>The typical elevator ride lasts 45 seconds to a minute, the two companies estimate, and office workers typically make five elevator trips a day.</p>
        <p>The elevator news companies use somewhat different technologies. ENN sends its feed to server computers in each building, which are connected by cables to the screens in the elevators. Mr. Irwin said experience in Canada showed that it was difficult to maintain computers mounted in the elevator cabs because of fluctuations in electric power, uneven temperatures and dirt.  ''You have to take the elevator out of service to repair the computer,'' he said, ''and building managers try to minimize elevator downtime.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. DiFranza, whose company is based in the Boston suburb of Westford, Mass., said Captivate's solid-state computers were working fine in elevator cabs. The Internet connection is wireless, which is less expensive than hanging cables, he said.</p>
        <p>Captivate has been operating screens in 17 of 24 elevators at Worldwide Plaza since November. The 12-inch high-resolution color screens, located to the side of the door above the floor buttons, are unobtrusive and match the decor. Shelly Martin, 32, an assistant accounts manager, said she usually glanced at the news and weather on her way to and from the 10th floor, a ride she makes many times a day. ''It makes the ride more interesting,'' she said. ''I now look forward to the elevator ride.''</p>
        <p>While Ms. Martin's remarks might be Muzak to the ears of Captivate officials, she seemed to be the exception yesterday. On several trips up and down, most riders on a full elevator did not glance at the screen but kept their eyes focused on the floor or the backs of other people's heads. Some workers interviewed after they got off were only vaguely aware of the new screens. None could recall any ads.</p>
        <p>Nor has anyone bothered to complain. Richard T. O'Donnell, the director of security at Worldwide Plaza, said the building could announce fire drills or emergencies over the system, although it has not used that function yet.</p>
        <p>Both companies offer that kind of service, and they make some other novel pitches, too. For example, ENN's Web site says that as local restaurants turn to elevator ads, they will be less likely to litter building lobbies with menus.</p>
