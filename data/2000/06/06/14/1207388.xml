        <p>GODDARD-Ruth R. The American Jewish Committee bids a sorrowful farewell to an extraordinary woman who graced our organization with her generosity, elegance, friendship and vitality for more than half a century. Ruth served as Chair of our Women's Campaign Board and, in 1968, became the first woman elected to serve as an AJC National Vice President. Most recently, she was Honorary Chair of The Women's Campaign Board and Honorary National Vice President. A woman well ahead of her time, Ruth combined a successful and varied business career with active leadership in a host of philanthropic and civic agencies devoted to the the arts, health care and education. Particularly close to her heart was the well-being of the Jewish community, to which she devoted much of her time and energy. In 1996, AJC was proud to pay tribute to Ruth at a gala dinner held in honor of her 95th birthday. Ruth was a trendsetter and a uniquely energetic individual, whose legacy of public service, humanitarianism and Jewish committment we will long treasure. Bruce M. Ramer, President David A. Harris, Exec. Director Jack Lapin, Chair, Board of Governors Shulamith Bahat, Assoc Exec Dir</p>
        <p>GODDARD-Ruth R. The Women's Campaign Board of the American Jewish Committee is deeply saddened by the death of our Honorary Chairman, friend, benefactor and mentor, who, for more than 50 years, worked tirelessly to support the critical programs and initiatives of this organization that meant so much to her. A former Chairman and one of our most respected and active leaders, we are grateful for the time we had to benefit from her wisdom, experience and indomitable spirit. Stephanie Saft, Chairman</p>
