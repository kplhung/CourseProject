        <p>The demand for corporate bonds denominated in yen has exploded this year, a result of some far-reaching changes that have helped make the Japanese economy less insular.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. was the latest company to tap the market here today, selling 140 billion yen, or $1.31 billion at current exchange rates, of so-called Samurai bonds and setting a record for corporate fund-raising in yen by a foreign company.</p>
        <p>Three weeks ago, the financing arm of the Xerox Corporation sold 130 billion yen of Samurai bonds, following companies like Fiat and countries like Argentina. General Motors, Ford, McDonald's and Deutsche Telekom have also sold yen-denominated bonds this year, although their debt issues were sold outside Japan.</p>
        <p>''There's been an explosion this year in yen-denominated issues,'' said Jack Gunn, head of the Tokyo debt-syndicate desk at Merrill Lynch, currently the world's largest seller of yen-denominated bonds. Merrill and Daiwa Securities were the lead underwriters for the Samurai bonds I.B.M. issued today.</p>
        <p>So far this year, almost five trillion yen worth of the bonds have been sold, or $46.7 billion, compared with less than three trillion yen last year, according to Merrill, and the factors driving the market speak volumes about how Japan is changing. The boom tells a story about increased foreign investment in Japan, as well as about how extensive corporate restructuring has been here.</p>
        <p>As high-interest deposits in Japan's huge government-run postal savings system mature over the next two years, some 100 trillion yen will be seeking a new home. And the Japanese savers will be seeking better returns than bank accounts and government bonds, which offer little in the way of return given the central bank's policy of maintaining virtually zero interest rates to stimulate economic growth.</p>
        <p>Yen-denominated bonds appeal to these prospective investors' concerns about foreign-exchange and credit risks. I.B.M.'s bonds mature in two years, reducing the risk of a rise in interest rates, and pay a coupon of 0.62 percent, or 21.5 basis points better than Japanese government bonds of similar maturities. (One hundred basis points are equal to 1 percent.)</p>
        <p>And I.B.M., unlike some Japanese businesses, presents relatively little credit risk.</p>
        <p>Those terms also explain why raising money here is far more attractive for corporations, which would have to pay a much higher interest rate if they sold bonds in the United States or Europe. Borrowers seeking to capitalize on Japan's low interest rates can issue bonds in yen and use derivative securities known as currency swaps to turn the yen they raise into dollars or euros.</p>
        <p>Moreover, as foreign investment here increases, the need for foreign companies to finance their activities in Japan also rises. For instance, Boehringer Ingelheim, a German drug manufacturer that recently acquired a controlling stake in SS Pharmaceutical of Japan, presumably does more business in yen now than it has in the past.</p>
        <p>Imports are also rising, which increases the demand for yen to pay for them.</p>
        <p>''Part of this is the internationalization of the yen, which is a result of the fact that the Japanese economy is opening up at a faster pace now,'' Mr. Gunn of Merrill Lynch said.</p>
