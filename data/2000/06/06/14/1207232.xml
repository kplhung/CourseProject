        <p>Elephant Airs</p>
        <p>Babar and Celeste are off on an adventure. Beginning at 7:30 tonight, the beloved elephant and his wife will star in the New York premiere of an hourlong musical, ''The Travels of Babar: An Adventure in Scales,'' at Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street in Manhattan. Narrated by Anne Jackson and Eli Wallach and using digital slides of more than 250 images from the original illustrations by the author, Jean de Brunhoff (1899-1937), this musical, composed and directed by Raphael Mostel, consists of 46 episodes relating the honeymoon adventures of the elephant king and queen. With Paul Hostetter leading an eight-piece orchestra, the show plays nine performances though Monday, the last narrated in French by Laurent de Brunhoff, the author's son.</p>
        <p>Hero's Return</p>
        <p>After three years of restoration, a masterpiece of Renaissance art, Benvenuto Cellini's bronze statue of Perseus, is to return to its site in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence on June 23. The statue, created between 1544 and 1554 for Cosimo de' Medici, depicts the hero of ancient Greek mythology holding high the head of the slain Medusa. The statue, which stood on one side of the Piazza della Signoria in the center of the city, was removed in December 1996 after the discovery of serious corrosion. When the statue is restored to the Loggia, its richly decorated but fragile marble base will be kept in a museum and replaced by a copy.</p>
        <p>Legacy</p>
        <p>Soon after George Eastman House opened in Rochester in 1951, its curator sought to acquire the work of Alfred Stieglitz (1864-1946), who gained international stature as a proponent of photography as fine art. With the cooperation of Georgia O'Keeffe, Stieglitz's wife, artistic collaborator and subject, George Eastman House gathered photographs, correspondence and other material that form the core of its extensive Stieglitz collection. On Saturday 110 works from this collection, from the 1890's to 1935, will go on view and run through Aug. 13 in ''The Photography of Alfred Stieglitz: Georgia O'Keeffe's Enduring Legacy.''</p>
        <p>By the Waters</p>
        <p>The music includes blues, bluegrass, Cajun, Celtic, folk, reggae and rock. There will be dance and theater, storytelling and singalongs, too, not to overlook jugglers and giant puppets. This annual environmental music festival, on Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to dusk in Croton Point Park in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., is Clearwater's Great Hudson River Revival 2000, whose goal extends beyond fun and food to educating the public to the need to clean up the Hudson River. The festival, with Westchester County as a sponsor, includes nature displays and instructional sessions, and it will feature performances by Josh White Jr., Janis Ian, Holly Near, Ubaka Hill and Ray Wylie Hubbard, among others.</p>
