        <p>During a 40-minute limousine ride into the North Korean capital from Pyongyang's airport on Tuesday, the leaders of North and South Korea, who had never met before, had this extraordinary exchange:</p>
        <p>''June 13 will be a day recorded in history,'' the reclusive North Korean president, Kim Jong Il, said to his southern counterpart after they arrived together at his state guesthouse. ''Let's get on,'' replied Kim Dae Jung, ''and make that history.''</p>
        <p>Then, in words that managed to be both hopeful and enigmatic, the northern leader, in only his second known meeting with another head of state after six years in power, said, ''I will try not to be too proud, and you will not be disappointed.''</p>
        <p>The dialogue was reported by South Korean journalists traveling with their president, who were told of it by a government official.</p>
        <p>In fact, disappointment appeared to be far from the spirit of either man at the start of a summit meeting whose opening formalities seemed surprisingly relaxed, exceeding the expectations of many people, including perhaps those of the principals themselves.</p>
        <p>Indeed, whether reviewing goose-stepping northern troops or chatting easily with his cherubic junior, there was the 75-year-old South Korean leader, barely able to suppress his pleasure at realizing a cherished wish of setting foot in the north.</p>
        <p>The triumph of restoring dialogue across the world's most heavily armed border will certainly seal the place of Kim Dae Jung, already a heroic champion of democracy in his country, as a huge force for change in modern Korean history.</p>
        <p>During the meeting on Tuesday, the two leaders discussed setting up a hotline. ''From now on, let's directly contact each other,'' Kim Jong Il was reported to have said.</p>
        <p>The talks today are expected to be the first to deal in depth with problems that divide the two countries. One topic brought up today was the possibility of setting up representatives offices in each country, according to pool reports from Pyongyang.</p>
        <p>In South Korea, where the meeting was banner news and was broadcast and rebroadcast in schools, offices and on the huge television screens displayed from many buildings in central Seoul, people clapped, gasped and even cried at the sight of the two Kims shaking hands.</p>
        <p>''When I saw the two leaders greet each other, my heart raced with excitement,'' a 38-year-old woman told The Korea Herald. ''At that moment, I was convinced that even if reunification doesn't happen right away, we may see it happen in the near future.''</p>
        <p>North Korea's state-controlled media were more subdued, but by its unusual standards, extraordinarily positive about engagement with the south. ''The Great Leader Kim Jong Il warmly greeted President Kim Dae Jung at the airport,'' Radio Pyongyang announced. Later it reported that the meeting represented ''a landmark turning point in the road toward national reconciliation, cooperation, peace and unification.''</p>
        <p>The South Korean president is now expected to press for an easing by northern officials of the harsh restrictions on communications and travel that prevent the estimated 1.8 million survivors of the 1950-53 war with relatives in the north from making contact with their families.</p>
        <p>After inheriting power from his Communist father and presiding over his nation's worst economic catastrophe, the little-known Kim Jong Il, meanwhile, has sealed his emergence from the shadows by confidently acting as a host to his elder guest at a summit meeting that seemed largely conducted according to his vague and secretive terms.</p>
        <p>The younger leader's expression  as he reviewed the troops upon Mr. Kim's arrival, balancing his slightly visible paunch on his elevated heels,  was one of satisfaction that comes from success at gamesmanship with missiles and rumors about nuclear weapons that brought an erstwhile enemy to town bearing lavish gifts.</p>
        <p>As an inducement for the famine-stricken and impoverished north, the South Korean government pledged large quantities of fertilizer to Pyongyang when they first agreed to the summit meeting after secret negotiations in China last April. Providing a further lubricant, the South Korean leader traveled with heads of his country's biggest conglomerates, all eager for a foothold in the north.</p>
        <p>In another enigmatic comment by the host, Mr. Kim told the South Korean president: ''The world is closely watching us. Why President Kim came to North Korea and why I accepted is a question mark. We have to give the answer to this question during the two nights and three days, and I ask not only President Kim but also ministers to make contributions to this.''</p>
        <p>Enigma has long been a trademark of North Korean leaders, starting with the country's founder, Kim Il Sung, who combined Stalinism with almost cult-like leader worship in four decades of power.</p>
        <p>The event on Tuesday confirmed that the founder's son also relishes surprise. ''Today was a demonstration of Kim Jong Il's new ruling style,'' said Dr. Yu Suk Ryul at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. ''In the recent past, he paid a surprise visit to the Chinese Embassy in Pyongyang. During a previous visit by Chung Ju Yung, the honorary chairman of the Hyundai Group, Kim paid a surprise courtesy call to the Baekhwawon State Guest House where he was staying in Pyongyang. Looking at such actions, it makes sense that Kim Jong Il came out to personally greet President Kim Dae Jung.''</p>
        <p>Before taking off from Seoul on Tuesday morning, in a final comment that betrayed his wariness about the north, the South Korean leader told his nation to pray for his safe return.</p>
        <p>Moments earlier, in his departure speech, he said that he would work on ''the easy things'' with his counterpart, seeking momentum-building accomplishments, instead of great leaps forward on security issues and other sticky questions.</p>
        <p>In that spirit, the first day was indeed heavy on ceremony and short on detail, at least announced details. After their surprising ride together to the state guest house, past hundreds of thousands of North Koreans who mostly chanted their own leader's name and waved colorful fronds, the two presidents met together for 27 minutes.</p>
        <p>Their meeting was followed by a lunch at which the head of the North Korean Workers' Party acted as host. Then, after a traditional dance performance, and more rubbing of elbows by the two delegations, there was an evening banquet.</p>
        <p>At the insistence of the northern organizers, the talks lack a formal agenda, and even the schedule of events has been kept a closely held secret. In addition to the car ride together on Tuesday and the brief meeting afterward, the two leaders were expected to meet by themelves one more time, and to attend a  gathering of the two delegations.</p>
        <p>Kim Dae Jung is expected to return to Seoul by motorcade by crossing at the the heavily guarded border village of Panmunjom. ''The threshold of success for this summit meeting was a picture of the two men together, some material goods for the north for Kim Jong Il to show off, and some news for Kim Dae Jung to bring home about separated families,'' said Marcus Noland, a North Korea expert at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Noland said that most of this agenda had been quickly achieved in the first hours of the day, but that the family issue will prove much harder to resolve because reunification threatens the ideological purity of North Koreans, who live under constant indoctrination.</p>
        <p>But in his remarks at the evening banquet, Kim Dae Jung persisted with his dream of untrammeled contact, even proposing the re-opening of road and rail links after more than a half-century of barbed wires, heavily armed border guards and frequent defections.</p>
        <p>''When that happens,'' Mr. Kim said ''all Koreans will be able to travel freely between the two sides and work toward reconciliation, cooperation and eventual reunification.''</p>

        <p>Praise From World Leaders</p>
        <p>(By Reuters) -- The first summit meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea brought praise yesterday from the United Nations, the United States, Russia and other nations.</p>
        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations said he hoped the meeting marked ''the beginning of a new era of mutual trust.''</p>
