        <p>As more women came forward yesterday with harrowing accounts of violence in Central Park in the hours after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on Sunday, the Police Department began investigating whether its officers had responded adequately as rude public behavior descended into mob rule and sexual attacks.</p>
        <p>The authorities said that 22 people had  reported being attacked by groups of frenzied young men. Five of the victims also said they were robbed.</p>
        <p>The reports included complaints from at least two victims that officers had not helped them after they were attacked, a matter that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said was being investigated by the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau. The mayor said that he was troubled by the reports of the officers' nonchalance, and  that if Internal Affairs investigators verified the accounts, ''those officers should be severely disciplined.''</p>
        <p>The investigation began as witnesses and victims provided detailed accounts of milling packs of men who heckled, chased and, in some cases, groped nearly every woman they encountered during a frightening few hours in the southeast corner of Central Park. Taken together, the accounts portrayed a scene far worse than that initially described by the authorities, including Police Commissioner Howard Safir, who on Monday said the attacks were ''an isolated incident.''</p>
        <p>One of the victims who came forward yesterday was a 14-year-old girl who told the police that she was leaving the park at about 6 p.m. when a crowd of men tore off her top and snatched a chain from her neck. Another was an editorial director of a Chicago-based Web site who said she was in New York on business and was set upon by dozens of screaming men during an evening stroll. The victim, Pam Abrams, 42, was able to evade her pursuers, she said, by climbing over the thick stone wall at the park's edge.</p>
        <p>''I felt like I was crushed, because people came at me from all sides, from the left, the back and in front of me,'' said Ms. Abrams, who contacted reporters yesterday. ''I remember people screaming, 'Yeah! Yeah! Get her!' ''</p>
        <p>The new accounts also raised questions that went beyond how the police had handled the victims who reported the crimes, to whether the police had taken adequate steps to prevent the violence. One witness, Paul Klenk, 36, an administrative assistant at a Manhattan hedge fund, said he was riding his bike on the eastern side of the park between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m., roughly two hours before the most serious attacks were reported, and saw roaming groups of men harassing young women in plain view of the police.</p>
        <p>''What I saw was very regular, kind of persistent behavior of young guys grabbing women right and left at every chance they could,'' he said. ''The police were lined up, just standing with their arms crossed and kind of blankly staring. They didn't do a thing. They didn't try to interact. They were basically on the sideline, kind of frozen.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Klenk and the mother of a 16-year-old victim questioned whether the police presence was adequately forceful. The victim's mother said her daughter and an 18-year-old friend were the first victims known to be assaulted, and if the police had stepped in, the crowd's bizarre mood  might have been defused. ''They might have been able to stop the others from happening,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But the authorities said that 4,000 officers -- nearly 10 percent of the department -- had been assigned to crowd control at the parade, which was attended by as many as one million people. Few of those officers had been assigned to the southeastern corner of the park, where most of the assaults were reported, because there had been no history of incidents in that area during previous parades.</p>
        <p>''This is not a police department that was asleep that day,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''Sometimes, some sick, crazy, criminal or drunk kids do sick things.''</p>
        <p>Confronted with a blizzard of details, some of them contradictory, the police began trying to identify more attackers while evaluating their own response.</p>
        <p>About 40 detectives were reviewing four videotapes of the incident recorded by people in the park. One of the victims identified her assailant from the tapes last night, the authorities said. The image, converted to a still picture, was being compared against a computerized databank of known criminals.</p>
        <p>Other victims were being brought in to review the tapes last night, and the police were making additional still images of people committing assaults. ''We're probably going to get a couple of hundred photos off of those tapes,'' one investigator said.</p>
        <p>Last night, detectives were questioning five people who may have participated in the violence or witnessed some of the attacks, officials said. Investigators said they hoped to release a photograph of an additional suspect today.</p>
        <p>Internal Affairs officers, according to a person involved in the inquiry, were questioning a sergeant who was at the 17th Precinct station house on East 51st Street on Sunday evening. One of the victims, Peyton Bryant, 29, said she went there and tried, unsuccessfully, to report being attacked.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Commissioner Safir said, investigators would be showing the victims photographs of police officers who were on duty in the area Sunday evening.</p>
        <p>One official said it was still unclear whether any officers had failed to take proper action, but noted that such neglect could warrant their dismissal. ''These people were victims of a sex crime,'' the investigator said. ''How can someone slough that off?''</p>
        <p>The official was quick to point out, however, that the investigation had just begun and that several of the victims praised the police who came to their aid shortly after the attacks.  The husband of a French woman who was one of the victims told The Associated Press that he and his wife ran to a police officer after the attack. ''He took us in his car to protect us from the crowd,'' said the man, who did not want his name or his wife's to be used.</p>
        <p>Confusion remained over the course of the assaults and when the first police units arrived. Mr. Safir said that 10 scooters pulled into that area of the park after an officer radioed for assistance at 6:06 p.m. and that he believed the incidents were over at that point. But the criminal complaint for one of the assaults said that it had not occurred until 22 minutes later.</p>
        <p>As the police sought to identify other suspects, two men were arraigned yesterday in Manhattan Criminal Court for what prosecutors described as their roles in an attack on a 19-year-old British tourist.</p>
        <p>Dave Rowe, 24, of Lefrak City, Queens, and Tremayne Bain, 23, of Brooklyn, were arrested Sunday evening in the park. Both were charged with two counts of second-degree aggravated sexual abuse and one count each of first-degree sexual abuse and second-degree robbery. The men were held on $10,000 bail.</p>
        <p>Their lawyers said the men had not participated in the attacks and had been taken into custody during the ensuing confusion. ''Obviously, it's a very traumatic experience for the woman, which calls into question the identification,'' said Gordon Ludwig, Mr. Bain's lawyer. ''The sheer number of people and the nature of the melee itself would make the ID questionable under the best of circumstances.''</p>
        <p>Several friends who were with the two men during and after the parade have given statements to the police supporting their version of events.</p>
        <p>One of the friends, Hasan Perez, 23, a social worker in East Harlem who recently received a master's degree from Columbia University, said yesterday that the two accused men were part of group that met on late Sunday afternoon on the Avenue of the Americas between 58th Street and Central Park South.</p>
        <p>It was a loose group of about a dozen men, some of whom barely knew each other and others who have known each other since childhood, Mr. Perez said.</p>
        <p>The group had gathered on some nearby benches when they noticed a mob of several hundred men inside the park hooting and spraying water, he said. His group -- including Mr. Bain and Mr. Rowe -- decided to leave the area after several women emerged from the mob in tears and soaking wet. ''We knew it wouldn't be long before cops would show up,'' Mr. Perez said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perez said the friends went into another part of the park and spent 30 to 40 minutes on some rocks overlooking the pond, then retraced their route. As they made their way on Central Park South toward Fifth Avenue, he said, they noticed a woman talking to police officers and pointing in their direction.</p>
        <p>Officers then approached Mr. Bain, ordered him to stop and searched him, Mr. Perez said. Soon after that they arrested Mr. Rowe as well.</p>
        <p>''The wrong people were locked up,'' Mr. Perez said. ''Yes, it was a wolf pack, but it wasn't Tremayne Bain and it wasn't David Rowe.''</p>
        <p>Prosecutors, in a complaint sworn to by Detective Jenny Mami of the Central Park Precinct, charged that the two men were part of a group that surrounded the teenager, ''pulled her shorts down partially, ripped her shirt, grabbed her breasts'' and sexually abused her before snatching her purse.</p>
