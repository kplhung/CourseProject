        <p>Valery Kamensky is there for the taking. So are John MacLean, Kevin Stevens, Mathieu Schneider, Kevin Hatcher, Rich Pilon, and Alexandre Daigle. But the most significant player the Rangers could lose in the June 23 expansion draft is Kirk McLean, who right now is expected to start the season as the team's No. 1 goaltender until Mike Richter's surgically repaired knee is healed.</p>
        <p>''I don't particularly want to lose anybody,'' Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager, said yesterday, after the National Hockey League disclosed the protected lists of the 28 teams that the Columbus Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild will choose from next week.</p>
        <p>No team can lose more than two players in the draft, and teams can protect players who will become unrestricted free agents on July 1. The lure of drafting such unprotected free agents, the category that Stevens, Schneider, Hatcher and Daigle fall under, is that the expansion teams could receive compensatory draft picks in return if the free agent signs with another team.</p>
        <p>The lure of a player like McLean, who will make $950,000 next season, is that he could be a starting goaltender on a fair amount of teams.</p>
        <p>''There's a chance Kirk could go,'' Sather said. ''But at some point in time, the organization has to get younger. And we have to do some things to make that happen.''</p>
        <p>One of the first orders of business for Sather is to hire a new coach. John Paddock, who coached the Rangers' Hartford affiliate to the American Hockey League championship this season, and Walt Kyle, the head coach of Edmonton's A.H.L. affiliate in Hamilton, appear to be the leading candidates for the job.</p>
        <p>''As I said when I was hired, I will try and get this done before the draft,'' Sather said yesterday in a conference call. ''But that may or may not happen.''</p>
        <p>Still, Sather, who assumed control of hockey operations on June 1, has said all the right things. After three playoff-less seasons, and many more of being chastised for their obsession with signing over-the-hill veterans, the Rangers, Sather promised, are in for a shake-up.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to send a wake-up call to the team,'' Sather said. ''If you're not prepared to work, there is not going to be room for those guys on the team to ride along. It's not a retirement process here.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps. But Sather could inaugurate his tenure in early July by bringing Mark Messier back to New York, where he could retire in peace after another season or two. Messier, perhaps the most prominent player not protected, has already been told by the Vancouver Canucks that they will not pick up the option on his contract for next season.</p>
        <p>It would cost them $6 million next season, and then another $1 million the following season to buy the 39-year-old Messier out of the last option season on the contract that Messier signed in the summer of 1997, when he left the Rangers in a messy divorce.</p>
        <p>It is doubtful that either Columbus or Minnesota will pick Messier and then pay him either $6 million this season or $2 million to buy him out. It is also unlikely that either will bet on Kamensky, the underproductive left wing the Rangers signed to a four-year, $17 million deal before last season.</p>
        <p>Putting Kamensky on the unprotected list, therefore, was ''a little bit of a wake-up call,'' Sather said. And no one, Sather warned, should be feeling comfortable. ''There isn't anybody untouchable,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sather did concede that there was not much he could do with players who have no-trade clauses, such as Theo Fleury. ''Having a no-trade, no-cut, no-yell-at contract is a little bit different,'' Sather said, with a laugh.</p>
        <p>Four Islanders Available</p>
        <p>If anybody needed proof that the Islanders' roster is the youngest in the league, one look at their expansion eligibles is sufficient proof. The Islanders have only four unprotected players on their roster. Any player who has played two full seasons or less is exempt from the expansion draft. And the Islanders had to acquire defenseman Ian Herbers from Anaheim late in the season because teams have to have at least one player available at every position, and the Islanders did not have any defensemen who qualified.</p>
