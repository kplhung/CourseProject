        <p>WHEN the smiling young man boards the elevator outside the president's office at the Ford Foundation, he taps the stack of grants cradled in his arms and can't suppress a boast: ''There's $14.5 million here,'' he says, a bit pixilated by his messenger's role in lots of other people's imminent good fortune. Who can blame him?</p>
        <p>This is the place where they give money away! There's $330 million of it floating around in active donations to New York City alone right this minute. This is the place where the signature of the president, Susan V. Berresford, is better than worth its weight in gold.</p>
        <p>No wonder Ms. Berresford loves signing off on things, especially things that move her like anti-poverty initiatives, affirmative action strategies, and last month's $42.5 million windfall to 28 arts organizations intent on building their endowments for the long haul in our technology-obsessed society.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berresford, who concedes that  a plaintive piece of music can make her cry and a provocative piece of theater like ''Copenhagen'' can make her think deep thoughts for months on end, worries about the arts going the way of the dinosaur unless properly preserved.</p>
        <p>Too, Ms. Berresford had just started at Ford when the first ladies of the feminist movement, Gloria and Bella, swept through and converted the president at the time, McGeorge Bundy, to their cause 30 years back. And she's still committed to it: ''Without affirmative action, I don't see how we're going to get out of being a color-coded society, and I don't see how we're going to break down the glass ceiling.''</p>
        <p>At least the foundation sets a good example. ''All of our billions are managed by a woman, the president is a woman, so this must be a decent place for women to work,'' she asserts.</p>
        <p>First there's the more than decent office -- when you can toss your scarf over a folding screen painted by Marc Chagall, opt for three distinct seating modes from desk to sofa to round table, all with stellar views, pluck refreshments from your own fridge instead of the hallway vending machine, your professional digs connote an environment -- on the 10th floor of the Ford Foundation building, the East Side landmark that doubles as the world's largest glassed-in dish garden. Ms. Berresford adores her address.</p>
        <p>Then there's the mandate that matches the environment: her mission, as first woman president of the $14.6 billion foundation, a nonpartisan no-strings institution that cut its ties to the Ford family and Ford stock decades ago, is to give away at least $1 billion every two years. That's give it away, not pocket it: altruism rules at 320 East 43rd.</p>
        <p>Sounds like an inspired gig, particularly since she's the generous type, the type who was touched by those Depression-era documentaries she watched as a privileged Brearley schoolgirl: ''The people in those films were my heroes and heroines,'' says Ms. Berresford, who latched onto a cause, if not a precise career path, early in life, then concentrated on American history at Vassar and Radcliffe.</p>
        <p>ISSUES of fairness, slavery, poverty, women's rights attracted her; a summer job tending office for Theodore H. White, the chronicler of presidential campaigns, politicized her. A post-college job with the Neighborhood Youth Corps presaged a future of ''practitioner activism'' for this non-flower power child who married during college, divorced and raised a son in her 20's and has lived in Greenwich Village with a city judge, now retired, for more than three decades. Lived with but never married?</p>
        <p>Her half-answer arrives with a blush: ''Well, if it's working, why . . .''</p>
        <p>Seems the top foundation spot was tailored for the 57-year-old Ms. Berresford, whose absence of furrows and frown lines may be traceable to a higher authority than Manhattan's cutting-edge plastic surgeons: cutting-edge philanthropy.</p>
        <p>She calls herself lucky to have a job that lets her nurture the very things she cares deeply about: ''Money doesn't buy leadership or ideas, or create them, but it can support people who are leaders with good ideas and let them test their ideas at increasing levels of scale and significance.''</p>
        <p>But not everyone with a good idea gets a stipend, hence Ms. Berresford's prematurely silver, albeit gamin, cap of hair above her kimono-style (made in Kansas City) jacket. She and her staff of grant-makers field 45,000 requests for financing a year and, intent on not spreading the wealth too thinly, reward 2,000.</p>
        <p>''People think this job makes you feel like Santa Claus, but it doesn't,'' she says. ''In the end of the day, you say no to multiples of people compared to those you say yes to. You can feel guilty you aren't delivering for more people.''</p>
        <p>Does Ms. Berresford harbor any guilt behind those rimless glasses?</p>
        <p>''It happens every day!'' she blurts. Yesterday, it was the Beijing women's coalition at the United Nations. Tomorrow, who knows? That's why the foundation keeps a slush fund for projects that rear up unexpectedly ''and are so fabulous you have to help.''</p>
        <p>Growing up, Ms. Berresford dabbled in all the lessons money could buy: piano, painting, violin, guitar, banjo, voice. But the best ones -- learning to trout fish with her father, a lawyer who died when she was 12 -- were the free ones. She hasn't forgotten.</p>
