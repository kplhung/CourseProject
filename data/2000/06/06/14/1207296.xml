        <p>As Amo Houghton stepped into the shower a couple of months ago, he knew no one could begrudge him retirement.

        <p>As Amo Houghton stepped into the shower a couple of months ago, he knew no one could begrudge him retirement. At 73, he had little left to prove: the former head of a Fortune 500 corporation, a wealthy Brahmin with a social conscience, a moderate congressman of grace with a spiritual bent.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Houghton also knew that if he retired, his absence would make his 31st Congressional District, a rural stretch across upstate New York's Southern Tier, significantly more vulnerable than it already was to being reapportioned out of existence in the next two years.</p>
        <p>What's a patrician multimillionaire to do?</p>
        <p>With shower water beating down upon his white hair, Mr. Houghton decided. He stepped out of the stall, he later recalled, and in his altogether told his wife, Priscilla, that he had some news that would disrupt their plans. He was going to run for an eighth term, which, in the 31st District, pretty much meant he was going to serve an eighth term.</p>
        <p>''We're just going to have to work our life around it,'' Mr. Houghton said later. ''See our children, our grandchildren, and then have our own private time in different ways.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Houghton's choice did not receive the attention of those recently made by Rudolph W. Giuliani to remain the mayor of New York and Representative Rick A. Lazio to run for the Senate. But it has won Republican sighs of relief in Washington, where the party's leaders fret over preserving their paper-thin majority in the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>The decision has also stifled political competition in the district. No Democrat has yet offered to be sacrificed on Election Day. ''It's incumbency and money,'' said Richard Stevenson, the Democratic chairman for Cattaraugus County. Besides, he added, a lot of the would-be opponents ''are friends of Amo.''</p>
        <p>But the friendships and respect earned by Mr. Houghton might not be enough to protect his seat from the mathematics of politics.</p>
        <p>The state's rural districts are continuing to bleed residents. If, as expected, the current census forces the state's political map to be redrawn with two fewer Congressional seats, an obvious casualty would be some old silo of a district: where young people are fleeing, where the population could easily be split between two neighboring districts, where the representative is ready to call it a day.</p>
        <p>Say, a district like the 31st.</p>
        <p>In the halls of Congress, where independence is seen as an annoying tic, Amo Houghton stands apart. How many congressmen come from a family worth as much as $1.6 billion, but whose idea of motoring extravagance is a Ford Taurus station wagon? Who allowed an Episcopal bishop -- M. Thomas Shaw, who heads the Diocese of Boston -- to join his staff so he could see the workings of Congress up close? Who is as likely to talk about his friendship with Donna, the owner of a smoky diner here on East Market Street, as he is about his friendship with Nelson Mandela?</p>
        <p>''It's a pretty dull story,'' Mr. Houghton said.</p>
        <p>He is reluctant to be defined by his wealth, but he knows that his family legacy is as much a part of Southern Tier lore as that Mark Twain is buried in Elmira, or that the Mafia convened in Apalachin, of all places, in 1957. The Houghton family founded the Corning Glass Works, one of the state's largest employers during the last 150 years. His grandfather was a congressman, his father an ambassador to France. Other families might frequent their local library; the Houghton family endowed the rare books collection at Harvard University.</p>
        <p>After a two-year stint in the Marines and a bachelor's and a master's degree from Harvard, he returned to Corning to work in the family business. He was eventually  the chief executive for nearly 20 years, then retired at 60 to choose a path of public service: either be a missionary in Africa, or run for Congress.</p>
        <p>This chief executive's hero was not a Morgan or a Carnegie, but Albert Schweitzer, whose desire to make his life ''an argument'' struck a chord with Mr. Houghton.</p>
        <p>''I was always fascinated by that,'' he said. ''Being a chairman of a Fortune 500 company and then going and doing something in Africa, which was something that I really toyed with after college. I would have loved to have done that.''</p>
        <p>He paused a moment. ''It would have been fun, I tell you,'' he said. ''But that's not where I am.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Houghton reached a kind of compromise. He and his wife continued to spend time in and money on a village in Zimbabwe. But he chose politics as the forum in which to present his life's argument.</p>
        <p>That year, 1986, his Democratic opponent, Larry M. Himelein, tried to portray Mr. Houghton as a lord of the manor trying to mingle with the common folk. But Mr. Houghton's easy and self-deprecating manner thwarted the stereotype in that and later campaigns, so much so that he usually won more than two-thirds of the vote.</p>
        <p>''I don't live the life of the beautiful people,'' he said. ''I just feel a part of the community.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Houghton has distinguished himself in Washington as an independent moderate who cannot be counted on to hew to the leadership's desires. Although he prides himself on being a loyal Republican, he has often challenged party leaders in his efforts to raise the minimum wage, defend the National Endowment for the Arts and generally support abortion rights. Most famously, he was  one of only four House Republicans to vote against all four articles of impeachment against President Clinton in December 1998.</p>
        <p>At times he seems out of place in a political arena that thrives on confrontation and aggression. Last year, he helped establish a bipartisan retreat for members of Congress and their families in Hershey, Pa., in the belief that civility and personal friendship would beget constructive legislation.</p>
        <p>''He's a principled throwback,'' said a former top aide to another congressman.</p>
        <p>Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert, a Republican from Utica, framed his admiration another way.  ''This guy could be doing anything he wants, cruise the Caribbean, anything,'' Mr. Boehlert said. ''He doesn't lack for satisfying all his material needs. But that's not Amo. He's genuinely concerned about making the world a better place, and I mean the world.''</p>
        <p>The wealthy and urbane Mr. Houghton represents a district that a political guidebook calls ''one of the nation's forgotten stretches of territory'': a place of forests and dairy farms, of one-stop villages and small cities, some charmingly quaint, others disturbingly distressed.</p>
        <p>There are some major businesses prospering, among them Corning, which is now a public company (the Houghtons own substantial shares of its stock). It has shifted its focus from glasswork to ceramics technology, including fiber-optic products. But the region at large is struggling economically, he said.</p>
        <p>''You've got dairy farming that is dying, you've got the oil and gas industry that's almost totally dead,'' he said. He listed the names of local companies that had shut down -- Dunkirk Ice Cream and Air Products, among others -- as though he were reciting a roster of the dead.</p>
        <p>Barking his thoughts like the company head he once was, Mr. Houghton asserted that the region had to move beyond its industrial and agricultural bases to one concentrating on communications technology. ''If we try to recreate the success of the last 50 years,'' he said, ''we're going to go right down the tubes.''</p>
        <p>The district's small metropolitan areas -- Olean, Elmira, Salamanca -- have lost about 5 percent of their residents in the last decade. And Jamestown, the largest city in the district, lost 15 percent of its population from 1990 to 1996.</p>
        <p>''So we've got a problem here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One dimension of that problem is politics. The Constitution requires that a census be taken every decade, and that the country's 435 Congressional districts be redrawn to adjust  for population shifts. When Mr. Houghton's grandfather went to Congress in 1919, New York had 43 Congressional districts. It now has 31, and is expected to lose 2 more in the reapportionment after the current census.</p>
        <p>Once the federal government tells the state how many Congressional seats it has lost, the leaders of the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-controlled Assembly will huddle to decide which districts survive. Creative redrawing of boundary lines is often undertaken.  One district might be rectangular, another the shape of Bullwinkle the Moose. The ultimate plan requires the approval of Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican.</p>
        <p>The prevailing theory in New York is that the Republicans will have to sacrifice a district from upstate, while the Democrats will have to forfeit one downstate. One former Congressional aide described the bipartisan dialogue as, ''We shot our puppy, now you shoot yours.''</p>
        <p>''It tends to get a little interesting,'' said John McArdle, the spokesman for Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader.</p>
        <p>Tim Storey, a research analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures, agreed: ''No matter how safe they think their relationship is with the state leadership, they all begin to worry about it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Houghton had planned to step aside this year, he said, but his heir apparent suddenly dropped out of the running. With no incumbent, the district would surely disappear. Jamestown and Olean would meld into a Buffalo district, Corning and Elmira into a Rochester district, and the area's rural needs would be overshadowed by more urban matters.</p>
        <p>If he stepped down, ''This would absolutely be a Christmas banquet,'' Mr. Houghton said. ''People would drool over this area. I don't know if I can save it, but I'm going to go right down to the wire trying to do it.'' Mr. Houghton has already told Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bruno, in forceful but civil terms, that he hoped his personal sacrifice would not be forgotten.</p>
        <p>Whether the avuncular guardian of the 31st District is successful will not be known for a year or more. But he expressed confidence with a certain rural refinement: ''This isn't my first time around the barn.''</p>
