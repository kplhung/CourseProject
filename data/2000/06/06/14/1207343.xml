        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>RATING RUNNING MATES -- The speculation started two weeks ago with a report in Time that Gov. George W. Bush was giving serious consideration to former Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri as his running mate. Mr. Danforth, who retired from the Senate in 1994 and is now leading the special investigation into the Branch Davidian incident in Texas, declined to comment. So did Mr. Bush, except to insist that despite all the rumors in the air, only his wife and his vice-presidential search adviser knew what he was thinking. Whereupon the rumors picked up speed. By the end of last week, Mr. Danforth ranked 15th on the ''Veepstakes Scoreboard,'' the tally the Hotline political tip sheet keeps of how often possible vice-presidential choices merit a major media mention. Mr. Danforth had 10 mentions, compared with 49 for Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, No. 1 on the 53-name list. On Monday, Mr. Danforth made a move, telling The St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he had told Mr. Bush that the idea was ''very tempting,'' but that the six years since he had left Washington and politics had been the best of his life. So wherever Mr. Danforth stood on the rumor list, was he ever really on the Bush list? No comment from Mr. Bush.</p>

        <p>THE PRIMARIES</p>
        <p>VIRGINIANS CHOOSE NOMINEE -- Republicans in the First Congressional District, in southeastern Virginia, chose Delegate Jo Ann Davis yesterday as their nominee to replace Representative Hebert H. Bateman, who is retiring. Ms. Davis defeated Paul Jost, a businessman who spent nearly $1 million of his own money in the race. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Ms. Davis had 35 percent of the vote to Mr. Jost's 30 percent. She will face former Mayor Lawrence Davies of Fredericksburg, a Democrat, in November.</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>STILL TOO CLOSE -- A new national poll has Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore locked in a race too close to call. But as in most recent polls, this one, conducted for ABC News and The Washington Post, shows Mr. Bush with a slight edge, 49 percent to 45 percent. A month ago, an ABC/Post poll gave Mr. Bush a five-point edge; two months ago, Mr. Gore led by one point. The new poll covered 1,204 registered voters, was conducted June 8 to 11 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three points. Respondents gave Mr. Gore the edge in protecting Social Security, 43 percent to 40 percent, but said Mr. Bush would be better with the economy, 46 percent to 41 percent.</p>

        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>BUCHANAN ON ARIZONA BALLOT -- Patrick J. Buchanan, the probable Reform Party presidential nominee, filed for a spot on the Arizona ballot on Monday, pressing to extend his candidacy to all 50 states. So far, there is a Reform line on ballots in 21 states. Mr. Buchanan was in Phoenix to file, telling supporters at the secretary of state's office that if he became president, he would stop the flow of illegal immigrants. To qualify for the Arizona ballot, Mr. Buchanan needed 14,000 petition signatures. He turned in 21,567. Most national preference polls have him pulling less than 5 percent of the vote, not as much as he received in earlier runs but perhaps enough to make him a factor in a close contest.</p>
