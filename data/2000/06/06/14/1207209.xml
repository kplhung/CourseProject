        <p>KINKY movie? Stock market crash? Smoky nightclub?</p>
        <p>Its name is as suggestive as Freud's cigar, yet few people would deduce that Blue Velvet 1929 is in fact a low-key Vietnamese restaurant in the East Village with no more kinks than are usually found in a plate of rice noodles.</p>
        <p>Just as suggestive as the name is the fact that the chef, Hao Chen, who is also an owner, cooked at Indochine for 10 years. Many of his old dishes do reappear at Blue Velvet, but few of Indochine's atmospheric touches have been imported. The ''1929'' part of the name, though, refers to the era of French colonialism in Indochina, and a blue velvet is a French cocktail.</p>
        <p>With such a focus on the French, you can imagine Blue Velvet more as a colonial outpost, where patterned beige walls, a scattering of bamboo plants and a few palm fronds pass for exoticism, than a Vietnamese hangout. The kitchen presents each dish simply but beautifully, graced with banana leaves, stalks of lemon grass and other modest adornments, with food carefully calibrated to intrigue but not intimidate. On the whole, it's pretty well done.</p>
        <p>Blue Velvet excels at delicate and fresh Vietnamese appetizers. Spring rolls ($6.50), which can so frequently be greasy and heavy, are instead crisp and narrow, stuffed with minced chicken and herbs. They are delicious when wrapped in fresh lettuce leaves and dipped in nuoc cham, the invigorating sweet-and-sour Vietnamese condiment of fish sauce, lime juice and vinegar. Goi cuon ($7), or summer rolls, are just as good, with chicken, shrimp, mint and vermicelli wrapped in soft rice paper and dipped in peanut sauce. Banh cuon ($7.25) are even better: chicken, shrimp, bean sprouts and shallots are wrapped in almost transparent crepes and steamed -- just enough, never too much.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen reaches to Thailand for his seafood soup ($6), a mix of shrimp, scallops and fish in a broth that balances the sweetness of coconut milk with a fiery chili kick. A spicy cool beef salad ($9.25) likewise balanced sweet and searing with savory and sour, though I wish the beef chunks had been sliced a bit thinner. Grilled eggplant ($5), topped only with a little lime juice, ginger and sesame seeds, was sterling in its simplicity. Only muc don tom ($8), squid stuffed with ground shrimp and lightly fried, lacked the full spectrum of flavors that made the other dishes exciting.</p>
        <p>Compared with the appetizers, main courses are a mixed bag. Sliced chicken breast ($10.50) is beautifully flavored with anise-like Thai basil, lemon grass and ginger and adorned with sweet potato crisps. Baby back ribs ($10.50) are exceptionally tender and flavorful, marinated in soy, honey and spices. But a fried sea bass fillet with lemon grass ($13.50) is too dry, and fillet of sole amok ($11), a Cambodian preparation in which the fish is bathed in coconut milk and steamed in a banana leaf, never achieves the satiny soft texture that is characteristic of the dish. I did like the dry-yet-rich quality of roast duck with ginger ($11.75), though, and the grilled whole prawns stuffed with ginger and scallions and served over rice noodles ($14.25).</p>
        <p>Blue Velvet has a modest wine list that includes a decent Sancerre for $28 and, if you want to spend a little extra, a fine, steely Chablis from William Fevre for $37.</p>
        <p>Desserts ($5 each) straddle the colonial border, with luscious roasted bananas that are as sweet as compote, and some more-French offerings, like a good lemon tart. The menu lists a hazelnut mousse cake, which I remember from Indochine, but it's never been available. Isn't it always that way in the colonies? We'll just have to make do.</p>
