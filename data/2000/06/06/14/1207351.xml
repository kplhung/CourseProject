        <p>Vice President Al Gore moved yesterday to hitch his presidential campaign to the economic record of President Clinton and called for a new retirement program to supplement Social Security, the elimination of the nation's debt in 12 years, modest tax cuts and systematic increases in spending on education, health care and the environment.</p>
        <p>''I intend to build even higher on the foundation of the Clinton years,''  Mr. Gore declared in a speech in a cramped auditorium at the New-York Historical Society on Manhattan's Upper West Side, standing next to the very symbol of Mr. Clinton's economic policies, Robert E. Rubin, the former secretary of the treasury.</p>
        <p>''Are you better off than you were eight years ago?'' the vice president asked, offering a positive twist to the piercing inquiry Ronald Reagan presented to President Jimmy Carter in 1980. ''For most Americans, I believe the answer is obvious. Together as a nation, we turned the biggest deficits in our history into the biggest surpluses in our history.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, speaking in the heart of a New York neighborhood that has long been identified with liberal political thought, urged creation of trust funds that would systematically divert parts of the nation's projected surplus to spending on education, health care and the environment, as well as to eliminate the nation's debt. He called for creation of new tax-free, voluntary retirement accounts that would supplement Social Security benefits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's speech was advertised as a major address intended to inaugurate a new thematic chapter in a campaign that many Democrats have come to view as adrift. For the next three weeks, he plans to deliver a series of speeches elaborating on his message of ''prosperity and progress,'' with one of the weeks devoted to environmental issues.</p>
        <p>As part of the initiative, Mr. Gore also conducted a round of news interviews in New York, including a meeting with members of the editorial board, a reporter and editors of The New York Times, where he suggested that he was concerned about recent studies that showed high rates of mistakes in death penalty cases. [Excerpts, Page A20.]</p>
        <p>In his economic speech, Mr. Gore restated his support for a variety of limited tax reductions, including the elimination of the so-called marriage penalty for working couples. And he urged that excess Medicare funds be put into ''an ironclad box,'' preventing Congress from using them for other programs, like the big tax cut being pursued by his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>But these presumably complicated proposals were addressed in a few quick and fleeting sentences. Instead of offering details, Mr. Gore, speaking broadly, sought to wrap himself in the legacy of Mr. Clinton's economic accomplishments, while offering his general views on how the nation should best use the surpluses that are being projected for the years ahead.</p>
        <p>''None of this boom happened by accident,'' he declared, adding: ''To those who say prosperity has achieved its full reach, I say: Just watch us. We will deepen prosperity, and extend it to the homes and hearts of every family.''</p>
        <p>Although he did not mention Mr.  Bush by name, he offered clear criticism of Mr. Bush's advocacy for large tax cuts, and for allowing the private investment of some Social Security funds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's advisers declined to offer much elaboration on any of the proposals, saying that the vice president would instead seek to stretch out this repackaging of his candidacy by returning to each of these subjects in coming days. Most of the proposals Mr. Gore said would provide the foundation of his campaign through the summer came as a result of the projected surpluses that  have allowed him to advocate new spending without calling for new taxes or cuts in other programs.</p>
        <p>His call for new spending on traditionally Democratic issues -- health care, education and the environment -- marked a sharp shift both for the candidate himself, who has spent much of this campaign criticizing Republican initiatives, as well as for Democratic presidential candidates over the past decade, who have refrained from offering the kind of spending programs that might open them to attack from Republicans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, criticized the speech, describing it as representative of an activist view of government.</p>
        <p>''By offering new ways the federal government can gain more control, apparently Al Gore does not trust individual Americans to make decisions regarding their own retirement, health care needs, education, and finances,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''Just as hard-working Americans deserve credit for our economic prosperity, Governor Bush believes Americans should have more control over saving for their retirement, planning for their children's education.''</p>
        <p>There were numerous indications of the importance that Mr. Gore and his aides attached to a speech that his campaign hopes will shift the terms of debate in his contest with Mr. Bush. The vice president tinkered with the text until the very last minute, and then read from a Teleprompter, with barely a variation, when delivering it to his invited audience. To make sure that no one missed the point, the stage was festooned with a banner reading ''Prosperity and Progress.''</p>
        <p>His aides arranged for him to spend much of the afternoon giving interviews for the nightly television news. The speech was also taped for possible campaign advertisements.</p>
        <p>As has been fairly standard in recent weeks, Mr. Gore avoided mentioning Mr. Bush by name. Which is not to say he was not critical of his opponent.</p>
        <p>For one thing, he suggested that the large tax cuts advocated by Mr. Bush would derail the nation's economic recovery. ''I won't be profligate with your money,'' Mr. Gore declared. ''I won't spend money that we don't have on a tax cut that our economy can't afford.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, he criticized Mr. Bush's proposal to allow some private investment of Social Security funds. ''I will oppose any effort to make Social security a gamble, instead of a guarantee.''</p>
        <p>That said, a number of polls have found strong support among voters for Mr. Bush's Social Security plan, and Mr. Gore sought yesterday to counter that with his own plan. ''Social Security Plus,'' as he named it, would allow taxpayers to invest a certain amount of money every year to be used for retirement, beyond the payroll taxes that workers pay for Social Security.</p>
        <p>That money, as well as any interest earned on the investment, would be exempt from taxes, though further details on the program, including the amount of annual investment allowed, remained to be worked out, said Mr. Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane. Traditional I.R.A.'s defer taxes.</p>
        <p>Over all, the vice president's speech appeared carefully written to allow him to present himself at once as fiscally conservative and generous in spending. Thus, he called for creation of trust programs under which a specific amount of projected surpluses would go into spending programs. But there would be no money for such programs if the surplus disappeared.</p>
        <p>In some ways, the spending proposals made Mr. Gore sound like a pre-Clinton Democrat as he spoke about ''reforming our schools, curing disease and making all of our families healthier than ever before, and protecting the environment.'' But he also sounded tried and true Republican themes, saying: ''We can never go back to the days when we spent money that we just don't have'' and describing his plan to pay the debt as ''plain good capitalism.''</p>
        <p>In the past year, Mr. Gore has drifted back and forth in terms of his willingness to align himself with the president. But yesterday, he clearly stood on the Clinton administration's shoulders, arguing that its economic policies account for today's economic prosperity.</p>
        <p>''Some want to challenge the record of the Clinton administration,'' he said. ''In my view, that record is clear and undeniable.''</p>
        <p>In His Own Words  AL GORE</p>
        <p>Speaking yesterday at the New-York Historical Society about prosperity:</p>
        <p>''I propose that we set aside enough of the surplus to strengthen Medicare -- and then do for Medicare what we have done for Social Security, by putting the Medicare trust fund off-budget and into in an iron-clad lockbox. If we do that, then Congress can never try to raid Medicare, or take it away. We will keep Medicare strong for decades to come. . . .</p>
        <p>We have to guarantee that Social Security is there for you when you retire. As president, I will keep that sacred trust. I will oppose any effort to make Social Security a gamble, instead of a guarantee. I am not going to let anyone take the ''security'' out of  Social Security. I will oppose the effort to privatize Social Security, which could take at least a trillion dollars out of the trust fund and could drive our entire budget back into deficit. And with Social Security as the unshakeable foundation, people should be able to save and invest more for their retirement without gambling away their Social Security. I propose a new way to help them do that: Social Security Plus -- new, tax-free voluntary accounts that let you save, invest and build on top of the guaranteed foundation of Social Security.''</p>
