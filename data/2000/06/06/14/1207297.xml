        <p>Kobe Bryant shot around today at the Indiana Pacers' Conseco Fieldhouse in flip-flops, laughing and moving without a limp. There was little sign of the sprained left ankle that kept him out of Sunday's game, and even less evidence that it would leave the Los Angeles' Lakers star guard sidelined for a second straight game.</p>
        <p>When asked if anything could keep him on the trainer's table for another game of the National Basketball Association finals, a jovial Bryant gave a lighthearted yet conclusive response.</p>
        <p>''Any snipers in the room?'' he asked. ''I don't think so.''</p>
        <p>Coach Phil Jackson and the Lakers refused to end the guessing with a definitive statement on Bryant's availability, but even the often evasive Jackson said he expected his team's greatest acrobat to return Wednesday night in Game 4.</p>
        <p>''I think everybody will agree that he'll be ready to play,'' Jackson said. ''But we can't make that statement now obviously because it's still 30 hours before game time, and we still haven't practiced to see what effect he'll have. But we pointed towards this game in hopes that he'll be able to play, and he's anxious to play.''</p>
        <p>Though Bryant will play at perhaps only 85 percent of his optimum, his presence could end the drama and suspense that rejuvenated the series on Sunday. The Pacers' convincing 100-91 victory in Game 3, after they had lost the first two games in Los Angeles, and the brashness they displayed en route were the first indicators that they could offer the heavily favored Lakers a challenge.</p>
        <p>The Lakers' disjointed performance without Bryant also resurrected a season-long rift between Jackson and Glen Rice. Rice, the onetime huge scorer, thought he would play a more prominent role in the offense with Bryant out of the lineup. But he played only 27 minutes, including just one in the fourth quarter, and scored just 7 points.</p>
        <p>Rice voiced his frustration on Monday, and his wife, Christina Fernandez Rice, verbally tagged Jackson when interviewed for a column that appeared today in The Los Angeles Times. She implied that Jackson had a personal vendetta against Rice and stated that if she were in her husband's shoes, she would have ''already been Latrell Sprewell II.''</p>
        <p>''Jackson has never wanted Glen,'' she was quoted as saying. ''He's always wanted somebody like Scottie Pippen, and this is his way of getting back at management for not letting him make a trade. This is Jackson's way of showing the people on top of him who is in control. It's crazy.''</p>
        <p>Jackson said this morning that he had not read the column and that his relationship with Rice was fine. The Lakers players insisted that the comments by Rice and his wife had not created any discord or undue pressure in the locker room, and that seemed to be the case as they lounged and joked in today's news media session. Ron Harper gave interviews while lying on his back, and Shaquille O'Neal answered several questions jokingly.</p>
        <p>Rice, who said he would not approach Jackson about the issue, tried to play down their differences.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I created any distractions, and I don't look at it as being controversy,'' Rice said. ''I'm trying to echo that I'm trying to help my team win. I've just said that in the fourth quarter, I'd like to be out on the floor trying to help my team win. I'm all about trying to give our team an advantage, and I can't give my team an advantage being on the bench.''</p>
        <p>Bryant's return is likely to lift the spotlight off any rift between Jackson and Rice and return Rice to being a third offensive option whose number of shots are irrelevant. But how effective Bryant can be is in question. With high flying, cutting and quickness being such a huge part of his game, he may be unable to make anywhere near his usual contribution.</p>
        <p>''Kobe's a player that plays a lot off the floor, and I'll anticipate he'll play more on the floor rather than being a guy that's jumping and hopping and doing a lot of stuff that requires that speed and elevation that he can use,'' Jackson said. ''He'll play a much more controlled game.''</p>
        <p>Defensively, Bryant will be attacked by the Pacers, who will attempt to exploit his limited mobility. If he is unable to help slow down Reggie Miller, who scored 33 points in Game 3, and Jalen Rose, who totaled 51 points the last two games, the Lakers will have a war on their hands. In Game 1, the only game Bryant was fully available for, Miller and Rose combined for 19 points.</p>
        <p>Indiana is eager to dispel the widely held belief that it would be down by 3-0 in the four-of-seven-game series if Bryant had not been injured.</p>
        <p>''They have a lot of people that's willing to make excuses for them,'' Rose said. ''I think when we tie up the series, 2-2, then people will start respecting us a little bit more.''</p>
        <p>Especially if they tie it with Bryant on the floor.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The Pacers have implied that SHAQUILLE O'NEAL has been breaking the three-second rule regularly by camping in the paint. O'Neal scoffed at the notion. ''I never just stay in there for more than three seconds,'' he said. ''You have to go in there and, at the last point of the second, step out.''</p>
        <p>JALEN ROSE said O'Neal was getting the superstar treatment from the officials. ''That's the nature of being the M.V.P., and he deserves that,'' Rose said. ''But it's not fair.''</p>
