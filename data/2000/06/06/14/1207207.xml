      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Tired of the same old balsamico? Sal-Mar's port wine vinegar from Portugal is ruby-colored and mellow and has a sweet aftertaste and a winy richness. It is excellent combined with a light but fruity olive oil for salad, especially one with a bitter ingredient like radicchio.</p>
        <p>The vinegar also makes an intriguing cookie to serve with a glass of port. Cream one stick butter with  1/2 teaspoon salt and  3/4 cup sugar. Add a beaten egg and 2 tablespoons of the vinegar. Fold in 1 1/2 cups flour mixed with  1/4 teaspoon baking powder. Mix in  1/2 cup chopped toasted almonds. Drop by scant tablespoonfuls on baking sheets lined with parchment paper; lightly flatten the mounds, and bake on the upper rack of the oven at 350 degrees about 15 minutes, until browned around the edges.</p>
