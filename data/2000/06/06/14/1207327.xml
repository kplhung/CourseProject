        <p>The Seagram Company and Vivendi S.A., the French media conglomerate, plan to announce today that Vivendi and one of its units are negotiating to buy Seagram for $30.6 billion in stock, people close to the talks said last night.</p>
        <p>Though the companies will not announce any price, two people close to the talks said  Vivendi would pay more than $70 a share for Seagram, whose stock closed today at $53 a share, up $2.375, as rumors of the merger circulated first in Europe and then in the United States.

        <p>The Seagram Company and Vivendi S.A., the French media conglomerate, plan to announce today that Vivendi and one of its units are negotiating to buy Seagram for $30.6 billion in stock, people close to the talks said last night.</p>
        <p>Though the companies will not announce any price, two people close to the talks said  Vivendi would pay more than $70 a share for Seagram, whose stock closed today at $53 a share, up $2.375, as rumors of the merger circulated first in Europe and then in the United States. That would be a premium of 32 percent. Vivendi will also assume about $8 billion in Seagram's debt.</p>
        <p>The price, however, will be influenced by the price of Vivendi stock, which trades in Paris, and by foreign-exchange rates. Shares of Vivendi fell 0.9 euro yesterday, to 115 euros a share, or $110.50. The company's American depository receipts, each of which represents one-fifth of a share, rose 50 cents, to $22.875.</p>
        <p>According to people close to the talks, even if Vivendi's stock or the exchange rate falls precipitously, Seagram shareholders will still receive most of the $30 billion price because of a sort of insurance known as a collar. In general, collars guarantee about 90 percent of the initial price. In this case, Seagram shareholders would get $63 a share.</p>
        <p>Among its media properties, Vivendi owns Canal Plus, a pay-television operation that is participating in the bid, and Havas, an advertising company. In addition, Vivendi jointly owns an Internet service provider with Vodafone AirTouch of Britain. Beyond that, it has interests in energy distribution and water supply.</p>
        <p>The company also controls Cegetel, France's No. 2 telecommunications services operator, and owns 24.5 percent of British Sky Broadcasting.</p>
        <p>Seagram owns a large record business that includes Polygram, Universal Pictures, a 45 percent stake in the USA Networks, theme parks and the Seagram liquor business.</p>
        <p>The combined company would be in an excellent position to compete against larger rivals like the pending combination of Time Warner and America Online. Media companies like Vivendi are aggressively integrating production and distribution. However, the synergies that these companies have sought over the last decade have proved elusive, and it is not entirely clear what the benefits will ultimately be.</p>
        <p>Seagram, based in Montreal, declined to comment late yesterday. According to the people close to the talks, Jean-Marie Messier, the chairman and chief executive of Vivendi, would become chief executive of the combined company, which would have $65 billion in revenue and a market value of $100 billion. Vivendi is already the 10th-largest company in Europe.</p>
        <p>Edgar Bronfman Jr., the chief executive of Seagram, would have a ''meaningful'' role in the combined company, one person close to the discussions said. According to another person close to the talks, Mr. Bronfman had been negotiating to retain control of the record company, but it did not appear that he would retain that role.</p>
        <p>The company has privately said that it could not compete in an era of mega-mergers in its own field. Nevertheless, a decision to sell seemed to indicate that the board was more willing to cash out its interests than continue to allow Mr. Bronfman to build the company or at least maintain control of the record operations in the case of a sale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bronfman's tenure at Seagram, where he took over in 1994 and reshaped the company from a liquor company into a liquor-and-entertainment business, has been criticized by analysts and industry experts for poor strategic decisions and management appointments.</p>
        <p>A sale would extricate the Bronfman family from dominance of the business and bring them healthy gains. However, Seagram's stock has sharply underperformed the overall market. When Mr. Bronfman took over in 1994, the stock was trading at $31.50 a share. Since then, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index has risen more than 200 percent, while Seagram's stock has increased 68 percent. Even if the deal were to close tomorrow at $70 a share, pushing the rise to 122 percent, Seagram's performance would still trail the S.&amp; P. 500.</p>
        <p>As to Vivendi's plans for the liquor business, a person close to the talks said Vivendi had been in talks with Allied Domecq of Britain to sell a 40 percent stake in the liquor business, but Seagram declined to comment, and no one could be reached at Vivendi late yesterday to confirm this.</p>
        <p>There were also reports that Terry Semel, a former co-chairman of Time Warner, would run Universal Pictures. Mr. Semel did not return phone calls late yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Bronfman family, which controls Seagram, though looking for a sale, has been eager to minimize capital-gains taxes. Although there was talk of selling the liquor division separately from the entertainment operations, a sale of either division for cash would have risked capital gains.</p>
