        <p>House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert plans to unveil an effort on Wednesday to raise $16 million from Republicans in the House to use in close races this fall, Congressional officials said tonight.</p>
        <p>The fund-raising campaign, which members called unusually aggressive, would seek to protect the Republicans' six-seat majority in the House and erode a substantial Democratic edge in contributions, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastert, who is expected to announce the campaign at a breakfast for members on Wednesday morning, wants to raise the $16 million through pledges from the 222 Republicans in the House, with the money to be used for the 35 highly contested races in the fall elections.</p>
        <p>The effort, which was first reported in Wednesday's Washington Post, would require members to sign sheets committing themselves to raising a specific amount for the National Republican Congressional Committee. Members who failed to raise what they had pledged could face the reckoning of the speaker, who will take their performance into account when handing out committee assignments, the officials said.</p>
        <p>''It's obvious we're going to have to all pull together because the Democrats are raising a lot of money,'' said John P. Feehery, Mr. Hastert's spokesman. ''The speaker believes that getting resources to our candidates in need is very important.''</p>
        <p>In March, the most recent month for which figures are available, Democrats in the House had $28.6 million in cash, compared with $18 million for Republicans. The shortfall is particularly worrisome for Republicans, given their 4-to-1 edge in the previous two elections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Feehery said that the drive was likely to cause some unhappiness among members but that getting resources to the ''grass roots'' was particularly urgent to maintain control of the House.</p>
        <p>The Republican strategy is to develop campaign messages that are tailored for individual districts but coordinated on a national level.</p>
        <p>One of the likely beneficiaries will be Representative Steven T. Kuykendall of California.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuykendall's district, which includes cities near Los Angeles, is being contested by a Democrat, Jane Harman, a former House member who has strong personal financial resources and has already received a boost from party luminaries like Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, who recently visited her district.</p>
        <p>''Our opponent is already employing the assistance of the Democratic leadership,'' said Adam Mendelsohn, an adviser to Mr. Kuykendall. ''In order to compete with her, the assistance from our leadership is going to be critical.''</p>
