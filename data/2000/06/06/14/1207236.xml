        <p>IT was a hot afternoon, and I was having lunch at the Cub Room Cafe, where, with the doors flung open, it felt like a snack shack on the beach. I ordered the Cobb salad and sat awaiting the big bowl and the clumsy flavors that would knock me over the head like a club.</p>
        <p>They never showed up.</p>
        <p>What did was a perfectly arranged collage -- chopped egg, cubes of grilled chicken, pebbles of blue cheese, ripe buttery avocado and crisp strands of romaine. Every component was thoughtfully rendered, and as I mixed them and dabbed into a salty, eggy mayonnaise, each bite was a lively, original blend. It was brilliant and simple -- exactly what a chopped salad should be, but almost never is.</p>
        <p>Most of the time, a chopped salad -- whether it be a Cobb, a Waldorf or something less familiar -- more closely resembles a pile of rubble through which you must tediously plow with your fork. But when a chopped salad is done well, it is a synthesis of seasonal flavors that transcends its parts.</p>
        <p>Based on chopped lettuce, it can include any number of ingredients, from peas to pancetta to capers. Each is chosen to add a dimension of flavor and is cut in sizes that allow it to remain distinguishable but let it blend with the other ingredients. Then, the whole is finished with a dressing that's thick enough for everything to cling loosely together. It is a composition with something to say, like a well-made sauce.</p>
        <p>A good chopped salad will also be deceivingly casual, a kind of wistful tonic that's cooling and soothing at this time of year and certainly not serious.</p>
        <p>Some chefs and home cooks are beginning to recognize its potential, seeing the chopped salad more as a canvas for seasonal produce than as a haphazard meal. But most are still tethered to the classic Cobb, which originated in 1926 at the Brown Derby in Los Angeles. Unlike the Cub Room Cafe's version, it is too often a fine example of American excessiveness -- big piles of bacon, blue cheese, egg and impenetrable chunks of out-of-season vegetables. It fills you up! It has all the food groups! But so does a hoagie.</p>
        <p>Variations can be a problem, too. At Icon, the Cobb salad has watercress, pieces of smoked chicken, stringy strands of prosciutto, chopped egg and macadamia nuts, all smothered in a sticky goat-cheese dressing. Halfway through, I was worn out.</p>
        <p>But there are some good, inventive chopped salads out there, like the one at Clementine with asparagus, haricots verts, corn and tuna, and the one at Spazzia with endive, mushrooms, chickpeas, pecorino Romano and tomatoes. Most of the ingredients in both are soft, so the textures have varied levels of tenderness and subtle crunch. They are also intensely flavored, and are cut into tiny pieces so you can get a bit of everything in each forkful.</p>
        <p>Complex salads are nothing new. When composing a salad, wrote the English diarist John Evelyn in 1698, ''every plant should come in to bear its part, without being overpower'd by some herb of a stronger taste, so as to endanger the native sapor and virtue of the rest; but fall into their places, like the notes in music.''</p>
        <p>Among those notes, he added, should be some gentle, some strong. It is the cook's responsibility to ''reconcile all dissonancies.'' A complex dish will always have dissonances. Reconciling them is the challenge that makes cooking interesting.</p>
        <p>In a chopped salad, there should be sweet, sour, salty and bitter parts to blend and balance. Ingredients aren't so much chopped as they are reduced to a size that allows them to contribute to the greater goal: the well-balanced, tasty bite, in which every ingredient gets to sing and mingle. There is no hierarchy. No leaves are positioned as sculpture. No herbs are sprinkled in superfluously. If you're a truffle, you can plan on swimming next to celery and among iceberg lettuce.</p>
        <p>Many cuisines include different kinds of chopped salads. In Middle Eastern cooking, a tabbouleh could be considered a kind of chopped salad. So could many Mediterranean salads, as well as the German shredded salads with cabbages and vinegar. But chopped salads in American cooking owe more to the salade compose, the composed salad from France. The main difference between the American and French versions is that the components in a composed salad tend to be left in larger pieces.</p>
        <p>In the ''Joy of Cooking,'' which has a strong French influence, there are many salads that could qualify as chopped salads, even if that is not what they are called. An asparagus and egg salad is mixed with chopped watercress, torn lettuce, olives and capers. A chiffonade salad in the 1950 ''Gourmet Cookbook'' is made up of shredded romaine and chicory, julienned celery, quartered tomatoes, chopped eggs, watercress and chopped beets. It is, even with its French name (''chiffonade'' means cut in strips), a perfect intersection of the salade compose and the chopped salad.</p>
        <p>Many of these old recipes, however, feel painfully dated. Celery is no longer the standard crunch ingredient. There seems no reason to include meat or eggs in every chopped salad, or to begin with iceberg or romaine lettuce.</p>
        <p>More ingredients, though, also complicate matters. Using what is in season makes it easier to narrow the possibilities. And you should never be tempted to unload your vegetable drawer, and its limp celery and tattered carrots, into the mix. Chopped salad may look like a chaotic jumble, capable of concealing feeble contributors, but it is not. Any inferior parts surface like a ripple on a calm sea.</p>
        <p>As is often the case with cooking, it's best to start out slowly. One of my favorite chopped salads is one I had a few years ago at Molyvos. A homogenous green mound, it looked about as appealing as a lump of mown grass. But it was crisp: a chiffonade of romaine, heady with dill and stiffened by shavings of scallion and a sprinkling of lemon juice. There was no pretending to be a meal. It was fresh and alive and shameless in its simplicity.</p>
        <p>I have made it more times than I can remember. It changes every time. Sometimes, the scallions are strong, or the olive oil I have has a brisk bite. So I adjust, adding more lemon juice or romaine, depending on the needs of the salad.</p>
        <p>Chopped salads are like that. They are not formulas but riddles to unravel. You begin with flavors you like together, say, peas, asparagus, tarragon and romaine. You could simply blanch the asparagus and peas, lay them on top of romaine leaves and sprinkle over a tarragon vinaigrette. It would be a perfectly good salad.</p>
        <p>Or you could blanch the peas and asparagus, then slice the asparagus thinly like a scallion, chop the tarragon and shred the romaine, throwing in a little arugula for spiciness. Mixed together, it would become something quite different. Each bite would have the crunch of romaine, the sweetness of peas, the fragrant bite of tarragon and arugula. And only the peas would be recognizable in the mix, coming across like pearls hidden in a thicket.</p>
        <p>It is pleasant to have such pearls and surprises, but they cannot be done with just appearance in mind. Ingredients need to be broken down into sizes that allow them to contribute to each bite in proportion to their flavor. Romaine lettuce can be left in large squares, but something peppery like arugula is better off chopped more finely so that it distributes more evenly. Potatoes and other starchy ingredients should not be left too large, or they might dampen more delicate flavors. The same goes for strong flavors like onion, which can cancel out almost anything.</p>
        <p>Ingredients should not be all the same size either. A variety of size and texture makes the salad more interesting, just as a layering of flavors is stimulating. If one ingredient is cubed, you might want to cut another into small wedges or circles.</p>
        <p>Chopped salads take practice. In the last week, I made many, and not all were successful. I tried a play on salade nicoise with tuna, beans, romaine, radicchio, olives and an anchovy dressing. It was a textural nightmare. The tuna, which was cooked rare, felt slimy once dressed with the vinaigrette; the radicchio was chewy; and the romaine, annoyingly crisp and virtuous. And it was a reminder of why the dish, with its parts left intact and separate, has become a classic.</p>
        <p>Another salad, a mixture of fava beans, green beans, chopped green curly leaf lettuce, strands of basil and lumps of sheep's milk ricotta, tasted great in my mind but took a nose dive in reality. The favas were too bitter, the basil strands too large, overwhelming each bite, and the ricotta came across as flabby. It needed work.</p>
        <p>I replaced the favas with sweeter navy beans, the green beans with haricots verts and the ricotta with shards of tangy ricotta salata. I chopped the basil so that you got less of it and more cheese in each bite. Then, I let the salad sit for about 15 minutes before serving, to allow the vinaigrette to penetrate the beans and for the flavors and textures to meld.</p>
        <p>It is counterintuitive to let a salad sit after dressing it, but it is a step crucial to most chopped salads, which have a lot of things going on. This way, flavors are distinct but only vaguely so, and textural contrasts are clear but not too severe. Romaine lettuce, for instance, can be quite crisp and, if not left to wilt a little, can be unpleasantly crunchy against a mushroom or a peeled tomato.</p>
        <p>As a final touch, I remembered a recipe by Diane Forley, the chef at Verbena, for a composed salad of artichokes, arugula and pumpkinseed oil, and I sprinkled a little pumpkinseed oil over the top. It transformed the salad and my mood, particularly after peeling all of those fava beans.</p>
        <p>It was the same feeling I got when I added walnut oil to a salad of red potatoes, endive, hazelnuts and celery with a sherry vinaigrette. At that moment, everything seemed to coalesce. Texturally, there were crisp and soft parts, moist components and crunchy, dense pieces. There was bitterness from the endive, acid and deep background flavor from the sherry vinegar, earthiness from the potatoes and hazelnuts, and sweetness from the lettuce and potatoes. All were distinguishable. None were dominant. And all were better than on their own.</p>
        <p>That riddle was, at last, unwound.</p>
        <p>POTATO, ENDIVE AND HAZELNUT CHOPPED SALAD  Time: 30 minutes, plus standing time</p>
        <p>3 baby Red Bliss potatoes  2 teaspoons best quality aged sherry vinegar</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard  Sea salt  Freshly ground black pepper  3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>1/2 tablespoon walnut oil or hazelnut oil  1 teaspoon heavy cream  1 cup thinly sliced red leaf lettuce  1 cup chopped romaine lettuce</p>
        <p>1/2 cup endive, cut diagonally into  3/4-inch slices  1 rib celery, cut into  1/4-inch cubes  2 1/2 tablespoons hazelnuts, toasted and coarsely chopped.</p>
        <p>1. In a medium pan, cover potatoes with water and cook over medium-high heat until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and let cool, then cut into  1/2-inch cubes (keep skin on).</p>
        <p>2. In a small bowl, whisk together the sherry vinegar, mustard, large pinch salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in olive oil and walnut oil until emulsified, then whisk in cream. Taste and adjust seasoning; it should be intensely flavored.</p>
        <p>3. In a serving bowl, combine lettuces, endive, celery, hazelnuts and potatoes. Pour half the dressing on top, and toss until well coated, adding more if necessary. Let sit for 15 minutes before serving. Taste, and adjust seasoning once more before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>PEA, ASPARAGUS AND ARUGULA CHOPPED SALAD  Time: 30 minutes, plus standing time</p>
        <p>Sea salt</p>
        <p>1/2 cup peas  6 spears asparagus, trimmed  1 tablespoon thinly sliced garlic chives, or chives and  1/2 small garlic clove, crushed  2 teaspoons white wine vinegar  1 teaspoon Dijon mustard  Freshly ground black pepper  3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  1 cup roughly chopped baby arugula  2 cups  1/4-inch slices lollo rosso or red leaf lettuce  1 tablespoon chopped tarragon  1  1/2-inch piece daikon radish, sliced into paper thin rounds with a vegetable peeler (cut rounds in half if larger than 1 inch in diameter).</p>
        <p>1. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add peas, and cook until tender but still slightly firm, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove peas to a strainer and cool under cold running water. Let dry. Bring water back to a boil. Add asparagus, and cook until tender but still slightly crisp, about 4 minutes. Drain, and cool under cold running water. Dry on a dish towel, then slice into  3/4-inch pieces (there should be about 1 cup). Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. In a small bowl, whisk together garlic chives, vinegar, mustard, large pinch salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in oil until emulsified. Taste and adjust seasoning; it should be highly seasoned.</p>
        <p>3. In a large serving bowl, combine arugula, lollo rosso, peas, asparagus, tarragon and daikon radish. Pour about half the dressing on top, and toss to coat vegetables, adding more dressing if necessary. Let sit for 15 minutes. Taste, and adjust seasoning once more before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>A LOOSE INTERPRETATION OF COBB SALAD  Time: 30 minutes, plus standing time</p>
        <p>1 egg  1 teaspoon peanut oil  3 slices prosciutto  2 teaspoons lemon juice</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard  Sea salt  Freshly ground black pepper  3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>1/2 ripe avocado  1 cup roughly chopped frisee  1 cup roughly chopped green curly leaf lettuce  1 cup roughly chopped watercress  1 thin scallion, very thinly sliced.</p>
        <p>1. Bring a small pan of water to a boil. Add egg, and simmer for 9 minutes. Drain, and cool under cold running water. Peel and set aside. Place a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Add peanut oil, then slices of prosciutto. Saute until crisped and browned on both sides, about 2 minutes. Remove to a dish lined with paper towel. Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. In a bowl, whisk together lemon juice, mustard, large pinch salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in olive oil until emulsified. Taste and adjust seasoning; it should be intense.</p>
        <p>3. Slice avocado half into  1/4-inch wedges, then crosswise into  1/4-inch triangular pieces. Chop prosciutto into  1/4-inch cubes. In a large serving bowl, combine lettuces, watercress, scallion, avocado and prosciutto. Pour half the dressing on top, and toss to coat, adding more if necessary. Taste and adjust seasoning. Using back of a spoon, press egg, in halves, through a fine sieve over salad. Let it fall evenly to cover salad. Let sit 15 minutes before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>GREEN BEAN, WHITE BEAN, BASIL AND RICOTTA CHOPPED SALAD  Time: 30 minutes, plus standing time</p>

        <p>1/2 cup chopped green curly leaf lettuce or red leaf lettuce  2 tablespoons coarsely chopped basil</p>
        <p>1/3 cup ricotta salata, shaved into  irregular 1-inch shards with a vegetable peeler  4 chive flowers, broken into pieces, or 1 tablespoon chives in  1/2-inch slices  Pumpkinseed oil, for sprinkling.</p>
        <p>1. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add haricots verts, and cook until tender but still slightly crisp, about 3 minutes. Drain, then cool under cold running water. Cut into 1-inch pieces (there should be about 1 cup). Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. In a small bowl, whisk together vinegar and a large pinch of salt. Slowly whisk in grapeseed oil until emulsified. Taste and adjust seasoning; it should be highly seasoned.</p>
        <p>3. In a large serving bowl, combine haricots verts, navy beans, fennel, watercress, lettuce, basil, cheese and chive flowers. Pour half the dressing on top, and toss to coat, adding more if necessary. Taste, and adjust seasoning. Let sit for 15 minutes, then toss, and adjust seasoning once more.
