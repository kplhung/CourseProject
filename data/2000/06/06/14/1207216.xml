        <p>THE financial district can be a lonely place after 5 o'clock. When the wheeling and dealing stop and the post-work martinis and cosmopolitans go down the hatch, an eerie calm descends over Lower Manhattan. Footsteps echo on narrow sidewalks, and as the shadows deepen, it takes but a short leap of the imagination to picture Peter Stuyvesant's peg leg rounding the next corner.</p>
        <p>The peculiar air of desolation adds a certain piquancy to the evening meal at Vine. The small cluster of cocktail drinkers at the bar seem almost defiant, the last holdouts in a neighborhood that has emptied out faster than a day trader's bank account. The diners may be the oddest assortment of customers I've ever laid eyes on. Either the Wall Street night shift is made up of dot-com eccentrics, or the restaurant has become a haven for foreigners who have failed to orient themselves after a hard day at the South Street Seaport. Never have I seen so many T-shirts in a serious restaurant.</p>

        <p>THE financial district can be a lonely place after 5 o'clock. When the wheeling and dealing stop and the post-work martinis and cosmopolitans go down the hatch, an eerie calm descends over Lower Manhattan. Footsteps echo on narrow sidewalks, and as the shadows deepen, it takes but a short leap of the imagination to picture Peter Stuyvesant's peg leg rounding the next corner.</p>
        <p>The peculiar air of desolation adds a certain piquancy to the evening meal at Vine. The small cluster of cocktail drinkers at the bar seem almost defiant, the last holdouts in a neighborhood that has emptied out faster than a day trader's bank account. The diners may be the oddest assortment of customers I've ever laid eyes on. Either the Wall Street night shift is made up of dot-com eccentrics, or the restaurant has become a haven for foreigners who have failed to orient themselves after a hard day at the South Street Seaport. Never have I seen so many T-shirts in a serious restaurant.</p>
        <p>Even in a neighborhood desperate for good food, Vine makes a very mild impression. It is pleasant, airy and woody, with views of the New York Stock Exchange out the tall front windows. The brightly colored photographs of candles, silverware and bottles on the walls, doctored to look a little like photo-realist paintings, have a mindlessly chipper quality. The food is quite decent, in a middle-of-the-road, easy-listening sort of way. No one is going to stop in midsentence and exclaim over it. But no one is going to complain, either.</p>
        <p>In just about any American city of half a million or fewer inhabitants, Vine would automatically be the best place in town. Here, it merges into the crowd. Such is the current state of cuisine in New York.</p>
        <p>Vine sounds as though it might be a wine-oriented restaurant, like Veritas. It's not. The food, in the hands of the much-traveled John Tesar, formerly of 13 Barrow, the Dining Room on Columbus and several other restaurants, plows fairly familiar ground, usually described as new American with international accents. When it's good, it's very good.</p>
        <p>I'd almost given up hope of finding escargots that did not have the texture and flavor of pencil erasers. Vine came to the rescue with what looked like a small potpie, beneath whose crust bubbled a thick, garlicky lava pungent with Roquefort cheese and chock full of tender, hefty snails and walnut bits. The chili-rubbed pork tenderloin, a high-rent down-home entree, also showed a bit of flash, with a dense, creamy dollop of Cheddar grits and golden fried okra in a light sheath of breading.</p>
        <p>Many of the dishes in a lighter vein, however, simply cruised along on autopilot. A salad of Maine crab and yellowfin tuna in tomato water was fresh and pleasant, and you could say the same for another seafood salad, this one with octopus and baby squid in an avocado and lemon thyme dressing. Things got rolling when Mr. Tesar applied butter, in an appetizer of seared skate with brown butter and pineapple, but conch fritters immediately soaked up their mint-grapefruit vinaigrette like sponges and lay sodden on the plate.</p>
        <p>Richer seems to be better, like the truffle-studded sweetbreads, with a potato and goat-cheese raviolo, or the confit and breast of duck with sweet potato hash and an herbed potato pie. Pan-roasted swordfish, however, seemed like a beached whale, surrounded by an overly timid lemon grass and cilantro nage, baby squid rings and melted Napa cabbage. All that activity on the plate, and so little forward motion. One entree is a real eyeful: slices of sashimi-grade tuna, served rare, and surrounded by tall, sculptured obelisks of roasted parsnip and carrot, with paintlike spatterings of beet sauce, a carrot-ginger reduction and parsley water. It's a party on a plate -- fun to look at, but ordinary to eat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tesar's indulgent streak pays off on the dessert menu. A cube-shaped lemon souffle tart, gratifyingly dense, gets a sharp pick-me-up from a pool of lemon curd and a little scoop of lemon ice cream. And the chocolate souffle, adrift in a flood of chocolate soup, is serenely voluptuous.</p>
        <p>Top honors, however, go to the peanut butter mousse, balanced on a raft of caramelized bananas soaked in buttered rum. It brings back the Reese's peanut butter cup in adult form, with a touch of charm in two miniature orbs of chocolate sorbet and peanut butter ice cream perched on top of the mousse. The dessert is almost too darling to eat.</p>
        <p>Late one recent evening, a lost-looking couple stared in the window of Vine, studied the menu, then wobbled off. Fifteen minutes later, bowing to the inevitable, they reappeared and took a table. I'm sure they had a perfectly good meal. I'm not so sure they made a mental note to retrace their steps in the near future.</p>
