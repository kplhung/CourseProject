        <p>IF you haven't been able to get a ticket to Bruce Springsteen's concerts at Madison Square Garden, here is what you've been missing. The Boss, after more than a year of careful analysis, has taken a position on the Amadou Diallo case. He has reached two bold conclusions:</p>
        <p>*It is a really bad idea for police officers to kill an innocent man.</p>
        <p>*It is a really, really bad idea if the killing involves multiple discharges of bullets.</p>
        <p>Are you clear on the second point? It's very important. Mr. Springsteen doesn't want you to miss it. At his opening concert Monday night, he sang ''41 shots'' nine straight times to start his new song, ''American Skin.'' He then repeated the refrain more than a dozen times as he went on to lament, ''You can get killed just for living in your American skin.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Springsteen did not specifically explain why it is worse to be killed with 41 shots than with one. But he is firmly on record against the extra bullets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Springsteen's supporters say that the song is not anti-police, but try telling that to officers who were hoping the Diallo media circus was finally over. The police do not understand why the number of shots has always gotten so much more attention than other statistics, like the declining number of people killed by the police in recent years, and the relatively few times that New York officers fire their guns in comparison with officers in other cities.</p>
        <p>If the 41 shots demonstrated anything, it was that the police who shot Mr. Diallo in the Bronx were genuinely confused and frightened -- you do not need to fire 41 shots if you're executing someone in cold blood whom you know to be unarmed. The fusillade was evidence not of murder, but of a tragic accident, as a jury eventually concluded by acquitting the four officers.</p>
        <p>But as soon as those 41 shots were reported on the news, the bullets and the officers became symbols of police misconduct. For critics of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's policies regarding race and the police, the four officers became the new public enemies -- never mind that those officers had not set the policies.</p>
        <p>During their year of vilification, culminating in a trial in an Albany courthouse with a mob outside chanting for their heads, the officers became figures you might expect Bruce Springsteen to sing about: working-class guys trying to do their jobs while oppressed by larger social forces. You might not have expected him to play to the mob.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Springsteen is no longer the poor Jersey kid singing about his blue-collar neighbors. He is a millionaire who doesn't have to hitchhike on Route 9 anymore. The singer who once defended Vietnam veterans and Middle American values has lately been focused on conventional liberal causes, like homelessness and AIDS.</p>
        <p>BESIDES his current anthem against police brutality, he has been crusading to preserve affirmative action programs, not exactly a popular cause in his old neighborhoods. The singer who recorded ''Greetings From Asbury Park'' seems to have made an ideological crossing of the Hudson: ''Greetings From Central Park West.''</p>
        <p>Well, he has every right to be conventional. But he's misleading his audiences if he leaves them with the impression that New York's police officers are a bunch of trigger-happy cowboys.</p>
        <p>Most officers enjoy inaction as much as anyone else. They know the golden rule of bureaucracy: you can't get in trouble for what you don't do. In the pre-Giuliani era, a police chief once estimated, only 25 percent of the officers did their jobs. Mr. Giuliani's great feat, the chief explained, was raising that figure to 50 percent.</p>
        <p>Some of those officers have undoubtedly gone back to their old ways since the vilification of the Diallo officers, and Mr. Springsteen's song is not going to do anything for their morale. It's impossible to know how their inactivity is affecting the crime rate, but there are a few worrisome signs.</p>
        <p>Last year the number of people arrested in New York for gun possession declined by 15 percent. Meanwhile, the number of homicides rose 6 percent, ending a six-year decline, and it has continued to rise. So far this year, there's been a 6 percent increase over last year in the rate of both homicides and shootings.</p>
        <p>Last weekend's mayhem, in which 6 people were killed during 40 attacks throughout the city, brought the year's homicide toll to 313 people, 17 more than at this time last year. The Boss didn't sing about any of them, but they were living in their American skins, too.</p>
