        <p>WINKLER-Franz, in New York City on June 12, 2000 at age 90. Survived by his wife, Marianne Winkler, his daughters, Naomi Rosenfeld and Daniela Winkler, and his grandchildren, Kathryn and Elizabeth Rosenfeld, and Eli and Peter Martin. Funeral service on Thursday, June 15 at 11:30 A.M., the Beth-El Chapel at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Leo Baeck Institute, 129 E. 73rd Street, New York City.</p>
        <p>WINKLER-Franz. The Officers and Trustees of the Leo Baeck Institute are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend Franz, for many years the Intitute's Vice President and Honorary Vice President. His devotion to our work and his support of the Institute's mission of preserving the rich heritage of German-speaking Jewry never diminished. His appreciation of the LBI's research library and archives reflected his love of learning and respect for scholarship. He upheld our highest traditional values without ever discouraging our new initiatives. Franz Winkler was a wonderful, thoughtful, and highly regarded Officer of the Leo Baeck Institute. Most of all, he was a genuine friend. Our heartfelt condolances to his dear wife Marianne, to his children and his grandchildren. Ismar Schorsch, President, LBI Carol Kahn Strauss, Exec. Dir.</p>
        <p>WINKLER-Franz. Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York expresses to the family of our devoted member, Franz Winkler, our deepest sympathies on the occassion of his passing. It is our hope and prayer that beautiful memories will linger as a legacy to his life. May all who loved him be comforted. Robert A. Bernhard, Pres. Herbert C. Bernard, Secretary</p>
