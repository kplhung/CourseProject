        <p>Pathmark Stores, once considered a top contender to build northwestern Harlem's largest supermarket, says it has pulled out of the running for a 45,000-square-foot project that city officials had hoped would be the catalyst for redevelopment along West 145th Street.</p>
        <p>The city-appointed development group Related Companies has told other candidates for the project that it is negotiating a contract with another large chain, ShopRite Supermarkets.</p>
        <p>Officials at Related Companies, which is based in New York, and ShopRite's parent company, Wakefern Food Corporation, in Middleton, N.Y., did not return repeated calls for comment.</p>
        <p>A senior vice president of Pathmark, Harvey Gutman, said yesterday that ''the current structure of the project, in our view, is not appropriate for the neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>The decision also comes as Pathmark deals with a failed merger with Royal Ahold, an aggressive Dutch retailer, and a decision, under mounting debt, to file for Chapter 11 under the bankruptcy law. But the company said that pulling out of the project had nothing to do with financial difficulties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gutman said that last month Pathmark, which is based in Carteret, N.J., had notified Related Companies of concerns about inadequate parking space and public transportation and about the size and cost of the project, including rent, which industry officials said would be a hefty $30 a square foot.</p>
        <p>''Given the location and the nature of the community needs, the site is much more appropriate for a smaller supermarket,'' Mr. Gutman said, referring to locally owned markets that had also been vying for the city-owned site.</p>
        <p>Faced with choosing between a large supermarket chain like Pathmark and the independent grocers, the city's Department of Housing, Preservation and Development last year awarded the project to Related, which now has the responsibility of selecting a market.</p>
        <p>Independent grocers have feared they would suffer if a large chain was granted the site, and some community leaders said they hoped it was not too late to persuade developers to choose a local merchant.</p>
        <p>Anthony Spencer, a member of the Bradhurst Community Business Alliance, said that the community would oppose ShopRite.</p>
        <p>''We are going to try to block them because the mayor only has 18 months left in office,'' Mr. Spencer said. ''We're just going to let it languish, killing it by letting things run down to the wire.''</p>
