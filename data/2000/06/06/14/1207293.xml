        <p>Hoping to expand its international communications network, Global Crossing Ltd. of Bermuda, the upstart communications carrier, has recently entered discussions to acquire Equant N.V. of the Netherlands, people close to the talks said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Equant, which controls perhaps the world's most geographically extensive communications network, remains in merger talks with France Telecom, France's dominant communications provider. But on Friday, an exclusivity period that France Telecom had negotiated for those talks expired, according to people close to the discussions, opening the door for Global Crossing to express its interest in Equant.</p>
        <p>As of yesterday, Global Crossing's discussions with Equant were ''very, very preliminary,'' according to one person close to the companies. But Global Crossing has demonstrated that it can move quickly and decisively, as when it ceded U S West Inc. to Qwest Communications International last year. Global's executive suite is stocked with experienced deal makers including Gary Winnick and Leo Hindery, and Global Crossing can be expected to maneuver more nimbly than can France Telecom.</p>
        <p>It was unclear yesterday just how much France Telecom or Global Crossing would be willing to pay for Equant. After The Wall Street Journal reported the talks yesterday, the Equant shares registered in New York rose $6.75, to $49.125, on the New York Stock Exchange, giving it a market value of $9.9 billion.</p>
        <p>As recently as February, Equant had a market value of more than $26 billion and its shares traded as high as $126.5625. But as it announced financial results for the first quarter, it revealed a bloated cost structure and said it was feeling pricing pressure as many other companies have moved into Equant's business of providing international network services. The announcement prompted several analysts to downgrade the stock, leading to the sell-off.</p>
        <p>While the recent struggles have certainly made Equant less expensive, they have not tarnished the company's fundamental attraction: its peerless international communications network, which reaches more than 220 nations.</p>
        <p>Equant's network is so extensive because it emerged from a consortium that included many of the world's biggest airlines, which use the network to tie together their reservation and communications systems. That consortium was formed in 1949 with the participation of KLM, Trans World Airlines, Air France and the predecessors of British Airways and SAS, among others. In 1995, the consortium agreed to sell 30 percent of its communications operation to Morgan Stanley's investing operation, and in 1998 the unit first sold stock to the public.</p>
        <p>The airlines are still major customers of Equant, but the company is also moving into the highly competitive market for selling complete international communications packages to big multinational companies. In many ways, Equant's geographic reach gives it a leg up in that sector. But while many people in the communications business -- including those at Equant's competitors -- acknowledge that Equant probably has the world's most extensive network, the quality and capacity of that network have been questioned.</p>
        <p>But those questions have not deterred either France Telecom or Global Crossing. After France Telecom's international Global One venture with Deutsche Telekom of Germany and the Sprint Corporation imploded last year, France Telecom ended up buying out its two partners. Linking Equant's network with what remains of Global One would give the French company a strong position as it battles other global communications players including the Concert joint venture of AT&amp;T and British Telecommunications, WorldCom, Deutsche Telekom and Cable and Wireless P.L.C. of Britain.</p>
        <p>Shares of Global Crossing fell 6.25 cents, to $28.5625, while France Telecom fell 3 euros, to 158.</p>
