        <p>Declaring that shopping malls have replaced downtowns as public forums, the New Jersey Supreme Court said yesterday that the malls must be careful not to restrict free speech by making it too difficult for  political and nonprofit groups to distribute leaflets there.</p>
        <p>In a unanimous decision, the court reversed a lower-court ruling that allowed the Mall at Mill Creek in Secaucus to require that groups have an insurance policy to distribute information in the mall. Green Party of New Jersey lawyers argued that the insurance cost was prohibitive to a small group like the Green Party.</p>
        <p>''Leafleting in heavily visited shopping areas has a very high value in our system of political discourse,'' the court said, in an opinion written by Associate Justice Daniel O'Hern. ''Putting too high a price on the exercise of that freedom may destroy it.''</p>
        <p>The decision was much anticipated by legal experts, because it is one of the first on a free-speech issue from a court now dominated by appointees of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. ''I think this says that this court is going to continue the tradition of being a strong proponent of freedom of expression, especially for grass-roots organizations that don't have the money for media advertising and direct mail,'' said Frank Askin, a lawyer from the Rutgers Law School Constitutional Litigation Clinic who argued the case for the Green Party.</p>
        <p>The case began in September 1996, when James Mohn of Guttenberg, N.J., a member of the New Jersey Draft Nader for President Committee, requested space for an information table at the mall to support the consumer advocate Ralph Nader. Mall officials told Mr. Mohn, who later helped form the New Jersey  Green Party, that among other things, his group would have to provide proof of insurance, which would have cost the group $665, and that it could leaflet for only one day each year. The Nader committee filed a lawsuit that was later pursued by the Green Party, saying such a requirements would have interfered with the group's First Amendment right to free speech.</p>
        <p>The court agreed yesterday with the party, although it preserved the rights of mall owners to place some ''reasonable'' restrictions on certain groups. But the mall, the court said, did not offer ''objective proof'' that the insurance requirement was reasonable. ''Throughout much of New Jersey today there is no place to go, other than shopping centers and regional malls, if one is to have an opportunity to meet face-to-face with large groups of people,'' Justice O'Hern wrote in the 45-page opinion.</p>
        <p>The opinion strengthens and clarifies a 1994 ruling in which the State Supreme Court said that private malls have a public role, but that they could place ''reasonable requirements'' on groups.</p>
        <p>Curtis L. Michael, the lawyer for Hartz Mountain Industries, which owns the mall, said he saw yesterday's decision as balancing rights to free speech and the mall's business concerns. Since the lawsuit was filed, the mall has let the Green Party to give out leaflets and offered groups  alternatives to the insurance requirement, like a $250 permit.</p>
