        <p>Earl T. Shinhoster, a senior official of the N.A.A.C.P. who served as its interim leader in the mid-1990's, died on Sunday in a auto accident near Montgomery, Ala. He was 49 and lived in Decatur, Ga.</p>
        <p>The Alabama State Police said Mr. Shinhoster was the passenger in a car that blew a tire and then hit a tree. The driver was listed in good condition yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shinhoster was the acting executive director and chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People for a year in 1995-96, helping it overcome years of turmoil and debts after the forced resignation of his predecessor, the Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr.</p>
        <p>He was succeeded by the present chief executive, Kweisi Mfume, a former United States representative from Maryland.</p>
        <p>At his death, Mr. Shinhoster was director of its People's Voter Empowerment program, a national educational and voter-registration project.</p>
        <p>A native of Savannah, Ga., he graduated with a degree in political science from Morehouse College. He started working for the N.A.A.C.P. as a teenager, stuffing envelopes and taking part in the sit-ins of the 1960's. Among the senior positions he held were southeastern regional director and national field secretary. This year he was working to ensure that African-Americans were properly counted in the 2000 Census.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shinhoster's survivors include his wife, Ruby, and a son, Michael, both of Decatur.</p>
