        <p>New York State lawmakers agreed to give annual cost-of-living pension increases for the first time to retired state and local government workers. The decision, affecting 1.7 million current and former employees, is projected to cost New York City more than $500 million a year.</p>
        <p>Powerful public employees' unions had pushed hard for the annual increases for years, arguing that most retired public workers collect pensions of less than $15,000 a year, even though pension funds have swelled with the robust stock market.</p>
        <p>City officials won concessions that reduced the costs of the pension agreement, but they were hesitant to say how the plan would affect $418 million in city tax cuts that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council had agreed on.</p>
