        <p>Jacob Lawrence, the American painter who died last week at 82, told his students: ''We all like headlines and that type of thing, but this shouldn't be confused with the real meaning of your work. In fact, I think an artist is most fortunate when he doesn't get too much attention. The so-called art movements usually come after the fact. If you're unfortunate enough to get swept up in a movement, then you'll find yourself following yourself.''</p>
        <p>Typical Lawrence. Straight, no pretense. Of course he was grateful for the headlines he got but never let them get to him. Which is kind of remarkable when you consider that he was already famous by his early 20's, after Fortune magazine reproduced his ''Migration'' series and the series toured the country.</p>

        <p>Jacob Lawrence, the American painter who died last week at 82, told his students: ''We all like headlines and that type of thing, but this shouldn't be confused with the real meaning of your work. In fact, I think an artist is most fortunate when he doesn't get too much attention. The so-called art movements usually come after the fact. If you're unfortunate enough to get swept up in a movement, then you'll find yourself following yourself.''</p>
        <p>Typical Lawrence. Straight, no pretense. Of course he was grateful for the headlines he got but never let them get to him. Which is kind of remarkable when you consider that he was already famous by his early 20's, after Fortune magazine reproduced his ''Migration'' series and the series toured the country.</p>
        <p>He also knew what he was talking about when he dismissed art movements. He never belonged to any, not consciously anyway, sticking to a style for 60 years while the art world changed around him. That meant he got a few pokes in the eye from people who thought he should be more strident, despite his deep and obvious devotion to civil rights.</p>
        <p>But his independence from cliques artistic and political -- I think it had to do with his shyness combined with his desire never to turn off anyone by dividing people into camps -- this independence paid off. The work -- compassionate, formally streamlined and essentially simple -- outlasted any passing debates about whether he was sufficiently confrontational in his life or in his art.</p>
        <p>Being simple was complicated, as Lawrence liked to say. Once, talking about one of his favorite paintings, Sassetta's ''Journey of the Magi'' in the Metropolitan Museum, he explained: ''We say 'simplicity' and imply something's easy to accomplish, but this isn't easy. It's a highly refined composition, and I could describe why formally, the way the shapes balance one another, the way the image moves from dark to light. But there's something that I can't describe formally, which is a certain feeling, an intuitiveness, maybe. An emotional authenticity.'' And that describes his own work in a nutshell. His art dealt with black heroes or the common black people whose lives he showed to be heroic. It was history painting that hadn't been done before. But it was also at heart about telling universal stories bigger than any particular man or movement. It illustrated dignity through struggle. That was one big reason his iconic, abstract style touched so many different sorts of people.</p>
        <p>Another reason was simply that it's joyful. It's easy to make political art that's polemical, grandiose and rebarbative. Lawrence went another route. I can't think of another American artist of his generation whose works, even the ones that tell tragic stories, are at the same time so true, so modest and so filled with a basic love.</p>
        <p>In recounting some of the worst episodes of our past, Lawrence found redemption through art, and he made us see it, too, so that we come away feeling fortified, not embittered, which is an amazing feat. The pleasure he had painting translates directly into the pleasure we get from looking at what he did.</p>
        <p>A few years ago I spent a couple of days wandering around the Met and the Modern with him and his wife, the painter Gwendolyn Knight. They got to know each other when they were teenagers and married in 1941. She is a strong woman and a strong artist who seems even more self-effacing than he was, if that's possible. He depended on her eye, and together they shared a warm, genial sense of humor and a lifetime of experience.</p>
        <p>They had flown in from Seattle, where they had moved in 1970 when he took a teaching post at a university there. Longtime New Yorkers, they had lived in Harlem, then Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, with an interlude in Nigeria, before moving west. The 60's had been transitional years for Lawrence. He was being criticized by younger, more radical blacks. He was well known but still needed to teach to make a living. In the mid-60's the couple had decided to make a new life in Nigeria and even sold their place in Bedford-Stuyvesant, then found Africa wasn't right for them. So they returned after eight months.</p>
        <p>Lawrence loved teaching in Seattle, but since he had retired in 1986, he told me, they had both fantasized about returning to New York. Seattle was fine, he insisted (he would never say anything bad about anyone or anything, ever, at least publicly), but he allowed that it was different being in New York, in the middle of things.</p>
        <p>You could tell that the two of them enjoyed the city. It was obvious from how he reminisced about Harlem and Stieglitz's American Place gallery and going to Horn &amp; Hardart's to argue about art over coffee and a nickel slice of pie.</p>
        <p>He also talked about having moved in 1930 with his mother from Philadelphia to Harlem, hearing Adam Clayton Powell Sr. deliver sermons in the Abyssinian Baptist Church, seeing Aaron Douglas's mural ''Aspects of Negro Life'' at the 135th Street public library and meeting Langston Hughes along with the philosopher and impresario Alain Locke and the sculptor Augusta Savage: icons of the Harlem Renaissance to whom Lawrence was one of the last great artistic links.</p>
        <p>Savage got him into the W.P.A. Federal Art Project. It gave him materials, a studio and $23.86 a week, a big deal during the Depression, especially for a young black man. He said he started to use egg tempera at the time ''because I liked its translucence, and it was easy to use, and besides I could buy a jar with a dime.'' He laughed. ''People respected the subjects I was doing, like Harriet Tubman, John Brown. They said, 'He's producing something of value, even though he doesn't really know what he's doing.' '' He laughed again.</p>
        <p>He was influenced by Ben Shahn, Picasso, Stuart Davis, Arthur Dove, African sculpture, the Katzenjammer Kids, Maggie and Jigs and the movies, high and low: he was open to almost everything, which maybe had to do with his being outside the usual art circles, so not bound by conventions.</p>
        <p>From this he developed a technique of narrative, a sense of drama and a repertory of emblematic shapes. As the three of us went through the museums, he picked out one painter after another, all different kinds, who had meant something special to him when he was young, including Jose Clemente Orozco, the Mexican muralist.</p>
        <p>With Orozco, he said, ''you had both content and form, social content and abstract form.'' Orozco taught him to be spontaneous and direct. After meeting Orozco, he added, he was so grateful for the advice he had received that he bought a bag of cherries on the street to bring back as a gift. It was a typical little Lawrence story, very human.</p>
        <p>His wife pushed his wheelchair, when he agreed to be in it, which wasn't much of the time. He had various health problems in later years, lung cancer at the end. But he was still working as late as last week. If he didn't work, he told people, he might as well be dead.</p>
        <p>Beneath the soft exterior, there was toughness, not to mention pride, although the exterior could be pretty thick. He was a product of his generation. Even after a loosening couple of glasses of wine at lunch, and no matter how much I protested, he wouldn't quit addressing me as Mr. Kimmelman, which seemed awkwardly formal considering how informal and open he was about himself, never mind that I was half his age.</p>
        <p>But that was him, courtly, solicitous, incredibly forgiving in his professional life. When he was young and going to art galleries in New York, ''no one would keep you out, but it wasn't hospitable,'' he recalled at one point. ''You knew you were being watched. You learned to live with it.''</p>
        <p>We were in the Met at that moment, and a guard suddenly came up to him. The guard stuck out his hand. He said Lawrence's work had always meant so much to him that he just wanted to say thank you.</p>
