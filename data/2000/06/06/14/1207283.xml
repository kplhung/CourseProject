        <p>Generous work incentives in Minnesota for welfare enrollees have produced startling results, according to a study just released by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation of New York. The number of families living solely on welfare benefits fell about 20 percent. Employment rates among single parents rose by about 35 percent and income rose 15 percent. In other states, the income of enrollees who go to work often falls as welfare benefits are withdrawn.</p>
        <p>The biggest surprise, however, was a 40 percent increase in marriage rates among two-parent families -- calming fears that generous welfare benefits would encourage couples to split up. Under the program, domestic abuse fell 18 percent and school performance among children improved. No other state has achieved anything like these results.</p>

        <p>The biggest surprise, however, was a 40 percent increase in marriage rates among two-parent families -- calming fears that generous welfare benefits would encourage couples to split up. Under the program, domestic abuse fell 18 percent and school performance among children improved. No other state has achieved anything like these results.</p>
        <p>The key to Minnesota's success is the combination of a work requirement with generous cash benefits -- up to $250 a month more than the old welfare program -- plus child-care assistance and support for enrollees after they find work. The program makes sure that enrollees who work come out ahead financially and that they know that work will raise their incomes.</p>
        <p>A single study can be misleading. But a Canadian welfare experiment similar to Minnesota's appears to be generating similarly positive effects on income, poverty and children. Two tentative lessons emerge. States that boast about cutting welfare rolls might also start thinking about raising family incomes. Second, welfare reform might cut down divorce and help children. But these outcomes may only be possible if states spend more on welfare and make sure that enrollees know that playing by the new rules will leave them better off.</p>
