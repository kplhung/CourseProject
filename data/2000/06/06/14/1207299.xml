        <p>Each time the United States Open has come to Pebble Beach, the spectacular setting has been a catalyst for sensational play.</p>
        <p>In 1972, Jack Nicklaus won the tournament, hitting the flagstick at No. 17 on Sunday with a remarkable 1-iron tee shot. In 1982, Tom Watson won a final-round battle against Nicklaus with a chip-in for birdie at No. 17 on his way to a two-stroke victory. And in 1992, Tom Kite won his only major by playing one of the best final rounds, shooting an even-par 72 in a 35-mile-an-hour wind.</p>

        <p>Each time the United States Open has come to Pebble Beach, the spectacular setting has been a catalyst for sensational play.</p>
        <p>In 1972, Jack Nicklaus won the tournament, hitting the flagstick at No. 17 on Sunday with a remarkable 1-iron tee shot. In 1982, Tom Watson won a final-round battle against Nicklaus with a chip-in for birdie at No. 17 on his way to a two-stroke victory. And in 1992, Tom Kite won his only major by playing one of the best final rounds, shooting an even-par 72 in a 35-mile-an-hour wind.</p>
        <p>Starting with Thursday's opening round, Pebble Beach will once again provide a picturesque backdrop that will force players to be patient, creative and resilient. It will also force the winner to play brilliant golf. This week's practice rounds have only reinforced the message. Play well, and one of golf's ultimate prizes could be your reward; play poorly, and you could be embarrassed.</p>
        <p>''You're not going to win this tournament playing mediocre golf,'' Watson, who will be playing in his 29th Open, said. ''The way the course is set up, it's more difficult than it has been in the past. The fairways are a little bit more narrow. The rough is very difficult.''</p>
        <p>''I can't hit it out of the rough on this golf course unless I get lucky,'' Tiger Woods said.</p>
        <p>The rough has been the main topic of conversation during this week's practice rounds. It is four and one-half inches high and extremely thick. Initially, the United States Golf Association planned to keep the rough at three and one-half inches, but at that height U.S.G.A. officials did not think it was enough of a challenge. It is now. But not every ball that enters the rough will be buried.</p>
        <p>''Some disappear, some get half buried, others sit out,'' said Tim Moraghan, the U.S.G.A. executive who helped set up the course. ''It's the luck of the draw. And you know, you're supposed to hit the fairways anyway.''</p>
        <p>Even for those who drive the ball well, the course will be far more difficult than it was in February, when Woods won the Pebble Beach AT&amp;T National Pro-Am by shooting 15 under par in damp conditions. The fairways are faster and the greens are much harder. Many players believe an over-par score will win Sunday. It has not rained here since last week, and today and Monday were picture-perfect days with midday temperatures in the high 60's and low 70's.</p>
        <p>If the weather remains dry, the already firm greens will be rock hard by Thursday, making it difficult to get any approach shots close to the pin.</p>
        <p>''There's probably going to be about six or seven greens where I won't even try to hit them, if you can imagine that,'' said Phil Mickelson, a three-time winner this year, who will be seeking his first major championship. ''The greens are so small and so hard, there are a couple that are virtually impossible to keep the ball on the surface. With the greens this small, they weren't designed to be this firm.</p>
        <p>''I will probably try to leave it 20 or 30 yards short of some greens, so I have uphill chips. I feel I can get those up and down. That's where I'm going to take advantage of my short game.''</p>
        <p>As if breaking par were not already difficult enough, the 484-yard second hole, which used to be a par 5, has been made a par 4 for this tournament. Most players were not happy about it.</p>
        <p>''We've always played this golf course at par 72,'' Woods said. ''All of a sudden, we make it par 71. I don't think that's right. Now, we can't really compare all the champions.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the par-3, 188-yard No. 5 was completely redesigned by Nicklaus last year, and most players like this new version, which features a small green, perched near an ocean cliff. A good tee shot can lead to a birdie. A poor tee shot can lead to an easy bogey.</p>
        <p>But the biggest factor this week could be the wind. If the conditions remain calm, more players will have a realistic chance to win. But the wind can pick up at Pebble Beach faster than a fireman changes his clothes. Blustery conditions will weed out anyone who is not striking the ball extremely well. Sounds like a demanding week. Sounds like conditions made for a United States Open.</p>
        <p>''We're all very excited to be at Pebble Beach,'' Mickelson said. ''But the golf course is going to provide a difficult test.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>There will be a half-hour memorial service Wednesday at 7 a.m. Pacific time on the 18th hole to honor Payne Stewart, last year's United States Open champion, who was killed in a plane crash last October. Players will line up on the 18th hole and simultaneously hit shots into the Pacific Ocean. TRACEY STEWART, Stewart's widow, will attend. ''I think we need to honor the defending champion and the man himself, PAUL AZINGER, one of Stewart's closest friends on tour, said. ''I think the majority of us are still in disbelief that Payne Stewart is not here. Everybody will deal with the situation differently. Personally, I don't ever want to totally stop thinking about it, because it helps prioritize things in my life. I don't ever want to forget the guy.''</p>
