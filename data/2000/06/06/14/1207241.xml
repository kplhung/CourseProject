        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your continuing series ''How Race Is Lived in America'' (front page, June 4, 5, 7 and 11) provides considerable insight into America's racial conundrum. Over the last several decades, the nation has made real progress in combating racial injustice. Yet racism, though now in a more latent state, still survives. Efforts to improve race relations have shifted from a formal, organized civil rights movement to interpersonal engagement.</p>

        <p>While the focus is no longer on fighting legal discrimination, the terrible burden of battling racism continues to fall heaviest on individual blacks. Americans of good will are able to understand the resulting frustration expressed by African-Americans. What all Americans must understand ultimately is that unchecked racism undermines America's moral and competitive edge in the emerging global age.</p>
