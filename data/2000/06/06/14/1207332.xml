        <p>Re ''Death Sentences Being Overturned in 2 of 3 Appeals'' (front page, June 12):</p>
        <p>You report that a new study has found that in capital-case appeals, 68 percent of death penalty sentences have been reversed because of misconduct or procedural errors by the police, prosecutors, defense lawyers or bias by the judge or jury.</p>
        <p>But it is important to note that juries' factual errors -- for example, the decision to believe a mistaken eyewitness -- are not included. Jurors' factual determinations are not reviewed on appeal. This is a crucial distinction.</p>
        <p>Even good defense lawyers are often helpless in the face of confident, sincere eyewitnesses. The appellate process does not reach these mistakes. Even if it were possible to correct all procedural infirmities, we would still be faced with the frailty of human memory.</p>

        <p>The writer is a criminal defense lawyer.</p>
