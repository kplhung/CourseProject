        <p>FOR those who can afford it, the Englishman's fish of choice has always been Dover sole. And the lucky ones who can afford it have always repaired to Wiltons to enjoy it.</p>
        <p>Well, not quite always. George Wilton didn't open for business until 1742, and for the first few decades the family establishment dealt mainly in oysters and shellfish. But for 150 years it has been famous for its superlative and now mortifyingly expensive sole ($38 grilled, fried or a la meuniere, with first course, vegetables and dessert extra).</p>
        <p>Situated in the heart of St. James's, London's clubland, Wiltons is rather clubby itself: discreet, masculine, unchanging, understated. But of course the food is vastly better, women are just as welcome as men, and business or political documents may be placed on the table or passed from hand to hand -- heinous activities that are forbidden at White's and the other tony clubs that thrive on the fiction that they exist only for social purposes.</p>
        <p>''It's a kind of business annex to White's,'' said Andrew Phillips, the general manager of Dukes, a small, quietly elegant hotel tucked into a tiny St. James's courtyard.</p>
        <p>Aristocrats, art dealers, city gents and political grandees constitute the clientele, along with ''businessmen, bankers and bounders,'' as a house history puts it. Many of the patrons have luxuriant hair, as if they had just left Trumper's, the top people's stylist just down the street.</p>
        <p>Sit on the little bench inside Wiltons's door at 55 Jermyn Street and listen to Robin Gundry, the pinstriped general manager, greet his customers at lunchtime: ''Good morning, my lord . . . Can I help, sir? . . . Do come this way . . . Won't keep you a minute . . . Oh, you are a star, sir. . . .''</p>
        <p>Rex Harrison liked to stay at the Ritz, right around the corner. In this part of town, he once said, every last want of a gentleman (or an actor impersonating a gentleman) could be attended to: ''I can walk to my tailor's in Jermyn Street, get my shirts from Turnbull &amp; Asser, Lobbs for my boots, Locks for my hats, Wiltons for a little fish, Berry Brothers for the booze, Hatchards for books, and George Trumper for my hair.''</p>
        <p>You might start with a half-dozen oysters. They will set you back $25, but then they are elegant creatures, five inches across, pale beige rather than silver-gray, in shells as flat as saucers. They come from West Mersea, on an island off the Essex coast, from beds that are harvested exclusively from rowboats, lest oil or gasoline pollute the waters. They are opened by London's best oysterman, Patrick Flaherty, a 37-year veteran. None of the briny juices escape. No nasty bits of shell creep in.</p>
        <p>That's the way it is at Wiltons. The point is the raw materials, not a saucier's legerdemain. The restaurant has bought its smoked salmon from the same East End supplier for 50 years, and the wet-fish merchants it deals with ''know exactly what we require,'' Mr. Gundry said, ''and know that we'll pay top price for it.''</p>
        <p>If you demand wild salmon from the River Spey in Scotland, rather than a flabby specimen from some fish farm in lord-knows-where, and grill it for exactly the requisite time, you need not be a culinary wizard.</p>
        <p>THE same thing is true of Dover sole. That would be Solea solea, a thick, white, meaty flatfish, not to be confused with the European lemon sole or the host of North American pretenders like flounder on the East Coast and petrale on the West. It is much firmer and sweeter than most of its cousins; its only real European rival is the lordly turbot.</p>
        <p>According to the 19th-century expert Francis Day, quoted by Alan Davidson in his new ''Oxford Companion to Food,'' the sole's name comes from the Greeks, who thought a fine one ''would form a fit sandal for an ocean nymph.''</p>
        <p>Dover sole runs as large as three or four pounds or more (the fishermen call those tombstones) and as small as six inches long (their nickname is tongues). The ideal eating size is about a pound, just big enough to feed one person amply. No matter what the size, they are white on the bottom, brown on the top, an elongated oval in shape with two eyes placed extremely close together on the darker side.</p>
        <p>In Escoffier's time, sole was subject to all manner of indignity. Fillets were the order of the day, their taste masked by preparations involving cheese (Mornay), crayfish (Nantua), mushrooms (bonne femme) and grapes and cream (Veronique, probably the best of the lot). Dozens upon dozens of recipes are paraded through the columns of the Larousse Gastronomique, but the Wiltons menu mentions only two of the fancier preparations -- sole Colbert, in which the fish is split open before deep-frying and the cavity then filled with herb butter, and sole Walewska, which involves cheese, mushrooms and lobster.</p>
        <p>That venerable standby sole meuniere (named in tribute to the floury hands of a miller's wife who, one day in the dim, distant past, prepared a fish to be sauteed in butter) is one of the favorites at Wiltons. But whole grilled sole is the overwhelming choice of English connoisseurs: brushed with melted butter, sprinkled with salt and pepper, turned quickly on the grill in such a way that the grill bars burn a dark lattice pattern into the fish, then cooked under the intense heat of the broiler for roughly 12 to 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>Perfectly simple, simply perfect and entirely sufficient. This is the porterhouse steak of fish. No sauce is needed, partly because cooking the fish whole (''on the bone'') helps to keep it moist. You may well come across an occasional apostate who insists upon tartar sauce (too robust, in my view) or hollandaise (too rich). A squirt of lemon is enough.</p>
        <p>''Nothing on this planet could possibly taste better,'' said Rick Stein, the British cookbook author and television chef, whose restaurant at Padstow in Cornwall faces out toward the Trevose Bank, a small corner of the North Atlantic that yields some of the very finest of Dover sole.</p>
        <p>''The grill and the sole are a match made in heaven,'' said William Black, another of the country's leading authorities on fish.</p>
        <p>Relatively few Dover sole are actually landed at Dover, the Channel port southeast of London. They come from ports in the West Country like Brixham and Padstow and Looe, from the North Sea or from Ireland. Mr. Stein says that good ones come from the Bay of Biscay, which lies between Brittany and Spain. But Dover was the main source in the 19th century, when sole came into fashion, and the name has stuck.</p>
        <p>Unlike most fish, which deteriorate rapidly once caught, sole tastes best when about three or four days old. Flippingly fresh, just out of the water, they are tough; like game, they improve with a bit of age. Therefore they can be successfully air-freighted across great distances. If they are shipped soon after they are caught, they land in New York or Tokyo fish markets in prime condition, unlike more fragile species like daurade and rouget. Which, of course, exponentially increases the demand for Dover sole and drives up the price; large quantities of sole are air-freighted every day from Amsterdam as well as London. At the Four Seasons in Manhattan, a plainly cooked Dover sole will set you back an elaborately garnished $46. Before too long, many British fishmongers predict, Dover sole will be as expensive as caviar.</p>
        <p>A certain amount of ceremony and tradition surround the eating of Dover sole in England -- and for that matter other kinds of seafood. Smoked salmon and oysters, for instance, are always served with thinly sliced, buttered brown bread. A grilled sole must be boned without turning the fish over, which is easier than it sounds; a nautical legend says that flipping the sole onto its back would cause the ship that caught it to capsize.</p>
        <p>But nothing quite matches the traditions of Wiltons itself -- dishes like mushy peas and bread and butter pudding and Arnold Bennett omelet, an unlikely concoction of smoked haddock, cream and Parmesan cheese.</p>
        <p>Service is provided by waiters in dark suits and waitresses in white nurses' uniforms (which, I have always supposed, is meant as a subliminal reminder to the customers that they are eating real nursery food). Nicholas Lander, the restaurant critic of The Financial Times, says Wiltons has much faster service than most other London restaurants, because ''board chairmen will bang the table if they're kept waiting.''</p>
        <p>The place belongs to the Hambros, a banking family, originally from Denmark. One evening in 1942 Olaf Hambro was eating oysters alone at the bar, when a bomb landed in Piccadilly, only a block or two away, shaking the restaurant and its proprietress, Bessie Leal. She folded her tea towel, unpinned her apron and announced, again according to the official Wiltons history, that she was going to close the place and head back to her native Cornwall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hambro made her an offer, which she accepted forthwith.</p>
        <p>''Put it on the bill,'' he said, and Mrs. Leal did just that.</p>
        <p>The next day, Mr. Hambro hired Jimmy Marks, the oysterman at Bucks Club, to run the place. He did so until his death in 1976, four days short of his 90th birthday; his widow, Lucille, took over for the next eight years.</p>
        <p>In those days, the restaurant had curtained booths for those who sought privacy, whether for needs of security or reasons of the heart. There are still curtains between some tables, but only a fool would expect to hide anything behind them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marks once told me toward the end of his life about packing hampers of food and carrying them himself to nearby St. James's Palace -- clandestine picnic suppers for the Prince of Wales and his mistress, Wallis Simpson. As an admirer observed, Mr. Marks was a bit like an oyster himself: ''hard shell, compact build, self-sufficient, a certain cool acidity.'' He feared no one.</p>
        <p>During the war, it is said by old-timers on the restaurant staff, Winston Churchill, a great devotee of oysters and caviar, visited Wiltons often. At one point, he let his bill run on for 18 months, until Mr. Marks approached the great man for payment.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Churchill, sir, I think your secretary must have overlooked your account,'' the redoubtable Mr. Marks said. Having held off the Nazis, Churchill was not about to be quickly bested by a maitre d'hotel.</p>
        <p>''Good heavens, Marks,'' he said. ''Didn't know you were hard up.''</p>
        <p>Another time, at the height of the I.R.A. bombings in London in the 1970's, a police inspector urged that the bar and front tables be cleared.</p>
        <p>''Nah,'' Mr. Marks replied, according to the house history. ''That there table is Lord Ashcombe's. If Lord Ashcombe wants his lunch there, Lord Ashcombe will have it there.''</p>
