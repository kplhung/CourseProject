        <p>George Steinbrenner stopped by the Yankee Stadium office of his manager and asked Joe Torre the same question that is reverberating around the city: what do you think about Sammy Sosa?</p>
        <p>But discussing the merits of the All-Star slugger is much different from hurdling all the obstacles to an actual trade. The Chicago Cubs would have to agree to trade Sosa -- something they do not appear close to doing yet -- and the Yankees would have to agree to give the Cubs what they want, and then the Yankees would have to negotiate a huge contract extension with Sosa when some of their own stars are unsigned.</p>
        <p>They came close to completing a seven-year, $118.5 million deal with Derek Jeter in January, but Steinbrenner never signed off on the package -- and Jeter's agent indicated yesterday that those negotiations are obsolete. Jeter is now six months closer to free agency and his price tag has presumably increased.</p>
        <p>''You negotiate a contract based on landscape that currently surrounds you,'' said Casey Close, Jeter's agent, who spoke in the context only of his client's negotiations, and not in light of the fact the Yankees might acquire and sign Sosa. ''Derek is further along in his career, further along in his development.''</p>
        <p>''If you're one week into the season, then maybe'' the old deal would be in place, Close said. ''But when you start getting into the middle of the season, you can't look at it the same way. It's a new landscape.''</p>
        <p>If Steinbrenner wants Sosa and all the fanfare that comes with him, Steinbrenner can probably make it happen -- at a huge cost, in payroll and prospects.</p>
        <p>The deal negotiated in the off-season would have paid Jeter about $17 million a year; he can be a free agent after the 2001 season. Bernie Williams, the Yankees' center fielder, has six years remaining (including this season) on a deal that pays him $12.5 million a year. The closer Mariano Rivera, making $7.2 million this year, will have another season of arbitration before he can become a free agent; if Rivera remains healthy and dominant, he will command a salary well in excess of $10 million.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have an understanding with Roger Clemens to give the right-hander a two-year extension after this year, for about $14 million to $15 million a year. That means that if the Yankees trade for Sosa and give him about $18 million to $20 million a year, they will be obligated to pay about $70 million to five players -- to say nothing about second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, owed a total of $30 million through the 2003 season, and Andy Pettitte's salary of about $8 million for each of the next two years.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner did not want a payroll larger than $100 million before this year -- and the payroll is at about $92 million now -- but if the Yankees get Sosa and keep the other stars, they could pass $125 million and possibly approach $150 million for the 2002 season.</p>
        <p>Club officials are exploring all the ramifications of a trade for Sosa.</p>
        <p>So far, the Cubs have not made specific proposals to the Yankees, and a baseball official for another team said Chicago might wait a couple of weeks before forwarding any names. What has been communicated is that it will take a lot to get Sosa.</p>
        <p>The Cubs would need something to anchor the trade, and the best available prospects in the Yankees' systems are shortstop Alfonso Soriano, currently in Class AAA, and third baseman Drew Henson, playing for Class AA Norwich.</p>
        <p>But many scouts have serious doubts about whether Soriano can play shortstop in the major leagues, and any team that trades for Henson must take the risk that Henson -- who will be the first-string quarterback for the University of Michigan in the fall -- may quit baseball after next fall and try to play in the National Football League. Henson signed with the Yankees in part because they are the Yankees; there is no telling how a trade might affect his feelings about baseball.</p>
        <p>Most of the Yankees' top minor league pitching is deep in the system, because of the struggles of Ryan Bradley and Ed Yarnall and others.</p>
        <p>The Yankees continue to explore other more conservative options, such as swapping for Juan Gonzalez of the Detroit Tigers and B. J. Surhoff of the Baltimore Orioles. The Tigers and the Yankees have not discussed specific trade proposals, and Detroit could always keep Gonzalez for the rest of the season and receive draft picks if he leaves as a free agent.</p>
        <p>''If somebody makes us a good offer, we'd always be willing to listen,'' said Randy Smith, the Tigers' general manager.</p>
        <p>Gonzalez told The Detroit Free Press last night: ''I'm not thinking about anything with my contract. I want to wait. I'm thinking about playing this year here.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees also are scouting the pitcher Hideo Nomo, who is 2-6 but has not won in seven different quality starts (six or more innings, three runs or fewer).</p>
        <p>Like Sosa, Gonzalez can veto any proposed trade to the Yankees. But while Gonzalez's status is being monitored by other teams, it is not generating the same intensity as Sosa's situation, which seems to be gathering momentum. Tom Reich, one of his agents, ''absolutely'' believes Sosa ''will be traded.''</p>
        <p>''I don't know to where,'' Reich said. ''But I believe he will be traded.''</p>
