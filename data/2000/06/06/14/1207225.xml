        <p>''The Woman Chaser'' was shown as part of last year's New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Stephen Holden's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 8, 1999. The film opens today at the Screening Room, 54 Varick Street, at Laight Street, TriBeCa.</p>
        <p>Maybe it's time for a moratorium on that most hackneyed of moviemaking concepts, the film-noir spoof. A comic subgenre that expresses an ironic longing for dark hidden worlds of corruption and evil that the show-and-tell culture of Jerry Springer has pretty much wiped out has been turned into a wearying film-school shtick.</p>
        <p>Even when it's carried off with some visual style, as it is in Robinson Devor's first feature, ''The Woman Chaser,'' film noir parody tends to feel stale and rehashed. The hard-boiled voice-over narration done mostly deadpan, the camera tilted sideways to evoke flaring tabloid photography, the churning 50's-style soundtrack of jittery bongo drums and slithery mambo beats: in the age of recombinant movie genres and parodies of parodies these film-noir touchstones have become cliches of cliches.</p>
        <p>To be a filmmaker nowadays, you have to be obsessed with the movies. The not-so-subtle joke of Mr. Devor's black-and-white movie, adapted from a pulp novel by Charles Willeford, is that its central character, Richard Hudson (Patrick Warburton), is so obsessed that he literally goes crazy writing and directing his first feature.</p>
        <p>''The Woman Chaser'' is set in 1950's Los Angeles, where Richard moves from San Francisco and immediately sets up a business as a shady used-car dealer. Tiring quickly of his job, he turns the lot over to an assistant (whom he instructs to hire several salesmen and dress them in Santa Claus suits in the middle of August) and starts writing his first movie, ''The Man Who Got Away.'' The relentlessly gloomy, hopelessly uncommercial picture tells the story of a truck driver who goes berserk, runs over a little girl and dies fending off a platoon of policeman.</p>
        <p>In making his film, Richard enlists the help of his father-in-law, Leo (Paul Malevich), a washed-up former film director whose sole possession of value is a Rouault painting of a clown that Leo clings to for sentimental value. Through Leo, Richard pitches his idea to the Man (Ernie Vincent), a scowling chief executive of Mammoth Pictures who unaccountably green-lights the project.</p>
        <p>Other kooky characters include Richard's mother (Lynette Bennett), a former ballerina who lures her hirsute lug of a son into a comic pas de deux with incestuous overtones; Richard's sexually curious stepsister, Becky (Marilyn Rising), who seduces him; and his secretary, Laura (Emily Newman), whom he impregnates with a boorish indifference.</p>
        <p>''The Woman Chaser'' strives desperately for a zaniness that is largely absent from the screenplay and from comic performances that are too blank and unfocused to register as parody.</p>
        <p>The exception is Mr. Warburton's Richard. The burly actor (familiar from ''Seinfeld'' as Elaine's boyfriend) gives Richard the deadly solidity of a slit-eyed Broderick Crawford-like brute while inflecting his performance with enough of a sly wink to let us know he's playing it for laughs.</p>
