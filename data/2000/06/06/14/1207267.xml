        <p>J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, a bank worth $21 billion, was disconnected from the Internet yesterday for failure to pay a $35 bill.</p>
        <p>The venerable Wall Street firm found itself without a Web site or an e-mail connection to the outside world because it had failed to renew the registration of www.jpmorgan .com, the domain name that serves as its address on the World Wide Web.

        <p>J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, a bank worth $21 billion, was disconnected from the Internet yesterday for failure to pay a $35 bill.</p>
        <p>The venerable Wall Street firm found itself without a Web site or an e-mail connection to the outside world because it had failed to renew the registration of www.jpmorgan .com, the domain name that serves as its address on the World Wide Web. Throughout the day, clients were unable to visit the Web site or exchange e-mail messages with the firm's bankers and traders.</p>
        <p>All that frustration could have been averted if Morgan had sent a check for $35 for the annual registration fee to Network Solutions, a domain-name registrar in Herndon, Va. It pulled the plug on Morgan six weeks after Morgan's bill came due and after sending the firm at least three bills, said Chris Clough, vice president for corporate communications at Network Solutions.</p>
        <p>A Morgan spokesman confirmed the disconnection but declined to discuss how it happened or how it would be resolved. He said he expected the Web site to be restored by today.</p>
        <p>The ''deactivation'' of a corporate Web site is ''a rare and isolated occurrence'' that can be avoided by paying for a 10-year registration of a domain name, Mr. Clough said. He said Morgan was never in jeopardy of losing the domain name, which it first registered eight years ago. The deletion of an entry from the worldwide registry is a step beyond deactivation, Mr. Clough said.</p>
        <p>The most embarrassing deactivation of a corporate domain name occurred late last year when Microsoft failed to renew the registration of a domain name critical to its Hotmail e-mail service. A computer consultant in Tennessee bailed out Microsoft by paying the $35 fee.</p>
        <p>''For $35, companies that are investing millions of dollars in their brands would do well to maintain their domain names,'' Mr. Clough said.</p>
