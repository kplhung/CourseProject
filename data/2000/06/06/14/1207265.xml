        <p>As was fitting for a writer whose defining work dealt with a paradox, the friends of Joseph Heller who paid tribute to him on Monday night repeatedly recalled a man whose gruff,  comic charm belied a deep, sophisticated intellect.</p>
        <p>''It always surprised me that this book of incredible complexity had been created by a guy who hung out at the local deli,'' said Mike Nichols, who directed the film version of Mr. Heller's classic 1961 novel, ''Catch-22.'' ''There were a lot of people who thought he found the manuscript on a dead soldier.'' The crowd laughed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heller died in December at 76, but his loss was still being keenly felt by many of the literary lights who gathered at the New York Society for Ethical Culture on West 64th Street.</p>
        <p>''The first time I saw Joseph Heller, I fell in love with him,'' said Art Cooper, the editor of GQ, echoing the famous first line of ''Catch 22'': (''It was love at first sight.'')</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper added: ''I wanted to be a writer like Joe Heller. One might just as well want to pitch like Sandy Koufax.''</p>
        <p>More often than not, friends spoke of Mr. Heller's remarkable talents -- and his capacity to amuse. ''He approached writing with the dignity of a workman,'' said the novelist and editor Christopher Buckley. ''I admired that courage to write.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buckley, who has edited Esquire and Forbes FYI, also recalled how he had once assigned Mr. Heller to write an article for him, despite Mr. Heller's protests that he was not made for that line of work.</p>
        <p>''It turned out he had the soul of a magazine writer,'' Mr. Buckley said. ''A true ability to eat at fine restaurants and stay in fine hotels on someone's dime. In this case, mine.''</p>
        <p>Other friends recalled Mr. Heller's  cantankerous -- and cutting -- side.</p>
        <p>''His ability to penetrate phoniness made him seem curmudgeonly, and he was curmudgeonly,'' said Frederick R. Karl, the biographer. ''But he insisted on honesty.''</p>
        <p>Bruce Jay Friedman, the novelist, said Mr. Heller's particular brand of candor was memorable.</p>
        <p>''It's one thing to not like Shakespeare,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''But to say it in public?''</p>
        <p>The tribute ended with remarks by Erica Heller-van den Boogaard, Mr. Heller's daughter, who showed a videotape assembled from home movies, intercut with some less famous quotations (''You call this a report card?'') from her father. The final image of the video, however, brought the largest applause.</p>
        <p>In it, Mr. Heller, young and smiling, thumbed his nose at the camera and laughed.</p>
