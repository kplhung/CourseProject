        <p>WE drive Interstate 95 between New York City and Charleston, S.C., frequently, and quickly. By minimizing pit stops and pushing speed limits, we can cross the George Washington Bridge at 6 in the morning and fit in a swim in the Atlantic in Charleston by sunset. But interstate travel is no picnic; for years, we survived on a convenience diet of hamburgers and gasoline fumes. And then we discovered the boxed lunches at Sally Bell's Kitchen, halfway between the two cities.</p>
        <p>Less than a mile from Virginia Exit 76 (A or B, depending on whether you're traveling south or north), Sally Bell's bakery is in an unassuming brick house in the shadow of a hospital in Richmond. The menu is a Smithsonian-worthy monument to the luncheon foods served in the South in the 1950's: country ham sandwiches, pimento cheese sandwiches, beaten biscuits, tomato aspic, pretty cupcakes and cheese wafers. Almost every element in a Sally Bell's lunchbox is made from scratch that morning, from the mayonnaise in the potato salad to the zest-flecked orange icing on the cupcake. And you can tell.</p>

        <p>WE drive Interstate 95 between New York City and Charleston, S.C., frequently, and quickly. By minimizing pit stops and pushing speed limits, we can cross the George Washington Bridge at 6 in the morning and fit in a swim in the Atlantic in Charleston by sunset. But interstate travel is no picnic; for years, we survived on a convenience diet of hamburgers and gasoline fumes. And then we discovered the boxed lunches at Sally Bell's Kitchen, halfway between the two cities.</p>
        <p>Less than a mile from Virginia Exit 76 (A or B, depending on whether you're traveling south or north), Sally Bell's bakery is in an unassuming brick house in the shadow of a hospital in Richmond. The menu is a Smithsonian-worthy monument to the luncheon foods served in the South in the 1950's: country ham sandwiches, pimento cheese sandwiches, beaten biscuits, tomato aspic, pretty cupcakes and cheese wafers. Almost every element in a Sally Bell's lunchbox is made from scratch that morning, from the mayonnaise in the potato salad to the zest-flecked orange icing on the cupcake. And you can tell.</p>
        <p>Even the prices at Sally Bell's seem preserved in amber: a standard boxed lunch, with a sandwich, a cupcake, potato or macaroni salad, half a deviled egg and a pecan-cheese wafer, is $5.30. A dozen Sally Lunn muffins, brioche-like pastries with a hint of sweetness, are $3.75.</p>
        <p>On a recent Tuesday, we found the usual pile-up of Richmond folks waiting their turn at the counter, a glass-enclosed Formica number that stretches the width of the room and displays cupcakes and tarts. Although the place is dimly lighted, the mood is merry, with greetings and Southern pleasantries exchanged across the counter as six women in white aprons hustle among cooling racks, shelves of premade wrapped sandwiches and the refrigerator that keeps aspics and salads chilled. Through the kitchen's open door, another group of women can be seen perched on stools icing cupcakes and mixing salads in stainless-steel bowls.</p>
        <p>Regulars rattle off their orders with easy confidence, but the staff lets novices like us take our sweet time. They understand that their menu involves tough decisions: What kind of sandwich? Potato or macaroni salad? What kind of cupcake?</p>
        <p>For the sandwich, there are 11 choices. Although we have now tried every one, we have yet to settle on a favorite. The egg salad is comfortingly homey, the whites and yolks hand cut and chunky as a gambler's dice. The Smithfield ham, with three paper-thin slices of salty country ham, is downright elegant.</p>
        <p>The exquisitely Cheddary pimento cheese spread has the variegated texture of hand-crumbled cheese with just a suggestion of red pepper heat. (Over the years, a few options have been sidelined; we're lobbying for the return of their perfectly calibrated ham spread, sweetened with ground raisins.) In most cases, the fillings are between slices of commercial white bread.</p>
        <p>Although the salad choice is simple -- the lively potato salad is the best we've ever tasted, loaded with onion and topped by a clovey sweet pickle slice -- there are eight standard cupcakes to choose from, including lemon, pineapple and devil's food with chocolate or mocha frosting.</p>
        <p>As you make your decisions, the counterwoman folds up the thin white cardboard box (printed in black with a cameo of a woman in ball gown and sash) and lines it with a blue-striped sheet of waxed paper that wraps around the contents. The paprika-dusted deviled egg is wrapped in its own waxed paper twist. Orders of more than one box are tied together into a stack with baker's twine to carry with one hand.</p>
        <p>Marcyne Jones, who owned and operated Sally Bell's from the 60's to the 80's and whose daughter-in-law Martha Crowe Jones now runs the store, says that what matters most is fidelity to the founder's recipes, handwritten and still kept on the original index cards.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Jones's aunt-in-law, the late Sarah  Cabell Jones, founded the original bakery across the street around 1924. It was a wholesaler before moving to its current site,  at 708 West Grace Street (804-644-2838). The bakery later opened to the public, and at some point in the 50's began boxing lunches.</p>
        <p>Sally Bell's is open Monday through Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. It usually takes from zero to two minutes to be served, then about a minute or two for each box to be assembled. Parking is alongside the building, so getting in and out is quicker than most McDonald's visits, but Sally Bell's does have one disadvantage: no restrooms.</p>
        <p>We don't know whether President Dwight D. Eisenhower, architect of the interstate highway system, planned I-95 to pass so close to Sally Bell's, but we thank him for it whenever we dig into our lunchboxes.</p>
        <p>PIMENTO CHEESE SPREAD  Adapted from Sally Bell's Kitchen  Time: about 15 minutes</p>
        <p>8 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, coarsely grated  2 ounces softened cream cheese, cut into pieces  3 tablespoons mayonnaise, preferably homemade  2 ounces pimentos (half a small jar), drained and chopped  1 teaspoon cayenne pepper.</p>
        <p>Combine Cheddar cheese and cream cheese in a bowl, and blend together with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Add mayonnaise, and continue blending. Add pimentos and cayenne, and mix until well distributed.</p>
        <p>Yield: 2 cups, enough for 4 large sandwiches.</p>
        <p>SOUTHERN HAM SPREAD  Adapted from Sally Bell's Kitchen  Time: about 15 minutes</p>
        <p>1/2 pound baked or boiled ham</p>
        <p>1/2 cup golden raisins  2 ounces softened cream cheese  3 tablespoons mayonnaise, preferably homemade  2 tablespoons sweet relish.</p>
        <p>Using a hand-operated or mechanical grinder, or a blender or food processor, grind ham and raisins separately. The texture should be almost a paste, not chunky. Mix both together in a bowl. Cut cream cheese into several pieces, and blend into the ham mixture along with the mayonnaise. Stir in the relish, and distribute well.</p>
        <p>Yield: 2 cups, enough for 4 sandwiches.</p>
