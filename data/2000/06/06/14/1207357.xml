        <p>Just when some doubt was creeping into the prospects for continued phenomenon status for ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' a contestant comes through who knows that Isaac Newton does not have a chemical element named after him.</p>
        <p>That was the question that enabled Bob House, a 36-year-old high school history teacher from Gay, Ga., to walk home with $1 million last night, the fourth millionaire within 10 months created by the ABC game show. (The other choices he was offered: Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and Enrico Fermi.)</p>
        <p>The timing was certainly welcome for ''Millionaire,'' which for the last two weeks has seen its status as prime-time juggernaut dented by the CBS newcomer ''Survivor.'' Not only did ''Survivor'' prove impervious to ''Millionaire'' magic when it faced it head-to-head the past two weeks, ''Survivor'' wound up beating the show soundly last Wednesday. That led to some whispers among television and advertising executives that ABC might be depending far too much on ''Millionaire'' to prop up the entire network: the show is expanding to four nights a week next fall.</p>
        <p>But Mr. House's timely windfall may help stem the tide of quibbling. The big winners have come at almost regular intervals for the show. The first, John Carpenter, burst through last November, just as ABC was deciding whether to expand the show to a weekly series from its original status of occasional event program.</p>
        <p>The second millionaire was Dan Blonsky; he furthered that move to a regular series by winning in mid-January, the first month the show was on three times a week. Joe Trela, the third big winner, popped up in mid-March, one night before a special Oscar-related edition of the game.</p>
        <p>But as Mr. House pointed out yesterday, even though he was lucky enough to be asked quite a few questions related to history and geography, ''the area I know really well,'' nothing could guarantee that he would answer the final question correctly, or that he would be willing to risk losing thousands on that question if he wasn't entirely sure of the answer.</p>
        <p>Indeed, what has distinguished the American edition of what has become a worldwide hit is the number of millionaire winners. Of the more than 70 that broadcast the game show, only two aside from the United States, South Africa and Portugal, have produced even one contestant who went for and got the big prize (50 million escudos in Portugal; 1 million rand in South Africa.) In Britain, where the show originated, no one has ever won 1 million [pounds].</p>
        <p>Mr. House said the willingness of Americans to gamble big might be a key factor. ''Americans live on the edge,'' he said. ''That's why we're the only superpower in the world.''</p>
        <p>He only had trouble with one question, worth $32,000, asking in what subject the author Suze Orman specialized. ''I have never heard of her,'' Mr. House said. So he asked the audience for help. More than 60 percent knew her topic was personal finance.</p>
        <p>For $250,000, he had no doubt at all that in 1989, the playwright Vaclav Havel became the president of Czechoslovakia (not Ukraine, Poland or Lithuania.) And for $500,000 he did not hesitate when asked what the six flags in the Six Flags amusement park chain stood for: governments of Texas (correct), pioneer trails, classic roller coasters, or Native American tribes.</p>
        <p>On his final question, Mr. House, whose wife, Sheila, teaches science, said he was pretty sure it was Isaac Newton. Since he had two lifelines left he narrowed it to two choices, Einstein and Newton, then called a science teacher, who said he was 100 percent sure Newton was correct.</p>
        <p>Mr. House said that his wife planned to buy a new car and that they would set aside a chunk of the money to send their two children to college. He also said he planned to continue to watch ''Millionaire.'' As for ''Survivor,'' Mr. House said, ''I think I saw part of one episode.''</p>
