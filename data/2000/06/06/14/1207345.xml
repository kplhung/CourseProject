        <p>Roger Clemens confirmed that he was pitching against Pedro Martinez and the Red Sox today, he claimed that having one extra day of rest will not make a difference and then he reminded reporters that he does not do interviews on the day before he starts.</p>
        <p>After Monday night's game was rained out, the Red Sox kept their rotation intact with Brian Rose pitching the game last night and Martinez starting today. The Yankees kept Orlando Hernandez in line to pitch last night, but they bumped Clemens ahead of Ramiro Mendoza to set up today's tasty rematch, only 17 days after the memorable meeting at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>''We had divine intervention for it,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ''I'm looking forward to it. Pedro is a day's work, no question. Hopefully, Roger can match him like the last time.''</p>
        <p>Actually, Roger almost matched Pedro the last time. Trot Nixon ended an electrifying pitcher's duel when he clubbed a two-run homer off Clemens in the ninth inning to carry the Red Sox to the 2-0 victory. Clemens and Martinez had been tremendous for the first eight innings and Roger, the former Red Sox icon, might have been superior to Pedro, the current Red Sox icon.</p>
        <p>Clemens struck out 13 to Martinez's 9 on a night he continually pumped his fastball while pitching with a purpose. Clemens lost, but he received immense praise for a gutsy performance against the best pitcher in the American League and the pitcher who has essentially replaced.</p>
        <p>Torre boldly said that he hoped all of the questions about Clemens, and there have been dozens since he was acquired from the Blue Jays for David Wells and two others in February 1999, would vanish. But they did not. Instead, Clemens has allowed 15 runs in 10 innings since nearly duplicating Martinez with a two-hitter, creating even more questions.</p>
        <p>''When you see him do what he did against Pedro, it looked like he was very much in control,'' Torre said. ''He just had a plan and it worked very effectively. When I saw that, there's no reason not to think he's got things in place. Maybe that's one reason I got frustrated myself when we were in Atlanta.''</p>
        <p>Torre criticized Clemens and four other players after the Yankees tumbled to a sluggish 11-7 loss to the Braves on June 3. The manager chastised the five-time Cy Young award winner who had been so dominant against the Red Sox after he gave up six runs in five innings in Atlanta six days later.</p>
        <p>The stern words did not help Clemens, who was also stung for nine runs in losing to the Mets, 12-2, last Friday. Clemens had handled Mike Piazza with six straight fastballs before throwing a flat slider that Piazza ripped for a grand slam. Piazza said that he was not looking for breaking ball, but it acted like he was. The pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre said that he spotted something specific on videotape that might have helped tip off the Mets to what Clemens was throwing. One person who has seen Clemens pitch regularly theorized that it was the speed of Clemens's leg kick, very fast or very slow, which might have helped the Mets guess whether to expect a fastball or a breaking ball.</p>
        <p>Usually, Torre is cautious as he discusses Clemens. He admitted yesterday that he is more of an observer then a hands-on manager to Clemens because there is little he could say to help a future Hall of Fame pitcher. But Torre has mentioned on numerous occasions that Clemens has a stellar fastball and that he must throw his best pitch more routinely. Clemens did that against Martinez and the Red Sox 17 days ago, which is something Torre should not have to remind him about.</p>
        <p>''He may be making adjustments before he needs to,'' Torre said. ''To me, his fastball is still very, very much alive and the velocity has been good. I think he's probably making pitching tougher than it looks like it should be. You know, trying to do a lot of things that he doesn't need to try and do yet.''</p>
