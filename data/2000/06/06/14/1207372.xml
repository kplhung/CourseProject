      <abstract>
        <p>Correction of June 12 article and June 13 editorial on death penalty appeals: Supreme Court began to reinstate revised versions of death penalty in 1976</p>
      </abstract>
    </body.head>
    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Monday article and the editorial also misstated the year that the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty. After overturning death penalty laws in 1972, the court began to reinstate revised versions in 1976. Some that were approved by the court had been redrafted in 1973, but the court did not reinstate the penalty that year.</p>
        <p>The Monday article included an erroneous percentage from a draft of the study, for capital cases in which state courts found error. It was 47 percent, not 46.</p>
