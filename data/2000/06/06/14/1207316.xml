        <p>In an abrupt and unexpected twist, testimony in the federal tax-fraud trial of Albert J. Pirro Jr. and his brother, Anthony G. Pirro, ended this morning when the defense rested without calling any witnesses.</p>

        <p>In an abrupt and unexpected twist, testimony in the federal tax-fraud trial of Albert J. Pirro Jr. and his brother, Anthony G. Pirro, ended this morning when the defense rested without calling any witnesses.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Albert Pirro does not wish to call any witnesses, alive or dead,'' said Gustave H. Newman, the lead lawyer for Mr. Pirro. That sentiment, minus the colorful language, was then echoed by Roger L. Stavis, Anthony Pirro's lawyer.</p>
        <p>The announcement surprised the gallery, which included at least one person who was ready to testify for the defense. And it appeared to catch jurors off guard, too. Within minutes of the announcement, during a sidebar conference of the lawyers and Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr., the eight-man, four-woman jury chatted noisily among themselves.</p>
        <p>None of the principals had any comment -- not the prosecutors, not the lawyers for either brother, not even the normally voluble and affable Albert Pirro, who is the husband of Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney. But several lawyers and former prosecutors said that the defense's strategy suggested confidence that the government had failed to prove that the two brothers intentionally and improperly deducted about $1.2 million of Albert Pirro's personal expenses as business expenditures.</p>
        <p>''They're basically rolling the dice and hoping that the jury will agree that the government hasn't proven intent,'' said William I. Aronwald, a former federal prosecutor who is now a defense lawyer in White Plains. ''If they guessed right, it's a great decision. If they guessed wrong, they still may have made a good decision because if Al Pirro's testimony was not credible, it wouldn't have made a difference anyway.''</p>
        <p>Closing arguments are now set to begin on Wednesday morning. If all goes as planned, the jury could begin deliberations on Monday on the 66-count indictment, Judge Parker said.</p>
        <p>When the jury does finally begin to weigh the evidence, it will have to assess almost four weeks of sometimes tedious, sometimes tendentious testimony from about 60 witnesses who painted as much of a picture of Albert and Jeanine Pirro's personal finances as they did of the permutations of income-tax procedures.</p>
        <p>Relying on a parade of contractors, household help and political consultants, federal prosecutors offered an avalanche of material about how Albert Pirro, a real estate development lawyer and powerful Republican lobbyist, used more than a dozen of his companies to buy expensive cars, arrange for home-improvement work and plan luxury vacations -- then deducted those costs as business expenses.</p>
        <p>In all, federal prosecutors said, Albert Pirro managed to reduce his tax liability by more than $400,000 between 1988 and 1997.</p>
        <p>The defense, in both opening arguments and questioning, acknowledged that there were mistakes with the tax returns, but insisted that the brothers' conduct was not criminal. If anything, defense lawyers said repeatedly, Albert Pirro was simply too busy to focus on such mundane tasks as bookkeeping. Instead, defense lawyers suggested that the government was obsessive in pursuing Mr. Pirro, noting that only about 5 percent of the total deductions by Mr. Pirro's companies had been deemed improper.</p>
        <p>In addition, defense lawyers tried to portray Albert Pirro as someone who, upon learning that the government was investigating him, not only repaid about $1 million in back taxes, but also did his best to furnish copies of tax returns, canceled checks, check stubs, invoices and other documents.</p>
        <p>The defense had been expected to call a few witnesses. One was David Hebert, a spokesman for Mrs. Pirro in the district attorney's office, who said that he was prepared to clarify the circumstances surrounding a a check from one of Albert Pirro's companies made out to Mrs. Pirro's 1993 campaign.</p>
        <p>But today, he never got the chance, and left the courtroom disappointed.</p>
        <p>Also attending today's 10-minute session was Mrs. Pirro, who has been a fixture in the front row throughout most of the trial. When asked about the defense's strategy of calling no witnesses, she said: ''I think it's clear that there was no need to. I have every confidence in the system. I believe he will be vindicated.''</p>
        <p>What seemed particularly telling, though, said Mr. Aronwald, the former prosecutor, was that the government tried unsuccessfully on Monday to introduce evidence about Albert Pirro's supposed familiarity with tax law, dating back to publications and courses from his law school days, almost 30 years ago. ''It suggests to me that the government is nervous about its case,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even so, many lawyers seemed to agree that it would not be surprising if the Pirros were either convicted or acquitted.</p>
        <p>''I think the result is anyone's guess,'' said Kerry A. Lawrence, a defense lawyer in White Plains and a former federal prosecutor. ''This is very much what's called a summation case, where you've got facts that both sides are going to spin in two diametrically opposed ways. And what a jury does with that, I wouldn't begin to guess.''</p>
