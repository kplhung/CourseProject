        <p>IN the interest of full disclosure, I should mention that the last time I took a correspondence course was back in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>The thick stack of essay questions that arrived in the mail would have been enough to make me feel isolated. On top of that, the subject was feminist literature, and the first assignment was to read Kate Chopin's ''Awakening,'' whose alienated protagonist drowns herself. Thereafter, most of my creative energy was directed toward writing pleas for deadline extensions.</p>
        <p>So when I heard a few weeks ago about a new online cooking school created by the editors of Cook's Illustrated, I was wary. Long an admirer of the exhaustive approach that Cook's takes to testing ingredients, techniques and recipes -- O.K., it can get obsessive -- I had no doubt that the editors would display the same zeal on the Internet that they have brought to their famously persnickety taste tests of items like chunk light tuna. But frankly, a cooking correspondence course still sounded lonely.</p>
        <p>Learning to cook, after all, is the ultimate collaborative activity. It's something you do best when you stand in the kitchen and watch an expert at work -- preferably your grandmother, since this is probably the only person you know with the rare combination of skill and patience to endure your subsequent clumsy attempts to mince garlic with her best knife.</p>
        <p>In comparison, to enroll in an Internet correspondence course like the ones at Cook's University, you go to www .cooksillustrated.com, click on ''Cooking School,'' select your courses and type in your credit card number to authorize a tuition payment of $19.95 to $39.95 (unless you enroll in ''Classic Tomato Sauces,'' which is free). That is less than half the cost of a five-hour course at a cooking school, and you can learn at home, which saves you the heartbreak of trying to replicate the results of a professional kitchen on your electric stove, using the one burner that gets hot.</p>
        <p>But over the Internet you're not going to get Julia Child with her raspy voice and flashing cleaver. Like Cook's magazine, the online version emphasizes words, words, words, supplemented by spare line drawings to illustrate techniques like how to cut carrots into julienne. There are no video clips and few photos, but I can't say I missed them.</p>
        <p>I signed up for ''Classic Tomato Sauces,'' ''Stir-Fry Basics'' and ''Everyday Saute.'' Although I could go through the lessons at my own pace when convenient, the idea was to finish in a two- or four-week period (depending on the course), when the instructor, a Cook's editor, was available to respond to e-mail queries.</p>
        <p>Before the courses began, small hardcover books were mailed from the Cook's Illustrated Library (list price usually $14.95 each). Although barely bigger than the Beatrix Potter titles my children collect, ''How to Saute,'' ''How to Make Pasta Sauces'' and ''How to Stir-Fry'' were jam-packed with the charmingly cranky Cook's opinions, including the assertion that the Chinese wok and the American stovetop are a lousy match.</p>
        <p>On the dates my classes started, I logged in, printed out the first lessons on equipment and techniques and read them in bed later. If I had questions, I went back to the site the next day and clicked on ''Quick Tips'' or posted notes to other students or sent e-mail to the instructor.</p>
        <p>The site was designed by Learning Labs of Boston. Faced with the challenge of translating the undecorated Cook's style to the Internet, Learning Labs built a site layered with information. You navigate by using a menu on the left side of the screen. You can post notes on the pages that are relevant. When you click on ''Resources'' to delve deeper into the instructional materials, it almost feels like getting your grandmother to reveal a cooking secret.</p>
        <p>Like the magazine, the site is supported by paying customers, so there are no annoying ads.</p>
        <p>The Cook's books overlapped the online curriculum. But one thing neither the books nor an old-fashioned correspondence course could match was the direct communication I got online. On the Internet your instructor and classmates are only an e-mail message away; on weekdays I got answers in an hour or two. (In the initial offering of the free course on tomato sauces, Cook's capped enrollment at 500. In the other courses, 12 to 60 students enrolled, said Christopher Kimball, the publisher of Cook's.)</p>
        <p>I met one of them after I tried a beef stir-fry recipe, which was punctuated by the dog's chasing the cat through my kitchen and knocking over my 2-year-old daughter, who grabbed her leg and started shrieking for a Band-Aid. I smelled burning. A reconstruction of the charred material stuck to the nonstick skillet indicated eggplant. I posted an understated plea for help online: the eggplant absorbed the oil very quickly and the pan became dry. Did anyone else have this experience?</p>
        <p>A few days later, a student named Dan replied, suggesting more oil. Further heartened by e-mail from the instructor, Rebecca Hays, who indicated that it was fine to substitute fatty skirt steak for the less tasty flank cut in the recipe, I tried the dish again. Success.</p>
        <p>With no space constraints online, the Cook's curriculum also offers many little tips, some in pop-up windows, accessible in the text or at the bottom of the window. They are the sort of asides your grandmother might toss off over her shoulder: remove baked-on food from pans by adding a little water, bringing it to a boil and then scraping. Never saute in butter alone -- it burns.</p>
        <p>I tried six recipes, and all of them worked if I followed the directions. I never had to modify temperature or cooking time to make a dish come out right. And they contained numerous helpful hints, like toasting rice in oil before you add water and mashing minced garlic to release its flavor.</p>
        <p>Of course, the classes weren't perfect. If I had been cooking with my grandmother, she would have re-minced those boulders of garlic for me.</p>
        <p>Online Inspection Reports</p>
        <p>After being overwhelmed by more than 1,000 online visitors an hour when it opened last month, the New York City Health Department's restaurant inspection Web site has improved its computer capacity. On Monday, it was working fine.</p>
        <p>The database of health violations, updated weekly, allows you to search for restaurants by name or location. You go to nyclink .org/health and click on ''Restaurant Inspection Information.''</p>
        <p>If you're not sure what a particular violation means, a pop-up glossary offers definitions. Vermin, for instance, are insects or small animals that are destructive, annoying or harmful to health, including cockroaches, flies and rats. As for wastewater, I really don't think you want to know.</p>
