        <p>CALL it water torture circa 2000 -- not the prisoner-of-war kind, the ''sparkling or still?'' variety.</p>
        <p>Finding a restaurant in boomtown New York where the waiter doesn't pop the question has become increasingly difficult, so much so that when I was at La Cote Basque last weekend and ice water appeared without question, I thought I might offer to chip in on the waiter's mortgage.</p>
        <p>It was a completely unexpected change from most restaurants, where the waiter's typical, faux-friendly delivery is tinged with the slightest challenge that says, ''You're not going to be cheap about this now, are you?''</p>
        <p>This being New York, of course, not everyone is suffering in silence. Richard Kornberg, a theatrical publicity agent, described a recent visit to Tello's Ristorante on West 19th Street. ''Instead of 'What would you like to drink?' the waiter asked, 'What type of bottled water would you like?' '' Mr. Kornberg recalled. ''And I said, 'Free.' ''</p>
        <p>As one restaurateur reluctantly admitted: ''Bottled water has become the squeegee washer of the restaurant world. Everyone is afraid to say no.''</p>
        <p>And they're paying for the privilege. Large bottles of water -- usually a liter, sparkling or still, Evian or San Pellegrino or other equivalents -- range from $6 (Union Square Cafe) to $10 (Lespinasse) to $12 (the newly reopened Rainbow Grill). And who says you can drink just one? Many diners complain that after ordering a bottle, the waiter keeps more coming without further ado; by the time coffee's served, it's a cinch to rack up an extra $30.</p>
        <p>Janis Donnaud, a literary agent, said: ''It's like heroin the way they push bottled water. I actually stopped drinking it because it infuriated me. I started adding up what I spent on it at the end of a week, and it was like a salary. Look at the bill sometimes, the beverages cost as much as the food. Unless you're in a diner, it seems it happens every place you go.''</p>
        <p>What's going on, exactly?</p>
        <p>Danny Meyer, who owns Union Square Cafe, Tabla, Gramercy Tavern and Eleven Madison Park, had some ideas. ''Bottled water is an area to make a few extra dollars,'' he said, adding that his wholesale price for a large bottle of Evian water is $1.40.</p>
        <p>''I can't stand it when I go to restaurants, either,'' he continued. ''In the Union Square Cafe manual we instruct the waiters to ask, 'Ice water or mineral water?' If mineral water is proposed first, it becomes about pleasing or disappointing the waiter. And tap water sounds patronizing. It can be a hot-button issue where right off the bat you feel the waiter is not on your side.''</p>
        <p>Tim Zagat, publisher of the Zagat Surveys, encourages diners to speak up for themselves. ''It's a bad thing if people don't have the confidence to say, 'I'm happy with New York City water,' '' he said. ''If a restaurant is halfway decent, it wants to make you happy, not the other way around.''</p>
        <p>But there are also aesthetic issues to consider, certain chefs say, including Christian Delouvrier of Lespinasse. ''When I taste a dish, I use flat mineral water,'' he said. ''It gives you a better idea of what you're eating than tap water, which is heavier and can sometimes have a taste that will interfere with the food. Sparkling water I have no problem with, but with the flat, you have a cleaner, lighter taste on your mouth. It's pure.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the temptation to pad the bill. Andrea Immer, the director of beverage programs for Starwood Hotels, which includes the W Hotels in New York, said, ''The food and beverage industries view bottled water as a legitimate revenue source, an add-on sale and missed opportunity if you don't offer it, like espresso or side dishes.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Immer does, however, train members of her staff about instant refills. ''That needs to be a question rather than an automatic assumption,'' she said. ''For the price of a bottle, I'd rather have another glass of Champagne.''</p>
        <p>Even restaurants that aren't selling bottled water are using water as a table accessory. At Time Cafe, tap water is served in colored glass bottles; at Cafe Luxembourg, Pastis and Village, it is served in glass carafes.</p>
        <p>''The decanter is a Parisian affectation,'' said Clark Wolf, a restaurant and hotel consultant based in New York. ''But it is also a way of saying, 'We're not going to stick you with eight bucks.' ''</p>
        <p>He emphasized that for as much of a markup as a restaurant can take on a bottle of water, it can take an even higher one on juice or soda. ''You can charge $3 for a 7Up straight from the soda gun behind the bar,'' he said, ''compared to $6 for a large bottle of Evian. So bottled water is not a guaranteed check booster unless it is an addition, rather than a substitution.''</p>
        <p>Well, restaurants are a business after all, aren't they? I just can't help imagining what the next must-have check booster will be. I'm betting on those cozy table-side visits from the smiling busboys, tongs and baskets in hand, who lean over and whisper softly in your ear, ''Semolina or sourdough?''</p>
        <p>Think about it.</p>
