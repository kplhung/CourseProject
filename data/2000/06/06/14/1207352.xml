        <p>Chamique Holdsclaw peered through the four Liberty hands flying desperately in her face, and from 10 feet back, she floated her trademark fade-away jumper.</p>
        <p>As Holdsclaw fell backward to the floor at Madison Square Garden, her shot pierced the net to give the Mystics a 57-56 lead, stunning the Liberty with only 10.8 seconds left in what had already been a gritty tug-of-war between the Women's National Basketball Association rivals.</p>
        <p>Her 10th and final basket, the most defining one of her young pro career, provided the last points of the game. And with it, Holdsclaw helped Washington (4-2) exact its second straight victory over the Liberty (3-5) this season and give the Mystics their fifth victory in six meetings since Holdsclaw became the league's No. 1 draft pick last year.</p>
        <p>''This is probably the biggest shot I have hit on the professional level and it feels great,'' Holdsclaw said, still beaming after scoring a game-high 23 points in front of 11,559 fan, 70 of them representing friends and family of the Astoria, Queens, native.</p>
        <p>Until Holdsclaw got the ball on a designed inbounds play with 16.4 seconds left, the Liberty looked as though it would preserve a 56-55 lead. But Holdsclaw's shot created the seventh lead change of the game, and it was a dagger.</p>
        <p>''I'd rather lose by 50 points than by one point,'' Liberty guard Becky Hammon said.</p>
        <p>Hammon missed a layup with 5 seconds left, and her teammate Tari Phillips took a baseline shot with 1.6 seconds left that fell short. Vickie Johnson could not turn the rebound into a shot fast enough and when the buzzer sounded, Holdsclaw punctuated the air with her index finger.</p>
        <p>A star at Christ the King High School, Holdsclaw first played in the Garden as a willowy senior at Tennessee and was struck with stage fright, scoring 8 points.</p>
        <p>''I never had a great game at the Garden, '' she said after making 10 of 21 shots and collecting 12 rebounds. ''But tonight, for once in my career, I came in and felt relaxed.''</p>
        <p>Sue Wicks saw that.</p>
        <p>''She's finally being the superstar she was touted to be,'' Wicks said. ''It was a tough shot and she nailed it.''</p>
        <p>Wicks threw a hand in Holdsclaw's face when Johnson, who was guarding Holdsclaw, was screened out by Washington's Vicky Bullett. Johnson threw a hand up, too. No matter.</p>
        <p>''Huge. Huge. Huge,'' Washington Coach Nancy Darsch said, describing Holdsclaw's game-winning basket. ''She can get over people and get her own shot.''</p>
        <p>Holdsclaw was the only Mystics player who scored in double figures and her final shot spoiled an inspired games by the Liberty's Teresa Weatherspoon, who scored a season-high 14 points, and Johnson, who also scored 14.</p>
        <p>Johnson made two foul shots with 1:28 remaining, and then the Liberty forced a steal from its stifling full-court press. Hammon, who had 10 first-half points to help give the Liberty a 29-26 advantage, calmly sank a 3-pointer at the top of the arc with 1:16 left. With 51.4 seconds remaining, Weatherspoon stretched for a loose ball, and caused it to go off a Mystics player. After a timeout, Johnson made a running layup for the 56-55 lead by the Liberty that Holdsclaw wiped out.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the second half, Holdsclaw had brought her team back from a 9-point deficit and had converted the 3-point play that gave Washington its first second-half lead, 45-43, at the 9:40 mark.</p>
        <p>Holdsclaw's heroics would not have been so necessary if the Liberty had not gone scoreless for five minutes in the middle of the second half.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I think we want to beat them too bad, we missed easy shots,'' Johnson said.</p>
        <p>Holdsclaw did not.</p>
