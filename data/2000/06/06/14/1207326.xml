        <p>Leaders of Two Koreas Confer in Pyongyang  Opening formalities at the first summit meeting between North and South Korea seemed surprisingly relaxed, exceeding the expectations of many people, including perhaps those of the principals themselves, Kim Jong Il of the North and Kim Dae Jung of the South. During a 27 minute-meeting, they discussed the need to establish a hotline, and talks today are expected to focus on issues that divide the two countries.</p>
