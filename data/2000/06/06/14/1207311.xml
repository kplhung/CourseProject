        <p>Schools around New York State vastly overuse pesticides, and often fail to warn parents, students and school staff members when the chemicals are applied, according to a report released today by Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer.</p>
        <p>The report says that more than 90 percent of schools around the state use poisons to kill insects, rodents and weeds, but that only about half notify parents or students in advance or post signs indicating that pesticides have been applied.

        <p>Schools around New York State vastly overuse pesticides, and often fail to warn parents, students and school staff members when the chemicals are applied, according to a report released today by Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer.</p>
        <p>The report says that more than 90 percent of schools around the state use poisons to kill insects, rodents and weeds, but that only about half notify parents or students in advance or post signs indicating that pesticides have been applied. The figures were derived from schools' own responses to a survey, and officials in the attorney general's office said the true picture was probably worse, because some schools did not reply to the survey, while others likely understated their pesticide use.</p>
        <p>The release of the report coincides with a debate in the Legislature over bills requiring notification of pesticide use and limiting pesticide use in schools.</p>
        <p>The Assembly, controlled by Democrats, has passed a bill requiring that any commercial application of pesticides -- by a lawn care service, for instance, as opposed to a homeowner -- be preceded by written warning to neighbors. The Senate, controlled by Republicans, has passed a weaker version of the bill, and the two sides appear unlikely to resolve their differences this year. The bills are opposed by the pesticide industry.</p>
        <p>The Assembly bill would require  notification of parents before any use of pesticides in schools. The report by Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat, was timed in part to nudge the debate in the direction of the Assembly bill.  Another bill passed by the Assembly would require schools to adopt formal pest management plans, and to  use the least toxic options available. An identical bill is before the Senate, but it has not been acted upon.</p>
        <p>The results of Mr. Spitzer's survey closely resembled those from a similar survey, conducted by the attorney general's office several years ago, despite growing concern in the intervening years about the effects of pesticides and a growing body of research showing potential harm.</p>
        <p>''The results are incredibly depressing, to think that after seven years of education and training and building awareness, to find that nothing has changed,'' said Claire Barnett, executive director of the Health Schools Network, a group that has lobbied for a pesticide notification law.</p>
        <p>The report comes days after the federal Environmental Protection Agency announced a ban on over-the-counter products containing chlorpyrifos, also known as Dursban, the most common insecticide, in part because of the nerve damage it can do to children. The survey of New York schools showed that the most commonly used pesticides were organophosphates, a class that includes chlorpyrifos and has been shown to have a wide range of health effects, including neurological problems.</p>
        <p>''The vast majority of schools in New York State use toxic pesticides in and around school buildings,'' Mr. Spitzer's report said. ''By doing so, they impose risks on the health and well-being of both students and staff. The risks are imposed without warning and without even the opportunity for self-protection by avoidance.''</p>
        <p>The report also said that in many cases pesticides were used when they were unnecessary or when non toxic options could have been used; in other cases the amount of pesticide used could have been greatly reduced.</p>
        <p>In response to the survey, the New York City Board of Education, replying for all of its more than 1,000 schools, reported routine use of pesticides, both indoors and outdoors, to control insects and rodents, but said pesticides were not generally used for weeds; most of the city's schools do not have playing fields. Of the responding schools outside New York City, 87 percent reported using pesticides either indoors, outdoors or both.</p>
        <p>When asked if students or parents were warned before pesticide use, New York City's schools responded, ''sometimes.'' Outside the city, 59 percent said they always or sometimes gave advance notice of indoor use, while 41 percent said they never did. For outdoor use, 65 percent said they gave notice some or all of the time, while 35 percent said they never did.</p>
        <p>New York City schools reported that they posted signs around treated areas, but only 26 percent of schools outside the city said they did so when pesticides were used indoors.</p>
        <p>The city Board of Education said it had a written policy on pest management and the use of pesticides; just 18 percent of schools outside the city reported having such a policy.</p>
