        <p>BRODY - Frances. American Friends of The Hebrew University and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem deeply mourn the passing of long time supporter, well-known philanthropist and dear friend, Frances Brody. Fran and her late husband Herbert were active Board members for many years. Together, the Brodys established the Herb and Frances Brody Center for Food Sciences at the University's Faculty of Agricultural Food and Environmental Quality Sciences. Fran's great passion for children led to the establishment of the Frances Brody Student Aid Endowment Fund for Handicapped Students at The Hebrew University. Deeply dedicated to the State of Israel and the principles of the University, the Brodys generously supported vital programs including the Krueger Center for Finance, the Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, Rothberg International School, and the Avraham Harman Memorial Foundation, among others. We extend our deepest condolences to her children Susanne Brody and Gary Cohen, Wendy and Gordon Keil, Patti and Daniel Lehrhoff, Andrew and Tracey Brody, her fourteen beloved grandchildren and the entire Brody family.
