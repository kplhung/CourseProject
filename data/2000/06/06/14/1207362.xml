        <p>State lawmakers agreed today to give annual cost-of-living pension increases for the first time to retired state and local government workers. The measure, affecting 1.7 million current and former employees, is projected to cost New York City more than $500 million a year.</p>
        <p>The idea of granting annual increases has been pushed hard for years by the powerful public employees' unions, and championed by a long list of politicians seeking to appeal to New York's large constituency of public sector employees and retirees. Politicians here and labor leaders have portrayed it as an issue of fairness, as most retired public employees collect pensions of less than $15,000 a year, even though public pension funds have swelled in recent years because of the robust stock market.</p>
        <p>Denis Hughes, president of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the deal, reached between legislative leaders and Gov. George E. Pataki, ''will bring a measure of dignity and respect to New York's public employee retirees.''</p>
        <p>The agreement, contained in a bill that could be passed by the Assembly and Senate as early as Wednesday, is the second major legislative victory for public employees in as many days. On Monday, the Legislature passed a bill, which the governor has indicated he will sign, eliminating pension contributions by state and local employees after they have worked for 10 years. Workers now generally contribute 3 percent of their salaries toward their pensions.</p>
        <p>City officials had warned that earlier versions of the cost-of-living proposal could have cost the city as much as $1.2 billion a year, damaging the city's ability to pay for programs and tax cuts, and they lobbied successfully to alter the plan to lower that cost. The city also won the ability to phase in the program over five years.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council have agreed on $418 million in tax cuts in the fiscal year beginning July 1, mostly through reduced personal income tax rates. City officials were hesitant to say today whether that plan could proceed under the agreed-on pension bill. ''We have to review the proposed legislation and analyze its cost,'' said Adam L. Barsky, the mayor's budget director.</p>
        <p>But aides to Mayor Giuliani, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he considered the bill's terms tolerable. The mayor sent a letter today to Governor Pataki, saying that the five-year phase-in ''will enable the city to budget for this legislation in a fiscally responsible way.''</p>
        <p>Even so, the price tag for the city is projected to reach $530 million a year in added pension contributions when the program is fully carried out. That far exceeds the cost of last year's elimination by state lawmakers of the commuter tax, a move that Mayor Giuliani loudly protested and which cost the city $360 million a year in lost revenue. It is the next mayor, not Mr. Giuliani, who leaves office in 18 months, who must find a way to absorb most of the cost.</p>
        <p>Some independent analysts, including the Citizens Budget Commission, have warned that the plan would undermine the pension funds' long-term stability. They contend that pension increases should be won by unions at the bargaining table, not given away.</p>
        <p>But the pension funds managed by State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, which cover state workers and most local government workers, are so flush thanks to the stock market boom that the employers have not made any pension contributions in two years. State officials estimate an annual cost-of-living adjustment will not cost the employers anything for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>The city's pension funds are not as well-stocked, though they, too, have profited from the strong market, and the city continues to make pension contributions for its employees, though at a reduced rate.</p>
        <p>For years, Mr. McCall, who is planning a run for governor in 2002, has called for automatic pension increases, cementing his standing as a favorite of state workers and retirees. This year, Governor Pataki appointed a task force to study the issue, which recommended adoption of the change. The governor formally endorsed the idea in May.</p>
        <p>Most states have automatic annual pension increases, said Steven Greenberg, Mr. McCall's chief spokesman, and he said it was the comptroller's management of the pension system that made it possible for New York to follow suit.</p>
        <p>''It's the right thing to do,'' he said. ''The employers' contributions are down and the employees' contributions are down, so the only people who haven't benefited are the retirees.''</p>
        <p>The automatic increases will apply to more than one million retirees, and to 500,000 current state and local government employees when they retire. They include nearly all categories of government workers in New York State; the major exceptions are New York City police and firefighters, who receive pension increases under a separate system.</p>
        <p>Until now, public employees' pensions have risen only when the Legislature and the governor could agree on a ''supplementation,'' something that occurred every four or five years in good times, and less often when times were bad. Those increases lagged far behind inflation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki and the leaders of the Assembly and Senate agreed today to apply an annual increase of half the rate of inflation to the first $18,000 of a person's pension, with a minimum increase of 1 percent and a maximum of 3 percent. That still would not keep up with inflation, but for the retirees it would be a significant improvement.</p>
        <p>Nonuniformed workers would have to be retired for five years and reach age 62 before the annual increases would begin, while police and firefighters would have to reach age 55 and be retired for 10 years.</p>
