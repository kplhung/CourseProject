        <p>Americans love succulent chicken breasts dressed up in every conceivable way, while Indians relish a savory tandoori drumstick brandished easily in one hand or a spicy chicken curry enriched by the marrow of the leg bone.</p>
        <p>For Perdue Farms, America's No. 3 chicken producer, this divergence in culinary tastes seemed a heaven-sent opportunity. While selling white meat at a premium to Americans, it could ship inexpensive, unwanted dark meat to India.</p>
        <p>So as India prepared to lift its longstanding ban on chicken imports next year in a deal worked out with American trade negotiators, Perdue began developing a strategy to sell leg portions in this potentially huge new market, home to as many as 150 million middle-class customers.</p>
        <p>But India does not have a reputation as one of the world's most protected economies for nothing. There is still a deep ambivalence here about foreign investment and trade, and India has taken a decidedly cautious approach to globalization. Over the last decade, it has let in ever more foreign goods and lowered barriers to trade, cutting average tariffs from 128 percent to 40 percent. Still, India has some of the world's highest tariffs.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, as the domestic chicken industry considered the fearsome prospect of cheap imported dark meat, its lobbyists began to protest. The government hastily agreed last month to raise the tariff on chicken legs from 35 percent to 100 percent -- a year before the import limitations were to be removed.</p>
        <p>''Without the tariff, we would be in a big soup,'' said Anuradha Desai, chairwoman of the Venkateshwara Hatcheries, based in Pune in west-central India, and the National Egg Coordination Committee.</p>
        <p>The higher tariff, if it sticks, would be a big setback for Perdue, for this is a market to make an agribusiness giant salivate. The average Indian eats only 2 pounds of chicken a year, compared with more than 90 pounds for an American. Lower prices could increase consumption exponentially. A 100 percent tariff would sharply curtail Perdue's ability to compete on price in India.</p>
        <p>Chicken is one of more than 1,400 goods that India is taking off its restricted list this year and next and allowing to be freely imported, after tariffs are paid.</p>
        <p>Among those products is a cornucopia fit for a king's table. Cooks will no longer have to scrounge on the black market for foie gras and caviar, chardonnay and cordials. And the rich will be able to serve these treats by the light of foreign-dipped candles on imported yachts.</p>
        <p>But more threatening to Indian industrialists, farmers and fishermen is the free importation of more plebeian items: coffee and tea, cardamom and betel nut, chewing tobacco and motor scooters, textiles and garments, mackerel and, of course, chicken legs.</p>
        <p>And deep in the 10-page list of goods to be freely imported is one that would almost surely horrify India's independence leader, Gandhi, if he were alive. It is item No. 248, cotton that is ''unbleached, plain weave.'' Gandhi made homespun cotton a symbol of India's economic independence from foreign domination, exhorting villagers to spin their own cloth rather than buy it from Britain, India's colonial ruler.</p>
        <p>India began taking steps to open its economy several years ago. In 1997, India told the World Trade Organization that it planned to phase out its list of restricted goods over nine years, which was whittled to six years at the insistence of powerful trading partners. But the United States challenged that pace and won in 1999. India subsequently agreed to lift the restrictions by next April.</p>
        <p>In actual purchasing power, India is now the world's fourth-largest economy, according to the World Bank. Its volume of exports and imports has grown substantially, but its share of global trade remains at just 0.6 percent, the same as it was more than 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>Many Indians, from hard-line Hindu nationalists to Nehruvian socialists, believe India must shield its small producers, even at the expense of higher prices for consumers and lower-quality goods.</p>
        <p>M. S. Swaminathan, a geneticist who played a pivotal role in the Green Revolution -- the development and use of high-yield strains of wheat and rice -- argues that free trade is unfair when mass-produced goods compete against goods made by the masses, particularly in a traditional agrarian society like India. Bankrupt farmers will not be able to buy food at any price. ''There is no level playing field,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But many economists, including those at the World Bank, argue that India should quicken its integration with the global economy as the best path toward lower prices, economic growth and millions of new jobs. Countries in East and Southeast Asia that have moved quickly have had greater success in reducing poverty, they say.</p>
        <p>Even some in India's chicken industry say that it is in the industry's long-term interest to become more globally competitive -- and perhaps, one day, become an exporter itself.</p>
        <p>Kiran Khatri, whose farm is near Delhi, said he sometimes thinks to himself: ''If they can dump drumsticks here, why can't we dump breasts in the American market? For that we'll have to raise our quality. There are lots of diseases.''</p>
        <p>The chicken industries of northern India and the United States seem to come from different centuries.</p>
        <p>In Perdue's highly mechanized plants, when a chicken is placed on a conveyor belt, a worker grabs it and hangs it upside down by the legs -- and it will probably never again be touched by human hands. It will emerge at the other end plucked, chopped and boned; packed in a plastic-foam, shrink-wrapped tray; and stamped with the retail price.</p>
        <p>A single Perdue plant can process a quarter of a million chickens a day. The company, which had revenue of $2.5 billion last year, also produces the chicken feed, hatches the chicks and raises them.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the northern Indian chicken industry is fragmented among hatcheries, chicken farmers, middlemen and traders, while in southern India a number of integrated corporate chicken producers have appeared.</p>
        <p>Estimates of the number of chicken farmers in India, which has a population of a billion, range from 30,000 to 100,000, while a million to a million and a half people depend on the industry.</p>
        <p>A slaughterhouse in New Delhi is often a Dickensian place. In all likelihood, it is a small neighborhood shop where men do the killing and gutting after a housewife -- or a middle-class family's cook -- has selected the bird that will adorn the table that evening.</p>
        <p>New Delhi's INA Market, which is not air-conditioned, caters to expatriates and middle-class Indians. The air inside was heavy with the smell of blood and damp feathers in the 110-degree heat of a recent afternoon. Plump gray rats scurried across floors smeared with blood and guts.</p>
        <p>At the improbably named Fish Corner, one of a dozen chicken shops, a man sat cross-legged slicing off heads against a large fixed blade. A few feet away, men in loincloths and flip-flops squatted precariously on the thin edge of large vats of water, tearing off feathers and dunking birds into the murky liquid.</p>
        <p>The chickens were then cut into pieces and set out in unrefrigerated, open-air cases. Workers stood by to shoo away swarms of flies.</p>
        <p>Shoppers in this market all said they liked their chicken killed fresh. They want it newly killed because they believe it to be fresher, healthier, tastier and less likely to give you gas -- views that could make frozen chicken a hard sell in India.</p>
        <p>Annamma Jacob, who buys imported Tang, Quaker Oats and Kikkoman soy sauce at the market, said she liked picking out a live bird herself, preferably a small, tender one. ''I don't like chicken in the United States,'' said Mrs. Jacob, who owns a garment business and travels to New York occasionally. ''It has no taste.''</p>
        <p>But the chicken preferences of Indians are not the only obstacle to frozen chicken. Some industry experts doubt that it can be profitably distributed until refrigeration is more widely available and power failures less common. There are no big American-style supermarkets in New Delhi, a city of 14 million, or in most of India, for that matter.</p>
        <p>But Keith Sunderlal, an economist here who is a consultant to Perdue, said he was confident that Indians would buy frozen chicken for the same reasons people in America, China and Indonesia do. ''Consumers have all kinds of taste demands,'' he said, ''but what talks is convenience and the pocketbook.''</p>
        <p>And he said he believed Perdue could move large quantities of its chicken legs in New Delhi at perhaps a third to half of what local retailers charge through more than 100 meat shops, equipped with refrigerators, that have opened in recent years.</p>
        <p>At least that is what he thought until India raised the tariff. Now he is not so sure. And Perdue's vice president for international operations, Peggy Vining, said in an interview, ''Anytime you have a tariff that high, it makes exporting more difficult.''</p>
        <p>Perdue still hopes that American officials can persuade India to lower the tariff, but United States diplomats here say they doubt India will do so in the face of a vigorous domestic lobby.</p>
        <p>Without the jolt of much lower prices for frozen chicken, it is hard to see Indians switching from the fresh-killed chicken they find so tasty. Every now and then, Rajana Ramachandran, a housewife, said she picks up Tang or imported cheese at the market, but she said it would never occur to her to buy frozen chicken.</p>
        <p>Americans like their mild bell peppers and their mass-produced chicken, but Indians will stick with fiery hot chilies and fresh chicken.</p>
        <p>''We don't like bland,'' Mrs. Ramachandran said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 16, 2000, Friday  An article in Business Day on Wednesday about chicken exports to India misstated the prices at which Perdue Farms estimated that it could sell chicken legs there. Assuming a 35 percent tariff, the company said, it could charge one-third to one-half less than local merchants, not a third to a half of local prices.</p>
