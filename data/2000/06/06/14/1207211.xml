        <p>Countdown at Ducasse</p>
        <p>The restaurant Alain Ducasse, in the Essex House on Central Park South, is to open on Monday. But some 2,700 would-be diners, who have filled the waiting list like World Series fans lined up outside Yankee Stadium, still have no idea when they will get to eat there.</p>
        <p>Beginning on Friday, the restaurant will start accepting reservations for July and beyond. Priority will be given, Mr. Ducasse said, to those already on the list and the 1,750 regular customers of his Paris and Monte Carlo restaurants who live in the New York region.</p>

        <p>Countdown at Ducasse</p>
        <p>The restaurant Alain Ducasse, in the Essex House on Central Park South, is to open on Monday. But some 2,700 would-be diners, who have filled the waiting list like World Series fans lined up outside Yankee Stadium, still have no idea when they will get to eat there.</p>
        <p>Beginning on Friday, the restaurant will start accepting reservations for July and beyond. Priority will be given, Mr. Ducasse said, to those already on the list and the 1,750 regular customers of his Paris and Monte Carlo restaurants who live in the New York region.</p>
        <p>The restaurant, in the room that formerly housed Les Celebrites, has retained its Art Deco details, but upholstery in vermillion and gold is new and the furnishings include authentic period pieces. In addition, the windows have been turned into greenhouses planted with blooming roses. Gilded sculptures of musical instruments by Arman, whose pieces also decorate Cello on the Upper East Side, are placed in several areas. A private dining room in the kitchen is done in black granite with a fiber-optic ceiling that simulates a starry night.</p>
        <p>The 60-seat restaurant will serve dinner Monday through Friday, from 7:30 p.m. As is the custom at Mr. Ducasse's three-star restaurants in Europe, the table is yours for the evening. Small stools will be provided for women's handbags. The menu is prix fixe, $160, with special menus at higher prices. Lunch, which will start on June 28, will be served on Wednesday and Thursday, also $160 prix fixe.</p>
        <p>Tiffany magnifying glasses will be provided for examining the check, and a Cartier pen for signing it. The number to call for reservations is (212) 265-7300; the fax number is (212) 265-9300.</p>
        <p>Short Orders</p>
        <p>Alan Harding, who decamped from Manhattan to make his mark in Brooklyn several years ago with Patois and Uncle Pho, is opening the Red Rail tomorrow at 502 Henry Street (Sackett Street) in Carroll Gardens. Unlike most places, which open for dinner first, then lunch, the Red Rail is starting off with breakfast and lunch, with dishes like chilies, tomatoes with grits and eggs, and grilled cheese with eggplant.</p>
        <p>Seven, 350 Seventh Avenue (29th Street) in Chelsea, has opened, serving Vincent Barcelona's French-influenced food, like sauteed halibut with leeks in chive vinaigrette or cod with aioli, potatoes and saffron broth.</p>
        <p>Pinocchio, a popular little spot on East 81st Street that was replaced by Butterfield 81, has reopened at 1748 First Avenue (90th Street). It is owned by Mark Petrillo, whose father, Sal, was the chef at the original Pinocchio.</p>
        <p>The long-running Provencal bistro Colombe d'Or, at 134 East 26th Street, has become Peccavi, an Italian Mediterranean spot now owned by Kana Brinckerhoff together with its chef, Joseph Savino.</p>
