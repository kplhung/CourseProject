        <p>Even in exile, Newt Gingrich can be counted on to raise a few hackles on the campaign trail. Only this time, it is hard-core Republican conservatives who are setting him up as bait.</p>
        <p>Starting Wednesday at some 7-Eleven stores in Suffolk County, voters who stop off for a quart of milk can also gaze upon a photograph of Mr. Gingrich flashing across an electronic billboard. The style is pre-revolutionary -- pre-Gingrich revolution, that is.</p>
        <p>Behind him stand his acolytes, the Republican men and women who ran for the House of Representatives in 1994, using the so-called Contract With America, the party's conservative manifesto, as their guide. And if customers really zero in, they can spot, somewhere in the crowd, Representative Michael P. Forbes, who quit the Republican Party in disgust last year to become a Democrat.</p>
        <p>''Who stood with Newt Gingrich 100%?'' the billboard panels will ask. ''Call Congressman Forbes and tell him you are proud he stood by Newt Gingrich in his first year.''</p>
        <p>Labeling him the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent in the House, Republicans are focusing on Mr. Forbes with all the glee and cash they can muster. ''Have you ever heard of the movie 'Dead Man Walking' ?'' asked Representative Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican and head of the House Republican campaign committee, with a crooked grin.</p>
        <p>The latest salvo comes from the Republican Majority Issues Committee, a group that is being sued by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on charges of extortion, racketeering and money laundering and is associated with Representative Tom DeLay, the powerful majority whip.</p>
        <p>Since the group is organized under a provision of the Internal Revenue Code known as Section 527, it can raise and spend unlimited amounts with no disclosure, as long as it does not advocate the election or defeat of candidates. Some in Congress are moving to close this loophole.</p>
        <p>The organization spent ''five figures,'' less than $50,000, on the campaign against Mr. Forbes and is expected to focus on a number of other vulnerable Democrats, said Karl Gallant, the group's chairman.</p>
        <p>''Forbes is a party switcher who has transmogrified from a rock-ribbed Republican conservative, who campaigned on the Contract With America, to one who has now pledged his allegiance to some big-government liberals like Hillary Clinton and Dick Gephardt,'' Mr. Gallant said.</p>
        <p>''Gingrich will get people's attentions because Mrs. Clinton has been chanting the anti-Gingrich mantra.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbes, responding to the unconventional ads, said: ''I'm still the same guy. I'm a fiscal conservative. I happen to believe in guarding our environment, in a balanced budget, lower taxes.''</p>
        <p>Then he assailed the Republican Majority Issues Committee. ''The extremist Republican leadership -- in this case led by Mr. DeLay -- are selling off chunks of the Capitol to people who don't want the American people to know they are dumping millions of dollars into a slush fund in exchange for having their way with the Congress,'' Mr. Forbes said.</p>
        <p>The advertisements, put together by E*billboards, are expected to run for at least a week in 50 Suffolk County convenience stores, most of them 7-Elevens, which are equipped with electronic billboards.</p>
        <p>They will feature three panels -- two of them group photos with Mr. Gingrich, the former House speaker whose words and likeness Democrats often used to scare up their party base.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gallant's group is also sending out a mailing to 20,000 Democratic primary voters in Mr. Forbes's district featuring the same photograph and highlighting 15 of Mr. Forbes's  votes on the Contract With America.</p>
