        <p>IF he'd seen television, Dante, our premier travel writer, might have devised an extra circle of hell where loudspeakers eternally blast television advertising jingles from the 1960's and 1970's.</p>
        <p>Ditties extolled foaming cleansers, dry beers, sugared cereals. But in one airline commercial that clawed itself from the memory pit and began playing in my mind recently, the jingle was meant to persuade business travelers, who were nearly exclusively male in the early 1970's, to invite their wives along. A chorus of insistent women sang to clearly anxious businessmen, ''Take me along, if you love me! Take me along with you!''</p>
        <p>This idea was premature in an era when hidebound bosses frowned on the notion that a company-paid business trip might include something as frivolous as family time. The ad campaign faded.</p>
        <p>But times have changed. Today, more companies appreciate the toll that business travel can take on the lives of both married and single employees. And, given the need to retain quality workers in that prosperous segment of the economy in which business travel is a growing necessity, companies are also designing some business trips to build morale by incorporating family or household members.</p>
        <p>The result is a cultural shift in the business travel market. A household member, typically a spouse or a partner, now tags along on about 20 percent of all business trips, according to travel industry statistics. The number of business trips on which children are included more than tripled during the 1990's, with most of the increase in the last few years.</p>
        <p>The 2000 National Business Travel Monitor by Yesawich, Pepperdine &amp; Brown and Yankelovich Partners suggests that the trend is accelerating. This annual survey of business travelers' attitudes showed significant increases over 1999 in the number of travelers who expect to combine leisure with business this year (65 percent), take a spouse along on at least one trip (46 percent) or bring children (15 percent).</p>
        <p>This trend is especially evident in popular tourist cities like New York, Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla., which also attract a lot of convention and trade show business. In the Orlando region, more commonly associated with the hordes of leisure travelers tramping through Disney World, Universal Orlando and other theme parks, business travelers actually accounted for 21 percent of the total 38.6 million domestic visitors in 1998, according to local statistics.</p>
        <p>Some hotels are aggressively marketing the family connection to corporate travel departments and individual business travelers. Hilton Hotels, for example, said that the number of members of its frequent-stay program who brought children on business trips had tripled between 1998 and 1999.</p>
        <p>In Orlando, executives at a new resort, the Portofino Bay Hotel inside the Universal complex, said that even though the hotel was designed with 40,000 square feet of meeting space to attract corporate events, they had been surprised by the sheer number of business travelers checking in. The hotel, which opened late last year with a design theme that evokes the setting of Portofino, Italy, now does about half of its business in corporate-sponsored travel, according to Jonathan Tisch, the president of Loews Hotels, which built the Portofino Bay in a partnership with the Seagram Company's Universal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tisch said modern work schedules encouraged the overlap of family leisure and business. ''The old concept was you had two weeks off, and one of the people at home wasn't working, so you could pack up the car and take the family away for a couple of weeks,'' he said. Now, he continued, a working couple can often put together only four or five days at a stretch for family travel, and often that needs to be combined with at least some business. ''Hotels are now focused on this as a very formidable market,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To reward performance, companies also are sponsoring more incentive trips that combine business with family leisure. ''The company will say something like, 'Hey, if you meet these sales numbers, you get to go to this terrific place,' '' Mr. Tisch added.</p>
        <p>To market the idea that business travel can sometimes include leisure and family time, hotels had to break through walls of corporate attitudes that said, essentially, if you're having any fun, if you're spending time with someone you love, you're not working.</p>
        <p>I am not suggesting that business travel is becoming a family affair. People traveling alone account for more than 70 percent of the estimated 280 million business trips that Americans make annually, according to travel industry statistics.</p>
        <p>Basically, the business trip remains a lonely, away-from-kith-and-kin slog -- even more so, in fact, as corporate travelers span out across the world on tight, multidestination itineraries that increasingly allow almost no time off.</p>
        <p>But hardened attitudes about sending people on the road like combat soldiers have softened enough so that hotels and other destinations are scrambling to design facilities, services and programs -- from day-trip excursions to day care centers -- and market them aggressively to the corporate travel office.</p>
        <p>''You see them here all the time,'' said Crawford F. Sherman, the general manager of Portofino Bay. ''They're all business, in meetings all morning. After lunch, the name tags come off and they leave. They're out the rest of the day playing with the family.''</p>
