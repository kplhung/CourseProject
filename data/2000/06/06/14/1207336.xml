        <p>The Lockheed Martin Corporation has agreed to pay $13 million to the government to settle a case involving the sale of satellite technology to China in 1994, company and Clinton administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>The company was charged with violating arms export laws. The settlement, which officials said is likely to be announced on Wednesday by the State Department, is the largest civil penalty ever assessed under the Arms Export Control Act, the primary law regulating sales of American technology.</p>
        <p>A criminal investigation is still under way over whether the Loral Space and Communication Corporation also violated export controls in a separate incident. The Lockheed Martin settlement may put pressure on Loral to settle that case.</p>
        <p>But it also allows the Clinton administration -- which has been charged with laxness in keeping sensitive technology out of Chinese hands -- to argue in the midst of a presidential election year that it is enforcing export control laws.</p>
        <p>In a statement tonight, Lockheed Martin's spokesman, James Fetig, confirmed that the company, the world's largest military manufacturer, had decided to settle the case, in which the State Department had charged the company with 30 violations of arms export laws. He said that under the agreement, Lockheed Martin neither admits nor denies the allegations.</p>
        <p>The financial settlement came close to the maximum penalty of $15 million. But under the terms of the accord, officials said, the company is spared a far more costly fate: a suspension of its rights to export satellite technology.</p>
        <p>In its statement, Lockheed Martin said, ''The corporation appreciates the opportunity to enter into a settlement agreement with the Department of State that resolves the charges.</p>
        <p>''We are committed to full compliance with all export control measures and believe this agreement will allow us to assure the State Department that we will meet all of our export control obligations.''</p>
        <p>At issue in the case was a series of interchanges between Lockheed Martin rocket experts and the Chinese about kick motors, which are small rocket motors that are used to lift a satellite into its final orbit. At the time of the exchanges, Chinese-made kick motors had suffered a number of failures. Martin Marietta Aerospace, which was later acquired by Lockheed, provided help to AsiaSat, a satellite company based in Hong Kong with heavy financial ties to the Chinese government. AsiaSat was a client of Martin Marietta.</p>
        <p>The technical transfers caused considerable concern within the State and Defense Departments. The same kick-motor technology that helps China in launching commercial communications satellites, officials said, could help its military launch spy satellites. In April, the State Department spokesman at the time, James P. Rubin, said ''any assistance to Chinese technical capability in space launch has the potential to be applied to missile development.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, the State Department charged that Martin Marietta had failed to clear its technical analysis of the rocket problems with Washington before passing it on to the Chinese, and had made no effort later to retrieve it. The company said at the time that it had violated no laws.</p>
        <p>At the time, the Clinton administration was encouraging more commercial interchanges between American and Chinese satellite companies. But the rules on those transfers have since been tightened by Congress, in reaction to disclosures that in 1996, two years after the Martin Marietta incident, Loral had helped Chinese rocket makers solve a different set of technical problems.</p>
        <p>Those transfers, officials say, raised more security concerns than Martin Marietta's help to AsiaSat.</p>
        <p>Under the civil agreement, Lockheed Martin will be allowed to use $5 million of its fine to install computer systems that would give the American government access to all of its foreign space and missile deals. The access is to include data that might require licenses for export.</p>
