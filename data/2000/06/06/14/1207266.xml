        <p>The three executives behind the UAL Corporation's $4.3 billion bid to acquire US Airways defended the deal on Capitol Hill for the first time today and were greeted with skepticism from some lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Appearing before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in the first of four scheduled hearings to be held by various committees, both James E. Goodwin, the chief executive of UAL, the parent of United Airlines, and Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman of US Airways, said that the deal would offer greater choice and better service to consumers.</p>
        <p>They were joined by Robert L. Johnson, the chief executive of DC Air, which would take over most of the US Airways operations at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington.</p>
        <p>But some lawmakers expressed concerns about how the deal would affect competition. ''This is a win-win for you three gentlemen, stockholders and most of the lobbyists in town,'' said Representative Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois, referring to an earlier description of the deal by Mr. Goodwin. ''But I don't think it's a win-win from the point of view of the customer.''</p>
        <p>Representative Bud Shuster, Republican of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the committee, said that he believed US Airways would have to declare bankruptcy within years if the deal did not go through. But Mr. Wolf said the airline would continue to ''compete vigorously to infinity should this not happen.''</p>
