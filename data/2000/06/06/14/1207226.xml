        <p>MICHELIN stars, even three big ones, are no help when it comes to barbecue. That's what the staff at Citymeals-on-Wheels found out when they invited some big-name chefs from France like Michel Troisgros, Michel Rostang, Jean-Pierre Vigato, Jean-Paul Lacombe and Guy Savoy to join a battery of Americans, including barbecue experts like Hugh Bosley of Moonlight Bar-B-Q in Owensboro, Ky., and Rich Davis of K.C. Masterpiece, near Kansas City, Mo. They were all asked to cook barbecue for about 1,200 guests in black ties and bluejeans in the restaurants around the skating rink at Rockefeller Center on Monday night.</p>
        <p>Mr. Troisgros, the three-star chef, made a cold crayfish stew, saying that it counted as barbecue because it was spicy and marinated. ''Michel Rostang got us involved, and he didn't understand barbecue any better than I did,'' Mr. Troisgros said. Mr. Rostang, of Michel Rostang in Paris, wound up serving berries with Champagne sorbet.</p>

        <p>MICHELIN stars, even three big ones, are no help when it comes to barbecue. That's what the staff at Citymeals-on-Wheels found out when they invited some big-name chefs from France like Michel Troisgros, Michel Rostang, Jean-Pierre Vigato, Jean-Paul Lacombe and Guy Savoy to join a battery of Americans, including barbecue experts like Hugh Bosley of Moonlight Bar-B-Q in Owensboro, Ky., and Rich Davis of K.C. Masterpiece, near Kansas City, Mo. They were all asked to cook barbecue for about 1,200 guests in black ties and bluejeans in the restaurants around the skating rink at Rockefeller Center on Monday night.</p>
        <p>Mr. Troisgros, the three-star chef, made a cold crayfish stew, saying that it counted as barbecue because it was spicy and marinated. ''Michel Rostang got us involved, and he didn't understand barbecue any better than I did,'' Mr. Troisgros said. Mr. Rostang, of Michel Rostang in Paris, wound up serving berries with Champagne sorbet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lacombe, of Leon de Lyon, came up with cocktail skewers of barbecued chicken, duck and pineapple with little potato crepes. Mr. Vigato, of Apicius in Paris, caught on to barbecue and poached, then roasted, slabs of pork breast on the rind, making it very French, however, with a truffle vinaigrette. It drew raves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Savoy, who has seven Paris restaurants, threw up his hands at the whole concept and made his signature dessert, a chocolate-praline feuillete with chicory cream. As a result, the guests never got to taste an excellent grilled cumin flatbread, which he planned to serve with a winy onion jam. The benefit committee vetoed it as not elaborate enough.</p>
        <p>For a $375-a-ticket party, maybe. But for your backyard grill, it's fine.</p>
        <p>GRILLED OLIVE OIL AND CUMIN FLATBREAD  Adapted from Guy Savoy  Time: 45 minutes, plus 70 minutes for rising</p>
        <p>1 packet dry yeast  1 1/2 teaspoons sugar</p>
        <p>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus oil for brushing</p>
        <p>1/4 cup whole wheat flour</p>
        <p>1/4 cup white cornmeal</p>
        <p>1/2 tablespoon salt  1 tablespoon cumin seeds  2 1/2 cups, approximately, all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese  Onion jam or chutney (optional).</p>
        <p>1. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in  1/2 cup warm water. When mixture is bubbly, stir in olive oil,  1/2 cup warm water, whole wheat flour, cornmeal, salt and cumin. Stir in all-purpose flour a cup at a time by hand or by machine to form a dough. Knead gently on floured board 5 minutes, then forcefully for 5 more minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Place dough in an oiled bowl, cover, and let rest 30 minutes. Roll out to form a thin rectangle 12 by 16 inches, and place on an oiled baking sheet. Prick all over, and set aside to rise 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Heat grill. Prick bread again, and brush with olive oil. Place baking sheet on grill. Grill 5 to 10 minutes, until lightly browned underneath. Turn bread over, and place directly on grill for about 5 minutes, until browned. Remove from grill, dust with Parmesan cheese, and fold in half lengthwise. Cut in strips 1 1/2 inches wide. May be served with onion marmalade or chutney.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 servings.</p>
