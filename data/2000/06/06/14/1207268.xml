        <p>Four months after scientists at a particle collider in Switzerland announced they had recreated traces of a primordial form of matter, a more powerful device at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island has begun smashing particles together in hope of making the substance in bulk and learning more about the earliest moments of the universe, the laboratory said yesterday.</p>
        <p>And it has apparently done so without touching off the cataclysm that some neighbors had warned would result. Before the device's start-up last year, the laboratory mounted a public relations campaign to allay a welter of conspiracy theories about the particle collider, called the relativistic heavy ion collider, or RHIC (pronounced RICK).</p>
        <p>Though the $600 million collider opened about a year ago at the lab in Upton, N.Y., the achievement of the first particle collisions was delayed by technical problems.</p>
        <p>But scientists at Brookhaven said that by Monday evening, their detectors had collected definitive evidence that gold nuclei were colliding at nearly the speed of light in the device. The scientists hope that the hot, dense soup of particles created in the collisions will reproduce some of the conditions that they speculate existed when the universe was just fractions of a second old and exploding as a fireball called the Big Bang.</p>
        <p>In those first instants, scientists believe, subatomic particles called quarks and gluons roamed freely, rather than being locked inside the protons and neutrons that make up atomic nuclei, as they seem to be now. Gold has the heaviest nucleus that is easily accelerated at RHIC, the scientists said.</p>
        <p>Thomas Ludlam, a physicist and an administrator of the scientific program at the collider, said the final evidence of collisions came from images of showers of debris emanating from a spot where beams of gold nuclei crossed. ''We were able to realize immediately that these were collisions,'' Dr. Ludlam said.</p>
        <p>The February announcement by CERN, a particle-physics laboratory in Geneva, stirred controversy when some Brookhaven scientists charged that the CERN experiments had not produced definitive evidence of free quarks.</p>
        <p>Instead, the scientists said, the  CERN announcement was timed to upstage the announcement of first collisions at Brookhaven. ''Clearly the timing was associated with RHIC coming online,'' said John Harris, a  physics professor at Yale University and the spokesman for one of the experiments at Brookhaven.</p>
        <p>But Claude Detraz, director of research at CERN, said the lab stood by its finding that what he called ''deconfined quarks'' had been produced, and dismissed the suggestion that the timing of the announcement was contrived. ''It was a convenient time, because we are just finishing this program,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Detraz said the Brookhaven collisions were ''really good news,'' since they would allow deeper study of ''what we have only a glimpse of.''</p>
        <p>Frank Wilczek, one of three theoretical physicists who originally predicted that a soup of free quarks and gluons would be produced in hot compressed matter, said the CERN results ''hint around at the possibility of a quark-gluon description.''</p>
        <p>But he said it remained for Brookhaven scientists to prove definitively that they had seen a state of nearly free quarks and gluons.</p>
