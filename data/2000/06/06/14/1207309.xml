        <p>In Austin Croshere's first two years with the Indiana Pacers, he spoke with Coach Larry Bird about as often as Croshere played, which wasn't much.</p>
        <p>''He hardly said anything to me,'' Croshere said. ''Or if he did, I never heard him.''</p>
        <p>Bird was harder on Croshere than on the other Pacers. He had to be. Croshere was the first draft pick of Bird's era, and the player's injuries and inconsistent play wore on the coach. Bird treated the forward as if his pet project had let him down, as if Croshere had invalidated Bird's keen eye for talent.</p>
        <p>The verbal barbs and potshots continued this season in line with Bird's method of breaking a young player down before building him up.</p>
        <p>It began in the summer of 1997, after the Pacers plucked Croshere out of Providence College. Even this season, there was an edge to their relationship.</p>
        <p>''He said in the paper during the season once that I'd be lucky to be in the C.B.A.,'' Croshere said. ''He'd make comments like that in practice a lot, like, 'You ever going to make a shot when it matters?' He says stuff like that all the time.''</p>
        <p>One of the more heartwarming exchanges came after Croshere sprained his ankle and walked into Bird's office to let him know about his availability for the next game.</p>
        <p>''Coach, it's sore, it hurts,'' Croshere said. ''But I'm going to try and go.''</p>
        <p>''Are you going to try and go or are you going to go?'' Bird asked.</p>
        <p>''All right, I'm going to go,'' he said. ''I kind of walked out of his office and he kind of says under his breath, 'Don't be a sissy.' ''</p>
        <p>''It's constant,'' Croshere said. ''I don't mind. I understand what he's trying to do, what he's trying to make of me.''</p>
        <p>Through all the ribbing, all the trials, Croshere has emerged as one of the finest young role players in the league. Rewarding Bird for sticking with him, his ability to knock down the 3-pointer and score with his back to the basket hurt the Knicks in the Eastern Conference finals and have been hurting the Los Angeles Lakers for a week.</p>
        <p>Croshere is averaging 17.3 points and 5 rebounds in the three Pacer-Laker games on 57 percent shooting. The numbers are strong, but they are even more impressive when you realize that he played in only 53 games the last two years, averaging 3 points and 2 rebounds.</p>
        <p>Competing against the Lakers in the N.B.A.'s showcase event hardly seemed in the cards for Croshere when he was growing up. A self-proclaimed ''Showtime kid,'' he once dressed up as Kurt Rambis for Halloween. From his living room in Santa Monica, Calif., he worshiped Magic Johnson and cursed at the television every time Bird, the player, complained about a call.</p>
        <p>''I hated him growing up,'' Croshere said. ''I was a Laker fan, a big Showtime fan. It was always Magic or Bird. I respected Bird, but I hated him. You know? You had to.''</p>
        <p>The sports villain from his youth eventually became his mentor, teaching Croshere the nuances of the game that once gave his beloved Lakers fits in the finals. Developing a step-back jumper, a resourceful nature around the rim and an edge that made him go nose-to-nose with Derek Fisher the other night, his style has resembled parts of Bird's game.</p>
        <p>Over time, the conversion became complete. The Showtime kid absorbed the lessons of an old Celtic, eventually morphing from a soft Venice Beach pick-up player into the 25-year-old veteran who lowers his shoulder on his way to the rim.</p>
        <p>When he takes the court for the Pacers in Game 4 of the finals tonight, Croshere will do so with the knowledge that Bird was not all bad, after all.</p>
        <p>''I took a long time, but I feel like I've grown a lot under him and I hope he feels the same way,'' Croshere said. ''He and I have a different relationship.''</p>
        <p>Croshere understood early on that Bird cared about his progress. One of their first memorable encounters came the night he scored his first N.B.A. basket, in the fall of 1997. After the game, as he was about to get on the team charter bus, Bird called him aside for a moment.</p>
        <p>''Austin, you forgot this,'' he said, handing Croshere the game ball he had safely put away after Croshere's basket. ''Congratulations.''</p>
        <p>Bird doesn't give Croshere effusive praise, but there are moments when he sounds like a proud father whose son is about to leave for college.</p>
        <p>''He's very inconsistent,'' Bird said. ''But the one thing about him, the kid plays hard. He plays as hard he can out there. He spends a lot of time working on his game.''</p>
        <p>Croshere gave up most of his Lakers paraphernalia after Magic Johnson retired and after he became a Big East star at Providence. How indoctrinated is he now to Bird's world? Croshere recently took in a local high school game, just to get the feel for Hoosier hysteria.</p>
        <p>Asked about on-the-floor altercations, Croshere said, ''I mean, you can't win an N.B.A. finals letting guys go in for uncontested layups and playing soft.''</p>
        <p>The Showtime kid, broken down and remolded for the finals by an old Celtic, one verbal barb at a time.</p>
