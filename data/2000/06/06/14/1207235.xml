        <p>My dad never went to high school. His father, a lumberjack in Stillwater, Minn., died going through the ice with a team of horses. Dad was in the eighth grade at the time and went to work as the third cook and dishwasher at a lumber camp.

        <p>My dad never went to high school. His father, a lumberjack in Stillwater, Minn., died going through the ice with a team of horses. Dad was in the eighth grade at the time and went to work as the third cook and dishwasher at a lumber camp. The men slept on straw in wooden bunks, and every Friday, Dad emptied the straw and burned it -- it was full of lice -- and then hosed off the bunks. It was a hard life.</p>
        <p>Eventually, he got a job at a power company as a timekeeper and worked his way up to the cashier department. He was smart, a voracious reader, but it was no position to speak of. He ended up with a passion for educating his children. He kept telling us, ''You've got to get some degrees behind you.'' The passion grew as he got older. Once a week, he sat next to a tax-and-business attorney on the streetcar on his way to work. He'd come home and talk about how wonderful the guy's job was. What I didn't realize was that he was recruiting me to be a lawyer.</p>
        <p>When I went to the University of Minnesota, I knew two things: I wanted to be a lawyer and I needed to play professional football to earn the money to go to law school. I played football at Minnesota; I think eight guys on the team went on to law school. I figure they thought, ''If that dumb S.O.B. can do it, so can I.''</p>
        <p>I started law school in my fourth year at Minnesota. I showed up a week later than everybody else, and I didn't have a clue what they were talking about in class. I got so confused that when I went to football practice I couldn't remember my locker number or combination. I ran scared as hell for the first semester. But I saw later that some of the most articulate kids in class never made it to the second year.</p>
        <p>I played pro football in Canada under Bud Grant. My nickname was McGoo; I had very bad vision under the lights and was always squinting. If I saw something with a different color, I knocked it down.</p>
        <p>The day I graduated from law school, Dad said, one, ''Congratulations,'' and two, ''Now you gotta figure out a way to go to Harvard Business School.'' I said, ''No way.''</p>
        <p>I worked for a law firm for a time. When I was offered a job at Supervalu as senior vice president, Dad was the most unhappy guy in the world. He wanted me to practice law. Even after I became president, he still wouldn't accept it.</p>
        <p>What's it like running the country's biggest grocery wholesaler? My kids will ask me, ''How do you do it?'' It's a little like football practice: you're banging your head and banging your head; if you stopped and thought about it, you might not do it. But football also taught me not to take myself too seriously. Here, everybody from top management to the cleaning staff calls me Mike. We work hard at fighting egos.</p>
        <p>I go grocery shopping about once a week at one of our own retail stores or one that is run by a distribution customer. I concentrate on the perishable areas. Does it look fresh? How clean is it? Are the employees friendly? I'm probably more intense than the average shopper.</p>
        <p>There's never a dull moment in this business. I believe that 10 years from now, a meter in your shopping cart will record the price of each item you put in and the total bill, and you'll be able to leave through an electronic gate without waiting in line. People like to shop, but they hate waiting in line.</p>
        <p>I was the 1999 recipient of the Horatio Alger award. Coming from my background, I couldn't agree more with the philosophy of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. The key for young people is education. When I see kids dropping out of school, it breaks my heart.</p>
