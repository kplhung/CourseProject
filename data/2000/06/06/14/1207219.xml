        <p>THE summer wine catalogs are out, and it looks as if the 1998 Petrus will open at about $1,000 a bottle when it arrives here next year. A few serious margin calls could change that very quickly; the markup is four and five times what the winemaker sells it for, so there is a lot of fat in that price to be trimmed.

        <p>THE summer wine catalogs are out, and it looks as if the 1998 Petrus will open at about $1,000 a bottle when it arrives here next year. A few serious margin calls could change that very quickly; the markup is four and five times what the winemaker sells it for, so there is a lot of fat in that price to be trimmed. But if the stock market doesn't crash, collectors will be eager to shell out $10,000 or so for one of the 2,200 cases made.</p>
        <p>Many will gladly pay double that amount to have the magic Petrus name in their cellar books. The danger inherent in these bizarre prices is that consumers will assume that any wine that costs less offers less.</p>
        <p>I have not tasted the 1998 Petrus, but then I am not very good with wines in their infancy. I have tasted probably 60 vintages of Petrus over the years, though, and accept unreservedly the reports that this two-year-old is a very great wine indeed.</p>
        <p>There are of course dozens, quite possibly hundreds, of small Bordeaux selling for $8 to $12 that offer good value in stark contrast to the hype that has become part of the  Petrus image. But what is there for the wine lover who wants the complexity, the richness and the elegance that fine Bordeaux has to offer, but who has neither the means nor the desire to engage in the wretched excess that characterizes the market? And that goes not just for superstar Bordeaux wines, but also for famous Burgundies and top-of-the-line California wines.</p>
        <p>There are classic wines to be found, many in the $30 to $50 range, with the power and finesse to put them among or close to the very best.</p>
        <p>In Bordeaux, the 1998 vintage has been described as the best since 1990, especially in the wines of Pomerol and St. Emilion. But 1995 was an outstanding vintage all over Bordeaux, and what's more, most of the 1995's are ready to drink. From Pomerol, look for Clos de l'Eglise, a small property whose wines are often lighter than other Pomerols but just as full flavored. The 1995 has a lovely bouquet and should be at its peak over the next three or four years. About $35.</p>
        <p>Another 1995 Pomerol to seek out is Chateau de Sales, from a fairly large property just north of the small city of Libourne. This is a soft, attractive wine with deep color, muted acidity and succulent fruit. It is at its best now and should stay at its peak for another five years. About $30.</p>
        <p>Les Fiefs de Lagrange is the second wine of Chateau Lagrange in St.-Julien, in the Medoc. (There is a Lagrange in Pomerol, but this is the more famous of the two.) The origins of the St.-Julien Lagrange go back to the 13th century. After years of neglect, it was purchased in 1983 by Suntory, the Japanese spirits company, which proceeded to restore it. In some years, almost half of the grape crop goes into this second wine, which often seems to equal Lagrange itself. The 1995, which I first tasted in San Francisco several years ago, was concentrated and tannic. Now, the wine has smoothed out and is delicious to drink. It will continue to improve, however, for another five years. About $30.</p>
        <p>Chateau Lynch-Bages, Jean-Michel Cazes's home and principal wine property, has long been one of the most popular of the best Bordeaux, competing with and occasionally surpassing some of the first and second growths, even though it is ranked as a fifth growth in the 1855 classification. The 1995 was judged to be lighter than several good earlier vintages like 1990, but it seems now to display the classic Lynch-Bages opulence and sweetness. A beautiful wine. About $70.</p>
        <p>For anyone who simply must have a first growth but is not equipped to pay $300 for a 1995 Chateau Latour or Lafite-Rothschild, I would suggest the 1994 Latour at around $175. Although 1994 was not a great year in Bordeaux, Latour, in any year the chateau in Pauillac chooses to make it, is a great wine, and this one is no exception. It is a well-structured wine that is just now coming together as an intense, silky wine.</p>
        <p>Chateau Phelan Segur, an old favorite of mine, did not make the cut in the 1855 classification; it is listed as a Cru Grand Bourgeois Exceptionnel, which sounds grander than it actually is. Nevertheless, this big property in St. Estephe has been turning out exceptional wines since it was purchased by the Gardinier family, from Champagne, in 1986. The Gardiniers, who used to own Champagne houses, derive a considerable part of their income from orange groves in Florida.</p>
        <p>Phelan Segur, like any good St. Estephe, is a dense, solid wine, never hard but rarely as soft as a St.-Julien or as velvety as a fine Margaux. It has gone from strength to strength in recent years and can rival better-known wines from the same commune like Lafon-Rochet, Les Ormes de Pez and Meyney. The 1995 is hard to find; the 1997 is about $25.</p>
        <p>Finally, for the hopelessly star-struck, there is Lafite-Rothschild. Well, not quite Lafite-Rothschild, but the chateau's second wine, Carruades de Lafite. The Carruades is a plateau southwest of the chateau, which Lafite shares with its neighbor Mouton-Rothschild. But the wine comes from an amalgam of Lafite's younger vines and not necessarily just from the Carruades.</p>
        <p>Lafite had a series of exceptional vintages in the last half of the 1990's, and the Carruades shared in that good fortune. Selection is severe, even for this second wine, with much of it sold simply as Pauillac. Carruades does not have Lafite's intensity, but in good years it is an elegant, rounded wine with a memorable bouquet. The 1995, still available, sells for about $50; the 1996 for about $40.</p>
        <p>For anyone interested in wine futures, it's possible to lock in the highly praised 1998 Carruades at under $30 a bottle. A bargain? Absolutely, but we're talking about the Rothschilds here -- let's call it a wise indulgence.</p>
