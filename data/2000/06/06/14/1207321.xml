        <p>Editorial urges swift New York City police probe of charges by women assaulted by roving mob of young men in Central Park that officers they approached to report attacks did nothing; notes swift intervention might have prevented further assaults</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>New Yorkers were rightfully outraged when they learned that a roving mob of young men assaulted several women in Central Park early Sunday evening, just after the annual Puerto Rican National Day parade. A televised videotape that showed the mob reveling in these savage attacks was horrifying enough. But the rampage took on an even more disturbing cast when victims charged that police officers whom they had approached to report the attacks did nothing -- at a time when swift intervention might have prevented further assaults. Besides bringing the assailants to justice, the Police Department needs to determine as swiftly as possible which officers performed honorably and which did not. It must punish any who violated the public trust by ignoring pleas for help.</p>
        <p>The portrait of Sunday evening is not yet complete, but the mob seems to have included between 20 and 50 young men who attacked about 20 women, fondling and attempting to undress many of them. Typically, the young men approached the women, doused them with water, forced them to the ground and tried to remove their clothing. In addition to being fondled and violated, several of the women were robbed.</p>

        <p>New Yorkers were rightfully outraged when they learned that a roving mob of young men assaulted several women in Central Park early Sunday evening, just after the annual Puerto Rican National Day parade. A televised videotape that showed the mob reveling in these savage attacks was horrifying enough. But the rampage took on an even more disturbing cast when victims charged that police officers whom they had approached to report the attacks did nothing -- at a time when swift intervention might have prevented further assaults. Besides bringing the assailants to justice, the Police Department needs to determine as swiftly as possible which officers performed honorably and which did not. It must punish any who violated the public trust by ignoring pleas for help.</p>
        <p>The portrait of Sunday evening is not yet complete, but the mob seems to have included between 20 and 50 young men who attacked about 20 women, fondling and attempting to undress many of them. Typically, the young men approached the women, doused them with water, forced them to the ground and tried to remove their clothing. In addition to being fondled and violated, several of the women were robbed.</p>
        <p>The attacks took place on the southern rim of the park, just off Avenue of the Americas -- a block west of where the Puerto Rican National Day parade was winding down. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani took pains to say that the attacks were not associated with the parade, but some victims said the crowd at the eastern edge of the park along the parade route had been out of control, and that young men were harassing and groping women who passed by.</p>
        <p>A young woman who said she had been attacked while skating in the park told reporters she had fought off her assailants and sought out the police, only to have them ignore her request that they radio for help and get control of an ugly crowd. Another woman, the mother of one of two teenagers who were attacked, told reporters the police had ignored her daughter's cries and had merely pointed to a nearby ambulance.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir have noted that the police cannot be everywhere and have urged New Yorkers to keep this crime in perspective. They remind us that crime in New York is at its lowest level in decades and that Central Park is statistically one of the safest places in the city. But the mayor and the commissioner surely understand that an event of this magnitude, unfolding in the most public of public places, can outweigh the effect of mere statistics in the public consciousness.</p>
