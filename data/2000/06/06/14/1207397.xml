        <p>LAWRENCE-Jacob. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art are deeply saddened by the passing of Jacob Lawrence. More than merely chronicling the experiences of African Americans, Lawrence recorded his prospective in imagery that blended forceful modern abstraction with unflinching particularity. In later years he was a venerable and venerated spokesman for the civic community from which he emerged and for the aesthetic one he had joined as a modern artist. We send our most profound condolences to his wife, Gwendolyn Knight Lawrence. Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Agnes Gund, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art</p>
