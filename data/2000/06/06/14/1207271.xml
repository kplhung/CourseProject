        <p>In a major victory for SBC Communications Inc., the Justice Department recommended yesterday that the company, the nation's biggest local phone carrier, be allowed to sell long-distance communications services to its almost 15 million customers in Texas.</p>
        <p>If the Federal Communications Commission agrees with the recommendation, as expected, SBC will become the second regional Bell company allowed into the $80 billion long-distance market. In December, the Bell Atlantic Corporation was permitted to begin selling long-distance services to its customers in New York.</p>
        <p>''We are pleased that the Department of Justice has concluded that our application to provide long-distance service in Texas meets every one of the Telecom Act's checklist items and should be approved by the F.C.C.,'' Priscilla Hill-Ardoin, senior vice president for federal regulatory affairs at SBC, said in a statement. ''This is a big win for our customers, who can expect increased competition, more choices and lower prices if our application is approved by the F.C.C.''</p>
        <p>In the telecommunications business, the approval of the SBC petition, coming after Bell Atlantic's success, would probably be taken as a sign that the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which was intended to loosen many communications regulations, is finally bearing consistent fruit.</p>
        <p>Of course, that fruit is far sweeter for some than for others. For the Bell companies, the long-distance telephone market is still like the promised land, an arena for them to leverage their tens of millions of customer relationships into big new revenue streams. For the long-distance incumbents, like AT&amp;T, Worldcom and Sprint, the Bells' entry into their domain is a creeping disaster.</p>
        <p>The disaster is surely coming; the only question is how quickly. Luckily for the long-distance companies, the Bells' long-distance aspirations are not very close to being fulfilled in any other states.</p>
        <p>The telecommunications act opened a path through many of the regulatory barriers that were placed around the Bell companies when they split from the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1984.</p>
        <p>Many communications experts feared that the Bell companies would unfairly exploit their local telephone dominance in the long-distance market. So, the act stated that the Bells must convince the F.C.C., state by state, that they had opened their local communications networks to competitors. As simple as that may sound, the process of ''opening'' decades-old communications networks to outsiders is actually complicated, because it involves having the Bells make their own systems available to outsiders.</p>
        <p>If an independent company, for instance, wants to provide high-speed Internet access using digital subscriber line technology, that company almost always has to contract with the local telephone incumbent, usually a Bell company, for the use of that copper line. The incumbent, meanwhile, is generally trying to sell digital subscriber line service on its own. So, for the Bell company to win long-distance approval, it must convince regulators that it is providing those lines to outsiders at roughly the same rate at which it is providing those sorts of lines to its own digital subscriber line subsidiary.</p>
        <p>Of course, the competitive local communications providers (as well as the long-distance giants) routinely say that the Bells are not really cooperating with outsiders to open their networks, even as the Bells say they are. As a result, extensive testing, generally supervised by the state's public utility commission, is required.</p>
        <p>That can take a long time. SBC filed its original petition to offer long-distance service in Texas two years ago. Bell Atlantic waited a year longer than it originally anticipated to get into the long-distance arena in New York as the company tried to appease New York regulators.</p>
        <p>New York and Texas were always considered the two states most likely to lead the way for the Bells into the long-distance market. The Justice Department and the F.C.C. have not split on a long-distance petition and do not seem likely to do so now. The Justice Department added some minor caveats to its approval, but it would be a big surprise if the commission rejected SBC's petition now.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, the BellSouth Corporation appears to be serious about going through the hard work of opening its networks in Georgia. And Bell Atlantic is working on opening its systems in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. But in none of those three states is long-distance approval likely to be granted before Thanksgiving, analysts say.</p>
