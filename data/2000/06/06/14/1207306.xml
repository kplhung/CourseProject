        <p>A man stabbed his wife and mother-in-law to death, then held his 9-year-son hostage for four hours in the family's house here today, before letting the boy go and surrendering to the police, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The man, Ali Kemoum, 49, a native of Algeria who lived with his son, his wife and her mother in the house at 511 Lake Street, was a chemist by profession but had been working as a security guard, and officials said stress arising from his financial and job difficulties might have motivated the killings.</p>
        <p>''We had some information from some people in the family that there were some tensions over money, finances, his inability to find work in his profession,'' said Joseph Santiago, Newark's police director.</p>
        <p>The victims, Amada Teresa Dominguez, 54, a dentist who had her office in the white-shingled house, and her mother, Carmen Dominguez, 74, both originally from Ecuador, were found dead in the house's first-floor kitchen, Mr. Santiago said. He said their throats had been slit.</p>
        <p>The boy, Ali Gregory Kemoum, appeared to be physically unharmed but was taken to University Hospital in Newark for observation after his father released him before 1 p.m. The boy and two officers made a frantic dash away from the house, racing across a neighbor's lawn and across the street.</p>
        <p>About an hour later, Mr. Kemoum surrendered and was escorted from the front door into a patrol car that whisked him away. He was charged with two counts of murder, as well as kidnapping and possession of a knife for unlawful purposes.</p>
        <p>Officials said the standoff began after the police received a 7:58 a.m. call from an off-duty Newark firefighter and a construction worker, who had seen the boy run from the house only to be caught and brought back by his father, who the construction worker said had blood on his hands.</p>
        <p>Officers forced open the back door leading to the kitchen, where they found the women's bodies, the police said. The officers also smelled gas and heard footsteps on the stairs, prompting them to leave the house, call for backup and evacuate the  houses on either side.</p>
        <p>When the police first spoke to Mr. Kemoum -- from an upstairs landing as Mr. Kemoum and the boy were in a bedroom -- he demanded to be interviewed on television. Officers confiscated a New Jersey Network video camera for two hours, and kept the tape that was in it.</p>
        <p>Mayor Sharpe James later apologized for the confiscation, but he said the police thought it was necessary for officers to pose as reporters to keep Mr. Kemoum engaged and thus prevent him from doing anything drastic.</p>
        <p>A friend of the family, Oswaldo Carrion, 51, of Newark, a dental technician who made dentures for Ms. Dominguez's patients, said he was shocked by the day's events.</p>
        <p>''He's a very nice person,'' Mr. Carrion said. ''She's a nice person, too. They had a good relationship.''</p>
        <p>The neighborhood, which runs along Essex County's sprawling Branch Brook Park, is one of Newark's most stable and best maintained, although one where neighbors can be reluctant to share their problems, said Rosilio Otilia, who has lived there for six years.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes, when this type of problem comes around, people don't say anything,'' Ms. Otilia said.</p>
        <p>Another neighbor, Rosemary Valente, 51, a teacher's aide in the Newark school system, said she was worried about the boy. ''He lost his mother, he's going to lose his father, he has no grandmother,'' she said. ''I wonder who will take care of him.''</p>
