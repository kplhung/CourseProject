        <p>There sat Jimmy Connors, suntanned, not a gray hair in sight and still looking like tennis's original bad boy. Across the aisle was his petulant heir John McEnroe, looking a tad annoyed by the hullabaloo that accompanied his arrival on the all-star dais of senior-circuit tennis pros. Flanking him were Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander, projecting their usual air of separation from it all.</p>

        <p>There sat Jimmy Connors, suntanned, not a gray hair in sight and still looking like tennis's original bad boy.

        <p>Yesteryear returned to New York yesterday, bringing back those other boys of summer for the season-ending championship of the men's senior tennis tournament at the Wollman Rink in Central Park. The opening-round match of the round-robin tournament between Connors and Wilander was postponed because of wet conditions. Tournament officials said the match would be played later in the week.</p>
        <p>So what if the caliber of play fails to live up to the storied matches of the past between the players who dominated the men's professional tennis circuit in the 1970's and 1980's.</p>
        <p>''The players on the seniors circuit are so much better known than the younger players,'' Henry Stern, New York City's parks commissioner, said at a news conference yesterday afternoon at the Intercontinental Hotel. ''It should draw a big crowd.''</p>
        <p>Connors came up with the idea of a tour for players age 35 and older who were no longer active on the ATP tour. The first year, 1993, the tour included three events. The Champions Tour is now a 21-event tour held in places like London, Paris and Tokyo. The season finale runs through Sunday.</p>
        <p>''From where we started eight years ago, it certainly has gone in the right direction and hopefully will continue to go in that direction,'' Connors said.</p>
