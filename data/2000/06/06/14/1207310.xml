        <p>With Woody Allen standing in the back row of the hearing like a theatergoer too anxious to sit through the final scene of a long-running drama, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission rejected plans yesterday for a 17-story apartment tower that Mr. Allen and dozens of other Upper East Side residents had opposed.</p>
        <p>One after another, the 11 commissioners said they felt that the proposed building was too tall for the site, on the corner of Madison Avenue and East 91st Street in the Carnegie Hill Historic District.</p>

        <p>With Woody Allen standing in the back row of the hearing like a theatergoer too anxious to sit through the final scene of a long-running drama, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission rejected plans yesterday for a 17-story apartment tower that Mr. Allen and dozens of other Upper East Side residents had opposed.</p>
        <p>One after another, the 11 commissioners said they felt that the proposed building was too tall for the site, on the corner of Madison Avenue and East 91st Street in the Carnegie Hill Historic District.</p>
        <p>''Size matters,'' the commission's chairwoman, Jennifer J. Raab, said after announcing the decision in a crowded hearing room at City Hall. ''Not the size of the crowd but the size of the building. This is not about lopping off a few floors; it is about designing a contextual building.''</p>
        <p>But the commission left open the possibility that the developer could submit a different design, and several commissioners suggested a building of about six stories atop the existing one-story bank branch.</p>
        <p>''Though several commissioners referred to that kind of height,'' said Robert S. Davis, a lawyer for the developers, ''it's not clear they were prescribing. But the comments from the commissioners were very thorough, and our job now is to think about those comments and, in a new proposed design, be responsive to them.''</p>
        <p>In explaining their reasons for rejecting the tower, most commissioners said they believed that it would be out of character in the largely residential neighborhood, a point that Mr. Allen made in a video opposing the project that he submitted to the commission in March.</p>
        <p>''We believe the applicants failed to consider the sense of place in that historic district,'' Ms. Raab said.</p>
        <p>The streetscape, she said, is dominated by four- and six-story town houses. Though she did not mention it, one of the town houses behind the site is the one to which Mr. Allen moved last year. He not only made his film about the neighborhood, he also testified against the tower at a commission hearing in February.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Allen stood silently as Ms. Raab called the meeting to order. His expression did not change when she announced the decision, and he did not join other opponents in applauding. But he said after the meeting that he was pleased with the ruling by the commissioners.</p>
        <p>''They did what they were supposed to do, bearing responsibility for the preservation of New York City,'' he said. ''They made a very responsible decision.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen also said he had no objections to a shorter, scaled-down building. ''That's reasonable,'' Mr. Allen said. ''It's really the size of the building that was the problem. No one's really against development. It's if it's consistent with the neighborhood and if it isn't a sudden eyesore.''</p>
        <p>The fight over the building pitted neighbor against neighbor -- the architect who designed the tower, Charles A. Platt, can see the site from his dining-room window. Nor was Mr. Allen the only celebrity to oppose the project.</p>
        <p>Peggy Noonan, the author and former White House speechwriter, appeared before the commission last month. Sir Howard Stringer, the chairman of the Sony Corporation of America, testified earlier in the year, as did others recruited by Jurate Kazickas, who lives with her husband, Roger C. Altman, the former deputy treasury secretary, a block from the site.</p>
        <p>''We're elated, of course,'' said Carol McFadden, another neighborhood opponent. ''There's hope for charm and elegance and character and scale. The confidence with which the developers went into it was frightening. It was David against Goliath, and you don't think there's a stone in your sling, but there was -- the Landmarks Commission.''</p>
        <p>Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, whose Congressional district includes the site, testified against the proposed building earlier in the year. Yesterday, she cheered the decision, as did City Councilwoman Eva S. Moskowitz.</p>
        <p>The developer, the Tamarkin Company, bought the right to build above the one-story bank branch on the corner of Madison Avenue and 91st Street. The owners of a town house next door also sold Tamarkin their air rights, allowing the developer to increase the height of the proposed building by five floors.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Raab, the chairwoman, said the commission had rejected the developers' claim ''that because there are some tall buildings in the district, therefore a building of this size is appropriate for the lot.''</p>
        <p>The Tamarkin building was planned for a 68-by-68-foot lot, she noted. ''By comparison,'' Ms. Raab said, ''the other tall buildings along Madison Avenue within the district are sited on significantly larger lots.''</p>
