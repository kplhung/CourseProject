        <p>SOME American foods inspire pride, like the hamburger. Others, like baloney, have to be accepted as a fact of life. And still others are downright embarrassing. Foreigners wonder about them, and Americans have no good answer ready. Wonder Bread falls in this category. So does American cheese. And then there's iceberg lettuce.</p>
        <p>Short of heating up a TV dinner, there are few more blatantly retro gestures than ordering a wedge of iceberg lettuce covered in a thick, creamy salad dressing. The lettuce itself remains popular in the United States. It still accounts for 70 percent of the lettuce raised in California, but that share is declining (in the mid-1970's it was as high as 80 percent), and anyone dining at fancier restaurants around the United States might wonder if it hadn't disappeared entirely, displaced by frisee, dandelion greens, oak leaf, lollo rosso, exotic cresses, microgreens, sprouts -- anything, in short, that's green, has a leaf, and is not iceberg.</p>

        <p>SOME American foods inspire pride, like the hamburger. Others, like baloney, have to be accepted as a fact of life. And still others are downright embarrassing. Foreigners wonder about them, and Americans have no good answer ready. Wonder Bread falls in this category. So does American cheese. And then there's iceberg lettuce.</p>
        <p>Short of heating up a TV dinner, there are few more blatantly retro gestures than ordering a wedge of iceberg lettuce covered in a thick, creamy salad dressing. The lettuce itself remains popular in the United States. It still accounts for 70 percent of the lettuce raised in California, but that share is declining (in the mid-1970's it was as high as 80 percent), and anyone dining at fancier restaurants around the United States might wonder if it hadn't disappeared entirely, displaced by frisee, dandelion greens, oak leaf, lollo rosso, exotic cresses, microgreens, sprouts -- anything, in short, that's green, has a leaf, and is not iceberg.</p>
        <p>But iceberg somehow manages to hang on. Steakhouses refuse to give it up. And in some very unlikely places, it has earned a strange kind of cachet. At Thalia, Michael Otsuka, an imaginative chef with an Asian-inspired vocabulary, seems more at home with seaweed than with lettuce, but his bar menu includes a real surprise: iceberg lettuce, served chilled in the classic wedge, with a thick Roquefort dressing and a grinding of fresh pepper. A few radish sprouts remind diners that they are at Thalia, not Howard Johnson's.</p>
        <p>''It's one of those things that's synonymous with growing up in America,'' Mr. Otsuka said. ''Everybody has a comfort level with it. Served cold, it's very nice on the palate, with a good crunch.''</p>
        <p>Marc Meyer, at Five Points, anoints a wedge of the stuff with a modernized, Europeanized blue cheese dressing made with picon cheese from Spain, toasted almond slices and radishes. The Lenox Room offers a very unusual hybrid, mesclun greens served in an iceberg lettuce cup with sherry vinaigrette. Most startling of all is the treatment at Blue Hill, where thin strands of iceberg are woven into an arugula and frisee salad topped with Parmesan shavings. The effect is a little strange, as though Jimmy Stewart had wandered into a French-Italian co-production.</p>
        <p>Despite its shortcomings, iceberg has always had its fans. James Beard was one. ''Many people damn it,'' he once wrote, ''but when broken up, not cut, it adds good flavor and a wonderfully crisp texture to a salad with other greens.'' It also keeps longer than other lettuces, he pointed out. Flavor? Surely the iceberg stands supreme as the blandest of all greens. Little pieces? Most Americans side with the prim instructions given in the first ''Joy of Cooking.'' ''Heads of iceberg lettuce are not separated,'' the directions read. ''They are cut into wedge-shaped pieces, or into crosswise slices.''</p>
        <p>The lettuce is a relative newcomer, and confusingly named. A lettuce that went by the name of iceberg was developed in the 1890's, and somehow the name resurfaced when new varieties of durable, easily shippable crisphead lettuce began emerging in California in the mid-1920's. In 1948, the iceberg we know today was born.</p>
        <p>Why iceberg? No one seems to know, although one popular theory holds that the name refers to the tons of ice that chilled it in the days before refrigerated rail cars.</p>
        <p>The big, cold wedge is a cornerstone of American cuisine. It survives, and so do the sludgelike dressings that drape it like heavy velvet curtains -- the great, goopy family that includes blue cheese, green goddess, ranch and Thousand Island. I went for the wedge the other day at Del Frisco Double Eagle Steak House. It arrived under a lavalike green ooze, a creamily high-caloric green goddess dressing lumpy with tender bits of avocado.</p>
        <p>It took me back. Way back, to an America that had never heard the words ''arugula,'' ''bibb'' or ''vinaigrette.'' And despite myself, I began to make a case for the despised iceberg. Its cold crunch really has no equivalent in the lettuce world, making it ideal on sandwiches and tacos. And the moisture content is remarkable. With each bite, I felt as though I'd taken a long drink from the glass of water next to my plate.</p>
        <p>I repeated the experiment at Michael Jordan's The Steak House. This time, the wedge wore a blue cheese dressing. It was topped with two tomato wedges, bright red and yellow, and three big Bermuda onion rings. It, too, was strangely satisfying.</p>
        <p>Inspired, I went home and tried to recreate a family dressing, based on Campbell's tomato soup, that impressed me deeply in my formative years. I blended the ingredients -- soup, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, paprika and garlic -- and presented the results, poured over a wedge of iceberg, to my wife. ''You know what this tastes like?'' she said. ''It tastes exactly like the 1950's.'' Success.</p>
        <p>John Schenk, the chef at Clementine, tuned in to this particular frequency years before tony restaurants began playing with iceberg. He caused a minor sensation by serving a wedge with Roquefort dressing livened up with bits of bacon and scallion.</p>
        <p>''It's shocking how well it sold,'' he said.  ''As much as the food professionals hate iceberg, I think there's a cultural relevance to it. Yes, you can eat the finest things, but you also eat to remember, and that's as valid as eating ingredients for their novelty or rarity.''</p>
        <p>It's a little too much to say that eating an iceberg lettuce salad is a way of affirming one's national identity. But it is a distinct cultural marker, one of those little tics that make Americans different from everybody else. And it could be a lot worse. Just think of Vegemite.</p>
        <p>CREAMY BLUE CHEESE DRESSING  Adapted from Michael Jordan's The Steak House  Time: 10 minutes, plus 1 hour for chilling</p>
        <p>1 cup mayonnaise  1 pound blue cheese, crumbled</p>
        <p>1/2 cup sour cream</p>
        <p>3/4 cup heavy cream  2 tablespoons lemon juice  1 teaspoon lemon zest  2 teaspoons kosher salt  1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper  Iceberg lettuce.</p>
        <p>1. In the work bowl of a food processor, add mayonnaise, about  3/4 of the blue cheese, the sour cream, heavy cream and lemon juice. Process until smooth.</p>
        <p>2. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl, and add the remaining blue cheese, lemon zest, salt and pepper. Adjust seasonings, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Serve over wedges of iceberg lettuce.</p>
        <p>Yield: 3 1/2 cups dressing.</p>
