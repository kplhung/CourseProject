        <p>As the orchestra of teenage musicians completed its first piece Saturday night, Dr. Paula S. Washington, the slim, dark-haired conductor, looking much as she must have 30 years ago when she graduated from high school, smiled and waved at her former classmates in the audience.</p>
        <p>The piece's composer, Albert Glinsky, a now-graying member of the same class, rose and bowed excitedly. And 800 alumni burst into applause for a school that had nurtured them in the arts, though, in most cases, not in the school building they remembered.</p>
        <p>For years, a Gothic-style hilltop tower on 135th Street was home to the High School of Music and Art, while 90 blocks to the south, just off Times Square, the High School of Performing Arts housed dancers and actors in a building that had once sheltered circus elephants.</p>
        <p>Both could claim stellar alumni: the singer Liza Minnelli, the actor Al Pacino, the playwright Herb Gardner and the designer Isaac Mizrahi attended Performing Arts; Music and Art's graduates included the graphic designer Milton Glaser, the writer Erica Jong, the soprano Catherine Malfitano, the popular singers Diahann Carroll and Peter Yarrow, and Max Frankel, the former executive editor of The New York Times.</p>
        <p>In 1984, the two schools merged into Fiorello H. La Guardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, housed in a spare, modern building near Lincoln Center. There was tension around the merger, as students and educators worried about eroding standards and a blurring of identity.</p>
        <p>Last weekend, though, as alumni of a number of classes from 1940 to 1990 gathered for a reunion, it seemed a truce had been reached. Performing Arts graduates wandered with their Music and Art counterparts through the eight-story, $90 million building.</p>
        <p>Some shared a wistful nostalgia for their old schools, which they described as more intimate than today's 2,400-student structure. But they marveled at its spacious dance studios and the state-of-the-art concert hall, much of it paid for by alumni and other supporters, who maintain a $2.3 million endowment. And anyone who asked might have been impressed by indicators that suggest the school is on the upswing.</p>
        <p>Twelve thousand prospective dance, drama, voice, instrumental and visual arts majors applied for 600 slots this year, up almost 50 percent since 1990. And Paul Saronson, the school's principal since 1987, said the percentage of students passing Regents examinations has risen  in the last decade.</p>
        <p>Some cite a change in admissions criteria. ''Fifteen years ago it seemed La Guardia would take the brilliant graffiti artist who didn't have good grades,'' said Joseph Cassidy, principal of the Clinton School, a middle school that sends many students to La Guardia. ''In the last 5 to 10 years they're also taking into account grades and attendance.'' Often, he added, ''there's kids who could go to Stuyvesant or Bronx Science, but who choose to go to La Guardia.''</p>
        <p>Students who attend today also speak proudly of an ethnic makeup that mirrors the city's; the student body is 38 percent white, 25 percent black, 20 percent Hispanic, and 16.5 percent Asian.</p>
        <p>''It's really mixed here, which is good for teenagers,'' said Michelle Smith, a dance major and Presidential Scholar who will attend Julliard School in the fall. Noting that her junior high school was mostly black and Hispanic, she said, ''Here you have to stay away from stereotypes because you really get to know people.''</p>
        <p>The tale of two schools began in 1936 when Mayor Fiorello La Guardia called for a public school for art and music. Twelve years later, a smaller school was established for dance and drama. Both selected students by audition or portfolio, yet standards for academic subjects were high, too.</p>
        <p>''Talented children are very often talented in a number of areas,'' said Barbara Pollard, who taught English at Music and Art and now teaches at La Guardia.</p>
        <p>Often there was crossing over after graduation, with music students becoming actors and drama students becoming singers. But friction existed between the two schools.</p>
        <p>''We looked down our noses at them and they looked down their noses at us,'' said Ms. Pollard, who was a 1953 Performing Arts graduate. ''We were the professionals; they were the dabblers.''</p>
        <p>For their part, Music and Art students touted their school's high academic standards, which older alumni say ranked with those at Stuyvesant, Bronx Science and Brooklyn Technical.</p>
        <p>Both groups spoke lovingly of schools that felt like family, with students reluctant to leave at the end of the day. Nobody recalled anyone pirouetting on lunchroom tables as in the movie ''Fame,'' which was based mostly on Performing Arts, but their memories of dancing, painting and singing their way through adolescence often sounded like the stuff of which movies are made.</p>
        <p>''If we'd gone to some suburban high school in Des Moines we would have been the weird ones, the fat girl who liked poetry, or the nerdy guy who was gifted at music,'' said Susan Levitt Stamberg, a 1955 Music and Art graduate and a creator of National Public Radio's ''All Things Considered.'' ''But we were all like that. And here was a school that was out to protect, nurture and burnish us.''</p>
        <p>Many teachers and alumni spoke of a dip in academic standards in the 1960's and 1970's. Some said the increasingly rough neighborhoods in Harlem and Times Square scared off middle-class parents; others pointed to an overall decline in city schools. And while alumni of earlier classes said they had felt completely prepared for college, some members of more recent classes disagreed.</p>
        <p>''It had been so easy to pass,'' said Samantha Edwards, class of 1985. ''I was in A.P. classes here,'' she said, referring to advanced placement classes, ''but when I got to college I got a hard lesson in what it means to study.''</p>
        <p>The merger, which had been in the works for years, finally took place in 1984. ''It was kind of a shotgun wedding,'' said Mr. Saronson. ''There was tension between the two studios, people not wanting to be here, different school colors. One of the first things I did when I became principal was figure out what would be La Guardia's school colors.''</p>
        <p>Penny Frank, who teaches dance, recalled a ''hateful decision to have two valedictorians and two salutatorians because they thought that the Performing Arts kids couldn't possibly keep up with the Music and Art kids. A year or two later, when they stopped doing that, both valedictorian and salutatorian ended up being Performing Arts kids.'' But even then, she said, ''it took four years before M. and A. and P.A. became La Guardia.''</p>
        <p>Today, the school day is long, with three or four periods spent in studios, and five devoted to academics. Venita Ellis, a dean of students, said that with so much emphasis on each student's art, discipline problems are negligible.</p>
        <p>Current students say they feel no distinction between the dance and drama side and the music and art side. And, as alumni of the separate schools packed the house for this weekend's performances and exhibitions, even the die-hards seemed to have come around.</p>
        <p>''I had one donor who said she would only give to Music and Art,'' said Connie Boykan, director of the school office that handles donations. ''I said, 'We don't work that way.' I sent her on a tour of the school with a Performing Arts student and when she came back, she said the money can go anywhere. All they have to do is see the kids in action.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 23, 2000, Friday  An article on June 14 about the Fiorello H. La Guardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts referred imprecisely to the school's alumni office. Although the Alumni and Friends of La Guardia Inc. is allowed to use an office inside the school, it is a separate tax-exempt organization that is independent of the school, and donations it receives go to the organization, not to the Board of Education.</p>
