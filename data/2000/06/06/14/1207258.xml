        <p>There are two parallel attempts by Marion Jones to win five gold medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics: the publicly hyped effort, and the private struggle to regain her tattered form in the long jump.</p>
        <p>Jones took her only jumps of the year last month in Osaka, Japan, and the distance of 20 feet 7 inches ranks her eighth on the American list and 88th on the world list, nearly 3 feet behind the seasonal best of Fiona May of Italy.

        <p>There are two parallel attempts by Marion Jones to win five gold medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics: the publicly hyped effort, and the private struggle to regain her tattered form in the long jump.</p>
        <p>Jones took her only jumps of the year last month in Osaka, Japan, and the distance of 20 feet 7 inches ranks her eighth on the American list and 88th on the world list, nearly 3 feet behind the seasonal best of Fiona May of Italy. The issue of whether Jones can win a gold medal in the long jump has been supplanted by a more urgent question: Will she even qualify for the Olympics in that event?</p>
        <p>The Olympic trials don't begin until mid-July, but Jones faces a crucial competition on Saturday at her home track at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. Her coach, Trevor Graham, expects her to jump about 23 feet. This would restore her among the world leaders. And it would quiet the howl for Jones to hire an adviser with more expertise in the long jump. Another poor day of jumping would leave her confidence brittle with the trials a month away.</p>
        <p>Graham, in a telephone interview, admitted that he had been listening too much to critics.</p>
        <p>''We tried to please everyone,'' he said. ''We tried to change too much, tried to turn her into a power jumper.''</p>
        <p>Since Osaka, Jones has simplified her jumping style. She is the world's fastest woman, and she will rely on her sprinter's speed to jump far, instead of trying to get a bounding hop on the takeoff board, Graham said. She used this style in 1998 to set a personal best of 23-11 3/4, a distance that would probably win an Olympic gold medal.</p>
        <p>''Marion will use her speed and run right off the board and hang as long as she can and jump far, instead of going scientific,'' Graham said. ''I don't care if she lands on top of her head, as long as she wins and stays healthy. When they criticize her technique, all I'm going to say is, 'Did she win?' ''</p>
        <p>There are experts, however, who believe that Jones, with her 10.65 speed at 100 meters, should be regularly jumping 24 or 25 feet, even 26 feet with a Beamonesque performance, which far exceeds the women's world record of 24-8 1/4. Mike Powell, the men's world record-holder at 29-4 1/2, said he gave Jones his phone number two years ago and that his offer to help still stands.</p>
        <p>''I'm a big fan of hers,'' said Powell, who is now a coach. ''If the world record-holder wants to come and help you, I think it's worth listening to. Obviously, the way she is doing things is not working.''</p>
        <p>In his estimation, Jones's approach is too short and she is not putting her body in a position to jump properly. There is a difference between sprinting and creating a necessary rhythm for converting speed into jumping, Powell said. ''Carl Lewis had the world record in the 100, but he couldn't use all that speed on the runway,'' Powell said.</p>
        <p>Randy Huntington, who coached Powell, said that he had been rebuffed by Jones's husband, the shot-putter C. J. Hunter, when he offered to help several years ago.</p>
        <p>''What is holding her back is coaching,'' Huntington said. ''Obviously, Trevor has done a great job with her sprinting. But the long jump is technical. It's not just running fast and jumping far.''</p>
        <p>Jones said she had ''100 percent faith'' in Graham. ''I'm not going to give up on Trevor; he never gave up on me,'' she said yesterday. Graham, a former Jamaican Olympian as a quarter-miler, is wary of the offers of help. ''They just want a piece of the pie, a great resume,'' he said. ''Everyone is going behind my back. Not once has anyone picked up the phone and called me.''</p>
        <p>He did ask a reporter for the phone number of Tom Tellez, who coached Carl Lewis to four gold medals in the long jump.</p>
        <p>The key with Lewis, Tellez said, was that he took one qualifying jump and two competition jumps in 1984, saving his body from the severe impact of the event, which Lewis likened to ''jumping out of a truck into a pit of sand at 25 miles an hour.'' Lewis lost the 200 meters at the 1988 Summer Olympics, Tellez believes, because he had taken all six attempts in the long jump.</p>
        <p>Jones will have one advantage at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. The long jump final is after the 200 meters, not before. Picking Tellez's brain about preparing for multiple events is a good start. There is no shame in asking for advice. The unfortunate thing would be losing the Olympic long jump because defensiveness and ego restricted brilliant talent.</p>
