        <p>THE Supreme Court blasted a hole in the courtroom assault on managed care this week, pleasing Wall Street, but outside experts and lawyers on both sides in dozens of lawsuits insisted yesterday that there were still plenty of issues left to fight over.</p>
        <p>In a unanimous opinion that was hailed by the industry, the court gave its blessing on Monday to a core practice of managed care insurers: the offering of financial incentives to physicians who limit costs by restricting care. The court rejected arguments that an Illinois health maintenance organization had violated a federal law in the case of Cynthia Herdrich, who said that her H.M.O. doctor delayed treatment for her appendicitis. The justices said her complaint belonged in state court where, in fact, she had won $35,000.</p>
        <p>But the Supreme Court left open whether insurance companies could be punished under a federal pension and health care law for failing to disclose to consumers that they used such incentives and other business methods that affected patient care.</p>
        <p>Stocks of managed care companies, which have been depressed for months, were generally higher on the news. On the New York Stock Exchange, Aetna, which is fighting eight class-action suits, jumped $6.1875 on Monday, then fell back $1.6875 yesterday. The UnitedHealth Group was up $3 Monday and added 85.16 cents yesterday. Cigna gained $2.25 Monday, then $3.3125 more yesterday.</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts said the court decision would assuage investors' concerns about other lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Roberta Goodman, a health care analyst at Merrill Lynch, said, ''The court's ruling and reasoning undercuts the primary arguments of those cases, which said that the financial incentive structure of the health plan was inherently flawed and in conflict with the plans' duty toward their members.''</p>
        <p>James Lane, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, called the decision positive for the industry. But he added that publicity over the litigation would continue and could still damage some of the companies.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the insurance companies said the disclosure issue might also be shut off, if the court agreed to review a Texas case that supported the industry's view that it was acting properly.</p>
        <p>On the other side, spokesmen for a group of prominent class-action lawyers said their suits against big managed care companies like Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Humana, United Healthcare, Cigna, Foundation Health Systems and PacifiCare would be unaffected because their lawsuits were based primarily on the disclosure issue.</p>
        <p>''We were heartened by the Supreme Court discussion of disclosure,'' said Stephen Neuwirth, one of the lawyers who successfully attacked the tobacco industry and who is now suing the insurance companies.</p>
        <p>The class-action lawyers said they would present a consolidated complaint merging six suits against Humana in a federal district court in Miami on Friday. Bruce Wecker, a lawyer in San Francisco, said his coalition, headed by Richard F. Scruggs of Mississippi, was also seeking to put together a single class-action suit in Miami against five or six managed care companies.</p>
        <p>In another case, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia will hear arguments Monday on a civil suit against Aetna under the federal antiracketeering law, a suit that had been dismissed in district court. Experts in health law said none of the managed care suits had yet been certified as class actions.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court decision was ''a serious setback for the class-action plaintiffs' lawyers,'' said William Sage, a health law specialist at Columbia University Law School. He predicted that the Supreme Court would also side with the insurance industry on the disclosure issue in the Texas case, Ehlmann v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plans.</p>
        <p>And Stephanie Kanwit, a Washington lawyer who wrote an industry-sponsored supporting brief in the Supreme Court case, said that if the appellate court in Philadelphia affirmed the rejection of the racketeering claim, ''it will have heavily crippled'' the class-action lawyers.</p>
        <p>Peter D. Jacobson, a health law scholar at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, said the court was ''sending a strong message that as a matter of public policy, managed care and financial incentives to limit care are favored.'' He said ''the tone of the decision'' made him ''very skeptical about the viability of class-action lawsuits'' against managed care companies.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court decision affected only one part, albeit an important one, of a host of attacks on managed care in the courts as well as Congress and state legislatures.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sage at Columbia said that on on the other side, recent court rulings had held health insurance plans responsible for actions by managed care physicians who were found to be negligent. He said the Supreme Court ruling would not change that trend in lawsuits filed on behalf of individuals claiming injuries.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court decision also ''doesn't touch'' a number of managed care lawsuits in state courts, said Edith Kallas, a partner in Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &amp; Lerach in New York. The firm has accused Aetna and Kaiser of deceptive and unfair business practices in state courts in California. It filed a similar accusation against Prudential, which later merged with Aetna, in New York.</p>
        <p>Also in state courts, the American Medical Association has joined with medical societies in New York and Georgia in suits seeking class-action status. In New York, the doctors contended that United Healthcare had lowered their fees in violation of contract provisions.</p>
        <p>Last month, the California Medical Association sued Wellpoint Health Networks, Foundation and PacifiCare under the federal antiracketeering law. In a civil suit, the doctors said the health plans had unfairly lowered fees and had interfered in medical decisions.</p>
        <p>Hospitals have also sued insurers. Last month, 24 hospitals in suburban and upstate New York filed a lawsuit that accused Aetna U.S. Healthcare of violating contracts by routinely delaying payments for services.</p>
