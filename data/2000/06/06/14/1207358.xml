        <p>The continued growth of the Internet and cable television is forcing television programmers to change the way they operate. The Public Broadcasting Service, long resistant to change, is not immune.</p>
        <p>For the first time in its 30-year history, the publicly supported network is experimenting with significantly revamping its national evening schedule.</p>
        <p>Starting this fall, PBS will change its prime-time lineup in seven major markets: Atlanta; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; San Diego; Cleveland; Orlando, Fla.; and Salt Lake City.</p>
        <p>In the test cities, ''Masterpiece Theater,'' which has been shown on Sunday night for 25 years, will move to Monday, swapping places with ''The American Experience.'' ''Nature,'' which has been shown on Sunday night for 18 years, will move to Friday night. ''Mystery,'' seen on Thursday night for 20 years, will move to Tuesday night. ''Antiques Roadshow,'' PBS's most popular show, will move from Sunday to Monday night and will be repeated on Wednesday. ''Nova,'' which is shown on Tuesday, will be shown again on Thursday night.</p>
        <p>These shows have remained in their original time slots for a simple reason: since PBS does not sell advertising time, it is less reliant on ratings than other networks. So it has had less incentive to change its schedule to raise ratings and charge more for commercial time slots.</p>
        <p>But things have changed for PBS, which must navigate an increasingly difficult landscape with growing competition from cable channels like Discovery, A&amp;E and the History Channel, not to mention the Internet.</p>
        <p>''It's a more crowded marketplace, and it's going to get more crowded,'' explained Pat Mitchell, the new PBS president.</p>
        <p>While PBS's ratings have not fallen off nearly as much as those of the major broadcast networks, executives said they have seen enough slippage to realize that it was time to move some shows to time slots that were perhaps better suited to their viewers' life styles.</p>
        <p>For instance, it was decided that ''Masterpiece Theater'' should move because on Sunday nights it must compete with movies and mini-series, whereas on Monday nights, it is primarily competing against football on ABC, which is not necessarily a favorite of its audience.</p>
        <p>If the experiment works (read: if ratings go up), the scheduling changes will be made for the entire country starting in April 2001, PBS executives said.</p>
