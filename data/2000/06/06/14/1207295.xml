        <p>Despite his longstanding support for the death penalty, Vice President Al Gore suggested yesterday that recent studies showing drastic error rates in court appeals of death penalty cases could prompt a fresh evaluation of the nation's use of capital punishment.</p>
        <p>''If there is a study that shows a large number of mistakes, that has to make you uncomfortable,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I have assumed up until very recently that the mistakes were rare and unusual.''</p>

        <p>Despite his longstanding support for the death penalty, Vice President Al Gore suggested yesterday that recent studies showing drastic error rates in court appeals of death penalty cases could prompt a fresh evaluation of the nation's use of capital punishment.</p>
        <p>''If there is a study that shows a large number of mistakes, that has to make you uncomfortable,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I have assumed up until very recently that the mistakes were rare and unusual.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, speaking with members of the editorial board, a reporter and editors of The New York Times, chose his words carefully and did not suggest that he was ready to abandon his support for the death penalty. And he said he would not impose on federal capital cases the kind of moratorium that Gov. George Ryan has imposed in Illinois.</p>
        <p>Still, he acknowledged that recent events -- including the moratorium in Illinois, a new study from Columbia University that found that two out of three sentences in capital-case appeals were set aside, and the release of some death row inmates who were exonerated through the use of DNA technology -- were prompting a fresh evaluation of the subject, if not by him, then by the country.</p>
        <p>''If further investigation shows that the Columbia estimates are correct,'' he said, ''then that will have a major impact on the way the country feels about not necessarily the death penalty itself but certainly the way in which our judicial system is arriving at these conclusions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's meeting with the editorial board was part of a daylong media blitz of national news organizations. The sessions coincided with the opening of his three-week ''progress and prosperity tour,'' a concerted effort to get credit for the nation's booming economy as well as to kick-start his campaign into a positive yet aggressive mode before the convention.</p>
        <p>The economy was clearly Mr. Gore's message of the day. He even stopped himself short at one point in the interview as he was about to ''commit news,'' as he put it. The first question posed to him concerned his assessment of Mr. Bush as an opponent. In response, he recapped his economic plan in an answer lasting about 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's comments on the death penalty were his most extensive to date on the topic in this presidential campaign. Despite a handful of votes to the contrary while he was in Congress, he has generally supported the death penalty since he was first elected to the House in 1976, and his support for it was viewed as a political plus in 1992 when Bill Clinton chose him as his running mate.</p>
        <p>Still, the death penalty is a topic that Mr. Gore has virtually ignored during this campaign, even as it has swirled around Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his expected Republican rival. Mr. Bush has presided over 131 executions, the most of any governor since the death penalty was reinstated, although he recently issued a stay of execution.</p>
        <p>Aside from the fact that Mr. Gore has never been in the position to sign a death warrant, there appears to be little difference between the two candidates' positions. And Mr. Gore said yesterday that he was not prepared to criticize Mr. Bush over it.</p>
        <p>''I don't know the answer to your question,'' he said when asked if he would make an issue of it. ''If the record shows that he has done a terrible job, then I'm sure that would be a legitimate issue. I haven't reached that conclusion.''</p>
        <p>Diann Rust-Tierney, director of the capital punishment project for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a telephone interview later that Mr. Gore's comments represented ''a higher level of thought and discussion around this issue'' than pro-death-penalty candidates have exhibited in the past. ''It sounds like he is at least thinking about it,'' she said. ''It sounds like there is some sense of progress in his thinking.''</p>
        <p>In an apparent attempt to neutralize questions about earlier votes that some have said indicated a change in his position on the death penalty, Mr. Gore volunteered: ''There have been a number of cases where proposals came before the House of Representatives and the Senate when I voted against capital punishment. But those votes were the exception rather than the rule. I have insisted upon certain criteria before I'm willing to support the death penalty. But where those criteria are present, I have always supported it.''</p>
        <p>In the 75-minute interview, Mr. Gore generally refrained from direct criticism of Mr. Bush, saying at one point, ''I choose not to attach any elegant epithets to my opponent.'' But he also said he believed the Republicans, and by implication Mr. Bush, would advance a right-wing agenda if they won the White House.</p>
        <p>He said that after Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, the evangelists, had met with Mr. Bush, the two were ''happy as clams'' and were not saying anything publicly to contradict the impression that Mr. Bush had agreed to appease them.</p>
        <p>''I infer from that,'' Mr. Gore said, ''that the basic arrangement is that the agenda per noted in the closing days of the Republican primary contest is still very much the real agenda, at least where the Supreme Court appointments are concerned, and that those who are most interested in that agenda have agreed to be completely silent about it during this period of the campaign.''</p>
        <p>The vice president suggested that while he would not apply a litmus test -- usually code to refer to a person's stand on abortion rights -- to his judicial nominees, he would seek those who supported abortion rights. ''I'm not in favor of specific, narrow litmus tests,'' he said. ''But we all know that there are ways to ascertain with high confidence the general approach that potential justices will take to the Constitution.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who said the next president's ability to name three or four Supreme Court justices was one of the top issues in the election, noted in passing that ''Governor Bush has said his favorite justice is Antonin Scalia; mine would be Thurgood Marshall.'' The analogy was perhaps slightly inapt. It was not clear whether Mr. Bush was picking his all-time favorite justice or just those on the bench now, while the late Mr. Marshall is no longer on the bench.</p>
        <p>Throughout the interview, Mr. Gore offered an uncharacteristically modest assessment of his grasp of detail. These assertions seemed an attempt to put the brakes on his tendency to veer toward the tutorial and didactic. ''You're taking me outside my depths,'' he said of a discussion on missile technology. ''I do not claim expertise,'' he said of a discussion of the Microsoft case.</p>
        <p>And, in response to a question from William Safire, the language authority and New York Times columnist, about choice in matters of privacy, Mr. Gore replied: ''Along with roughly 270 million other Americans, I use words more carelessly than Bill Safire, and in choosing the word 'choose,' I did not inform myself of the deeper, more subtle meanings, which I can now see clearly.''</p>
        <p>He went on to say that consumers should have ''absolute protection'' of privacy concerning their medical and financial records. ''I do not think that your bank account and your checking -- the history of what checks you write to whom -- ought to be marketable,'' he said, adding: ''I don't think the current law goes far enough in protecting them.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, he seemed to enjoy showing off his knowledge. At one point, Mr. Gore was asked about his tactical positioning in a question referring to Napoleon's military strategy, and surprised listeners by saying, ''Napoleon also invented canned food.''</p>
        <p>(For the record, Napoleon did not exactly invent canning, but he helped popularize it by offering a reward for anyone who could come up with a way to prevent the spoiling of military food supplies.)</p>
