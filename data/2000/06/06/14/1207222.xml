        <p>What is it about contemporary politics that turns our most vivacious playwrights into zombies? Even silver-tongued dramatists like Christopher Durang (''Sex and Longing'') and Wendy Wasserstein (the Broadway version of ''An American Daughter'') seem to develop a life-draining stammer when their plays approach the subject of those who scurry about Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>Is it because politicians are so widely perceived as existing entirely on the surface, scripted and unsurprising creatures best considered in comic monologues on late-night television? Is it the old quandary of portraying shallowness without being shallow?</p>
        <p>Whatever the reasons, David Marshall Grant hasn't broken the curse with his new comic drama, the deflatingly titled ''Current Events,'' which opened last night at the Manhattan Theater Club. Mr. Grant, who is best known as a stage and television actor (''Angels in America,'' ''Thirtysomething''), made a most auspicious debut as a playwright two seasons ago with ''Snakebit,'' a work that subtly examined the shifting equations of a three-sided friendship.</p>
        <p>''Current Events'' picks up on that formula, with variations. There is, as there was in ''Snakebit,'' an attractive, quirky woman of eroding confidence sliding moorlessly into middle age; a slick charmer of all-consuming ambition and slippery ethics; and between them, an unhappy, morally probing gay male in a general state of confusion.</p>
        <p>These identities have been tinkered with for ''Current Events,'' turning a vaguely romantic triangle into a concretely familial one and substituting the scrambled values of national politics for those of Hollywood. Much is lost in the translation.</p>
        <p>The events of ''Events'' hinge, like those of ''Snakebit,'' on a compromising secret: that 15-year-old Ethan (the winning John Gallagher Jr.) is the son of Adam (Jon Tenney), who is unmarried and running for Congress. Adam's sister, Diana (Christine Ebersole), a former model, adopted Ethan when he was an infant and he now lives tensely in Connecticut with Diana and Adam's mother, Eleanor (Barbara Barrie), an Adlai Stevenson liberal with a sharp tongue and witheringly high standards.</p>
        <p>The confrontations brought about by Ethan's hunger strike to learn the identity of his father do not evolve naturally, and like much socially conscious television, the play feels more driven by situation than by character. The director David Petrarca, who brought such a sure hand to ''Fuddy Meers'' last season, is hard put here to connect the dots of emotional eruptions, confessional monologues and sprightly banter that make up Mr. Grant's script.</p>
        <p>Adam, it should come as no surprise, is a hollow man. Visiting his family with his enigmatic aide-de-camp, Jamie (Jeremy Hollingworth), Mr. Tenney's Adam shows mild tremors of conflict from time to time, but basically he's your standard-issue pasteboard politician who can't see past his own rhetoric.</p>
        <p>Eleanor, even in such expert hands as Ms. Barrie's, correspondingly registers as the usual child-warping mother who comes to realize the error of her ways. Diana is a paler version of the role played by Jodie Markell in ''Snakebit.'' And though Ms. Ebersole and Ms. Barrie both provide some appealing spins on their barbed dialogue, neither is successful in building bridges among her character's abrupt changes in mood and tone.</p>
        <p>The liveliest presence in ''Current Events'' is by far the young Mr. Gallagher, who effortlessly conveys both Ethan's neediness and obnoxiousness. He is also weighed down by a variety of forms of identity crisis and an utterly unconvincing, plot-propelling relationship with his friend Danny (Seth Kirschner).</p>
        <p>Sadly, none of these people are credible in the long run. Whereas in ''Snakebit'' the issues and the one-liners came out of the characters and their relationships, in ''Current Events,'' the reverse is true. Mr. Grant may very well confirm the promise of ''Snakebit'' once he moves on to other territory. Politicians may indeed be actors of a sort, but on a theater stage they tend to be even more boring than they are at the podium.</p>
