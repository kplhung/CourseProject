        <p>Microsoft took an important step today in its effort to overturn the antitrust ruling against it, telling an appellate court that the trial judge had committed ''an array of serious substantive and procedural errors that infected virtually every aspect of the proceedings.''</p>
        <p>It added that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's order last week to break up the company was based largely on ''hearsay declarations submitted by the plaintiffs.''

        <p>Microsoft took an important step today in its effort to overturn the antitrust ruling against it, telling an appellate court that the trial judge had committed ''an array of serious substantive and procedural errors that infected virtually every aspect of the proceedings.''</p>
        <p>It added that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's order last week to break up the company was based largely on ''hearsay declarations submitted by the plaintiffs.'' And it asserted that restrictions imposed by the judge, unless stayed immediately, would have ''far-reaching and irreversible consequences.'' [Excerpts, Page C8.]</p>
        <p>The Microsoft appeals brief came amid a flurry of late-afternoon legal maneuvering. Microsoft filed the document with the Court of Appeals this afternoon, while the Justice Department filed a motion this evening to take the case directly to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Almost as soon as the appeals court received Microsoft's brief, the judges issued a remarkable order saying the entire court, minus three judges who recused themselves, would hear the case ''in view of its exceptional importance.''</p>
        <p>But if the Supreme Court eventually decides to take the direct appeal, the Appeals Court will have to stand down.</p>
        <p>Microsoft opposes a direct appeal to the Supreme Court. A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals, in a related case, issued an important ruling in Microsoft's favor two years ago, and Microsoft wants its appeal to go there. Even if that court did not exonerate Microsoft, it might winnow the case before an ultimate appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>But Judge Jackson has already said he will approve the motion to take the case directly to the Supreme Court, under an obscure law known as the Expediting Act that allows direct appeals of antitrust cases of national importance.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court has not yet received the Justice Department request; it must be certified by Judge Jackson, who will probably do so on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>By issuing its order this afternoon, the Appeals Court judges may be trying to tell the Supreme Court that they will handle the case quickly. Normally an appeal is heard by a three-judge panel, and then by the full court.</p>
        <p>The brief Microsoft filed with the Appeals Court is its request for a stay of the remedy order Judge Jackson imposed last week, calling for a breakup of the company and restrictions on its conduct.</p>
        <p>As part of the stay request, Microsoft was required to demonstrate why the company would be likely to win its appeal of the entire case. To that end Microsoft filed a 39-page brief offering the major points of its appeal strategy, even though court rules limit such documents to 20 pages. (Another Microsoft motion asks for leave from that rule.)</p>
        <p>The brief restates many of the substantive arguments Microsoft has made in the past, but for the first time includes specific criticism of Judge Jackson, both in his trial procedures and in the judgments he made based on the evidence. It accuses Judge Jackson of failing to give Microsoft due process and issuing findings without citing the evidence or legal precedents that justify them.</p>
        <p>In harsh language, the brief complains that the judge's findings ''do not contain a single citation to the record, making it impossible to ascertain'' their ''purported basis.'' It says the court ''erroneously imposed extreme and punitive relief'' that ''bears no relation whatsoever to the antitrust violations found.''</p>
        <p>It notes that the judge ''signed plaintiffs' final judgment as ultimately profferred without a single substantive change.'' And in an elliptical aside, it observes that Microsoft had ''the largest market capitalization in the world'' until ''the court entered its findings of fact.''</p>
        <p>It concludes that if Judge Jackson's remedy was carried out, ''the public will suffer serious and far-reaching harm.''</p>
        <p>''At trial,'' the brief adds, ''the district court largely suspended application of the Federal Rules of Evidence, admitting into evidence numerous newspaper and magazine articles and other rank hearsay.'' (Many newspaper and magazine articles were also offered into evidence by Microsoft.)</p>
        <p>Microsoft attacked Judge Jackson's findings of fact, issued last November -- though under federal court rules, findings of fact are very difficult to appeal.</p>
        <p>''Although 412 paragraphs long, the court's findings do not contain a single citation to the record,'' the brief says, ''making it impossible to ascertain the purported basis for many findings and thereby compounding the many evidentiary errors at trial.'' It adds that many of the findings ''consist of nothing more than sweeping, conclusory assertions.''</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Microsoft prominently mentions the Appeals Court ruling in June 1998, overturning a ruling by Judge Jackson in an earlier, related case. In that opinion, a three-judge Appeals Court panel said Microsoft had the right to integrate new features into Windows as long as the integration offered a plausible consumer benefit.</p>
        <p>A central element of the government's case in the present case was the charge that Microsoft illegally tied its Web browser to Windows. Judge Jackson ruled in favor of the government on that charge, defying the earlier Court of Appeals decision.</p>
        <p>Two of the three judges who were on that 1998 panel -- Raymond Randolph and Stephen F. Williams -- will also hear the appeal of the present case, should the Supreme Court decide not to take it.</p>
        <p>Microsoft also accuses Judge Jackson of procedural error for talking to the news media about the case, at one point singling out The New York Times. ''Most shocking,'' the brief says, ''are the remarks attributed to the court'' in an article in The Times last Friday. Microsoft cited Judge Jackson's statements, given in an interview last February, that he was ''not sure I am competent'' to break up Microsoft.</p>
        <p>A Microsoft lawyer, Tom Burt, said the newspaper stories were cited in large part because ''what the judge said reinforces many of our points.''</p>
        <p>The filings today were the culmination of two days of legal brinksmanship involving Microsoft, the Justice Department and Judge Jackson. This evening none knew what the maneuvering would produce.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department, in its brief filed this evening requesting an expedited appeal, said Microsoft had ''engaged in practices that have seriously impeded competition and have had a substantial anticompetitive impact on innovation in the personal computer industry.''</p>
        <p>The government brief adds that ''in rapidly evolving technology markets, even a brief delay in effectuating remedies that will reduce Microsoft's ability and incentive to engage in anticompetitive conduct will have a serious adverse impact on competition and innovation.''</p>
        <p>In a statement tonight, the Justice Department said Microsoft's filing with the Court of Appeals was ''an ill-conceived attempt to end-run the Expediting Act.'' Judge Jackson did not comment, but direct appeal to the Supreme Court was originally his idea.</p>
        <p>During a chambers conference on April 4, Judge Jackson surprised Microsoft and the government by telling them he wanted to move the appeal of his ruling directly to the Supreme Court, bypassing the Court of Appeals, in part because ''I don't want to disrupt the economy.''</p>
        <p>Then last week, he issued his remedy order to break up the company, and on the same day the Justice Department said it would move to take the appeal directly to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Hours later, Microsoft filed a stay motion with Judge Jackson, asking him to stay the entire remedy order pending appeal. He would be expected to reject the request. But as soon as he did, Microsoft could take the stay request to the Court of Appeals.</p>
        <p>In a brief filed with Judge Jackson on Monday, the Justice Department explained what the department thought Microsoft was trying to do: take the stay request to the Appeals Court to undermine the Justice Department's effort to move the entire case, including the stay request, to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>As a result, the Justice Department asked Judge Jackson not to rule on Microsoft's stay request until the company also filed a notice of appeal of the entire case. Only with that notice of appeal in hand could the government file a motion for expedited appeal.</p>
        <p>This morning, Judge Jackson did file an order saying ''the court reserves ruling on Microsoft's motion'' of a stay pending appeal ''until such time as a timely notice of appeal is filed.''</p>
        <p>Hours later, Microsoft did file the notice of appeal. But without even waiting for Judge Jackson to rule on the stay request, the company filed the expanded stay request with the Court of Appeals.</p>
        <p>''Microsoft's stay motion has been pending for nearly a week, and the district court has 'failed to afford the relief requested' by the motion,'' the company's brief explained.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Burt said: ''It's time to stop the procedural maneuvering. It's time to move to the Court of Appeals.''</p>
        <p>In a statement, the Justice Department said: ''Immediate Supreme Court review of this case is in the public interest because of its importance to the American economy. We are filing today a request that Judge Jackson certify the case for immediate review by the Supreme Court under the Expediting Act. If Judge Jackson grants our request, we will ask the Supreme Court to hear Microsoft's appeal promptly.''</p>
        <p>If the Supreme Court decides to take the case, one justice will also rule on Microsoft's request for a stay of the remedy order Judge Jackson imposed last week. The court can be expected to act on that quickly since a significant part of the remedy order is to take effect in just 84 days.</p>
        <p>The seven judges of the appeals court, should they get the case, would also act quickly on the stay request.</p>
        <p>Four of the seven judges who would hear the case are Republicans, and three are Democrats. Antitrust cases, however, are generally nonpartisan; in fact, Judge Jackson is a Republican, appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1982.</p>
