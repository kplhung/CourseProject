        <p>To her English teacher at McClymonds High, one of the lowest-achieving schools in Oakland, Mara Chavez-Diaz was a beacon -- the food cart owners' daughter who aspired to lift the grade point average of the entire school. Mara is ''the kind of person,'' the teacher, Marsha Rhynes, said, ''who wakes up in the morning and says, 'Aha, I have an idea.' ''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Chavez-Diaz, on the verge of academic stardom, became pregnant, precipitating a downward spiral from which she is still rebounding.</p>
        <p>She was kicked out of the house by the father she adored. Her grades plummeted. She went into labor in January during final exams and later was hospitalized for depression.</p>
        <p>''Shame and fear,'' Ms. Chavez-Diaz said, sitting on a bench outside the school, ''began to replace the confident person I was.''</p>
        <p>But when Ms. Chavez-Diaz, an articulate 19-year-old whose eyeliner highlights soft brown eyes, tells her story at graduation as the school's valedictorian on Wednesday, she will embody one of her father's favorite expressions: ''El que persevera alcaza!'' (''He who persists reaches his goals'').</p>
        <p>Ms. Chavez-Diaz and other graduating seniors in Oakland, Calif., schools are like many young people around the country who have succeeded against huge odds, intriguing sociologists, psychologists and educators with their resilience. They have been able to overcome not just poverty, but the drug addictions of parents, homelessness and other challenging family situations.</p>
        <p>Graduating near the top of the class at Castlemont High School will be Ferrari Miller, who writes plays in his spare time and was drafted last week by the Boston Red Sox professional baseball team. Mr. Miller spent most of his high school years living with friends and relatives, leaving home, he said, to escape the destructive vortex of his mother's cocaine addiction.</p>
        <p>At Fremont High, yet another repository of grim statistics where only 13 percent of the sophomores read at or above the national average, one stellar student dreams of designing airplanes, though he has never flown in one. The Mexican-born son of an illegal immigrant, the student spent his early teenage years living with eight family members in an attic, and now lives with the constant fear of deportation. He may wind up at a community college, rather than the prestigious university to which he was admitted, because his status makes him ineligible for academic scholarships.</p>
        <p>''He has a 4.0, 1,260 on his SAT's,'' a teacher said. ''He's already fought these incredible odds. He's a noble kid.''</p>
        <p>Marching down the aisle to African drumbeats at the McClymonds graduation will be Brittany BarVannah Dunning, the school's ''Student of the Year,'' who spent much of last year bouncing from motel to motel with her mother after they lost their house.</p>
        <p>''I don't need a BMW,'' Ms. Dunning said. ''The things that have gone on recently have shown me I just want to be happy.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rhynes said, ''Both Mara and Brittany have a sense of advocacy, a sense of purpose in life that's greater than whatever it is they're going through.''</p>
        <p>Understanding resilience -- how and why these students, and others like them, succeed against difficult odds -- is of increasing interest to scholars, educators and child development specialists.</p>
        <p>''The kids who make it under a variety of circumstances have key features in common, most notably relationships with competent, confident adults who believe in them,'' said Ann S. Masten, a professor and director of the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota, who has studied resilience among homeless children and children of Cambodian refugees. ''They have good problem-solving skills, figuring out how to gravitate towards healthy environments and positive peers.''</p>
        <p>Many of them, Professor Masten said, ''have an ability to create meaning in life, to hold on to hope, which sometimes manifests itself in faith but sometimes just through optimism.''</p>
        <p>The most striking discovery has been that resilience does not stem from rare or special qualities, she said, but from the ordinary processes that help humans cope and develop, such as the motivation to learn, qualities that can be strengthened by family, community and cultural traditions.</p>
        <p>''You find resilient kids everywhere,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Less understood is how to incorporate those qualities into a school system.</p>
        <p>''At every school, there are kids who are achieving,'' said Jerry Wolfe, the principal of Frick Middle School in East Oakland, Calif. ''The question is, how do you build what we know about resilience into the fabric of a school, so that the kids who succeed are doing it without the asterisk that says, 'in spite of . . .?' ''</p>
        <p>Bonnie Benard, a senior program associate at WestEd, a nonprofit educational research and development organization in San Francisco, said there was a movement among educators to build positive educational paradigms.</p>
        <p>''People are sick of identifying kids by their risks and problems,'' Ms. Benard said. ''We know the majority of kids, not just superkids, can make it no matter where they come from if they encounter caring people who build upon their strengths.''</p>
        <p>But resilience doesn't necessarily translate into success.</p>
        <p>''We seldom look at the psychological price people pay of succeeding against the odds,'' said Edmund W. Gordon, a professor emeritus of psychology at Yale University, who, with Margaret C. Wang, wrote ''Educational Resilience in Inner City America'' (Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1994).</p>
        <p>''It's difficult to go through complex life traumas and not have scars,'' Professor Gordon said. ''They may have high degrees of success in some areas of life but pay for it in others.''</p>
        <p>In studying the lives of black men of high achievement, Professor Gordon found that for some, resilience came with a burden.</p>
        <p>''All the public indices of success were there,'' he said. ''But when you talked about happiness and feelings about their own accomplishments, these were people who were still in a lot of pain.''</p>
        <p>The latest research on resilience runs counter to many stereotypes, said Troy Duster, a sociologist at the University of California at Berkeley and at New York University, and director of the American Culture Center at Berkeley.</p>
        <p>''Americans tend to think of individual achievement, the Clint Eastwood idea of standing alone against all odds,'' Mr. Duster said. ''But if you look closer, what appears to be highly individualized achievement is often really about social support, a complex matrix, whether a family member, teacher or community, that assumes a kid is going to make it and taps them on the shoulder to say, ''Kid, you've got it.''</p>
        <p>For Ferrari Miller, that person was his grandmother, Arnez Postway, a 64-year-old plain-speaking woman, who brooks no nonsense and who says, ''I don't care who he gets drafted by,'' referring to the Red Sox, ''he'd better keep up his education.''</p>
        <p>Along with other family members and friends, Mrs. Postway provided a place to stay and an emotional anchor when Mr. Miller, who never met his father, left home. At one point, Mrs. Postway recalled, her grandson called from a shelter, saying he didn't want to go to school because he didn't have any clothes. ''I said, my mother always taught me, wear whatever you have but make sure that it's clean,'' she recalled. ''I told him, use your own head. Be Ferrari.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller said: ''I've had a lot of people in my family take the wrong path. I've seen what drugs, alcohol and violence did to family members. I said: 'That's not me. That's not my life.'</p>
        <p>''It was difficult to deal with, because I realized I had to do everything by myself,'' he said. ''But it really didn't faze me. That's part of life and part of the things it's going to throw at you.''</p>
        <p>He began writing plays in English class based on ''a life and a world I could see before me,'' including ''Caught Up,'' a work as intense and impatient as Mr. Miller that touches on many deep-seated fears, including peer pressure, the risks of unprotected sex and going to prison. The play was performed earlier this year along with other student works at the Magic Theater in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people didn't expect me to graduate,'' he observed one afternoon, sitting next to the gym at the Boys &amp; Girls Club, which he still visits several times a week. ''I've never been around anyone who wanted to achieve in school. I'm not doing this for anybody else. It's all about me.''</p>
        <p>Achievement was not foreign for Ms. Chavez-Diaz, the valedictorian. Her family, especially her father, had expected it. ''From early on I was responsible at home and school for bringing in awards and good grades,'' she recalled. ''At age 11, because I was good at math, my dad trusted me to handle the cash register at the lunch wagon.''</p>
        <p>She internalized his dreams. ''I'm very strict,'' she said. ''I really pressure myself.''</p>
        <p>When it was time for middle school, she successfully lobbied her parents to send her to a parochial school, rather than a public school, where, she had heard, ''they messed with the girls.'' The family got financial help from the school.</p>
        <p>Unable to afford private high school tuition, she went to McClymonds, a public high school of about 800 students, where well over half the student body, which is predominantly African-American, qualified for a free or reduced-cost lunch. Like other Oakland schools, it has been plagued by low test scores, a high dropout rate and chronic teacher shortages.</p>
        <p>''It was a constant reminder of all the work I had to accomplish,'' Ms. Chavez-Diaz writes in an essay about the school.</p>
        <p>With the encouragement of teachers during the summer of her sophomore year, she attended Upward Bound at Mills College, a federally funded program that provides academic support for high school students from low-income school districts. ''That's when my life changed,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''It answered so many questions,'' Ms. Chavez-Diaz said. ''My parents never went to college. I knew I wanted to go, but I didn't know how I was going to get there.''</p>
        <p>When she became pregnant, the tight weave of her future began unraveling. The people she loved and trusted most, including parents, friends and teachers, urged her to have an abortion.</p>
        <p>Her daughter, Itzel Xiadani, is now 4 months old. Ms. Chavez-Diaz has been living with her husband, Manuel, 24, who works in construction, and his family.</p>
        <p>''He's really smart,'' she said of her husband. ''He's capable of doing so much better.'' Her mother-in-law, Dolores, has been taking care of the baby, and both her husband's parents have been helping her patch things up at home, visiting with her and her parents around the kitchen table.</p>
        <p>Her husband's reaction to her ambitions is a bit problematical. ''He thinks after I'm finished with all my school he's not going to be worth anything to me anymore,'' she said. ''I tell him whatever good I do is going to go back to him and my baby.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday night, Ms. Chavez-Diaz will don a graduation robe of orange, the school color, and address a crowd that will include about 20 members of her family. In her valedictory speech, she will talk about the pregnancy and her relationship with her father, whose trust, she said, she is slowly regaining.</p>
        <p>''Knowing that I have confronted and overcome these obstacles, I realize how powerful I am,'' she will tell them. ''I am no longer content with obtaining my bachelor's degree in psychology. I want my Ph.D.''</p>
