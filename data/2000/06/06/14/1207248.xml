        <p>Hoping to add luster to its looming stock sale,  China Unicom signed an agreement today with Vodafone AirTouch to collaborate on mobile-telephone technology and services in China.</p>
        <p>While short on details, the deal brings together Vodafone, the leading cellular provider, and China Unicom, the No. 2 player, in what could be the world's largest cellular market.</p>
        <p>Initially, China Unicom and Vodafone AirTouch will allow their subscribers to roam in each other's territories. But the agreement could lay the foundation for a larger investment by Vodafone AirTouch in Unicom, which is discussing alliances with several foreign phone companies in advance of China's membership in the World Trade Organization, expected by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Wang Jianzhou, the president of Unicom, said it and Vodafone would negotiate ''areas of cooperation in mobile operations, including wireless data and future joint ventures and partnerships in China, upon China's accession to the W.T.O.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, China Unicom raised the size of its planned share offering to capitalize on the recent popularity of telecommunications stocks. At the high end of the price range, the offering could raise $5.05 billion, which would make it Asia's largest stock sale outside Japan.</p>
        <p>For all the superlatives, China Unicom's debut has been shadowed by a lingering dispute with two partners and a flip-flop in its technology. After signing an agreement with Qualcomm of San Diego last February to upgrade its network with Qualcomm's cellular technology -- code division multiple access -- Unicom shelved the plan last month.</p>
        <p>Unicom said its parent company, China United Telecommunications, would test the next generation of C.D.M.A. technology before licensing it for the publicly listed subsidiary. Until then, Unicom will use a competing technology.</p>
        <p>While Unicom's statement dispelled some of the confusion, it illustrated how the company is hostage to the decisions of its state-owned parent and the Chinese government.</p>
        <p>''We had worked out a framework agreement with Unicom to license technology,'' said Irwin M. Jacobs,  chief of Qualcomm. ''The government was supposed to provide us with a list of approved manufacturers. But shortly after the agreement, there were signs of a slowdown.''</p>
        <p>In a phone interview, Mr. Jacobs said he was confident that Unicom's decision would not hobble the rollout of code division multiple access technology in China. He noted that Beijing had agreed to ambitious targets for use of the technology as part of its negotiations to enter the W.T.O.</p>
        <p>Still, to sweeten his sales pitch, Mr. Jacobs said Qualcomm might be willing to invest in Unicom. ''From what I hear, their I.P.O. is being well subscribed,'' he said. ''But if it were necessary, we would examine it. Our interest is in seeing this happen sooner rather than later.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs said the companies had not talked formally. But he noted that Qualcomm had invested in a South Korean and a Brazilian cellular provider to spread code division multiple access technology. Qualcomm has a lot riding on China; its stock has plunged by more than half since Unicom began to waver on the deal.</p>
        <p>Despite the confusion it has caused among investors, few analysts fault China Unicom for not proceeding with Qualcomm's technology. ''For commercial reasons, it doesn't make sense for Unicom to invest in C.D.M.A.,'' said Hani Abuali, a telecommunications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in Hong Kong. ''They would just be overbuilding their existing network.''</p>
        <p>Qualcomm is not the only partner to feel bruised by Unicom. The company is locked in a dispute with two foreign investors, who say Unicom breached contracts with them at the behest of the Chinese government.</p>
        <p>The two companies, Singapore Technologies and Lark International of Hong Kong, set up paging joint ventures with Unicom in the mid-1990's. To circumvent Chinese laws forbidding foreign ownership of telecommunications networks, they created joint ventures that leased operating sites to China Unicom. Then, in 1998, Beijing called these arrangements illegal and ordered them to be broken up.</p>
        <p>Unicom unraveled more than 40 partnerships with companies like Sprint, Bell Canada, and France Telecom. It returned $1.2 billion in investments, plus $487 million in compensation. Unicom also granted the companies warrants to buy shares in the share offering.</p>
        <p>But none of this satisfied Singapore Technologies or Lark. They say Unicom has refused to compensate them for the fair-market value of their joint ventures, and they are preparing lawsuits.</p>
        <p>''They are not complying with these agreements, with the seeming cooperation of the government,'' said Donald Meyer, a Lark director.</p>
        <p>Analysts say the disputes do not pose much of a threat to the stock offering, since the paging partnerships lie outside the publicly listed company. But they symbolize the arbitrary nature of contracts in China, just as China Unicom prepares to begin trading in New York and Hong Kong next week.</p>
