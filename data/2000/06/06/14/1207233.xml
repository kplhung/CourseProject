        <p>The New York City Ballet danced its way through several choreographic worlds on Friday night at the New York State Theater.</p>
        <p>The Donizetti music George Balanchine chose for his ''Donizetti Variations'' evokes Italy at its sunniest. Balanchine's bouncy steps also recall those of August Bournonville, the great 19th-century Danish choreographer known for his sequences of quick and light movements. And one of Bournonville's masterpieces is a ballet called ''Napoli.''</p>
        <p>Whatever Balanchine's actual inspiration may have been, ''Donizetti Variations'' is a charmer. It received a blithe performance led by Jenifer Ringer, who was making her debut in the role, and Damian Woetzel. Ms. Ringer was buoyant as she let each phrase build without strain into the next.</p>
        <p>Richard Tanner took Maria Kowroski and Jock Soto into an icy choreographic realm in his ''Sonatas and Interludes.'' The dancers performed its steps with an almost surgical precision. Their sharpness was impressive. But this is a peculiar pas de deux.</p>
        <p>It is accompanied by some of John Cage's compositions for a piano with objects placed on its strings to alter the timbre. Cage called this instrument a prepared piano and the sounds he prepared in these particular pieces, which were played by Elaine Chelton, sometimes sounded like a Balinese gamelan and at other times like a tipsy harpsichord. Cage proved he could be musically whimsical. Mr. Tanner remains always choreographically aloof. The dancers were brilliantly chilly.</p>
        <p>It was unfortunate that ''Sonatas and Interludes'' was immediately followed by a repeat performance of Merce Cunningham's ''Summerspace.''</p>
        <p>Because both dances have scores made up of sonic fragments, some theatergoers might find two such works in a row monotonous. In contrast to Mr. Tanner's deliberate rigidity to Cage, Mr. Cunningham puts his dancers at ease to Morton Feldman's music.</p>
        <p>The evening concluded with ''I'm Old-Fashioned,'' Jerome Robbins's tribute to Jerome Kern, fancy ballrooms and Hollywood musicals. Rachel Rutherford made her debut as one of the soloists, looking like an elegant young woman who would grace any ballroom.</p>
        <p>The evening's conductors were Hugo Fiorato and John Kennedy.</p>
