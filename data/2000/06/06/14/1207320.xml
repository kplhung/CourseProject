        <p>In the most pointed criticism yet of her opponent in the New York Senate race, Hillary Rodham Clinton attacked Representative Rick A. Lazio today for not supporting a federal bill that would allow patients to sue health maintenance organizations and accused him of waffling on other issues.</p>
        <p>''I think you'll find when you look at my opponent's record, he has a pattern of changing positions, trying to figure out which way the political winds are blowing,'' Mrs. Clinton told reporters this morning at Northern Westchester Hospital Center, where she championed a so-called patients' bill of rights now before Congress.</p>
        <p>''You're going to have a great time trying to figure out where he stands on issues,'' she continued, ''because if you look at his record it sort of depends on who the last person he talked to was.''</p>
        <p>The criticism showed a new-found aggressiveness for Mrs. Clinton, who, until now, has relied on her campaign staff when gloves had to be taken off. Her comments accusing Mr. Lazio of indecision on issues including hate crimes and campaign finance came as polls showed her in a statistical dead heat with Mr. Lazio, despite the fact that the four-term congressman is still an unknown quantity to many voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign defended his voting record and threw the waffling charge back at Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''In everything from socialized medicine to support of a Palestinian state, if flip-flopping and waffling were Olympic events, she would get a 10, even from the East German judge,'' said Dan McLagan, spokesman for the Lazio campaign. ''It's surprising that they are already so desperate as to be using such false smears.''</p>
        <p>Against a backdrop of doctors and nurses, Mrs. Clinton pushed for managed care legislation that would set national standards for health insurance and give patients the right to sue their health maintenance organizations. Such a bill was narrowly defeated last week in the Senate.</p>
        <p>Last fall, Mr. Lazio voted against an identical bill in the House of Representatives, while supporting a Republican version placing limits on liability.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said a patient's right to sue had taken on new urgency since the Supreme Court ruled Monday that the financial incentives offered to doctors by health maintenance organizations to control costs do not make the H.M.O.'s liable to suit in federal court.</p>
        <p>After her public comments at the hospital's new neuroscience center, Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Lazio's position to reporters.</p>
        <p>''If my opponent wants to stand on the sidelines and say that H.M.O.'s should not be held accountable, that's his choice, but that's not where I am and that's not where the majority of New Yorkers are,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. McLagan defended Mr. Lazio's position, saying, ''He has consistently supported the Republican version, which is a patients' bill of rights rather than a lawyer's right to bill.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also went after Mr. Lazio for what she called his waffling on campaign finance reform, specifically on legislation that would require tax-exempt political organizations to disclose their donor lists. ''He first voted for it, then the Republican leadership must have gotten hold of him and then he voted against it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was referring to a vote in Congress last month in which Mr. Lazio changed his vote in midstream, first for and then against disclosure. Mr. Lazio's campaign staff says that he has supported full disclosure in the past, but that the provision was tacked on to a bill repealing an antiquated telephone tax. Voting for disclosure, a spokesman said, would have sent the repeal measure back to committee.</p>
        <p>As for the sudden switch in the midst of the voting, Mr. McLagan called it a technical error. ''Either the record is wrong or he pushed the wrong button,'' he said. ''He was always in favor of the tax cut and would have no reason to derail it.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also chastised the Long Island congressman, who replaced Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in the Senate race on May 20, for shifting positions on hate crimes legislation. ''My opponent was told by somebody, a pollster, that he ought to jump on hate crimes legislation coming out of Albany,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday in Washington, Mr. Lazio said he preferred tougher sentences for bias crimes rather than the creation of a new category of crime -- on the same day the Republican-controlled State Senate passed a hate crimes bill. On Monday, Mr. Lazio met with Senate Republicans in Albany, declaring his support for the hate crimes bill.</p>
