        <p>Perhaps more than audiences or even applause, the most sought-after resource for much of the city's artistic community is something very practical: space.</p>
        <p>Thus, the opening next week of the New 42nd Street Studios, at 231 West 42nd Street, is being greeted with the excitement usually reserved for a rave review or a Tony Award.</p>
        <p>Rising 10 stories in a shimmer of acid-etched glass and Art Deco lettering, the building contains five floors of rehearsal studios complete with sprung floors, floor-to-ceiling mirrors, natural lighting and 13- to 15-foot ceilings.</p>
        <p>Between the rehearsal floors are dressing rooms, showers, lockers and other basic amenities. Those floors will also house administrative offices for nonprofit companies large and small, ranging from the Williamstown Theater Festival to the New Professional Theater, a company devoted to the work of African-American artists.</p>
        <p>The building also houses the Duke On 42nd Street, a 199-seat black-box theater on the second floor, which will be home to a variety of experimental and lower-budget productions.</p>
        <p>Financing for the building came from public and private sources. An initial $14.1 million raised by the nonprofit New 42nd Street includes money from the developers of the four office buildings at each corner of 42nd Street and Times Square, as mandated by an agreement with the 42nd Street Development Project. The remaining $15.5 million was to be raised as part of a capital campaign; $12.2 million of that amount has been committed, including grants from the city and state. The capital campaign's largest gift came from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which gave $3.5 million and whose name adorns the second-floor theater.</p>
        <p>''It's the first building built specifically for a range of art forms, and for both nonprofit and commercial uses,'' said Cora Cahan, president of the New 42nd Street Inc., the nonprofit organization that oversaw the planning and construction of the $29.6 million building.</p>
        <p>Some of the early bookings for the studios bear out that intention. In early August, for example, there will be workshop presentations of a big-budget commercial musical, ''Sweet Smell of Success,'' with John Lithgow in the leading role of J. J. Hunsecker, a ruthless columnist. A month later, the New Professional Company is to present the inaugural production in the Duke.</p>
        <p>The studios, designed by Platt Byard Dovell, are scheduled to open Wednesday, with a dedication ceremony expected to be attended by Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>There building also has something for fund-raisers: the third floor features a spacious pine-floor rehearsal room that can double as a space for public functions.</p>
        <p>''It would allow a company to have a presentation downstairs and then a dinner here, without ever leaving the building,'' Ms. Cahan said.</p>
        <p>The studios are open for rental to any production, and Ms. Cahan said there had already been a flood of requests. The organization also has a grant pending that would allow companies with small yearly budgets -- $1.5 million or less -- to rent rehearsal space for as little $10 an hour. Ms. Cahan said the building was expected to be self-sufficient, with all the companies, including New 42nd Street itself, paying rent.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cahan, who helped establish the venerable rehearsal studios at 890 Broadway, now home to American Ballet Theater and other companies, said she found something satisfying in the New 42d Street Studios being situated on a street jammed with restaurants and popcorn-loving moviegoers.</p>
        <p>''Everything else on this street is about consumption,'' Ms. Cahan said. ''This is about process.''</p>
