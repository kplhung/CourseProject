      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Rhythm was the core of Chick Corea's Town Hall show on Sunday night, to an overpowering, almost surprising degree. It's interesting to see a mainstream jazz group yield so much to the power of the rhythm section: for stretches in almost every piece, the three-part horn section -- when its players weren't playing their harmonized arrangements or their solos -- simply stood at the back of the stage and played percussion instruments, adding fuel to the sparks created by the bassist Avishai Cohen and the drummer Jeff Ballard. And sometimes even Mr. Corea, one of the great piano soloists in jazz, did that, too.</p>
        <p>His latest band, Origin, is filled with some of the best younger musicians in New York who haven't yet become stars. Its recordings -- a six-disc set of live shows from 1998 and a recent single CD called ''Change'' -- have appeared on Mr. Corea's own label, Stretch (an imprint of Concord). Mr. Corea has also been using the label to put out individual records by members of the band.</p>

        <p>Rhythm was the core of Chick Corea's Town Hall show on Sunday night, to an overpowering, almost surprising degree. It's interesting to see a mainstream jazz group yield so much to the power of the rhythm section: for stretches in almost every piece, the three-part horn section -- when its players weren't playing their harmonized arrangements or their solos -- simply stood at the back of the stage and played percussion instruments, adding fuel to the sparks created by the bassist Avishai Cohen and the drummer Jeff Ballard. And sometimes even Mr. Corea, one of the great piano soloists in jazz, did that, too.</p>
        <p>His latest band, Origin, is filled with some of the best younger musicians in New York who haven't yet become stars. Its recordings -- a six-disc set of live shows from 1998 and a recent single CD called ''Change'' -- have appeared on Mr. Corea's own label, Stretch (an imprint of Concord). Mr. Corea has also been using the label to put out individual records by members of the band.</p>
        <p>He's getting a lot done, and in only two years of recording and touring, Origin has become impressive, easily one of jazz's best working bands. Afro-Cuban music is deeply imprinted on it, and between the detailed arrangements of the music and the authoritative power of its rhythm section, Sunday night's concert, part of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, struck a neat compromise. Half of it intimated the driving power of a Latin dance orchestra; the other half presented the experience of a jazz group whose individual soloists have something to say through harmony and motivic development.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corea is generous with Origin. Most evident were his touch, the classical sound of his chords and the accuracy of his time; he played marimba on his recent piece, ''Wigwam,'' and his theme became part of the rhythmic weave. Though he played hard, he took no grandstanding solos; he left bravura up to his players. Steve Davis's methodical, cool-headed trombone playing was broken up with space; saxophone solos by Steve Wilson and Tim Garland hung fast through the storm of rhythm behind them, becoming white-knuckle crowd rousers.</p>
        <p>But the virtuosity of the group's bassist and drummer anchored the set. Mr. Cohen's bass sound is deep and thick, but he's an almost hyperarticulate player: sometimes he created drones and slapped the side of his instrument to complement a drum pattern. But he also ran fast, guitarlike lines up the neck, in which each note had a pulse and definition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ballard, the only member of the group who took no pauses, steered the band through Cuban and jazz rhythms. In Mr. Corea's more balladic piece ''Hand Me Down,'' Mr. Ballard played hand-drums, but that turned out to be the set's only reflective moment. The rest was relentlessly physical, driving music. Sections of an improvisation between Mr. Corea and the rhythm section in the suite ''Lylah Awakening'' could have been lifted and sampled for a drum-and-bass dance-floor record. Rarely does jazz have such a volcanic bounce.</p>
        <p>The Microscopic Septet, opening the show with a 20-year reunion concert, recreated the feel of an Atlantis-like city, early-80's New York, a sort of screwball town where sassy irony ruled and musicians in skinny neckties played their brainy tunes in tiny speak-easies that defied zoning laws.</p>
        <p>The group played a handful of its best tunes, ''The Lobster Parade,'' ''Chinese Twilight Zone'' and ''Take the Z Train'' among them. It sifted various popular rhythms of 20th-century America, from habanera to swing to rock 'n' roll, and the more abrupt the transitions between them, the better.</p>
        <p>The pieces, most of them written by the saxophonist Phillip Johnston and the pianist Joel Forrester, were a bit like early Ellington in their frequent jumps between melodic and rhythmic strains; that is, if Ellington did slapstick. Each instrument was used for comic potential, culminating in Dave Sewelson's baritone-saxophone roars and deflating-balloon imitations. It was a salty reminder of a lost age.</p>
