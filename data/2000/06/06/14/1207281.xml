        <p>After a brief meeting with Syria's designated new leader, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright declared today that she found him ready to pursue the peace talks that the Clinton administration has tried to broker between Israel and Syria.</p>
        <p>The lanky figure of the new leader, Bashar al-Assad, the 34-year-old son of Hafez al-Assad, towered over the secretary. Dr. Albright described him as ''very poised'' and ''somebody who is ready to assume his duties.''</p>
        <p>The secretary and the senior administration officials who accompanied her hope that Dr. Assad will be a modernizing reformer.</p>
        <p>Several days before the death of President Assad, Dr. Albright met with the foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, to explore reviving the Syrian-Israeli peace talks. She said she and Dr. Assad agreed today to ''continue discussions about the peace process.''</p>
        <p>That, she said, will be done at an ''appropriate time,'' presumably sometime after the official 40-day period of mourning.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright spent about 15 minutes with Dr. Assad in a side room of the People's Palace after standing momentarily before the coffin of the late president and then moving down a vast hall with her delegation to greet the heir apparent.</p>
        <p>The encounter was the first by a senior member of the Clinton administration with Dr. Assad. Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, who was in the group with Dr. Albright, said the new leader had been emphatic in his interest in the peace efforts. He quoted Dr. Assad as volunteering, ''I'm going to carry on peace just like my father did.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Specter, who met with President Assad about a dozen times, said he and Dr. Albright interpreted the remark not as a reflection of the intransigent attitude of the father, who was an obstacle to American policy, but rather the more flexible approach of the younger man.</p>
        <p>But there were many uncertainties about how the son would cope with the labyrinth of Syrian politics concocted by his father.</p>
        <p>Implicit in the comments by Dr. Albright and her aides is the recognition that there is a big difference between Dr. Assad's assuming power -- in a process choreographed by his father -- and his holding power over the long term.</p>
        <p>A novice at politics, Dr. Assad has been promoted from colonel to lieutenant general and made commander of the armed forces. His party quickly nominated him for president. Parliament is to set a date for a national vote that he seems assured of winning.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Assad must rely on the backing of the military leaders, among whom he has little real standing. Unlike his father, who was a fighter pilot and a defense minister, Dr. Assad has scant military experience.</p>
        <p>Military figures as well as some in the Baath Party were seated today on one side of the hall where Dr. Assad received visitors. In the last two years, President Assad purged old-timers from the military and the party who were likely to pose a threat to his son.</p>
        <p>The new echelon of leaders is assumed to be more loyal, but some of them are related to those who have been deposed. The old guard and the new guard will wait, watching for missteps by the new man, experts said.</p>
        <p>''Bashar will survive only if he shows determination, leadership capabilities, charisma and, finally, the necessary degree of brutality toward his enemies at home,'' said Eyal Zisser, a professor at Tel Aviv University's department of Middle Eastern history. ''Does Bashar have the killer instinct? Only time will tell, but Bashar's ability to hold on to power depends on it.''</p>
        <p>Diplomats say that Dr. Assad must rely on his brother-in-law, Asef Shoukat, who is married to Dr. Assad's strong-willed sister, Bushra, to keep a lid on dissent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shoukat, the director of military intelligence, was among a group of army generals who went to pledge allegiance to Dr. Assad over the weekend. So far, said a Western diplomat familiar with Syrian politics, he is loyal to Dr. Assad.</p>
        <p>From abroad, the exiled younger brother of the late president, Rifaat al-Assad, has issued a challenge to the designated new leader, saying he had no constitutional right to become president. Today, little stock was put in the threat, and when asked about it, Syrians said Dr. Assad would be arrested if he tried to enter the country.</p>
        <p>In an explanation of why the United States expects the new leader to pursue peace with Israel, a senior administration official said the failed talks in Geneva in March between President Clinton and President Assad ''were not the end of the story.'' The Syrian leader had ''not closed the door'' totally, the official said.</p>
        <p>The official, who briefed reporters on Dr. Albright's plane, said Dr. Assad had made clear that he did ''not want the process to be over.''</p>
        <p>''He could have done that, and he didn't,'' the official said. ''The nature of the gaps are not that wide.''</p>
        <p>But there is doubt that the son would be willing to let Israel keep a sliver of land on the shore of the Sea of Galilee that Syria held before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. President Assad refused to budge on that.</p>
        <p>''I would not expect him to yield on his father's principle,'' said Christopher Ross, a former American ambassador to Syria. ''That's because the land is the land, and because it is a popular position with the Syrians, and it was his father's legacy.''</p>
