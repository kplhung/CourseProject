        <p>Taking a page from baseball's early history, the Mets and the Yankees will play each other in each other's park on the same day next month. Their day-night doubleheader for July 8 gained approval yesterday from Major League Baseball and the Players Association.</p>
        <p>The teams will play their regularly scheduled game at Shea Stadium in the afternoon that Saturday, then move to Yankee Stadium to make up the game that was rained out last Sunday night. The day game is scheduled to start at 1:15, the night game at 8:05. The Yankees said yesterday that tickets for the rained-out game will be honored that night.</p>

        <p>Taking a page from baseball's early history, the Mets and the Yankees will play each other in each other's park on the same day next month. Their day-night doubleheader for July 8 gained approval yesterday from Major League Baseball and the Players Association.</p>
        <p>The teams will play their regularly scheduled game at Shea Stadium in the afternoon that Saturday, then move to Yankee Stadium to make up the game that was rained out last Sunday night. The day game is scheduled to start at 1:15, the night game at 8:05. The Yankees said yesterday that tickets for the rained-out game will be honored that night.</p>
        <p>The doubleheader will mark the first time since 1903 that the same teams will play two games in different parks on the same day.</p>
        <p>Research by Elias Sports Bureau found that in a scheduled pair of games on Labor Day that season, the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Superbas (later Dodgers) played at Washington Park in Brooklyn in the morning and at the Polo Grounds in the afternoon. The Giants won in Brooklyn before 2,300 fans, and the Superbas won in Manhattan before 23,623.</p>
        <p>That was not the first such doubleheader. On Oct. 21, 1877, Hall of Fame research determined, the Detroit Wolverines of the National League and the St. Louis Browns of the American Association played a morning game in Washington and an afternoon game in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>The games were the 10th and 11th of a 15-game so-called World Series that was played in 10 different cities between the champions of the two leagues. The teams completed the Washington game in 2 hours 10 minutes, then took the train to Baltimore, where Detroit clinched the series with a 13-3 victory in two hours.</p>
        <p>That unusual doubleheader was also apparently created by rain. The game in Washington was rained out the previous day.</p>
        <p>Details for the New York doubleheader remain to be worked out, but the Mets and the Yankees will more likely ride buses from Queens to the Bronx than travel by train, that is, subway.</p>
        <p>But will they take showers between games? Will the Yankees wear their street clothes to Shea Stadium, change into their road uniforms there, change back to their street clothes, then put on their pinstripe home uniforms at Yankee Stadium? Or will they wear their road uniforms to Shea, and then simply change into their home uniforms when they return to their park? Will the Mets change uniforms at Shea and ride dressed for Game 3 to the Bronx, or will they change from home uniforms to street clothes, then to road uniforms after they arrive at Yankee Stadium?</p>
        <p>Will some players become confused by the different uniforms and put on the wrong one at the wrong place? Will they remember who bats in the top half of the inning and who in the bottom half? Will the potential confusion affect their play and the outcome of the games?</p>
        <p>The Mets-Yankees series, on the last weekend before the All-Star Game break, will undergo one other change. The Sunday game at Shea is being switched from day to night, not for weather but for television.</p>
