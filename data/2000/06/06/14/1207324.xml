        <p>Gasoline is so expensive in the Midwest that a retired railroad worker in Cleveland says he had to cancel his annual summer drive to visit his daughter in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>A volunteer agency that delivers meals to shut-ins in Milwaukee cannot afford to pay its drivers enough to fill their tanks.</p>
        <p>A florist in Urbana, Ill., is talking about raising what he charges to deliver his roses and carnations.</p>
        <p>And in suburban Chicago, Kathy Stachnik says she now considers putting gas in her blue 1997 Honda Accord an ''evil necessity.''</p>
        <p>''Whenever I stand at the pumps these days, I'm just furious,'' said Ms. Stachnik, 38, as she bought 10 gallons of gas at an Amoco in Arlington Heights for $2.25 a gallon. ''I know that something fishy is going on with these prices.''</p>
        <p>Gasoline prices in the Midwest have risen sharply in recent weeks, jumping as much as 50 cents a gallon and far outstripping increases in the rest of the country. In Chicago and Milwaukee, drivers are paying more than $2 a gallon, the first time prices have ever soared that high in the United States, analysts say.</p>
        <p>In recent days, the federal government has been trying to determine why the prices in the Midwest have risen so steeply. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department met with oil refiners on Monday in Washington. And the Clinton administration and the House Judiciary Committee have asked the Federal Trade Commission to look into whether the increases involve price gouging or collusion.</p>
        <p>''We don't have good explanations,'' said Robert Perciasepe, the environmental agency's assistant administrator for air and pollution programs. ''We're not seeing this anywhere else in the country.''</p>
        <p>Gas prices increased across the country in the last few weeks as the summer driving season began. Gasoline inventories are being depleted, and new requirements for cleaner-burning gasoline became effective on June 1. But the spikes in the Midwest are especially steep.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the most recent day for which figures are available, the average price of self-serve regular gasoline in Chicago was $2.13 a gallon, up from $1.37 a gallon in January, according to Trilby Lundberg, an analyst who compiles the Lundberg Survey of gas station prices. By comparison, prices on Long Island averaged $1.67 a gallon last week, up from $1.39 in January. And prices in Los Angeles averaged $1.56 a gallon in June, up from $1.29 in January.</p>
        <p>Industry representatives say the price increases in the Midwest are a result of several factors.</p>
        <p>The most significant, they say, is the new federal requirement for cleaner-burning gasoline, known as RFG-2. In the Midwest, unlike in other regions, the additive oil refiners use to make their gasoline comply with the regulations is ethanol. Because ethanol evaporates quickly, it requires a special formulation of gasoline, said Edward H. Murphy, general manager for downstream operations at the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group.</p>
        <p>''It's more difficult to produce that gasoline,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''As a result, production is significantly lower.''</p>
        <p>Another factor, industry officials say, was the rupture in March of a Texas pipeline that Midwest refineries depended on for their supply. The pipeline was repaired two weeks later, but it is still operating at only 80 percent capacity.</p>
        <p>A third factor is a court ruling that the Unocal Corporation can collect royalties on a particular type of cleaner-burning fuel. That has prompted smaller refineries to curtail RFG-2 production to avoid paying royalties to Unocal, industry analysts say.</p>
        <p>''In a situation where supplies are tight, and you have relatively inelastic demand for gasoline, the price increase you need that occurs in the market is disproportionately large,'' said Mr. Murphy, who said some refineries are carting in the fuel they need by barge from Nova Scotia or the Gulf states. ''If the price of lemons goes up, you move to limes. If the price of coffee goes up, you move to tea. But with gasoline, consumers don't adjust very quickly in a very short term. Obviously you don't go out and trade in your brand new Ford Excursion for a Toyota Camry.''</p>
        <p>Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department acknowledge that all these factors play a role in increasing gas prices somewhat. But they say none is sufficient to account for the precipitous price jumps in cities like Chicago and Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>''All of these may have some impact but they don't seem to explain the size of the disparity,'' Mr. Perciasepe said. For example, he said the cost of producing cleaner gasoline with ethanol should lead to only about a 5 cent to 8 cent increase in gas prices. ''Whether people are taking advantage of some of these situations is something that we hope to be able to understand better.''</p>
        <p>A senior official at the Energy Department said that although the supply of oil was tight in the Midwest, ''we weren't persuaded by the arguments of the refiners. Generally speaking, all of the large suppliers say they have adequate supplies to serve the demand.''</p>
        <p>The official added, ''It has the administration very concerned, obviously.''</p>
        <p>Sam Stratman, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee and its chairman, Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, said that oil companies had years to prepare for the increased costs of the RFG-2 regulations.</p>
        <p>''This is a complicated issue,'' Mr. Stratman said. ''It deals with issues of supply and demand and regulatory changes mandated by E.P.A., and you wonder, have these changes given oil companies a chance to gouge consumers?''</p>
        <p>Of course, Americans still have the lowest gas prices in the world. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which controls nearly half of the global oil supply, will meet next week to decide on whether to increase production.</p>
        <p>Although the prices in Chicago and Milwaukee are the highest on record, they are still lower than gas prices were at their peak in March 1981, when the national average price of a gallon of gasoline was $2.67, if adjusted for inflation, Ms. Lundberg said.</p>
        <p>That is hardly comforting to beleaguered drivers across the Midwest these days.</p>
        <p>''It's outrageous,'' said Colleen Posinger, 44, of Streamwood, Ill. ''I'm really upset about the gas prices, because we told our 10-year-old daughter that we'd drive to South Dakota this summer. The vacation was already planned, so I guess we'll just have to take the crunch.''</p>
        <p>Others, like Adam Matavovszky, the retired railroad worker in Cleveland, decided they could not afford their vacations.</p>
        <p>In Milwaukee, Goodwill Industries, which delivers meals to the elderly and also takes disabled people to workshops and training programs, has been hit by $23,000 in extra fuel costs this year, said Roger Sherman, vice president for human services. He said the organization had asked for emergency assistance from the Milwaukee County Department of Aging and might have to cut back on transportation.</p>
        <p>''We are running 150 percent over budget,'' Mr. Sherman said. ''We have not kept up with the rising gasoline prices.''</p>
