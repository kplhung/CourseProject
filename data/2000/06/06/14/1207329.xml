        <p>HERE is a very sound reason the Yankees may not get Sammy Sosa:</p>
        <p>The baseball wisdom of George Steinbrenner.</p>
        <p>Stop laughing.</p>
        <p>Sosa is not a good fit for the Yankees, and Steinbrenner is going to see the light before he does anything foolish, like breaking his salary structure and team chemistry to import a slugger when the Yankees really need pitching.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner has won three World Series in the last four years -- and, yes, he helped win them -- by ignoring the hair-trigger impulses of his bad old days. He has learned to listen to logic. And logic says Sammy Sosa is quite likely to unsettle what the Yankees have been building.</p>
        <p>The Sosa rumors would not quit last night, after Steinbrenner had a rare meeting with Joe Torre, and before the Yankees lost their game against the Red Sox, 5-3, at a damp Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Did Sosa come up during the meeting with Steinbrenner?</p>
        <p>''The name was mentioned,'' Torre said with a smile.</p>
        <p>Torre admitted that players asked him about rumors ''from time to time'' and conceded that the Yankees ''are talking, but it's not close.''</p>
        <p>The manager could not say much about Sosa, other than express admiration, ''because that would be tampering.'' And he insisted that an imported star -- no names mentioned -- would not be a distraction.</p>
        <p>However, the best players in the Yankee clubhouse, with their biggest contracts still ahead of them, including Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera and Jorge Posada, just might see Sosa in terms of millions of dollars not available to them.</p>
        <p>In the savage gouge of new-age baseball ticket prices, even the Yankees can only go so far.</p>
        <p>The players are not indulging in such ethical deliberations, but surely have reason to feel threatened. And if they don't make the financial connection, they all have agents who will.</p>
        <p>This is not a diatribe against Sosa, by the way. Sosa is a decent gent who plays with zest and grace, and was more fun than Mark McGwire during the home run derby of 1998. Also, he can hit. The only reason he is suddenly available is that he was not happy when his manager, Don Baylor, suggested Sosa is not a wonderful right fielder.</p>
        <p>Cub fans have learned to put up with the sight of balls getting lost in the ivy or bouncing around in the corner. Sosa wears No. 21, a lovely gesture, but he does not play right field the way the great Roberto Clemente did. Cubbie fans sip another coldie and wait for the bottom of the inning to see if Sammy can hoist one toward Waveland Avenue. That's all Cub fans want, or expect.</p>
        <p>But this all changed when Baylor, who came up with the old Baltimore Orioles and has never lost his passion for the total game, spoke the truth.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Sosa was on the market, inducing a typical only-in-New-York back-page feeding frenzy. This, too, is understandable since Sosa would light up the night for a mediocre ball club in New York -- except that there are none.</p>
        <p>The Mets are charmingly trying to get into the playoffs again this year with a nice bunch of players. They shouldn't go after Sosa because that would jeopardize the pot of gold they are saving for Alex Rodriguez next season.</p>
        <p>Besides, the Mets are in the wrong league for Sosa. In the curious bipolar setup in which one league uses the designated hitter and one league plays baseball, Sosa would be a great boost for an American League team that needs one great player to blast deep into the playoffs.</p>
        <p>The Yankees should not think of getting Sosa merely to keep him from one of their potential opponents in October. They can win it all with the regulars they've got, but only if their dubious pitching holds up.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner has done a fine job from the moment he signed Torre after the 1995 season. (He had his own moments of doubt when he read the wacko back page headlines the next day, but that's another story.) Steinbrenner has not imported many disruptions recently. The club got a World Series out of Cecil Fielder. It got mileage out of a fading Doc Gooden. (The latest Gooden signing is harmless good will by Steinbrenner.) And for all the energy that Darryl Strawberry demanded, he was worth it because he became a role player who terrified opposing managers just by sitting on the bench.</p>
        <p>No fault of his, but Sosa needs more money and space and attention than the Yankees ought to give him. Steinbrenner will figure it out. That's how George earned his last three World Series rings. Don't laugh.</p>
