        <p>A second police officer acquitted in the Amadou Diallo shooting has applied to become a New York City firefighter, his lawyer said last night.</p>
        <p>Officer Edward McMellon took the written test ''a while ago,'' said his attorney, Stephen Worth. He said he did not know exactly when the officer took the test or how well he scored.</p>
        <p>News that Officer McMellon had applied was first reported today in The New York Post.</p>
        <p>More than a year ago, another officer in the Diallo shooting, Richard Murphy, took and passed the test and was on the list of potential candidates.</p>
        <p>The officers are not eligible to be transferred to the Fire Department until Police Departmental charges pending against them are settled, officials said.</p>
        <p>The departmental charges, in turn, cannot be dealt with until the United States Department of Justice decides whether to charge them with violating Mr. Diallo's civil rights in the February 1999 shooting. Officers McMellon and Murphy and two other officers, Sean Carroll and Kenneth Boss, fired 41 bullets at the unarmed Mr. Diallo in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building after one of them mistook Mr. Diallo's wallet for a gun, they testified.</p>
        <p>On February 25 of this year, all four officers were acquitted of murder charges in the shooting.</p>
        <p>The four officers are working desk jobs pending the results of the federal and departmental inquiries.</p>
        <p>The Fire Department is allowed to consider applicants' backgrounds in deciding whether to hire them. Officer McMellon, a six-year veteran of the force, has had five complaints lodged against him with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, but none were substantiated.</p>
        <p>Officer McMellon tripped and fell just as the shooting began on Feb. 4, 1999, leading his colleagues to believe he had been shot and prompting them to open fire, their lawyers have maintained. He fired 16 rounds at Mr. Diallo, a 21-year-old immigrant from Guinea. Officer Murphy fired four rounds.</p>
