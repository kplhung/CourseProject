        <p>A Shell Is a Shell, No Matter Its Age</p>
        <p>There was a brouhaha in the vault at the New-York Historical Society before VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE'S speech upstairs in the auditorium yesterday. Society officials said the trouble started when Secret Service brought in a German shepherd to sniff its way through their formal Beaux-Arts building at Central Park West and 77th Street.</p>
        <p>''We have a vault in the basement where we keep our silver and other such things,'' said STUART DESMOND, a spokesman for the society. ''The dog went in there, sniffed around and pounced on a cart which had a thing that looks like a bullet that's a foot long. It's a shell from the Civil War.''</p>
        <p>The Secret Service agents took the dog to another part of the building, but twice the dog returned -- once after the vault had been closed.</p>
        <p>''We don't think it's still a live shell,'' Mr. Desmond said. ''We just think it still has some gunpowder aroma to it.''</p>
        <p>Play a Little, Record a Little</p>
        <p>Now, about that amateurish-sounding rendition of ''Seventy-Six Trombones'' that ends the new cast recording of ''The Music Man.''  There is a reason why that minute's worth of music lacks the polish and precision of the rest of the big orchestral numbers on the recording: ''It's people who've been playing for a month getting through a song,'' said CRAIG BIERKO, who plays Professor Harold Hill in the revival of the 1957 Meredith Willson musical.</p>
        <p>In other words, the cast -- not the pit orchestra heard in the other tracks on the recording -- played the trombones, trumpets and tubas in that number. And the cast was not chosen for its virtuosity on brass instruments. Mr. Bierko, for example, had never played a trombone.</p>
        <p>''The jury's still out whether I'm playing trombone,'' he said before yesterday's party at Chelsea Bar and Billiards to celebrate the recording's release. ''I play a lot of instruments a little bit. I can play a little banjo, a little guitar, a little piano. Learning the trombone was a completely different animal. Just getting a buzzing sound was hard enough, let alone learning to get tones and then the correct notes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bierko is a kind of Johnny One-Note of the trombone. ''I couldn't play 'Old MacDonald Had a Farm,' '' he said, ''but I can manage this jazzy solo.''</p>
        <p>The One and Only, So It Would Seem</p>
        <p>The author JANE HELLER'S new novel, ''Name Dropping'' (St. Martin's Press), is about two women named Nancy Stern who live on different floors of the same Upper East Side apartment building. The wrong one gets murdered, not to give away too much of the plot or anything.</p>
        <p>After inventing such a story, Ms. Heller began wondering about her own uniqueness: any other Jane Hellers out there? she asked on her Web site:www.janeheller.com</p>
        <p>''Somebody e-mailed a message saying, 'I think I know somebody who knows a Jane Heller,' '' Ms. Heller recalled.</p>
        <p>Soon an e-mail message arrived from the woman the first message-writer knew: '' 'My boyfriend's cousin was married to a Jane Heller. Could that possibly be you?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Heller sent back a message saying no. Heller is not her maiden name, she explained, nor is it the name of her husband's family.</p>
        <p>But the reply was emphatic: ''She's sure it's you.''</p>
        <p>The next message to Ms. Heller clinched it: ''Weren't you married to the Paul Heller whose brother is Bruce, whose mother is Ellie, whose father is Larry?'' the message said.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, Ms. Heller had been married in the 1970's to a Paul Heller. After the divorce, she continued to use the name Heller. ''It was easier to spell than my maiden name, Shmerler,'' she said. ''And that's as far as I got at finding another Jane Heller.''</p>
