        <p>Ask Jeffrey Joerres, the chief executive of Manpower Inc., the huge temporary-help agency, whether he can see a slowdown in the economy and he explains that the demand for temporary workers remains strong -- except for one group.</p>
        <p>Manpower supplies nearly 80,000 temporary workers a day for small companies that assemble all sorts of small products and parts. ''We are starting to see a little bit of a tail-off in light manufacturing,'' Mr. Joerres said.</p>
        <p>This spring, similar evidence of slower economic growth is budding in more than a few industries. Wall Street calls attention to each new bud as one more reason for the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates, removing an albatross that holds down stock prices. But in the view of some Fed officials, the signals are still too ambiguous to conclude that the economy is actually beginning to slow.</p>
        <p>Several Fed policy makers have suggested in speeches over the last 10 days that they remain concerned about growth, although William J. McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a question-and-answer period after a speech yesterday that ''a number of variables'' suggest that a slowdown is becoming visible, Reuters reported.</p>
        <p>Mr. McDonough referred mainly to retail sales, which fell 0.3 percent in May, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. They had dropped 0.6 percent during April.</p>
        <p>Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, also spoke yesterday, but he discussed productivity, making no reference to the current strength or weakness of the economy.</p>
        <p>While the Fed's policy makers may decide to keep short-term interest rates steady at their next meeting, in two weeks, their speeches and comments indicate that another increase is likely -- if not in late June, than later in the summer, unless further evidence makes clear that the higher cost of credit is bringing down economic growth enough to damp inflation.</p>
        <p>''The economy surged over the winter, and that surge is now disappearing, but we are still operating at pretty high rates of economic growth,'' said Peter Hooper, chief United States economist for Deutsche Bank North America.</p>
        <p>What the Fed's policy makers decide could affect the November election. Not since late 1967 and early 1968 has the Fed pushed up interest rates by so much in the early months of a presidential election, before the nominating conventions. And in the election that followed, Richard M. Nixon brought the Republican Party back to the White House. The six Fed rate increases since last June have added 1.75 percentage points to the federal funds rate on overnight loans among financial institutions, compared with 2.13 percentage points in the 1967-1968 period. The increases have raised the costs of mortgages, car loans, home equity loans and all sorts of commercial credit. The effect has been most visible in a decline in the purchases of homes and autos, and in retail sales.</p>
        <p>The sales of autos and other vehicles, for example, peaked at an annual rate of 19.1 million in February and have since fallen to 17.5 million. The automakers are adding incentives to prevent sales from falling more, but the 19.1 million was a record and the 17.5 million is higher than in most other boom periods, when 15 million was a level to brag about. ''There is no hint of dropping below 15 million in sales,'' said Wynn Van Bussman, corporate economist at DaimlerChrysler.</p>
        <p>The numerous other signs of a slowdown are similarly hard to read. Manpower, for example, continues to send out more than 190,000 workers a day, with jobs in the service sector rising by enough to offset the decline in light manufacturing. Similarly, steel shipments are rising more slowly than last year, and so are sales of corrugated boxes in which so many products are packed. But resistance to big recent price increases in both cases may help to explain the dip, as well as draw-downs from inventories.</p>
        <p>''We are not looking at the most robust demand we have ever seen,'' said Tom Pagano, vice president for corporate planning at the Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation, a big maker of corrugated containers, ''but we are not looking at weak demand either.''</p>
        <p>So is the economy experiencing a temporary downward blip that will soon fade? Or is this a turning point, the early signs of a significant slowdown as Americans finally respond to higher interest rates? Whatever the answer, the current pace of economic growth -- roughly 4 percent or so in the second quarter, down from 7.3 percent in the fourth and 5.3 percent in the first -- would have been hailed as breakneck expansion in the 1970's, 1980's and early 1990's. But set against the extraordinary backdrop of the last four years, economic growth has to fall below 3.5 percent for several quarters before a slowdown takes hold.</p>
        <p>''There are signs that growth is moderating, but the signs are still early,'' said Martin Bailey, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
        <p>Rising oil and gasoline prices play a role. They are diverting $50 billion a year into fuel payments that consumers might have spent elsewhere. Oil companies are just beginning to recycle the money into the economy, in the form of more drilling and other investments, said Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.</p>
        <p>Corporate purchases of desktop computers have softened, but laptop sales are robust and so are consumer purchases of desktops. ''There is still strong demand among households for Internet access and for multiple computers in the home,'' said Bruce Stephen, an analyst at the International Data Corporation.</p>
        <p>There are other mixed signals. The Boeing Company, for example, is on track to deliver 490 airliners this year, a sharp drop from the 620 last year and 563 in 1998 but the fourth- best year since the current expansion began in 1991. ''We have gone through 24 months of downsizing because of the decreasing order base,'' said Peter Conte, a Boeing spokesman, ''and we believe our year-end employment will be in the range where it is now.''</p>
        <p>Apart from aircraft and weaponry, capital spending on machinery and equipment -- a big source of the robust expansion -- has risen lately, not fallen, reaching an annual rate of $613 billion in the first quarter and $635.8 billion in April. Still, there are chinks. For example, Caterpillar has reported a decline since March in sales of the big diesel engines that power tractor-trailers. Truck drivers are buying more used rigs, which are plentiful, and fewer new ones now that fuel prices are high.</p>
        <p>The huge service sector also appears to be holding its own, expanding at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, down only one-tenth of a percentage point from early this year, according to the Economic Cycle Research Institute. But there are chinks here, too. Airline travel rose more in May than in any other month this year, according to the Air Transport Association. But overnight package delivery has grown more slowly in the United States in recent months.</p>
        <p>Consumer confidence is higher than ever, but the University of Michigan's Consumer Surveys finds that people are no longer rushing to buy homes as mortgage rates rise. ''Where earlier they favored purchasing in anticipation of higher rates,'' said Richard Curtin, director of the surveys, ''now they feel the rates are high enough to justify postponement of home purchases.''</p>
        <p>Nowhere are the signals of slowdown flashing more strongly than in lending. Consumer borrowing, while still rising, is doing so at half of January's clip, and corporate defaults on public debt are rising sharply -- 47 defaults so far this year, totaling $10.7 billion, compared with 89 in all of 1999, totaling $24.2 billion. High-yield junk bonds account for all of the defaults, and lenders have grown reluctant to finance the activities of thousands of companies with junk-bond ratings.</p>
        <p>''When the stock market was going gangbusters, people did not notice the defaults,'' said Diane Vazza, head of global fixed-income research at Standard &amp; Poor's. ''Now stocks are volatile and they are noticing.''</p>
        <p>The employment statistics for May were also troubling. While the unemployment rate ticked up only slightly, to 4.1 percent from 3.9 percent, the number of jobs shrank instead of growing, the first time that had happened in more than four years. The May numbers may turn out to be an aberration, but job growth over the last five months is lower on average than in the final five months of 1999.</p>
