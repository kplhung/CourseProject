        <p>Bug-Killer.com works with companies and individuals who think they are being bugged by competitors; we help them locate hidden eavesdropping equipment and telephone line taps. I work mostly all night. Typically, we're in situations that we don't understand. That's what makes it partly so interesting. We know that there's a problem, but we don't know what the problem is.</p>
        <p>The problem might be that our client is just overly concerned. It might be that someone has put listening devices in our client's offices. Or it might be that someone is trying to get information out of the organization, and that's what sends the alarm.</p>

        <p>Bug-Killer.com works with companies and individuals who think they are being bugged by competitors; we help them locate hidden eavesdropping equipment and telephone line taps. I work mostly all night. Typically, we're in situations that we don't understand. That's what makes it partly so interesting. We know that there's a problem, but we don't know what the problem is.</p>
        <p>The problem might be that our client is just overly concerned. It might be that someone has put listening devices in our client's offices. Or it might be that someone is trying to get information out of the organization, and that's what sends the alarm.</p>
        <p>While we work, we have to continually force ourselves to do two things that aren't normal. The first is we can't talk to each other about what we're doing, and the second is we have to keep telling ourselves that we really don't know what's going on. If I've found something and say, ''Hey, I know what's happening here,'' I've probably missed other stuff. It's a weird job where you have to do these sorts of things, continually say to yourself, ''I don't have the whole story; I need to learn more.''</p>
        <p>Usually, the stuff we find has been put in in a hurry. People will put something in in a way that lets them get in and out quickly. That means that we tend to find things above dropped ceilings, stuck under desks and hidden behind books.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, our company, which is part of Future Focus Inc., did the home of a communications company president who had three cordless phones. All were defective, easy to intercept. We put him in the truck, which we call the sweep mobile, and drove half a mile away. His mansion was on a hill, so the conversations we picked up for him were being broadcast farther than average. He was pretty shocked.</p>
        <p>Our advice to him and other people with cordless phones is to smash them with a hammer unless they are a particular type that uses red spectrum modulation. That technology is very good in preventing people from listening to you.</p>
        <p>One case involved a whistle-blower in a government organization who said people were monitoring her conversations at home. Her co-workers had found out how to use her home answering machine to listen into the room. About 50 percent of home answering machines you buy in the store can do that.</p>
        <p>I explain to people that we cost as much as plumbers do. There are always low bidders, but they may be criminals who want access to bosses' offices so they can plant something. Or maybe they're just wannabe spy-fighters who spent $500 for equipment when you really need to be bringing in something like $100,000 worth.</p>
        <p>What I enjoy most about the job is the thrill of the hunt. The most satisfying one we did was a woman who called up and said, ''I think I'm going crazy.'' We typically don't work for people who are crazy. Our work would not change their lives, and unless our report can change someone's life, we feel we are stealing their money. But we found a number of listening devices in her home. She really did feel better.</p>
