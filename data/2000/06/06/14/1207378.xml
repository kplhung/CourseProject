        <p>In the last two decades, women have made significant inroads in male-dominated professions. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 1983 only 7 percent of dentists were women. Today, 17 percent are. In 1983, 15 percent of lawyers were women. Now, 29 percent are. Even police officers and security guards have an increased representation of women -- 21 percent versus 13 percent.</p>
        <p>But what 's happening on the reverse side of sexual equality in the workplace? Are men elbowing their way into traditionally female professions, notably nursing, teaching and airline service? In a word: no. In fact, in two of those fields, men have actually lost ground in recent years.</p>

        <p>In the last two decades, women have made significant inroads in male-dominated professions. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 1983 only 7 percent of dentists were women. Today, 17 percent are. In 1983, 15 percent of lawyers were women. Now, 29 percent are. Even police officers and security guards have an increased representation of women -- 21 percent versus 13 percent.</p>
        <p>But what 's happening on the reverse side of sexual equality in the workplace? Are men elbowing their way into traditionally female professions, notably nursing, teaching and airline service? In a word: no. In fact, in two of those fields, men have actually lost ground in recent years.</p>
        <p>While the proportion of registered nurses who are women has fallen slightly since 1983, to 93 from 96 percent, the percentage of women has increased among noncollege-level teachers to 75 percent from 71 percent and among flight attendants to 84 percent from 74 percent.</p>
        <p>If that seems like a return to the old days, the pay picture is more disturbing: As the wage gap between men and women has narrowed in the work force as a whole, it has widened in the women-dominated professions.</p>
        <p>Is there an explanation? Jewell C. Gould, research director for the American Federation of Teachers, says in his profession at least, a disproportionate influx of female teachers at the bottom of the pay scale has lowered the median pay for women as a whole.</p>
