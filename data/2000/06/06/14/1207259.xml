        <p>Pushing its habitual brinkmanship to the latest brink, the Shas Party said today that its ministers would quit the Israeli governing coalition at the next cabinet meeting on order from its rabbis.</p>
        <p>Despite the announcement, which is being taken more seriously than previous ultimatums by the rigorously Orthodox Shas, the party is expected to continue negotiating with Prime Minister Ehud Barak through the weekend in an effort to salvage a mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
        <p>If the Shas ministers do resign, they will leave Mr. Barak with a minority government, which would  hobble him as he heads into a period of important peacemaking decisions with the Palestinians. They would also propel a rightist drive to hold new elections into a higher gear.</p>
        <p>At the same time, they would divest themselves of their control of government ministries, a power that is keenly central to Shas, which is  built on a social movement providing services and religious education to the poor and the working class.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, after a decision by their spiritual leaders, Shas's politicians said today that they would not continue inside a government that does not respect them or award them sufficient money to bail out their indebted and corruption-tainted school system.</p>
        <p>''The decision to leave the coalition is final,'' said Eli Yishai, the Shas leader. But he also said that last December and eventually reneged on his words.</p>
        <p>Indicating that he would not push the escalating political crisis to a boil, Mr. Barak announced tonight that the next cabinet meeting would not be held until Sunday so that talks could continue. And even after that meeting, the government would have 48 negotiating hours until the ministers' resignations took effect.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak's government was thrown into tumult last week when Parliament, by a substantial majority, approved a preliminary bill to disperse and head toward new elections. Shas not only voted against the government in which it serves -- as did two other coalition parties -- but it also supported the bill's introduction and guaranteed its victory.</p>
        <p>Angered after many months of what he considered patient deliberations with Shas over its demands, Mr. Barak announced that any minister who had voted against the government would be dismissed. But then he backed down, and plunged back into negotiations last weekend.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Israeli right wing, which has been weak and splintered, began showing new signs of life. Ariel Sharon, a former defense minister and head of the opposition Likud Party, predicted that there would be new elections within a year and that he would beat Mr. Barak.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon said he is working on resuscitating the nationalist opposition by trying to build a block of parties opposed to significant concessions at the peace table.</p>
