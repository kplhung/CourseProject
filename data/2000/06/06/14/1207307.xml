        <p>The Kremlin's chief prosecutor today arrested and jailed Vladimir A. Gusinsky, head of a media empire that has sharply criticized the government.</p>
        <p>The arrest roused fears of suppression of the press. But President Vladimir V. Putin, traveling abroad, insisted that the arrest was an unwelcome surprise to him.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor said Mr. Gusinsky had been arrested on suspicion of embezzling at least $10 million in federal property, apparently related to the purchase of a government-owned television station in St. Petersburg in the mid-1990's.</p>
        <p>His detention capped weeks of government-orchestrated pressure on his Media-Most news organization, which includes Russia's lone independent television network and numerous newspapers. The pressure included attempts to call in loans and a spectacular police raid last month on the company headquarters here.</p>
        <p>The arrest loosed a torrent of protest from Mr. Gusinsky's supporters and enemies, many of whom worried aloud that the move signaled a new era of repression under Mr. Putin. But Mr. Putin suggested that he was as shocked by the detention as almost anyone else. Mr. Gusinsky was seized hours after Mr. Putin had left Moscow on a weeklong diplomatic tour. After landing in Madrid, his first stop, Mr. Putin called the arrest ''a dubious present for me'' and insisted that he had no advance knowledge of it.</p>
        <p>''I hope the prosecutor has sufficient reasons for this step,'' he said. ''I will find out all the circumstances tonight, and I will have my own viewpoint.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's comments left open various explanations for the arrest and its timing. One was that the president was trying to insulate himself from what was certain to be a sharp reaction from Western leaders whom he is to meet this week. Another explanation was that Kremlin officials had ordered the arrest behind Mr. Putin's back, either to punish Mr. Gusinsky or to embarrass the president.</p>
        <p>Last month, after the raids on the Media-Most office, Mr. Putin insisted that the actions had to do with possible crimes, not press freedoms, and he criticized the company for contending otherwise. ''No attempt at blackmail in relation to law enforcement is permissible,'' Mr. Putin said at that time. ''Just as limits on freedoms of speech and of the mass media are not permissible.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has attacked journalists as unhelpful and, in the context of the Chechnya war, even traitorous. In recent weeks, Kremlin officials have closed a television station in St. Petersburg and announced plans to require the licensing of all newspapers.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Media-Most, Dmitri Ostalsky, called the arrest a pretext for further curbs on press freedoms. ''It is obvious that this has been drummed up,'' Mr. Ostalsky said. ''And we can make no other evaluation than to say that the authority has launched an outright repression against the owners of the independent media.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky's jousting with Kremlin critics has made Media-Most something of a cause celebre among Western advocates of press freedom.</p>
        <p>President Clinton indirectly expressed support for Mr. Gusinsky during his visit here last week by giving his sole interview to a radio station owned by Media-Most.</p>
        <p>In Washington, reacting to the arrest, a spokesman for the White House, Joe Lockhart, said: ''We do have a concern about press freedom in Russia, and that concern was expressed directly to President Putin in his meeting with President Clinton. We're going to want to take a look at this and understand the details. But we are quite concerned about some of the steps that have been taken against the free media.''</p>
        <p>A former theatrical producer, Mr. Gusinsky built his empire after the Soviet Union collapsed. Besides the NTV television network, the only one outside state control that has a national reach, his holdings include a Moscow newspaper, Sevodnya; a newsmagazine, Itogi, a joint venture with Newsweek; and Ekho Moskvy, the popular Moscow newsradio station that Mr. Clinton visited.</p>
        <p>The empire includes a publishing house and a film production company. Plans for a multiplex movie theater in downtown Moscow are in the works, although they had been suspended after the financial crisis in 1998.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky is also a leader of the Jewish minority who has often been a target of anti-Semitic attacks. He has taken his business to Israel, where he also holds citizenship, and to the United States. Media-Most bought a 42 percent stake in the Internet business of Israel's state telephone company together with its Israeli partner, Maariv Holdings. NTV International began broadcasting last year to viewers in the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky has clashed with the government before. In the early 90's, President Boris N. Yeltsin's officials raided Media-Most. But the conflict has seldom been as sharp as now.</p>
        <p>Why is a matter of speculation. One school suggests that Mr. Putin's seemingly sure purchase on the reins of government is nowhere near as strong as it is made to seem and that he is actually beholden to insiders, holdovers from the clan that ran the Kremlin under Mr. Yeltsin and that is linked to tycoons and vested interests. In that view, the arrest today was muscle flexing by a group that has run Russia through Mr. Putin for some time.</p>
        <p>Either way, it shows ''incredible stupidity'' on Mr. Putin's part, said Michael McFaul, a Russian political expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''It shows either that he is not in control -- and that's a bad sign -- or that he is in control. And that is a bad sign.''</p>
        <p>Some, including Mr. Gusinsky, tie the actions against Media-MOST to the Kremlin chief of staff under both Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Putin, Aleksandr Voloshin. Mr. Voloshin is considered an ally of tycoons opposed to Mr. Gusinsky, including a major financier and legislator, Boris Berezovsky.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky supported Mr. Yeltsin's re-election campaign in 1996 against Communist opposition -- and benefited handsomely. After Mr. Yeltsin had won a second term, NTV received a license for daytime broadcasting.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gusinsky's support soured as Mr. Yeltsin's second term degenerated into intrigue and economic collapse. In the last two elections, for Parliament and the presidency, Media-Most outlets have been consistently skeptical of, if not outright opposed to, Mr. Putin and his allies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky recently contended that Mr. Voloshin had sought to bribe him to support the Kremlin in the campaigns, and failed. Mr. Gusinsky recounted: ''Voloshin said, as if he was joking: 'Let's pay you $100 million so that you won't be in our way while the election is on. You could go on a vacation.' ''</p>
        <p>Tonight, Boris Nemtsov, a market reformer and a former Kremlin aide, faulted Mr. Voloshin for the arrest. ''There is complete chaos in the Kremlin administration,'' Mr. Nemtsov said. ''This was done by Voloshin. And if Putin is not a hypocrite, he has to fire him.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, NTV broadcast a stream of accusations and complaints about the arrest, many by top political and business figures. A senior official under Mr. Yeltsin, Oleg Sysuyev, said the move was politically motivated. ''In the eyes of the public,'' Mr. Sysuyev said, ''this will look like a political execution.''</p>
