        <p>YOU half expect to find the door covered with cobwebs and a couple of clerks sitting around playing solitaire on the computer. But even before the unemployment office opens here Monday morning, 20 exiles from the job-rich economy are awaiting sanctuary.</p>
        <p>There's an account analyst who recently lost his job with a firm that advises companies in bankruptcy. There's a financial counselor whose job at a health clinic was eliminated in a state financing cut. There's a former Toys ''R'' Us salesman.</p>
        <p>''You hear on TV that there's 3 percent unemployment,'' Nicholas Riccio said, ''but a lot of people don't believe it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Riccio is one of them. He recently lost his job as a metal polisher in a medical device factory that suffered competition from overseas. Suddenly he found himself on the unemployment line. ''I always had a job,'' Mr. Riccio said. ''I'm 73, but I'm looking for a job. I don't want to sit around.''</p>
        <p>Unemployment figures remain stellar, even if they have slipped recently. The national rate has risen just slightly from the 30-year low of 3.9 percent recorded earlier this year. Here in Union County, the unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, just below the state's 3.8 percent rate.</p>
        <p>But the unemployment office is still open for business, and the sidewalk outside is a chat room for tales of woe often muffled in the booming economy.</p>
        <p>''It's a little bit odd standing in this line,'' Kathy Cherry said. ''I've been working since I'm 16.'' She worked steadily for 25 years, the last 9 as a financial counselor at a state-financed hospital clinic, until it shut down in April.</p>
        <p>She knows there are jobs to be had, but it is hard without a college degree. ''I guess they're really going to the college grads with M.A.'s and B.A.'s,'' she said. ''They really want education over experience.''</p>
        <p>BUT even among the unemployed in this working-class city, where the job market improved with the recent opening of a huge discount mall, the economy breeds optimism.</p>
        <p>''Nowadays you can find a job anywhere,'' said William Montalbo, 23, a junior at Union County College. He  lost his job at Toys ''R'' Us a few months ago (he said the boss didn't like him) and collected unemployment benefits for a month before taking a job in cellular phone sales. He was at the employment office on Monday to help a friend navigate the system. ''It's a benefit you have,'' Mr. Montalbo said of unemployment payments. ''Use it. Why not?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Montalbo's touch-and-go view of unemployment fits government officials' vision of how the benefit should be used. But the office on North Broad Street still draws the hard-core unemployed whose misfortunes seem impervious to economic trends.</p>
        <p>Karaema Thomas, 27, said that since losing her job at McDonald's a few months back, she has worked as a prostitute in Newark. A high school graduate, Ms. Thomas said that she once worked as a home health aide, but that her license lapsed while she was recovering from head injuries  after being mugged. ''I've degraded myself, but I have to eat,'' she said. ''It's hard.'' She was denied unemployment benefits, but said she would not consider applying for welfare because ''it's not a lot of money and you have to go through verbal abuse.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Thomas was with a friend, Mecca Daniels, 25, who said she had sold drugs for money and spent three years in prison. The women said they struck out applying for jobs and were mystified that some considered these flush times. ''The economy stinks,'' Ms. Thomas said. ''You have to do what you have to do to get by.''</p>
        <p>For most people, getting by is easier with the economy strong.</p>
        <p>A 25-year-old man named Namil said he started playing the markets while collecting unemployment benefits and seeking a better computer job. ''I got into investments, commodities futures,'' he said. ''Soybeans, cotton, corn.'' He lost his computer tech support job a few months ago. He said he was working part-time jobs he hoped would lead to a permanent work. ''I need a little more experience,'' said Namil, who would not give his last name. ''Another year, I'll be fine. This is just temporary.''</p>
        <p>No one knows what temporary means in today's economy better than Patti Jackson, a clerk in the unemployment office for 11 years until she was laid off last month. With claims declining, Ms. Jackson, 47, said she went on unemployment herself, hoping the economy would take care of her one way or the other.</p>
        <p>It did. The unemployment office apparently needed extra help this week. So Monday morning, Ms. Jackson was sitting behind a desk here, with a big smile for her former brethren on the unemployment line.</p>
        <p>''This is a transitional time,'' she said.</p>
