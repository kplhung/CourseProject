        <p>Johnny Rolling's fingernails were showing signs of wear yesterday.</p>
        <p>The ends were somewhat ragged and the cuticles frayed as he was sentenced in Manhattan Criminal Court to 50 years to life in prison for a string of 17 vicious nail-salon robberies in which he posed as a customer. In at least one case, he even had his nails trimmed before he committed the robbery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rolling, who was once known as ''the manicured bandit,'' drew the harsh sentence in part because of the weapons he sometimes used: nail scissors, a razor blade and a knife.</p>
        <p>At one salon, Mr. Rolling's hands were so well groomed that he aroused suspicion.</p>
        <p>''He didn't need a manicure,'' the proprietor of the Sunny Nail Salon at Union Square recalled shortly after the robbery, ''His nails already looked pretty good.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Rolling's days of hand lotion and orange sticks were put behind him when he appeared in rumpled gray sweats before Judge Michael J. Obus.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Rolling declined to speak in court, a prosecutor described him as a pattern robber with violent tendencies and an intimidating presence. Three armed officers flanked Mr. Rolling, a bald and bearded six-footer who weighs more than 200 pounds.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor called Mr. Rolling, 35, a coward who preyed exclusively on female victims. Usually, he would enter the nail salon and ask for the man in charge. If one was not present, he would ask the price of a manicure, then demand money. In one case, he punched a manicurist in the face when she was not quick enough at the cash register.</p>
        <p>''The defendant chose all hard-working Asian immigrant women, and took their tip money and jewelry,'' said an assistant district attorney, Jeanne Olivo, who elaborated on each of Mr. Rolling's robberies, including one at a cosmetics store.</p>
        <p>In one bizarre case, Ms. Olivo said, Mr. Rolling re-entered a nail salon that he had originally robbed, wearing glasses and claiming to be a police officer investigating the robbery.</p>
        <p>He was recognized and chased from the salon.</p>
        <p>One of the police officers who captured him, Detective Deborah Lanigan, said after yesterday's sentencing that she had looked at Mr. Rolling's nails when he was arrested in 1998 and that they looked ''pretty good.''.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rolling, who frequently laid the blame for his crime sprees on an abusive childhood and heroin use, would not even admit to the condition of his hands. As Detective Lanigan recalled, ''He said to me when we locked him up, 'Do I look like I get my nails done?' ''</p>
