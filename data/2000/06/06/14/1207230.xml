        <p>Friday night's show at Aaron Davis Hall -- which brought together within one extraordinary band the pianist Andrew Hill, the saxophonist Jackie McLean, the vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, the drummer Billy Higgins and the bassist Scott Colley -- was a one-time corral of great musicians that had ''jazz festival'' written all over it: it takes curatorial motivation to make this happen. And though it could have been produced by any of New York's three major jazz festivals and attracted an audience anywhere from the Lower East Side to Carnegie Hall to Harlem (where it did in fact happen), it wasn't a festival concert at all but part of Aaron Davis Hall's independently produced jazz series.</p>
        <p>Too bad it turned out to be less than the sum of its parts. The concept was a casual, easygoing abstract with guiding motifs: there were open harmonies, shifting rhythms, group ideas formed in collective splinters and finally a return to the theme. This was a key idiom of the mid-1960's, when everyone on stage except the young Mr. Colley became important in jazz, and it is a style in which the musicians rarely play anymore.</p>

        <p>Friday night's show at Aaron Davis Hall -- which brought together within one extraordinary band the pianist Andrew Hill, the saxophonist Jackie McLean, the vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, the drummer Billy Higgins and the bassist Scott Colley -- was a one-time corral of great musicians that had ''jazz festival'' written all over it: it takes curatorial motivation to make this happen. And though it could have been produced by any of New York's three major jazz festivals and attracted an audience anywhere from the Lower East Side to Carnegie Hall to Harlem (where it did in fact happen), it wasn't a festival concert at all but part of Aaron Davis Hall's independently produced jazz series.</p>
        <p>Too bad it turned out to be less than the sum of its parts. The concept was a casual, easygoing abstract with guiding motifs: there were open harmonies, shifting rhythms, group ideas formed in collective splinters and finally a return to the theme. This was a key idiom of the mid-1960's, when everyone on stage except the young Mr. Colley became important in jazz, and it is a style in which the musicians rarely play anymore.</p>
        <p>The rhythm section fared all right; Mr. Higgins had the best night of all, keeping loose time on his ride cymbal and performing a few solos that were beautifully structured. Mr. Higgins lets you hear individual parts of his drum kit, and concentrates on the beauty of their sound -- ride cymbal, snare, bass drum. His improvisations are thinking experiences, and Mr. Colley played deferentially with him, giving him room. But it was the frontlineplayers who ran into trouble.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hill, more than most regularly performing jazz pianists, needs a careful structure around him, usually one of his own making. He is not a jam-session type. So his rhythmic displacements and blase-sounding repeated chords did not achieve a stamina of their own.  Whatever pianists and vibraphonists play together onstage, they probably should not play a lot of chords at the same time; unfortunately, it happened too often with Mr. Hill and Mr. Hutcherson -- too bad, because some well-defined, beautifully played ideas of Mr. Hutcherson's got drowned. And though Mr. McLean started out energetically, curling short bursts of bebop around the tangled music at the center, he finally grew disconnected.</p>
        <p>The short set included Mr. Hill's ''Ball Square'' and ''15/8,'' sight-read by the musicians, and, strangely enough, ''The Star-Spangled Banner.'' At moments, when one or two players sat out, light shone through: a bit of piano-bass-drums, a bit of vibes-bass-drums. It was possible to imagine the band separating, essentially, into three trios, with the frontline players leading the way. And perhaps more could have been made of the pianist Jason Moran's trio, which opened the concert, and the saxophonist Greg Osby, a guest during Mr. Moran's set; these musicians are the direct aesthetic beneficiaries of the artists that headlined. That may sound too ambitious, but it is probably less ambitious than what was attempted.</p>
