        <p>Rallies for More School Money  Advocacy groups have banded together in the New York State Schools Coalition, hoping to unite parents, students, teachers, neighborhood organizations and unions into a powerful force that will pressure state lawmakers to allot more money for education.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the founders of the coalition held rallies in Manhattan and Buffalo to publicize their effort. The New York City schools chancellor, HAROLD O. LEVY, and WILLIAM C. THOMPSON Jr., president of the Board of Education, were among the speakers at the Manhattan rally.</p>
        <p>The driving forces behind the coalition are Acorn, an advocacy group for poor neighborhoods, and Citizen Action of New York, a watchdog group. DOUG TURETSKY, a spokesman for the coalition, said its members would hold rallies throughout the state, testify at budget hearings and campaign against state lawmakers who vote against increases in education financing.</p>
        <p>$500,000 for All That Jazz</p>
        <p>The Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation has committed about $500,000 for a visiting professorship each year for five years at Columbia University's Center for Jazz Studies, a program that explores the role of jazz in American culture.</p>
        <p>The center, which opened in September 1999, is run by ROBERT O'MEALLY. The visiting professors, Mr. O'Meally said, will be leading scholars in the humanities, arts or social sciences who have made significant contributions to an understanding of jazz and its influence. Candidates will teach one upper-level undergraduate or graduate seminar each semester in jazz studies.</p>
        <p>From CUNY, Doctorates in Urban Education</p>
        <p>Eager to contribute more to solving the education problems of New York and other American cities, the City University of New York is creating a doctoral program in urban education. The trustees on CUNY's academic affairs committee approved the program last week, and the full board is expected to grant its approval later this month. Pending approval by the state, the program would begin taking students in September 2001.</p>
        <p>Although CUNY is already the largest single source of New York City teachers, faculty members at the university thought that there ought to be a Ph.D. program and more research on the issues facing urban schools. ''What is distinctive about our program is that there will be a very substantial bringing together of the educational disciplines with the liberal arts and sciences disciplines, like anthropology, sociology and economics,'' said JAY L. LEMKE, a theoretical physicist and professor of education at Brooklyn College who led the effort to develop the program.</p>
        <p>A Former Mayor to Speak at Fieldston</p>
        <p>DAVID DINKINS, the former New York City mayor, will address the 121 members of the graduating class of Fieldston School tomorrow at the school's campus in Riverdale, the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dinkins (left), who teaches at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and is the host of a radio program on WLIB-AM, is the father of two Fieldston alumni, DAVID Jr., class of 1972, and DONNA DINKINS-HOGGARD, class of 1975.</p>
