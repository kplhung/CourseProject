        <p>Gold Fields Ltd. became the first South African gold producer to merge with a foreign counterpart today, a deal with the Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation of Canada, creating a mining giant with a combined market value of $3.4 billion.</p>
        <p>The transaction partly reflects the global pressure on gold producers to combine and keep costs low, best positioning themselves for the possibility that the prolonged slump in gold prices will end.</p>
        <p>For South Africa, the deal represents an effort by another big corporate name in a mainstay domestic industry to reduce exposure to the country's political and economic problems, joining others like De Beers and AngloGold that have diversified abroad.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the deal, the new company, called Gold Fields International, will have its principal headquarters in Toronto and a presence in Johannesburg. Its main stock listing will be in Toronto. Each company's shareholders will own 50 percent.</p>
        <p>While other foreign mining companies, like Placer Dome of Vancouver, British Columbia, have purchased stakes in South African gold deposits, the merger announced today is the first between a South African and a foreign producer.</p>
        <p>The new company is expected to produce 4.4 million ounces of gold a year and, as the original Gold Fields did, will rank third in world production, behind AngloGold and Newmont Mining of Denver.</p>
        <p>Franco-Nevada, based in Toronto, relies primarily on royalties generated by its international array of joint ventures, while Gold Fields, based here, is a traditional mining house and owns and operates virtually all its holdings, most of them in South Africa.</p>
        <p>Both partners have strong balance sheets, and the new company would stand to benefit from any upswing in the price of gold. Angus Auchterlonie, an analyst at SG Securities in Johannesburg, said that was certainly a prime consideration for the deal.</p>
        <p>While low by historical standards, futures prices have risen from $270 an ounce two weeks ago to $288.10 today on gold for August delivery, near the highest level in three months. ''There is a significant upside if you think the price goes up,'' Mr. Auchterlonie said. ''They wanted to create a globally diversified company that is very well geared to gold going up.''</p>
        <p>Seymour Schulich, chairman of Franco-Nevada, and Pierre Lassonde, its president, will become the co-chairmen of the new company, while Chris Thompson, chairman and chief executive of Gold Fields, will become the president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>''This merger is a leap for Gold Fields into the international arena that could not be achieved through organic growth alone,'' Mr. Thompson said in a statement released by the companies.</p>
