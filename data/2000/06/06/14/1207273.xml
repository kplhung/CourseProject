        <p>Describing himself as frightened and self-absorbed, a Brooklyn police officer testified yesterday that he was thinking about protecting his career, his family's future and his fellow officers when he lied to federal agents about what he saw in a Flatbush station house on the night that Abner Louima was savagely assaulted there three years ago.</p>
        <p>In a full day of testimony in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, the officer, Francisco Rosario, was by turns flustered and calm as he admitted that he gave a false account to federal prosecutors.</p>

        <p>Describing himself as frightened and self-absorbed, a Brooklyn police officer testified yesterday that he was thinking about protecting his career, his family's future and his fellow officers when he lied to federal agents about what he saw in a Flatbush station house on the night that Abner Louima was savagely assaulted there three years ago.</p>
        <p>In a full day of testimony in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, the officer, Francisco Rosario, was by turns flustered and calm as he admitted that he gave a false account to federal prosecutors.</p>
        <p>''I was scared,'' Officer Rosario acknowledged on the witness stand, his chin held high and his voice subdued but steady, as he discussed the investigations in the weeks after the August 1997 attack. ''A captain who was on vacation got transferred. Cops were getting suspended. What were they going to do to me?''</p>
        <p>Moments later, Officer Rosario, responding to a question from Alan Vinegrad, the chief prosecutor, said he lied out of concern for himself, his family and his colleagues.</p>
        <p>''You lied,'' Mr. Vinegrad suggested, ''because you didn't want to give information that would get another cop in trouble, right?''</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' Officer Rosario replied.</p>
        <p>''Because you didn't want to end up as a witness in any prosecution of the Louima case, right?'' Mr. Vinegrad went on. Again, the response was yes.</p>
        <p>''So,'' Mr. Vinegrad eventually said, his voice nearly squeaking with disbelief. ''You didn't give a thought about Mr. Louima -- just yourself?''</p>
        <p>''At that point, yes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Officer Rosario has been charged with lying twice to the Federal Bureau of Investigation during two interviews concerning the assault on Mr. Louima, who was sodomized with a broken broom handle in the restroom of the 70th Precinct station house. The government contends that the officer lied in September 1997 by saying that he was not inside the station house arrest room when Mr. Louima, reeking of feces and with his pants pulled down, was put in a cell there. Although Officer Rosario eventually admitted that he was in the room, the government has argued that he lied again by saying that Officer Thomas Bruder, not Justin A. Volpe, placed Mr. Louima in the cell moments after the attack.</p>
        <p>Officer Bruder was convicted in March, along with Officers Charles Schwarz and Thomas Wiese, of plotting to cover up the assault. Mr. Volpe pleaded guilty in May 1999 to committing the attack. The plea came in the middle of a trial in which Mr. Schwarz, too, was eventually found to have participated in the assault.</p>
        <p>What was unusual about yesterday's testimony -- in this, the third trial stemming from the assault on Mr. Louima -- was that Officer Rosario apparently admitted to the very charges he is trying to defeat. Although he acknowledged that he lied at first to federal agents about his whereabouts on the night of the assault, his defense lawyers have argued that those lies, while ethically compromised, do not constitute a crime.</p>
        <p>Officer Rosario also maintains that his statement that it was Officer Bruder who put Mr. Louima in the cell was not deliberately false. But during Mr. Vinegrad's cross-examination he admitted that ''it could have been Volpe'' who put Mr. Louima in the cell. ''I didn't see his face,'' Officer Rosario testified.</p>
        <p>Under questioning by his lawyer, Raymond Granger, Officer Rosario testified that four days after the assault, as he was waiting to speak with investigators from the department's Internal Affairs Bureau, an official of the patrolman's union suggested that he keep his mouth shut about what he knew.</p>
        <p>''If you saw something, you saw something,'' Officer Rosario quoted Michael Immitt, the union official, as saying. ''But if you didn't see nothing, you didn't see nothing.''</p>
        <p>Virtually from the moment that the authorities began to investigate the assault on Mr. Louima, the federal government has argued that several officers who were in the 70th Precinct station house on the night of the attack have refused to divulge the truth or have done so grudgingly.</p>
        <p>Officer Rosario said his reason for finally telling the truth was that he could no longer take the pressure of secrecy. He said he and his former partner, Rolando Aleman, who has already pleaded guilty to lying in the case, discussed telling the full truth.</p>
        <p>''We talked about coming clean,'' Officer Rosario testified. ''We'd had enough of this. We just wanted to come clean.''</p>
