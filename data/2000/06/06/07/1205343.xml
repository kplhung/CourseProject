        <p>WHILE e-commerce is remaking how business gets done, it is also remaking traditional alliances on tax policy, creating a deep rift within the Republican Party and building common ground between some antitax Republicans and some Democrats who have opposed the antitax agenda.</p>

As more transactions move online, falling revenue would have to be made up either through higher taxes on property, income and off-line sales or through cuts in services.</p>

        <p>WHILE e-commerce is remaking how business gets done, it is also remaking traditional alliances on tax policy, creating a deep rift within the Republican Party and building common ground between some antitax Republicans and some Democrats who have opposed the antitax agenda.</p>
        <p>The unpredictability of the matter extends much further. Efforts to make the Internet a permanent tax-free zone obviously pose problems for off-line businesses. But the most direct impact might be felt by state and local governments, which now receive almost half their revenue from sales taxes. As more transactions move online, falling revenue would have to be made up either through higher taxes on property, income and off-line sales or through cuts in services.</p>
        <p>In 1998, at the behest of e-commerce companies seeking a tax break, Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which prohibited multiple and discriminatory taxes on the Internet and effectively prohibited sales taxes on e-commerce that crosses state lines until 2001.</p>
        <p>Last month, the antitax Republicans in the House leadership pushed for a vote to extend the moratorium for five years, to 2006, even though the current moratorium had 18 months left and even though hearings on the extension were not scheduled until a week after the vote.</p>
        <p>The House Republican leadership pushed through the vote in the face of solid opposition by a traditional Republican constituency, the nation's retailers, from mighty Wal-Mart to local federations of mom-and-pop stores. They all want a level playing field in which there would be no distinctions for sales tax purposes among bricks-and-mortar, clicks-and-mortar and pure cyberspace businesses.</p>
        <p>The moratorium extension is very likely to face a much tougher time in the Senate as retailers step up their lobbying. President Clinton has not said whether he will sign the bill, but the administration's representatives on the Internet tax commission have opposed extending the moratorium.</p>
        <p>The rush to extend the moratorium has brought together Representative Ernest J. Istook Jr. of Oklahoma, one of the most far-right Republicans in Congress, and John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, one of the most far-left Democrats. They made similar arguments against the extension. As Steve Pfister, a senior vice president of the National Retail Federation, which represents merchants with more than 1.5 million stores, observed, ''Internet tax issues are creating really strange bedfellows.''</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Istook and Mr. Conyers expressed concern that the moratorium would take power from state and local governments, which provide the bulk of government services, like police protection and education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Istook wrote to his colleagues that his fellow antitax Republicans have lost sight of the 10th Amendment, which reserves to the states and the people those powers not expressly authorized or denied to the federal government.</p>
        <p>THE argument that opposing an extension of the moratorium means favoring higher taxes, which was promoted by the House leadership, was called bunk by Mr. Istook.</p>
        <p>''Washington politicians,'' he wrote, ''are scrambling to show who can be 'friendliest' to the Internet community -- and win their political support -- even if it means turning a deaf ear to other business and ignoring common sense.'' He also asked whether extending the moratorium was ''a federal power grab, a back-door approach to consolidating all power firmly and finally in Washington?''</p>
        <p>He urged his colleagues to fight high levels of taxes, rather than give a break to one industry. ''Tax justice is not achieved by promoting injustice; tax justice must be based on fairness,'' Mr. Istook wrote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conyers, while not agreeing that taxes are too high, said the state and local tax system was a mess and that by extending the moratorium to 2006, Congress would remove an incentive for the states to streamline sales taxes.</p>
        <p>As much as Americans complain about the complexity of the income tax, the sales tax regimes of 45 states, plus the District of Columbia, are vastly more complex. A can of soda is untaxed as a grocery item in Ohio, for example, but is taxed as a convenience in New York.</p>
        <p>The two congressmen, and many retailers, want to use the rise of e-commerce as a cudgel to force the states to simplify the sales tax, creating standard definitions of items and eliminating picayune rules.</p>
        <p>Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, a Republican who has signed 31 tax cuts into law, is the political leader of those seeking a level playing field; he thinks the issue is both philosophical and economic.</p>
        <p>''The issue is whether local government will be allowed to function independently of the national government and Congress,'' Governor Leavitt said, adding that blocking the states from applying sales taxes to e-commerce is the most significant issue of federalism since the Civil War.</p>
        <p>Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and a leading Republican antitax strategist, sees the same federalism issues from a different perspective.</p>
        <p>''The principle is no taxation without representation,'' Mr. Norquist said. ''You cannot allow Alabama politicians to impose taxes on businesses in Maine and New Hampshire because there is no limit to the abuses that can follow. They can go kick your door in and levy sales taxes on things you bought over the Internet.''</p>
        <p>Governor Leavitt and his allies, however, take strong issue with this view because, they say, they have agreed that collecting sales taxes should not draw a company into other tax, regulatory and litigation issues.</p>
        <p>One idea that Mr. Norquist finds palatable would be to tax all items at the point of sale. Under this theory, Washington State would collect taxes on every book sold by Amazon.com,  based in Seattle, not just those bought by Washington residents.</p>
        <p>Such a policy would encourage e-commerce companies to move to the five states that have no sales tax -- Alaska, Delaware, Oregon, Montana and New Hampshire -- and encourage the other states to reduce sales-tax rates, which Mr. Norquist favors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norquist added: ''The cost of government should be radically falling with all the new technologies. That politicians don't reduce the cost of government is a criticism of the politicians.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Ron Kirk of Dallas, a leader in the level-playing-field camp, said he regarded these comments as nonsense. Computer technologies will reduce many government costs, but Mayor Kirk said: ''The Internet can't replace a fire truck. Cities still have to buy pumpers and ladder trucks and hire firefighters and train them, and we have to have the means to pay for all that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kirk also fears that exempting the Internet from sales taxes will mean more power for Washington, the opposite of the devolution arguments put forth by antitax Republicans, who say that they favor state and local governments. ''I don't think Grover and his people have thought this through,'' Mr. Kirk said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Norquist said that he and other antitax Republicans had indeed thought through the consequences of their position. Exempting e-commerce from sales taxes eliminates a potential source of revenue and furthers the underyling cause, Mr. Norquist said, adding, ''We want less government.''</p>
