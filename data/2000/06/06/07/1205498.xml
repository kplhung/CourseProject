        <p>The young player spread the newspaper on a table and calmly tore out the article about his decreased playing time. He found a roll of athletic tape and affixed the article to the top of his locker stall.</p>
        <p>Jay Payton was letting the world know he was upset.</p>
        <p>Derek Bell, another Mets outfielder, whose first year in the majors was Payton's last in high school, shook his head. Bell took down the article and told Payton he was wrong to display his frustrations. ''Don't give up on yourself or try to be a rebel,'' Bell told Payton after the incident, a few weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Bell makes a point to dispense advice whenever he sees the need. Dave Winfield, a teammate on the 1992 Toronto Blue Jays, encouraged Bell to do this. Now, as Bell's average continues to tumble, he is relying on other lessons he learned as a young player for perspective.</p>
        <p>''You've always got to be positive in this game, stay on an even keel,'' said Bell, who also played for San Diego and Houston before coming to the Mets last December. ''Tony Gwynn told me that.''</p>
        <p>Bell has managed to stay upbeat despite a horrendous slump. He has been given his first two days off this season during the skid, and was twice shifted from his No. 2 spot in the lineup to leadoff. Nothing has worked: in 11 games since May 22, Bell is 3 for 45 (.067). His average has fallen from .360 to .300.</p>
        <p>Before last night's scheduled game against the Baltimore Orioles, which was rained out and will be made up tomorrow night, Bell found something in his swing that he thinks could make a difference.</p>
        <p>Bell, who cured an early-season slump by discovering a flaw in his timing on video, had searched in vain for video clues to this slump. But yesterday, he noticed his hands were starting to move forward before his front leg landed. He made the adjustment during indoor batting practice and was pleased with the results.</p>
        <p>Bell said he is proud he has not let his struggles at bat affect the rest of his game, particularly his defense. Again, he said, that effort comes from advice he received early in his career. ''Devon White told me to never combine your offense with your defense -- always separate them,'' Bell said. ''That's why I can go out and go 0 for 3 with three strikeouts, but if I make four diving catches, I'm as happy as I'd be if I went 3 for 3, because I kept the team in the game.''</p>
        <p>Further, Bell said, after nine years in the majors, he has a realistic sense of his abilities. When he was hot early on -- Bell was batting .385 through April 30 -- he knew he would not maintain that success.</p>
        <p>''Todd Helton's a good hitter,'' Bell said, referring to the Colorado Rockies' first baseman, ''but he's not going to hit .400. I'm a good hitter, but the highest I've hit in the big leagues is .330. I'm still in position to get that, but I've never hit .360. It's good that I started off good and I'm going through this now, so I can be ready for the stretch run.''</p>
        <p>Through his struggles, Bell's demeanor has not changed. He vowed early in the season to always smile -- ''Straight up positive, yo,'' in the Bell vernacular -- and he made the national highlight shows on Monday when he took some cotton candy from a vendor and gave it to a young fan during a pitching change.</p>
        <p>If fans can't tell Bell is struggling by the way he acts, neither can his teammates.</p>
        <p>''He knows he can hit .320, .330, and he'll get back to that,'' said Payton. ''The worst thing you can do is put pressure on yourself. He's been through the highs and the lows, and he knows how to handle them. When you're down like that, and you're off in a funk all the time, it just makes it worse -- it really does.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Mets waited until 7:20 to postpone last night's game, despite persistent rains throughout the day. Only about 100 fans were scattered around Shea Stadium at the time of the announcement. The game will be made up tomorrow at 7:10 p.m.; fans can receive a refund for last night's tickets, or they can use them for the makeup game. ''We were monitoring the forecast all day long, and we were told the rain was supposed to stop around 7:00,'' said the Mets' spokesman, JAY HORWITZ. ''There was supposed to be a break without any rain. As it got closer to 7, the periods of no rain got less and less. As soon as we were certain there was no window to play the game, we called it.''</p>
        <p>Manager BOBBY VALENTINE will push back his rotation so RICK REED pitches tonight, followed by GLENDON RUSCH tomorrow. Valentine said his starters will continue in rotation through the Yankees series, so AL LEITER will start Friday, BOBBY JONES on Saturday and MIKE HAMPTON on Sunday.</p>
