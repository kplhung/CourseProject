        <p>President Clinton will order Medicare to start covering most of the costs of clinical trials testing the value of new drugs and medical treatments for millions of elderly and disabled people, administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton plans to take the action by issuing an ''executive memorandum'' on Wednesday, the officials said.</p>
        <p>People with chronic diseases have long sought such a policy change. White House officials said the change was needed to increase the number of elderly people who participate in studies of ways to prevent, detect and treat all sorts of ailments, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's, arthritis, diabetes and eye disorders.</p>
        <p>About 1 percent of the elderly now participate in clinical trials, even though the burden of many diseases falls disproportionately on the elderly, administration officials said. The comparable figure for younger people participating in clinical trials is higher, officials said, although they could not provide an exact figure.</p>
        <p>Patients, insurance companies and drug companies now often share the costs of clinical research, with much uncertainty about who actually pays how much. That uncertainty often deters people from participating or can mean thousands of dollars in unexpected expenses for people who join the trials.</p>
        <p>The Medicare statute has been widely interpreted to bar reimbursement for the routine medical care that beneficiaries need when they participate in clinical trials. Many private insurers have also denied coverage, saying the treatments were experimental or ''investigational.''</p>
        <p>The federal policy is significant not only because Medicare covers 39 million Americans, but also because many private insurers follow its example in deciding what to cover.</p>
        <p>In a draft of his new directive, President Clinton says, ''I hereby direct the Department of Health and Human Services to revise Medicare program guidance to explicitly authorize payment for Medicare-covered services for clinical trials.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Clinton declared, ''Medicare will immediately begin to reimburse for the routine patient care costs, and costs due to medical complications associated with participation in a clinical trial.''</p>
        <p>Such routine care accounts for the bulk of the cost of most clinical trials.  The sponsors of clinical research, including drug companies, would continue to pay for the analysis of data and other expenses beyond the costs of routine care.</p>
        <p>The new policy, recommended by the National Academy of Sciences and strongly advocated by Vice President Al Gore, applies to treatments for all diseases and disabilities, not just cancer, as in some legislation pending in Congress.</p>
        <p>In a report in December, the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, said, ''Medicare should pay for routine care of beneficiaries enrolled in clinical trials in the same way it pays for this care outside of clinical trials.''</p>
        <p>Several members of Congress had introduced bills authorizing Medicare to help pay the costs of clinical trials in cancer patients. The Institute of Medicine said the government might already have the authority to cover such costs. That prompted a legal review. Administration officials concluded that they had the necessary authority and that the president did not need to wait for Congress.</p>
        <p>Researchers often complain that they cannot find enough patients for clinical research, in part because Medicare reimbursement is uncertain. The White House said that 63 percent of cancer patients were 65 or older, but that the elderly accounted for only 33 percent of the people in clinical trials. Scientists say that higher participation could lead to faster development of effective treatments. Researchers say it often takes three to five years to enroll enough participants in a clinical trial to make the results scientifically valid and statistically meaningful.</p>
        <p>In an interview this evening, Mr.  Gore said: ''Exciting new discoveries are occurring almost weekly. We can't afford that kind of time lag for clinical trials. Speeding up enrollment can accelerate the discovery and use of cost-saving, life-saving new therapies.''</p>
        <p>In a paper explaining the rationale for its new policy, the White House says: ''Too few seniors participate in clinical trials. Current Medicare reimbursement policies often discourage seniors from participating. Coverage of all clinical trials, not just those for cancer, is critically important to ensuring new breakthroughs in diagnostics, treatments and cures for many of the most devastating diseases afflicting millions of Americans of all ages.''</p>
        <p>Researchers have made great progress in treating children with cancer. One reason, they say, is that more than half of pediatric cancer patients are in clinical trials. About 75 percent of cancers in children are now curable, the administration said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton instructed Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, to inform Medicare beneficiaries, doctors, hospitals and other health care providers of the new policy. In addition, the White House ordered federal health officials to track Medicare spending on clinical trials.</p>
        <p>Even after new medical procedures and devices are found to be safe and effective, there is no guarantee that Medicare will cover them. Under the new policy, Medicare officials and the National Institutes of Health will help researchers design clinical trials so they produce the information needed for decisions about coverage.</p>
