        <p>J. P. Morgan agreed to pay a $200,000 fine yesterday after regulators found that the firm had repeatedly violated rules requiring that customer limit orders be displayed to the market.</p>
        <p>N.A.S.D. Regulation, the regulatory arm of the National Association of Securities Dealers, said that the fine was by far the largest ever levied for violation of those rules, which require that customer orders be displayed to the entire market if they are at prices equal to or better than prices available elsewhere in the market at the time.</p>
        <p>After the problem was discovered, in 1998, the firm put in an automatic compliance system, regulators said, but it was immediately disconnected by Morgan's head Nasdaq trader. A Morgan spokesman declined to say why it had been turned off, but Morgan officials have told regulators the trader believed the system was not working correctly. It remained off for five months.</p>
        <p>Neither the N.A.S.D. nor a Morgan spokesman would identify the trader. N.A.S.D. officials refused to say whether disciplinary action against the trader was planned. The trader still works for Morgan, although not in the same position, the official said.</p>
        <p>Limit orders are orders to buy or sell a stock at a certain price, if that price is available. The rules require that such orders be either filled or immediately displayed if they are equal to or better than the best price then being offered by the market maker that receives the order.</p>
        <p>In several cases, N.A.S.D. Regulation said, Morgan failed to execute a limit order while trading at the same price for its own account. That gave the firm profit opportunities that should have gone to customers.</p>
        <p>A Morgan spokesman said that the firm ''recognized there was a problem'' and ''cooperated with the N.A.S.D. and our vendor to address it.'' In a statement to N.A.S.D. Regulation, the firm attributed the problem in part to the supplier of a computer system that Morgan uses.</p>
        <p>Paul Wilson, a spokesman for that supplier, SunGard Data Systems, said its system had been successfully used by many other firms and that Morgan had not approached it for help in solving the problems until March. Until then, he said, Morgan ''chose not to use some of the functionality'' of SunGard's system, or to arrange for training for its personnel. A Morgan spokesman disputed that, saying it began complaining a year earlier, in March 1999.</p>
        <p>Last month the Securities and Exchange Commission released a report indicating that the rules were frequently violated by many brokerage firms and stock exchanges.</p>
        <p>''Compliance is terrible,'' Lori Richards, the commission's director of compliance inspections and examinations, said then, noting that one brokerage firm, which was not identified, had violated the rules on  92 percent of the limit orders examined in an S.E.C. review.</p>
        <p>The limit order rules have been in effect since 1997, but it appears neither the N.A.S.D. nor many brokerage firms had systems to ensure they were followed. Stephen Luparello, an executive vice president of N.A.S.D. Regulation, said a new automated system had been put in place by the N.A.S.D. last week to assess compliance. The first data from that system is now being reviewed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Luparello said it would be wrong to conclude that enforcing the limit order rules had not been a high priority, however. ''It has always been one of the most important things to us,'' he said, adding that more than 50 such cases had been brought, with the largest fine before the Morgan case being $20,000 against GKN Securities.</p>
        <p>At Morgan, internal compliance personnel performed few checks until July 1998, the firm said in a submission to the N.A.S.D., because compliance officials could not get the information electronically. But in March 1998, N.A.S.D. examiners uncovered violations in spot checks.</p>
        <p>The new system was installed in September 1998 but was turned off almost immediately, a fact that was not noticed because the internal staff made no checks. It was discovered by compliance personnel the next February as they prepared for the next N.A.S.D. review, Morgan said. That discovery set off the N.A.S.D. inquiry that led to yesterday's fine.</p>
        <p>In Morgan's last N.A.S.D. review, in December 1999, the association said it still found examples of improperly handled limit orders, including cases of the firm trading ahead of its customers. The N.A.S.D. did not cite it for improper supervision then, but did after its inspections in 1998 and February 1999.</p>
