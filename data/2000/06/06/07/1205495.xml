        <p>In the first major advertising offensive of the general election, the Democratic Party said it would begin a 10-week, $25 million television campaign this week that would ''redefine'' Vice President Al Gore and emphasize the credit he deserved for the nation's successes in the past seven years.</p>
        <p>In announcing plans to use the soft-money contributions to help cover the cost of the commercials, Democratic officials are breaking with Mr. Gore's own proposal to ban the use of unrestricted soft money on advertising.</p>
        <p>The advertisements will initially run in 15 states, including the electoral-vote-rich swing states of Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin. One of the first commercials, which will be  unveiled at a news conference today in Washington, will focus on health care, officials said.</p>
        <p>Edward G. Rendell, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said Mr. Gore's proposal to ban soft money in issue advertising, made to Gov. George W. Bush in an e-mail message on March 14, was moot because Mr. Bush had rejected the idea.</p>
        <p>''It was a challenge that was never accepted,'' Mr. Rendell said. ''The only time a challenge becomes binding is when the other side accepts the challenge.''</p>
        <p>The commercials come at a time when Mr. Bush has been running ahead of Mr. Gore in some polls. In recent weeks some Democrats have become concerned about how deftly Mr. Bush has been able to dictate the agenda and tone of the campaign through a series of policy initiatives on everything from literacy to missile defense.</p>
        <p>The advertising blitz also occurs amid a furious back-and-forth between Republicans and Democrats over whether Mr. Gore is reneging on his proposal to ban commercials paid for with soft money. The term applies to the unrestricted contributions made to the parties by unions, corporations and individuals that have come under attack from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and other supporters of campaign finance reform.</p>
        <p>Democrats insisted the decision to run the commercials was not the result of panic over Mr. Bush's strong showing in the polls, but rather part of a long-term strategy. The action, said an official who demanded anonymity, ''reflects how much money you have and how many states you need to buy.''</p>
        <p>''These things were discussed three weeks ago, four weeks ago,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>Republican strategists said the Democratic National Committee had  also bought television time beginning tomorrow in Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington.</p>
        <p>Under Federal Election Commission guidelines, the national parties can finance issue advertisements with 65 percent hard, or federal, money and 35 percent soft money. What makes these particular commercials significant is Mr. Gore's challenge to Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''I challenge you to accept my proposal that we both reject the use of soft money to run issue ads,'' Mr. Gore wrote. ''I will take the first step by requesting the Democratic National Committee not to run any issue ads paid for by soft money unless and until the Republican Party uses money for advertising.</p>
        <p>''This agreement,'' he continued, ''would also cover loopholes which other organizations and individuals, like the Republican Leadership Council and the Wyly brothers, have used to raise and spend unlimited soft money to run issue ads without any disclosure of donors.''</p>
        <p>By opting to be the first to use the commercials, Mr. Gore is running the risk of looking as if he was never serious about campaign finance reform. And Mr. Bush and other Republicans tried to reinforce that impression yesterday.</p>
        <p>''You think he was serious about saying that they are not going to spend soft money?'' Mr. Bush asked at a news conference in Augusta, Ga. ''Of course they are; this is a guy that said he's for campaign funding reform in the hopes that we forget that he went to a Buddhist temple to raise money.''</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign has tried to portray Mr. Gore's offer as a promise. ''If Al Gore breaks his word by airing these ads, it's another reminder that the vice president does not hold any convictions that can't easily be changed,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rendell and other Democrats have taken pains to emphasize that the offer was a challenge, not a promise. They added that the Republicans violated the spirit of the overture almost immediately, with commercials by obscure special interest groups in California and the District of Columbia that attacked Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>One group, Shape the Debate, formed by associates of Pete Wilson, the former governor and a Republican, ran a $1.5 million campaign in California in which Mr. Gore was mocked in a pseudo game show called Hypocrisy.</p>
        <p>''If there is anyone at the R.N.C. who believes that Governor Wilson would have done this without checking with the Bush campaign,'' Mr. Rendell and Joe Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, wrote in a letter yesterday to the Republican National Committee, ''please give me their names; we have a bridge in Brooklyn we want to sell them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rendell said other states would be added over the 10 weeks.</p>
        <p>''Gore doesn't seem to be getting the credit he deserves,'' Mr. Rendell said. ''We're going to try to remind people of the contrast between then and now, and that it's not an accident, it's the result of deliberate action.''</p>
        <p>Later commercials will concentrate on Mr. Bush's record.</p>
        <p>Republicans would not say how they would respond, but added that it was unlikely that they would wait long to do so.</p>
