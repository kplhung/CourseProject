        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he had ordered the police to review safety procedures on subway platforms after a rash of attempts to push people onto the tracks.</p>
        <p>The mayor announced the study two days after a 36-year-old homeless man, Julio DeJesus, was charged with attempted murder in the ninth subway pushing or pushing attempt this year. The police said he tried to push a woman onto the tracks at the 110th Street station of the B and C lines in Manhattan on Sunday, but a bystander intervened.</p>
        <p>The mayor said his study could lead to changes in station design, including moving warning strips farther from the edge of platforms, using gates to keep riders away until their trains arrived and using surveillance cameras more effectively.</p>
        <p>''We should do more to try to figure out a better way to handle crowds,'' Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference, appearing with Police Commissioner Howard Safir and Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington, a member of the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p>
        <p>The mayor's ideas for improving safety are only recommendations to the M.T.A. and its subsidiary for the subway system, New York City Transit, which have independent authority over the stations.</p>
        <p>Al O'Leary, a New York City Transit spokesman, said that the agency shared the mayor's goal of making the subways as safe as possible, but that some of the mayor's ideas had already been considered and rejected, particularly his suggestion of using gates on crowded platforms.</p>
        <p>The mayor said such gates or barriers, which are used in the newer subway systems in some other cities, might keep people a safe distance from subway tracks. The gates could be synchronized with the timing of trains, and open when they arrive. But Mr. Giuliani acknowledged problems because of the age of the city subways, in which hand-operated, century-old control systems are incapable of stopping trains at the same position in each station each time they pull in.</p>
        <p>''Barriers, guard rails and enclosures are simply not practical,'' Mr. O'Leary said.</p>
        <p>In a separate interview, Mr. Safir said the police would contact other cities to see how they handled subway station safety. He said the review had been prompted by the number of pushings or attempts on subway platforms. This year's total already equals that for all of 1999. In the nine subway pushings or attempts this year, the police have arrested five people, Mr. Safir said. In two of those nine, the victims were also robbed, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir said one idea was to install motion detector surveillance cameras that would monitor anything that fell onto the tracks, and signal any approaching train to halt.</p>
