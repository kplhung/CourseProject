        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>A PLEDGE FOR VETERANS -- Gov. George W. Bush used a D-Day celebration yesterday to make a promise to the nation's veterans, especially those of World War II. If he is elected president, he said, he will revamp the ''bureaucratic'' Department of Veterans Affairs and push through improvements in Social Security to preserve benefits for ''our greatest generation.'' ''A grateful nation keeps faith with the old soldier,'' Mr. Bush said in Augusta, Ga., on the 56th anniversary of the Normandy landing. ''Too often in Washington those who served in the military are remembered only on Veterans Day.'' He  said that this week, he would recommend changes in how Veterans Affairs operates. He also called Social Security a solemn commitment to the World War II generation and accused Vice President Al Gore of using ''scare tactics'' in criticizing his plans. With the retirement of the baby boom generation threatening the solvency of Social Security, Mr. Bush has called for part of the payroll tax of younger workers to be diverted to individual accounts that could be invested in the market. Yesterday in Washington, opponents of such a plan released a study saying that creating such accounts would require deep cuts in the guaranteed Social Security benefit.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>WHAT OPPONENT? -- Al Gore might be understandably obsessed with George W. Bush, given that the two men are battling for the big prize. But these days, the vice president is not even mentioning the Texas governor's name. In fact, the name ''Bush'' has not passed Mr. Gore's lips since May 26, at least in public. Yesterday, during an interview with WSEE-TV, the CBS affiliate in Erie, Pa., Mr. Gore was asked what he thought of Tom Ridge, the Pennsylvania governor and much-rumored running mate for Mr. Bush. ''I'm certainly not going to get involved in speculating on what the other side might do,'' he said. Later, in an interview with WIFR-TV, the CBS affiliate in Rockford, Ill., he was asked about debating Mr. Bush at the site of one of the Lincoln-Douglas debates. Mr. Gore accepted and added: ''I hope you can convince the other fellow.'' Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's press secretary, says that Mr. Bush's name will no doubt recur in the future, but for now, he says, Mr. Gore will appear to be in this race all by himself, ''to guarantee that the focus stays where it should be -- on Al Gore and his agenda.''</p>

        <p>A VOTE FOR GORE -- Former Senator Bill Bradley, who largely dropped out of sight after ending his quest for the Democratic presidential nomination on March 9, resurfaced yesterday at his polling place in Montclair, N.J., to cast a primary ballot for his old rival, Al Gore. When he left the race, Mr. Bradley said he would support Mr. Gore, but when reporters pressed him about whether that was an endorsement, he replied, somewhat enigmatically, ''It's your call.'' That response prompted the Republican National Committee to keep a running count of the number of days ''since Bill Bradley refused to endorse Gore.'' Yesterday, Mr. Bradley faced the endorsement question again. ''I said I'd give him my full support, and that's what I will do,'' he told The Associated Press, adding that he intended to campaign in coming months for Democratic candidates. Including Mr. Gore? ''Uh, that's . . . sure, yeah, by all means,'' he replied. Might there be a need for another statement of his support for Mr. Gore? ''I don't think so,'' Mr. Bradley replied.</p>

        <p>THE PRIMARIES</p>
        <p>TEN COMMANDMENTS JUDGE WINS -- The Alabama judge who fought to keep the Ten Commandments displayed in his courtroom, Etowah County Circuit Judge Roy Moore, won the Republican primary yesterday for chief justice of the state Supreme Court. In Montana, Brian Schweitzer, a farmer who made high prices for prescription drugs a battle cry, easily beat his opponent, John Driscoll, in the Democratic primary for Senate and will face Senator Conrad Burns, a two-term Republican.</p>
