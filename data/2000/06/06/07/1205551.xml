        <p>''When we're launching shows like 'Dragon Tales,' people don't realize it's brought to you by the same people who brought you 'Sesame Street,' '' said Sherrie Rollins Westin, executive vice president for marketing at the workshop. ''What we found was people don't know what C.T.W. is.''</p>
