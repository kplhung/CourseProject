        <p>WHEN the Ford Motor Company chose to buy tires in one of the first transactions on its business-to-business Internet exchange site recently, no one was surprised. Of all the products that can be traded in such exchanges, the humble automobile tire, a circular piece of rubber compound with a tread, is near the top of many lists.</p>
        <p>That would seem to be bad news for tire manufacturers. The conventional wisdom is that sellers of commodities on Internet exchanges will see their prices beaten down and their profit margins destroyed.</p>
        <p>The so-called reverse auctions that the exchanges make possible, in which sellers post lower and lower prices for their goods on a Web site to secure a contract, are intended to save money mainly for the buyer. And General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler are combining their exchanges into a single, giant enterprise to handle as much as possible of their $250 billion a year in purchasing.</p>
        <p>So, are executives at Continental A.G., a big multinational tire maker, concerned about this, even alarmed? They say they are not even worried. The reasons for their nonchalance say much about both the potential and the limitations of business-to-business commerce, in the auto industry and beyond.</p>
        <p>Continental, which makes Continental, Uniroyal and General tires, and other tire manufacturers are confident that the technologically more advanced tires they are developing will interact with cars' brake systems in such complicated ways that tires will cease to be commodities. At the same time, Continental has turned itself into one of the world's largest brake makers, and is designing more sophisticated brake and chassis suspension systems that will also be hard to buy or sell based on a single price or a set of specifications on a Web site.</p>
        <p>Continental's executives are convinced -- and a growing number of Internet experts agree -- that most of their products will soon be too complex to be exposed to the brutal price pressures of Web auctions. ''In the engineered products, I don't see the reverse auction coming at all,'' said Stephan Kessel, the chairman of Continental's executive board.</p>
        <p>Experts say that Continental's experience may be repeated in many other industries, including airlines, railroads, utilities and semiconductors. Corporate buyers of everything from computerized brake systems to aircraft need to work very closely with their vendors' engineers to customize the products. There is usually only a handful of suppliers of highly engineered products, so a Web auction is unlikely to draw in new bidders with lower cost structures. And many products require so much service and parts after a sale that buyers must negotiate extremely detailed contracts to protect themselves against being gouged later for necessary spare parts.</p>
        <p>''If you have a Gateway laptop computer and you want to buy a power cord to use it on a plane, you have to buy the cord from Gateway,'' said Jonathan Yaron, the chief executive and co-founder of Enigma Inc., an e-commerce software maker in Burlington, Mass. ''Why will Gateway participate in any exchange for power cords? They won't.''</p>
        <p>Add up the products that are not appropriate for Internet auctions and the opportunity for such exchanges is limited, Mr. Yaron said. ''The exchanges have a place in the market, but it's a 20 percent place, not a 90 percent place, as people wanted to think six months ago.''</p>
        <p>The auto industry dwarfs the computer and software industries in sales and share of the nation's economic output, so efforts to put the industry's purchasing online have gained particular attention. But the auto industry's best-known expert on purchasing, Thomas T. Stallkamp, tends to agree with Mr. Yaron.</p>
        <p>''The hype on exchanges and auctions and reverse auctions is going to center on a very small volume,'' just 20 percent or so of the automakers' overall purchasing, said Mr. Stallkamp, whose purchasing skills made him president of Chrysler until he was recently pushed out. He is now the chief executive of MSX International, a company in Auburn Hills, Mich., that helps businesses hire engineers.</p>
        <p>At the headquarters of the Big Three automakers' business-to-business exchange, a warren of cubicles in Southfield, a northwest suburb of Detroit, there is a little more optimism about what such exchanges can accomplish. G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler executives there acknowledge that many engineered products are too complicated to be handled by reverse auctions. But Alice A. Miles, the president of Ford's Internet exchange operations, said that 35 percent of purchasing could be handled through online transactions, and that the cost of other transactions could be reduced by limiting paperwork.</p>
        <p>She and the other auto executives are also trying to allay their suppliers' suspicions, by trying to play down Wall Street's initial expectation that the exchange will produce big savings on automakers' payments to suppliers. The automakers say that they want to work with suppliers to find areas of duplicated costs.</p>
        <p>''Rather than think of it as a weapon that's going to be used against you, we want everybody to think of it as an opportunity,'' Ms. Miles said.</p>
        <p>The automakers disagree among themselves on whether tires lend themselves to auctions. G.M. and Ford say they are suitable. But DaimlerChrysler accepts the tire industry's argument that tire features should be worked out in great detail as part of the brake and suspension design, so that online bidding is impractical.</p>
        <p>Peter A. Weiss, DaimlerChrysler's program director for electronic commerce, contended that tires on a Mercedes sedan traveling up to 150 miles an hour on a German autobahn, or even tires on a Dodge Neon on an American highway, must be just right to provide adequate traction and braking. ''This is the piece between you and the road -- it's so important,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Continental presents a particularly good case study of the uses and limits of online exchanges. Based in Hanover, Germany, Continental was a tire maker until it acquired the brake and chassis suspension operations of ITT Automotive in 1998, becoming one of the world's largest makers of antilock brakes. Continental's sales are now evenly divided between tires and brake systems.</p>
        <p>Continental sees benefits to participating in online exchanges. But like so many other companies, it wants to do so as a buyer.</p>
        <p>While rubber prices are already set on commodity exchanges, which are so efficient that Internet exchanges are unlikely to improve upon them, a third of Continental's purchasing costs lies in products that do not even go into tires. This includes everything from factory lubricants to office pencils. Mr. Kessel hopes that Internet exchanges will cut his company's costs 15 percent for these purchases, mainly by reducing the number of employees who handle the paperwork on these transactions.</p>
        <p>Continental is less enthusiastic about selling its wares in the automakers' auctions, although it agrees that current tires are suitable. Continental insists the prices it received for its tires in the Ford auction were no lower than previous transactions, but Ford disagrees, saying it obtained cheaper prices.</p>
        <p>Some rival tire makers have gone farther than Continental in objecting to using auctions for tires at all, contending that carefully crafted brand images will be eroded if they are traded like commodities. They also  question whether tires are commodities at all. ''Tires are a very highly engineered product but they are the Rodney Dangerfields of the vehicle,'' complained Robert J. McNally, the vice president for process improvement and information technology at Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel acknowledged that Continental's tires could be auctioned in the short term, but insisted that the rest of the company's products did not lend themselves to auctions and that even tires would someday be too complicated to be included. For now, he said, ''tires are more into the direction of a commodity business that might be suitable for reverse auctions -- brakes, brake systems and chassis systems will most likely not go through these reverse auctions.''</p>
        <p>CURRENTLY, cars' brake, traction control and electronic stability systems rely on accelerometers and other sensors of the vehicle's movement, along with sensors linked to the vehicle's steel wheels. Sensors do not monitor tires, which would give a more accurate measurement of whether they are maintaining traction on the road.</p>
        <p>But Continental has developed a generation of tires that will address this problem and start appearing on vehicles in two years. The tires will have magnetic stripes baked into the tread; new magnetic sensors in the brake system will monitor these magnetic stripes, engaging the brakes when needed.</p>
        <p>Since these tires will work only with Continental's brake systems, manufacturers will have to buy tires with the brake systems. Continental engineers say they can make the tires and magnetic sensors better and much cheaper than the current sensors, and predict that the new tires will become ubiquitous in a few years.</p>
        <p>Because the magnetic tires will become a big part of one of an automobile's most complicated systems, automakers will be forced to engage in extensive negotiations to buy them, said William Kozyra, the president of Continental's North American brake and chassis operations.</p>
        <p>''So, when it comes to tire auctions on the Internet,'' Mr. Kozyra said, ''I don't envision that's something that can be done long term.''</p>
