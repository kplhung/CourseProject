        <p>It is not remotely related to Woody Stephens's five straight victories in the Belmont Stakes. In fact, it is not even a streak of any size yet. But Scotty Schulhofer is the only trainer who can make it two straight in the Belmont this Saturday, and he took the same rather unconventional route to get there both times. Going back a little farther, he would win the race for the third time in eight years if his 3-year-old colt Postponed turns the trick.</p>
        <p>Schulhofer won the Belmont for the first time in 1993 with Centennial Farm's Colonial Affair. He came back to win it again last year with Jeanne Vance's Lemon Drop Kid. Now, he will saddle Vance's Postponed in the 132nd running of the Belmont, and he will achieve a rarity if he wins: same owner, same trainer, same result, two years in a row.</p>

        <p>It is not remotely related to Woody Stephens's five straight victories in the Belmont Stakes. In fact, it is not even a streak of any size yet. But Scotty Schulhofer is the only trainer who can make it two straight in the Belmont this Saturday, and he took the same rather unconventional route to get there both times. Going back a little farther, he would win the race for the third time in eight years if his 3-year-old colt Postponed turns the trick.</p>
        <p>Schulhofer won the Belmont for the first time in 1993 with Centennial Farm's Colonial Affair. He came back to win it again last year with Jeanne Vance's Lemon Drop Kid. Now, he will saddle Vance's Postponed in the 132nd running of the Belmont, and he will achieve a rarity if he wins: same owner, same trainer, same result, two years in a row.</p>
        <p>Schulhofer, who exudes an old-school flavor at 74 with his down-home manners and silvery hair, stood at Barn 23 yesterday morning at rainy Belmont Park and reported that he was feeling fit after heart surgery during the winter in Florida. Some of the credit, he said, goes to Postponed.</p>
        <p>''He's put a little bounce into me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And well he might. After running fifth in the Florida Derby and sixth in the Wood Memorial, the colt ran second by a neck in an allowance at Aqueduct last month and, three weeks later, won the Peter Pan over Unshaded and Globalize. All three horses will meet again Saturday in the huge vacancy caused by the withdrawal from the Belmont of Fusaichi Pegasus, winner of the Kentucky Derby, and Red Bullet, winner of the Preakness.</p>
        <p>So, with no Triple Crown on the line, Schulhofer acknowledged that Postponed probably had a better shot at winning the Belmont. But he said there was no magical design to the route that Postponed and Lemon Drop Kid had taken to get there: the Peter Pan at a mile and an eighth and, three weeks later, the Belmont at a mile and a half.</p>
        <p>''It's more of a coincidence,'' Schulhofer said. ''Lemon Drop Kid ran ninth in the Kentucky Derby last year. He drew an outside post position, and didn't have a chance. So, we ran him in the Peter Pan and he came back to win the Belmont and the Travers.</p>
        <p>''Postponed also had to overcome some adversity. He still hasn't run in any of the classics. I wanted to run him in an allowance race in Florida this winter, but it didn't fill, so I let him run in the Florida Derby. But he wasn't ready for that level of competition.''</p>
        <p>Postponed finished fifth behind some pretty heavy hitters, led by Hal's Hope and High Yield. One month later, he also struggled in the Wood Memorial, running sixth behind Fusaichi Pegasus, Red Bullet and Aptitude. But that was when he turned the corner.</p>
        <p>With Edgar Prado replacing Jose Santos as his jockey, Postponed missed winning an allowance at Aqueduct by a neck on May 3, then scored big to win the Peter Pan on May 27. The path led directly to the Belmont Stakes.</p>
        <p>''He's primarily a closer, which may help him at a mile and a half,'' Schulhofer said. ''The distance should be no problem. He's a sweet, versatile horse. You can do almost anything with him. In the allowance before the Peter Pan, he ran right off the lead. In the Peter Pan, he closed from ninth place to first.''</p>
        <p>Postponed is a 3-year-old bay son of Summer Squall who was bought by Mrs. Vance and her husband for $835,000 last year at Saratoga. He has raced eight times, won three times and finished second twice. Before he and Lemon Drop Kid became stars, Schulhofer said, the Vances ''paid their dues in this business.''</p>
        <p>Schulhofer, despite his somewhat novel route to the Belmont Stakes, still admits to some regrets for his old friend Neil Drysdale, the trainer of Fusaichi Pegasus, who withdrew from the Belmont after cutting his right front foot in his stall.</p>
        <p>''It's a tough break,'' he said. ''I remember when he came over and went to work for Tartan Farms when John Nerud was there. Neil was just a kid. But he became a fine trainer. He always looks after the horse.''</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>Chief Seattle was withdrawn from the Belmont by Godolphin Stable, but his stablemate Curule will be entered when post positions are assigned today. Curule ran seventh in the Kentucky Derby after winning only one race in Dubai in February. Chief Seattle, second in last year's Champagne and Breeders' Cup Juvenile, has not raced since then. He worked seven furlongs yesterday morning in 1:271/5  with JERRY BAILEY riding. Then the assistant trainer, TOM ALBERTRANI, said: ''The Belmont probably would have been a little hard on him. We'll wait to run him in an allowance, and then the Dwyer at Belmont on July 9.''</p>
