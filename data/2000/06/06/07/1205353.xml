        <p>IT was a grand experiment, if maybe not the clever promotional idea it must have seemed: at a technology conference here attended by a bevy of companies and hundreds of investors, every attendee received a free Internet-equipped Ericsson cellular telephone.</p>
        <p>It was supposed to be a chance for investors to experiment with the new technology, to measure its potency hands on, not to mention spurring the investors to plow money into some of the companies building applications and hardware for the latest generation of handsets.</p>
        <p>But it became clear quite quickly to the people who received the free phones that for all the hype about wireless application protocol, or WAP, ''m-commerce'' and even the buzzword mouthful, B-to-B m-commerce, the technology is still far from ready to attract a mass market.</p>
        <p>''I'm just going to call my secretary and ask her what happened to the market today,'' said a French banker after fitfully pounding the phone's buttons for 10 minutes to check the latest stock figures. ''I can do it in half the time, and it will be significantly less painful.''</p>
        <p>The phones were not a complete bomb, though. Many investors seemed to enjoy the ''gee whiz'' nature of the devices, considering them a precursor of what is to come. And there is a lot on tap, even if it will not become a mass-market reality for years.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's ready for prime time in a long way,'' acknowledged Gareth Hughes, managing director of Psion, the British maker of hand-held devices, which is beginning to develop products based on the wireless protocol. ''As much as I hate to say it, much of what's out there is likely to disappoint the market with the hype that's out there.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Hughes described a science-fiction-like future that he argued is only a year or two away from reality in Europe, where the percentage of people who use mobile phones is much higher than it is in the United States. His company is developing devices for both white-collar and blue-collar work forces that will allow for a variety of transactions and data exchanges. He waxed on about hand-held devices for doctors that will allow them to pull up patients' records in real time with zoomable views of X-rays and other diagrams. He demonstrated a hand-held device that will allow corporate users to log on to a corporate network and make a major stock trade on behalf of institutional clients.</p>
        <p>Right now, he said, BMW sales representatives in Germany use a wireless Psion device that allows them to call up car specifications and other data. The service may be slow now, but as wireless broadband, or high-speed Internet connections over the phone, rolls out -- still at least five years away in Europe, according to most estimates -- car shoppers will be able to look at a BMW catalog on a hand-held device and then design their own cars while driving inside test models. And they will pay by beaming bank details to the salesman, if Mr. Hughes has his way.</p>
        <p>That will just be the beginning. According to Motorola, one of the largest manufacturers of mobile phones, making phone calls on a hand-held device will be only one tiny function. The devices will be used as credit cards, to pay for a meal at a restaurant or groceries at the supermarket.</p>
        <p>The devices will also have a business-to-business angle: workers will be able to buy things with the device using the digital equivalent of a corporate credit card and be able to receive a reimbursement approval almost immediately.</p>
        <p>Michael R. Lynch, the chairman and chief executive of the Autonomy Corporation, an Internet software company, said that mobile devices would go even one step further than the supermarket example. He is working with clients who are developing devices and software that will allow shoppers to scan a product's bar code in a store and immediately display a list of other vendors selling the same product and at what price. ''It will change the whole experience,'' he said. ''It will be even more competitive.''</p>
        <p>Stores and restaurants will be able to alert customers to specials they might be running if they are in the neighborhood, based on the location of the customers' phones. Several companies are even developing systems that would effectively alert people if friends were nearby. A variation on that theme is another product in development that would play matchmaker of sorts by issuing an alert when a possible suitor with similar interests is nearby based on a questionnaire both people would fill out beforehand. The company says that it is aware of the potential perils and that the system will be anonymous, with built-in mechanisms to avoid stalkers.</p>
        <p>Besides making payments for movie or airline tickets, mobile devices will also act as a key to get into homes and offices, a garage door opener and identification device for all sorts of purposes.</p>
        <p>It may all sound fanciful, but it is coming, Mr. Hughes said. ''The next 24 months will be the test,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Robin Saxby, chairman and chief executive of ARM Holdings, one of the leading designers of microprocessors for hand-held devices, still thinks m-commerce -- B-to-B or not -- is still a bit of a pipe dream. ''It will take at least 10 years to get it right,'' he said, making reference to the free phone he received at the conference. ''Come on,'' he added, ''these things just don't work.''</p>
