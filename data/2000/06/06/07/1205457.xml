        <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an inquiry into whether several eBay users, including the Sacramento lawyer who almost sold a colorful abstract painting for $135,805 after putting it up for sale for 25 cents, committed fraud by bidding up the prices of one another's online auction offerings.</p>
        <p>Donald Vilfer, a supervisory special agent in the F.B.I.'s Sacramento office, said the bureau turned its attention to the case after reading a June 2 article in The New York Times. That article outlined how Kenneth A. Walton, the Sacramento lawyer, and several other eBay users had engaged in cross-bidding on one another's items and offered glowing testimonials to each other on the eBay site.

        <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an inquiry into whether several eBay users, including the Sacramento lawyer who almost sold a colorful abstract painting for $135,805 after putting it up for sale for 25 cents, committed fraud by bidding up the prices of one another's online auction offerings.</p>
        <p>Donald Vilfer, a supervisory special agent in the F.B.I.'s Sacramento office, said the bureau turned its attention to the case after reading a June 2 article in The New York Times. That article outlined how Kenneth A. Walton, the Sacramento lawyer, and several other eBay users had engaged in cross-bidding on one another's items and offered glowing testimonials to each other on the eBay site. Mr. Walton has denied operating in concert with others.</p>
        <p>The bureau's office in Sacramento has been watching the episode since last month, when eBay voided the sale and suspended Mr. Walton for bidding on his own painting, whose price had skyrocketed on speculation that it might be by the renowned California artist Richard Diebenkorn. Self-bidding, known as shill bidding, is forbidden by eBay rules and is generally illegal in the traditional auction world.</p>
        <p>Participation in a shill-bidding ring would run afoul of federal statutes prohibiting mail fraud and wire fraud; each count could carry a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison and $1 million in fines.</p>
        <p>F.B.I. headquarters in Washington acknowledged that there have been other allegations of shill-bidding rings online, but agency officials declined to say if any other cases are under investigation.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Walton, who used at least five Internet names to buy and sell on eBay (including golfpoorly, cheesesix, and grecescu), eBay suspended eight Internet names registered to other individuals after investigating bidding patterns in Mr. Walton's and related auctions.</p>
        <p>Last week, after using its proprietary ''shill hunter'' software to review bidding by several additional Internet names at the request of The Times, eBay warned two more users. All told, the company has disciplined 15 Internet names since Mr. Walton's auction.</p>
        <p>Reached by phone, Mr. Walton said he knew nothing about an F.B.I. investigation and had no comment.</p>
        <p>EBay declined to comment on the F.B.I. investigation but said it cooperated fully with law enforcement activities. The company also said that because of Mr. Walton's ''repeated series of shill bids,'' it was making Mr. Walton's suspension, which initially was for 30 days, permanent.</p>
        <p>The opportunity for chicanery and fraud in consumer-based cyberauctions is increasing as their popularity grows. This year alone, the value of merchandise sold through online auctions is expected to more than double to $6.4 billion, up from $3 billion, according to Jupiter Communications. The number of actual complaints, compared with the number of transactions, remains minuscule, but accusations about Internet auctions to the Federal Trade Commission have increased a hundredfold in the last two years, to 10,700 in 1999. The most common involve credit card fraud, merchandise that was paid for but not delivered, and delivery of damaged or shoddy goods that do not live up to their description.</p>
        <p>But law enforcement officials said online auctions were a new medium for other kinds of fraud and thus of growing interest to them.</p>
        <p>Art, antique and collectible offerings are ripe for sales of fakes, for example. In late May, the New York State attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, sued Antique and Design Center of New Windsor, N.Y., accusing it of selling fakes purported to be by well-known artists like Oscar Bluemner, Charles Burchfield and George Luks on eBay.</p>
        <p>And on May 8, the F.B.I. and the National White Collar Crime Center opened an Internet Fraud Complaint Center in Morgantown, W. Va.; since then about 1,000 complaints a week have poured in for all types of Internet fraud. The center (www.ifccfbi.gov) is too new to assess the extent of auction fraud, however.</p>
        <p>The F.B.I. declined to say precisely how its eBay investigation would proceed, but officials said it would undoubtedly involve the same techniques used with other crimes -- interviewing, searching for documents and questioning witnesses before a grand jury.</p>
