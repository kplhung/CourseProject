        <p>Washington and Moscow are the two main protagonists in the current debate about missile defense. But they are not the only ones. Many Europeans fear that American plans to build a limited national shield could unravel the treaty system that restrains the Russian and American nuclear arsenals and thereby unleash a dangerous new arms race.</p>

        <p>Washington and Moscow are the two main protagonists in the current debate about missile defense. But they are not the only ones. Many Europeans fear that American plans to build a limited national shield could unravel the treaty system that restrains the Russian and American nuclear arsenals and thereby unleash a dangerous new arms race.</p>
        <p>Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, moved swiftly this week to fan these European concerns. Just after President Clinton left Moscow on Monday, Mr. Putin was in Rome promoting his new alternative to the American plan, a jointly operated system meant to protect Europe as well as Russia and the United States by intercepting hostile missiles shortly after launch.</p>
        <p>The Russian proposal has yet to be fleshed out in detail and may not prove technologically workable. For now, its main significance is political. Mr. Putin hopes he can play to Europe's chronic uneasiness about American intentions to thwart or delay Washington's proposed missile defense system.</p>
        <p>In some ways, he is falling back on the kind of tactics Moscow used, unsuccessfully, to try to block the stationing of American medium-range missiles in Western Europe two decades ago. That Soviet effort failed, mainly because the military realities of the cold war held America's European NATO partners in line. With Europe no longer threatened by Russian military force, Washington should not count on such reflexive solidarity operating today.</p>
        <p>Any potential that the missile defense issue has for dividing Europe from America would evaporate if Washington and Moscow could agree on amending the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to accommodate a limited American shield. But such agreement has so far proved elusive.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration therefore needs to consult more closely with its European allies on missile defense planning. It should also try to allay the concerns of China, which understandably worries that an American system designed to knock down a handful of North Korean missiles could negate Beijing's small missile force as well.</p>
        <p>North Korea, Iran and Iraq may soon be able to launch nuclear armed missiles against the United States and other distant countries. That serious threat justifies the administration's efforts to develop and test effective defensive systems and to renegotiate existing arms control treaties to permit their use. But no such system should be built until its technology has been reliably proved and its purposes and limits thoroughly discussed with Russia, China and America's main European allies.</p>
