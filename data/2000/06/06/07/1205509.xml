        <p>The two bodies were lying 10 feet apart, with Fred Capps, the state prosecutor revered here as the epitome of rural justice, still gripping his revolver in his left hand, the way he held it at death in defending his home from Eddie Vaughn, the intruder he had known all too well since childhood.</p>

        <p>The two bodies were lying 10 feet apart, with Fred Capps, the state prosecutor revered here as the epitome of rural justice, still gripping his revolver in his left hand, the way he held it at death in defending his home from Eddie Vaughn, the intruder he had known all too well since childhood.</p>
        <p>''Eddie was just a loser, a bully from grade school on,'' said State Senator David L. Williams, mourning his friend, the 46-year-old Mr. Capps, and ruing their childhood antagonist, Mr. Vaughn.</p>
        <p>Armed with a combat assault rifle, Mr. Vaughn barged into Mr. Capps's home at dawn Monday only hours before the two were to face off in court where Mr. Vaughn was to be tried on charges of sexually molesting a child.</p>
        <p>Each man managed to mortally wound the other in an encounter that left this pastoral hamlet stunned that the modern American- Gothic affliction of high-powered gunplay and  assassination could reach this far down a quiet country road, to a town of 1,800 people 150 miles southeast of Louisville.</p>
        <p>''Eddie was the stereotypical person who lived his entire life to do something absurd like this,'' said Senator Williams, exemplifying the bitter sorrow engulfing this gentlest of farm towns -- one of the least violent in Mr. Capps's busy, four-county portfolio of prosecuting crimes big and small.</p>
        <p>At Keith's Barbershop, across from the stone courthouse where justice was to have been dealt to Mr. Vaughn, men grieved the slaying of a pillar of the community as fresh details emerged from the police.</p>
        <p>In an amiable spot favored each morning by Mr. Capps for coffee and socializing, they talked of his sudden end in the horrendous shootout initiated by someone they described as a long-troubled ''bad apple'' out on a desperate, lethal mission.</p>
        <p>The only scrap of comfort for the many friends of Mr. Capp was that he was able to take up his handgun, a .357 Magnum, and defend his family after the first blast of assault-weapon rounds blew the lock off his front door while the Cappses and their two children were in bed.</p>
        <p>''Vaughn came in with a banana clip in that rifle holding 30 or 50 rounds,'' said Keith Riddle, the barber who is a city councilman. As a close friend and companion of Mr. Capps in the light-weapon sport of rabbit hunting, Mr. Riddle shook his head at the specter of such an outsized weapon of war, such a city drug dealer's gun, being brandished in the peaceful hills of this Cumberland River farming region. ''Fred was a good shot, and if he hadn't gotten those two shots off at Vaughn, Fred's family would have been killed, too.''</p>
        <p>In less than an hour, with both men lying dead, the Cappses' handsome brick residence was encircled in yellow crime-scene tape, the grim bunting of far-off melodrama. The door was blown off. The interior was pocked and splintered from the gun battle.</p>
        <p>While forensic workers went through the house, Catherine Capps, an assistant state prosecutor herself, left the scene, a widow bearing bloody scratches from debris of the gun battle that friends say she witnessed. She was accompanied by her two children, John, 16, a star pitcher on the high school baseball team, and Lydia, 11, a devotee of Little League baseball, like her father and brother.</p>
        <p>''I saw Lydia shagging fly balls from her father Sunday evening, the last time I saw Fred, batting them out,'' said Burkesville's mayor, Mike Irby, a retired schoolteacher. He taught Mr. Capps and Senator Williams, who were in the Cumberland County High School class of '71. ''Fred was a good person long before something bad happened to him,'' said the mayor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vaughn, who was 49, had a police record of relatively minor but chronic offenses until the sexual abuse indictment left him facing, if convicted, a long prison term. The police were not divulging any details.</p>
        <p>''It seemed one of those things where someone like Eddie watches the success of someone like Fred across the years and finally resents having to face authority in the form of a person he has known since childhood,'' said Senator Williams, angry and baffled as he sought to comfort constituents around the courthouse.</p>
        <p>''Vaughn was just a troubled, dangerous person,'' concluded Senator Williams, who for an instant wondered if the big city had a certain sanctuary not available here.</p>
        <p>''In a small town, people know where a prosecutor lives, know his routine, when he picks up his kids,'' he said. ''We don't have the anonymity of New York City.''</p>
        <p>Donna Thurman-Knight, the county judge-executive, underlined the ''devastating'' injustice in the killing of a beloved prosecutor by an accused. ''He had devoted his life to ridding us of these type of people,'' Ms. Thurman-Knight said.</p>
        <p>The community was shattered at the loss of a man born and bred here who happily served as a figure of circuit justice so long as he could return home each day as the town's most devoted manager of the Little League. He built it into a five-field, 300-player operation and even imported red Alabama clay as a major-league touch for the infields.</p>
        <p>''My 10-year-old, Cody, was told Fred was gone, and he asked, 'Who's going to teach me to pitch the ball?' '' Vickie Pruitt, the town clerk, said as she grieved for Mr. Capps. ''We'll go on with broken hearts for a long time.''</p>
        <p>The prosecutor, having defeated his old friend Senator Williams in the 1994 Republican primary, was completing a 6-year term as commonwealth attorney and heading unopposed this fall for re-election, with a likely judgeship on the horizon. At the courthouse, he wore his lawyer suits on case days when his demeanor was that of a well-prepared, smartly aggressive prosecutor, associates said. But other days, he would come by in dungarees for a friendly chat, ''with a dip of Skoal and a spit cup,'' recalled Tommy D. Young, a tax assessor.</p>
        <p>''We both knew Vaughn as kids,'' said Senator Williams, who recalled that Mr. Capps occasionally talked of danger from vengeful defendants, but never in his home county, Cumberland, only in the other three, Adair, Casey and Monroe.</p>
        <p>''There's always this talk about, 'What kind of a society are we?' '' said the senator, tired of the question and its familiar answer. ''Well, we're talking about a sociopath, a dangerous person who lost it and did his atrocity, did his assassination. And now there's no replacing Fred.''</p>
