        <p>LIFE science is a flourishing business on the Web. But the demands of scientists have made it an increasingly complicated business.</p>
        <p>Scientists have long been at home on the Internet, which over the last 20 years has quickened the pace at which they share research and information.</p>
        <p>So Internet companies that want to cater to scientists are having no trouble finding potential customers for their Web sites, which offer everything from test tubes and chemicals to custom-made DNA sequences and the latest genetic discoveries.</p>
        <p>Last year, the market for scientific products was about $12 billion in North America and $36 billion worldwide, industry analysts say. Sales are expected to grow about 5 percent a year overall and more than 10 percent a year in life-sciences research, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. E-commerce has captured only a small fraction of the market.</p>
        <p>Companies trying to take advantage of the e-commerce opportunities in life science are finding themselves pressed into offering more complex and difficult services.</p>
        <p>Although the situation is familiar on the Internet, it has been made more challenging by the levels of competition, the demands of customers and the increasing complexity of the information available.</p>
        <p>According to an online survey conducted last year by BioInformatics Inc., only 38 percent of scientists had bought life-science products online, while 80 percent shopped online for personal items.</p>
        <p>But the number of scientists buying laboratory equipment on the Web is growing rapidly. Sales at Fisher Scientific International's site, www.fishersci.com, an industry leader, rose to $55 million in 1999 from $3 million in 1998 and are expected to top $100 million this year.</p>
        <p>When Dr. Wayne Litaker, a molecular ecologist at the University of North Carolina, needed to set up a laboratory to study toxic tides along the Atlantic coast late last year, he turned to the Internet.</p>
        <p>In the past, Dr. Litaker said, finding such materials would require searching catalogs  and writing at least six purchase orders. This time, he logged on to SciQuest.com, and, with one order, spent almost $30,000 to  outfit a laboratory in Beaufort, N.C.</p>
        <p>''We can go there and find most of what we need,'' he said. ''And it saves time.''</p>
        <p>That has been the real attraction.</p>
        <p>Jay Murphy, a Ph.D. candidate in molecular biology at Harvard University, is equally grateful for the time-saving element. Mr. Murphy shuttles between the fruit flies he is studying and the Web, where he can compare his findings with the entire genome of the Drosophila species.</p>
        <p>Ordering a special chemical for precisely cutting up sections of fly DNA used to take 45 minutes to an hour, Mr. Murphy said, ''but on the Internet you can do the same process in less than 15 minutes.''</p>
        <p>And if he orders before 11 a.m., New England Biolabs delivers the enzymes the same day. Mr. Murphy can also download the specifications for each enzyme and instructions on how to use it in experiments.</p>
        <p>Scientists must have highly specialized information about the products they use, said Neil de Crescenzo, the president of Chemdex, a subsidiary of Ventro, a company that operates specialized online technical marketplaces.</p>
        <p>''It's not the same thing to buy a monoclonal antibody as it is to buy a book,'' Mr. de Crescenzo said. So companies are evolving from Web-based marketplaces to locations offering more and more complicated information and computer tools needed by researchers. This way, they can not only conduct experiments but also manage chemical inventories and inventions.</p>
        <p>''It's a straightforward ambition,'' Mr. de Crescenzo said, ''but not straightforward to implement.''</p>
        <p>William Kelly, the president of BioInformatics Inc., in Bethesda, Md., which conducts online surveys of how scientists use the Web, said, ''It's an indication of where the Web is going.''</p>
        <p>Not long ago, Mr. Kelly noted, scientists were content with Web portals that provided journal articles, a primary source for keeping up in their fields. Now, he said, they want access to databases and the ability to manage the online information.</p>
        <p>DoubleTwist.com is a portal that seeks to capitalize on the need for such computer tools in the field of the human genome. While the Human Genome Project and Celera Genomics are racing to decode the entire sequence of human DNA, DoubleTwist aims to make information user-friendly for scientists.</p>
        <p>Researchers can type a gene sequence -- a string of the genetic letters A, T, C and G -- into the site's search engine. The site will find what information exists about the gene and its function and whether anyone holds a patent on the gene. It will also provide links to companies offering specialized products related to the research.</p>
        <p>DoubleTwist evolved from Pangea Systems, a company that created software for pharmaceutical researchers to manage bioinformatics, the field where biology meets information technology. It became a dot-com to attract scientists who use genetic information but cannot afford their own massive computer systems.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of information, but it's fragmented and hard to get at,'' said Robert Williamson, the chief operating officer of DoubleTwist. ''This is geared to a user who doesn't want to understand all the systems and become a computer science major.''</p>
        <p>DoubleTwist planned to charge researchers $10,000 a year for access, but to attract users, it has been offering free searches.</p>
        <p>''I don't think free genome sequences will monetize banner ads,'' said Eric Brown, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
        <p>But the value of the information, Mr. Brown said, has a strong time element, which explains why so many genomics companies are rushing into e-commerce. They want to market proprietary information while it still has value, before it all becomes public, and attract users who will stay with their sites as the information expands to proteins and other machinery of life.</p>
        <p>Until recently, Incyte Genomics made its database of human genes available only to pharmaceutical companies that paid millions of dollars for the information. Now, Incyte is trying to reach a broader market of researchers by offering a gene-by-gene search for $3,000 to $20,000. The price depends on how much information a researcher wants, whether it is for academic research or for profit and whether it is just  information or an actual clone of the gene.</p>
        <p>''They can click and we can send a clone overnight,'' said Dr. Roy Whitfield, Incyte's chief executive.</p>
        <p>To bring this information to the Web requires tremendous computer muscle. ''The human genome is three billion letters long,'' Dr. Whitfield said. ''It's a huge computing task.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Laura Stuve supervises scientists searching for human genes at Incyte's laboratories in Palo Alto, Calif. Her laboratory buys custom-made DNA strands from other companies. Scientists use those strands like hooks to fish for human genes in test tubes, Dr. Stuve said.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, scientists at Incyte wrote out the long strings of DNA letters by hand and faxed them to companies that constructed synthetic DNA, or oligonucleotides. Now they send thousands at a time via e-mail messages, she said.</p>
        <p>''You couldn't do thousands at a time by hand,'' Dr. Stuve said. ''The advantage of doing it all electronically is you already have a file of the DNA sequences and you can transfer it over the Internet.''</p>
