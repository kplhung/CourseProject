        <p>STEINWAY STREET between 25th and 28th Avenues in Astoria, Queens, does not look, or smell, like a New York street. On warm evenings the air is flavored with sweet tobacco, as men, young and old, gather outside Middle Eastern cafes to smoke hookahs and drink tiny cups of thick coffee. Long robes and kaffiyehs are as common as Western dress. But perhaps the most unusual sight is the entrance to Mombar, a small Egyptian restaurant that opened about a month ago.</p>
        <p>There's no sign for Mombar (pronounced MOOM-bar), just a couple of huge eyes built into the storefront, one made of stucco, the other of tile shards. A door forms a sort of nose between the eyes, and what you see on entering is not so much a restaurant as a work of art.</p>

        <p>STEINWAY STREET between 25th and 28th Avenues in Astoria, Queens, does not look, or smell, like a New York street. On warm evenings the air is flavored with sweet tobacco, as men, young and old, gather outside Middle Eastern cafes to smoke hookahs and drink tiny cups of thick coffee. Long robes and kaffiyehs are as common as Western dress. But perhaps the most unusual sight is the entrance to Mombar, a small Egyptian restaurant that opened about a month ago.</p>
        <p>There's no sign for Mombar (pronounced MOOM-bar), just a couple of huge eyes built into the storefront, one made of stucco, the other of tile shards. A door forms a sort of nose between the eyes, and what you see on entering is not so much a restaurant as a work of art.</p>
        <p>From the elaborate mosaic floor to the windows of stained glass and the old office postal chutes on the wall that have been transformed into tinted lights, every surface is covered with the creations of Moustafa El Sayed, the owner, chef and resident artist. Tile designs adorn the walls, eyes pop up everywhere and five chandeliers hang from the ceiling, each made from different materials, including the necks of wine bottles. Each tabletop is different and beautiful, one with an inlaid design of old buttons, another with a surreal outstretched hand tattooed with flowers, eyes, fish and less discernible creatures. Bottle bottoms decorate one table.</p>
        <p>''You think he throws the bottoms away?'' asked Fakia Haddad, Mr. Sayed's aide-de-camp, gesturing at the bottleneck chandelier.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sayed and Ms. Haddad make a warm and charming team; she offers guided tours of his creations as he busies himself serenely among the two burners and the oven in his small kitchen. Occasionally, another man bursts in, Mr. Sayed's brother, Ali, who owns Kabab Cafe, an excellent Egyptian restaurant up the block, showing off Moustafa's place to a customer or just coming to kibitz.</p>
        <p>Mombar has no menus; Ms. Haddad simply recites the choices. They almost always include the restaurant's namesake, mombar, a house-made Egyptian sausage of lamb, beef and rice with dill and garlic, served warm with chickpeas. (A vegetarian version is also served.) The other choice for starters is usually a mixture of cold spreads like lemony hummus, baba ghanouj, refreshing tomato salad or excellent foul (pronounced fool), the Egyptian bean salad. These are usually served with crisp bread chips, apple or pear slices, hard Egyptian feta cheese and, on weekends, Mr. Sayed's superb wheat bread.</p>
        <p>Mombar's pricing is a bit vague. The mombar dish is usually $7, but I've been charged both $12 and $15 for the cold appetizer mix. Main courses are all $18, which may seem expensive, but portions are huge. Each is cooked slowly and individually, so Mombar is not a place to go if you're trying to catch a movie.</p>
        <p>With food, too, Mr. Sayed is an artist: he serves personal interpretations of dishes and seems as if he's cooking at home. He blends the ingredients of his delicious couscous, concealing the semolina grains under tender lamb, zucchini, olives, raisins and dried cherries, rather than serving the components separately, North African style. Chicken tagine is a moist and smoky North African stew with olives and vegetables, while rabbit cooked in a clay pot is a hearty southern Egyptian blend, with zucchini, dried apricots, raisins, pine nuts and caramelized cauliflower. Striped bass is cooked perfectly and served simply, with herbs and olive oil, while a half duck is lacquered with molasses and roasted until nutty and black. The duck is delicious, sweet and juicy, though it's a struggle to cut apart.</p>
        <p>Mombar usually has several house-made desserts ($5 each), like baklava dripping with honey. My favorite is the couscous cake, the grains compressed with prunes and dried apricots, luscious with strawberries and sour cream.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sayed says he labored for seven years creating his dining room, which is a long time when you think that Michelangelo completed the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in only four. But Mr. Sayed is probably a better cook.</p>
