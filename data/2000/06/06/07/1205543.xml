        <p>There have been many crossroads in Jason Grimsley's 16-year career, many wrong turns because of the chronic wildness that made him a high risk every time he took the mound. But he is sure his career veered last Oct. 26, in Game 3 of the World Series.</p>
        <p>He got seven outs and allowed no runs, and if not for his performance that night, Grimsley does not know if he would still be with the Yankees. He is not sure if Manager Joe Torre would have confidence in him. But he got those seven outs and his importance to the Yankees' pitching staff is increasing. Torre turned to Grimsley again tonight, for his third emergency start of the season, and for the third time, the Yankees won, whipping Montreal, 8-1.</p>
        <p>Grimsley (2-1) allowed three hits and a run in five innings, but the Yankees' lead was only 2-1 after seven innings. Tino Martinez opened the eighth with a homer, and with two outs and one man on base, reliever Mike Stanton pulled a single through the right side of the infield, his first hit in more than six years; Stanton has a .500 career average (7 for 14).</p>
        <p>Montreal pitchers issued three consecutive walks and Bernie Williams slammed a three-run double -- he had hit a home run earlier -- to blow open the game. Stanton followed Grimsley with two and two-thirds innings of hitless relief. ''Batman and Robin,'' Torre mused later.</p>
        <p>Surrounded by family members, Grimsley camped on a sofa in Cleveland, Tex., a month after the World Series last fall and watched a replay of Game 3, start to finish. There was Andy Pettitte getting knocked around by the Atlanta Braves, 10 hits in three and two-thirds innings, there was Torre going to the mound, pointing a finger at the bullpen and calling for Grimsley. Until that moment, it had appeared Grimsley would not pitch in the postseason.</p>
        <p>Grimsley had pitched well early in the '99 season, but was overcome for two months by the control problems that have affected most of his career. Grimsley rebounded in September, but too late. He was left off the roster in the first two rounds of the postseason, arguing with Torre about the decision near the batting cage at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Hideki Irabu was hit hard by Boston in the playoffs, however, and before the World Series, Grimsley replaced Irabu on the roster, to be summoned in Game 3. He was more nervous watching the replay in his home, Grimsley said recently, than he felt during that game. He was flinching and moving on his couch, suggestions flashing through his mind about a game played weeks before.</p>
        <p>When Torre approached him after the sixth that night and told him he was through, Grimsley felt he could breathe again. What he has come to believe is that that night changed the way he is perceived.</p>
        <p>''There's no question,'' Torre said. ''Any time someone performs for me in the postseason -- probably because I never got there as a player -- I hold that in high esteem. Because if you can do it there, you can always be trusted.''</p>
        <p>And Torre is trusting him more and more. Grimsley has pitched in 21 games this season, usually in the middle innings, and he went into last night's game with a 2.43 earned run average, with just 8 walks in 37 innings. After pitching poorly last Saturday and earning Torre's ire, Grimsley rebounded to throw a scoreless inning Sunday, greatly impressing his manager. Grimsley is a tough guy, Torre told reporters.</p>
        <p>He turned to Grimsley again tonight. The right-hander felt slightly fatigued warming up, having pitched two of the last three days, and he reminded himself to ''back off a little bit'' with his fastball.</p>
        <p>''I just knew I couldn't throw as hard as I do out of the bullpen,'' he said. ''I just wanted to stay back and let the fastball sink. The more groundballs I get, the more success I'm going to have.''</p>
        <p>Grimsley, who made his first career start here for Philadelphia in 1989, walked two of the first three batters he faced, but got out of the jam by enticing Vladimir Guerrero to hit into a fielder's choice and Geoff Blum to fly out to center, and he was never really in trouble in his last four innings. ''Jason is by far the bullpen M.V.P.,'' Stanton said.</p>
        <p>Grimsley's development could be crucial to decisions made by the Yankees (31-23) in the next seven weeks. They have been reluctant to trade Ramiro Mendoza for the last couple of seasons because of his versatility, his experience, his postseason success. But it appears more and more likely they will try to add a veteran hitter before the July 31 trade deadline, and other teams say the Yankees seem more willing to discuss swapping Mendoza. The emergence of Grimsley on the staff makes that easier to do. He is trusted now, making a right turn at that last crossroads.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>CHUCK KNOBLAUCH might play later this week. He also might go on the disabled list. That is the unpredictable nature of the bruised forearm that continues to confound Knoblauch and the Yankees. Knoblauch did not take batting practice Tuesday, will try to play Wednesday and if he can't, Manager JOE TORRE said he might be placed on the disabled list. . . . The Yankees announced Tuesday that the right-hander ADRIAN HERNANDEZ had been promoted from Class A Tampa to Class AA Norwich. The Cuban native, whose nickname is El Duquecito, is not related to the Yankees starter ORLANDO HERNANDEZ. . . . DAVID CONE on his struggles: ''If I can't get it done anymore, there's no shame in that. I believe I can. I'm more determined than ever. The last thing I want to do is go out on this type of a roll.''</p>
