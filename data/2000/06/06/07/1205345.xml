        <p>TORSTEN SCHMALE and Christian Wessel started Inubit, their Berlin-based business-to-business software and services company, in December after their respective girlfriends decided that they had had enough of listening to them complain about their jobs.</p>
        <p>The women, who work together at another company, persuaded Dr. Schmale, who was bored with his job as a software developer for Siemens, and Mr. Wessel, who was sick of his job as a consultant with Roland Berger &amp; Partners, a management consulting firm, to meet. They did, and quickly hit upon an idea for a technology platform that would enable business-to-business marketplaces. In doing so, they joined a wave of business-to-business start-ups in Germany. (After the business idea was hatched, the couples got married.)</p>
        <p>The beginnings of Germany's Internet start-up revolution can be traced to June 1999, when eBay purchased Alando.de, a German online auction company, for $43 million. Since then, the start-up scene has accelerated, causing investor interest to shift from businesses selling to consumers to those servicing other businesses. The  emerging business-to-business climate is healthy and likely to continue growing. Indeed, Forrester Research, a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., predicts that by 2004, Germany will lead Europe with 26 percent of all e-commerce activity, followed by Britain, with 18 percent.</p>
        <p>The business-to-business landscape in Germany, however, will look different from its early-stage counterpart in the United States. A crucial difference is that in Germany, corporate players are recognizing the importance of the business-to-business market almost in tandem with start-ups. DaimlerChrysler, Bayer, Volkswagen and Siemens are creating e-commerce marketplaces to procure goods or have plans to do so, and both SAP and Intershop Communications are also interested in expanding into such commerce.</p>
        <p>''Big companies were faster in realizing the potential of business-to-business e-commerce in Germany than in the U.S.,'' said Reinhard Edelmann, an investment manager with Technologieholding, a Berlin venture-capital firm. One result, said Thorsten Wichmann, the chief executive of Berlecon Research, a research and analysis firm also in Berlin, is that ''niche markets are where start-ups are coming in.''</p>
        <p>Inubit is focusing on European niche markets, along with other start-ups, including  Newtron.de, Surplex.de and Portum.de. (The ''de'' stands for Deutschland.) Inubit has built a business-to-business technology platform and is planning to join with established companies to create industry-specific marketplaces. So far, Inubit has one partner, the Floramedia Group, a horticulture company with a pan-European presence.</p>
        <p>Even if big companies are quicker on the draw in Germany, enough business-to-business start-ups have taken root in the last six months to spawn more than 100 online marketplaces, according to Berlecon's research.</p>
        <p>Inubit, as is typical for a German business-to-business company, is fashioning itself as a European company -- one that needs to adapt to multiple countries, cultures and languages from the get-go. ''We're looking at the European market, which is like the worldwide market -- from an organizational perspective, it's the same,'' Mr. Wessel explained. ''If you're a B-to-B start-up in Germany, it doesn't make sense to stay in the German market. We programmed our technology so that if someone comes in and says he's from Spain, he gets Spanish content.''</p>
        <p>This approach, according to Mr. Edelmann, of Technologieholding, is what distinguishes European e-commerce ventures from American ones. ''We're used to dealing with other cultures,'' he said, ''and Americans are not.'' Many American companies add multiple language abilities to their technology only after they stake a claim in the United States market, Mr. Edelmann said, rather than integrating them from the start.</p>
        <p>Multiple languages are just the beginning. ''The European market is not homogenous like the U.S. market,'' said Patrick Sheehan, the managing director for the United States division of 3i Group, a venture capital firm in London. ''There are quite different market conditions in each country.''</p>
        <p>European companies have to take into account the different business processes, tax systems, cultures, market structures, labor laws and governments from country to country. ''To address your market you have to have a whole different set of business approaches,'' Mr. Wessel said. Even the level of technological adoption -- which varies widely from southern to northern Europe -- is an issue: a European technology company must have different strategies for, say, wired Sweden and analog Spain.</p>
