        <p>James V. Kimsey, an Internet billionaire who grew up in Washington when the area was a cultural backwater, gave $10 million to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts today to help in the steady move away from that status.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimsey, a founder of America Online with Steve Case and now its chairman emeritus, made the donation toward a campaign by the center to add $100 million to its endowment. With his the gift, the center has so far collected $70 million toward that goal. It had an endowment of $80 million when the campaign started.</p>
        <p>''I was born and raised in Washington,'' Mr. Kimsey said, ''and that's the only reason A.O.L. is in Washington. Because it's my hometown.'' The decision to remain in Washington, he added, is good for the company because it faced so many regulatory issues here.</p>
        <p>America Online is actually in the Virginia suburbs, near Dulles International Airport, but Mr. Kimsey speaks of Washington as the  wide metropolitan region.</p>
        <p>''That's why the Kennedy Center is so important as a regional arts center,'' Mr. Kimsey said. ''When I grew up it was a backwater. Now we have Michael Jordan, Placido Domingo and Leonard Slatkin.''</p>
        <p>His citing of the head of the Washington Wizards basketball team, the Washington Opera and the National Symphony Orchestra reflects Mr. Kimsey's twin enthusiasms for sports and the arts.</p>
        <p>In addition to his Kennedy Center donation, Mr. Kimsey has given $7 million to the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., his alma mater, toward an athletic center that will bear his name.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimsey is a trustee of the Kennedy Center, chairman of the Washington Opera and a member of the board of the National Symphony Orchestra. The Kennedy Center said that part of his gift would go toward giving every fifth-grade student in the District of Columbia the opportunity to attend a performance at the center and to endow the principal tuba chair in the orchestra.</p>
        <p>James A. Johnson, chairman of the Kennedy Center, said that the endowment drive was going well.</p>
        <p>''The extraordinary initial response to our endowment drive is a terrific indication of how dedicated this community's arts supporters and our donors across the nation are to the continuing success of the center and the National Symphony Orchestra,'' he said. ''I'm confident we will reach our goal.''</p>
