        <p>IN the March 29 issue of E-Commerce, the writer Sue Cummings described the free-for-all for desirable Web site addresses. She also challenged readers to think up the silliest possible name for a site and invent an equally ridiculous description.</p>
        <p>About 50 entries were received. (Many came in well after April 1, showing perhaps that the paper's readers have the same lack of respect for deadlines as its writers do.)</p>

        <p>IN the March 29 issue of E-Commerce, the writer Sue Cummings described the free-for-all for desirable Web site addresses. She also challenged readers to think up the silliest possible name for a site and invent an equally ridiculous description.</p>
        <p>About 50 entries were received. (Many came in well after April 1, showing perhaps that the paper's readers have the same lack of respect for deadlines as its writers do.)</p>
        <p>The winner, George S. Goodman, was chosen by Ms. Cummings. He surpassed her requirements by proposing a site that would not only be silly, but also completely useless. Not surprisingly, someone has already registered the name.</p>
        <p>DigitalDivide.com would be a Web portal for those who do not have Internet access.</p>
        <p>Submissions by the runners-up spoofed tried-and-true Web formulas. The first runner-up, Robert Kirchherr, proposed a site that would post blather spouted in the presidential campaign: Vacuous.gov, providing ''valuable analysis and insights generated by the presidential campaign.''</p>
        <p>Howard Lev, the second runner-up,  combined the online auction and bulletin board concepts to propose a site that could solve one of life's most pervasive, if not profound, mysteries: LaundryLost.com, a lost-and-found site for laundry. As Mr. Lev describes it, the site would be a place ''where people can post lost-and-found notices (offering a reward) for those lost socks and other garments that go into a washer or dryer but never come out, and where people can auction their own unmatched socks in hopes that someone else needs them to make a 'loving pair' of argyles.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodman will receive a $25 gift certificate to The New York Times Online Store.</p>
