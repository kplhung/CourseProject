        <p>Re ''In Online Auction World, Hoaxes Aren't Easy to See'' (front page, June 2):</p>
        <p>While I appreciate that there are some shady business practices at work in the art world, there is another force to be considered when pointing the finger at sellers on eBay, chiefly the greed that drives many buyers.</p>
        <p>As you mentioned, many people wanted to buy a work possibly painted by Richard Diebenkorn for a price much lower than it was worth. I guess those buyers felt that it was all right that Kenneth A. Walton, the seller, would not have been paid the painting's true value, had it been found to be authentic.</p>
        <p>You cannot save people from themselves. Anyone who tries to buy fine art online without seeing it in person is denying reality. I can't be outraged on their behalf.</p>
