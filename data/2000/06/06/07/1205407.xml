        <p>DESPITE research confirming the connection between food advertising, marketing and the problems of overweight and obesity, the subject was studiously avoided at the National Nutrition Summit in Washington last week. The meeting, convened by the Agriculture and Health and Human Services Departments, was well attended by the food industry.</p>
        <p>''You can't talk about it,'' said Dr. Marion Nestle, the chairwoman of the New York University nutrition and food studies department, one of a handful of speakers who raised questions about the relationship of the food industry to consumption patterns. ''It's totally ignored.''</p>
        <p>One reason for this is that the Agriculture Department has seemingly impossible dual missions: promoting American agricultural products like beef and milk, and advising Americans on nutrition. One calls for eating more, the other for eating less. At the same time, the department and nutritionists increasingly rely on money from the food industry.</p>
        <p>So it is not surprising that neither the new dietary guidelines released at the conference nor speeches by department secretaries discussed how the food industry encourages people to eat more, how it affects people's food choices or how it lobbies to keep nutrition information provided by the government as bland as possible.</p>
        <p>''It is not the function of government to tell people exactly what they should be doing,'' said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. ''We are not national nannies.'' Donna E. Shalala, secretary of Health and Human Services, said the focus of the guidelines and the conference was ''balance and moderation.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, in 1991, when Dr. Louis W. Sullivan was Health and Human Services secretary, he was more forthcoming. ''I believe that a society that is concerned about good health rather than a quick buck would not approve of industry advertising designed to increase children's consumption of candy bars, sugary cereals, salty canned foods and so on -- products with minimal nutritional value,'' he said then.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sullivan was not suggesting legal restrictions on such advertising, but, he said, it was appropriate ''to ask the food industry and advertisers to act more responsibly.''</p>
        <p>Before last week's conference, Gene Grabowski, a vice president of the Grocery Manufacturers of America, said he called reporters ''to make sure this summit doesn't degenerate into a finger-pointing contest where people point at makers of confections and sodas saying that's the reason people are obese. It's a lot more complicated than that.''</p>
        <p>The pre-emptive strike was probably unnecessary. The two government departments, no longer able to pay for a variety of nutrition education initiatives because Congress has cut their budgets, have turned to the food industry. For example, the dietary guidelines issued in 1995 were distributed by the Food Marketing Institute, and the new ones probably will be as well.</p>
        <p>Associations that represent the food industry have also created the Dietary Guidelines Alliance in partnership with the government. The alliance says its mission is to end confusion about nutrition, like the belief that there are good foods and bad foods. To the alliance, whether it's a carrot or a candy bar, there are no such things as bad foods.</p>
        <p>Many nutrition educators are also relying more on the industry for university salaries and research. ''It's about partnerships and funding,'' said Dr. Isobel Contento, professor of nutrition at Columbia Teachers College. In the last 30 years, she said, her profession has become ''much more reluctant to say anything that will offend food advertisers.''</p>
        <p>''So many organizations need the funding,'' she continued. ''In subtle ways it influences you in what you criticize and the way you criticize.''</p>
        <p>The American Dietetic Association is typical. The fact sheets it provides have corporate sponsors (Monsanto for biotechnology; Procter &amp; Gamble for olestra).</p>
        <p>At the conference, the Agriculture Department announced two research projects that sidestep the issue of the food industry's influence on eating habits. One will explore the value of fad diets; the other, behavioral reasons for obesity.</p>
        <p>As a participant in one panel at the conference, Dr. Nestle tried to suggest that to lose weight, people must eat less. ''It sank without a trace,'' she said. ''The food industry needs people to eat more, not less.''</p>
        <p>The industry spends $30 billion on advertising, including $115 million last year by the Coca-Cola Company for Classic Coke and $1 billion by McDonald's. By contrast, the National Cancer Institute spent $1 million last year on the educational component of its campaign to increase fruit and vegetable consumption.</p>
        <p>Studies by Dr. William H. Dietz when he was director of clinical nutrition at the New England Medical Center in Boston clearly showed the relationship between television watching and obesity in children and teenagers. ''There's no question TV influences food choices,'' he said last week. No wonder food advertisers show their commercials on Saturday morning.</p>
        <p>Food industry lobbying also accounted for the wording of the new dietary guideline for sugar. A draft recommendation said: ''Go easy on beverages and foods high in added sugars.'' By including the word ''added,'' the guideline advisory committee said it was recognizing research showing that ''nondiet soft drinks displace beverages or foods that are richer in essential nutrients, such as milk and fruit juices.''</p>
        <p>The National Soft Drink Association countered: ''There is no scientific evidence to support any changes in dietary guidelines on added sugar.'' In February the guideline was altered: ''Choose beverages and foods that limit your intake of sugar.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Glickman later received a letter from 30 senators, most from sugar states, and from several congressmen who approve the agency's budget, asking him to review the recommendation and ''withhold any new recommendations until and unless they are fully supported by sound science.''</p>
        <p>''Limit'' became ''moderate.''</p>
        <p>''Selling food and having people eat healthfully may not be the same goal,'' Dr. Contento said. ''I think our goals are fundamentally different.''</p>
