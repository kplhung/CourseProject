        <p>A group of investors headed by the Softbank Corporation has signed an agreement to buy the failed Nippon Credit Bank from the government.</p>
        <p>The agreement comes less than a week after the deal fell apart amid differences over the extent to which the government would shield the new buyers should the bank's troubled loans lose more value.</p>
        <p>The purchase is a controversial departure from Softbank's business of investing in Internet-related companies. Softbank, Japan's leading Internet company, will hold a stake of 40 percent to 50 percent in the bank. It sees Nippon Credit as a vehicle for providing cash to young companies and new ventures that have traditionally found it difficult to find financing here.</p>
        <p>Softbank and its two main partners, the Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company and the Orix Corporation, one of Japan's largest leasing companies, will invest some 80 billion yen, or about $752 million at current exchange rates, in Nippon Credit, which had a minimum of 95 billion yen in bad debt on its books when it was nationalized in 1998.</p>
        <p>The Financial Reconstruction Commission, the agency charged with overseeing the reconstruction of the Japanese financial system, said some smaller regional banks, as well as some foreign institutions, would put another 20 billion yen, or $188 million, into the deal, bringing the total price of the bank to 101 billion yen.</p>
        <p>The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial daily, suggested that Lehman Brothers, Chase Manhattan and UBS A.G. might be among the other investors. Lehman already has a relationship with Softbank to sell bonds online.</p>
        <p>The sale is another major step in the government's efforts to overhaul Japan's shaky financial system. The government has now succeeded in selling off the two banks, Nippon Credit and the Long-Term Credit Bank, that it nationalized during the nation's financial crisis in late 1997 and 1998.</p>
        <p>And the introduction of a new breed of player into Japan's insular banking world has the potential to force new business practices onto institutions that have been slow to change despite their near brush with death in 1997 and 1998. ''The new bank may create a new era,'' Sadakazu Tanigaki, the head of the commission, said at a news conference. ''We expect that.''</p>
        <p>It also increases the chances that the Sony Corporation and the Ito-Yokado Corporation will get the banking licenses they have been seeking. There has been political resistance to allowing nonbanks entree into the banking business, but the deal for Nippon Credit will establish a precedent.</p>
        <p>Softbank sees Nippon Credit as the cornerstone of an online financial empire. The bank presumably will provide settlement services for Softbank's e-commerce businesses and serve as a foundation linking the company's investments in ventures like E*Trade and Nasdaq Japan, the new stock market that is scheduled to open this month.</p>
        <p>But while the visions of both Softbank and the government are compelling, doubts abound. Indeed, Masayoshi Son, Softbank's founder and the chief proponent of purchasing Nippon Credit, cautioned that several hurdles had yet to be overcome.</p>
        <p>The Softbank group lost its exclusive rights to bid on the bank last week when it missed a deadline for reaching an agreement because it insisted on hiring its own accountants to assess the bank's portfolio, among other demands.</p>
        <p>Its demands that the government offer it protection against further declines in the value of certain already problematic loans after the sale also met resistance. The reconstruction commission has recently been criticized by politicians, who are heading into an election at the end of the month, for making such guarantees to the buyers of the Long-Term Credit Bank.</p>
        <p>The costs to the taxpayer of the Long-Term Credit failure keep ratcheting higher as the bank, which reopened yesterday as the Shinsei Bank, takes advantage of the government's promise to cover further deterioration in its loan portfolio. Two of Shinsei's big clients, Dai-Ichi Hotels and Life, an insurance company, have gone bankrupt in the last month, and several other clients have asked for substantial debt waivers. Under the terms of the sale, Shinsei can pass those losses on to the government.</p>
        <p>The Softbank group is thus not likely to get the same deal, analysts say, although Mr. Son suggested that his group is still demanding protection from further deterioration in Nippon Credit's loan portfolio.</p>
        <p>But the group gave in to government demands that it use Nippon Credit's former auditors to assess the value of the bank's loans, rather than having its own accountants. ''If they haven't been able to secure the same sort of deal that Long-Term Credit has, then definitely asset quality is of a concern,'' said James P. Fiorillo, senior banking analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo. ''Giving in on the auditor could also come back to haunt them.''</p>
        <p>The potential concessions deepened concerns here that Softbank was ill-equipped to handle its pending purchase. The company has a bad track record when it comes to buying established companies. Last year, Softbank sold two acquisitions that cost it money, its Ziff-Davis publishing unit and Kingston Technologies, a computer chip maker.</p>
        <p>''This is the largest, most dangerous thing Softbank has done, and it has none of the competitive requirements to make the undertaking successful,'' said Ben Wedmore, who follows the Internet business in Japan at HSBC Securities. ''Its determination to buy this bank, despite its weak history with companies like Ziff-Davis, is nothing short of pathological.''</p>
