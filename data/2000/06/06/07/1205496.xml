        <p>A House committee today disclosed scores of long-disputed internal government documents at the heart of a bitter debate over whether Attorney General Janet Reno should have sought an independent counsel to investigate accusations of Democratic fund-raising abuses in the 1996 campaign.</p>
        <p>The documents, parts of which have been previously reported by various news organizations, provide insights into the intense battle between top officials at the F.B.I. and the Justice Department over an independent counsel. The fighting quickly escalated to a confrontational level in late 1996 after news reports about possible improprieties cast a shadow over President Clinton's re-election.</p>
        <p>The material was released by the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, whose head, Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, said, ''Can you blame the American people or many in Congress for being cynical?''</p>
        <p>The papers suggest the intense behind-the-scenes conflict among top law enforcement officials who battled each other with scathing memorandums. Both sides were trying to sway Ms. Reno about the necessity of having an independent prosecutor investigate soft-money contributions, sham donations and multifaceted schemes to raise millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>There is no indication that Ms. Reno based her refusal to seek an independent counsel on political grounds, as Republicans have often asserted. Rather, her aides said today, the documents show that she based her actions on sometimes narrow but legally defensible interpretations of the law.</p>
        <p>But in one memorandum by Louis J. Freeh, the F.B.I. director, he cautioned Ms. Reno that the Justice Department had been blind to ''reliable evidence'' uncovered by investigators that Mr. Freeh said contradicted Vice President Al Gore's statements about fund-raising.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh favored the early appointment of an independent counsel to investigate campaign finance issues. His stance began a downward spiral in his once-warm relationship with Ms. Reno, and her dealings with Mr. Freeh are said by aides to have become coolly formal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh's Nov. 24, 1997, memorandum, written by staff members at his request, urged Ms. Reno to refer the finance matter related to Mr. Gore to an independent counsel.</p>
        <p>''In the face of compelling evidence that the vice president was a very active, sophisticated fund-raiser who knew exactly what he was doing, his own exculpatory statements must not be given undue weight,'' the memorandum said.</p>
        <p>In his memorandum, Mr. Freeh said the F.B.I. agents on the case had wanted to investigate a ''core group'' of senior administration officials, including Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore. That strategy, Mr. Freeh said, was based ''on a theory that most of the alleged campaign abuses flowed, directly or indirectly, from the all-out effort by the White House and the D.N.C. to raise money.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Freeh said the Justice Department had initially frustrated the ''core group'' investigative plan,  preferring to focus first on lower-level aides in an effort to move up the chain of command.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh's memorandum is one of two documents that Republicans have used for the last two years to batter Ms. Reno over her refusal to refer the case to an outside prosecutor. The other memorandum, also released today, was written by Charles G. La Bella, the former chief of the Justice Department's campaign finance unit, the in-house team that investigated the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. La Bella's memorandum, dated July 16, 1998, as he was stepping down from his post after 10 months, is a longer and more free-ranging narrative of the Democratic Party's fund-raising practices. He portrayed the party as an organization powerfully motivated to raise money by the terror of losing the election.</p>
        <p>Mr. La Bella said his unit had been prevented from investigating the campaign finance issue in its totality to decide whether high-level officials referred to as covered officials had committed a crime.</p>
        <p>Internal rebuttal documents are also among the thousands of pages of documents made public today, including a memorandum by Lee J. Radek, head of the Justice Department's public integrity unit. Mr. Radek was responsible for the campaign finance inquiry and advised Ms. Reno against the appointment of an independent counsel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Radek, in a reply to Mr. La Bella's memorandum, wrote on Aug. 5, 1998, that Mr. La Bella's conclusion that a prosecutor should be appointed was ''flawed and based on numerous misinterpretations of the Independent Counsel Act.''</p>
