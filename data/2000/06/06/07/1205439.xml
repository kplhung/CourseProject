        <p>AFTER a campaign urging smokers to ''B Kool,'' which was embraced as enthusiastically as a tobacco company executive at a lung health conference, the maker of the venerable Kool brand is headed back to the drawing board. Indeed, the new advertising for Kool, sold by the Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation, seems as if it were grabbed from the drawing board while the art director ducked out for a cigarette break.</p>
        <p>The campaign by Bates USA in New York, just getting under way with print ads and signs in stores, replaces the two-year-old ''B Kool'' theme -- disliked by ad critics almost as much as the ungrammatical ''Winston tastes good like a cigarette should'' was -- with a bold claim, ''We built the house of menthol.''</p>
        <p>That assertion, and a variation declaring the Kool brand family to be ''the house of menthol,'' are delivered in a quirky graphic style meant to stand out amid the clutter of cigarette pitches. Kool is buying ads in magazines and newspapers in the form of the front and back of a page, then printing most of the type on the back of each ad page backward -- as if the page were transparent.</p>
        <p>The campaign arrives as the tobacco giants scramble to woo customers from one another in the face of growing restrictions on advertising and promotional efforts.</p>
        <p>For instance, one principal Kool competitor, the Salem menthol cigarette brand sold by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, has already revamped its advertising, while another, the Newport menthol line marketed by the Lorillard unit of Loews, is redesigning packages and starting to offer merchandise, called Pleasure Goods, through a catalog.</p>
        <p>In addition, Philip Morris, the largest cigarette maker, is spending lavishly to bring out a new menthol smoke under the Marlboro Milds brand. Several nonmenthol brands are getting new campaigns, too, including Old Gold (''Come around to real value'') from Lorillard, and Winston (''Leave the bull behind'') from Reynolds.</p>
        <p>The ''House of menthol'' claims for Kool, which comes in five varieties including Filter Kings, Milds and Natural Lights, is intended to remind smokers that Kool initiated the menthol category in 1933. However, the brand has lost leadership in the category, which makes up from 25 to 30 percent of all cigarettes sold in this country, primarily because it has been unable to attract customers in their 20's and 30's while many of its faithful older buyers are, well, no longer around.</p>
        <p>Newport has bumped Kool to second in sales from first. If the menthol varieties of Marlboro are counted separately from the regular version, Kool slips to No. 3, though still ahead of Salem.</p>
        <p>''Kool has been around a very long time,'' said Susan Ivey, senior vice president for marketing at Brown &amp; Williamson in Louisville, Ky., the American unit of British American Tobacco. ''It has a fantastic heritage and pedigree, but it has an old profile and peaked in the 70's.</p>
        <p>''The 'B Kool' campaign did provide us improved perceptions about being more contemporary, but did not stake out Kool's menthol authority,'' she added. ''This does.''</p>
        <p>As for the echoes in the new theme of the House of Blues, the music club chain, and the popular song by Jefferson Starship, ''We Built This City,'' Ms. Ivey said: ''Kool had a very long association with the annual jazz festival. And we're active in local markets, in bars and nightclubs, with trial and promotional vehicles like the Kool Mix Program.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ivey declined to discuss the budget for the campaign. Brown &amp; Williamson spent almost $40.3 million to advertise Kool last year, according to Competitive Media Reporting, which tracks ad spending, compared with $53.8 million in 1998. Kool is an important premium-priced brand for Brown &amp; Williamson along with Capri, Carlton and Misty; the company also sells brands including Bel Air, GPC, Raleigh, Tareyton and Viceroy.</p>
        <p>After Bates USA, part of the Bates Worldwide unit of the Cordiant Communications Group, gained the Kool assignment last year from Grey Advertising in New York, ''part of our charge was to see how we could enhance the Kool brand to smokers ages 21 and 30,'' said Richard Newman, executive vice president and worldwide account director.</p>
        <p>''The 'B Kool' campaign suggested it was more contemporary and relevant than they may have thought,'' he added. ''But we wanted to more clearly communicate a product-superiority message.''</p>
        <p>When smokers were asked, ''What does it say to you about a brand that claims to be 'The house of menthol,' we got a lot of positive feedback that it was very much a claim of ownership and rightful heritage,'' Mr. Newman said. The ads also use words and phrases like ''Authentic,'' ''King of all menthols'' and ''The menthol movement.''</p>
        <p>''House'' has ''a lot of different meanings to a lot of different people,'' he added, citing terms like house music, couture house -- and even ''the houses in 'Paris Is Burning,' '' the 1991 documentary about the competition at drag balls in New York between groups of gay black and Latino men known as houses.</p>
        <p>The unusual ''mirror image'' graphics for the campaign, Mr. Newman said, stemmed from creative executives at Bates USA noticing ''that the back of the Kool pack has some great copy about the brand's being in existence a long time and its premium quality.''</p>
        <p>''From a visual standpoint, this has an enormous amount of energy,'' he added, ''and the look and feel are pretty intrusive.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ivey praised the graphic device, which she described as a ''flipped tranny.'' (That's shorthand for transparency, not for transvestite, you ''Paris Is Burning'' fans.)</p>
        <p>''It's meant to get attention and catch people's eye,'' Ms. Ivey said. ''It has a contemporary feel.''</p>
        <p>The ads will appear in publications including Cosmopolitan, Entertainment Weekly, Gear, Glamour, Maxim, Premiere, Rolling Stone, The Sporting News and USA Today. Philip Morris said this week that it would voluntarily withdraw its cigarette ads from some of those publications, citing the number of teenagers who read them. Anti-smoking advocates had recently complained that too many cigarette ads were appearing in publications with significant teenage circulation.</p>
        <p>And for those wondering about how Kool presents the Surgeon General's warning -- required in all cigarette ads -- it is printed frontward on both the front and the back of each Kool ad page.</p>
