        <p>In 1983, a decade or so before soaring rents forced most of the printing industry out of its traditional home near the Holland Tunnel, a new printing company, EMR Systems Communication, decided to set up shop in a 12-story commercial co-op building at 134 West 26th Street.</p>
        <p>Whether that decision was a result of foresight or luck, Mike Reinitz, the chairman and chief executive, is still counting his blessings, for ownership of part of his building helped make it possible to remain in the area.</p>
        <p>''We bought the 10th floor after renting it for two years,'' Mr. Reinitz said, ''and over time we rented three other floors.''</p>
        <p>During that time, the company, which offers digital printing and prepress services for advertising agencies and major corporations, grew from 5 employees to 65. According to trade publications, it is one of the biggest such printers in the country, with annual revenue of $20 million.</p>
        <p>Six months ago, EMR renewed the lease on its three rental floors for 10 more years, and after having spent more than $2 million renovating two floors, it is renovating the 10th floor.</p>
        <p>What is unusual about EMR's decision is not so much its renting space in a commercial co-op as its being able to find such a building.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if there are 10 commercial co-ops in New York or 500,'' said Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the 2,042-member Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, ''but if I had to guess I'd say it's closer to 10.'' She added that, while commercial co-ops are welcome in the organization, she can't recall any that have joined.</p>
        <p>Another veteran of New York real estate, Ira Schuman, executive vice president of Julien J. Studley, a national brokerage company with headquarters in Manhattan, was even more surprised that there was a commercial co-op in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''Even commercial condominiums are fairly rare,'' he said, ''but this is the first commercial co-op I ever heard of.''</p>
        <p>A handful of Manhattan office buildings have used the condominium form of ownership, with owners having title to specific floors or sections of the building. Such arrangements have been especially attractive to foreign companies, many of which prefer to own rather than rent.</p>
        <p>They are also attractive to foundations and other nonprofit groups. The reason is that qualified nonprofit groups are exempt from real estate taxes, which Mr. Schuman said could represent 20 to 25 percent of a tenant's overall rent.</p>
        <p>High among the reasons commercial co-ops are an anomaly in New York is that co-op tenants buy shares of stock in the co-op corporation, for which they receive a proprietary lease but no real estate.</p>
        <p>''Businesses want the ability to sell the lease or assign their interest without having to have the approval of the co-op board,'' said Robert S. Robbin, a partner in the law firm of Gilbert, Segall &amp; Young.</p>
        <p>As in residential co-ops, the elected boards that oversee commercial co-op buildings have powers that go beyond approval of sales or rentals,  as Mr. Reinitz learned firsthand.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Reinitz, who is on the five-member board of his building, sought permission to put a big sign outside the building, he had to settle for a much smaller one inside a window on the ground floor.</p>
        <p>When he wanted to paint the front of his ground-floor storefront brown, the board wanted it beige. Beige it was.</p>
        <p>When he sought permission to install what he described as ''a fancy stainless garage door,'' the board decided it might make the co-op look like a manufacturing building instead of an office building, and detract from its value. He settled for painting the existing double door.</p>
        <p>When he wanted to remove a two-story metal section running across the front of the building to see what was behind it, the board said it liked it the way it was.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reinitz cited those examples not as complaints but as illustrations. ''This place is ideal,'' he said. ''It's where we want to be. We could have put up a magnificent plant in New Jersey, but we're only a few minutes from our advertising clients, and they're in and out of here all day long.'' Most of those clients, he added, have offices between 14th and 23rd Streets, around Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>The ''we'' sprinkled throughout Mr. Reinitz's conversation is recognition that EMR stands for Eric and Michael Reinitz. Eric, 37, his son, is the company's president. He graduated with a degree in printing from the Rochester Institute of Technology, then coaxed his father out of a six-month retirement.</p>
        <p>Another drawback of commercial co-ops is that companies with business offices in a co-op building cannot get the benefit of depreciation on their physical assets.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Reinitz said he had not found that a handicap. Owning one floor in the building has insulated EMR from skyrocketing rents on that part of its office, as have the long-term leases on the other three floors. ''The rent on those floors continues to go up,'' Mr. Reinitz said, ''but we can live with them.''</p>
        <p>In contrast, he said, many printers in Manhattan who were paying $6 to $8 a square foot had their rents raised at least four or fivefold to as much as $50 a square foot when landlords discovered they could convert the space to luxury lofts.</p>
        <p>''It's been rough on most of them, especially the ones in big buildings,'' Mr. Reinitz said. ''Some printers moved to Long Island City, but many of them had to merge. We're one of the lucky ones.''</p>
