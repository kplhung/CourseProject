        <p>ALTENAU-Grace, M.D. Her friends and colleagues at Lutheran Medical Center mourn the loss of Dr. Grace Altenau. Most recently an honorary member of our staff, Dr. Altenau began her affiliation with Lutheran Medical Center in 1936 when she served her internship and residency in Pediatrics at LMC. A graduate of NYU Medical School and board certified in Pediatrics for over 50 years, Dr. Altenau was one of the ''pioneer'' women physicians. She served on the faculty of SUNY Downstate and was Director of Pediatrics at Swedish Hospital. We offer our heartfelt condolences to her family. Her friendship, loyalty and dedication will be missed by all of us. Steven W. Salvati, M.D., President Lutheran Medical Center Medical and Dental Staff Dominic J. Lodato, President Lutheran Medical Center</p>
