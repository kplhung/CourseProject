        <p>Cameron F. MacRae, one of the nation's leading public utility lawyers, died May 29 at the Jupiter Medical Center in Florida, according to his son, Cameron F. MacRae III. He was 94 and lived in Hobe Sound, Fla.</p>
        <p>A founding name partner of the New York law firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &amp; MacRae, Mr. MacRae used his training as a civil engineer to become an expert on electric and gas utility law. He served as president of the Federal Energy Bar Association from 1969 to 1970 and was outside legal counsel to numerous utilities, including Consolidated Edison, Potomac Electric Power and Georgia Power.</p>
        <p>''Everyone turned to him for advice,'' said Donald J. Greene, the firm's remaining name partner.</p>
        <p>''Among his greatest achievements was to persuade the regulators and the community of the rightness of the rate increases of utilities when they were in desperate need of it'' during the late 1960's, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. MacRae, who served as chairman until his retirement in 1980, also helped expand the firm's presence in the United States and overseas.</p>
        <p>''He was a real old-school gentleman and, underneath it, a very tough lawyer,'' recalled his son, who is currently a senior partner at LeBoeuf Lamb.</p>
        <p>Born in Wilmington, N.C., Mr. MacRae received a degree in civil engineering from the University of North Carolina in 1926. He then worked as an engineer in Pittsburgh until the Depression. As work for engineers became scarce, he moved to New York and decided to become a lawyer, going to school at night, according to his son. ''They weren't building anything; they needed lawyers,'' his son said. He earned a law degree from New York Law School in 1937.</p>
        <p>During World War II, Mr. MacRae played a key role at the Readjustment Division of the War Department, charged with helping the nation's manufacturers to convert their production to weapons and war equipment. A colonel in the United States Army, Mr. MacRae was awarded the Legion of Merit. He joined LeBoeuf in 1958.</p>
        <p>Mr. MacRae's wife, the former Jane Miller, an artist who wrote and illustrated children's books, died in 1996. Mr. MacRae is survived by his son and two granddaughters, all of New York City.</p>
