        <p>THE menu might have been perfect, exactly what the group craved that night. But who could tell? There, in the middle of the dining room at the new Baldoria, far from the wall sconces and the pink aura of the jukebox, Barbara Pearlman and her friends just couldn't be sure.</p>
        <p>The light was a dim glow and the menu, instead of a revelation, was a struggle. Then, Kermit Gordon, one of Ms. Pearlman's companions, came to the rescue.

        <p>THE menu might have been perfect, exactly what the group craved that night. But who could tell? There, in the middle of the dining room at the new Baldoria, far from the wall sconces and the pink aura of the jukebox, Barbara Pearlman and her friends just couldn't be sure.</p>
        <p>The light was a dim glow and the menu, instead of a revelation, was a struggle. Then, Kermit Gordon, one of Ms. Pearlman's companions, came to the rescue. He whipped out a little flashlight. Soon, the flashlight began to make its way around the table, blinking from menu to menu, scanning the possibilities, like a light from a ship on a dark sea.</p>
        <p>But the fact is that Baldoria, compared with some other restaurants in New York, is hardly a challenge. In fact, it's almost bright. In recent years more restaurants have veered closer to nightclubs, with hidden addresses, incredible noise levels and lower and lower lighting. Some have become so dim that you don't know if you're in the theater or a mosh pit. Diners can be seen corralling votive candles to read the menu, and some restaurants have conceded the difficulty.</p>
        <p>At Blue Hill, one waiter keeps a penlight in his pocket and will stand by, shining it onto your menu on request. Other waiters there will give you a small Eveready light, yours to keep if you wish. Cello keeps a pair of reading glasses tucked into a drawer at the maitre d'hotel's stand.</p>
        <p>''We noticed people squinting,'' said Simone Banos, Cello's director of private events.</p>
        <p>Just don't expect anyone to turn up the lights for you. Learn to feel for your fork.</p>
        <p>Consider a recent evening at Commune. At midnight there was a wait for tables. It was a rowdy scene: a man and a few women at a nearby table were dancing, others were eating and talking with excited animation and waiters in black advanced through the crowded room like foxes, moving in and out of the shadows.</p>
        <p>One diner, Charles Fischler, seemed to have shut it all out. He was as still as a rock, staring at the plate of steak frites under his nose. There was nothing troubling about the steak frites, he said, but what was that ominous greenish-black mound next to them? He took a bite. It was spinach.</p>
        <p>''It's very dramatic,'' said Roxine Brown, Mr. Fischler's wife, ''but there's a fundamental need when you go to a restaurant to be able to read the menu.''</p>
        <p>That is just barely possible to do at Grace in TriBeCa, another restaurant where the waiters are armed with flashlights. There the light seeps from behind the banquettes and from lamps hanging from the ceiling. They are so dim and the type on the menu is so dense that my dinner partners and I were all hunched over our menus like horses at a trough. At a nearby table everyone was huddled around a single menu and a votive candle.</p>
        <p>This was nothing, though, compared with what it did to the duck cakes. They were delicious, but in the light they looked like beat-up hockey pucks. To the seared tuna, the lighting was absolutely cruel.</p>
        <p>Adam Tihany, the designer of Jean Georges and Le Cirque 2000, has begun lighting the area where the chef puts finishing touches on the food the same way he lights the dining room, so the chef can see how the food will look to the diner.</p>
        <p>Paul Sale, the executive chef at Icon, said the low lighting does bother him occasionally. ''We put a lot of effort into the look of the food,'' he said, ''and if the guest doesn't get to see it all that often, it's not that good on our part.'' But, he added, the lighting does bring in the kind of clientele the restaurant wants.</p>
        <p>The focus, clearly, is not on the food or the comfort of clear vision, but on the mood of the pool and look of the people filling the water. These restaurants, said David Rockwell, who designed Nobu and Heartbeat, both dim and moody places, ''certainly do send an immediate signal out that this is a sexy place.''</p>
        <p>That's the point at Icon, which has a few hanging lamps and sconces but mostly tiny pin lights and votive candles. ''It's a romantic place,'' said Michael Trenk, the restaurant director. ''There are a lot of couples. It's something we encourage.''</p>
        <p>But Icon is also serious about the food, which is why the pin lighting is directed in circles on top of most tables. You look great sitting back in the shadows, and the food looks great in the spotlight: sauces sparkle, salad greens glow like gems. But when you move forward to take a bite, an unfortunate collision occurs between the light and your nose, casting a large, long shadow and making you look as if you're being interrogated.</p>
        <p>''Pinpoint spots or recessed lights are the death of a good lighting scheme,'' said Peter Guzy, a partner at Asfour Guzy Architects, which designed Blue Hill, Blue Ribbon and Alison on Dominick Street. That is why many new restaurants do not have any direct lighting at all.</p>
        <p>Oddly, today's dim lighting demonstrates how important a design element lighting has become. ''Lighting is one of the most powerful tools that an architect designer has,'' Mr. Rockwell said. ''It is the one thing that can literally alter mood, create intimacy, affect the senses.''</p>
        <p>Darkness defined with striking lighting can transform an ordinary place into something with a design identity. Many restaurants use multiple sources -- say, light glowing from behind tapestry or bounced off a wall -- and layer the light in three-dimensional effects. An open room like Commune, for instance, can be made to feel like many smaller rooms. There are corners cast in red light, tables under onyx fixtures and corridors of shadow. Most restaurant lighting systems are set on computerized dimmer systems, programmed to dim imperceptibly as the night wears on.</p>
        <p>Dim light can also hide design flaws and wear and tear. No one would ever have noticed the fraying in the carpet beneath my table at Icon.</p>
        <p>It works wonders for Hell's Kitchen on Ninth Avenue. As nighttime falls on the restaurant, candles and weak wall sconces tone down garish orange and red tiles on the bar and stodgy details like home-style wood moldings and metallic light plates above funky chandeliers.</p>
        <p>Lots of things look better in the dark.</p>
        <p>''I find as I'm getting older, the darker the restaurant the better,'' said Ms. Pearlman, a Manhattan fitness consultant. ''Your wrinkles are less obvious to your dining partner. Dark, sexy lighting is alluring.''</p>
        <p>Many restaurants are like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde from day to night. Grace, which has skylights, is filled with light during the day. Coffee Shop in Union Square feels like a diner on Route 66, with sunlight streaming through thick blinds. By the time night sets in, it is like a den, with hazy yellow recessed lighting and lots of candles. Every diner, whether in a T-shirt or a strappy dress, has an alluring glow.</p>
        <p>The effect that most restaurant designers are after, in fact, is candlelighting, said Paul Gregory, the owner of Focus Lighting in Manhattan, which has designed the lighting for Nobu, Le Cirque 2000 and Monkey Bar. Candlelight's soft, flickering glow allows you to see a person's face clearly, yet is gentle and flattering. It also has a psychological appeal, acting as a kind of miniature hearth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon, who supplied the beam of light at Baldoria, always keeps a few of the tiny flashlights in his pocket when he goes to a restaurant, and he gives them out like candy. Whenever he pulls them out, he said, ''waiters and waitresses say, 'Can I have it, can I have it?' and I end up giving them away.'' He has been known to drop off a handful on his way out of a dark restaurant.</p>
        <p>There is a happy medium to be found. At the end of a blistering-hot day last week, slipping below street level into the dark, cool cave of Blue Hill was a kind of relief. It felt good that it was dark. Once your eyes adjusted, it was light enough to read the menu, and yet there was no direct light. The banquettes were backlighted, and thin slivers cut into the low ceiling allowed warm incandescent light to fall over the room. It was warm. It was sexy. It made everyone look good. And you could pick up the variations of green in the salad.</p>
        <p>And if that doesn't work, then only Les Routiers on the Upper West Side will. There, every table has its own dimmer, set to medium, for you to fiddle with.</p>
        <p>Most diners turn them down.</p>
