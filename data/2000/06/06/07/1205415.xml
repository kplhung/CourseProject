        <p>On his second album, ''The Marshall Mathers LP,'' the rapper Eminem makes fun of the boy band 'N Sync in at least four separate songs. But last week he entered the same pop league as 'N Sync when his second album sold more copies in its first week of release than any other act, with the sole exception of 'N Sync. ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' (Aftermath/Interscope) sold more than 1.7 million copies; 'N Sync moved 2.4 million copies of ''No Strings Attached'' when it was released in March, according to the Hartsdale, N.Y., music-tracking company Soundscan, which has been compiling the Billboard pop charts since 1991.</p>
        <p>Eminem now holds the record for best first-week sales by a solo act, beating out Britney Spears, who just the week before set a record with sales of 1.3 million of her album ''Oops! . . . I Did It Again.''</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Spears, 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys have been pop music's reigning blockbuster acts, the intrusion of the white rapper Eminem onto teeny-bopper turf comes as little surprise. These record holders for sales in the first week all did so with their second albums. But Eminem is the only one with appeal to fans in all three genres dominating popular music: rock, rap and teeny-bopper pop. He is also one of the very few current acts that in a very segregated commercial radio world has managed to find success for his singles on both rap and rock radio simultaneously.</p>
        <p>When Eminem's debut, ''The Slim Shady LP,'' was released in 1999, the issue surrounding the record was Eminem's color: never before had a white rapper received as much respect and as big an endorsement from the hip-hop community. But on ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' (titled by his real name), Eminem moves beyond issues of race. Unlike Kid Rock, the Detroit rap-metal singer who celebrates the pimp life on his new album, Eminem never brandishes ill-fitting street slang or postures as a gangsta in an attempt to appear credible. ''I just do not got the patience/To deal with these cocky Caucasians/Who think I'm just some whigger who tries to be black,'' he raps. The issue with ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' is not the color of Eminem's skin but its thinness.</p>
        <p>Throughout the album, he vents (often naming names) at pesty autograph seekers, distant family members, nay-saying record executives, critical music writers, his wife's parents, shallow pop stars, politicians and just about anyone who has acknowledged his success positively or negatively in the past year, including himself and his mentor, Dr. Dre. Far from making him happy, success has made Eminem perhaps pop's greatest angry, troubled white boy since Kurt Cobain.</p>
        <p>But Eminem's gifts are very different from those of his angry white self-hating predecessors. He is a master rhymer, convincing actor, stinging critic of critics and vicious prankster. He is blessed with the ability to make any two words with a letter in common rhyme, filling his albums with a logorrhea brimming with complex internal rhyme schemes and rhythmic repetitions. Backed by the beats of Dr. Dre and an understudy, Mel-Man, the best songs pop out of the speakers with the visceral clarity and squealing, minimalist drive of the finest work of Dr. Dre, who lacks the lyric-writing skill that Eminem offers.</p>
        <p>Instead of celebrating his success this week, Eminem was taken into police custody along with his wife after (in a case of life imitating art imitating life) a brawl outside a Detroit nightclub with autograph seekers, during which an unloaded gun fell to the ground. (Eminem was released from custody and it is unclear if the weapon was his and if formal charges will be filed.)</p>
        <p>It is as if he was continuing to live the rage of ''The Marshall Mathers LP,'' which, with the exception of 2 of its 18 songs, grapples exclusively with his whirlwind success as an unlikely (to himself, at least) pop star. Though it may be a pop cliche to devote a second album to the hardships of the fame that came with the first, Eminem dissects the topic so furiously and honestly that the record stands as a fresh achievement. ''I never knew I, knew I would get this big/I never knew, knew I'd affect this kid,'' runs the chorus of one of several songs in which Eminem rails against holding his music accountable for the actions of listeners.</p>
        <p>The message of the album is: if you push Eminem, he's going to push you back -- much harder. On his first album he was criticized for the song ''97 Bonnie and Clyde,'' in which he fantasizes about murdering the mother of his daughter with the child watching. Instead of apologizing, he names a song, ''Kim,'' after the woman (whom he actually married between those albums) and delivers a back story to the murderous fantasy with one of pop's most harrowing and eerily realistic depictions of domestic violence.</p>
        <p>After promoting his last album, Eminem was sued by his mother for $10 million because of statements depicting her as a drug user and a bad parent. Instead of remaining silent on the subject, as his lawyers probably would have preferred, he begins album No. 2 with a fantasy of raping her before elaborating on her alleged drug use. Unapologetic throughout, he returns on ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' more violent, misanthropic and homophobic than ever, aided by his joker gangsta pseudonym Slim Shady (an alter ego to Mr. Mathers's alter ego Eminem).</p>
        <p>This is a complicated man we're dealing with on ''The Marshall Mathers LP.'' At times, the real Marshall Mathers appears, most effectively in the song ''Stan,'' which revolves around a series of fictional letters from a fan whose obsession mounts with each unanswered missive. Unaware that Stan has just committed a suicide-homicide by driving a car containing his pregnant girlfriend off a bridge, Eminem scribbles a response in a rare levelheaded moment, explaining that the violence he raps about is often in jest and that his fan should treat his girlfriend better and seek psychiatric help.</p>
        <p>Though this is such a specifically personal album, another reason for its appeal is that at the same time Eminem represents a duality most people are plagued with, between the responsible, conscientious and productive member of society, ''just a regular guy'' he says in the song ''Marshall Mathers,'' and the unconscionable, responsibility-shirking, revenge-seeking Slim Shady (''out of your mind and out of control''). Eminem never makes it clear which character -- Slim Shady or Marshall Mathers -- is the mask and which is the real person, because there is no clear-cut answer, except that there's a little bit of each character in all of us. Or, as Eminem raps, ''Every person is a Slim Shady lurking/He could be working at Burger King/Spitting on your onion rings.''</p>
