        <p>ON the Web site of the East Liberty Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh, a visitor can see photographs of the historic church, check the schedule of potluck dinners, research the church's history, read recent sermons, connect with other members and even get directions to the church, known as the Cathedral of Hope.</p>
        <p>The one thing the visitor cannot do at the site, www.cathedralofhope.org, is spend money.

''This is a nonprofit organization,'' said Jeffry Blake Johnson, the church's associate director of music and its Internet coordinator. ''We're in the business of providing community, and not in the business of making money. Everything we do, we lose money. Why should the Web site be any different?''</p>

        <p>ON the Web site of the East Liberty Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh, a visitor can see photographs of the historic church, check the schedule of potluck dinners, research the church's history, read recent sermons, connect with other members and even get directions to the church, known as the Cathedral of Hope.</p>
        <p>The one thing the visitor cannot do at the site, www.cathedralofhope.org, is spend money. No banner advertisements flash across the screen, and no one is trying to sell, buy, trade or solicit. ''This is a nonprofit organization,'' said Jeffry Blake Johnson, the church's associate director of music and its Internet coordinator. ''We're in the business of providing community, and not in the business of making money. Everything we do, we lose money. Why should the Web site be any different?''</p>
        <p>While almost everyone is trying to figure out how to make money on the Web, most congregations remain commercial-free zones. But that does not mean they are not thinking about e-commerce. The challenge for religious organizations is incorporating e-commerce into their primary missions and making it consistent with their messages.</p>
        <p>''There's a sense of, 'How are we going to steer our way around commerce?' '' said Edward J. Murray, the president of the National Interfaith Cable Coalition, which will soon introduce a virtual network called Faithandvaluesmedia.org. ''The answer is, we won't. We'll be there to offer people what they need to carry out their missions. But whatever commerce we'll do, it will be related to our mission.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray noted that his group, like its constituent church groups, was a nonprofit corporation. But ''that doesn't require you to lose money,'' he said. ''We'll operate within the not-for-profit boundaries; any margin will go back into our ministry.''</p>
        <p>Some churches and religious organizations are cautiously experimenting with a limited amount of e-commerce, like the sale of religious books and gifts. But deciding what fits and what does not is not easy.</p>
        <p>Most everyone would agree that selling Bibles fits. But what about best sellers like ''Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul'' or New Age music? Kosher and hallal foods? Acupuncture and reflexology treatments?  Funerals? Then there is the highly profitable area of spiritual and religious travel --  trips to the Holy Land and Rome, as well as to Lourdes, the Ganges River and Tibet. Do these fit? Should they be priced for profit or for maximum dissemination?</p>
        <p>''Throw it all together and we're talking about a $40 billion market,'' said Robert Nylen, a co-founder and co-chairman of Beliefnet.com, a commercial Internet business that offers an online spiritual community for prayer and knowledge against a backdrop of advertisements. Beliefnet will soon introduce Web Start, a template for congregations to create sites linked to Beliefnet and its commercial ventures.</p>
        <p>The number of congregations with Web sites is unknown, but it is clearly growing. Tens of thousands of churches have them, with Roman Catholics leading the way. Of the 189 dioceses in the United States (each with dozens or hundreds of churches), 82 percent are on the Internet. Of the 11,000 congregations in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, about 2,000 are on the Web. Of the 800 Conservative Jewish congregations, roughly half are online.</p>
        <p>One church that has taken the plunge into e-commerce is Grace Episcopal Cathedral in San Francisco. At www.gracecathedral .org, users find an archive of sermons and inspirational columns and features. There is also a virtual tour of the Gothic cathedral and a church bulletin, Gracenotes. But the home page included an icon -- computer, not religious -- with prayerful hands that said, ''Support Grace Online by Shopping at Amazon.com.'' The church receives a commission for sales made through the site.</p>
        <p>Visitors to Gracecathedral.org can also join the church online (credit cards accepted) and shop at the cathedral gift shop for books, videos and jewelry.</p>
        <p>McKenzie Ward, a spokeswoman for the church, said the items sold online were related to the church, like labyrinths, the medieval meditation paths that people walk through or trace with their fingers. Ms. Ward said that the cathedral had not signed up with any of the virtual-religion networks and that it was proceeding cautiously into e-commerce.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Jerome M. Epstein, the executive vice president of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, acknowledged that a few years ago, he considered Web sites to be passing fads. Today, Rabbi Epstein said, they are becoming essential tools that link congregants to one another and to their synagogues. People use the sites to stay in touch when they are away. Others looking to move into a community will often use the sites to see what a congregation offers.</p>
        <p>THE potential for church and synagogue sites seems limitless, religious leaders say. Users can stay at home and hear and see the choir and the delivery of the sermon. If they miss the service, they can catch it later.</p>
        <p>And the growing religious presence on the Web means potential customers. ''We've been getting all kinds of pressure to sign up with different businesses and nonprofits,'' the rabbi said. ''We've resisted because we don't want to make our congregations feel that what we're about is merchandising.''</p>
        <p>One person struggling to find a balance between commerce and faith is John Lynner Peterson, the director for public media at the Lutheran Church Association and a consultant to Faithandvaluesmedia.org. He drew a distinction between the Internet's dot-orgs and dot-coms like Beliefnet.com and Christianity.com.</p>
        <p>''We are not responsible to venture capitalists who are putting pressure on their relig.coms to turn a profit,'' Mr. Peterson said. ''We're more interested in being prophetic than in being profitable.''</p>
        <p>What his dot-org group would like to do is link houses of worship from a cross section of denominations. The interfaith group that is sponsoring Faithandvaluesmedia.org is a coalition of 70 religious groups with thousands of churches. United under one network, these groups will be able to share intellectual and spiritual resources.</p>
        <p>''We will be using e-commerce, but commerce won't be the final arbiter of who we are,'' Mr. Peterson said. ''We are about ministry. We are about connecting with people where they are on their spiritual journey.''</p>
