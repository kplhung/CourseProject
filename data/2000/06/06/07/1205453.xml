        <p>An Internal Revenue Service agent testified today in the federal tax-fraud trial of Albert J. Pirro Jr. about a host of expenditures, ranging from prescription drugs to cruise tickets, that he said the defendant improperly deducted as business expenses.</p>
        <p>The witness, testifying for the second day, cited a trip to Los Angeles that Mr. Pirro had taken with his wife, Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, and their two children. There were deductions for a veterinarian and an optician, as well as write-offs for fine jewelry and parking tickets.</p>
        <p>Then there were the cars. The prosecution asked the agent, John Dennehy, to analyze a veritable fleet claimed on corporate tax returns as company cars. Mr. Dennehy testified that the cars were for personal use.  They included two Ferraris belonging to Albert Pirro; Mrs. Pirro's 1989 Mercedes Benz; a 1990 Toyota 4Runner that was sent to Florida, where the couple have a vacation home; a 1992 Mercedes Benz driven by Jeanine Pirro's mother, Esther Ferris, in Elmira, N.Y., and the couple's 1994 Ford Explorer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dennehy is the government's central witness in its case against Mr. Pirro, Westchester County's most powerful real estate lawyer, and his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro. Together, the brothers are accused of improperly deducting more than $1.2 million of Albert Pirro's personal expenses from 1988 to 1997.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Pirro's defense lawyers continually interrupted Mr. Dennehy's testimony with objections, but today's objections came only every half hour or so.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors spent a good deal of time asking Mr. Dennehy about Mr. Pirro's American Express bills from 1992 to 1996, along with the American Express bills of Mr. Pirro's law firm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dennehy testified that $292,226 in American Express charges during those years were for personal expenses, even though they had been deducted on business tax returns.</p>
        <p>Cathy Seibel, the prosecutor, repeatedly asked Mr. Dennehy whether there was any indication that Mr. Pirro or his brother had made any effort to separate personal and business expenses. His answer was no.</p>
        <p>Ms. Seibel also tried to show that Mr. Dennehy was not overzealous in his analysis of the tax returns, eliciting examples of business deductions that Mr. Dennehy did not challenge because he said he was not positive that they were for personal expenses. These included a pair of gloves bought in Italy while Mr. and Mrs. Pirro were on vacation.</p>
