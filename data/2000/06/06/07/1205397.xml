        <p>For 25 years the Opera Theater of St. Louis has believed that the best way to draw American audiences into an appreciation of opera as an involving form of theater is to present works in English only. Naturally, American operas like Scott Joplin's ''Treemonisha,'' which recently opened this adventurous summer company's current season, as well as British operas, have figured often in the repertory. But equally common are European works translated into English, even staples like Verdi's ''Traviata,'' the second of this summer's four operas. Performing opera in translation was once common. But this venerable practice has virtually disappeared with the coming of supertitles.</p>
        <p>There were many reasons why ''Treemonisha'' was an ideal piece for the Opera Theater's anniversary season. Though born in Texarkana, Ark., around 1868, Joplin lived in St. Louis and Sedalia, Mo., for nearly 20 years and he probably composed the first draft of ''Treemonisha'' while a St. Louis resident. The company also hoped to generate interest among the city's large population of African-Americans by presenting this tender opera with its simple story of an 18-year-old black woman who, because she alone among them has had an education, becomes the leader of her community of former slaves on a plantation.</p>
        <p>And yet the company's directors nearly decided against the work for the same reason that other companies have avoided it: the text by Joplin is thick with stereotypical dialect of uneducated, rural black Southerners. When the heroine's good-hearted but gullible mother, Monisha, is tempted by some conniving conjurers to buy a bundle of good-luck charms, her husband, Ned, shouts, ''No, dat bag you'se not gwine to buy,/'Cause I know de price is high!''</p>
        <p>The Opera Theater believed that with the right creative team and cast the authenticity and dignity of the work would come through, even with every word of Joplin's text, flawed by a clunky rhyme scheme, performed as written. Saturday night's performance affirmed that the company had indeed found the right team, headed by the director Rhoda Levine, and the cast, with the affecting young soprano Christina Clark in the title role.</p>
        <p>The opera's three short acts are performed in one seamless 90-minute span. Directing with her typical brilliance, Ms. Levine never allows the audience to forget that the story involves a community of dirt-poor people struggling in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, at once elated and confounded by their freedom and still bound to the place where they had lived as virtual prisoners. Against the backdrop of the earthen sets by Peter B. Harrison, and arrayed in Paul Tazewell's touchingly ragtag costumes of russet, brown and beige, the cast members seem at one with the land.</p>
        <p>Ms. Levine has come up with touches that reveal the subtext of the story. Treemonisha is often surrounded by youngsters eager for her to teach them to read. Even at the devastating moment when she learns that she is not the natural child of Ned and Monisha, some uncomprehending children with books in hand are tugging on her sleeve. Ms. Levine has also found a way to make the outcome of the story less pat.</p>
        <p>Fearful that Treemonisha's enlightening effect on the community is hurting business, two conjurers abduct her. But when she is rescued and the villains are brought forth for punishment, Treemonisha pleads with her family and friends to show mercy. They do, but as directed here they're not happy about it. And once turned loose, the conjurers walk away thinking these people are a bunch of saps. Clearly Treemonisha has a lot of work ahead of her.</p>
        <p>But what ultimately ennobles the opera is Joplin's music. The score is often awkward, yet disarming. Though Joplin was the king of ragtime there are actually few real rags in the opera. The lilt and lyricism of ragtime music run through the score, as does the melancholia that is always part of Joplin's voice, even in such seemingly jolly works as ''The Maple Leaf Rag.'' A gentle sadness pervades every bit of this opera: the recitative; the moments of tension, thick with seventh chords; the confessional arias, like Monisha's moving account of her adopted daughter's origins; even the dances and choruses. And when the time comes for jubilation at the happy ending, what does Joplin provide? ''A Real Slow Drag,'' a wistful dance of subdued joy and hope. As choreographed by the amazing Dianne McIntyre, the number puts to shame all those hyperventilating dance chorus finales on Broadway.</p>
        <p>Ms. Clark's voice, though not large, is warm and true. She made a vulnerable Treemonisha. Geraldine McMillian as Monisha, Kevin Short as Ned, Nathan Granner as Remus, who rescues Treemonisha, and the rest of the cast were wonderful. Jeffrey Huard conducted an aptly restrained performance. (The orchestrations are by Gunther Schuller; Joplin's do not survive.)</p>
        <p>Obviously many opera buffs, and not just purists, would hate hearing an opera as famous as ''La Traviata'' performed in English. Translating a libretto destroys the composer's careful mixing of words and music, the opponents charge. True enough. But compensation comes in the dramatic immediacy gained when singers perform in the language the audience speaks.</p>
        <p>That immediacy was palpable during Friday night's performance of ''La Traviata,'' in an effectively spare production by the director Joshua Major. Here was one of the world's most familiar operas. Yet instead of just assessing another Violetta's dexterity with coloratura, the audience seemed involved in a story happening before them, the tragedy of a beautiful, mortally ill woman whose chosen defense against pain and bitterness is to indulge in a life of excess as a shameless courtesan.</p>
        <p>The translation used here by Edmund Tracey was first commissioned for an English National Opera production in 1973. Of course with such a well-known Italian libretto you have to make some adjustments. The famous arching phrase during Alfredo's avowal of love, ''Misterioso, misterioso, altero,'' becomes ''Mystery rules us, mystery rules for ever.'' Overall the translation is skillfully done. The impact is startling when, left alone to muse about this intriguing new man who has unsettled her, Violetta sings, ''I wonder, I wonder,'' instead of ''E strano! E strano!''</p>
        <p>The excellent soprano Mary Dunleavy brought her bright, full and agile soprano voice, personal grace and dramatic conviction to her portrayal of Violetta. The tenor John Bellemer, who sang Alfredo, has a sweet voice and his English diction was excellent. That said, he is a young man and looks it. This Alfredo was obviously an inexperienced youth smitten with a worldly older woman. The baritone Gary Lehman as Giorgio Germont sang with a rounded, deep-set tone that rendered some of his words indistinct, but he had the properly stiff rectitude to be Alfredo's troubled father. Stephen Lord conducted a deftly paced and shapely performance.</p>
        <p>With these two productions the company also advanced the important cause of color-blind casting. Though the leads in ''Treemonisha'' were black, some white faces were among the plantation workers, just as there were black faces among the guests at Violetta's glittery party in Paris.</p>
        <p>This summer the Opera Theater is also offering Handel's ''Radamisto'' and the premiere (beginning on June 15) of Minoru Miki's ''Tale of Genji,'' with a libretto by Colin Graham, who will also direct. The season continues through June 25.</p>
        <p>Performing works like ''Radamisto'' and ''La Traviata'' in English translation is not preferable, nor always desirable. But it is valid and valuable. Thank goodness that at least one American company maintains the practice.</p>
