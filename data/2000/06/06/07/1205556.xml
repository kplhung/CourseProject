        <p>Great, Reggie Miller must be thinking. Beautiful. About the time the 34-year-old All-Star guard of the Indiana Pacers reaches his first N.B.A. finals and returns home to his native Los Angeles, he has to play the nouveau California kids -- Kobe and Shaquille. Whereas Miller relies on fragile Rik Smits in the post, the Lakers have O'Neal, the most dominant player in the game. And as fast as the Pacers may run, the Lakers will run faster. Here are some other plots to ponder:</p>

        <p>VETERANS VS. THE WUNDERKIND  When you run down the ages of the key players on each team, it may seem as if the Lakers qualified for the N.B.A. finals and the Pacers qualified for their pensions. After all, Kobe Bryant was 8 years old in 1987, Miller's rookie year. But the senior citizen factor is a little misleading. While Miller, Smits and Mark Jackson are motoring toward their 40's, the development of Jalen Rose, Travis Best and Austin Croshere -- all in their 20's -- has reinvigorated the Pacers. And beyond Bryant and O'Neal, the Lakers aren't exactly kids. Ron Harper, Brian Shaw and John Salley were out of basketball at different times over the past three years, contemplating retirement. And for all the dynamics of Bryant in the open floor, Mark Jackson has more Showtime in his veins than any current Laker.</p>

        <p>VETERANS VS. THE WUNDERKIND  When you run down the ages of the key players on each team, it may seem as if the Lakers qualified for the N.B.A. finals and the Pacers qualified for their pensions. After all, Kobe Bryant was 8 years old in 1987, Miller's rookie year. But the senior citizen factor is a little misleading. While Miller, Smits and Mark Jackson are motoring toward their 40's, the development of Jalen Rose, Travis Best and Austin Croshere -- all in their 20's -- has reinvigorated the Pacers. And beyond Bryant and O'Neal, the Lakers aren't exactly kids. Ron Harper, Brian Shaw and John Salley were out of basketball at different times over the past three years, contemplating retirement. And for all the dynamics of Bryant in the open floor, Mark Jackson has more Showtime in his veins than any current Laker.</p>
        <p>THE TWO-SIDED TRIANGLE  Throw out the Game 7 thriller over the Blazers on Sunday -- won in the final 10 minutes -- and the Lakers have every reason to be worried about their scoring ability. They have made a mess of Phil Jackson's triangle offense, failing to use the system during the playoffs the way the Chicago Bulls did en route to their six titles in eight seasons. Sometimes, the Laker offense boils down to Bryant trying to be a playmaker or O'Neal bulling his way inside. If those elements are taken away, their offense often becomes stagnant and predictable. Phil Jackson yelling to his team: ''Forget Shaq. Take your shot,'' between the third and fourth quarters of Game 7 against Portland may have been his most sage advice of the postseason. In the playoffs, the Lakers have been unable to create the shots they often had in the regular season. They almost seem too hung up on what position they should be in within the triangle rather than using it as a rough blueprint for how to better employ their individual skills.</p>
        <p>TALE OF THE TAPE  Surprisingly even. Both teams are 11-6 in the playoffs, and they split their two regular-season meetings. The Pacers were actually the higher-scoring team during the regular season, averaging 101.3 points to the Lakers' 100.8. And the Lakers have given up almost 2 more points a game -- 94.2 -- in the playoffs than they did in the regular season. Meanwhile, if the Pacers have one distinct advantage, it's behind the line. From beyond the arc, they shot an N.B.A.-best .392 during the regular season and .363 in the postseason. And from the free-throw line, they shoot 82 percent as a team compared with 64 percent for the Lakers. If Indiana keeps it close, Larry Bird might be wise to put Bryant, O'Neal and friends on the line.</p>
        <p>MAGIC VS. BIRD, PERIPHERALLY  Phil Jackson appears to be the better story. He is working on his seventh N.B.A. title in nine seasons. In his first year as the Lakers coach, Jackson has made Los Angeles more gritty than pretty, getting his players to buy into a rotating, defensive scheme. But the N.B.A.'s best known practitioner of Zen philosophy must take a backseat to an old reunion: Coach Bird vs. Magic Inc. ''One more time,'' said Johnson, the Lakers' vice president and part owner who is now a full-time businessman. ''I knew it would be at checkers, softball or something. I didn't know it would be basketball.'' The two last convened in the finals in 1987, when Magic's Lakers beat Bird's Celtics in what became one chapter of the N.B.A.'s greatest modern-era rivalry. Although Bird's team will be an underdog again, he is not worried. ''Listening to Magic coach that team out there for a while, I think we might have a shot at it,'' he said, smiling.</p>
        <p>MATCHING UP  Dale Davis, rather than Smits, may get the bulk of the responsibility of defending O'Neal in the low post. And if the Dunking Dutchman can stay out of foul trouble, screen for Miller and slide away for his jump shot, the Lakers may have trouble. Defending the pick and roll is one of their weaknesses. And you wonder how Glen Rice is going to handle Rose, whose arsenal keeps growing with each game. It may be the key matchup in the series. Mark Jackson gives Indiana the nod at point guard and Davis gets the nod over A.C. Green at power forward, but otherwise the Lakers are too young and strong to be stopped on offense. If Rose or Miller can't contain Bryant, no one will.</p>
        <p>SHOWTIME  NBC's sports chairman, Dick Ebersol, claimed he was not rooting for the Lakers on Sunday, but avoiding a Portland-Indiana final was crucial to the ratings. The Blazers simply don't resonate with the casual fan outside of Oregon. With the Pacers-Lakers, you have the most reviled opponent in the league, Miller, playing the villain against the young hopes out West.</p>
        <p>PREDICTION  On paper, how can the Pacers possibly match L.A.'s athleticism? Easy. They incorporate everyone, move the ball, run a motion offense almost foreign to the N.B.A. of the new millennium. Smits can pull O'Neal away from the basket with his range. Rose and Best can attack the basket when the Pacers' offense is going through one of its hiatuses. And Miller is good not only for theater but also for a deciding 3-pointer to force a seventh game. But it is there that O'Neal, Bryant and their teammates learn how much they need one another to realize their potential and pass their greatest test. Lakers in 7.</p>
