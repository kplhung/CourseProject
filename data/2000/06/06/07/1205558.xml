        <p>New York may be second banana to Los Angeles when it comes to the film and television industry, but the city's supporting role is larger than New York officials had realized, according to a study released yesterday.</p>
        <p>Feature film, commercials and television production contributes about $5 billion a year to the city's economy -- twice as much as previous estimates -- and provides about 70,000 jobs, said the report, which was commissioned by the city comptroller's office and the New York City Investment Fund, a private company whose investors include several media companies.</p>
        <p>The Boston Consulting Group, which prepared the study, said that the industry's economic value had  been underestimated because earlier figures were based solely on  permits and did not include pre- and post-production. (But, of course, New York does not come close to Los Angeles County, where film and television are a $31.7 billion industry employing 250,000 people.)</p>
        <p>The study also noted that in New York, there is often overlap between the traditional media and the Internet industry, which generates another $5 billion a year. A study released earlier this year by the New York New Media Association showed that about 100,000 people in New York have Internet-related jobs.</p>
        <p>The comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, said the report showed that more soundstages are needed to accommodate the explosive growth in film and television work. But Arnon A. Mishkin, a vice president of the Boston Consulting Group, said the question of whether there is demand for additional sound stages -- like those proposed for the Brooklyn Navy Yard -- was not specifically addressed in the study.</p>
