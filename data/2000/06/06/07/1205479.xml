        <p>Americans are flying more in this booming economy, but also griping more: about longer lines at airports, longer takeoff delays and tighter limits on carry-on bags. Not to mention the perennial beef about how long it takes just to get to the airport.</p>
        <p>But growing numbers of travelers, particularly in the New York region, are doing more than complaining about tiring business flights or arduous vacation travel. They are bypassing regularly scheduled airlines altogether and finding alternative wings on charter flights or in part ownership of small jets.</p>
        <p>For companies that do not own their own planes, charter flights and so-called fractional ownership of aircraft permit executives to make more efficient use of their traveling time, conducting in-flight meetings and often traveling to small, less-crowded airports much closer to their destinations.</p>
        <p>The appeal is particularly great at a time when travel budgets are fat and a charter seat, in some cases, costs only marginally more than a first-class or business-class ticket on a scheduled airline.</p>
        <p>And while figures vary on the increase in chartering, estimates from industry specialists and individual charter companies suggest a growth range in the last year from 7 percent over all to several times that for some individual operators. This growth comes even as scheduled carriers have reported a 37 percent rise in passengers over the last decade.</p>
        <p>''We're at the epicenter of the charter world,'' said Carole Helms, vice president for marketing at TAG Aviation, a major charter company whose half-dozen bases in the region include Westchester County Airport in Harrison, N.Y., and Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, not far from Manhattan.</p>
        <p>New York's investment banking houses and companies making initial public stock offerings are ''great users of charter,'' she said, adding that business is also brisk in California's Silicon Valley, where software and dot-com denizens are also big on buzzing about in ''air taxis,'' as charters are called in the airline industry.</p>
        <p>Ms. Helms and others in the business say that while most charter flights and partial plane ownerships involve business travel, a growing number are for personal travel.</p>
        <p>One such traveler is James W. Kinnear, the retired president and chief executive of Texaco and now the chairman of the Metropolitan Opera.</p>
        <p>When he and his wife journey once or twice a month from their home in Connecticut to their farm in southern Virginia, they do not drive for an hour to La Guardia Airport, check in themselves, their baggage and their three dogs an hour before the 90-minute flight and arrive at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina, the nearest to their farm that the airliners from New York land.</p>
        <p>Instead, they drive just 20 minutes to the Westchester County Airport and immediately board a sleek, seven-passenger Cessna Citation light jet that carries them to an airfield closer to the farm.</p>
        <p>''It adds up to three hours door to door,'' Mr. Kinnear said in a recent interview, two hours less than the trip by scheduled carrier, and without the worry about the dogs' riding in a cargo hold. Harnessed securely and sleeping on the floor, they, too, ride in the cabin of the Cessna, in which Mr. Kinnear has a one-eighth share, or fractional ownership.</p>
        <p>Such arrangements were pioneered in the 1980's by the company that sold him his share, Executive Jet Inc., of Woodbridge, N.J., but most of the growth in such ownership has come in the last three or four years.</p>
        <p>Then there is Bill Rosenthal, the president of KaplanCollege.com, an online school that offers courses for career advancement. He flies two or three times a week on business, using scheduled airlines, usually riding in coach class. But recently, he had his first chew of charter flying, and the taste was great, he said of the single-day trip between his New York base and Atlanta.</p>
        <p>He said it emphasized for him two big advantages of chartering: more time for work in the city he was visiting and less time getting there and back.</p>
        <p>''I knew I could be with my customer till the last minute,'' Mr. Rosenthal said, noting that he did not have to arrive at the airport 45 minutes before his flight's departure and had a quicker drive to the charter plane's field. No less satisfying was the fact that the time saved in ground travel and airport waiting totaled three hours round trip.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rosenthal also said that despite these advantages, he did not know whether charter flying could be more than a rarity in his regimen. He did it on the Atlanta trip, he said, because he found a bargain $998 round trip being offered at the time by a new company that is seeking to build an Internet business arranging individual seats on charter flights.</p>
        <p>The fare, which was being offered by flightserv.com to attract customers, brought the cost close to that for a business-class ticket on a trip arranged on short notice on an airline, Mr. Rosenthal said.</p>
        <p>He said that in working for a business on a tight budget, he would fly charter again ''in a heartbeat'' if the price were within 10 or 15 percent of an airline's fare for the same trip, but ''above 15 percent, I'd have to give it a a lot of thought, and over 25, 30 percent, I can't justify it.''</p>
        <p>While hard-and-fast figures on charter flying are difficult to come by -- the Federal Aviation Administration lumps charter flights with commuter airline flights -- charter operators and those who follow the business say chartering in the United States has been on the upswing in the last few years.</p>
        <p>''It's grown about 7 percent in revenues and flights in the last year or so,'' said Fred Gevalt, publisher of the Air Charter Guide, a listing of charter operators and their planes and prices. He said charter flying in the country had shown no growth for years before that.</p>
        <p>Susan Bopp, the owner of Air Charters Inc., a six-plane fleet based at Teterboro Airport, said that after being down earlier in the 1990's, her business was ''about 20 percent up over two years ago.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Helms of TAG Aviation, whose Geneva-based international operations include nearly 150 planes in the United States, said that the company's business in this country had not been caught in any downdrafts over the last decade, its charter hours flown having steadily risen.</p>
        <p>Clifton Stroud, a spokesman for the National Air Transportation Association, which represents hundreds of the approximately 3,000 charter companies that he estimates exist in the country, said that many manufacturing companies with plants far from big airports found it ''more direct and efficient'' to charter flights for visiting executives than to have them connect to commuter flights or drive from the big airfields.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gevalt said that while chartering ''has been typically 80 to 85 percent business trips,'' personal-travel charters were becoming more visible. ''It's a lot easier to see people get off with golf clubs, skis and a couple of kids and the family dog, more so than in the past,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Helms said that personal travel had gone from 10 to 25 percent of TAG Aviation's charters in the last decade.</p>
        <p>Generalizing about the comparative costs of chartering and using airlines is difficult because of a number of variables: the differing aircraft and prices charter companies offer, the size of charter groups, which affect the cost per person, and the airlines' intricate fare schedules.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gevalt, for example, said a typical business trip -- ''out and back in a day, two and a half hours flying each way'' -- could cost $1,200 to $1,500 an hour for craft and crew, or $6,000 to $7,500 for the day.</p>
        <p>With a group of five, that would be $1,200 to $1,500 a person, which he said was not far from what they might pay on a scheduled line in first or business class, or even in coach ''if it's a last-minute trip.''</p>
        <p>Delta Airlines, asked recently for the round-trip fare for a roughly comparable single-day trip that would be made the next day -- New York to Atlanta, about four and a half hours in the air round trip -- quoted a $1,499 first-class fare and a $931 coach cost, though a return later at night dropped the round-trip coach ticket to $569.</p>
        <p>In some examples, a large enough charter group brought the cost per traveler below an airline's first-class price.</p>
        <p>Clearly, however, many who charter are not concerned with comparison shopping.</p>
        <p>''The average we charter costs $2,600 to $3,000 an hour,'' said Ms. Helms of TAG Aviation. At $3,000, the cost of a five-and-half-hour round trip on a one-day journey to Miami would total about $18,000, with taxes and fees, or $3,600 a person for a group of five.</p>
        <p>If they returned the next day, there would be a total of $500 more to put up the crew for the night, and a more extended stay would add much heftier minimum daily fees -- indicating, Ms. Helms said, that charters are most economical for short trips.</p>
        <p>The May 21 crash of a charter plane near Wilkes-Barre, Pa., in which 19 people died, has focused attention on the safety of charter flights. The accident rate for such flights has consistently been higher than that for flights on scheduled airlines, according to National Transportation Safety Board records going back to 1982. Accidents that year involving charters totaled 4.39 per 100,000 flight hours, compared with 0.22 for the airlines; in 1999, the rate was 2.71 for the charters and 0.29 for the airlines.</p>
        <p>Charter business groups said the higher charter rates were mainly attributable to crashes involving piston-powered propeller planes, whose engines they said were probably less reliable than the turbine engines that power jets and turboprops. They held this to be true even though the plane in the Pennsylvania crash, operated by Executive Airlines of Farmingdale, N.Y., was a turboprop.</p>
        <p>According to David Almy, a vice president of the National Business Aviation Association, there are more than 2,700 fractional-share owners in the country. Executive Jet, whose chairman, Richard T. Santulli, came up with the concept, says nearly 1,800 of them are in its program.</p>
        <p>It currently costs $835,000 under the Executive Jet program to buy a one-eighth share in a seven-passenger Cessna Citation V Ultra, the kind of jet in which Mr. Kinnear, the retired Texaco chief, has a share. That plus $7,900 a month in management fees and $1,275 for each hour the owner flies buys 100 hours a year in the air, said Kevin Russell, an Executive Jet spokesman.</p>
        <p>But there really is no need for jaw-dropping, Mr. Russell said. An owner can always sell the share and recoup as much of the purchase cost as the market affords, he said. Of the other costs, he said, ''We tell people that if you fly less than 50 hours a year but want access to a private jet, you should probably charter, but if you fly more than 50 hours a year and your trips are extended beyond two or three days, you should investigate fractional ownership.''</p>
