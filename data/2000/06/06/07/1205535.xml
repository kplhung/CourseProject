        <p>The baseball paths of John Rocker and Mark Wohlers first crossed in May 1998. Wohlers, the Atlanta Braves' closer, went on the disabled list, and Rocker was recalled from Richmond to replace him on the roster. Three weeks later, Wohlers rejoined the Braves, Rocker remained and the two briefly were teammates. Two years later, they are opponents, pitching in the International League.</p>
        <p>What an unlikely development, not to mention coincidence, but there they are, Wohlers relieving for the Louisville Riverbats, on his way back to the major leagues, his control seemingly restored; Rocker on his way to pitch for the Richmond Braves, demoted to the minor leagues, having lost control of his pitches and his behavior.</p>
        <p>At least some, if not most, of the members of the Braves would be happy if Rocker were never to rejoin them. On the other hand, they are rooting for Wohlers to make it back, even if it is with the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
        <p>''Wohlers would be the consensus guy,'' a general manager of another team said yesterday, commenting on the feelings about each reliever.</p>
        <p>Wohlers's former teammates, as well as other players, pull for him because he has always been a good person, a good guy, and he was the victim of a mystifying loss of control of his pitches. En route to a brilliant career as a closer, Wohlers suddenly couldn't throw strikes. A performance that produced 97 saves over three seasons deteriorated into one that created 33 walks in 20 1/3 innings in 1998.</p>
        <p>A similar performance of 25 walks in 18 1/3 innings created cover for the Braves to send Rocker to the minors, giving him time for a refresher course on the strike zone and a more important course on behavior in life. Had Wohlers not lost the strike zone and forced the Braves to replace him, first with Kerry Ligtenberg, then with Rocker, Rocker would not have been in a position to take on New York's baiting fans last season, then the world in a magazine interview last winter.</p>
        <p>But while Rocker's world is an unappetizing place to live, the new world Wohlers has discovered is filled with fresh and sweet-smelling air. Wohlers's agent, Seth Levinson, told yesterday of the delight with which his client related details of his performance of the previous night. With a 2-1 count on the Scranton-Wilkes Barre cleanup hitter, Wohlers threw a 96 mile-an-hour fastball on the black on one side of the plate, then fired another 96 mile-an-hour fastball on the black on the other side.</p>
        <p>The 30-year-old Wohlers, nearing the end of his rehabilitation from so-called Tommy John elbow surgery 11 months ago, was making his first appearance for Class AAA Louisville after three outings for Class A Dayton. The Reds, who use relief pitchers like chain smokers use cigarettes, eagerly await his arrival in Cincinnati. Before they make the move, though, the Reds want to see Wohlers relieve in consecutive games.</p>
        <p>''That could be another 10 days, a week; they haven't put any definite timetable on it,'' the pitcher told The Louisville Courier-Journal. ''And it depends on how I do. There are a lot of good hitters in this league. You can't just come down here, think you're going to get your arm in shape and go straight up to the big leagues. You have to prove yourself at each level you're at. I just want to stay healthy and throw strikes, no matter where I'm at.''</p>
        <p>Rocker would do well to heed Wohler's words. If he approaches his appearances with Richmond with the angry attitude with which he seemed to have departed from the Atlanta clubhouse Monday, he could set back the nonexistent timetable the Braves have for his return to their clubhouse. Now what a shame that would be.</p>
        <p>It is premature to talk about Wohlers's return to the majors; he has suffered too many setbacks in his two-year effort to jump ahead of his schedule.</p>
        <p>Throwing at speeds up to 97 m.p.h. in his appearance on Monday, Wohlers threw strikes on 10 of his 18 pitches, struck out two batters, walked one and gave up one hit. Dave Miley, the Louisville manager, said Wohlers ''threw the heck out of the ball.'' The pitcher's only concern, he said, was his inability to throw his slider where he wanted it.</p>
        <p>''Right now,'' he said, ''I feel like it's a matter of getting my slider going. I threw a couple good sliders for guys to swing and miss, but not good for being in the strike zone. That's the one pitch giving me a little bit of trouble right now. That's something that will come with time.''</p>
        <p>Wohlers is not prepared to talk in depth about his problems and his comeback, his agent said. He has not proved anything yet. He wants to know he's back before he talks about getting back. But how delightful it would be to have Wohlers pitching in relief for the Reds, saving games for the Reds. He has worked hard to make it back.</p>
        <p>Rocker's work has only begun. But then, he hasn't shown that he wants to work at changing the attitude that created his problems.</p>
