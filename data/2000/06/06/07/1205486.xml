      <block class="full_text">
        <p>You are the chief executive of a company whose stock has lost 84 percent of its value in less than two years, a major stockholder is agitating for your ouster and the business partner responsible for nearly half of your company's revenues wants to end the relationship. What do you do now?</p>
        <p>Linda J. Wachner, chief executive of the Warnaco Group, faces just such a test.</p>
        <p>When Calvin Klein Inc. filed a lawsuit last week to free itself from a licensing agreement that generates a crucial chunk of Warnaco's $2.1 billion in revenues, Warnaco's share price sank to a nadir of $6.35, well off its 1998 high of $44. And Mr. Klein, whose complaints were unusually personal, put Ms. Wachner squarely on the defensive.</p>
        <p>So far, Warnaco's board has not shown serious displeasure with Ms. Wachner -- it paid her more than $7 million in stock and salary last year though it did withhold her bonus. But since the company posted a disappointing quarterly report in May, pressure has been building for some type of change. Leon G. Cooperman, who owns almost 7 percent of Warnaco privately and through his money management firm Omega Advisors, sent a scathing letter last month to Warnaco's board blaming Ms. Wachner for the company's problems.</p>
        <p>''Warnaco has seen its stock trashed for reasons that are neither transient nor forgivable, including management's loss of credibility,'' he wrote, while demanding a meeting with the board.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooperman, who was furious that the contents of his letter were being made public, refused to comment on whether he was actively seeking Ms. Wachner's replacement.</p>
        <p>Warnaco says it stands behind its chief executive. ''The board is fully supportive of Ms. Wachner and the Warnaco senior management team and their strategy,'' a spokesman for the company said. Besides, the driven Ms. Wachner, who has been called ''abusive'' in the Calvin Klein lawsuit, is considered the pit bull of the garment industry, and even her detractors do not count her out, noting how deftly she has outmaneuvered past opponents.</p>
        <p>This time, her likely first line of defense will be to try to persuade the court to dismiss the Klein suit, which she calls frivolous. Mr. Klein, though, has landed the law firm of Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner, which represented the Justice Department in its antitrust suit against Microsoft, and poses a serious threat that will not be swifly vanquished. Much in demand, David Boies said he joined the Klein suit not because of special connections, but because it interested him. (The surrounding publicity probably won't hurt his law firm either.)</p>
        <p>In any case, the highly regarded Mr. Boies predicts that the lawsuit is not going to evaporate quickly. ''It is inevitable that some part will go to trial,'' he said, ''and the trial will be sometime next year.''</p>
        <p>Not one to be bested, Ms. Wachner has just recruited her own high-profile legal team. ''We have retained Williams &amp; Connolly to represent us in the Calvin Klein litigation,'' a company spokesman said yesterday. ''Brendan Sullivan will personally litigate the case and the team will also include Nicole Seligman and Gregory B. Craig.'' Ms. Seligman is one of President Clinton's private lawyers. Mr. Craig, who was enlisted by President Clinton to coordinate his legal and political defense against impeachment charges, is currently representing Juan Miguel Gonzalez, father of Elian. But clashing superlawyers tend to lengthen litigation, not shorten it.</p>
        <p>Another option for Ms. Wachner is to take advantage of the incredibly low stock price and rid herself of complaining investors by taking the company private. In an interview last week, Ms. Wachner insisted she had no interest in such action right now. But with the stock trading at $7.3125, the company's market value is a paltry $400 million, very attractive indeed considering that last year's net income was almost $100 million. Ms. Wachner and Warnaco had no comment.</p>
        <p>''At some point, that has to be something they will look at,'' said Christine Kilton-Augustine who follows the stock for ING Barings. ''They have done a leveraged buyout before successfully, and she has proven that she is not uncomfortable running with a lot of debt.'' (Mrs. Wachner led a group that bought Warnaco in a hostile leveraged buyout in 1986 and took it public in 1991).</p>
        <p>Warnaco's debt has ballooned in the last year because of its acquisition of Authentic Fitness, but the company's cash flow is still solid.</p>
        <p>At the least, Ms. Wachner has to find a way to perform up to expectations. When Ms. Wachner took over Warnaco in 1986, she pulled off a textbook turnaround, transforming a sleepy bra maker with $400 million in annual revenue into the $2.1 billion apparel giant it is today. But last year, top-line growth of the core Warnaco business sputtered at 3.8 percent, Ms. Kilton-Augustine said. More maddening to Wall Street, on several recent occasions the company has guided Wall Street analysts far from the mark on earnings. Just last quarter, with First Call putting analysts' estimates at 41 cents a share, Ms. Wachner delivered just 11 cents a share in earnings.</p>
        <p>Hitting the full-year estimate could give the stock a big boost, but it won't be easy. Last year, Warnaco was plagued by troubles in its junior jeans-wear division and lost nearly 1,000 outlets as bankruptcy claimed clients like Filene's, T. Eaton and Loehmann's. Ms. Wachner is spending a lot of time trying to turn around the juniors business and has pinned hopes on reviving growth through recently acquired brands like ABS by Allen B. Schwartz and Speedo.</p>
        <p>But with the economy slowing at least a bit from its feverish pace and retail sales beginning to ease as well, she may have trouble delivering.</p>
        <p>Finally, Warnaco could strike a deal with one of its many suitors, most notably the VF Corporation, the maker of Lee, which is particularly interested in adding an upscale jeans brand to its stable.</p>
        <p>VF has made friendly overtures in Warnaco's direction for some time, but is disinclined to make a hostile deal. A friendly deal would probably require Ms. Wachner to move on voluntarily.</p>
