        <p>It could finally be Martina Hingis's year at the French Open. It could again be Gustavo Kuerten's or Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario's year. It could even be Mary Pierce's.</p>
        <p>But what is certain after an overstuffed afternoon of quarterfinal action today is that it will not be an American's year.</p>
        <p>For the first time in 33 years, no American man or woman will take part in the semifinals of the world's premier clay-court tournament.</p>
        <p>Monica Seles, Venus Williams and Chanda Rubin were all beaten today, and the crushed red brick at Roland Garros has been left to the Spanish, the Swiss, the Brazilians and, technically speaking at least, the French.</p>
        <p>Pierce spends a great deal more time these days with her baseball-playing boyfriend, Roberto Alomar, in Cleveland or in her house in Florida than she does in France, the country she began representing as a teenager.</p>
        <p>But despite the ambivalence of the Paris crowd toward her in recent years, and despite her increasing need to search for her words in the language of Voltaire and Yannick Noah, Pierce continues to catch the long flight across the Atlantic to play at home.</p>
        <p>Pierce earned one of the most significant victories of her career by defeating Monica Seles, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.</p>
        <p>The sixth-seeded Pierce will face top-seeded Martina Hingis in the semifinals Thursday. Hingis was too versatile and too poised for the unseeded Rubin in their quarterfinal, winning, 6-1, 6-3.</p>
        <p>The Swiss player is now two victories from the only Grand Slam title she is missing and clearly wary, after last year's public relations disaster against Steffi Graf in the final, about appearing too eager.</p>
        <p>''I need oxygen probably to survive, but not the French Open,'' Hingis said today.</p>
        <p>The other semifinal Thursday will be an all-Spanish affair between Sanchez-Vicario and Conchita Martinez, two 28-year-old veterans. Although they were expected to be washed away by the new wave of talent, both have proved to be surprisingly resistant to erosion.</p>
        <p>Sanchez-Vicario, seeded eighth, proved too consistent and resourceful down the stretch today for the fourth-seeded Williams, changing speeds and tactics regularly in her 6-0, 1-6, 6-2 victory. The fifth-seeded Martinez later shrugged off a set point in the opening set before eliminating yet another Spaniard, the 17-year-old qualifier Marta Marrero, 7-6 (5), 6-1.</p>
        <p>The last time Williams and Sanchez-Vicario met on clay was last year in Hamburg, Germany. Williams won, 6-1, 6-3, and had beaten her four times in a row in all, but after a four-month layoff because of tendinitis in her wrists, her level has slipped considerably.</p>
        <p>Williams is not as consistent from the baseline and not as confident a returner on big points. She also does not seem quite as fit -- it's tough to look intimidating when you are gasping for air -- and is not serving as effectively.</p>
        <p>Watching her serve at the moment is akin to watching a Ferrari with a two-stroke engine: it looks impressive until it tries to accelerate. The 6-foot-1-inch Williams finished with only two service winners; the 5-6 1/2 Sanchez-Vicario had six.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem remains her imperfect technique, but Williams attributes the problem to not practicing her serve until recently because of her sore right wrist.</p>
        <p>''I think Arantxa's lifted up her level a lot, but then it's also in conjunction with the level of my game not being anywhere near normal in my opinion,'' Williams said.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Sanchez-Vicario came back to beat Williams's sister, Serena, in an ill-tempered match on the same court in the fourth round en route to her third title here.</p>
        <p>''I thought about that,'' Venus Williams said. ''Different match, different year, different circumstances.''</p>
        <p>Kuerten, the skinny Brazilian with the muscular ground strokes, had a great year here in 1997, emerging from obscurity in a big hurry to win. But everybody knows Guga now at Roland Garros, and today he moved one step closer to his second title by defeating another former champion, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, in the quarterfinals in five draining and thoroughly diverting sets, 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.</p>
        <p>His task will not necessarily be easier in the semifinals against 20-year-old Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain, who eliminated his more experienced, more expansive but not quite as complete countryman Alex Corretja by the confidence-boosting score of 6-4, 6-4, 6-2.</p>
        <p>In fourth-round matches suspended because of darkness and rain on Monday, Franco Squillari of Argentina finished off 14th-seeded Younes el-Aynaoui of Morocco, 6-4, 6-1, 6-3, to reach his first Grand Slam quarterfinal. Squillari was one of only 12 Argentinians when the tournament began; now he is alone and benefiting greatly from the slower-than-usual conditions this year.</p>
        <p>Albert Costa of Spain, long an underachiever here, is benefiting, too, and he earned a date with Squillari by finishing off the Australian teenager Lleyton Hewitt, 6-3, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4.</p>
        <p>But the men's match of the day was unquestionably Kafelnikov versus Kuerten. On the brink of defeat in the fourth set with Kafelnikov up, 4-2, with the score 40-15 on his own serve, the Brazilian won the next four points to break the Russian's serve and then watched with mild surprise and growing delight as Kafelnikov progressively lost his edge.</p>
        <p>''I had the match in my hands; I just basically gave it away,'' Kafelnikov said.</p>
        <p>Kuerten did not disagree.</p>
        <p>''I think that everybody could see that I was having tough moments there,'' he said. ''Someone helped me. I don't know who, but someone.''</p>
