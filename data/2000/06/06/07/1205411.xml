        <p>The atmosphere was as electric as ever at the School of American Ballet's 36th Annual Workshop Performance benefit on Monday night at the Juilliard Theater. So much has been accomplished, and there is still so far to go for the young dancers, students at the school, affiliated with New York City Ballet.</p>
        <p>The ballets, also performed with different casts on Saturday afternoon and evening, made few allowances for youth and nerves. The lead dancers, Ellen Green and Amar Ramasar, sailed through Balanchine's knotty but ebullient ''Danses Concertantes,'' set to a Stravinsky score and staged by Susan Pilarre. Ms. Green gave the choreography a nicely indolent spin. Mr. Ramasar, a workshop favorite last spring, has gained immensely in control and polish without losing any of his endearing eagerness.</p>

        <p>The atmosphere was as electric as ever at the School of American Ballet's 36th Annual Workshop Performance benefit on Monday night at the Juilliard Theater. So much has been accomplished, and there is still so far to go for the young dancers, students at the school, affiliated with New York City Ballet.</p>
        <p>The ballets, also performed with different casts on Saturday afternoon and evening, made few allowances for youth and nerves. The lead dancers, Ellen Green and Amar Ramasar, sailed through Balanchine's knotty but ebullient ''Danses Concertantes,'' set to a Stravinsky score and staged by Susan Pilarre. Ms. Green gave the choreography a nicely indolent spin. Mr. Ramasar, a workshop favorite last spring, has gained immensely in control and polish without losing any of his endearing eagerness.</p>
        <p>''Konservatoriet,'' an excerpt from a ballet by August Bournonville set to music by H. S. Paulli, offers a confectionary look at a ballet class at the mid-19th-century Paris Conservatory. Two women, Elisa and Victorine, are vestiges of a complicated romantic plot: they compete for the teacher's attention through their dancing.</p>
        <p>In a lead cast that danced at all three performances, Glenn Keenan brought a serene strength and supple technique to Elisa. Charlene Cohen was an adorable Victorine, a flighty little Degas ballet girl with a pretty Bournonville upper torso. Andrew Veyette, the ballet master, was properly stern but had trouble with the demanding male solo. Julia Cherlow stood out for the piquancy of her dancing in the corps.</p>
        <p>Ms. Keenan led the first campaign imposingly but somewhat blandly in Balanchine's ''Stars and Stripes,'' danced to Sousa march music orchestrated by Hershy Kay. Ashley Maher embodied the ballet's cheeky innocence at the head of the second campaign, recovering from a terrible spill with a star's aplomb.</p>
        <p>Daniel Ulbricht and his regiment of men had the audience cheering on Saturday night in the third campaign, roles they repeated on Monday. Here and in ''Danses Concertantes'' on both nights Mr. Ulbricht stood out for his exuberant performing and confident technique. And Ashley Bouder and Mr. Veyette were a witty delight on Saturday night as the leads in the fourth campaign, roles they repeated on Monday.</p>
        <p>Also on Saturday night Sean Suozzi stood out for his expansiveness and ease in ''Danses Concertantes,'' performed with a minxlike Ms. Cohen as his ballerina. Carly Sebouhian and Amy Watson led the first and second campaigns in ''Stars and Stripes'' with slightly scrappy verve.</p>
        <p>Monday's benefit opened with the naming of this year's recipients of the school's Mae L. Wien Awards. The award for distinguished teaching went to Marina Stavitskaya. Student prizes for outstanding promise went to Ms. Bouder, Ms. Keenan, Mr. Ramasar and Mr. Veyette, all of whom will join City Ballet as apprentices in the fall.</p>
