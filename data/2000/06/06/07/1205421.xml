        <p>Each year, there are fewer people to handle the many complex matters that come before a district -- student achievement, multimillion-dollar budgets, management of buildings and state mandates. School board members do not usually have expertise in these areas before they begin their service. They rely on a staff that is shrinking as the range of issues needing decision is increasing.</p>
        <p>It is time to recognize that running a school system is at least as complex as running a business and devote the resources necessary to do the job.</p>
