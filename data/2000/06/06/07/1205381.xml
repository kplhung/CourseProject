        <p>I DON'T know about you, but I don't like to think much about underwear. I always found it disturbing when people said you had to have nice underthings on every day, in case you were hit by a bus and had to be taken to a hospital, where an utter stranger might witness your tattered skivvies.</p>
        <p>Call me crazy, but what I was wearing, should I need to be carried somewhere on a stretcher, seemed low on the list of Things to Lose Sleep Over.</p>
        <p>Of course, as I grew up, I learned there were other reasons that would make a woman attend to her underlayer. But even they haven't made lingerie one of my raisons d'etre. Heck, I'm not even into shoes.</p>
        <p>This is why, for me, the idea of buying underwear online -- buying anything online, really -- is so appealing. I can do it when I want without going out of my way; I can do it fast; and I feel as if I'm getting a present in the mail as a bonus for my trouble.</p>
        <p>It turns out that I'm not alone. The grande dame of underwear and hosiery manufacturers, Sara Lee, which makes Hanes, Bali, Playtex, Wonderbra and other well-known brands, reports that online sales have tripled in the last year. And it sells only irregulars and discontinued styles on the Web.</p>
        <p>But that doesn't mean that the intimate-apparel shoppers of the world are flocking to Web sites in such numbers that the lingerie clerks at the department stores are standing around like Maytag repairmen.</p>
        <p>However, Rachel Strasser, the vice president for business development at the Web business Figleaves.com, is banking that some day soon, they will be.</p>
        <p>Figleaves.com, which opened in March, is all about what the apparel industry calls ''essential wear'' -- a niche Ms. Strasser said she and her colleagues focused on after first considering a broader plan to get into the online apparel business.</p>
        <p>She ticked off a list of reasons she contended had made underwear and hosiery a workable business on the Web: ''You can't try packaged underwear on in the stores, anyway. People often know what size they wear. The only way to reorder is to go to the department store. Upscale brands are primarily sold in department stores, but they don't have as extensive a selection because square footage is limited on the selling floor -- both from a style and size perspective.''</p>
        <p>In the short time that Figleaves.com's virtual doors have been open, Ms. Strasser added, she has discovered another benefit to the medium: it attracts men. While women buy 75 percent of the underwear sold over the counter, online shoppers at her site are, so far, evenly divided between the sexes, according to her analysis of credit card transactions.</p>
        <p>Not all online underwear shoppers, though, are after hassle-free shopping.</p>
        <p>For Christine Butler, the Web is a lifeline to her favorite underwear store. When her family was relocated to London from Chicago, she was worried about losing access to Victoria's Secret. The company, based in Columbus, Ohio, has 900 stores in the United States, but does not have any abroad, nor does it plan to open any.</p>
        <p>It does, however, have a Web site, which has been open for business since December 1998. Since then, the site has attracted buyers from 137 countries, said Anne Marie Blaire, the director of Internet brand development for Intimate Brands, Victoria's Secret's parent company.</p>
        <p>Victoria's Secret executives are also aware that their catalogs are famous as entertainment as well as sources of information, and they are trying to capitalize on that success online. Last month, the company held its second online fashion show, a live video recording from Cannes, France, during which viewers could click on a model's garment and place it in a virtual shopping cart. The first show, advertised just once, during the Super Bowl in 1999, got so much traffic that the servers broke, a gaffe that the company saw as a sign of success.</p>
        <p>Video specials are one way Intimate Brands intends to use the Victoria's Secret site. Visitors to the site can sign up for memberships, which entitle them to announcements by e-mail messages. There is  also an interactive bra finder, which allows buyers to specify a particular bra need (i.e., strapless) and find a product to match it.</p>
        <p>''It's fun for the customer,'' Ms. Blaire said, adding that it was also an easy way to indulge in a guilty pleasure.</p>
        <p>''What's the ultimate pick-me-up for a girl?'' she asked. ''It's lingerie or a lipstick.  It makes you feel pampered and indulged.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Butler, the expatriate Victoria's Secret shopper, had a baby recently, and wanted to treat herself to ''some pretty p.j.'s and lingerie,'' she said. Without the Web site, she would have had her sisters send her catalogs, place her orders and then bring the goods on their next visit. This way, she skips those steps.</p>
        <p>''It was a great way to get the things I liked without the hassle,'' she said in an e-mail interview.</p>
        <p>Even a lingerie Luddite like me knows that Victoria's Secret is not for everyone. Susan, my friend and lingerie adviser, who declined to be identified by her last name, emphasized this as we discussed bras and panties on the phone from our workplaces.</p>
        <p>Hearing Susan wax rhapsodic about underwear is enough to make even a colorless plain-cotton gal want to rush out and expand her collection.</p>
        <p>But would Susan buy this stuff online? She ruminated over this serious question as we both called up Figleaves.com, a site she had not seen yet.</p>
        <p>''As a bra shopper, I generally buy the same stuff over and over,'' she said. ''It's a little nerve-racking, but I guess you could do it'' online, she added. ''But I don't think most women would feel comfortable buying a new brand online. Bras are so individual. I kind of like to touch them.''</p>
        <p>If the online purchases didn't fit, she reasoned, she could send them back. But then she remembered merchandise she had bought from a catalog months ago, which had been sitting under her desk, waiting to be returned.</p>
        <p>She confessed, however, that despite her misgivings about online clothes shopping, she liked the look of Figleaves.com, as well as the brands it offered.</p>
        <p>''You still don't know what they feel like,''  she said. ''Oh, DKNY. Let's go see that.''</p>
        <p>The brand name lured Susan, as Ms. Strasser had hoped. Susan was particularly enamored of an underwire bra that could be converted to strapless. ''It's hard to find a good strapless bra,'' she said. But she worried about size.</p>
        <p>I pointed out that Figleaves.com offered  customer service online with the click of a mouse. Seconds later, a representative who called herself Eve responded vaguely to Susan's query about what size DKNY bra she might need.</p>
        <p>Despite her skepticism, Susan found her mind filled with possibilities. ''I could see how you could get addicted,'' she said. ''If I buy a new bra and panties, I feel so much better. It's like buying new barrettes.''</p>
        <p>Inspired, I bought the strapless bra and matching panties for myself -- in case a bus did make unwanted contact with my body, of course.</p>
        <p>They turned out to be so nice that I'm thinking of having a new set shipped every three months.</p>
        <p>To Reorder Online, Pick A Specialty</p>
        <p>AH, for the days of the milkman, when an empty bottle on the porch was the only signal needed to guarantee a fresh supply. Reordering replenishable products seems to be a task for which the World Wide Web is ideal, since it requires only the entry and storage of information.</p>
        <p>But even though the concept of automatic replenishment is seen as a kind of holy grail by some -- assuring that no one will have to leave the house to buy aspirin or corn flakes again -- few e-commerce sites have  exploited this business.</p>
        <p>Those that have are limited to specialty items, like www.harryand david.com by Harry and David, the produce supplier in Medford, Ore, which allows shoppers to order fruit, vegetables and plants on a schedule.</p>
        <p>This month, DansChocolates.com, a Web-based sweet shop with headquarters in Watertown, Mass., will add a feature that it calls personalization, which allows customers to schedule regular orders. TheCondomClub.com already offers a monthly shipment of 15 condoms for $14. Water.com is as close to the milkman as could be found in this unscientific survey, but the service does not yet deliver nationwide.</p>
        <p>If an online store has a product you want replenished, you might ask if it will accommodate you regularly. The proprietors of Tea-time.com, for instance, said a customer could e-mail a request and fax a credit card number to establish a schedule.</p>
        <p>Clubs offering a rotating variation of a product actually abound on the Web. The Candle of the Month Club, at www.astronomicalgifts.com, promises a 40-hour candle each month for six months for $95. Calyx and Corolla, a florist located at  www.calyxandcorolla.com is just one site that offers a year of flowers, at a cost of $385. Wine.com is among a number of wine clubs that will send a new bottle each month.</p>
        <p>Other sites keep digital lists of items you frequently buy. They include Clinique.com, Staples.com, Figleaves.com and Drugstore.com. As for milk itself, there is www.milkman.com, a site promoting the boxed milk product Parmalat. For regular deliveries, it redirects visitors to Netgrocer.com.</p>
