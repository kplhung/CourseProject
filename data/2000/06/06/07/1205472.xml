        <p>Joe Roth, the former head of Walt Disney Studios, has obtained backing for his new movie company from Sony Pictures, the Starz Encore Group and Fox Entertainment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth said the three backers would put in $250 million for a combined equity stake of just less than 25 percent in the company, Revolution Studios. But the three companies, plus other partners in Germany and Japan, have committed themselves to finance both the production and marketing costs of at least 36 movies that Revolution Studios plans to make in the next six years. That would bring the total financial commitment to about $3 billion, he said.</p>

        <p>Joe Roth, the former head of Walt Disney Studios, has obtained backing for his new movie company from Sony Pictures, the Starz Encore Group and Fox Entertainment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth said the three backers would put in $250 million for a combined equity stake of just less than 25 percent in the company, Revolution Studios. But the three companies, plus other partners in Germany and Japan, have committed themselves to finance both the production and marketing costs of at least 36 movies that Revolution Studios plans to make in the next six years. That would bring the total financial commitment to about $3 billion, he said.</p>
        <p>Sony will gain the movie and home video distribution rights in the United States and overseas except in Germany and Japan. Starz Encore, a pay television company that is part of Liberty Media Group, will receive domestic rights for pay television. Fox, which is controlled by News Corporation, will have other United States television rights.</p>
        <p>Because of his track record at the helm of Disney Studios, leading it to the top position at the box office in five of his six years, Mr. Roth gained concessions that few other independent producers have. He will have autonomy to choose films and the budgets. And Revolution Studios will retain ownership of the movies, putting it in position to benefit from new ways of distributing movies in the future. ''No one really knows what the future is going to be and it's best to be in control of it,'' Mr. Roth, 51, said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth has two partners in Revolutio: Rob Moore, the former executive vice president for operations and finance at Walt Disney Studios, and Todd Garner, former co-president of the Walt Disney Motion Picture Group. Revolution will make three pictures starring Julia Roberts and four produced by Adam Sandler. Revolution's first movie, which should appear next year, will be ''Tomcats,'' a teenage-oriented comedy starring Jerry O'Connell, Shannon Elizabeth and Jake Busey.</p>
        <p>The company, based in Santa Monica, Calif., has also purchased controlling interest in an Internet company, MediaTrip.com.</p>
