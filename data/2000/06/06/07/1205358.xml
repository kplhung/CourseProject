        <p>MORE than 400 years ago, a warlord named Nobunaga Oda revolutionized the Japanese marketplace by taking control of the powerful trade associations and throwing it open to all would-be merchants for a nominal flat fee.</p>
        <p>The rules of the open market were so radical and so popular that central Japan, Oda's stronghold, became the dominant center of commerce in Japan for a while, and the name of his revolutionary policy, ''rakuichi to rakuza,'' which means ''free markets and free guilds,'' still resonates with Japanese.</p>
        <p>Hiroshi Mikitani certainly had Oda-San in mind when he named Rakuten, now Japan's largest e-commerce site. Operating an online bazaar under virtually the same principles that underpinned Oda's marketplace, www.rakuten.co.jp draws about 95 million hits a month as a gateway to about 2,800 merchants around the country selling everything from eggs to kimonos.</p>
        <p>''I want Rakuten to be the best place to sell anything,'' said Mr. Mikitani, who founded the site three years ago. ''The marketplace is what we focus on, the exchange between buyers and sellers, while most others focus on being a shop or a collection of shops.''</p>
        <p>Merchants pay 50,000 yen a month, or about $469, to link their Web sites to Rakuten. In exchange, they receive tips on jazzing up those sites and access to Rakuten's database and software, which contain information about customers and their predilections. Rakuten also offers them low-cost advertising. ''We are basically a bricks-and-mortar business because all of our stores are real bricks-and-mortar stores,'' Mr. Mikitani said, although most of Rakuten's customers never set foot in those shops.</p>
        <p>Many of the vendors on Rakuten are established companies looking to pare stale inventory without undercutting sales of their merchandise that is sold at full price. They can put their old inventory online at bargain-basement prices without much risk that the news will reach customers who frequent their stores.</p>
        <p>Other Rakuten vendors are merely trying to overcome Japan's notoriously layered distribution system, or to sell their customers the freshest fish and produce.</p>
        <p>Rakuten has also created a sense of community among its users, who chat online about the virtues and transgressions of Rakuten vendors and can participate in online auctions. The site's Rakuten's Free Market, a sort of mini-eBay, where sellers list items for sale for a fee of 100 yen, or 94 cents, plus 5 percent of the eventual sale price, is often a lively window onto customer preferences.</p>
        <p>The communities that Rakuten creates are important in Japan, where the Internet has taken off largely as a means of social interaction. ''E-commerce here has a much greater social component than in the United States,'' said Jiro Kokuryo, a professor who specializes in the study of information technology and systems at Keio University's business school in Yokohama.</p>
        <p>But it is Rakuten's business model that has made it a darling of investors in the six  weeks since it went public, smack in the middle of a sharp decline in global demand for Internet-related investments. The stock trades on Jasdaq, Japan's over-the-counter market. The decline for Internet stocks was as sharp here as it was in the United States when Rakuten went public; Japanese markets reflect movements in the American markets.</p>
        <p>For one thing, Rakuten has been profitable, earning $1 million on sales of $5.6 million last year. That's an impressive 17.8 percent profit margin, largely unheard of in e-commerce. Mr. Mikitani had the advantage of studying the business models of Amazon.com and eBay, and quickly decided that Rakuten would be much better off as a hybrid, leaning more toward the eBay model than toward Amazon.com.</p>
        <p>Not that he is unimpressed with Amazon .com. He just wants to avoid the costs and liabilities of inventory and distribution. And Rakuten has never advertised. ''We're not really a retail company,'' Mr. Mikitani said. ''We sell retailers the use of our servers, and there's a big difference.'' (In addition to the monthly membership fees, which provide 80 percent of Rakuten's revenue, 10 percent of the revenue comes from advertising and the rest comes from auction.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Mikitani has limited Rakuten's risk by assuming the least liability possible for the business conducted on the site, but he pays attention to customer service. Shops are carefully monitored, and a few have been asked to leave Rakuten for business practices that were considered shady.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mikitani contends that Japan will be a better market for e-commerce than the United States, mostly because of the medium's ability to spark a consumer revolution in a country known for its high prices. In short, the Internet allows merchants to circumvent the many layers of middlemen who clog this country's distribution system, adding costs every time merchandise changes hands.</p>
        <p>For example, if you buy an obi, the sash worn with a kimono, at the retailer Kyoto Kimono Ichiba, it will cost 138,000 yen, or about $1,300. Buy it from Kyoto Kimono's shop on Rakuten, and it costs 13,800 yen, or an affordable $130.</p>
        <p>Or think of it this way, which is Mr. Mikitani's favorite illustration of the power of the Internet here: Buy a share of Rakuten through a traditional Japanese stockbroker, and pay commissions equal to 3 percent of the share's value, which is about 1,065,000 yen at current prices, or $10,000. Buy it online from Monex, a securities broker here, and pay a $10 commission.</p>
        <p>''In the U.S., you use Schwab's online brokerage and you get a price break for sure,'' Mr. Mikitani said. ''But it's not anything like the savings you get in Japan.''</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Mikitani predicted, the Internet ''is going to completely rebuild the Japanese economic system, much more so than in the United States.''</p>
        <p>He also thinks that Japan's more homogeneous population, with its flatter distribution of wealth and stronger sense of community than in the United States, provides the country with e-commerce advantages. ''Japanese people like to communicate with each other, and it's much easier to do that on the Net,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After graduating from Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo, Mr. Mikitani became a banker at the Industrial Bank of Japan, one of the country's most blue-blooded financial institutions.</p>
        <p>He took a break from banking to go to Harvard Business School, returning to the bank in 1993 with a master's of business administration and a newfound respect for entrepreneurship. ''Before I went to business school, I thought my choices were to either work my way up Japanese style to become a director of the bank, or to go into investment banking at a Western firm and make a lot of money,'' Mr. Mikitani said.</p>
        <p>But he opted for a third approach, striking out on his own to become a consultant, which led to his foray into e-commerce.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mikitani toyed with selling educational services, financial advisory services and other things online but chose Rakuten ''because it was scalable,'' which he defined as  requiring lots of technology and relatively little human input. ''I knew I could service 2,800 customers with Rakuten,'' he said. ''Giving 2,800 people financial advice would have been impossible.''</p>
        <p>Rakuten has had no marketing costs so far, although it plans to use some of the $430 million it raised in its stock offering to do  advertising. ''We were lucky,'' Mr. Mikitani said. ''We got famous fast. The first mover always has an advantage, and we were the first mover.''</p>
        <p>That is not to say that others are not moving fast. Curio City, another virtual mall that Mitsui &amp; Company started about the same time that Rakuten opened, has said it plans to increase the number of stores affiliated with its site to 10,000 from the current 800 by the end of this year.</p>
        <p>But out-Rakutening Rakuten is not easy. WomenJapan.com, which offers a forum in which Japanese women can seek out and exchange information and advice about careers, finance, health, entertainment and family issues, experimented with the online bazaar concept at Christmastime.</p>
        <p>The site featured two shops, one selling pashmina wraps and other items, and the other selling wine. Neither vendor was an actual store, and WomenJapan.com found the logistics of distribution and inventory management cumbersome.</p>
        <p>The result? ''E-commerce in Japan is still a big question mark in my mind,'' said Grace Fromm, the chief marketing officer at WomenJapan.com. But WomenJapan .com has not given up on e-commerce. Rather, it took a page from Rakuten's book, signing up two vendors for Mother's Day -- Tower Records and Hibiya Kadan, a well-known Tokyo florist -- that could handle orders on their own.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mikitani's success has made him something of a celebrity, and government officials and politicians seek his advice about e-commerce, although some people worry that the government is more interested in regulating the Internet than in encouraging it. It is worth remembering that free and unfettered markets have been the exception in Japan, not the rule. Nobunaga Oda, after all, committed ritual suicide under threat of assassination by a vassal turned enemy.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mikitani is not afraid. ''What can they do? Shut down a server?'' he asked. ''All you have to do is move the server to the U.S., and you're back in business.''</p>
