        <p>ON Web sites selling to teen-agers, the merchandise often seems like an afterthought.</p>
        <p>First you have to set the mood with music, offer gossipy tidbits about rock stars and actors (just how long will Leo's affair with a model last?) and provide advice, chat rooms and concert information.</p>
        <p>Then you can sell clothing.</p>
        <p>''Who cares about going to anything dot-com and buying a T-shirt?'' said Catherine Kelly, the director of retail operations for Platform Network, a company that sells clothing and CD's to about 250,000 customers worldwide through its funky Web site, Platform.net.</p>
        <p>''It's about the whole culture, the brands that complement each other, the music and what you read,'' Ms. Kelly said.</p>
        <p>Online retailers are finding that clothing that is marketed to young consumers must be placed in the right cultural context; otherwise, it is nothing more than an image floating in digital space.</p>
        <p>Platform and other sites, like Alloy.com, iTurf.com and Hottopic .com, have risen to the top of online apparel sales partly because their sites attract young consumers by other means. Usually, the content is similar to that of magazines directed at teenagers: music reviews, articles about clothing trends and styles, news about teenage idols or, depending on the attire, hip-hop stars. The sites also allow teenagers to chat, offer their opinions about products and content and, in some cases, make their own music or spray graffiti across a virtual wall.</p>
        <p>Just as young people might visit a mall to hang out with friends, linger in a food pavilion and maybe buy a T-shirt, e-commerce specialists say that online clothing purchases by teenagers are driven by similar desires to connect with, and become part of, an identifiable community.</p>
        <p>The message for apparel retailers is simple, explains John P. Flanagan, the president of Integrated Corporate Relations, a communications and consulting firm in Westport, Conn., that specializes in the youth market.</p>
        <p>''A catalog online alone isn't going to sustain an e-commerce site in this demographic,'' Mr. Flanagan said. ''The shopping experience needs to be somewhat more comprehensive and it needs to have content relevant to that consumer.''</p>
        <p>Platform's site has a news section called P-Flash, where teenagers can read about the lives of pop stars -- for example, the rap artist Chuck D's appearance at Congressional hearings about the Internet and music -- as well as interviews with performers like Redman, CD reviews and even horoscopes. But the opportunities to shop are just as abundant. Platform sells 25 brands of clothing, and the companies' profits range from $1,500 a year for an independent T-shirt maker to $1 million a year for big brands like Ecko.</p>
        <p>Hottopic.com, a site linked to 225 stores in 43 states, sells products that are influenced by trends in popular music. For example, when Gwen Stefani, the lead singer of the rock group No Doubt, sports pink hair, Hot Topic may sell pink hair dye.</p>
        <p>To keep teenagers coming back, Hot Topic changes its home page every week, lists information about rock concerts by groups like Nine Inch Nails and Less Than Jake and offers a chat room called Flipoff's Funhouse that, readers are warned, is meant ''for people whose attention spans are short and whose humor has never developed past the rudimentary Three Stooges level.''</p>
        <p>Despite the demands to continuously add new editorial content and to respond quickly to consumer feedback, many sites are vying for a share of the market. That is mostly because profits from online sales to teenagers are expected to grow exponentially.</p>
        <p>Although young people ages 14 to 24 accounted for only about 4 percent of online apparel shoppers in 1999, according to a study by the NPD Group, an international marketing information company based in Port Washington, N.Y., analysts expect that to change dramatically.</p>
        <p>A study by Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm with headquarters in New York, says online shopping by teenagers ages 13 to 18 is expected to total about $300 million this year and is accelerating at about twice the rate of online shopping by adults. By 2003, teenagers are expected to spend about $2 billion annually online.</p>
        <p>''Teens are much more receptive to buying on the Net because they're more comfortable with computers,'' said Betsy McLaughlin, the president of Hot Topic Inc. Despite the relative success of some sites, retailers said teenagers faced two major obstacles when buying apparel online: making sure it fits and paying for it. Although many teenagers tend to purchase baggy clothes, some retailers said fitted clothing was easier to sell to teenagers online than to adults, because junior sizes were more uniform, and most teenagers knew their sizes.</p>
        <p>Payment is more difficult because teenagers who do not have a credit card must rely on alternative payment systems that have not been refined. Analysts expect that services that allow teenagers or their parents to deposit cash in an online account linked to certain merchants will boost sales enormously.</p>
        <p>Despite the challenges, new sites enter the game every day. Hookt .com, a Web site for hip-hop culture that offers music and fashion reviews as well as links to sites where teens can make graffiti art or create  rap beats, will start to sell clothes this month.</p>
        <p>''It's the notion of contextual selling or contextual commerce,'' said Chas B. Walker, one of the company's founders. ''It's only natural that if you're intrigued by our review of a CD or a designer we include on our site, there's an impulse to buy.''</p>
