        <p>DESIGNER fashion, unlike books or CD's, has not been an easy sell on the Web. For starters, there is the sizing and fit challenge -- how do you persuade consumers to buy high-end clothing without trying it on? There is the touch-and-feel problem -- how do you convey the look and texture of new fabrics and materials? Then there are limitations to graphic presentations, conflicts about distributing products and, beyond that, intangible issues like, how do you sell something as ephemeral as style?</p>
        <p>The surprising news is that online apparel sales are increasing, particularly among consumers in their mid-20's to mid-40's. The NPD Group, a market research company in Port Washington, N.Y., reports that Internet apparel sales for 1999 reached $1.1 billion and are expected to double this year. But, at just less than 1 percent of the $184 billion in yearly total sales, it is a small piece of the pie, and is dominated by sites like Gap.com, LandsEnd.com and JCrew.com.</p>

        <p>DESIGNER fashion, unlike books or CD's, has not been an easy sell on the Web. For starters, there is the sizing and fit challenge -- how do you persuade consumers to buy high-end clothing without trying it on? There is the touch-and-feel problem -- how do you convey the look and texture of new fabrics and materials? Then there are limitations to graphic presentations, conflicts about distributing products and, beyond that, intangible issues like, how do you sell something as ephemeral as style?</p>
        <p>The surprising news is that online apparel sales are increasing, particularly among consumers in their mid-20's to mid-40's. The NPD Group, a market research company in Port Washington, N.Y., reports that Internet apparel sales for 1999 reached $1.1 billion and are expected to double this year. But, at just less than 1 percent of the $184 billion in yearly total sales, it is a small piece of the pie, and is dominated by sites like Gap.com, LandsEnd.com and JCrew.com.</p>
        <p>Of course, buying khakis online is one thing; buying a couture ensemble is quite another.</p>
        <p>While designer apparel can be purchased on upscale department store and luxury sites, designers themselves have been reluctant to dive into the waters of e-commerce. In 1998, Helmut Lang was the first designer to introduce his fall collection on the Internet, and many designers have used their sites to promote their clothing and products. But only a handful are selling anything directly.</p>
        <p>That is why the fashion community was abuzz in February when the Internet-shy Ralph Lauren signed a multimillion-dollar deal with NBC and ValueVision (which operates the Home Shopping Network) to form a new company, RL Media, which will develop Polo.com, a lifestyle Web site that will sell a range of the designer's products -- clothing and household accouterments --  later this year.</p>
        <p>''The deal is unique because it is a joint venture between three different companies,'' said Ken Cassar, a senior retail analyst for Jupiter Communications, an Internet research company in New York. ''NBC ponied up advertising time, Ralph Lauren ponied up his brand name and ValueVision ponied up $50 million in actual cash. The deal offers Ralph Lauren the potential of going a little bit more mass market.''</p>
        <p>On a smaller scale, Nicole Miller is one of the few designers who has achieved some success selling direct. Her site, at www. nicolemiller.com, offers accessories, some evening wear and bridesmaids' dresses, but no clothing from Ms. Miller's collection yet.</p>
        <p>''I don't think e-commerce has been all that great in the clothing area, so we'll be adding things slowly,'' Ms. Miller said. ''As far as my collection, that's going to be harder to sell online because in fashion, you're dealing with new fabrics every year. And people want to know what the fabrics feel like.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Miller is right to be cautious, analysts say. The recent demise of the luxury clothing site Boo.com, sponsored by, among others, Bernard Arnault, the Benetton family, J. P. Morgan &amp; Company and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, shows the unpredictability of selling high-end apparel on the Web.</p>
        <p>When image is everything, the Web poses special risks. Graphic limitations of the Web can make it hard for designers to get across the high-gloss image that is vital to preserving ''their brand equity,'' explained Evie Black Dykema, an analyst with Forrester Research, a research firm in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
        <p>For high-end designers, profits and image are intertwined. ''Selling style is different from selling CD's or books,'' Ms. Dykema said. ''Sales are not the first focus necessarily. Gucci, for instance, will spend $5 million on a campaign that may generate $50,000 in sales because the campaign's aura extends beyond the sales of clothing. Image is absolutely key, and going online may hurt that image. So designers may have a very long-term perspective in that sense and aren't as opportunistic perhaps.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Miller is not the only one who is taking it slowly. This month, Mr. Lang's site, www.helmutlang.com, will begin selling his new fragrance but no clothing or accessories. Dolce &amp; Gabbana's site, www.dolcegabbana.it, which has been up since March, is purely informational. ''There are no plans to sell apparel in the immediate future directly on our site,'' Stefano Gabbana said.</p>
        <p>Vera Wang's new site, www.verawang .com, will at first feature her bridal collection, store locations and text to promote her first book, ''Vera Wang Weddings,'' which will be published in 2001.</p>
        <p>''We have a five-year plan, and selling is a longer-term goal,'' said Chet Hazzard, the president and chief operating officer of Vera Wang. ''We want to provide high-quality applications like video, audio, interactive chats with Vera, articles and fashion shows. Vera is very interested in this. She knows this is the future. We want to make sure we do it right.''</p>
        <p>MOST designers realize that high fashion's prices have limited mass-market appeal. ''We really don't believe a bride is going to buy a bridal dress on the Internet,'' Mr. Hazzard said. ''It's a very expensive purchase -- it's not something you buy from a picture.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''There are some luxury sites that tell you they sell $7,000 earrings. I'd like to know how many. I'm not saying they didn't get one customer to buy them, but Vera and I look at things in a very practical way. Would Vera buy a $7,000 pair of earrings on the Internet? No.''</p>
        <p>But designers are coming to the belief that they can use the Web to sell more everyday products. ''We're looking at bridesmaids' apparel, bridal accessories, a gift registry, jewelry, stationery, fragrance, body, bath and home,'' Mr. Hazzard said. Mr. Gabbana also said that accessories might make more sense for online sales.</p>
        <p>Some fashion insiders may be in a wait-and-see mode about what other major brands are doing. ''In the world of fashion and high-end retail, there is a significant lemming effect,'' said Mr. Cassar, the analyst. ''When both Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger are selling directly on the Web, everyone else will have no choice but to follow suit.''</p>
        <p>Even if a designer decides not to sell online, having a strong Web presence is good. ''It's been a great advertising vehicle for us -- we get about 10,000 catalog requests a week,'' Ms. Miller said.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, she said, ''I believe people like the retail shopping experience.''</p>
        <p>Many agree. ''The brick-and-mortar department and retail stores will continue to be the primary outlet for purchases of luxury products,'' Mr. Cassar said. But the Web can attract high-fashion customers to retail stores. ''As designers build informational-communication sites, they will initiate a dialogue with the consumer, and they will then pass the consumer along to the department store or to their own retail stores for the transaction.''</p>
        <p>But ultimately,'' Mr. Cassar added, ''designer fashion is show business, something that plays better in the physical world.''</p>
        <p>Sales to Sample</p>
        <p>FOR years, sample sales -- where upscale designers sell sample outfits of their collections at greatly reduced prices -- were a closely guarded secret of hard-core fashionistas. Now online shopaholics can take advantage of this insider information. Two sites, Styleshop.com and Inshop.com, offer up-to-the-minute scoops about deals.</p>
        <p>Styleshop.com covers 700 cities in the United States. It also offers My Style, a free service in which you register what designers and stores you like and receive an e-mail message when there is a coming sample sale or department store sale of your designated favorites.</p>
        <p>Styleshop.com also has an e-commerce site, StyleShopDirect, which sells apparel from designers like Cynthia Rowley, Todd Oldham and Vivienne Tam.</p>
        <p>Inshop.com covers 52 cities in the United States as well as London. ''Imagine a version of the Zagat guide, but for local shopping,'' says Veronique Bardach, the chief executive of Inshop.com. The site also offers free e-mail alerts, and a Gotta Get It Guide, which offers information on the season's trendiest items in various cities.</p>
