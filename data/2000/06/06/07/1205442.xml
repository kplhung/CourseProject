        <p>With women making up 40 to 45 percent of overall business-travel market, the hotel industry is paying increasing attention to women, looking more closely at such things as responsive service and more pleasant, home-like rooms; marketing program developed by Wyndham Hotels and Resorts to increase its share of female business travel market discussed (Business Travel column) (M)</p>

        <p>A STAND-UP comedian -- Rita Rudner, I think it was -- once described the basic difference between men and women in their attitudes toward shelter. ''Men,'' she said, ''are essentially bears with furniture.'' She didn't need to add that women exhibit more exacting standards.</p>
        <p>Now that women make up 40 to 45 percent of the overall business-travel market (compared with about 1 percent in 1970), this anthropological fact of life is being reflected in two ways in the hotel industry. One, there's a rapidly growing awareness that if you want to market to the female business traveler, you've got to listen to her clear demands for things like more responsive service and more pleasant, home-like rooms. And two, you'd better be aware that women, far more then men, network with one another and are far more likely to compare notes on their business travel experiences, both while on the road and back at the office.</p>

        <p>A STAND-UP comedian -- Rita Rudner, I think it was -- once described the basic difference between men and women in their attitudes toward shelter. ''Men,'' she said, ''are essentially bears with furniture.'' She didn't need to add that women exhibit more exacting standards.</p>
        <p>Now that women make up 40 to 45 percent of the overall business-travel market (compared with about 1 percent in 1970), this anthropological fact of life is being reflected in two ways in the hotel industry. One, there's a rapidly growing awareness that if you want to market to the female business traveler, you've got to listen to her clear demands for things like more responsive service and more pleasant, home-like rooms. And two, you'd better be aware that women, far more then men, network with one another and are far more likely to compare notes on their business travel experiences, both while on the road and back at the office.</p>
        <p>''With women and hotels, it's not just a straight transaction -- you know, 'Give me a room with a door and a light and a shower.' '' said Cary Jehl Broussard, the vice president of Women on Their Way, a marketing program by Wyndham Hotels and Resorts to increase its share of the female business travel market at its more than 300 hotels in 38 states, Canada, the Caribbean and Europe.</p>
        <p>This is not to suggest that men can't tell a grand hotel from a flophouse. It's just that women tend to ''pay attention to the details'' when staying in a hotel and manage to make their preferences known in ways that can make the owners pay attention, Ms. Broussard said.</p>
        <p>''I think that men, in the past at least, sometimes felt that nothing was really going to change in hotels,'' she said. ''It was like, 'Hey, I don't want to have a high expectation level of what my room is going to look like. I'm happy, I'm satisfied; there's the E.S.P.N., there's the bed. Maybe I'll have some potato skins and a beer.' ''</p>
        <p>She continued: ''Basically, that's what women's choices were, too, until more and more women started traveling on business and talking to one another and realizing that they could be heard. They could get salads on the menu. They could walk into a room that looks more like their bedroom at home.''</p>
        <p>Like some other hotel companies, Wyndham specifically designs rooms and hotel services with the female business traveler in mind. Trying to establish more firmly its brand as a leader in the market, Wyndham also sponsors a commercial Web page and a forum for women who travel on business. It's www.womenbusinesstravelers.com, and on Friday, the company will use it to post the full text of a comprehensive survey on the women's business-travel market that was conducted by the New York University Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Travel Administration. Though it was commissioned by Wyndham, the survey is an objective, noncommercial look at the overall business-travel market for women. Here, chosen arbitrarily from the report, are a few of the findings:</p>
        <p>The typical female business traveler is married, childless and over age 40. She is likely to be the secondary wage earner. But when you look at more frequent business travelers, who typically include higher-paid managers, the male-female discrepancies tend to fade. Among women who make more than 11 business trips a year, more than half are primary wage earners. Also, while traveling on business, women are more likely than men to tack on a vacation day.</p>
        <p>Women are far less likely than men to describe business travel as frustrating. They value late check-out in a hotel far more than men. Women believe that hotel desk clerks (and flight attendants) treat men better. On the other hand, men believe that bellhops and room service attendants give better service to women.</p>
        <p>Women place a greater value on quality room service -- but not, as is commonly supposed in the industry, because they're more worried about personal safety in venturing out to eat alone in a restaurant in a strange location. On a list of reasons women in the survey gave for ordering room service meals, ''indulgence'' ranked No. 1. ''Not wanting to eat alone in restaurants'' was dead last. ''Safety'' was next to last.</p>
        <p>Women aren't telling hotels they want more 20-story waterfalls in lobbies. Most of the things women talk about wanting on the road don't require huge capital expenditures, Ms. Broussard said. ''Just doing a little bit goes a long way,'' she added. ''You don't have to spend a lot of money to make the experience more pleasant for women. And men, once they experience the changes you've made, then they start to notice.''</p>
        <p>At the airport, here's a good reason not to know Jack. The following incident occurred Monday at Oakland International Airport near Detroit, according to The Associated Press. A passenger on a corporate jet taxiing for takeoff called to a colleague on board, ''Hi, Jack!'' The greeting was transmitted over an open cockpit microphone to the tower, which decided there was a hijacking afoot and called the Oakland County Sheriff's Department, which sent in its SWAT unit. The plane was ordered back to the terminal until the authorities determined that all was well. The police said the incident proved the system works.</p>
