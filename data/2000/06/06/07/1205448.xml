        <p>President Alberto K. Fujimori is promising new efforts to strengthen democratic safeguards in reaction to a flurry of international criticism over his re-election in a vote that was widely viewed as flawed.</p>
        <p>In interviews and speeches, Mr. Fujimori has pledged to reduce the size and powers of his intelligence service. The agency was widely said to be leading a smear and intimidation campaign against Mr. Fujimori's opponents before the presidential election on April 9 and the runoff on May 28.</p>
        <p>He has also pledged to overhaul the judicial system, giving special attention to resuscitating the inactive Constitutional Tribunal, which is roughly equivalent to the United States Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The tribunal has been dormant since Congress fired three of its seven members in 1997, after they had opposed Mr. Fujimori's interpretation of the Constitution. He concluded that the document allowed him to run for a third five-year term despite a constitutional limit of two terms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori has gone so far as to characterize Peru's system as ''an imperfect democracy.'' In a televised speech, he promised to ''correct errors with the proposition of fortifying democratic institutions.''</p>
        <p>Alejandro Toledo, the opposition candidate who dropped out of the race days before the runoff, has expressed nothing but disdain for Mr. Fujimori's sudden moderate tone. Instead, Mr. Toledo is promising to lead a march of four million protesters next month, with the aims of blocking Mr. Fujimori's inauguration on July 28 and forcing new elections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toledo officially withdrew from the runoff, alleging that the election was tainted. According to the official count, Mr. Fujimori won 51 percent of the runoff vote. The rest of the ballots were cast for Mr. Toledo or were left blank or intentionally spoiled as a protest.</p>
        <p>In the last week, Mr. Toledo's efforts at organizing mass protests appeared to be flagging, with student marches not attracting more than a few hundred protesters. The stock market and currency have recovered, lending the appearance that the country is returning to normal after a tumultuous campaign and tainted vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori has extended his promises of liberalization as the Organization of American States voted this week to send a high-level mission to Peru in a few days to meet Mr. Fujimori and members of the opposition. The panel is to report back with recommendations on ensuring the independence of the judiciary and to expand press freedoms.</p>
        <p>The likelihood of strong O.A.S. action appears increasingly remote. But the Clinton administration says it will take independent action to protest elections that it says did not meet minimal international standards of fairness. The American Congress is quite likely to cut some of its $128 million in annual aid to Peru. Mr. Fujimori would like to limit the damage as much as possible.</p>
        <p>Critics of Mr. Fujimori say his liberal gestures are similar to those he made after he faced international condemnation for closing the Supreme Court and Congress and suspending the Constitution in 1992. Faced with sanctions, he promised to hold new Congressional elections.  But a few years later, critics note, Mr. Fujimori used legal maneuvers to silence critical television broadcasters and used his intelligence service to harass the opposition.</p>
