        <p>With the $20.3 billion acquisition of Bestfoods by Unilever and the likely sale of Nabisco Holdings, the number of links in the food chain is dwindling.</p>
        <p>More consolidation is expected, many food industry analysts said yesterday. But the number of potential buyers and attractive targets is shrinking.</p>
        <p>''The landscape of the packaged food industry is changing,'' said John M. McMillin, an analyst at Prudential Securities. ''The Unilever-Bestfoods deal is step No. 1. Nabisco will be step No. 2. But I wouldn't look for that many more after these two are done. And there are not going to be many more premium cash bids.''</p>
        <p>Investors seem to agree.</p>
        <p>Shares of Bestfoods surged $6.1875 yesterday, to $69.1875. And Nabisco Holdings rose by $2.375, to $49.875. But the rest of the food group was rather quiet.</p>
        <p>''Bestfoods is an anomaly as a target,'' said David C. Nelson, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''They are one of a very small group of food companies that have been delivering quality growth by volume, and they are the only U.S. food company with exposure in emerging markets. They have been the most attractive target in the industry for a very long time. Just because Unilever was attracted to Bestfoods doesn't mean someone else is going to be attracted to Campbell Soup, H. J. Heinz or Kellogg.''</p>
        <p>At more than 14 times earnings, Bestfoods is drawing a very full price from Unilever.</p>
        <p>Still, analysts say it provides something of a guide to just how high the bidding might go for Nabisco, which is not regarded as highly as Bestfoods.</p>
        <p>''If you take that multiple and blindly smack it on Nabisco, that gives you a minimum price tag of $56 a share, or about $15 billion,'' said Jaine I. Mehring, an industry analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>Though other large food companies, including Groupe Danone S.A., have expressed interest in Nabisco, it is widely assumed on Wall Street that Philip Morris will be the winning bidder.</p>
        <p>''It looks as though Philip Morris is in the driver's seat because it has deeper financial pockets and a bigger U.S. food business from which to integrate and achieve synergies than Danone does,'' said John M. O'Neil, an analyst at PaineWebber.</p>
        <p>But Mr. McMillin of Prudential said he did not expect the winning bidder for Nabisco to come close to matching the price Unilever agreed to pay for Bestfoods. ''Nabisco has a pretty vibrant, growing business, but it is not as global as Bestfoods,'' he said. ''I am not sure other food companies can command that sort of multiple.''</p>
        <p>With Bestfoods and Nabisco off the table, the universe of food companies that might be on the block shrinks considerably. In addition to Campbell Soup, Heinz and Kellogg, the remaining attractive names include General Mills, Quaker Oats and Ralston Purina.</p>
        <p>And if Philip Morris wins Nabisco, the number of potential acquirers also shrinks.</p>
        <p>If Unilever and Philip Morris are included, ''there are only six or seven potential buyers that can pony up'' the kind of money Unilever paid for Bestfoods, Mr. McMillin said. ''Danone could be one. Nestle, Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola are also on the list. But that's it.''</p>
        <p>Nestle, the world's biggest food company, is widely expected to make a bid for something. ''Nestle is the wild card in the industry,'' Mr. O'Neil of PaineWebber said.</p>
        <p>General Mills or Quaker Oats would be attractive additions to Nestle's current mix of products, Mr. O'Neil said.</p>
        <p>Nestle is already familiar with General Mills through its Cereal Partners Worldwide venture. And Quaker Oats' Gatorade business would be a ''wonderful complement'' to Nestle's global bottled beverage business, which includes Perrier, Nestea and Poland Spring.</p>
        <p>Although the names and the numbers involved are big, the Bestfoods and Nabisco deals will not pressure competitors to seek partners, Ms. Mehring said.</p>
        <p>Rather, these combinations ''make it more apparent in some cases that there is value to be created,'' she said. ''If you own food assets that you don't think are core to your business or you are not maximizing on your own, you might think about selling into this bubble.''</p>
