        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Chase Manhattan Bank's announced move from lower Manhattan to the New Jersey waterfront (news article, June 2) is another dismaying example of the Giuliani administration's failure to keep valuable corporate jobs in New York City.</p>
        <p>You accurately note that alternative, and less expensive, corporate space is still available in Brooklyn and the other boroughs, yet the mayor and his Economic Development Corporation have consistently failed to support and promote these alternatives.</p>

        <p>Chase Manhattan Bank's announced move from lower Manhattan to the New Jersey waterfront (news article, June 2) is another dismaying example of the Giuliani administration's failure to keep valuable corporate jobs in New York City.</p>
        <p>You accurately note that alternative, and less expensive, corporate space is still available in Brooklyn and the other boroughs, yet the mayor and his Economic Development Corporation have consistently failed to support and promote these alternatives.</p>
        <p>Instead, the administration has chosen to spend more than $150 million to construct minor league baseball stadiums that will generate a handful of low-wage, part-time jobs. Had the administration chosen to spend this money on targeted corporate retention efforts, Chase, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch might now be moving their high-wage jobs to a reinvigorated Brooklyn rather than across the river.</p>
