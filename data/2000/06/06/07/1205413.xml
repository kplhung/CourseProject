        <p>IT was a spring evening last March. I sat in a gravel courtyard outside the Cafe du Lezard in St. Remy-de-Provence, waiting for a table to clear. I ordered the house drink from a chalkboard, a rose peche: a glass of rose wine with a splash of peach liqueur.</p>
        <p>Above me, the azure sky deepened slowly like the sea. The almond trees in the village were flowering pink and white. The waitress set out local olives with my drink. I took a sip; it was like an interior sunset. Two ingredients. It couldn't have been simpler. But it had the big kaboom of science. The next thing I remember I was hungry. The first asparagus. Young lamb. Early strawberries.</p>

        <p>IT was a spring evening last March. I sat in a gravel courtyard outside the Cafe du Lezard in St. Remy-de-Provence, waiting for a table to clear. I ordered the house drink from a chalkboard, a rose peche: a glass of rose wine with a splash of peach liqueur.</p>
        <p>Above me, the azure sky deepened slowly like the sea. The almond trees in the village were flowering pink and white. The waitress set out local olives with my drink. I took a sip; it was like an interior sunset. Two ingredients. It couldn't have been simpler. But it had the big kaboom of science. The next thing I remember I was hungry. The first asparagus. Young lamb. Early strawberries.</p>
        <p>The idea of the rose peche came back with me to New York, like a Provencal glow. But it was harder to find the same understanding, or availability, of the house drink. Even with a wave of French bistros, the classic concept of a house drink is a rarity in this city. The beautiful math of the rose peche, elementary and elegant, is rarer still.</p>
        <p>Like the social brush of a kiss or a handshake, the house drink is part ritual, part greeting -- a gesture taken to encourage even a stranger to relax like a friend, by coming forward and showing a bit of yourself. ''It's nice to have some sort of signature welcome to offer people, unique to your restaurant,'' said Morgen Jacobson, the chef and owner of Quince on West 54th Street. His version, created by his sommelier, Robert Hillyer, is an aperitif of Champagne and quince eau de vie.</p>
        <p>Unlike a cocktail, which is spirits based, the house drink is typically made with wine, colored by an unusual flavor. Like aperitifs or vins maison, it has more style than substance. The kir is the best-known example: like the rose peche, it is a glass of wine sweetened subtly with a fruit liqueur, usually creme de cassis.</p>
        <p>A house cocktail you can get in New York. At the Brasserie in Midtown, the head bartender, Tim Hulbert, makes a Marie Antoinette: Cognac, Pineau de Charentes, Champagne and peach puree. It's a cake-eater's kind of aperitif. Sophisticated, but it didn't have the smile of the rose peche's switched-at-birth secret: the prince living happily as the pauper.</p>
        <p>At Casimir in the East Village, the house cocktails include the Wounded Elephant: a vodka martini with cassis and litchis. ''The vodka is the elephant, the cassis is the blood and the litchis are the bullets,'' said Eric Lagrange, Casimir's chef and a part owner. ''We call them cocktails but they're aperitifs. If you call them aperitifs, people look at you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lagrange had had the rose peche at Cafe du Lezard and said it was a traditional French invention. ''What I like about this type of aperitif is that it's based on produce from the terroir: rose wine and peaches. Unfortunately, we don't have that much in New York. We have martinis.''</p>
        <p>But the idea of the house drink seemed too good to be untrue in New York. And I discovered that there are those who are trying.</p>
        <p>Tocqueville on East 15th Street offers a glass of Champagne partied up with a short shot of passion fruit juice. The crab-roe color was superb, like a shade of Martha Stewart house paint, but the drink never rose above the two ingredients lifting it into the air. An acrophobic acrobat.</p>
        <p>At Quince, the house aperitif, served in a flute, had the effervescence, blossom and urbane invitation to eat that Mr. Jacobson hoped for. But the rose peche's outdoors sense of the good life, like freckles that the sun brings out, or the salt dust that dries on your skin when you've been swimming in the ocean, eluded it.</p>
        <p>In their simplicity, house drinks are perfect summer drinks. Recently at Rustic, a restaurant on Court Street in Brooklyn, the French-door-style facade was thrown open to the sidewalk, and though it wasn't the palms of St. Remy, I sat at the bar watching strollers in short sleeves enjoy the evening like beachcombers. I ordered a blood-orange rosemary kir, the house drink, with skepticism. It sounded fancy. It looked muddy, like unfiltered apple juice. It smelled like rosemary; I expected it to taste like focaccia.</p>
        <p>But it had a lighter, bright idea of its own. The blood-orange juice made it more tart than sweet. An albarino ripened it with fruit. The rosemary added a savory edge that engaged the appetite. It seemed in good-natured agreement with the grilled calamari and merguez, roasted tomatoes and artichokes on the menu.</p>
        <p>The drink is not as straightforward as the rose peche. Ken Johnson, Rustic's executive chef, steeps fresh rosemary in boiling blood-orange juice, sugar and water, then strains and cools it for his kir. But it had the same born skill that made the Cafe du Lezard drink so satisfying.</p>
        <p>At Pastis in the meatpacking district, you get pastis: the antiqued mirror by the bar lists six specialties. The pastis l'amande, with almond syrup and soda water, has the right attitude. The sweet cream of the almond syrup negotiated the acerbic anise of the pastis smoothly, with a diplomacy that the management might be asked to study.</p>
        <p>The house drink at Panache, on Sixth Avenue at 12th Street, is the panache: a French standard of two-thirds beer to one-third lemonade. It is as easy as the days are now long, built for brutal heat, and I intend to drink many before August is over. The panache is as companionable as it is excellent cold.</p>
        <p>But at home, my house drink is the rose peche. I have it as I cook, after a day's work, listening to the neighborhood through my open windows and waiting for my table.</p>
        <p>I mix its amber pink, then share its lovely custom.</p>
