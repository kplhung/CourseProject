        <p>The 3Com Corporation intends to announce today that it has formed a new company to take over its analog modem business, according to a person close to the company. The new company, which 3Com is forming in partnership with the Accton Technology Corporation of Taiwan and NatSteel Electronics Ltd. of Singapore, is to be called U.S. Robotics. In 1997, 3Com acquired the U.S. Robotics Corporation, which included the group that eventually produced the popular Palm Pilot computer but which was best known for making high-performance computer modems. In recent years, however, 3Com has struggled to manage its disparate product lines, so it spun off Palm and said in March that it would spin off its modem business.</p>
