        <p>Construction of a new entrance for the historic subway station at Broadway and 72nd Street in Manhattan will start next week, but some riders say transit officials have missed a chance to ease the crowded conditions below ground.</p>
        <p>No one is complaining about much of the work that will be done in the $53 million project, which includes adding elevators, four stairways and an entrance building next to Verdi Park. But some critics are concerned that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has no plans to widen the unusually narrow platform as part of the three-year project.</p>
        <p>Although plans call for lengthening the platform by about 50 feet, some riders say much of the congestion is caused by the platform's 10-foot width. Riders fear they could be elbowed onto the tracks, especially during rush hour. About 31,000 people enter the station every day, according to the M.T.A.</p>
        <p>''This is where the danger comes in,'' said Madeleine Polayes, president of the Coalition for a Livable West Side. ''People in the morning are squashed on that platform, and there really is very little room to maneuver. We've been lucky that we haven't had a serious accident.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon, dozens of riders who had just gotten off an uptown train stood in line to scurry  up a wet staircase. The stairs are so narrow that only two people can squeeze their way up side by side.</p>
        <p>On the platform, a woman in a green raincoat stood munching a cookie and watching her 5-year-old daughter. ''I think it's very dangerous, especially for children,'' said the mother, Valerie Watnick. ''I've been here with several kids at a time, sometimes three of them, and it's a big concern.''</p>
        <p>Years ago, transit officials said they would consider widening the platform at a cost of $40 million if it proved necessary. Since then, they have backed down from that plan, saying the cost would be too high. Despite protests from the community, they are standing by that decision.</p>
        <p>''That was just not feasible,'' said Deirdre Parker, an M.T.A. spokeswoman. ''It would have been prohibitive.''</p>
        <p>For more than 20 years, plans to renovate the brown-brick station, a city landmark built in 1904, have been motivated by an expected surge in riders from proposed large-scale developments. Most of those buildings were planned for the old rail yards along the Hudson River, from 59th to 72nd Streets. That is where Donald J. Trump recently began building Trump Place, a series of apartment towers.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mysore Nagaraja, the vice president for capital improvements at New York City Transit -- the unit of the M.T.A. that operates subways and buses -- acknowledged that a surge of commuters from Mr. Trump's buildings and other nearby developments would require a widening of the subway platform within the next decade. But because the city had more pressing projects, the expansion would have to wait, he said.</p>
        <p>Such reasoning has drawn its share of criticism.</p>
        <p>''The M.T.A. has made a bad strategic decision by thinking that by doing only this much in their construction, they will stop congestion,'' said Assemblyman Scott M. Stringer, a Democrat who represents the 67th District. ''Because of the development pressure, because of the population explosion on the Upper West Side, we will need to expand the platform.''</p>
