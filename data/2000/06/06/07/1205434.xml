        <p>Here in eastern Turkey, which has been racked by war and terror for years, a hotel manager named Mehmet Kaya is seeing something quite unexpected: tourists.</p>
        <p>''Last May we had some reservations, but most of them were canceled and only two small groups showed up,'' Mr. Kaya said as a Belgian couple walked into his lobby bar.

        <p>Here in eastern Turkey, which has been racked by war and terror for years, a hotel manager named Mehmet Kaya is seeing something quite unexpected: tourists.</p>
        <p>''Last May we had some reservations, but most of them were canceled and only two small groups showed up,'' Mr. Kaya said as a Belgian couple walked into his lobby bar. In May, he said, nine groups booked and there were no cancellations. ''We're even getting people walking in off the street without reservations. I can't remember the last time that happened.''</p>
        <p>Less than a year after peace began settling over the mostly Kurdish east, tourists are starting to return. Their arrival suggests that the tourism industry could become a source of income and stability in a region where unemployment is higher than anywhere else in the country.</p>
        <p>Kars is the nearest town to the spectacular ruined city of Ani, which was a thriving Armenian capital 10 centuries ago. In the 1980's Ani attracted about 35,000 visitors each year. But during the 1990's, when much of the region was under a form of military rule, it lay all but deserted. This spring, tourists have suddenly begun appearing again. Fifteen thousand are expected by the end of the summer.</p>
        <p>Until last year military permits were necessary to visit Ani, and often they were denied. Now a tourism office in Kars issues permits routinely.</p>
        <p>During the 1990's, as Turkish troops battled Kurdish rebels in this region, soldiers were everywhere, and they often treated strangers as likely spies. Violence was common and tourism all but unthinkable.</p>
        <p>Today the Kurdish rebel leader is in jail. His guerrillas have stopped fighting and his Kurdistan Workers Party has stopped calling for a tourist boycott of Turkey. Only a portion of the region remains under emergency rule, and local politicians are urging that it be lifted entirely.</p>
        <p>Conditions in most eastern provinces are more relaxed than they have been in years. The army still maintains some highway checkpoints, but foreigners are generally waved through. At some checkpoints, signs have been erected that say: ''Good-bye, Have a Nice Trip.''</p>
        <p>''The security situation has improved so radically that people are actually talking about tourism, which even a year ago was almost unimaginable,'' said Stuart Jones, the American consul in Adana, which is on the edge of the former war zone. ''I'm not sure we're at the point where people can feel comfortable driving wherever they want, but a lot is possible now that hasn't been possible for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Signs of this awakening are palpable throughout the region. On an afternoon in May, a tour bus disgorged three dozen Israelis in front of an imposing tenth-century Georgian church near the town of Yusufeli. And at the Ishak Pasha castle, a spectacular monument in an area where gunfire used to echo every night, several hundred visitors turned up on a spring weekend.</p>
        <p>''This is the first time I've seen anything like this,'' said Ahmet Calayer, a local resident who guides tourists around the castle. ''We're getting more people in a week than we used to get in two or three months.''</p>
        <p>The region that is now eastern Turkey has been a crossroads of civilization for almost as long as there have been human beings. It is astonishingly rich in monuments and ancient sites, many of which have barely even been discovered. Before war spread through the region in the early 1990's, it seemed on its way to becoming an important tourist destination.</p>
        <p>Although tourists have begun returning here more quickly than anyone had imagined, some places are still not quite ready for them. In cities and towns that have been hotbeds of Kurdish nationalism, police control is still too tight for comfort. Some towns are still off limits to all outsiders.</p>
        <p>''I brought some foreign journalists here, and every time we went in or out of town the police stopped us and checked everyone's papers,'' said Talip Bilen, who owns a hotel in the historic town of Mardin. ''Naturally their impression was negative.  An effort to help our area was turned almost upside-down.''</p>
        <p>In Van, which lies on the shore of Turkey's largest lake and might benefit from a tourist boom more than any other town in the region, people are hoping for a steady easing of controls.</p>
        <p>One of the few construction projects in Van in recent months has been a renovation and expansion of the town's main hotel.</p>
        <p>''Right now we're 75 percent booked, and we expect this to continue all season,'' said Murat Turkoglu, the hotel owner. ''If this mood continues for another few years, our region will be visited again just like any other beautiful part of the world.''</p>
