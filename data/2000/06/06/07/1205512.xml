        <p>With his floppy hat and sunglasses, Reggie Miller looked like a beach bum rather than the National Basketball Association's most feared assassin. Yet even back on his home turf, he couldn't hide from his villainous image.</p>
        <p>Miller was born in nearby Riverside, became a local legend at Riverside Polytechnic High and blossomed into an all-American at U.C.L.A. Now, he returns here for the N.B.A. finals as the bad guy at his own homecoming, the Indiana Pacer most capable of spiking the punch at this Lakers lovefest.</p>
        <p>Just as he did against the Knicks in the Eastern Conference finals, Miller again rejoiced in being the antagonist. ''We hope they overlook us,'' he said. ''We're not coming in here to lay down. We're coming in here to shock the world.''</p>
        <p>Still, Miller's penchant for trash talk was replaced somewhat by reverence for his first trip to the N.B.A. finals. He sounded almost polite in his overall assessment of the four-of-seven-game series against the Lakers that begins Wednesday night at the Staples Center. After spending 12 years trying to reach the finals, Miller also was mindful that this might be his first and last chance to win a championship. ''Let's face it, they deserve to be here and have the home-court advantage,'' he said of the Lakers. ''It took a whole season to find any chinks in their armor.''</p>
        <p>''We thought we had some pretty tough series out East. But they had the best records in the league,'' Miller said, referring to Los Angeles and Portland. ''Rightfully so, they should get most of the publicity. But you can't take anything away from our series with Milwaukee, Philadelphia, even New York.''</p>
        <p>The Lakers spoke today mostly of stopping Miller, a task they see as crucial as the Pacers' challenge of guarding Shaquille O'Neal. Miller has averaged almost 6 points a game more in the playoffs than in the regular season (23.8 to 18.1). He is also coming off one of his greatest postseason performances, a 34-point effort that included five 3-point baskets in a six-minute span during the Pacers' 93-80 victory over the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''Reggie loves the contact, drawing fouls and getting to the free- throw line,'' Lakers guard Kobe Bryant said. ''He's excellent at coming off screens, feeling where your body is at, and bumping into it.''</p>
        <p>In perhaps the biggest compliment, O'Neal added, ''Reggie's not really the type of guy you can stop.''</p>
        <p>The Lakers plan to start with the veteran Ron Harper guarding Miller, hoping to draw on his vast experience from the Chicago Bulls. Bryant and the reserve guard Brian Shaw will also give chase.</p>
        <p>''Both are great defenders; they both present different challenges,'' Miller said of Harper and Bryant. ''Both are quick and both play good position defense. Kobe gambles a little more, and Ron plays it safe.'' The 21-year-old Bryant presents a curious matchup for the 34-year-old Miller. The guards spent time working out together in Southern California last summer and traded insights into each other's games. Miller wanted to know more about Bryant's arsenal of one-on-one moves; Bryant asked for tips on Miller's specialty of running and shooting off screens.</p>
        <p>''I really don't know that much about his game,'' Bryant said. ''All I really know is about how good he is coming off screens.''</p>
        <p>Rick Carlisle, Indiana's assistant coach, said Miller raised his game last summer in response to another playoff loss to the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''Last year, we were beaten in the New York series because Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell could create their shots literally at will,'' Carlisle said. ''Reggie studied his game, studied the game of those two guys, and got on a program where he was going to create that dimension to his game. He's worked very hard.''</p>
        <p>''This year, he didn't beat them coming off screens. He beat them facing up, and putting our team on his back.'' Like Miller, the Pacers are thirtysomething veterans who view these finals as their best and last chance at a title.</p>
        <p>Pacers Coach Larry Bird added: ''It's playoff time. Reggie's the man, and knows he's the man.''</p>
