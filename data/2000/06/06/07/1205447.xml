        <p>By midnight on D-Day, June 6, 1944, Allied forces held a truly marginal amount of terrain on the European landmass -- a few Normandy beaches and headlands, some isolated pockets of French soil further inland, all of it scattered over a disjointed front some 55 miles long. But that was enough. What followed in the next few days and weeks was an industrial infusion of sorts, the landing of men and machines at a rate that had never been imagined before.</p>
        <p>World War II was a theater of invention as well as a theater of destruction, and the National D-Day Museum, which opened yesterday in New Orleans, is a reminder of that fact. One of the things the National D-Day Museum commemorates is the fact that most of the American soldiers who landed in Normandy on D-Day did so in vehicles called LCVP's -- short for landing craft, vehicle, personnel -- which were invented by Andrew Jackson Higgins and manufactured in New Orleans. Before being deployed in the English Channel on D-Day and loaded with soldiers, each vessel had been tested, months earlier, in Lake Pontchartrain.</p>

        <p>By midnight on D-Day, June 6, 1944, Allied forces held a truly marginal amount of terrain on the European landmass -- a few Normandy beaches and headlands, some isolated pockets of French soil further inland, all of it scattered over a disjointed front some 55 miles long.

        <p>World War II was a theater of invention as well as a theater of destruction, and the National D-Day Museum, which opened yesterday in New Orleans, is a reminder of that fact. One of the things the National D-Day Museum commemorates is the fact that most of the American soldiers who landed in Normandy on D-Day did so in vehicles called LCVP's -- short for landing craft, vehicle, personnel -- which were invented by Andrew Jackson Higgins and manufactured in New Orleans. Before being deployed in the English Channel on D-Day and loaded with soldiers, each vessel had been tested, months earlier, in Lake Pontchartrain.</p>
        <p>Dwight D. Eisenhower attributed Allied victory to the Higgins boat, as it was called. For the men who rode in them, there was no use pretending the Channel was Pontchartrain. The diesels churned shoreward in earnest, the sea rose and fell, and then the forward ramps of the LCVP's dropped open, framing a view of France that has come to define the turning point of that distant war. It is a story that never grows old.</p>
