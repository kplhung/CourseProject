        <p>Britain's royal family has fallen to feuding over a subject on which one would expect them to be solidly united: genetics.</p>
        <p>Prince Charles, the country's most famous organic farmer, has found his passionately stated views against growing genetically modified crops suddenly under assault from his sister, Princess Anne, and his father, Prince Philip.</p>
        <p>''It is a huge oversimplification to say all farming ought to be organic'' or there should be no genetically modified foods, Princess Anne said in an interview published on Monday in a magazine called The Grocer.</p>
        <p>''Man has been tinkering with food production and plant development for such a long time,'' she said, ''that it's a bit cheeky to suddenly get nervous about it when, fundamentally, you are doing much the same thing.''</p>
        <p>Prince Philip told an audience at Windsor Castle on Monday night, ''People are worried about genetically modified organisms getting into the environment, but what people forget is that the introduction of exotic species -- like, for instance, the introduction of the gray squirrel into this country -- is going to do or has done far more damage than a genetically modified piece of potato.''</p>
        <p>Prince Philip did not choose his vegetable lightly.</p>
        <p>It was a study conducted on genetically altered potatoes by a scientist in Scotland in August 1998 that set off what has by now become a voluble and forceful movement by protesters against planting what they call ''Frankenstein food'' in Britain. When the work of the scientist, Dr. Arpad Pusztai, was dismissed as ''garbage'' by the government's chief scientist, Sir Robert May, Prince Charles rushed to his defense.</p>
        <p>The heir to the throne permits only organic farming on his Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire, and he regularly speaks out on the perils of genetic engineering.</p>
        <p>He used a nationally broadcast BBC lecture last month to raise the moral stakes in the debate, casting the argument as one of science acting in opposition to religion and saying that experimentation was taking man into realms that belong to ''God and God alone.''</p>
        <p>''We need to rediscover a reverence for the natural world, irrespective of its usefulness to ourselves,'' he said. ''If literally nothing is held sacred anymore, what is there to prevent us treating our entire world as some 'great laboratory of life' with potentially disastrous long-term consequences.''</p>
        <p>Playing on a cultural distrust of science and on fears lingering from the epidemic of mad cow disease in British herds in the mid-1990's, the opposition to genetically modified food has had a big impact in Britain.</p>
        <p>Major food manufacturers, supermarkets, restaurants and fast food chains have had to assure consumers that they have stopped stocking foods with any genetically modified ingredients, and environmental groups have destroyed whole fields of experimental crops being tested under government directives.</p>
        <p>Opinion polls indicate that more than three-quarters of the British public condemns the testing, which is supported by the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair. Mr. Blair is eager to proceed with the trials, arguing that otherwise British science and British business will be shut out of future agricultural development.</p>
        <p>Prince Charles said he thought that was nonsense, but his sister wasn't impressed.</p>
