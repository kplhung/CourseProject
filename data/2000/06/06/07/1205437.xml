        <p>Before meeting with business leaders in Milan, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia worked on some unfinished business concerning Rome today, explaining to Italians why he had not explicitly invited Pope John Paul II to Russia.</p>
        <p>''We do not want in any way to harm the discussion in progress between the Orthodox Church and the Catholic one,'' Mr. Putin said in Milan. In Rome earlier, he said, on the same subject, ''We must proceed with caution and not do harm in attempting to do good.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's remarks were welcomed at the Vatican, where the pope has never hidden his hunger to visit Russia and to mend the 1,000-year rift between Rome and the Eastern Orthodox Church. There is little optimism in the Vatican that the pope can soon overturn Patriarch Aleksy II's longstanding refusal to invite John Paul II to Moscow.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Putin's visit brought cautious optimism that this Russian president, unlike his predecessors, might privately persuade the Russian Orthodox Church to change its position. Both Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin publicly invited the pope to Moscow, but failed to persuade the patriarch to accept such a visit.</p>
        <p>''A papal trip to Moscow was never on the agenda for the visit,'' the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said today. ''When the Holy Father decides to make this trip and when the Orthodox patriarch decides to make the trip, it will be made. Once the door is opened it remains open until it is closed.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Navarro-Valls noted that the pope was ''very pleased'' with his meeting with Mr. Putin on Monday, both because the Russian president chose to visit the Vatican so early in his tenure and because the pope was ''very interested in the serious program Mr. Putin spoke about.'' Mr. Putin mainly talked to the pope about his vision of a Russia better integrated with the West, as well as security concerns common to Europe and Russia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin unveiled a gift from Moscow to Rome during his visit -- a statue of Pushkin in Villa Borghese. He also had to deal with more contemporary aspects of Russia culture. Asked by Italian newspaper editors about organized crime and corruption in Russia, Mr. Putin rather tartly told his Italian audience that, ''Mafia is not a Russian word.''</p>
        <p>He quickly assured his audience that he was pressing legislation to reduce crime and corruption and cut tax rates. But Mr. Putin, who has sought to make Russian nationalist pride a hallmark of his administration, apparently did not wish to appear overtly pro-Western. ''I can assure you that the success of these reforms is not just in the interest of the United States, Europe or Italy,'' he said, ''but to Russia above all.''</p>
        <p>In Milan, he met with directors of Fiat, the Italian car company, including the honorary chairman, Gianni Agnelli. He also met with representatives of Eni, the Italian energy company in a partnership with Gazprom, the Russian energy company.  Among other projects, they have a deal for a natural gas pipeline from southern Russia to Turkey.</p>
        <p>Security was tight throughout Mr. Putin's two-day visit, but Italian Communists and Greens held a small demonstration outside Milan's city hall, across from La Scala opera house. One woman, brandishing a sign that said ''Chechen blood,'' hurled a bottle of red-dyed water that landed next to Mr. Putin's Mercedes-Benz, spraying a few drops on it. It was one of the few public reminders during Mr. Putin's visit of  Russia's war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.</p>
