        <p>For Paul L. Howard Jr., anything that could go wrong has gone wrong during the last three weeks.</p>
        <p>Until Monday, Mr. Howard, the Fulton County district attorney, was spearheading the murder prosecution of the Baltimore Ravens star Ray Lewis and two other men for two stabbing deaths in a street brawl on Super Bowl night here. It was to be the biggest case of Mr. Howard's career and one of the most closely watched in Atlanta in years.</p>
        <p>The case held national interest because of Mr. Lewis's fame as an all-pro linebacker and local interest because the killings had taken place in Buckhead, a glitzy night life district where violent crime has generated citywide concern. Though it had been four years since he had prosecuted a case, Mr. Howard decided to try this one himself. It would put him on national television in the midst of his first re-election campaign.</p>
        <p>But today, Mr. Lewis took the stand in Superior Court, not as a defendant, but as a witness who had pleaded guilty to a mere misdemeanor and been sentenced to one year's probation. Over the weekend, after watching his case against Mr. Lewis crumble in the hands of unreliable witnesses, Mr. Howard offered his celebrity defendant a deal: the reduced misdemeanor charge in exchange for Mr. Lewis's testimony against two co-defendants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis, 25, who has a four-year, $26 million contract with the Ravens, pleaded guilty to a charge of obstruction of justice stemming from the ''incomplete statement'' he made to the police, his lawyer said.</p>
        <p>The disintegration of the prosecution's case has become a public embarrassment for the 48-year-old Mr. Howard, with every misstep magnified by intense media coverage. Even those lawyers who say they like him acknowledge that Mr. Howard has had a rough couple of weeks.</p>
        <p>''You usually encounter some problems in a prosecution; he just encountered every one of them,'' said Jack Martin, a criminal defense lawyer here. ''What was shocking about this case in my mind was that it wasn't just one witness that fell apart, but all of the witnesses that fell apart.''</p>
        <p>While he faces no primary opposition, Mr. Howard, a Democrat, can expect to be reminded of the Lewis trial in the fall. Some here believe his political fate may depend on whether he wins convictions against the two remaining defendants, Joseph Sweeting of Miami and Reginald Oakley of Baltimore.</p>
        <p>''There's been some bungling,'' said John M. Turner Jr., one of two lawyers running for the Republican nomination. ''You better believe that will be an issue in my campaign.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Howard has other problems, some of his own making, some inherited from his predecessor, Lewis Slaton, who was district attorney for 31 years. Many experienced prosecutors left the office after Mr. Slaton retired three years ago. Although Mr. Howard has nearly doubled the number of lawyers on his staff, their caseloads have continued to explode. While the office's conviction rate has grown under Mr. Howard, himself a former assistant district attorney, many judges are exasperated by their enormous backlogs.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the killings, Mr. Howard appeared at a news conference and described Mr. Lewis as ''an active participant in this vicious crime.'' Standing with him was the mayor of Atlanta, Bill Campbell, who portrayed the perpetrators as ''literally dripping with blood.''</p>
        <p>With politicians and the police eager to reassure the public that Buckhead was safe, Mr. Howard pushed for a quick indictment of Mr. Lewis and his co-defendants. The move surprised many, particularly given the chaos of the scene outside a nightclub at 4 a.m. and the uncertainty about whether Mr. Lewis wielded a knife, threw punches or simply tried to break up the fight.</p>
        <p>By pursuing the quick indictment, Mr. Howard was able to circumvent a preliminary hearing that could have exposed the prosecution's strategy. But defense lawyers then demanded a speedy trial -- jury selection began on May 15, less than four months after the Jan. 31 killings -- and many criminal lawyers have speculated that the prosecution did not have time to prepare.</p>
        <p>As the testimony began, witness after witness backfired against the prosecution. One man, who had previously told the police he saw Mr. Lewis hitting one victim, called that account a mistake when he took the stand. The next day, Mr. Howard's key witness, Duane Fassett, Mr. Lewis's limousine chauffeur, drove a stake into the heart of the case.</p>
        <p>In statements to the police, Mr. Fassett said he saw Mr. Lewis punch one of the victims. He also said that when Mr. Lewis, Mr. Oakley and Mr. Sweeting returned to the limousine, he heard Mr. Oakley say, ''I stabbed mine,'' and heard Mr. Sweeting respond, ''I stabbed mine, too.''</p>
        <p>But on the witness stand, Mr. Fassett testified that he never saw Mr. Lewis throw a punch and that Mr. Lewis seemed to be trying to break up the fight. Mr. Howard then neglected to try to impeach Mr. Fassett's testimony by confronting him with his previous statements, an oversight that floored many criminal lawyers.</p>
        <p>''I almost fell over,'' said Jerome J. Froelich, a defense attorney here.</p>
        <p>In court today, Mr. Lewis testified that Mr. Sweeting had shown him, some time after the fight, how he had held a knife in his fist and jabbed repeatedly at one of the victims.</p>
        <p>''Every time they hit me, I hit them,'' Mr. Lewis quoted Mr. Sweeting as saying. But Mr. Lewis said he could not tell whether Mr. Sweeting or Mr. Oakley had stabbed anybody, and that neither Mr. Sweeting's knife nor his clothes were bloody.</p>
        <p>Mr. Howard said in an interview today that a murder charge may have been necessary to get Mr. Lewis to tell the truth. ''If we had not brought the indictment,'' he said, ''my view is this case might never have been solved.'' He said he had indicted Mr. Lewis primarily because of the pretrial statements made by Mr. Fassett.</p>
        <p>''Once a witness takes the stand,'' he said, ''the state can't control what he says.'' Mr. Howard said that he did the ethical thing in dismissing the murder charges after Mr. Fassett changed his story.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis's lawyers, however, accused Mr. Howard and Mayor Campbell of rushing to judgment in an effort to erase yet another blemish to Atlanta's image. Mr. Campbell did not return calls seeking comment today.</p>
        <p>''There was this sense that Atlanta again had a tragedy, and the external pressure of the publicity combined with political pressure to clear the city's name,'' said Edward T. M. Garland, who led Mr. Lewis's defense team. ''The mayor had no business standing up with Paul Howard at that press conference, and slandering Ray Lewis. They should have had a slow and careful investigation, but they didn't do it, and now it's blown up in their face.''</p>
