        <p>THE Internet has created a new shopping category: only on the Web. In other words, if you're in the market for some really oddball merchandise, don't head to the stores. Instead, sit at your terminal and click to a site like Tumbleweed Two Step (www.tumbleweedtwostep.com). Here you'll find tumbleweeds gathered from the Mojave Desert for $10 to $25 each, not including shipping.</p>
        <p>Neat freaks, or people who would gladly eat in restaurants every night of the week, should go straight to The Table Crumber (www.crumber.com). These handy gadgets, used to sweep crumbs off the table, come in more permutations than you can ever imagine, including one that is described as ''aircraft grade'' and another that can be monogrammed.</p>

        <p>Before going on a real-life shopping trip, take a spin through virtual space to the Unicycle Source, at www.unicycle source.com. Designed to appeal to both expert and beginner unicyclers, the site offers a wide variety of models, including historical replicas, a commuter version and an off-road series.</p>
        <p>Fans of miniature lighthouses should visit Sea-Lites Lighthouses. At its site, www.sea-lites.com, you will find model lighthouses in more than 10 styles, including Cape Hatteras, Assateague and Barnegat.</p>
        <p>It is also possible to customize a lighthouse. The models range from about 3 to 8 feet high, have curtains on the windows and are described as ''ideal for residential and commercial landscaping.'' And they all have flashing lights to warn passing ships.</p>
