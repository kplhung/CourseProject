        <p>THE ordering may be express, but the delivery often seems Pony Express. That is shaping up as a central issue in the highly competitive world of online shopping, and it is spawning creative solutions for getting the goods to customers more quickly.</p>
        <p>''I can order a book on my lunch break, but if I have to wait a week to get something, it becomes less valuable,'' said Stacey McCullough, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, in Cambridge, Mass., explaining the frustration that sends many potential online shoppers to the mall.</p>
        <p>Delivery delays are often attributed to the parcel carrier, but mishaps frequently occur before an order leaves the warehouse. Not that this matters to the customer, who knows only that the order did not arrive on time.</p>
        <p>The cost for such delays can be high. In a recent Boston Consulting Group study 19 percent of online customers said the delivery of their orders either took longer than they expected or never occurred. As a result, many stopped shopping online, while others simply refused to do more business with the offending e-tailer.</p>
        <p>Internet merchants hoping to build brand loyalty need to give customers much more than point-and-click ordering convenience, said George Shaheen, the chief executive of the online grocer Webvan, based in Foster City, Calif. ''Everybody thought that ordering was the secret sauce,'' he said. ''But if you're going to win over a large group to Internet shopping, you have to provide them a full shopping experience.''</p>
        <p>Theresia Gouw Ranzetta, a partner at Accel Partners, a venture capital firm in Palo Alto, Calif., added: ''We haven't figured out how to beam things, but that's sort of what people expect. The Internet has trained consumers that they should be able to access information anytime, anywhere.''</p>
        <p>To cope with customers' expectations in this fiercely competitive climate, many online retailers are redoubling their efforts to assure shoppers that every step is covered, from mouse to house. While they aren't yet zapping books and videos via modem directly to your computer, they are devising ways to deliver goods faster, better and more cheaply.</p>
        <p>Same-day service is already becoming a fixture in large metropolitan areas. For example, Barnesandnoble.com guarantees same-day delivery in Manhattan by 7 p.m. for Internet orders placed by 11 a.m. In Los Angeles and San Francisco, electronic items and toys ordered by 2 p.m. from the aptly named Sameday.com will arrive by 8 p.m. Other couriers with catchy monikers like Kozmo.com, Urbanfetch.com and Pinkdot.com deliver videos, ice cream and other convenience items store-to-door within an hour in large cities.</p>
        <p>Many sites are also providing precise information about when an order will ship and when it will arrive. Amazon.com has a feature on its site called ''Where's My Stuff?'' that allows customers to follow their orders in transit. Information is a powerful tool, and a customer who feels in charge is frequently a satisfied one. A high degree of personal communication and care seems especially important to shoppers in the cyber world, where orders and service lack face-to-face interaction.</p>
        <p>Behind the scenes, many e-tailers are taking control of crucial inventory and warehouse functions, trying to avoid delays. Filling orders quickly -- using sophisticated technology to get a shipment out of the warehouse and on the road -- has become an imperative for astute Internet merchants.</p>
        <p>''You have to have fresh information and the ability to track that information and keep abreast of the order,'' said Dennis Spina, the chief executive of SubmitOrder .com in Dublin, Ohio. The company is an online order-fulfillment provider for e-tailers that monitors inventory, processes orders and handles shipping, delivery and customer service.</p>
        <p>Most online merchants contract these back-office operations to independent providers like SubmitOrder, whose clients include BlueLight.com, the nascent Web venture of Kmart, and the toy seller Zany Brainy. Shippers like Federal Express and United Parcel Service are also billing themselves as one-stop e-commerce solutions. ''We know how to run a warehouse,'' said Harvey Rickles, the general manager of e-logistics for U.P.S. ''We have inventory management systems and tracking systems already in place.''</p>
        <p>Still, many of the more popular Internet retailers, including Amazon, Webvan and eToys, handle their own logistics. Webvan, for example, raised $275 million in a private placement of stock last year to build new distribution and fulfillment centers and expand its fleet of delivery trucks. Webvan operates two giant warehouses in or near each of its metropolitan markets -- the San Francisco Bay Area and Atlanta, -- that are stocked with perishables, dry goods, household products, beauty items, clothing, books, portable electronics, music CD's, and even pet supplies. Employees select and pack the orders and load the merchandise onto the company's small, distinctive delivery trucks.</p>
        <p>Many Webvan vehicles use Global Positioning Systems to guide drivers, a high-technology technique that ensures delivery  within a 30-minute window of the customer's choosing. By the end of the year, Webvan expects to do business in Chicago, Seattle, Baltimore and Bergen County, N.J. ''You have to keep in mind what the consumer wants,'' Mr. Shaheen said.</p>
        <p>Amazon is trying to enhance its seven merchandise-distribution centers. The company, based in Seattle, has been criticized for building such capital-intensive structures, but Jeff Wilke, the general manager for operations, said that Amazon's size required massive internal controls on inventory and orders. ''We could not deliver the same performance if we cobbled together some outsourced partners,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Amazon also intends to furnish same-day delivery for some top-selling products --  books, CD's and toys -- to customers through a partnership with Kozmo. (Last December, Amazon invested $60 million in Kozmo, which uses bicycle messengers in 10 cities to whisk movies, snacks and other easily carried items to urban dwellers.)</p>
        <p>CITY couriers like Kozmo and Urbanfetch store products close to their customers, much as Amazon or Webvan does, but on a reduced scale.</p>
        <p>Urbanfetch, which offers one-hour delivery in New York and will do so soon in London, taps a network of sites that stock its  electronics, beauty products, food, movies and CD's. And because couriers arrive at their destinations within minutes, customers do not need to juggle schedules or ask a neighbor for a favor.</p>
        <p>''The ability to schedule a delivery when you know you're going to be home becomes a real asset,'' said Ross Stevens, the chief executive of Urbanfetch, which is based in New York.</p>
        <p>Same-day delivery, or same hour? That choice will depend increasingly on the customer. And anyone who thinks that only city folk will relish these perks, take heart: Urbanfetch also owns the Internet name Suburbanfetch.com.</p>
