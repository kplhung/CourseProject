        <p>Pioneering aviator, best-selling writer and romantic idol, Antoine de Saint-Exupery enjoyed a celebrity in his lifetime that was surpassed only by his fame after death. With his mysterious disappearance during a military reconnaissance flight over occupied France on July 31, 1944, and then the worldwide success of his final book, ''The Little Prince,'' he assumed the status of myth, one that has kept the French in thrall ever since.</p>
        <p>Outside France the tall French aristocrat is still best remembered for the magic of ''The Little Prince,'' his illustrated fable of the boy traveler from asteroid B-612, which has so far sold some 50 million copies in 120</p>
        <p>languages. But in France, more than the author, it is Saint-Exupery the man who is revered, with the panache of his life and the sacrifice of his death constantly revisited by newspaper articles, books, exhibitions and even his image on the 50-franc bill.</p>
        <p>''He represents heroism, adventure and poetry,'' his great-niece, Nathalie des Vallieres, explained at the opening of a new exhibition, ''Antoine de Saint-Exupery: Celebration of a Myth,'' which is being presented through Nov. 20 in the crypt of the Pantheon in Paris to coincide with the centenary of his birth on June 29, 1900.</p>
        <p>Yet if this anniversary seemed like a ripe occasion for fresh commemoration, it has been unexpectedly disturbed by a voice from the past, that of Saint-Exupery's widow, Consuelo Suncin Sandoval, who died in 1979 and who even in her lifetime was largely extirpated from the approved version of Saint-Exupery's life. Now, with the publication of ''The Memoir of the Rose,'' her side of their stormy 13-year marriage has at last become known.</p>
        <p>Although she wrote the account in 1945, when her memories were still fresh, Ms. Suncin -- or the Countess of Saint-Exupery, as she liked to be known -- apparently never sought to publish it. Indeed, it is not clear whether anyone read it before her heir and former butler-cum-secretary, Jose Martinez Fructuoso, found it three years ago in an old trunk, along with photographs, letters and other documents from the 1930's and early 40's.</p>
        <p>Its publication during this anniversary year has predictably caused a sensation. The book, which went straight to the top of France's nonfiction best-seller list, has so far sold 55,000 copies here. It has thrown new light on both Saint-Exupery's complex personality and Ms. Suncin's role in his life and his writings. Above all, in 275 pages weighty with love, passion, betrayal and tragedy, the Salvadoran-born beauty has reclaimed her place in the Saint-Exupery myth.</p>
        <p>''The Consuelo-Saint-Exupery relationship is central to understanding the writer,'' noted Alain Vircondelet, a Saint-Exupery biographer who persuaded Mr. Martinez Fructuoso to release the manuscript for publication. ''Without Consuelo, would he really have been Saint-Exupery? What does it matter if the myth crumbles a bit, if the portrait presented here is not identical to the one so carefully prepared for eternity?''</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, Saint-Exupery's surviving family members -- the children and grandchildren of his sister, Gabrielle -- are not happy about Ms. Suncin's book and her portrayal of her husband as a philanderer who frequently abandoned her without explanation for lengthy periods. ''She doesn't say anything about her own lovers,'' Ms. des Vallieres said. ''She complains a lot, but she was always happy to take advantage of the Saint-Exupery name, even after his death.''</p>
        <p>Still, for all the family's sensitivity, Ms. Suncin's book is not an expose of her husband. Rather, it is a chronicle of their emotional ups and downs, starting with their meeting in Buenos Aires in 1930, when the twice-widowed 29-year-old Consuelo was literally swept into the air by Saint-Exupery: while flying loops over the city just hours after they met, the pilot announced that he loved her and wanted to marry her.</p>
        <p>By then, Saint-Exupery's career as a pilot flying around South America for a French-owned postal company was more advanced than his career as a writer. He had published his first book, ''Courrier Sud,'' or ''Southern Mail,'' in 1929, but he had already returned to France to marry Ms. Suncin when he became the toast of Paris in 1931 with ''Vol de Nuit,'' or ''Night Flight,'' a novel inspired by his adventures in the air over Argentina and Chile.</p>
        <p>While Ms. Suncin gives a rough idea of Saint-Exupery's comings and goings, however, she recounts her memoirs very much from her own point of view. She notes, for example, that Andre Gide, who wrote an introduction to ''Night Flight,'' referred to her disapprovingly in his journal. ''Saint-Exupery returned from Argentina with a new book and with a fiancee,'' Gide wrote. ''I read the book, I saw the other. I congratulated him, above all for the book.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Suncin's response is no kinder. ''He had a sugary voice, at times soft,'' she writes of Gide, ''the voice of a woman wasted by distress and unconsummated loves.'' She adds later: ''I tried to be agreeable and polite to him. What could I do if he didn't like me and preferred the company of men and old women?''</p>
        <p>Still, it is apparent that the flamboyant Latina was not warmly welcomed by her husband's social and intellectual circle. Instead, she grew accustomed to being left at home while Saint-Exupery went to dinners and parties in his honor. When she did join him, she would find him surrounded by beautiful women who resented her presence.</p>
        <p>His glory, she discovered, was not for sharing. ''Nothing is more personal to an artist than his creation,'' she writes. ''Even if you have given him your youth, your money, your love, your courage, nothing belongs to you.''</p>
        <p>Soon Saint-Exupery resumed the flying that provided him with the raw material for his writing, while Ms. Suncin's anxious waiting was now that of any pilot's wife in those early days of aviation. Saint-Exupery crashed into the Mediterranean in 1933 and in the Sahara in 1935. But Ms. Suncin eventually tired of her husband's long affair with a woman referred to only as E. and decided on divorce. But when she reached Guatemala by ship on her way home to El Salvador, she found Saint-Exupery in the hospital there, badly injured from yet another plane accident, this time while flying from New York to Tierra del Fuego.</p>
        <p>As the book moves through the late 1930's toward the outbreak of World War II, the German occupation of France, Saint-Exupery's departure for the United States and Ms. Suncin's later arrival there, the couple's pattern of breakups and reconciliations is well established.</p>
        <p>Ms. Suncin barely mentions many of her husband's books, including ''Flight to Arras,'' a major best seller in the United States in 1942, but it was nonetheless thanks to her that Saint-Exupery finally found the time and peace to write much of ''The Little Prince'' in a borrowed house in Northport, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the title of her own memoir shows that she was all too aware that Saint-Exupery imagined his wife to be the thorny red rose on asteroid B-612 with whom the little prince has such an ambivalent relationship (all the more so when the little prince discovers -- like Saint-Exupery -- that there are many beautiful roses on other planets). Before leaving to join the Free French Air Force in North Africa in 1943, however, he does promise that one day he will turn the thorny rose ''into the dream princess who always awaits the little prince.''</p>
        <p>After Saint-Exupery's death (neither his body nor his American-made P38 Lightning reconnaissance plane were ever found), she eventually returned to France to claim her half-share of his legacy. She published a book, ''Oppede,'' about her experience living in an artists' commune in a deserted hilltop town in southern France -- without Saint-Exupery -- during the early part of the German occupation. She took up painting as a career, and she assumed the mantle of the widow of the fallen hero. Of Saint-Exupery's family, only his mother, Marie, remained close to her.</p>
        <p>''He was her passion, the love of her life,'' recalled Mr. Martinez Fructuoso, who began working for Ms. Suncin in 1956. ''From the moment of Saint-Exupery's death, she was obsessed by him. But in the official story, she was a bit forgotten. There have been many biographies of Saint-Exupery, but they spoke little of her. Biographers wouldn't even come and interview her, yet she was the cornerstone of his life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Martinez Fructuoso, 65, who inherited Ms. Suncin's house in Grasse as well as the right to half the royalties from Saint-Exupery's books, said that the trunk where he found the manuscript of ''The Memoir of the Rose'' also contained many love letters from her husband that underlined the intensity of his feelings for her. While Mr. Martinez Fructuoso owns the letters, however, under French law only Saint-Exupery's direct relatives can authorize their publication. And so far they have expressed no interest in doing so.</p>
        <p>Indeed, for all the attention given to Ms. Suncin in recent weeks, with her own book coinciding with publication of an illustrated book by Mr. Vircondelet called, ''Saint-Exupery: Oh Consuelo,'' the Saint-Exupery family still seems far from embracing her. Asked why the exhibition organized by the family at the Pantheon includes only one small photograph of Ms. Suncin (standing by a rose named after her husband), Ms. des Vallieres answered: ''She wasn't a Saint-Exupery.''</p>
        <p>And yet if the myth of Saint-Exupery lives on, it may have less to do with books and photographs than with the French public's continuing fascination with tragic figures. Two years ago, a silver bracelet carrying Saint-Exupery's name -- and that of Consuelo, bizarrely in parentheses -- was pulled up in a fisherman's net, stirring endless debate and speculation. And in recent weeks, the discovery of two different sections of a P-38 Lightning in the sea off Marseille has suggested a fresh connection to the hero's death.</p>
        <p>''As 'The Marseillaise' puts it, we are always in search of the 'day of glory,''' said Alain Braun, who helped organize the exhibition in the Pantheon, itself the final resting place of France's great men (and one woman, Marie Curie). ''Saint-Exupery was like that. He was a star, a narcissist. He saw himself as a hero and a genius and decided to become a hero and a genius. And then he died for France.''</p>
