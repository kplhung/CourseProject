        <p>With great fanfare last week, AT&amp;T and the Federal Communications Commission announced that millions of telephone customers would see lower bills as the company passed on savings from a government-ordered reduction in the fees that long-distance companies pay to local phone companies.</p>
        <p>But on the day of the announcement, AT&amp;T also filed documents with the commission that said the company would actually be raising most of the per-minute charges on the basic accounts of millions of customers who make few calls, in some cases by as much as 163 percent.</p>

        <p>With great fanfare last week, AT&amp;T and the Federal Communications Commission announced that millions of telephone customers would see lower bills as the company passed on savings from a government-ordered reduction in the fees that long-distance companies pay to local phone companies.</p>
        <p>But on the day of the announcement, AT&amp;T also filed documents with the commission that said the company would actually be raising most of the per-minute charges on the basic accounts of millions of customers who make few calls, in some cases by as much as 163 percent.</p>
        <p>Moreover, AT&amp;T, the nation's largest long-distance company, said this week that it would be raising the monthly fee for some of its popular One Rate plans, which charge single per-minute long-distance rates, by 66 percent, to $5 from $3.</p>
        <p>Consumer groups said today that AT&amp;T, which controls 60 percent of the residential long-distance market, and officials at the F.C.C. had misled consumers by failing to disclose the rate increases when they announced the rate cuts last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''What was done by AT&amp;T and the F.C.C. was misleading and deceptive,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union. ''There's no question that there was an enormous exaggeration of the benefits of the new fee agreement that hid substantial rate increases at a time when the companies themselves are getting significant cost savings.''</p>
        <p>Commission officials said that they had known generally of AT&amp;T's proposed rate increases but that they were not troubled by them -- and felt no need to disclose them -- because the company agreed to send a letter to residential customers urging them to consider switching to lower-priced plans. While AT&amp;T and other long-distance companies are required by law to file statements with the F.C.C. when they adjust rates, the commission has no power to block the rate changes.</p>
        <p>''The new rates we have announced will be comparable or lower than the old basic rates,'' said Mark Siegel, a spokesman for AT&amp;T. ''The changes announced last week will not just benefit the low-end customer, but all customers.''</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T and F.C.C. officials last week trumpeted as ''historic'' the company's decision to drop its $3-a-month minimum fee charged to customers who make few or no long- distance calls, which on any given month represents more than a third of the company's residential subscribers. And, in fact, bills will drop by as much as 50 percent for those who make no long-distance calls.</p>
        <p>But because the new per-minute fees go up every day except Sunday, the consumer groups say bills will rise for many other low-volume callers.</p>
        <p>Mark N. Cooper, research director of the Consumer Federation of America, estimated that a customer who subscribed to the basic rate plan who made more than 12 minutes of monthly calls, following the national pattern for when those calls were made, would probably see a higher bill under the new plan.</p>
        <p>A customer who, for instance, made 45 minutes of long-distance calls on Saturday under the old basic plan would pay $4.95 at the old rate of 11 cents a minute, plus taxes and special fees. Under the new basic plan, that customer would pay $13.05, because calls on Saturday rise to 29 cents a minute, plus taxes and fees.</p>
        <p>But commission officials said that the marketplace would win out and that if AT&amp;T failed to offer the lowest-priced plans, customers could always switch to other long-distance services.</p>
        <p>''Any company that raises rates for their customers in this competitive marketplace will surely lose them,'' said Joy Howell, an F.C.C. spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>WorldCom and Sprint, the nation's second-  and third-largest long-distance companies, will also benefit from last week's agreement cutting the fees they pay to local phone companies to connect customers' calls, known as access charges.</p>
        <p>But unlike AT&amp;T, neither has filed a rate increase for its basic service in recent days. Sprint has said that it will pass along the savings from the access charges to customers. WorldCom has not made a similar commitment.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T executives vowed again today that they would pass on all savings from the reductions in access charges and that the proposed rate changes should not translate into larger bills because many customers would switch to new rate plans that could lower their bills.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T executives said the company would soon begin a consumer-education program in the form of a letter to be sent to all customers in the next few weeks, urging them to review their rate plans and consider changing to plans that may lower their bills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Siegel said that the company had not misled consumers and that it had disclosed its plans to raise per-minute rates in a news release last week. But the release put out by AT&amp;T on Wednesday, the day of the rate filing, made no mention of the increases in per-minute fees or the increases in some AT&amp;T One Rate plans. Instead, it spoke only of simplifying bills and congratulated the F.C.C. ''for its historic action today to reform and modernize the nation's access charge and universal service systems.</p>
        <p>''Consumers will benefit from the elimination of the minimum usage and carrier line charges,'' the news release said. ''AT&amp;T is restructuring its basic schedule, and consumers on this schedule who make few or no long-distance calls will benefit, realizing savings of approximately $3 to $4 per line, per month.''</p>
        <p>Under the old basic rate schedule, consumers paid a flat $3 a month minimum fee on top of per-minute charges that were determined based on when the call was placed. Off-peak calls, from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Monday through Friday, cost 16 cents a minute. Peak weekday calls cost 26 cents a minute, and weekend calls cost 11 cents a minute.</p>
        <p>Under the new rates disclosed in AT&amp;T's filing, the company will eliminate the monthly minimum. Calls made on Sunday, which represent about 21 percent of residential volume, will be cut to 7 cents a minute. Calls made any other time will rise to 29 cents a minute.</p>
        <p>F.C.C. officials said that they knew weeks ago that AT&amp;T planned to raise the per-minute charges on the basic plan but that they were not unduly concerned because the company promised to continue to offer a different basic plan in which a customer could pay a flat charge of 19 cents a minute for calls made at any time with no minimum or special fee.</p>
        <p>They said they did not know that the company had planned to increase the flat fee on some of the company's One Rate packages.</p>
