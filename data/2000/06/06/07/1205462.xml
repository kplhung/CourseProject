        <p>When Dee Anderson Payne was hired to manage the Washington office of Bessemer Trust in 1985, it consisted, she later stated in court papers, of a folding chair, a telephone and an empty slate of clients for Bessemer's investment-advisory services.</p>
        <p>Over the next 13 years, however, the office grew substantially, in large part through her efforts, Ms. Payne contended in a lawsuit she filed against the company last October. As a reward, she said, she was made an officer of the company in 1993 and an assistant vice president in 1995.</p>
        <p>But in early 1998, when another Bessemer employee was brought in to manage the office, Ms. Payne began to worry that she was being discriminated against because of her age and her sex.</p>
        <p>After numerous complaints and fearing she would not get a fair hearing in Bessemer's internal investigation, she informed the firm last June that she was considering filing age and sex discrimination complaints with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, according to the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Neither Ms. Payne nor her lawyer was apparently prepared for what happened next. In what legal experts said was a highly unusual move, Bessemer filed a suit against Ms. Payne in Federal District Court in Baltimore in July, a month before it completed its internal investigation and more than two months before Ms. Payne took legal action of her own.</p>
        <p>The company's suit asked the court to rule that it had not discriminated against Ms. Payne and ''to resolve'' what it described as her legal threats -- an apparent attempt to pressure her. Ms. Payne's lawyer and Bessemer would not comment on the suit, which was settled in April under a confidentiality agreement. But employment lawyers said the case illustrated a new combativeness in corporate America against litigation-minded employees.</p>
        <p>In the past, they said, companies would usually enter the legal arena only after an unhappy employee had filed a discrimination complaint with the employment opportunity agency, waited the requisite 180 days for the agency to review the case and then filed a lawsuit. Now, though, apparently concluding that a good offense is the best defense, an increasing number of employers are filing pre-emptive lawsuits aimed at scaring off potential plaintiffs.</p>
        <p>In some cases, like Ms. Payne's, employers go to court even as they are investigating an employee's discrimination complaints. (In court papers, Ms. Payne said, among other things, that she was denied the salary that was paid to men in positions like hers. She also said the new manager compared her to his elderly mother and told her on several occasions that he preferred hiring young employees.)</p>
        <p>In other cases, employment lawyers said, employers sue employees in the midst of settlement negotiations. And in others, they sue not only the employee but the employee's lawyer and law firm, a full-court press that some lawyers say amounts to intimidation.</p>
        <p>''I sense that companies are getting very heavy-handed in their approach,'' said Debra S. Katz, an employment lawyer at Bernabei &amp; Katz in Washington. John Hendrickson, a regional lawyer with the employment opportunity commission's Chicago office, added that until the last year he had not seen an employer-initiated pre-emptive suit in years. But now, he said, his office was involved in two such suits -- investigating one and challenging another.</p>
        <p>''These suits have a tremendous chilling effect,'' said Debra L. Raskin, an employment lawyer at Vladeck, Waldman, Elias &amp; Engelhard in Manhattan. ''Workplaces are small worlds where news of these suits -- even if they involve former employees -- is bound to get back to current employees.''</p>
        <p>While thousands of employees have complained that employers retaliated in some form after they had filed discrimination complaints, these kinds of lawsuits raise the stakes much higher.</p>
        <p>Susan Oxford, a lawyer for the employment opportunity agency in Washington, said pre-emptive suits appear in three basic guises: those aimed at protecting the internal arbitration process, those aimed at having a court absolve a company of wrongdoing and those aimed at putting employees on the legal defensive by accusing them of an offense like fraud, defamation or absconding with trade secrets.</p>
        <p>Ms. Oxford said the employment opportunity commission looks askance at all three but has its most serious quarrel with the third as an infringement of an employee's civil rights.</p>
        <p>''We feel strongly that these suits are one of the most unacceptable and outrageous forms of retaliation,'' she said. She added that the agency had already brought charges of unfair retaliation against two companies and would do so again when warranted.</p>
        <p>Many companies, however, defend their aggressive posture as a necessity in a litigation-mad society. David J. Shaffer, an employment-discrimination lawyer at Thelen Reid &amp; Priest in Washington, said an increasing number of in-house lawyers, human-resource managers and other high-level executives are filing discrimination and wrongful-termination actions these days, and companies sometimes feel they have to go to court to prevent such employees from disclosing confidential information.</p>
        <p>That was what motivated one of his clients, Microstrategy, a computer software maker in Vienna, Va., to file a pre-emptive lawsuit against an employee and her lawyer in March, he said. Betty J. Lauricia, a human-resources executive at Microstrategy, had filed complaints about sex and age discrimination as well as unfair compensation against the company with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Labor Department, and Microstrategy contended in its suit that Ms. Lauricia had given the agencies confidential information about its personnel and compensation practices. As a result of its concerns, it put Ms. Lauricia on paid leave and asked a court to rule that she had in fact absconded with trade secrets and that Microstrategy had the right to transfer her to another position.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lauricia's lawyer, Claude D. Convisser, said he and his client had been put under court orders not to talk about the case. But Mr. Shaffer said Ms. Lauricia's discrimination charges were ''completely meritless,'' and insisted that Microstrategy had no choice but to be tough.</p>
        <p>''We had no guarantee that our trade secrets were not floating around northern Virginia,'' Mr. Shaffer said.</p>
        <p>As another example of the hardball that employers can play, consider Norbert Pickett, an African-American who quit his job as a marketing agent with the Philadelphia Eagles football team in February 1999. In the early fall, Mr. Pickett filed discrimination complaints with both the federal employment opportunity commission and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, accusing his boss, David Rowan, and the Eagles of creating a racially hostile workplace.</p>
        <p>Among other things, Mr. Pickett said in his complaints, the Eagles had given two white sales representatives pay raises, even though they had not reached their sales goals, while Mr. Pickett had never received such a raise. He also said that Mr. Rowan had made obscene gestures to him that he had never seen him make to white Eagles employees. After he took his concerns to Mr. Rowan and another manager, Mr. Pickett said, he was put on probation, even though his white colleagues who had fallen short of their sales targets were not disciplined.</p>
        <p>Until late May this year, Mr. Pickett said, he and his lawyers thought they were actively engaged in settlement negotiations with the Eagles, according to his complaints. But then they discovered that Mr. Rowan with the help of a lawyer for the Eagles had filed a legal writ two months earlier aimed at preserving his right to make Mr. Pickett, his former lawyer and the lawyer's firm appear in court to answer accusations that they had engaged in libel, slander and misrepresentation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowan said that he had been falsely accused by Mr. Pickett and that he had filed the writ to protect himself and his family from potentially damaging publicity. He added that he had no intention of filing a lawsuit. Ron Howard, a spokesman for the Eagles, said that his organization had no comment on the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pickett said he was angered by the legal offensive. The action ''is a way to try to both pigeonhole me and damage my reputation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some employment lawyers say companies are only kidding themselves if they think such aggressive tactics tip the scales in their favor. ''These suits may seem like brilliant strike tactics,'' said Susan Ritz of the Manhattan firm Steel Bellman Ritz &amp; Clark. ''But they virtually guarantee longer and more expensive litigation times than simply resolving complaints some other way.''</p>
        <p>One much cited example was a pre-emptive lawsuit filed in November 1996 by Hooters of America against a female bartender who was threatening to file a sexual-discrimination complaint. The restaurant chain sought to compel her to resolve the dispute through arbitration, as it said her contract specified. Instead, the case dragged on for more than two years, led to a court ruling that arbitration procedures at Hooters were ''utterly lacking in the rudiments of evenhandedness'' and resulted ultimately in an out-of-court settlement.</p>
        <p>But probably the worst pre-emptive move a company could make, in Ms. Ritz's view, would be to sue an employee it had just fired. ''These cases may present a jury with the idea that an employee has been victimized twice,'' she said. ''Not only were they fired without cause, but now they're being asked to fight a lawsuit by their employer.''</p>
