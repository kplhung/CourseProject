        <p>FOR directors of independent funeral homes, it means the chance to get the same discounts on coffins that the chains get. To the owner of five convenience stores in Mississippi, it opens doors to expansion. A private investigator near Cincinnati has found better prices on office supplies and T-shirts.</p>
        <p>Individually, small businesses may seem like small potatoes, but as a whole, they are increasingly seen as a big deal when it comes to business-to-business transactions on the Internet. A myriad of dot-com companies are developing marketplaces and services to give small businesses the same opportunities available to corporations like the Big Three automakers.</p>
        <p>''Suddenly, the whole world can be your territory,'' said Bruce Richardson, a senior vice president at AMR Research Inc., an industry and market analysis firm in Boston specializing in e-business strategy and infrastructure. ''You know the saying, 'On the Internet, no one knows you're a dog.' It's sort of been the great equalizer.''</p>
        <p>Over the last year, Internet-based business exchanges, e-marketplaces and free and fee-based business services have proliferated for small and midsize businesses.</p>
        <p>Even so, the field is ''not out of diapers,'' said Thomas M. Koulopoulos, the president and founder of Delphi Group, an advisory company specializing in business and technology. He and other analysts think it will be three to five years before these exchanges become serious e-commerce operations.</p>
        <p>But with most things related to the Internet, where growth and consolidation happen almost simultaneously, time is of the essence as marketplaces vie to organize the buyers and sellers that will determine the success of these ventures. While big businesses with well-established supply chains have an advantage, the sheer magnitude of small business -- there are 5.5 million businesses with fewer than 500 employees in the United States -- makes them an attractive group to organize.</p>
        <p>The likely result, Mr. Koulopoulos said, ''is a pecking order, a hierarchy of exchanges.''</p>
        <p>At the top are exchanges controlled by big corporations, like automakers, which broaden into smaller business sectors that are just beginning to form. The creation of such markets is viewed as an opportunity to fundamentally change the way small businesses operate.</p>
        <p>But while the potential is there, many small businesses lack the equipment and ability to participate fully. For companies trying to establish marketplaces, that can mean providing a little help.</p>
        <p>For example, GlobalSupplyNet.com, a company that organizes the janitorial supply industry, is providing some of its clients with the computers they need to participate and initially allowing them to use the service at no cost.</p>
        <p>They see the highly fragmented business as the perfect target. ''It's a $32 billion industry, and they're all little players,'' said Steven Odzer, the company's founder. ''These people want to use the Internet, but they have no one to help them.''</p>
        <p>While organizing marketplaces is the main goal of many companies, many small businesses are entering the marketplaces piecemeal, often as buyers looking for better prices on supplies.</p>
        <p>Joe Ryan, a private investigator in the Cincinnati area who has a family-run business called Investigative Concepts, turned to Mondus.com, an e-marketplace geared to small and midsize businesses, to see whether he could save money in purchasing.</p>
        <p>Mondus allows businesses to obtain competitive quotes on goods and services. Mr. Ryan estimated that he saved about half of what he had normally spent on items like envelopes and stationery.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a Microsoft, but I feel like a Fortune 500 company now because I'm being looked at instead of being passed over because they don't think they'll make much money off me,'' Mr. Ryan said.</p>
        <p>For Malcolm Carmichael, the vice president of a family-owned business that operates five convenience stores near Laurel, Miss., the Internet has offered a means to eliminate the voluminous paperwork for inventory and bookkeeping. The task was eating up hours of manpower and keeping the company from expanding.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carmichael said that he had looked at stand-alone systems to link his stores, but  they would have cost $50,000 to $80,000 to build, not including upkeep. But through a recent Internet offering called Storereport .com, he has accomplished the same connection for $99 a month for each store with an investment of less than $4,000 in computers.</p>
        <p>''This system, by itself, cuts back 10 hours a day,'' said Mr. Carmichael, who is now envisioning a time when he will be able to do all his ordering online as well.</p>
        <p>But Storereport is also a good example of the ambitions being built on the small-business market. Bill Scott, who created the site, wants to do more than link stores to process their paperwork. His goal is to create a Web market to serve oil marketers and gas-station and convenience-store operators. ''If we had 35,000 convenience stores online, we'd be in a position to do that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Scott has five customers with  20 convenience stores, most of which also sell gasoline. He hopes that his expertise in technology will help him organize the market, but competition will most likely be fierce. Five other groups, including the National Association of Convenience Stores,  would like to do the same thing, he said.</p>
        <p>Finding an established group to build on is becoming increasingly important for companies setting up business-to-business operations. While analysts estimate that more than 600 business exchanges are operating on the Internet, they predict that number will shrink to fewer than 100 by 2001 because independent exchanges have found it hard to attract and control business.</p>
        <p>Aatlas Commerce, for example, has focused on providing the technology to unite buying groups like funeral directors and horse-racing breeders and track operators.  For example, independent funeral directors have found it increasingly difficult to compete against corporations, which receive significant discounts when they buy in large quantities. Through the Independent Funeral Directors Cooperative, which was formed with the National Selected Morticians, a trade group representing independent funeral directors, they plan to even that playing field.</p>
        <p>''This has the potential of giving me the same buying power as the people I compete with,'' said Steve Ryan, an independent funeral home director in Salina, Kan.</p>
        <p>He acknowledges, however, that there are some challenges ahead. Funeral directors need to be trained to use the Internet, relationships must be developed with suppliers and distribution channels need to be established. ''We're not that far removed from having the salesman come in and hold our hand,'' Steve Ryan said.</p>
        <p>But organizers of such buying cooperatives say they benefit from having an established buying base on which to build.</p>
        <p>EquiSource, which set up an Internet marketplace for the thoroughbred racing industry, grew out of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association's desire for group purchasing.</p>
        <p>Vinery, a thoroughbred breeding operation in Lexington, Ky., has purchased a few  items for farm equipment and fences, saving about 10 percent to 12 percent on each fence board, said Dan Pride, sales coordinator of Vinery.</p>
        <p>Although the farm must rely on suppliers who are available through the platform, Mr. Pride said, ''we view that as the trade-off between someone else doing all the homework, making an informed decision and offering it at a discount.''</p>
        <p>Despite the doors being opened, the jumble of offerings and shifting playing fields can make it difficult for small businesses to find what works for them.</p>
        <p>''The hardest part is finding these sites,'' said Maria Barreros, the business development manager at KNC Marketing, the company Investigative Concepts used for its T-shirt purchase on the Mondus site.</p>
        <p>Ms. Barreros has sold excess inventory on eBay, scoured government purchasing sites and used eLance.com and Mondus.com. But it can still be difficult to find what you need, she said, and it can be easy for a small business to get overlooked when selling.</p>
        <p>''I know my boss believes that if we're not in this within the next couple of years, we'd be out of business,'' Ms. Barreros said. ''But at this time it hasn't made a big impact. It's just slightly changing the ways we do business.''</p>
