        <p>THE business plan has not changed much in the nearly 30 years since Wright Gore Jr. began working for his family's shrimp supply company, Western Seafood. Shrimpers working the Gulf of Mexico sell their catch to Western, which processes and packages it. A broker for Western then solicits customers, mostly wholesalers from the Eastern seaboard, who, in turn, sell to restaurants, hotels and other retailers.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Mr. Gore's shrimp wind up as appetizers in Manhattan and Chicago.</p>
        <p>But about 18 months ago, representatives from an Internet company, Gofish.com, sat on the couch in Mr. Gore's office here on the Gulf Coast and promised a revolution in the fish business. ''They walked in here and told us that was going to be the thing of the future,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The future hasn't come quite as quickly as they anticipated. But they are enthusiastic.''</p>
        <p>For now, the $350 billion seafood industry operates much as it always has, which is to say without a great deal of coherence. Unlike commodities that are traded on exchanges, the seafood industry is really an amalgamation of a range of businesses that have never had centralized clearinghouses.</p>
        <p>Yet a flurry of online trading sites suggests that change is coming very fast. A dozen or more companies now provide business-to-business services; these include Gofish.com and Fishmonger.com, the early leaders in establishing online sites for the buying and selling of seafood.</p>
        <p>Fundamental questions remain unanswered: Will prices be affected? Will buyers and sellers forsake the old layered system and use the Internet more than seafood brokers? Richard Gutting Jr., president of the National Fisheries Institute, a leading industry trade group, said the pace of change was rapid as new companies searched for online niches.</p>
        <p>''Almost every day or every week there seems to be another company,'' Mr. Gutting said. ''They all have different business plans, slightly different services. We are being overwhelmed.''</p>
        <p>The most ambitious sites are trying to establish exchanges that could reshape the way seafood goes from ocean to table. At  Gofish.com in Portland, Me., the company's founder, Neal Workman, envisions the site as ''a central meeting place'' where buyers and sellers from around the world can gather industry news, check the inventory of anything from frog legs to tilapia, and, most significantly, buy and sell seafood.</p>
        <p>Because fish is perishable and because companies could end up doing business with strangers, Mr. Workman said establishing the right safeguards was essential. Every company using the site must submit to a credit report conducted by Gofish's sister company, Seafax, which is considered an industry leader in credit checks. And the companies also pay annual membership fees as high as $3,500.</p>
        <p>In exchange, Gofish essentially guarantees the transaction by providing insurance and offering immediate financing. Mr. Workman said seafood companies were usually paid about 42 days after a sale. But Gofish offers to pay the seller up to 80 percent of the sale price within 48 hours. Buyers, meanwhile, benefit from a larger choice of sellers.</p>
        <p>In plain talk, of course, Gofish is proposing to cut out the middleman -- or replace a whole string of them with just itself -- by connecting sellers directly to buyers. The first test of the popularity of such online companies is likely to come this summer, the busy season for industries like shrimping. As yet, more than $500 million in seafood is listed for sale on Gofish, far ahead of its own projections, though the company has recorded only a limited number of sales.</p>
        <p>''Our No. 1 competitor in this whole business is inertia,'' Mr. Workman said.</p>
        <p>Barry Rubenstein is one of the middlemen whom Gofish and other companies want to replace. He is a seafood broker in Dallas who represents more than 100 suppliers, including Western Seafood. In connecting sellers like Western with buyers nationwide, Mr. Rubenstein said he offers expertise and saves sellers huge amounts of time. He warns that eliminating ''verbal contact'' could cause serious problems, but he does not delude himself about the future.</p>
        <p>''If it boils down to sending e-mails,'' Mr. Rubenstein said, ''my job could be eliminated.'' He added, ''The next generation of buyers will probably go the route I'm trying to fight. They were born with the computer. They were using it in kindergarten.''</p>
        <p>Inside his office, Mr. Gore can peruse seafood prices on the Internet and look through his window and see the rusted shrimp trawlers docked near the mouth of the Brazos River not far from the Gulf.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore acknowledges he is uncertain how effective online exchanges will be. His company supplies about five million pounds of shrimp a year, and he considers his company's reputation an important attribute.</p>
        <p>In an industry built on relationships, he wonders, for example, how an online buyer will be able to differentiate the quality of his shrimp from that of someone else's. He relies on his broker to lobby wholesalers on his behalf. Earlier this month, he listed 2,500 pounds of medium-size shrimp on Gofish at $10.50 a pound. He did not get a nibble from a buyer.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Gore joked gently, ''The broker made quite a few sales this week, though.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Gore also understands that the worst mistake he can make is failing to anticipate the future. So, like more and more seafood company executives, he is cautiously entering cyberspace. ''I don't want to leave any rock unturned,'' he said. ''I don't intend for this or anything else to run off and leave me if I can help it.''</p>
