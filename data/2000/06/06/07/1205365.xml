        <p>IN the early rounds of the online banking competition, the surprising outcome is that the big commercial banks have not been beaten to the punch by nimbler young challengers.</p>
        <p>Unlike the brokerage titans of Wall Street that steadfastly refused to recognize the threat posed by Internet-based stock trading competitors, commercial banks have been wrestling with the Web for years. But the results of those efforts, many of which were primarily defensive, have ranged from modest success to spectacular failure.</p>
        <p>It turns out that, unlike online stock trading, online banking has not, so far, been a killer app. Consumers have been just as slow as the banks to accept the Internet as a medium for managing everyday money matters.</p>
        <p>Less than 10 percent of American consumers bank online. Last year, about 8.3 million people shopped the Internet for mortgages and other loans, but only one in eight even started the loan application process online, said Robert Sterling, an analyst with Jupiter Communications in New York.</p>
        <p>The real challenge to established banks may just be arriving, in the form of companies that combine banking with other services online. Control of consumers' financial information is so critical to establishing bonds with them that it has attracted a host of competitors, including purely electronic banks, brokerage firms and software companies that operate Internet portals.</p>
        <p>For example, E*Trade Group, the electronic brokerage firm, is making a big push for its E*Trade Bank, which was known as Telebank before E*Trade bought it earlier this year. E*Trade also bought a network of more than 8,800 automated teller machines to establish its first physical presence across the country. The company eventually hopes to link those A.T.M.'s with its Web sites so that customers can withdraw cash from bank or brokerage accounts.</p>
        <p>Traditional banks take some comfort in E*Trade's moves because they reinforce the belief that Internet-only banks have limited appeal. When it comes to their savings, most people demand that there be some there there, as the saying goes.</p>
        <p>''The advent of Net-only banks seems so exciting,'' said Bruce Zimmerman, a senior vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank. ''The reality is, there aren't many customers who want to do everything only over the Net. That's why you've seen that Net-only models haven't been successful.''</p>
        <p>To build business quickly, most Internet banks have taken advantage of their slim cost structures by paying higher interest rates on checking accounts and certificates of deposit. E*Trade Bank started early this year with a one-year C.D. that yielded 7.27 percent on an investment of as little as $1,000, compared with 5.7 percent at Citibank in New York and 5.15 percent at Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>
        <p>But, analysts say, paying above-market rates to attract deposits has never been a path to profits. Indeed, that tactic contributed to the failure of many savings and loans in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>''The bad idea of the decade for online bank marketing is competitive C.D. rates online,'' Mr. Sterling said. The people most likely to shop for the best rates are retirees, and they are unlikely to shop online, he said.</p>
        <p>Among Internet banks, the most visible disappointment has been WingspanBank .com, the electronic bank created by the Bank One Corporation. After spending about $35 million on advertising for Wingspan, Bank One put it up for sale.</p>
        <p>Citigroup's Citibank has also struggled with its Internet strategy. Even with its latest electronic offering, called Citi f/i,  Citibank, the nation's largest bank, trails Wells Fargo and Bank of America in the number of online accounts.</p>
        <p>After the initial trials of the all-electronic bank model, Mr. Sterling said, ''There's one verdict in, and it ain't the next E*Trade.''</p>
        <p>There are several reasons for the slower migration online for bank customers compared with investors, according to analysts and industry executives. One of the most important is that electronic discount brokerages opened up a simple, affordable route for millions of people to invest. Another is that investors were not accustomed to visiting brokerage offices with any regularity, while many bank customers still stop at their neighborhood branch at least once a week.</p>
        <p>Electronic banks can offer better interest rates on deposits and loans because they have virtually no overhead compared with traditional banks. But banks' costly clusters of branches are still valuable assets, analysts say.</p>
        <p>''The fact that a bank has a physical branch in the vicinity of a prospect is an enormous advantage and will remain an enormous advantage,'' Mr. Sterling said. ''A local presence implies solidity, whereas anybody can set up a Web site.''</p>
        <p>BIG banks are following a trail that was blazed in the brokerage business by Charles Schwab: they are working toward making their services available online, over the phone and in person.</p>
        <p>''We believe people will want a choice of how they access the bank,'' Mr. Zimmerman said. ''And we believe customers will value a seamless financial relationship.''</p>
        <p>Things are not so smooth just yet. Traditional banks are ahead of the game if they have made all account information accessible to customers online, said Matt Cone, senior vice president of marketing for the Corillian Corporation, a provider of Internet banking software in Portland, Ore. ''There are a number of financial institutions that still have yet to get to first base,'' Mr. Cone said. Many banks had put off their Internet ambitions until they had updated their computer systems for the Year 2000, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cone said that making account information available electronically was a step toward offering what customers really want: a single, online source of up-to-date information about their finances, including savings and checking accounts, credit cards, mutual funds and other investments.</p>
        <p>On that score, banks are facing new challengers: upstarts that want to give people one place on the Web where they can check on accounts scattered among several companies, from savings at a bank to brokerage accounts to frequent-flier mileage.</p>
        <p>Several companies, like Yodlee.com and X.com, are offering to gather account information from disparate sources and compile it for a quick survey. The technology that these companies use is known as ''screen scraping'' because it requires them to use customers' account numbers and passwords to collect confidential data posted by other companies.</p>
        <p>Banks are hoping that most consumers will not trust any other company, especially new dot-com ventures, with access to such important personal information.</p>
        <p>The buzzwords at Chase Manhattan these days are ''real-time,'' ''connected'' and ''personalized,'' Mr. Zimmerman said.  Chase Manhattan is working toward immediate recognition of deposits, withdrawals and transfers between accounts, he said, because ''one of the expectations of the Internet is that everything be real time. The Internet enables, and therefore the customer expects, everything to be connected.'' But like most banks, even E*Trade Bank, Chase Manhattan still uses batch processing every evening to process the daily transactions and update balances in customer accounts.</p>
        <p>The faith that most consumers place in traditional banks is a powerful competitive advantage, Mr. Cone said. ''The problem banks have had historically is that they rely on that and so they could take their sweet time to get there.''</p>
