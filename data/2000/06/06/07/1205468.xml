      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Pataki administration has given its blessing to a controversial gas-fired power plant just inland from the western shore of the Hudson River near the town of Athens in Green County, 120 miles north of New York City. The decision disappointed conservationists, who have fought the plant in part because it threatened to disfigure a landscape that had inspired some of the great paintings of the 19th-century Hudson River School. They argued, as did this page, that it should be located elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But the plant's critics did not emerge empty-handed. The ruckus they stirred helped persuade the Pataki administration to impose tough restrictions on the plant's owner, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, forcing it to build a far more environmentally friendly plant than first contemplated. The plant is also likely to set the standard for any new power plants in New York.</p>

        <p>The Pataki administration has given its blessing to a controversial gas-fired power plant just inland from the western shore of the Hudson River near the town of Athens in Green County, 120 miles north of New York City. The decision disappointed conservationists, who have fought the plant in part because it threatened to disfigure a landscape that had inspired some of the great paintings of the 19th-century Hudson River School. They argued, as did this page, that it should be located elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But the plant's critics did not emerge empty-handed. The ruckus they stirred helped persuade the Pataki administration to impose tough restrictions on the plant's owner, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, forcing it to build a far more environmentally friendly plant than first contemplated. The plant is also likely to set the standard for any new power plants in New York.</p>
        <p>The key restriction will require the plant to install an advanced system known as ''dry cooling,'' under which the plant is cooled largely by recycled water. Most conventional power plants -- whether nuclear, coal-fired or gas-fired, as this one will be -- use large quantities of water. The water intake pipes can kill huge numbers of fish. They also discharge heated water that can play havoc with a river's ecological balance.</p>
        <p>The Athens plant would originally have sucked four million gallons of water a day from the Hudson. Using dry cooling, it will tap only 180,000 gallons a day. Since that amount of water can easily be found in smaller sources like a municipal water supply, it should be possible to locate future plants in places other than the Hudson, which has received more than its share of abuse over the years. Dry cooling will also help reduce the plant's visual impact by eliminating the need for cooling towers and the huge plumes of steam that rise from these towers.</p>
        <p>But there is one more step the Pataki administration can take to mollify the conservationists. That is to develop a rational strategy for the siting of new power plants throughout the state, identifying which sites make sense environmentally. Gov. George Pataki has done much to clean up New York's existing power plants. His task now is to develop a smart policy for the next generation of plants.</p>
