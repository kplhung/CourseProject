        <p>THE one major hassle in making pot-stickers is the dough. All it takes is flour and water, and you can knead it in a food processor, but there's a long resting period followed by the ultimate in tedium: rolling out several dozen two-inch circles, each  taking a couple of minutes. Once you're finished you still face a half-hour or more of active labor to fill and cook them.</p>
        <p>What can make pot-stickers a minimalist dish? One approach is called takeout and is already quite common. The alternative is using the wrappers now sold in just about every supermarket.</p>
        <p>Start with those, and a filling of ground pork, cabbage, scallions, ginger and garlic can be put together in less than 10 minutes. Filling each wrapper takes about 30 seconds once you get the hang of it. Cooking pot-stickers takes less than 10 minutes. And assembling a three-ingredient dipping sauce adds another five minutes or so to the process.</p>
        <p>Folding the dumplings is almost intuitive, and sealing them is just a matter of brushing an edge of the dough with a little beaten egg. (Water also works as glue but not quite as well.) Always buy round wrappers; squares do not wrap as tidily.</p>
        <p>The cooking technique is unusual but simple: brown the dumplings for a couple of minutes in oil, then add a little water; cover for three or four minutes, then uncover and finish browning. Essentially, they are sauteed-steamed-sauteed, producing a crisp bottom, a tender top and a thoroughly cooked interior.</p>
        <p>Use any filling you like. Ground pork, beef, chicken, turkey or lamb tastes most familiar. For a vegetarian pot-sticker, cabbage can dominate, complemented by chopped shiitakes, minced tofu, minced celery and carrots, chives or a combination. Shrimp dumplings are also great.</p>
        <p>FAST POT-STICKERS  Time: 1 hour or less</p>
        <p>3/4 pound ground pork or other meat  1 cup minced cabbage  2 tablespoons minced ginger  1 tablespoons minced garlic  6 scallions, the white and green parts separated, both minced</p>
        <p>1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons good soy sauce  48 dumpling wrappers  1 egg, lightly beaten in a bowl  4 tablespoons peanut oil or vegetable oil, more or less</p>
        <p>1/4 cup rice vinegar or white vinegar.</p>
        <p>1. Combine meat, cabbage, ginger, garlic, scallion whites and 2 tablespoons soy sauce in a bowl with  1/4 cup water. Lay a wrapper on a clean, dry surface, and using your finger or a brush, spread a bit of egg along half of its circumference. Place a rounded teaspoon of filling in center, fold over and seal by pinching edges together. (Do not overfill.) Place dumplings on a plate; if you want to wait a few hours before cooking, cover plate with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Or freeze, for up to two weeks.</p>
        <p>2. To cook, put about 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet and turn heat to medium-high. A minute later, add dumplings, one at a time; they can touch one another, but should still sit flat in one layer. Cook about 2 minutes, or until bottoms are lightly browned. Add  1/4 cup water per dozen dumplings to pan, and cover. Lower heat to medium, and let simmer about 3 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. To make the dipping sauce, combine remaining soy sauce, green parts of scallions and vinegar.</p>
        <p>4. Uncover dumplings, return heat to medium-high and cook another minute or two, until bottoms are dark brown and crisp and water  evaporates. (Use more oil if necessary.) Serve hot, with sauce.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 main-course or 8 appetizer servings.</p>
        <p>Vegetarian Pot-Stickers: Make a filling of 2 cups minced cabbage, 1 cup minced shiitake caps,  1/2 cup minced scallions or chives, and ginger, garlic and soy as above (omit water).</p>
        <p>Shrimp Pot-Stickers: Make a filling of 2 cups peeled and minced shrimp (about 1 pound unpeeled),  1/2 cup minced snow peas,  1/2 cup minced shallots, and ginger, garlic and soy as above. Add 1 tablespoon sesame oil (or 1 tablespoon minced bacon).</p>
