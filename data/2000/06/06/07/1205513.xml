        <p>The New York State Department of Insurance has begun an investigation into reports that for decades some life insurance companies in the state discriminated against blacks and other minority members by charging them higher premiums than white customers.</p>
        <p>Neil D. Levin, the state superintendent of insurance, said last night that there were no indications that discriminatory rates were still being charged by the more than 50 insurers selling policies in New York. But he said it was not clear whether some customers were still paying discriminatory premiums on policies written long ago and whether inadequate death benefits from some of these policies might have been paid in recent years.</p>
        <p>After making initial inquiries at four insurance companies, Mr. Levin said, he decided to order all the life insurers in the state to provide detailed written reports on whether they discriminated against blacks and other minority members, how they did so and if and when those practices were halted. He would not name the four companies.</p>
        <p>''We had preliminary conversations with some of the largest insurance writers in the state,'' said Kevin M. Rampe, general counsel of the insurance department, ''that gave us cause and reason to believe that these practices did take place in New York and that it wasn't just a problem of the past but that it may be affecting people today.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin said he decided to look into the matter after reading a report in The Wall Street Journal about widespread discrimination of blacks by life insurance companies in other states. Mr. Rampe said that after inquiries had been made at one company, others came forward with information implicating other companies.</p>
