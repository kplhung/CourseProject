        <p>For those expecting caviar and lobster tails, the celebratory bash marking Jon S. Corzine's Senate primary victory tonight was something of a disappointment. Mr. Corzine, a Wall Street financier who poured a record amount of money into his campaign, did not hand out $100 bills at the door. There were no loot bags for departing revelers and the buffet tables were filled with fried shrimp, nachos and the usual assortment of catered finger foods.</p>
        <p>But compared with Jim Florio, whose primary night event featured a cash bar and no food, Mr. Corzine's party was a sumptuous affair. An imperfect metaphor, perhaps, but in the end, Mr. Florio, the former governor, could not overcome Mr. Corzine's millions and his own legacy as the man who gave New Jersey a $2.8 billion tax increase.</p>

        <p>For those expecting caviar and lobster tails, the celebratory bash marking Jon S. Corzine's Senate primary victory tonight was something of a disappointment. Mr. Corzine, a Wall Street financier who poured a record amount of money into his campaign, did not hand out $100 bills at the door. There were no loot bags for departing revelers and the buffet tables were filled with fried shrimp, nachos and the usual assortment of catered finger foods.</p>
        <p>But compared with Jim Florio, whose primary night event featured a cash bar and no food, Mr. Corzine's party was a sumptuous affair. An imperfect metaphor, perhaps, but in the end, Mr. Florio, the former governor, could not overcome Mr. Corzine's millions and his own legacy as the man who gave New Jersey a $2.8 billion tax increase.</p>
        <p>Flanked by his family and Frank J. Lautenberg, the retiring senator whose seat he hopes to win in November, Mr. Corzine thanked his supporters and praised Mr. Florio for his ''leadership and long commitment to public service.''</p>
        <p>Standing over an exuberant crowd in the ballroom of the Hilton Hotel here, Mr. Corzine's discomfort with his newfound celebrity was apparent. He had a hard time speaking into  the microphone and frequently lowered his head when cheers erupted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine spent $35 million of his own money on the race, compared with Mr. Florio's $2 million.</p>
        <p>''I can't express how strongly, how emotionally I feel,'' Mr. Corzine said haltingly. ''But let me make clear that we have only just begun.''</p>
        <p>After conceding defeat shortly after 10:30 p.m., Mr. Florio addressed a crowd of 200 at the Sheraton Hotel in Cherry Hill. He called the race ''tough and spirited,'' thanked his supporters and encouraged them to support Mr. Corzine against the Republican challenger. But he said he hoped that his defeat would have a positive effect on American politics.</p>
        <p>''I think this campaign will stand as a lasting monument in some respects for the need to have real campaign finance reform,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As word of Mr. Corzine's victory spread, a conga line of supporters snaked through the crowd at the Hilton. A six-piece band played wedding-party classics and the decor was an understated assortment of the red, white and blue balloons floating above the dance floor. Two large screens on either side of the stage silently played Mr. Corzine's repertoire of television ads. Steven Goldstein, the co-campaign manager, said the results proved that the electorate was not bothered by Mr. Corzine's generously self-funded candidacy. ''The voters of New Jersey don't care about the money that comes from a candidate's pockets,'' he said. ''They care about the ideas that come from his heart.''</p>
        <p>The race was fiercely contested and, in the final weeks, relentlessly negative.</p>
        <p>Although voter turnout was low, few New Jersey residents could escape the bombardment of television ads, mailings and roadside billboards, the vast majority of them selling Mr. Corzine's candidacy. At its peak, his campaign was spending $2 million a week on television commercials, many of them attacking Mr. Florio for his tax increase as governor and for votes he cast as a congressman that, Mr. Corzine contended, weakened Social Security.</p>
        <p>When he could afford the air time, Mr. Florio portrayed his rival as a greedy businessman whose former employer, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, promoted human suffering in its drive for profits. Toward the end of the campaign, Mr. Florio's supporters mailed a brochure to black voters accusing Mr. Corzine of promoting slavery in Africa, saying he had brokered a business deal in Sudan that led to the enslavement of people in that country's civil war.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Florio's persistent cries of foul play, he seemed unable to make Mr. Corzine's shortcomings more impressive than his own. The Corzine campaign reminded voters about Mr. Florio's tax increase, which he pushed through in 1990.</p>
        <p>The state's Democratic leaders, most of whom had endorsed Mr. Corzine, did not need their memories jogged. Some said they were still seething over the reaction to the tax increase, which led to a Republican takeover of the Legislature. Many said they were concerned that Mr. Florio's tax albatross had made him unelectable. Others privately admitted that they were moved by Mr. Corzine's millions, some of which made their way into Democratic Party treasuries across the state.</p>
        <p>But most voters, it seemed, were thinking of their own wallets. Jim Crowe, 66, a retired electronic technician, said he had supported Mr. Florio for governor, but now blamed him for reduced retirement savings. ''I wanted to vote against Mr. Florio because he stiffed me when I retired, taxwise,'' he said. ''I bear grudges when it comes to my wallet.''</p>
        <p>Others said they heeded the anti-Florio message they saw on television. Estelle Finch, 70, a nursery school teacher in Newark, said the commercials had convinced her that a Senator Florio would hurt Medicaid and Social Security. ''I just don't trust him with my future,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Gerald Pomper, a political science professor at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, said Mr. Florio had underestimated the widespread antipathy. ''All someone had to do is offer a credible alternative, and Jon Corzine did,'' he said. ''Though I'm not sure he had to spend $30 million to do it.''</p>
