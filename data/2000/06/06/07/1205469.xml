        <p>In a spirited final filing, Microsoft yesterday condemned the government's plan to split the company in two as ''a radical step'' that seemed to treat software as if it were pornography.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's brief denounced the government's breakup plan as ''completely obscure'' for failing to clearly define Internet software.</p>
        <p>''While it may suffice in defining pornography for purposes of regulating obscenity, 'I know it when I see it' does not provide a workable basis for defining critical terms in an injunction,'' the brief stated.</p>
        <p>Microsoft also warned that the government's plan could prompt an exodus of engineers from the company, as these precise professionals give up in frustration. ''Faced with the prospect of certifying that they understand something they do not'' -- namely the provisions of the government plan -- ''many Microsoft employees might choose to resign instead,'' the legal brief said.</p>
        <p>The Microsoft filing, which came a day before the Wednesday deadline, is the last step before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson rules on the appropriate remedies in the case. The judge's order is expected within days. By now, there are no new points or themes from either side in the Microsoft antitrust suit, which was filed in May 1998. All that is left is room for a bit of rhetorical innovation, as Microsoft displayed yesterday.</p>
        <p>The eight-page brief by Microsoft will have little impact on the next step in the case. Judge Jackson is expected to approve the essence of the plan by the Justice Department and states suing Microsoft to break the company in two and restrict its corporate behavior.</p>
        <p>Microsoft plans to appeal both the sanctions and Judge Jackson's conclusions of law, issued earlier this year. The judge found the company to be a monopoly that repeatedly abused its market power to stifle innovation and competition. The appeals could take a year or more, and the breakup is expected to be stayed pending appeal.</p>
        <p>Under the government proposal, Microsoft would be split into two separate enterprises. One company would take Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating systems, while the other would take everything else, including the Office suite of programs like Word for word processing and Excel for spreadsheet calculations.</p>
        <p>The government maintains that its breakup proposal is, in fact, the least regulatory approach to restore competition in the software industry and prevent Microsoft from engaging in the kinds of antitrust violations the court found.</p>
        <p>The Microsoft filing yesterday came in response to one by the government on Monday in which the government made a few modest wording changes. But the government filing strongly repeated its call for Microsoft to be broken up and to place a series of restrictions on its conduct.</p>
        <p>Microsoft has argued -- as it did again in its filing yesterday -- that the government proposal was ''punitive in concept and effect,'' and would harm the industry and consumers by effectively hobbling the company's ability to freely add new technology to Windows.</p>
        <p>The government asserts that its aim is merely to give consumers and personal computer makers more choice. It says that Microsoft can add whatever it wants to its operating systems -- like speech recognition software in the future, as Microsoft intends to do -- but it must also offer a version of Windows without the new feature.</p>
        <p>Microsoft replies that the effect of that restriction would be to ''Balkanize'' the Windows standard, with many flavors of Windows and thus undermine the technology foundation on which the PC industry has grown and flourished.</p>
