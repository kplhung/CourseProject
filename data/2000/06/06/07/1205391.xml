        <p>Lotus, a three-story supper club and lounge in the meatpacking district, opens tomorrow at 409 West 14th Street.

        <p>Next on the agenda for Jean-Georges Vongerichten will be a restaurant at 66 Leonard Street (Church Street) in a landmark building designed by Henry J. Hardenbergh, the architect of the Plaza Hotel. The concept has not been decided.</p>
