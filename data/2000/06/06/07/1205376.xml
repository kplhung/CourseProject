        <p>THE Web has been a godsend for family trees. Genealogy is one of the Internet's most popular recreations, and a popular genealogy site is www .cyndislist.com. The site has more than 63,000 links, 14 million visitors to the main page and 75,000 page hits a day. It warns people sending e-mail messages (several hundred a day) that Cyndi, of the Web name, does not have time to respond to questions about herself. As a result, some people treat her as an institutional fiction, a Betty Crocker for roots tracers.</p>

        <p>THE Web has been a godsend for family trees. Genealogy is one of the Internet's most popular recreations, and a popular genealogy site is www .cyndislist.com. The site has more than 63,000 links, 14 million visitors to the main page and 75,000 page hits a day. It warns people sending e-mail messages (several hundred a day) that Cyndi, of the Web name, does not have time to respond to questions about herself. As a result, some people treat her as an institutional fiction, a Betty Crocker for roots tracers.</p>
        <p>Cynthia Lynne Howells, 36, may be a minor Web icon, but she is also a real wife and mother whose office is a room over her garage in Puyallup, Wash.</p>
        <p>Ms. Howells first drew her family tree at age 16 as a high school assignment. She decided to go online in 1996, after she told her friends at the Tacoma-Pierce County Genealogical Society about her new computer, and they asked her for a few pages of genealogy Web addresses.</p>
        <p>She describes genealogy as a personal love. ''I'm one of them,'' she said in a telephone interview, referring to her site's visitors.</p>
        <p>Her most common questions are from neophytes who are surprised that they cannot just plug their grandparent's name into a databank and receive a printout listing their ancestors. ''You cannot get everything you need to do online,'' she warned, but her site can get people started. The site's almost uncountable links include Australian convicts and a Civil War genealogy guide.</p>
        <p>The reason for taking up genealogy is often intensely personal, like a parent's dying, she noted. ''It'll get people kind of thinking, 'I've always wanted to know more; I should have asked while she was here.' '' Learning genealogy used to require a good deal of time in a library or a family-history center. By speeding up the learning process and the search for records, she said, ''the Internet has propelled that interest and helped it grow exponentially.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Howells's magazine columns are posted on the site, as are photographs of her 2-year-old son, Evan. ''I still subscribe to the list to let me know when his page is updated,'' a fan wrote recently.</p>
