        <p>Sometimes it is the ringing of a cell phone, sometimes the rapid clicking of a camera shutter. Often the aggrieved player has been Tiger Woods, who always draws the largest following, but other times it has been Ernie Els, Justin Leonard and, most recently, Casey Martin.</p>
        <p>With golf tournaments attracting bigger galleries, disruptive crowd behavior has become a bigger issue on the PGA Tour.</p>
        <p>Thousands of golf fans will travel to Westchester Country Club this week for the Buick Classic, the tour's only stop in the New York metropolitan area. Practice rounds will continue Wednesday, followed by tournament action Thursday through Sunday, giving fans an opportunity to watch a strong field that includes David Duval, Davis Love III, Phil Mickelson, Vijay Singh, Els, Tom Lehman, Sergio Garcia, Fred Couples and Greg Norman.</p>
        <p>Crowds at the Buick Classic have a history of being well-behaved, but golf's popularity is attracting more fans to events, including fans with cellular phones, fans with cameras, fans seeking autographs during play and fans who tend to be more rowdy than those of 20 years ago. Many fans ignore PGA Tour rules, which prohibit cell phones and cameras on the golf course during tournament play. Almost all of today's players have experienced distracting incidents during a round -- cameras clicking during a back swing, a cellular phone ringing during a crucial putt, hoards of fans moving toward the next hole before the entire playing group has finished, or rude comments from hecklers in the gallery.</p>
        <p>As more people come to the course, episodes of fans distracting players have become more frequent. But most players have learned to cope, realizing that golf's growing popularity cannot come without growing pains.</p>
        <p>''When I first came on tour, the kind of small cameras they bring to the golf course weren't even around, and cell phones were scarce because they were very expensive,'' Love, who joined the tour in 1986, said. ''And we didn't used to get big crowds until the weekend. Now we get them for Wednesday practice. I think when John Daly first came on tour we started to get the first bit of rowdy crowds. But the growth of the game is good. We want people to come out.''</p>
        <p>Some would say that golfers protest too much, considering that most professional athletes perform amid the cheering, or booing, of legions of spectators. But golf has always been a game where etiquette has ruled, and players want fans to behave.</p>
        <p>That has not always happened. Already this year, Woods has been forced to step away from his ball several times because of people taking his picture. After a fan's cell phone went off several weeks ago, Leonard walked outside the ropes, approached the fan and read the back of the fan's ticket out loud, including the part that states that cell phones are prohibited. On Sunday at the Kemper Open, Martin became incensed with a fan who heckled him after a missed putt.</p>
        <p>Peter Mele, the Buick Classic tournament director, is optimistic that those kinds of things will not happen this week. Mele is expecting attendance to gradually increase from Wednesday's practice round through Sunday afternoon's final round, particularly if the weekend weather is good. And even more fans would be coming if Woods, the world's No. 1 player, had decided to play, instead of resting before next week's United States Open.</p>
        <p>Mele said the tournament would have 500 to 600 marshals to help players around the course, and to point out any spectators who act inappropriately.</p>
        <p>''Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of fans are respectful, but you get a few fans who had too much to drink, or want to attract attention,'' Mele said. ''Those are the fans you have to watch out for.</p>
        <p>''Times have changed. If you watch the old footage of Arnold Palmer or Jack Nicklaus, people would get close to them and follow them, but they wouldn't invade their space. Now, people don't respect anybody's space. It's kind of a shame. That's why you need all the extra security. If you didn't have security around Tiger, people would maul him, try to rip his shirt off.</p>
        <p>That is a lesson Woods has learned the hard way. Though he is not playing this week, he is the golfer most affected by crowds because he draws the largest galleries. Fans blatantly carry cameras in Woods's gallery, hoping to snap his picture.</p>
        <p>Woods has even been distracted by professional photographers. Last month, playing in Germany, a photographer with a credential inside the ropes took a sequence of shots of Woods as he was teeing off, breaking his concentration.</p>
        <p>''There were photographers taking pictures of me who had never been on a golf course before,'' Woods said recently. ''I went into my back swing and it sounded like rapid fire. I asked this one guy, 'What are you doing?' He said something to me in German. I still don't know what he said.</p>
        <p>''I think more tournaments should be like the Masters at Augusta -- give people claim checks that have cameras and let them get it back after the round,'' Woods said. ''That would cut down on pictures. They also need to cut back on alcohol sales. Especially when it's hot, things can get out of hand. Fans get unruly. It has happened at Phoenix. A lot of players aren't going back to Phoenix because fans are so rowdy on the 16th hole.''</p>
        <p>Woods said he often marks his ball before taking short putts so he can be the last player in his group to finish. When Woods finishes a hole, many spectators run to the next hole, disturbing the other players in his group who have not finished.</p>
        <p>Love said fans at the Buick Classic have contributed to the tournament's popularity, and he was looking forward to the tournament.</p>
        <p>''New York crowds have a reputation for being rowdy, but in golf, Phoenix and Dallas crowds are far more rowdy,'' Love said. ''Every once in a while you get someone who's too loud, but these are great golf fans up here. It's a great golf area, and they know the game.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>As of Tuesday, 10 players had withdrawn from the Buick Classic since the original commitment list, including PAUL AZINGER, MARK CALCAVECCHIA and PAUL LAWRIE. . . . SHIGEKI MARUYAMA, who shot a record round of 58 during Monday's qualifying for the United States Open in Rockville, Md., said his telephone had been ringing off the hook. ''Hello, hello, hello, all night,'' said Maruyama, who will play in the Buick Classic.</p>
