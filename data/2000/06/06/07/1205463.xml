        <p>When President Clinton greeted the staff of the American Embassy in Lisbon last Thursday evening, he confessed that he had fallen in love with fado, the melancholic Portuguese music with words that yearn for a past that never was and may never be again.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to promote fado music all over the world!'' Mr. Clinton exclaimed, adding, ''I think fado now has become my major passion in life.''</p>

        <p>When President Clinton greeted the staff of the American Embassy in Lisbon last Thursday evening, he confessed that he had fallen in love with fado, the melancholic Portuguese music with words that yearn for a past that never was and may never be again.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to promote fado music all over the world!'' Mr. Clinton exclaimed, adding, ''I think fado now has become my major passion in life.''</p>
        <p>Like the music he has warmly embraced, Mr. Clinton's eight-day trip to Europe was filled with a sense of a what was and what might have been.</p>
        <p>He has nearly eight months left in his presidency, but the trip had a decidedly nostalgic air, as if much unfinished business will be left that way and as if parts of his presidency were already over.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has begun to talk in the past tense. ''I thought it was important for me to travel the world and for us to try to make a better future out of the post-Communist, post-cold-war world,'' he told the embassy staff. ''So I've had the opportunity to see many things.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, when Ronald Reagan was at the same point of his presidency, he took a different tack. Asked at his last economic summit meeting in June 1988 whether he had received a ''farewell hug'' at his final meeting with his colleagues, Mr. Reagan replied, ''I'm not saying farewell. I'm going to lunch.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton went out of his way to visit two ''formers'' with whom he had close relations: former Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and former President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. Even more telling, he has begun to have fun.</p>
        <p>''Something is happening,'' he said. ''As I move toward the end of my term, my staff has relaxed its requirement that I actually suffer a physical breakdown on every trip from work. I actually got time to play golf.'' (Five hours of it, to be precise.)</p>
        <p>But he drew the line one evening after dinner with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder at an Alsatian restaurant in East Berlin.</p>
        <p>''I am holding one of Fidel's cigars in my hand that I would like to give to you,'' Mr. Schroder said naughtily, handing Mr. Clinton a Cuban cigar. Mr. Clinton politely declined.</p>
        <p>Every Party Has a Pooper</p>
        <p>In Moscow, Mr. Clinton succeeded in getting President Vladimir V. Putin, a former K.G.B. colonel, to open up -- but only ever so slightly. After the working dinner at the Russian president's residence on the first evening, Mr. Clinton asked to see the Russian equivalent of the Oval Office. The office was too far away, so Mr. Putin showed Mr. Clinton his private study, his exercise room (complete with a massage table) and his small chapel.</p>
        <p>As for gifts, Mr. Putin gave Mr. Clinton an antique silver samovar, and Mr. Putin got a millennium medallion from Tiffany's and a Smithsonian book on aviation.</p>
        <p>During their intense series of talks, Mr. Putin was determined not to let Mr. Clinton dominate the conversation and spoke more than Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin also went on the offensive. When Mr. Clinton raised the structural reforms Russia needed to make to attract investment, for example, Mr. Putin said that his side had some demands too, raising much smaller issues like the need to amend a bilateral investment treaty.</p>
        <p>''A very serious interlocutor,'' is how Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright described him in a phone conversation from Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>A fourth administration official said that the talks were so serious, blunt and humorless that Mr. Clinton felt compelled to carry that mood forward in his news conference.</p>
        <p>''The president is a naturally warm guy,'' said the official. ''There were no warm feelings to project.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin is so serious that when a jazz combo of pre-teenagers played during a performance in Mr. Clinton's honor, a delighted Mr. Clinton moved to the music; Mr. Putin sat ramrod straight in his chair.</p>
        <p>Pointed Fashion Statement</p>
        <p>There is much talk in Washington these days that the State Department has ceded control of a number of foreign policy issues to Samuel R. Berger, the president's national security adviser.</p>
        <p>But the summit in Moscow illustrated that, when it comes to Russia, the State Department is in command. For the first two working meetings between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Putin each president brought along only one aide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin brought Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to the working dinner on Saturday evening and Sergey Prikhodko, Mr. Putin's chief foreign policy adviser, to the first meeting on Sunday. Mr. Clinton brought Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, a Russia expert and Mr. Clinton's housemate from his Oxford days, to both. As has happened in the past, Mr. Berger and Dr. Albright and other senior officials were not invited.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Albright used a fashion statement to make her own policy point with the Russians. As Mr. Putin shook Dr. Albright's hand before a meeting on Sunday, Mr. Clinton tried to explain the meaning of the three brown pins depicting monkeys on the lapel of her jacket. They represent, ''see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''That's Madeleine's entire foreign policy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin replied, ''I always see what kind of a brooch she's wearing.'' Dr. Albright often uses her jewelry to reflect her policy priorities.</p>
        <p>But it is unclear whether the Russians got her real message, and Dr. Albright said that she wore the pins not to characterize American foreign policy but Russia's prosecution of the war in Chechnya. ''I've been telling the Russians since it started that they have been in denial about what is going on in Chechnya, that they need to solve this politically, not militarily,'' Dr. Albright said in the telephone conversation. ''They're not seeing what is going on. I wore those pins because it is the epitome of the way they are in denial.''</p>
        <p>A White House official called Mr. Clinton's remark about the pin ''a joke.''</p>
