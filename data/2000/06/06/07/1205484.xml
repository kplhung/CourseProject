        <p>Stephanie King's 5-year-old twins are no longer allowed to play outside at dusk in their neighborhood in Brewster, N.Y. Patricia Ahlqvist stretches mosquito netting over her 3-month-old's carriage each time she leaves her home in Tarrytown, N.Y., no matter the hour, and she forced her 4-year-old daughter's kiddie pool into early retirement.</p>
        <p>Deborah Damascus had the trampoline dismantled in her yard in Pound Ridge, N.Y., after noticing a swarm of mosquitoes hovering over it. And in New Rochelle, N.Y., where a woman died last summer from the West Nile encephalitis virus, Karen Wunsch recently put her stone birdbath into storage for the summer.</p>
        <p>In suburban areas across New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, where big yards are filled with potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes, residents are bracing for another summer of West Nile jitters. In particular, families with young children are scanning their properties for breeding sites the way sentries once were on the lookout for U-boats.</p>
        <p>''I'm probably a hypochondriac, but I respect the outdoors because we live in a rural area,'' said Mrs. Damascus, a mother of three whose two-acre property is laced with marsh. ''We just have to be cautious until we see whether it comes back. Mothers always worry.''</p>
        <p>Many residents seem to be taking the threat in stride, aware of the incredibly long odds of contracting the illness. Of the millions of residents in the area where the virus was found last summer -- primarily New York City, Westchester County and Nassau County -- seven people died and 62 suffered brain infections. So far, researchers have reported finding the virus in a sample of dormant adult mosquitoes in Queens and in a red-tailed hawk that died in Westchester County in February. But no cases in humans have been reported.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to tell my kids they can't play outside,'' said Emily Haft Bloom of Chappaqua, N.Y., whose children are 5 and 7. ''It's ridiculous. This is not like smallpox.''</p>
        <p>But many others are worried and are taking action now. They are altering their habits in ways large and small to protect against Culex pipiens, the common house mosquito that breeds in standing water and carries the West Nile virus from birds to people.</p>
        <p>In some cases, residents are going further than government officials have suggested. Some are discarding  birdbaths instead of just changing the water frequently, and others are putting up screens on porches, ridding yards of cans and other possible places for breeding and changing their leisure habits, albeit grudgingly.</p>
        <p>''It's very scary to me,'' said Mrs. Ahlqvist, who is especially worried about her infant son, who is too young to have insect repellent on his skin.  ''If you have people over and you're having a barbecue, everybody has to go into the house. It really destroys everything.''</p>
        <p>There are other precautions.</p>
        <p>Deede Pecora of New Milford, Conn., has installed ''a hummingbird misting hose,'' which sprays a fine mist from a narrow tube into her birdbath. The mist performs triple duty, she said; it attracts hummingbirds, waters the perennial garden around the birdbath, and stirs the water so mosquito larvae cannot survive.</p>
        <p>Bette Emmons, also of New Milford, said she was so concerned about the West Nile virus that she had canceled plans to compete in several horse shows in New Jersey this summer. ''There's no way I'm taking my Lipizzan stallion there.'' she said. ''He's way too valuable.''</p>
        <p>Michelle Basmajian of Medford, in Burlington County, N.J., said she was very anxious about protecting her daughter, Amanda, 6, although New Jersey did not have any human cases of infection with the West Nile virus last year.</p>
        <p>''This is the very first year ever that we have our swimming pool completely covered, and it's because of that scare last year,'' Ms. Basmajian said. ''I've noticed more bites this season so far, and every time my child gets bitten I'm ready to call the doctor. I'm watching her like a hawk because who's to say which bite will be the one to put a child in the hospital. It's very scary.''</p>
        <p>Officials in Westchester County recently mailed out oversized postcards to all residents about the West Nile virus. The mailing tried to allay fears about the spraying of pesticides, which seemed to arouse more worry last summer than the mosquitoes and the virus themselves. The county's mosquito-control program, the postcards said, is ''designed to track and control mosquitoes at an early stage to try and avoid broad-based aerial spraying.''</p>
        <p>Westchester has dropped larvicide into 50,000 catch basins, and health officials have urged residents to take preventive measures, like draining clogged gutters, turning over unused wheelbarrows, changing the water in birdbaths frequently and keeping window screens in good repair.</p>
        <p>The official start of summer is still two weeks away, and the 40 or so species of mosquitoes in New York have yet to reproduce in large numbers. But concern about West Nile virus has already caused a run on some products.</p>
        <p>In Yonkers, Central Shade and Glass is scrambling to keep up with orders for new screens. ''This year the screening season started in February, whereas normally we start in early May,'' said Ted Politis, the owner. ''We've been extremely busy. People are concerned, and they're taking precautions.''</p>
        <p>At Smith &amp; Hawken, a garden tools and outdoor furniture store in Scarsdale, a product that kills mosquito larvae, Mosquito Dunks, is selling very well. The larvicide, which comes in donut-shaped tablets in packs of six and sells for $12, are effective against larvae for 30 days in bird baths, tree holes, roof gutters, flower pots, old tires and unused swimming pool, according to the label.</p>
        <p>''We're ordering them every day,'' said Ryan Cunningham, a sales clerk. ''People are coming in and buying five or six at a time.''</p>
        <p>Parents of young children, who, along with the elderly, are particularly vulnerable to the virus, are not the only ones who are nervous. Karen Wunsch, 56, an associate professor of English at Queensborough Community College whose children are now grown, decided to get rid of her birdbath entirely.</p>
        <p>''You get lazy and you forget to change the water,'' she said, adding that she would miss watching the sparrows from her screened porch over a morning cup of coffee.</p>
        <p>In Brewster, a village in Putnam County north of Westchester, parents in the Fieldstone Pond townhouse complex have agreed to bring their children indoors each evening before the mosquitoes come out in force, rolling their curfew back to 7 p.m. from 8. ''They hate it,'' said Miss King, a 35-year-old accountant, of her 5-year-old twins, Danielle and Robert. ''But the other neighbors started doing it, too. If you make a pact, it's not as bad.''</p>
        <p>But some parents are still more anxious about the aerial spraying than the problem it is intended to cure. ''You're more likely to get sick over a longer period of time from the insecticide they spray nonchalantly than from the mosquitoes,'' said Lisa Minton, a speech pathologist in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., who has a 4-month-old baby and 4-year-old twins. ''Then you have to pull toys inside and wash things. That's a huge nuisance.''</p>
