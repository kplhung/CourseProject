        <p>The humiliated Suffolk County sheriff surrendered this morning in criminal court on a host of political corruption and abuse-of-power charges, including allegations that he and a former undersheriff pressured employees at the county jail into making campaign contributions in exchange for plum assignments.</p>
        <p>The sheriff, Patrick A. Mahoney, pleaded not guilty to all the counts handed up by a grand jury that investigated his office for 15 months: one felony count of defrauding the government and 54 misdemeanors charging that over the course of his 11-year tenure as sheriff, he raffled off special deputy sheriff positions to the highest bidder. He was also accused of using a full-time county employee to coordinate his re-election efforts; that he used county offices and vehicles for personal business and that he bilked the Sheriff's Benevolent Fund of $16,000.</p>
        <p>His former undersheriff, Edward J. Morris, was charged with 28 felony counts and 7 misdemeanors, the most serious charge being bribery. He is accused of coercing correction officers under his command into making campaign donations to the sheriff in exchange for overtime work. According to the grand jury indictment unsealed this morning in Suffolk County Court, Mr. Morris solicited and accepted more than $10,000 from correction officers over the last 10 years on Sheriff Mahoney's behalf. Mr. Morris, too, pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>
        <p>The arraignment came as no surprise; Sheriff Mahoney said last week that he expected to be indicted. But he received no special privileges this morning from District Attorney James M. Catterson Jr. The sheriff was made to walk through the front entrance of the courthouse at 9:30 A.M. Ashen-faced, staring straight ahead, he was escorted upstairs, where he was fingerprinted and photographed. He then had to navigate a gantlet of news media. ''This whole thing has the odor of garbage that it is,'' he said. ''Catterson's gone too far.''</p>
        <p>Assistant District Attorney Christopher A. McPartland, who is prosecuting the case, gave a wry smile as the sheriff walked past him and into the courtroom.</p>
        <p>The sheriff says the indictments are the culmination of a long-running feud between him and Mr. Catterson, Suffolk County's two most powerful elected law enforcement officials. It is a battle between a Republican district attorney who is not shy about using his prosecutorial powers and an independent, hard-charging Republican sheriff who bucked the party last year and crossed over to the Democrats to run against the Republican county executive.</p>
        <p>About 15 months ago the district attorney empaneled a grand jury to investigate allegations of corruption in the sheriff's office. Their feud goes back at least to 1993, when Mr. Catterson felt that the sheriff had upstaged him after Katie Beers, a 10-year-old who was kidnapped and held in a dungeon for 16 days, was found alive. There was a time before that when Mr. Mahoney had endorsed Mr. Catterson for district attorney. Now their relationship has degenerated so badly that Republicans routinely argue over who has the unsavory task of standing between the two men during photo opportunities.</p>
        <p>''The system works when honest people work the system,'' Sheriff Mahoney said after his arraignment. ''When dishonest people like the D.A. use the system to indict his political enemies, the system fails. Catterson is the biggest bully in Suffolk County.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Catterson brushed off those remarks as the ramblings of a desperate man. ''I understand he's under a lot of pressure,'' Mr. Catterson said at his Hauppauge office. ''He's been saying these things for years. This so-called feud is in his mind. This had nothing to do with personality but everything to do with misconduct.''</p>
