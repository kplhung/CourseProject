        <p>Moving from computer screens to television sets, the At Home Corporation will cooperate with Cox Communications in a test of interactive television services in San Diego.</p>
        <p>At Home, which is controlled by the AT&amp;T Corporation, is the nation's leading provider of cable modem service, which delivers high-speed Internet access using cable television lines. Cox is one of the biggest cable television providers.</p>
        <p>Cable operators of all sizes have spent billions of dollars in recent years to upgrade their systems to give computer users high-speed access to cyberspace, but many United States households do not have computers at all.</p>
        <p>In their San Diego trial, At Home and Cox intend to deliver interactive services, like news, weather, and on-demand stock quotes, as well as e-mail and shopping. One person close to the test, which will be formally announced today, said the effort, which could begin as soon as next month, will cover only a few thousand homes.</p>
