        <p>G. Richard Wagoner Jr., who became the youngest chief executive of General Motors last Thursday, said at the company's annual meeting here today that he planned to maintain the current business strategies and he expected that new truck models and an emphasis on Internet marketing would lift the G.M. market share.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagoner, 47, said that having helped develop the current strategy over the last year and a half as G.M.'s president, he did not see an immediate need to change it. ''It gives us a great chance to build off what we're doing,'' he said at a news conference after the meeting.</p>

        <p>G. Richard Wagoner Jr., who became the youngest chief executive of General Motors last Thursday, said at the company's annual meeting here today that he planned to maintain the current business strategies and he expected that new truck models and an emphasis on Internet marketing would lift the G.M. market share.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagoner, 47, said that having helped develop the current strategy over the last year and a half as G.M.'s president, he did not see an immediate need to change it. ''It gives us a great chance to build off what we're doing,'' he said at a news conference after the meeting.</p>
        <p>Asked if he had a vision of the future for the world's largest automaker, Mr. Wagoner responded by mentioning overseas expansion, one theme of his predecessor as chief executive, John F. Smith Jr., who remains G.M.'s chairman. ''As far as vision for the company, if we want to maintain the position that we have, or grow it, we need a stronger sales footprint, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region,'' Mr. Wagoner said.</p>
        <p>G.M.'s market share in the United States, currently 28 percent, has been slowly falling since the 1960's, an erosion that no team of G.M. executives has been able to halt. But the company has had somewhat more success overseas, partly by buying minority stakes in companies like Isuzu, Suzuki and, most recently, Fiat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagoner said that new models would help G.M.'s market share in the United States, although he declined to provide a target or timetable. Long criticized for producing bland cars, G.M. plans to introduce riskier designs later this year, like the Pontiac Aztek, a vehicle that combines characteristics of a small car and a small sport utility vehicle. G.M. is also making it easier for customers to use the Internet to find a dealership with a specific model equipped with a particular combination of options.</p>
        <p>G.M. officials who insisted on anonymity recently predicted that Mr. Wagoner would make some executive changes this summer but would keep to G.M.'s tradition of incremental change, although at a somewhat quicker pace than Mr. Smith.</p>
        <p>The Ford Motor Company held its annual meeting three weeks ago at the Atlanta Zoo, and used the occasion to emphasize its commitment to social responsibility, particularly environmental and safety issues. G.M. executives addressed broad societal concerns in response to shareholders' questions, and said that they were also resolved to improve the environment.</p>
        <p>Harry J. Pearce, G.M.'s vice chairman, expressed in the strongest terms yet his conviction that gasoline-powered engines in cars would someday be replaced by fuel cells, which rely on chemical reactions to produce power.</p>
        <p>''It's not a question of if, it's a question of when, but it may be many years off,'' Mr. Pearce said during the annual meeting. He was even more cautious about the timing in a brief conversation after the meeting, saying, ''I think it's impossible to put a time frame on it, but I'm satisfied the day will come.''</p>
        <p>Fuel cells produce virtually no pollution, but are expensive and bulky to manufacture. G.M. actually assembled a prototype fuel-cell car in the 1960's, and has been working ever since on the technology, but has put much more emphasis on the research as it and other automakers have begun making progress.</p>
        <p>John Herlitz, DaimlerChrysler's vice president of vehicle design, said at a news conference on design issues on Monday in Dearborn, Mich., that at least 10 more years of work were needed before fuel cells could be put in mass-production vehicles.</p>
        <p>Jesse Jackson, the leader of the Rainbow/Push coalition and a former presidential candidate, also spoke at the annual meeting, calling on G.M. to continue its efforts to find more car dealers who are members of ethnic minorities, and to open more dealerships in minority neighborhoods.</p>
