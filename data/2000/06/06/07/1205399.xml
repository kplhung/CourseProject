        <p>WHAT a difference a decade makes. Today, albarinos are known as stylish and popular white wines that are crisp, refreshing and delicious with a wide range of foods. Ten years ago, they were practically unheard of outside Spain and Portugal.</p>
        <p>The change began in 1988, when the Spanish government officially recognized the Rias Baixas (pronounced REE-yas BUY-shas) wine region, three small pieces of land in southwestern Galicia just north of Portugal.

        <p>WHAT a difference a decade makes. Today, albarinos are known as stylish and popular white wines that are crisp, refreshing and delicious with a wide range of foods. Ten years ago, they were practically unheard of outside Spain and Portugal.</p>
        <p>The change began in 1988, when the Spanish government officially recognized the Rias Baixas (pronounced REE-yas BUY-shas) wine region, three small pieces of land in southwestern Galicia just north of Portugal. This is the home of the albarino grape in Spain, and with recognition came rapid growth in the number of wineries producing albarino and in the quality of the viticulture and winemaking.</p>
        <p>As quality improved, so did demand. In 1998, Spain shipped approximately 22,000 cases of albarino to the United States, up from  2,343 cases in 1992, according to  Wines From Spain, a promotional agency.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, dozens of albarinos are available in New York, although they are not always top quality. The best are highly aromatic, with a bouquet that can range from lemon-lime to cantaloupe, apricot and vanilla. Poor examples tend to be thin and harshly acidic.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because it is produced near the sea, albarino is a natural partner for seafood, but it also goes well with chicken, vegetables and light pasta and veal. Although albarino is often said to be a good aperitif, I find it improves immeasurably with food, which softens the wine's naturally high acidity and brings out nuances.</p>
        <p>In its youth, the wine is fresh and lively, and though I'm told that albarino ages well, I've never had a bottle more than a couple of years old.</p>
        <p>You can still find 1998's on the shelves, but these six are all 1999's.</p>
