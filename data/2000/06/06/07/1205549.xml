        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>What a shame that health maintenance organizations are ''forced'' to get out of Medicare because they can't turn a substantial profit with the regulations imposed on them by the government (front page, June 3). That only proves that the only way they can stay in business is by making their own rules and imposing hardships on patients and providers.</p>

        <p>Managed care was an answer to a nonexistent problem. Medicare was doing fine on its own, so the insurers decided that it was time to get a piece of the action. Too bad we can't legislate some rules and regulations that they would have to abide by in the rest of health care not covered by Medicare.</p>
