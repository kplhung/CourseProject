        <p>It wasn't just the money. It was also the machine.</p>
        <p>Jon S. Corzine's record-breaking spending spree on his way to the Democratic Senate nomination in today's New Jersey primary made most of the news during his long and venomous campaign against former Gov. Jim Florio, just as the advertising it paid for helped turn him from a nobody into a household name across the state in only a few months.</p>
        <p>But on election day, the backing Mr. Corzine's millions cultivated among leaders of New Jersey Democratic Party establishment also produced the turnout in key election districts that finally sank Mr. Florio's dogged struggle for a comeback.</p>
        <p>In the populous urban counties of Bergen, Essex and Union, Democratic county leaders spent lavishly on Mr. Corzine's get-out-the-vote effort to bus voters to the polls, handing him top-heavy margins of victories that swamped Mr. Florio's strong leads in his southern base of Camden, Atlantic and Cumberland Counties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio can complain that Mr. Corzine's $35 million in spending bought the friends he needed on election day, and Mr. Corzine's friends in the party can reply that he was only practicing the kind of deep-pocket ''party building'' that prosperous Republicans have been doing for years. The fact is that in tending to the party and not just to the politics of the campaign, Mr. Corzine avoided the mistake of other rich men who thought, as rich men often seem to do, that their money unaided by others was all they needed to get what they wanted.</p>
        <p>''How many examples can you call up?'' said Stephen A. Salmore, a Republican campaign consultant. ''Ron Lauder, Al Checchi, Huffington, Mark Dayton in Minnesota -- the number of wealthy candidates who have spent their money and gone down in flames is as great if not greater than the ones who have spent their money and won.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Checchi and Michael Huffington lost in Republican races in California, after spending huge fortunes for elusive votes. Mr. Lauder, the cosmetics heir, scorned the New York City Republican Party when he ran for mayor in 1989 and was gleefully crushed by them. Mr. Dayton, a department store heir, ran third in his race for governor in Minnesota two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine had the support of virtually every important Democrat in the state and outside it, including the chairman of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee,  Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey; Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, who is retiring and whose seat Mr. Corzine is seeking;  and a roster of county Democratic chairmen and committee members.</p>
        <p>These Democratic leaders were not, as Mr. Florio charged, interested only in Mr. Corzine's money, which allowed them to save a bundle for next year's governor's race, the grand prize in New Jersey politics. They were also deeply averse to hitching their party's wagon to Mr. Florio's dubious star, which has sputtered more than it has sparkled in two defeats for governor and one victory. Most recently, Mr. Florio was evicted from the State House by Christine Todd Whitman in 1993 after forcing a $2.8 billion tax increase through the Legislature, a tax increase that still resonates in the state, including in Mr. Corzine's attack ads.</p>
        <p>This year, as Robert C. Janiszewski, the Hudson County executive, put it on Sunday, the Democrats were not interested in spending the fall campaign ''defending Jim Florio's tax increases.''</p>
        <p>Although he lost, Mr. Florio still made a strong showing in his South Jersey stronghold, and among thousands of Democrats around the state.</p>
        <p>''He's the emotional favorite of the rank and file Democrats,'' said Roger A. Bodman, a prominent Trenton lobbyist who was a member of Gov. Thomas H. Kean's Republican administration. ''It goes beyond his tax increase to 25 years as an assemblyman and a congressman and as governor, and as a guy who stood up for the party year in and year out.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Florio could not get the traction he needed by making Mr. Corzine's money and his Wall Street career the issue. He accused Mr. Corzine of buying the nomination, he accused the party leaders who abandoned him for selling out, and he linked Mr. Corzine's career as the head of Goldman Sachs, the investment house, to a range of evils, including profiting from slavery in Sudan.</p>
        <p>Now the state is poised for an unusual match.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Bodman put it: ''You can have this curious situation where the Republican candidate is the middle-class everyday Joe with a mortgage and a six-year-old car against the Democrat who is a millionaire and who out of noblesse oblige decides to go out and give something back to society.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine may wake up on Wednesday hoping that his victory has at last put to rest Mr. Florio's charge that the $35 million he spent on his campaign represented a poisonous level of spending. After all, he could maintain, the voters have absolved him.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Salmore maintained that the Republicans could easily build on the record of ill will toward Mr. Corzine's millions built up by Mr. Florio's relentless attacks, and add to it a favorite Republican theme, that Democrats cannot be trusted with money.</p>
        <p>''This is how you say it,'' Mr. Salmore said. '' 'Look how much money he spent on his campaign, and now guess how much of your money he is going to spend if he goes to Washington. This man doesn't know the value of a dollar -- how can you trust him with your taxes?' ''</p>
        <p>Robert G. Sommer, a Democratic lobbyist and once a member of Mr. Florio's Congressional staff, said that Mr. Corzine would not necessarily allow the Republicans to spring their syllogism that big campaign spending necessarily equals big tax dollar spending.</p>
        <p>''In the end of this campaign, the money issues certainly came to the fore,'' Mr. Sommer said today. ''But now it's five months to Election Day, and Jon Corzine can make it a question about him and his character. He is a man of character, he's worked harder than his opponent in this race, and now he's the home team.''</p>
