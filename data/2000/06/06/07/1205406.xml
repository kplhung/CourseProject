        <p>In Celebration</p>
        <p>She plays the piano. She sings. She composes. She is a professor emeritus at Bronx Community college. She is the jazz artist Valerie Capers, who will perform with her quintet at 8 tonight at Weill Recital Hall. The program, ''Encores Plus,'' consists of Broadway and pop standards and features a salute to Hoagy Carmichael in his centennial year.</p>
        <p>Keys to Music</p>
        <p>If the answer is Bartolomeo Cristofori, what is the question? The question is: Who invented the piano? By 1700, Cristofori (1655-1731), an Italian keyboard instrument maker and designer associated with the Florentine court, is known to have created at least one keyboard instrument using the hammer method of striking the strings. To commemorate the 300th anniversary of his invention, Leonard Slatkin, the National Symphony Orchestra and guests will celebrate the piano with six concerts in five days. Beginning at 7:30 tonight  at the Kennedy Center in Washington, pianists like William Bolcom, Sarah Davis Buechner, Joseph Kalichstein, Lambert Orkis, Peter Shickele and Sara Wolfensohn will play works for two and more hands, for multiple keyboards, for 12 pianos and for toy piano, as well as double and triple concertos and more.</p>
