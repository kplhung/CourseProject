        <p>Some speakers hailed New Jersey's black bears as majestic symbols of the state's diminishing wilderness and appealed for their preservation. Others denounced them as risks to children and called for their elimination.</p>
        <p>Some called them timid, harmless  and quick to flee. But others said they were becoming more and more ominous and threatening.</p>
        <p>Opinions ran the gamut tonight as about 450 people, many heavily opinionated, turned out for a public hearing on the New Jersey Fish and Game Council's plan to allow bear hunting in the state for the first time in 30 years. Once nearly extinct, New Jersey's black bear population is flourishing and is estimated at 1,000. The council has proposed killing 350 of them this year, and up to 320 more by 2003. It is to make its final decision on June 22.</p>
        <p>The plan was hailed tonight by representatives of sportsmen's clubs and hunters' groups, and condemned by environmentalists and animal rights activists.</p>
        <p>A social worker from Flemington, Gloria Zola-Mulloy, said hunting posed a greater public risk than the bears and sent children the message that violence was a viable solution.</p>
        <p>''Problems should be solved through knowledge, science and education,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Another foe of the proposed hunt, Jack DeTalvo, the superintendent of schools in Middletown and a member of the National Rifle Association, said he saw no need for a hunting season and urged the council to allow hunting only by people who need to protect themselves or their property.</p>
        <p>''I don't think anyone's tripping over bears yet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Dennis Ohab, a turkey hunter from Jefferson Township, disagreed.</p>
        <p>''It's hand-to-hand combat up there,'' he said of his hometown, recalling that a bear followed him home from a recent hunt. ''I was screaming and hollering and the bear kept coming. Sooner or later our children will get killed.''</p>
        <p>The measure has become the most controversial proposed change to state hunting regulations in years.</p>
        <p>Twenty-two animal rights groups have formed an antihunt coalition and staged rallies. Coalition leaders contend that the Fish and Game Council has overestimated the bear population and has proposed the hunt to reverse declining sales of hunting licenses. They favor sterilization of female bears and programs to teach  people ways to coexist with bears, which by nature are shy and solitary.</p>
        <p>Council officials counter that sterilization would be too limited and costly for a bear population that is expanding from traditional terrain in the deep forests of Sussex, Morris and Passaic Counties to wooded suburban towns in Bergen, Somerset and Essex Counties. They say their estimate of 1,000 bears is a sound projection based on of trapping and tagging programs and studies of birthrates and survival rates.</p>
        <p>Last year, the number of towns reporting bear sightings and damage increased to 111 from 48 in 1995, the council has said. Of the 1,659 bear complaints it received in 1999, 29 involved bears breaking into homes, up from 3 in 1995, and 28 involved bears rummaging around campgrounds and parks, up from 5.</p>
        <p>The council chairman, John W. Bradway, said recently that safety was the primary reason for the proposed hunt.</p>
        <p>Ann Ingraham, who lives in Fredon, in the forests of Sussex County, thinks the state is overstating things. She said bears have meandered peacefully through her yard for many years. ''You get to know them by the way they walk and their ear tags,'' she said. ''Bear No. 15 lies behind my fence while I'm working in the garden.''</p>
