        <p>TUESDAY broke rough and forbidding. The gray, hard rain made it a Primary Day for only the most committed -- a Jim Florio kind of day. His was never the politics of sunny promises and pleasantries, and some political forecasters even imagined that bad skies were good news for the defeated governor's attempted comeback. After 16 campaigns in 31 years, Florio loyalists had weathered much worse.</p>
        <p>''We will go forth today as crusaders,'' Mr. Florio told a room jammed with supporters at his headquarters here yesterday morning. ''Crusaders always defeat mercenaries.''</p>

        <p>TUESDAY broke rough and forbidding. The gray, hard rain made it a Primary Day for only the most committed -- a Jim Florio kind of day. His was never the politics of sunny promises and pleasantries, and some political forecasters even imagined that bad skies were good news for the defeated governor's attempted comeback. After 16 campaigns in 31 years, Florio loyalists had weathered much worse.</p>
        <p>''We will go forth today as crusaders,'' Mr. Florio told a room jammed with supporters at his headquarters here yesterday morning. ''Crusaders always defeat mercenaries.''</p>
        <p>In a candidacy many expected might be his last, Mr. Florio had found his perfect image and perfect enemy. His sometimes cutting tone could make a statement sound like an argument, a campaign sound like a cause. And as the son of a boatyard worker from Red Hook, Brooklyn, who viewed himself as the champion of working people, Mr. Florio saw the $35 million of personal money Jon S. Corzine spent in the Democratic primary for the United States Senate as a demon he needed to slay.</p>
        <p>''He had to confront his worst nightmare,'' said James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''He's running for Senate against maybe the one guy in America who would spend 30 or 40 million dollars.''</p>
        <p>That guy won, at least in part because Mr. Florio was still stained by the $2.8 billion in taxes he raised as governor a decade ago. But last night, mounting a stage to  hearty cheers from supporters who have been with him for a generation, Mr. Florio had already found a way to look beyond his defeat.</p>
        <p>''I think this campaign will stand as a lasting monument to the need to have real campaign finance reform,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio has long been New Jersey's all-terrain politician, grinding away on thick treads at the seemingly insurmountable.</p>
        <p>He led a revolt in the late 1970's against the powerful and scandal-tainted Camden Democratic machine that had originally put him in office. He won his party's support for governor three times, a considerable feat for a candidate from the less-populated southern half of the state. And, despite his sour image as governor, he came within one percentage point of winning re-election.</p>
        <p>During the day yesterday, those closest to Mr. Florio wouldn't mention the possibility of losing. But Chris Florio, Mr. Florio's 38-year-old son, remembered the 1993 defeat. ''It was a tough night,'' he said. ''My father was the only one in the room who wasn't crushed.''</p>
        <p>DENTED, a bit, but he drove on. ''My whole approach to this is you get to a point, you turn the page and you go to the next chapter,'' Mr. Florio said yesterday afternoon. ''I don't see elections as a test of self-esteem. A certain number of people, at that specific time, either do or don't think you're the one for the job. It's not whether I'm a good person or a bad person.''</p>
        <p>On stage last night, he said his mother, who died recently, had given him the values that drove his career. He said she taught him that whatever course he chose, he should ''be the best I can be.''</p>
        <p>Now, at age 62, with a career in the State Assembly, the Congress and the State House, Mr. Florio is again facing the question of what he will be. He has taught college and practiced law since his defeat in 1993.</p>
        <p>But he was itchy to return to public life. ''I think he likes the give and take,'' said Tom Kean, another former governor. ''I think he likes the hard issues. I think, and I don't mean to be critical, he likes the power. He likes to have influence.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, as skies in South Jersey were clearing and the votes to defeat him were gathering, Mr. Florio said he was ready to let the fight of this campaign pass. ''I see politics as the dues you pay to formulate public policy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It was hard for supporters not to wonder how much longer Mr. Florio could afford the dues. ''This is it,'' said Barbara Pine, who had worked numerous Florio campaigns. ''This is the ball game. I don't think he could run again if he doesn't win.''</p>
        <p>But those who have opposed him know better. ''People have counted him out a lot over the years,'' said Mr. Kean, who defeated Mr. Florio in the 1981 gubernatorial race by a mere 1,797 votes, ''and they've been wrong.''</p>
