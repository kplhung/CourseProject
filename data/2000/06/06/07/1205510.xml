        <p>No ordinary mother, Rosie O'Donnell.</p>
        <p>''I'm very fortunate that I am very, very rich,'' said Ms. O'Donnell, the television personality who has adopted three children. She can manage, she says, ''because I'm a multimillionaire. I do it just about trouble-free.''</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. O'Donnell says she had a crummy childhood, and she vowed to herself that if she was ever to ''get famous, like Barbra Streisand,'' she would dedicate herself to child advocacy, which is what she did yesterday with Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper.</p>
        <p>They spoke in a rather unusual child care center, the Children's All Day School on East 60th Street in Manhattan, a jolly little place where tuition for children up to 3 years old runs $15,200 a year.</p>
        <p>Only about 10 percent of the 85 children at this center receive scholarship assistance. And Ms. O'Donnell is hardly typical of most parents. But Mr. Gore used both today to promote his ''family agenda,'' proposing tax cuts and grants to help make child care better and more affordable.</p>
        <p>Day care has become one of the most pressing issues -- and serious expenses -- for young families. One hundred years ago, Mr. Gore said, only 2 of 10 mothers worked outside the home; today nearly 8 in 10 do, and nearly 13 million American children spend at least part of their days being cared for by someone other than their parents.</p>
        <p>Scrunched into the corner of a playroom, Mr. Gore, flanked by Ms. O'Donnell and Mrs. Gore, announced  steps he would take as president, a $38 billion package over 10 years.</p>
        <p>He said that only 14 percent of the nation's day care centers are considered to be of high quality and he would establish a fund to help states improve the health and safety of child care centers. He would require background checks on workers and require a minimum level of training.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also said he would provide $500 in tax relief for parents who stay at home with infants. He would allow such parents with children under the age of 1 to claim $500 in expenses. He also said he would expand the Family and Medical Leave Act to businesses with fewer than 25 employees.</p>
        <p>He said he would make the existing child care tax credit refundable. Now, a family of four with an income of less than $25,000 cannot claim tax credit for child care costs because they pay no tax. Mr. Gore said that by making the child care tax credit refundable, such families could receive up to $2,400.</p>
        <p>He also said he would increase the amount of child care expenses that families could write off. Now, families can claim 30 percent of the costs. Mr. Gore said he would raise that to half of a family's total costs for child care. This would affect about 4.4 million families.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore promoted his proposal all day, both at the child care center and in a half-dozen satellite interviews with television stations.  ''Working parents have a hard time balancing work and family,'' he told WTXL-TV, the ABC affiliate in Tallahassee, Fla.</p>
