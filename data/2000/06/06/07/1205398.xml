        <p>STONEDIAL  By George Konrad  Translated by Ivan Sanders. 290 pages.  Harcourt. $24.</p>
        <p>Near the end of the Hungarian writer George Konrad's new novel, the main character, a global wanderer and garrulous exile who has seen a lot and remembered it all, delivers a kind of valedictory speech on innocence and its consequences. The character, Janos Dragoman, a Jew who returns to the Hungarian city of his youth, is talking to a friend from his school days, recalling the illusions that their fathers entertained about the nature of human evil.</p>
        <p>''Our optimistic fathers believed that evil would not come to pass,'' Dragoman tells his friend, Kobra. ''Maybe it's because they think that next to a good person a bad one turns gentle. But this happens only until the first transgression, until he discovers that he can slap a good man too, just for the hell of it. And after that it no longer matters what kind of person he is beating to a pulp, it may be someone as innocent as a fish whose head is struck with a wooden hammer, its body cleaned and cut up and handed to the waiting customer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Konrad's ''Stonedial'' is full of the sort of political-poetic pith that one associates with the afflicted territories of Eastern Europe. His characters, mostly Jewish intellectuals who have read Dostoyevsky and experienced Stalin, reflect lengthily and with jaundiced intelligence on what has transpired.</p>
        <p>That is the main strength of this accomplished writer's new book, its sheer intellectual power, the density of its thought. Less satisfying are its occasional long-windedness and diffusenarrative structure, in which events do not so much occur as provide opportunities for the ruminations, accusations, seductions and recriminations to which its characters give voice.</p>
        <p>Reading this in some ways remarkable and in some ways tiresome book, one gets the impression that one has witnessed much of this before, in writers as varied as Milan Kundera, I. B. Singer or Vladimir Bulgakov. It is the sensibility, informed by the century's atrocities, that comes from keeping an ear  cocked to the darkly comic absurdity of things. This way of filtering experience is a defense against maudlin lamentation and self-pity, a way of absorbing lessons rather than being tied down by them -- even in the face of the most serious questions, like this one about Jews being gunned down in front of open graves:</p>
        <p>''Why did those in the second row, seeing how people in the first got mowed down after they'd stepped out of their clothes, still go ahead and take off theirs? Why did they feel it was their duty to make their executioner's job easier?''</p>
        <p>Dragoman is an extraordinary and mysterious figure whose fullness of being is what rescues ''Stonedial'' from bogging down in too much talk. Returning to the town of Kandor as a famous and prosperous writer, commentator and lecturer, he visits the friends and lovers of his earlier years. One is Antal Tombor, now the mayor of Kandor. Another is Aba Kuno, the rector of the local university, whose wife, like Tombor's wife and secretary, all have unconcealed weaknesses for Dragoman.</p>
        <p>Dragoman's role in the world is kept intentionally vague by Mr. Konrad, who one can assume is the model for his own character. He is a figure, like Melville's Bulkington, whose feet are scorched by the land. He cannot stay still. ''Who or what really he is is a narcissistic question,'' Mr. Konrad's narrator intones. ''Dragoman is one with his memory freight, with the people he's known, and with those few sponge-holes where he's been twisting and squirming over the years.''</p>
        <p>The past hangs around Dragoman like a curtain. In Kandor he is shadowed by a private detective named Svetozar who works for a vaguely sinister international business consortium called Darnok, which sells everything ''from sewing needles to prepackaged, cable-ready religious programs.'' During his stay in Kandor's best hotel, Dragoman encounters a daughter of whose existence he was unaware and a grandson named Habakuk. He remembers old loves; he thinks about the tribulations of the Jews and about the anti-Soviet uprising in Hungary in 1956, in which he was at first a reluctant and then an active participant.</p>
        <p>The events of 1956 are crucial here. It turns out that on a volcanic mountaintop called Stonedial, Dragoman unwittingly brought about the execution of six fellow protesters who were tricked by a Russian commander into giving themselves up.</p>
        <p>The tragedy was a kind of accident, and after his long absence Dragoman finds that accidents continue to happen. He has written an exegesis on the aesthetics and erotics of fire, which leads a young man he has never met to set fire to a local nightclub and then to jump to his death from Dragoman's hotel terrace. That ideas have consequences seems to be the moral here, and that one cannot entirely escape one's responsibility even if the consequences are utterly, uncontrollably absurd.</p>
        <p>Another accidental death soon follows, that of one of Dragoman's friends, the university rector, and again Dragoman is held responsible, even though he isn't. He contemplates various courses of action: to flee, as he always has before, or to face a nonsensical penalty. Dragoman's erotic interests intrude in the form of the seductions of the dead man's wife. Svetozar, whose motives regarding Dragoman are never made clear, offers to help. The local police detective, reminiscent of the detective in ''Crime and Punishment,'' discourses with evident pleasure on Dragoman's dilemma.</p>
        <p>In other words, the past repeats itself in farcical fashion. Dragoman is reminded once again that his entire life ''had been haunted by a fruitless search for a truly safe hiding place.''</p>
        <p>What is the lesson? Whatever it is, it is a complicated and ambiguous one, but surely it has something to do with the way the tendrils of our fate intertwine with all that has happened before and with everyone whose lives ours touch. Mr. Konrad's novel, translated from the Hungarian by Ivan Sanders, is too wordy, too indulgent of its author's random thoughts. But reading it, one is always in contact with a deeply informed awareness of the tragic and the tragically comic in human life, and that is what gives this book its force.</p>
