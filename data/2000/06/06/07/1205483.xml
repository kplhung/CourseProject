        <p>The City Council moved quickly yesterday to adopt a $37.6 billion budget package that would cut city taxes by more than $400 million, while increasing city spending at a rate that far exceeds inflation.</p>
        <p>The 2001 fiscal year plan, endorsed Monday by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, included a companion capital budget that authorizes $7.59 billion in spending on new or renovated schools, bridges and other projects, a nearly 15 percent jump. It is the largest capital budget in at least a decade, city officials said.</p>
        <p>The flurry of votes came with almost no dissent: the final package passed 48 to 0 with three members absent. The only delay occurred while city aides feverishly printed copies of the just compiled budget resolutions, and then Council members, including some of the most fiscally conservative Republicans, took turns to praise the budget staff and one another for their work.</p>
        <p>''This is a budget I am proud of and that the city should be proud of,'' said Stephen J. Fiala, a conservative Republican from Staten Island.</p>
        <p>But as the details of the agreement filtered out yesterday, former city officials and leaders of independent budget groups expressed growing concern that the budget package might leave the city vulnerable to future changes in the economy, even if it merely slows down.</p>
        <p>''Spending is growing faster than revenues,'' said Ronnie Lowenstein, deputy director and chief economist at the city's Independent Budget Office. ''It is simply not sustainable.''</p>
        <p>Defining just how much spending would grow in the coming year remains difficult because of the multiple ways that the city counts its spending.</p>
        <p>The Council finance staff reported late yesterday that the $27.7 billion portion of the budget that is paid for directly with city taxpayer funds would be up about 9 percent over the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. But that percentage increase may decline, the Council staff added, if more federal and state financing surfaces.</p>
        <p>Council officials and analysts from the Independent Budget Office said that even if there are adjustments for extra federal and state funds, increases in city spending in 2001 would far exceed inflation, which has been about 2 percent.</p>
        <p>The surge in spending is possible in part because of the record surpluses the supercharged city economy has generated in the last two years; the fiscal year is expected to end with an extra $3.2 billion. About $1 billion of that money is being set aside to help balance the budget in 2002 and 2003, but the rest is being spent to support programs in the coming year, city officials said.</p>
        <p>The problem, fiscal watchdogs said yesterday, is that if tax revenue dips or even does not continue to grow at the same rate, the programs the city is creating would have to be cut back, or taxes would have to be increased to sustain them.</p>
        <p>''It is hard to be prudent in good times,'' said Eugene J. Keilin, chairman of the Citizens Budget Commission and former chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the state agency that helped rescue the city during its financial crisis of the 1970's. ''But that is the only time you can put aside money for a rainy day, and they are plainly spending too much of the surplus and saving too little.''</p>
        <p>Adam L. Barsky, the director of the Giuliani administration's Office of Management and Budget, said the city's approach was prudent. ''We are not spending our surplus on unnecessary expenses,'' he said. ''And we will have adequate resources to react to any changes in the economy or other fiscal uncertainties.''</p>
        <p>The mayor has yet to sign the budget plan, and approval by the State Legislature is needed before the tax cuts can go into effect, the largest piece of which would be a reduction in the personal income tax. The changes vary, but the average tax cut for a taxpayer earning $60,000 to $70,000 a year would be $207, or 11.7 percent.</p>
        <p>The Council and mayor have warned that the tax cut plan may need to be scaled back if the State Legislature approves changes in pension benefits for more than 100,000 retired city employees, which could cost the city an extra $500 million to $1 billion that is not now included in the budget.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 8, 2000, Thursday  An article yesterday about the City Council's adoption of a budget misstated the amount of money the city plans to spend in the 2001 fiscal year that would come from city tax revenue. It is $25.4 billion, a 3 percent decline in spending from the current fiscal year, not $27.7 billion. That figure, provided by the City Council staff, was higher because it includes payments the city will make before the end of this fiscal year on June 30, to cover debt service costs that come due in the next fiscal year.</p>
