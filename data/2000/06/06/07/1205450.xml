        <p>MANHATTAN: BUS PLAN  A Manhattan judge proposed yesterday that state lawyers hammer out a temporary compromise with a suspended bus company, New York Apple Tours, and allow drivers without violations to return to the road until a final determination about the company's license is made. The city suspended the company's license after one of its buses struck and killed a man in Manhattan on May 22. At the hearing yesterday, Judge Phyllis Gangel-Jacob asked both sides to meet on Friday to try to reach a compromise.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: UNION PLEA  The former president of the union local for motor vehicle operators pleaded guilty yesterday in State Supreme Court to grand larceny and a scheme to defraud union members. The guilty plea from Robert Taylor, the former leader of Local 983 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, comes as part of a larger prosecution of officials at the union, District Council 37. Mr. Taylor pleaded guilty to stealing $50,000 from the local and rigging the vote when he ran for president. He faces up to four and a half years in prison and will have to repay $50,000 to the union.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: COW PARADE  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has filed a lawsuit against the Giuliani administration and the organizers of CowParade NYC 2000, an art exhibition of several hundred fiberglass cows set to open on June 15. One of the rejected submissions was PETA's depiction of a butcher-shop poster cow with such claims as ''eating meat causes impotence.'' The group wants a court order permitting inclusion of its cow. The parks commissioner, Henry J. Stern, noted that the cows would be in parks and other public areas. ''We wanted a nonpolitical event,'' he said.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: BLOOD SHORTAGE  The New York Blood Center said yesterday that it was running short of two essential blood types, O and B, and was appealing to residents in the region to help increase the supply. The bank, which serves 200 hospitals in New York City, Long Island, the Hudson Valley and New Jersey, has less than a two-day supply, far below the recommended five days. In December, the center said it had only half the amount of blood it considered necessary. Potential donors may call (800) 933-2566.</p>

        <p>WAWARSING: LAND FOR TRAILS  The state will buy 1,300 acres along the Shawangunk Ridge for $1.2 million, completing major hiking-trail connections in Ulster and Sullivan Counties. The land will be acquired as a state forest and used for hiking, hunting, camping and bird watching. Dene Lee, project manager for the Trust for Public Land, said the purchase protected a three-mile stretch of the Long Path, including a link to the 30-mile Shawangunk Ridge Trail, ensuring hikers improved access to the ridge.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: CHARTER SCHOOLS  The State Department of Education has made final plans for an annual charter school report card. The reports will require disclosure of various kinds of performance information. Public schools are already required to issue report cards, and private schools do so on a voluntary basis. Charter schools will have to provide the information to the State Board of Regents by Aug. 1. The results probably will not be made public until winter.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: INQUIRY POSTPONED  A Senate panel appointed to examine the state's problem-plagued auto emissions program has been stopped before it got started. The Senate president, Donald DiFrancesco, agreed yesterday to a request from the State Commission of Investigation to suspend the legislative inquiry into the $400 million contract with Parsons Infrastructure and Technology. The State Commission of Investigation asked Mr. DiFrancesco to postpone his public examination because it could interfere with the commission's own investigation.</p>

        <p>NEW BRUNSWICK: SCHOOL STABBING  A 14-year-old on probation for assault was charged with stabbing a fellow student in the back with a knife on Friday at Avenel Middle School. After learning of the probation, Judge Roger Daley of Family Court on Monday ordered the teenager, Jakub Pytel, to remain incarcerated, and requested mental health counseling for the boy. In January, an 11-year-old boy said that Jakub had hit him on the forehead as they walked home from school.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: JURY PAY RISE  The Assembly yesterday approved a bill to raise jurors' daily pay to $40 from $5. Under the bill, the state would continue to pay the current rate for the first three days of duty, then raise it by $35 a day, the first increase in 50 years. The Assembly also approved a bill that would allow municipalities to ban extreme wrestling, which is defined as having features that include deliberate cutting. Both bills must go to the Senate for approval.</p>

        <p>NEW HAVEN: TEACHER POISONING ATTEMPT  A 12-year-old girl faces charges for trying to poison her teacher by pouring chemicals into her coffee cup last month, the police said. The authorities are seeking an arrest warrant for the girl, a sixth grader at Fair Haven Middle School whose name was not released. On May 10, the girl allegedly poured bleach, laundry detergent, soda, perfume and sleeping pills into a teacher's coffee. The strange odor prevented the teacher from drinking the coffee, the police said Monday.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: JUROR PLEADS  A West Haven man faces prison time for revealing secret information he obtained when he served on a federal grand jury investigating organized crime. The man, John J. Arkison, 44, pleaded guilty on Monday to contempt of court, admitting that he violated a court order prohibiting jurors from disclosing information learned while serving on the jury. Officials said that Mr. Arkison told a person who was not on the jury about an alleged sports bookmaker who was ''in a lot of trouble.''</p>
