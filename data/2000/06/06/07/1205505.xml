        <p>There are apartments with roach problems. There are apartments with rodent problems. But an apartment with a snake problem?</p>
        <p>Linda Fennimore, a jazz violinist who lives on the Upper West Side, has a boa constrictor problem.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fennimore discovered her unwanted reptilian roommate when it shed its skin in her sheet music. Ever since, she has been dialing around, frantically looking for help -- from the police, from the super, from animal protection societies, from the Bronx Zoo, from the Museum of Natural History.</p>
        <p>They all tell her the same thing. The boa most likely remains coiled somewhere in her studio apartment, hiding. And it probably won't bite her or wrap itself around a limb. Really. Unless she startles it.</p>
        <p>''I don't mind being here so much when I am conscious,'' she said yesterday. ''It's the idea of sleeping here that I find nerve-racking. I haven't done it for a week.''</p>
        <p>It started last Wednesday when she was rummaging through her music cabinet for a Charlie Parker tune. She found what she thought was some bubble wrap. But dumped on a kitchen counter, it looked like snakeskin. ''I thought I was losing it, that I had been practicing way too long,'' Ms. Fennimore said.</p>
        <p>So she called 911. She said the two police officers who appeared said it was definitely snakeskin, glanced in the corners, then left, suggesting she call back anytime the snake appeared.</p>
        <p>The super came and left in a hurry, the next day dispatching four or five men with gloves and picks. Still no snake.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fennimore called everything in the phone book with ''pest'' in its name. No help. Finally, she reached the New York Herpetological Society (the name means it studies reptiles). A man there was headed past the Museum of Natural History, where he was getting off the subway just long enough to hand some frozen mice to Dave Karrmann of the museum.</p>
        <p>''He said if I showed up on the platform with the snakeskin they could at least tell me what kind of snake it was,'' Ms. Fennimore said. ''I kept going up to these guys on the platform asking 'Dave?' and finally one turned out to be the right guy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Karrmann told her it came from a 54-inch boa constrictor and had been shed within the last two weeks. He and some interns came and searched her apartment, crammed with 18 years' worth of possessions. They found nothing. A few ideas were broached for trapping, like keeping a live rat in a cage in her apartment -- the snake would wrap itself around the cage, trying to get at the rat, and stay there. Instead, she tried playing the violin to coax it out. Still no snake.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fennimore put up notices in the elevator of her building at 41 West 81st Street, suggesting that anyone who lost a pet boa come collect it. Nobody stepped forward. Boas are illegal as pets in New York and fines can range from $100 to $3,000. But they remain popular.</p>
        <p>''People are always fascinated by reptiles,'' said Jim Breheny, a curator at the Bronx Zoo. ''It is that thin line between amazement and repulsion.''</p>
        <p>In the building, repulsion won. The super quickly took the signs down, saying it was making the other tenants too nervous.</p>
        <p>Some of the experts said it could be a female snake that would lay eggs. ''I could end up with a whole family in here,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fennimore's lease is up this month and she has to decide which is the harder choice, sleeping with a snake somewhere in her $483-a-month studio or facing New York City's housing market.</p>
        <p>''Maybe it's time to move,'' she said.</p>
