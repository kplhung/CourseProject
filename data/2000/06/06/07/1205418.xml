        <p>Florida mango season begins right now, and for mango lovers, even with the descent of inescapable heat and thick humidity, these are times of happy anticipation. Each month brings a new variety: the peach-flavored Van Dyke in mid-June; the luscious Kent in July; the huge, creamy Keitt in August.</p>
        <p>It used to be the best time of year for Frank Mitchell, too. He comes from a family that farmed 350 acres of mangoes during the 1970's, the glory days of the Florida mango. The Mitchell empire stretched over 20 miles, from the outskirts of Miami to the heart of Homestead. There were groves next to suburban subdivisions, and groves planted right beside the wilds of the Everglades.</p>
        <p>But today, all that remains is a single five-acre orchard. We clambered into Mr. Mitchell's pickup truck and drove to his last grove to understand why growing mangoes has become such a difficult proposition in the place that gave the industry its birth. Ninety-nine percent of the mangoes in American supermarkets are imported from South America and the Caribbean -- but they are all varieties developed here in South Florida.</p>
        <p>The groves left -- eight acres here, 20 acres there -- provide the mangoes I buy two for a dollar at roadside stands and farmers markets. Occasionally, Florida mangoes will be shipped up the East Coast as far as New York. If you can find them, they're well worth purchasing; Florida mangoes will be immediately recognizable by their sheer heft and uncommon succulence.</p>
        <p>The groves have been quietly disappearing for 10 years. Foreign competition made the crop less profitable, and growers began selling their land to developers. Then Hurricane Andrew decimated the groves in 1992, and almost no one replanted mangoes.</p>
        <p>''Florida growers just can't afford to compete with the growers from Latin American,'' said Eddie Caram, the director of purchased fruit for Florida's largest exotic fruit purveyor, Brooks Tropicals, in Homestead.</p>
        <p>''You do the math,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''Mexican mangoes sell for $2.50 a flat. We have to get $3.50 to $4 just to break even.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell's father, Edward, started planting mangoes in this farming community near Miami in the early 1950's. At an annual meeting of the Mango Forum, where amateur horticulturists could show off prize mangos from their backyards, he took a liking to a juicy, bright red mango grown by a man named Tommy Atkins. He bought the tree and rights to the name and set about commercializing it. Today, the Tommy Atkins is the best-selling variety in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
        <p>Homestead is the center of the Florida tropical fruit industry. It is 45 minutes south of Miami, but it could be another country. Roads as straight as a rifle shot lead past endless miles of lime and avocado groves, palm trees, and landscaping nurseries, the backbone of the local economy. The land is as flat as an ironing board, and the sun burns down like a blowtorch.</p>
        <p>By all rights, there shouldn't be farming here at all, because just beneath the soil is a hard shelf of limestone. To plant trees, growers must first plow the limestone or grind it up, using fertilizers to provide the nutrients. One grower I know likens farming here to hydroponic growing. Mr. Mitchell says he doesn't mind the poverty of the soil.</p>
        <p>''It lets us control the mango's diet,'' he said. He also appreciates the hot sun and the abundant rainfall. What he doesn't like is the humidity. Mangoes grown in South Florida are susceptible to a spotty black mold called anthracnose. ''Half of the expense of growing mangoes goes into the fungicides sprayed weekly to keep this pest under control,'' Mr. Mitchell said.</p>
        <p>The mango is a handsome tree with long, slender leaves that droop with dapper elegance. The trees flower from January through March and set fruit about a month after. A baby mango looks like a tiny green kidney bean and grows from a long stem called a panicle that hangs vertically from the branch. It takes about five years for a mango tree to fruit, and eight to 10 years for it to become productive enough to pay for the cost of growing it. Each year, a tree produces five or six bushels (50 to 60 fruits a bushel), although some produce as many as 20 bushels. Mr. Mitchell's little grove will yield 1,500 bushels.</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, the Mitchells employed 150 workers -- 100 in the fields and 50 in the packing house. Trucks loaded with mangoes would rumble in hourly to a packing plant south of Miami. They shipped 120,000 pounds of fruit a day across the United States and Canada. The company exported mangoes to Europe and as far as Australia.</p>
        <p>JUST about everything has changed since then. Now, the pickers are contract workers. The men who arrived for work at Mitchell's grove at about 7:30 one morning last week came from Mexico and Honduras, Guatemala and Haiti. Armed with bright plastic baskets and pole pickers (blue aluminum pool poles crowned with an inverted V-shaped cutter and a nylon bag), they invaded the grove, gathering the low lying fruit by hand, and used the poles to reach higher branches.</p>
        <p>To use a picker pole, you position the cutter above the fruit and gently pull down: the blade severs the panicle, and the mango falls into the bag.  When the bag is full, you lower the pole and transfer the mangoes to the bucket. It looks easy, but your shoulders will ache after 20 minutes. You can only imagine what it feels like to pick mangoes for 10 hours straight.</p>
        <p>It doesn't take long for the men to fill the 30-pound buckets -- 30 seconds, maybe a minute for hand-picked fruit, five minutes using the pole. The buckets are dumped into 20-bushel wooden bins arranged on the back of a flatbed truck. When the bins are full, they're driven to Mitchell's processing center, where they'll be washed with a high pressure water hose, then sold in bulk.</p>
        <p>The pickers are paid $2.50 a bushel (55 pounds), and a good picker can pick 2,000 to 3,000 pounds a day. It's hard work, lasting until 4:30 or 5 p.m., and when it's over, a picker will walk away with about $100.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell's seasoned hand can tell how many days a particular fruit has until it's ready for harvest. ''You don't go by color; you look at this,'' he said, pointing to a sort of dimple in the back of the mango. ''When it's filled out, the mango is ready.''</p>
        <p>The harvest lasts only three months, but growing mangoes is a year-round endeavor. After the harvest, the trees must be topped, using a device that looks like a giant whirligig, and pruned, with what appears to be large mechanized hedge shears. Next come fertilizing, nutritional sprays and weed killing. Special care is taken to eliminate the live-forevers, a vigorous vine that can strangle a tree.</p>
        <p>Mangoes have been cultivated in Asia for thousands of years. But Florida has proved an extraordinary breeding ground. The Asian and Indian varieties brought here by early horticulturists like David Fairchild and Captain Haden cross-pollinated and flourished in the area between the Atlantic and the Everglades. Hundreds of new cultivars developed here that were far superior to their Asian and Indian parents.</p>
        <p>From the 1950's to the 1970's, Florida provided the rest of the country -- especially New York -- with the bulk of its mangoes. But the very success of the Florida mango led to its demise.</p>
        <p>Demand for mangoes exploded in the 1980's, as Americans developed a passion for the fruit. In 1988, 92 million pounds were sold in the United States. Ten years later, the number had skyrocketed to 412 million pounds, said Kelly Barton, the marketing director for The Packer, an industry newsletter. To meet the demand, growers from Mexico and Central America started coming to South Florida to learn how to grow mangoes more efficiently and to purchase the popular Florida trees.</p>
        <p>It turned out the mangoes thrive in the warm climate of western Mexico, Central America, Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. What's more, these regions are less humid than South Florida, so the mangoes need less of the costly fungicide. And labor is a fraction of the cost.</p>
        <p>The industry was already shrinking when Hurricane Andrew roared through in 1992, destroying half the area's mango groves. But the real death knell, Mr. Mitchell and other growers say, was sounded by the passing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, which removed tariffs on imported fruit. Florida growers simply couldn't compete.</p>
        <p>SOUTH FLORIDA is one of the few places in the United States where you can grow mangoes -- a fact appreciated by David Fairchild, who founded the United States Agriculture Department's Office of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction in 1898. Mr. Fairchild traveled the world looking for new tropical fruits for the United States, introducing thousands of plant varieties, including hundreds of mangoes.</p>
        <p>Today, Fairchild Tropical Garden has the most diverse mango collection in the world, with more than 180 varieties. Strolling the garden's genetic bank, a rolling three-and-a-half-acre orchard in southern Miami, you'll find Turpentine mangoes from the Caribbean, Naomi mangoes from Israel, Cambodiana mangoes from the Philippines and Ivory mangoes from Thailand. When growers from Florida, Mexico or South Africa need information on mangoes or cuttings, this is where they come.</p>
        <p>Presiding over these remarkable holdings is Dr. Richard Campbell, a young horticulturist with an endless enthusiasm for mangoes. He wrote one of the definitive guides to mango varieties, ''Mangos: A Guide to Mangos in Florida,'' published in 1992 and available by mail from Fairchild Tropical Garden (10901 Old Cutler Road, Miami, Fla. 33156), when he was only 28. Today, he spends eight weeks a year roaming the world to collect exotic fruit trees. He probably knows more about mangoes than anyone else in the world. One of Dr. Campbell's missions is to collect information on the world's mangoes -- how they grow, look and taste and how to improve them. His 120-item mango evaluation sheet looks like something at a wine tasting.</p>
        <p>Dr. Campbell also works on new varieties. He is developing a dwarf mango tree that will bear almost as much fruit as a full-size adult.</p>
        <p>''This is the future of the mango in Florida,'' he said, pointing proudly to a tree that's about as tall as I am, its branches pendulous with large purple fruit. ''They're small enough to fit in your backyard.''</p>
        <p>Back at Mr. Mitchell's office, he pulled out a pocketknife and sliced into some mangoes he had arranged on a table for me to taste. There were sweet, creamy Glenns, aromatic Hadens and pungent Tommy Atkins.  The first thing that struck me was just how explosively flavorful these mangoes were. More flavorful than ripe Georgia peaches or golden pineapples. More flavorful than just about any fruit I had tasted.</p>
        <p>Next, it struck me how sad it is that people outside my home state won't be able to taste this extraordinary fruit. I'm not worried that the Florida mango will disappear in my lifetime -- we Floridians love our mangoes too much for that. But it is a shame that it will be a wonder confined to my own backyard.</p>
