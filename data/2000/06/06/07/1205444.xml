        <p>On a late afternoon patrol in the foothills of Freetown, the young British soldiers went into a neighborhood of dilapidated clapboard houses, drawing greetings and waves from the locals.</p>
        <p>They walked up a winding road of reddish earth still glistening from the intermittent, seasonal rains that began soon after British troops arrived a month ago to prop up a United Nations peacekeeping force that seemed on the verge of collapse.</p>
        <p>It was the last patrol for these soldiers, 14 members of the Royal Marines' 42nd commando. In mid-June, the 800 marines here are to leave this former British colony, in keeping with their mission's timetable. To cap what the British government clearly considers a foreign policy success, Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, is expected to visit Freetown, Sierra Leone's seaside capital, on Thursday.</p>
        <p>''I believe that given our aim, which was to evacuate people and to give the U.N. and the government another chance, we've all achieved that,'' Brig. David Richards, the British force commander here, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>What the government and the United Nations will do with their second chance is much less clear, however. United Nations officials, who will remain in charge of the peacekeeping forces, say that with reinforcements last month and more expected in the near future, they can stand up to the Revolutionary United Front, which took 500 peacekeepers hostage last month and steered Sierra Leone back to war.</p>
        <p>But privately, officials with the United Nations and other international humanitarian organizations, as well as diplomats in the region, express doubts about a post-British future. The misgivings are echoed openly on the streets of Freetown, which was invaded by rebels last year despite a Nigerian-led West Africa peacekeeping force.</p>
        <p>''We love the British soldiers -- they are showing some military guarantee,'' said Bobby Kamara, a 19-year-old student who was buying flip-flops at a market patrolled by the 14 marines. ''They are well equipped. They are not afraid like the U.N., like the Kenyans and Zambians who just gave up their arms and were taken hostage. They are not here to take any rubbish. We want them to stay with us. We don't want them to leave.''</p>
        <p>''Thank you!'' said Mohammed Barry, the flip-flop salesman, nodding furiously in agreement.</p>
        <p>Oluyemi Adeniji, the United Nations special envoy to Sierra Leone, said Britain's role had been exaggerated, especially by the British media, which often described British officials as having taken over control of the United Nations. ''Of course we cannot pretend that their presence here has not helped,'' Mr. Adeniji said in an interview. ''Certainly it has helped tremendously. We, however, feel that their departure will not make too much difference.''</p>
        <p>British officials themselves say that their role has been overdrawn. But what they have done in Sierra Leone has been evident to anyone here: British soldiers secured western Freetown and the international airport at Lungi; elite commando units were often seen near the front line alongside pro-government forces; the British gathered intelligence and advised United Nations and government officials.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important was the reassuring presence of a highly organized and equipped army, underscored by the eight British warships anchored off the coast of Freetown.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the United Nations peacekeeping force was -- and seems to remain -- in disarray under the command of Maj. Gen. Vijay K. Jetley, an Indian who reports to Mr. Adeniji, the United Nations special envoy here. Recently, according to United Nations, military and diplomatic officials, Jordanian troops refused an order to stay the night at a strategic spot on the highway out of Freetown, retreating to the safer town of Masiaka; on Friday, 500 Indian troops were dispatched to Rogberi Junction, but only after other nationalities refused General Jetley's order to send soldiers there.</p>
        <p>The Nigerians, who led a West African peacekeeping force here for years and make up the United Nations' largest contingent, remain displeased that an Indian is leading the force. Meanwhile, there are persistent rumors inside the United Nations building in Freetown, reflected in the local press, that General Jetley will be replaced.</p>
        <p>What is more, a clearly worried United Nations headquarters in New York has sent over a seven-member assessment team, an unusual step at this stage of a mission. The team members are interviewing people inside and outside the United Nations about what has gone wrong.</p>
        <p>In early May, the United Nations force seemed about to collapse after the Revolutionary United Front, led by Foday Sankoh, kidnapped about 500 peacekeepers. At one point, the rebels marched toward Freetown, causing the United Nations to declare -- mistakenly, it turned out -- that the capital was about to be invaded within hours.</p>
        <p>The British helped restore calm in Freetown. But as the opposition in London criticized the Blair government for getting involved in a country of little strategic interest -- using words like ''quagmire'' and ''Somalia'' -- the government tended to play down its involvement here. That, in turn, appeared to fuel speculation in the British media of a secret war in Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>The British government's role in Sierra Leone had created problems for London in the past. In 1998, the British media reported that the British government had worked with a British mercenary firm, Sandline International, in supplying arms and training to the government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, in violation of a United Nations arms embargo on this country.</p>
        <p>Unlike the French, who kept close ties with their former African colonies after independence four decades ago, the British maintained a more distant relationship. But in Sierra Leone, whose capital was founded by the British for freed slaves, the near-collapse of a Sierra Leonean government led to an unusually high degree of British involvement here recently.</p>
        <p>There are now British advisers in several ministries, including defense and finance. Since last year, the Sierra Leone police have been led by a Briton, Inspector General Keith Biddle. Before the marines leave in mid-June, a delegation of 180 British military officials is supposed to arrive to train the first 1,000 soldiers for Sierra Leone's new army. A smaller group is expected to stay for three years to reconstruct the army.</p>
        <p>''I would like them to stay for the next 10 years,'' Noah Kamara, 25, a former soldier who is now loyal to the pro-government warlord, Johnny Paul Koroma, said as he watched the 14 marines on patrol. ''We want to be educated by these people. We are willing to abide by their rules so that we, too, can gain more experience.''</p>
        <p>Unlike other Africans, Sierra Leoneans seldom express resentment toward their former colonizers, perhaps because their suffering under their own leaders has been so great.</p>
        <p>Brigadier Richards has tried to allay Sierra Leoneans' fears over the British departure, appearing, for example, on radio shows.</p>
        <p>''Militarily, we had an enormous impact for the first 7 to 10 days,'' he said. ''Most importantly, we raised everybody's morale. It was rock-bottom. And any good army turning up here would have had the same effect. But there is actually a very genuine affection for the British here. I've never seen anything like it. We're always being asked: 'Will you come back and recolonize? And will you be vice president, brigadier?' ''</p>
