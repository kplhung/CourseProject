        <p>The Merce Cunningham Dance Foundation Collection, an assemblage of dance documentation and memorabilia that goes back to the 1930's and includes some 6,000 hours of film and video material, is going to the New York Public Library, the library announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>The collection, a gift from the Cunningham foundation, will be moved to the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center over the next three years.</p>
        <p>Paul LeClerc, president of the New York Public Library, described Mr. Cunningham as ''one of America's supreme geniuses, open, it seems, to every source of inspiration and nimble enough to adapt to new technologies in the interest of his art.'' At a news conference at the library's 42nd Street headquarters, Dr. LeClerc described the collection as one of the performing arts library's most remarkable and important acquisitions, inspiring, he added teasingly,  the lust of Madeleine Nichols, curator of the dance division at performing arts library.</p>
        <p>The library's recent major performing arts acquisitions include Jerome Robbins's personal archives and Rudolf Nureyev's video archives. Mr. Cunningham is a pioneering avant-gardist whose choreography, like that of George Balanchine, influenced dance throughout the world. But the Cunningham collection is of even greater importance because of his involvement with major 20th-century American painters, among them Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Frank Stella, and composers including John Cage, Mr. Cunningham's longtime collaborator. The Cunningham archives will be housed with the John Cage Music Manuscript Collection, which the library acquired in 1995.</p>
        <p>In addition to the film and video material, which has been carefully preserved, the Cunningham collection includes performance programs, fliers, photographs and posters, recorded interviews and news broadcasts, and Mr. Cunningham's computer files and extensive choreographic notes. Mr. Cunningham said wryly yesterday that such notes, ''hieroglyphics on the backs of sheets of paper'' that sometimes also recorded grocery lists, might help answer the question of what choreographers think of while making a dance.</p>
        <p>The materials have been collected since 1959 by David Vaughan, a dance writer and the first in-house archivist in an American dance company. They will be available to the public with the exception of Mr. Cunningham's choreographic notes, which are to be opened in 2024. The dance materials will not be available on the library's Web site because of artistic considerations, said William D. Walker, senior vice president and Andrew W. Mellon director of the research libraries. ''Anyone could use, alter or cut and paste them.''</p>
        <p>Was there a connecting thread in these archives of some seven decades? ''One misadventure to another,'' Mr. Cunningham answered.</p>
