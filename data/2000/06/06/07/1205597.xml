        <p>It appears increasingly likely that Kevin Lowe will follow his mentor, Glen Sather, to New York and become the new head coach of the Rangers.</p>
        <p>Cal Nichols, chairman of the 37-man ownership group of the Edmonton Oilers, disclosed yesterday that Lowe had formally exercised the option in his contract allowing him to become a free agent if Sather left the Oilers.</p>
        <p>''I've heard rumors about that,'' Sather said last night. ''I can't make any comment on it until they've officially notified the league.''</p>
        <p>Lowe was a first-year coach with the Oilers this season. They have offered him the general manager job vacated by Sather on May 19. But a pivotal meeting in Edmonton yesterday apparently produced little, and afterward Nichols sounded as if the ownership group was distancing itself from Lowe.</p>
        <p>''There are those who would have questioned whether he's got enough experience,'' Nichols said of the 41-year-old Lowe, who has no experience as a general manager. ''He was great as a player and as a coach, but a general manager's job is a different job description. Everyone is confident he could do the job eventually. But in the short term? We know he'll be a fine G.M. in the long term.''</p>
        <p>Lowe was unavailable for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>''I have not spoken to Kevin,'' said Sather, who was named president and general manager of the Rangers on June 1, after 24 years with the Oilers, the last 21 as general manager.</p>
        <p>The 56-year-old Sather is scheduled to be in Edmonton tomorrow  to tie up some loose ends. The chance has grown considerably that when Sather leaves town, he will take Lowe with him.</p>
