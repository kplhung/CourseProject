        <p>MOST United States airlines began selling tickets over the Internet in 1996, but it was a halfhearted effort because many airline officials viewed it as little more than the latest electronic plaything. Now the airlines are making up for lost time, going after potential passengers by adding more Web sites as well as forming partnerships with online retailers better known for selling electronic products or sporting goods than airline tickets.</p>
        <p>The targets of the carriers' most recent aggressiveness are the big online travel companies like Travelocity, Expedia and Priceline. These were quick off the mark and sell about the same percentage of online travel as the airlines do.</p>
        <p>An example of their power became obvious when Delta Airlines made its unsold seats available to Priceline.com last summer. Until then, the major airlines had balked at doing so, but after Delta's move, they followed suit.</p>
        <p>Presumably seeking to lessen the power of the online travel companies, an alliance of 27 domestic and international airlines, tentatively called T2, had planned to open a ''one-stop shopping'' site this summer, allowing customers to book what the carriers said would be the biggest selection of low fares available anywhere on the Internet. The alliance's site would have also allowed customers to book hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and package tours.</p>
        <p>But in mid-May, the Justice Department said it would investigate whether T2, the brainchild of Continental, Delta, Northwest and United, would violate antitrust regulations. Even in the absence of such a finding, T2's start-up date is likely be delayed.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the American Society of Travel Agents, which asked the Justice Department to investigate T2, amended its original complaint to include the newly announced Web site of 11 European carriers. That as-yet-unnamed alliance, whose Web site was expected to be up later this year, includes British Airways, Alitalia, Aer Lingus, KLM and Lufthansa.</p>
        <p>These new alliances, if they ever get going, will provide Internet users access to a far greater range of fares and flight information. Several airlines already alert passengers to flight cancellations and delays via e-mail messages, and other carriers are about to follow that lead.</p>
        <p>Buying tickets online has certainly taken off. Last year, according to Jupiter Communications, the e-commerce research company, online travel spending reached $6.5 billion, or 4.5 percent of all travel spending, and is projected by Jupiter to soar to $28.2 billion in 2005, or 14.2 percent. More to the point, Jupiter said that airline tickets accounted for a whopping 77 percent of online travel purchases last year.</p>
        <p>While the airlines' share of online travel spending will begin to slow by mid-decade, as hotels, rental cars and cruise ships expand their presence on the Internet, they are expected to rule the online travel roost by a big margin for the forseeable future, according to Jupiter.</p>
        <p>Revenue from tickets purchased online is minuscule compared with the major airlines' estimated $118 billion in revenue last year, and an undetermined but apparently satisfactory percentage came from buyers attracted to the Web. These passengers are ones who could not resist the rock-bottom fares offered on the Internet by airlines that would rather give deep discounts than fly with empty seats; who fly rather than drive or take the bus; and who know a good deal.</p>
        <p>Anne A. Cheng, a professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley, belongs to the last group -- as, presumably, do the many other Internet aficionados who have helped bolster ridership on United States airlines to a record 634 million passengers last year, an increase of 53 million just since 1996.</p>
        <p>''I've been buying all my tickets online for about a year,'' Professor Cheng said, adding that first she had to allay her fears about paying by credit card over the Internet.  Now she uses airline Web sites exclusively, especially United's, where she and her husband, Marc Freedman, who runs a nonprofit organization, have found bargains on United flights as well as listings of low fares on rival carriers and discounts for flights booked on the Internet. As a result, they have flown to London, Tokyo, Hawaii, New York and Savannah, Ga.</p>
        <p>Because of such enthusiasts, online bookings are soaring this year. Southwest Airlines booked more than $300 million on its Web site (southwest.com) in the first three months of this year, double its Web site sales during the same period in 1999. With online sales accounting for more than 25 percent of total passenger revenue in the quarter, Southwest says it is on its way to earning more than $1 billion in e-commerce revenue by the year's end.</p>
        <p>On March 13, United Airlines sold $2.7 million in tickets through its various Web sites, more than twice its previous single-day record established six months earlier.  In 1999, United sold more than $500 million  of tickets over the Internet, more than double its 1998 Internet sales. In the first three months of this year, it sold $153 million in tickets through the Internet, 150 percent above the same period in 1999.</p>
        <p>''We sold 5 percent of our tickets over the Internet last year,'' said Kurt Ebenhoch, a United spokesman. ''But we expect that to rise to 20 percent by 2003.'' The industry average is 4.3 percent, according to Jupiter Communications, which estimates that the percentage will rise to 11.1 percent in three years.</p>
        <p>ABIG Internet surprise to airlines, and a big source of incremental revenue (revenue beyond expectations), is the sales of tickets booked by e-mail that offer steep discounts for weekend travel on routes that the planes would otherwise fly with many empty seats.</p>
        <p>''When we first started the e-fares in March 1996, we offered them in our hub airports,'' said John Hotard, an American Airlines spokesman, referring to the carrier's locations in cities like Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago and New York. The promotion proved so popular that it was expanded to other cities. It now has 2.2 million weekly subscribers (people who sign up to receive weekly information by e-mail for weekend traveling) and enough passengers willing to fly at the last minute to add at least $12 million a year -- although probably much more -- in incremental revenue to American's coffers.</p>
        <p>Some examples of such fares include Miami to San Francisco for $289; New York to Seattle, $300; Boston to Dallas-Fort Worth, $189; and Newark to Rio de Janeiro, $339.</p>
        <p>To attract and keep Web surfers, airlines  are not only making their Web sites more navigable, but are also creating multiple sites. United, for example, can be logged on to at united airlines.com, united.com and ual.com and at the sites of three airline alliances. The best known is the 11-member Star Alliance (staralliance.com), whose other partners represent carriers from Austria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand and (because Scandinavian Airlines is the national carrier of three nations) Denmark, Norway and Sweden.</p>
        <p>Airlines make no secret of their wish to drive passengers to their own sites, to eliminate commissions paid to travel agents, to lower the cost of maintaining their reservations systems and, if possible, lower or to eliminate the cost of bookings made through  global reservations systems like Amadeus, Galileo, Sabre and Worldspan. They also hope to eliminate credit card fees by introducing a direct-payment system.</p>
        <p>Whether or not they succeed, airlines say they have every intention of expanding their presence online. With customers like Professor Cheng, there does not seem to be much standing in their way.</p>
