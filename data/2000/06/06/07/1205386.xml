        <p>Bobby Lienau, Bobby Big Fish to his friends, says more money will be spent this year sponsoring sport fishing than ever before. ''I think fishing is going nowhere but up,'' he said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>And so is his booming Web site, www.bigfishtackle.com.</p>
        <p>From February 1999 to last December, Mr. Lienau's business increased 1,600 percent because of the site, which is getting almost 150,000 visitors a month, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lienau, 30, learned the fishing business on boats in Hawaii and in San Diego and Long Beach, Calif., before pooling his money with a loan from his family and opening Bigfishtackle, a store in Seal Beach, Calif., in 1994. In late 1998, he started his Web site, originally to advertise his fishing tackle, give customers a forum to talk about fishing and help them find good fishing spots.</p>
        <p>The site now links to virtual fishing tournaments and online fishing magazines. It lists more than 1,000 charters, as well as fishing message boards and chat rooms, fishing raffles, fishing classifieds, lunar tables, a large database of fish species nationwide, a children's corner, greeting cards, weekly prizes and the essentials: fishing tips, jokes and articles with titles like ''Crappie Attack'' and ''L.A. Area Shipwrecks.''</p>
        <p>Bigfishtackle is by no means just a Pacific Coast site. Florida is one of Mr. Lienau's top three markets, and about 20 percent of his business is international. Among his contributors are an expert on Kentucky muskies and a ''catfish master'' from Missouri. He now has 14 employees on his Web site, and he is signing up four members a month for Team Bigfish: sportsmen, writers, a professional hockey player (he likes Dakota walleyes) and other experienced fishermen who promote the site in return for a page on it.</p>
        <p>Sales of sport fishing equipment totaled $1.92 billion in 1999, said Tom B. Doyle, a vice president for information and research at the National Sporting Goods Association in Mount Prospect, Ill. Online sales of all sporting equipment is still only a tiny share of the market, about one-half of 1 percent, he said.</p>
        <p>Still, fishing is a growth business on the Web, Mr. Lienau reasoned. ''Allthe businessmen already have their computers,'' he said. ''The fishermen are getting them one by one.''</p>
