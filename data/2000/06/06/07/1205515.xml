        <p>On a sharply divided Supreme Court, the principle that liberal and conservative justices increasingly seem to agree on is the right to privacy. This principle was affirmed in two decisions on Monday, strengthening the right of parents to raise their own children and the right of individuals to conceal their private papers.</p>
        <p>It may seem odd that this court would affirm the right to privacy. Most of the current justices were appointed by Republican presidents who insisted that the court had erred in the 1960's and 70's, when it discovered a constitutional right to privacy in cases like Griswold v. Connecticut and Roe v. Wade. But these cases, which established the rights, respectively, to use contraception and to choose abortion, were not really about privacy. The court was using the concept of privacy as an imprecise way of establishing the right to sexual autonomy.</p>

        <p>On a sharply divided Supreme Court, the principle that liberal and conservative justices increasingly seem to agree on is the right to privacy. This principle was affirmed in two decisions on Monday, strengthening the right of parents to raise their own children and the right of individuals to conceal their private papers.</p>
        <p>It may seem odd that this court would affirm the right to privacy. Most of the current justices were appointed by Republican presidents who insisted that the court had erred in the 1960's and 70's, when it discovered a constitutional right to privacy in cases like Griswold v. Connecticut and Roe v. Wade. But these cases, which established the rights, respectively, to use contraception and to choose abortion, were not really about privacy. The court was using the concept of privacy as an imprecise way of establishing the right to sexual autonomy.</p>
        <p>In the most recent Supreme Court cases, by contrast, the justices are resurrecting a different concept of privacy, with explicit constitutional roots in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments: the right of people to protect the privacy of their ''persons, houses, papers, and effects'' from unreasonable state scrutiny.</p>
        <p>On Monday, by 6 to 3, the court held that a Washington State law went too far by allowing a judge to grant ''any person'' rights to visit a child over a mother's objections. Declaring that parents have a ''fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control'' of their children, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's plurality opinion  held that the state court had injected itself ''into the private realm of the family'' when it ordered visitation rights for grandparents without evidence that the mother was unfit.</p>
        <p>The court reaffirmed decisions from the early 20th century that found  that parents had the right to send their children to private school and to teach them foreign languages. In the process, the court reaffirmed the right of parents, rather than the state, to define the boundaries of the home.</p>
        <p>In the other case decided on Monday, the court, voting 8-to-1, rejected the effort by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, to indict Webster Hubbell for tax evasion after he had issued a subpoena for Mr. Hubbell's private papers and promised him immunity from prosecution.</p>
        <p>When the Constitution was drafted, the search of a private diary was considered the quintessential example of an unreasonable search. In a majestic opinion in the late 19th century, the Supreme Court held that a subpoena for business papers violated both the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, and the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits compelled self-incrimination.</p>
        <p>By the late 1980's, the court had whittled away at this crucial protection. In 1994, when Bob Packwood tried to conceal his diaries from Senate investigators, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson concluded that the Fifth Amendment no longer protected the content of private papers from state scrutiny. The Supreme Court refused to review this decision, and when Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Monica Lewinsky's computer and resurrected her unsent electronic love letters, she had no legal recourse.</p>
        <p>In the Hubbell case this week, the court breathed a little life into the tattered Fifth Amendment protections: the justices held in the opinion that when the government has ''no prior knowledge of either the existence or the whereabouts'' of private papers, it can't use subpoenas to go on fishing expeditions for possibly incriminating evidence and then indict citizens based on the papers that they are forced to produce.</p>
        <p>In a bold concurring opinion, Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia went further still, suggesting that they might be prepared to resurrect the 19th century principle that the Fifth Amendment protects the content of incriminating private papers from state scrutiny, whether or not the government knows of their existence in advance. If this position had been adopted earlier, the diaries of Bob Packwood and Monica Lewinsky might have remained private.</p>
        <p>These decisions were only the most recent Supreme Court victories for privacy. In January, the court unanimously upheld the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, in which Congress forbade greedy state departments of motor vehicles from collecting personal information like names, addresses and medical data and then selling it to businesses without a driver's consent.</p>
        <p>And in December, in a 7-to-2 decision, the court upheld a California law prohibiting commercial information services from obtaining some police records that are routinely available to journalists and others who agree not to use the information to sell a product or service.</p>
        <p>What can explain the recent victories for privacy?  Perhaps the justices, who guard their own privacy more zealously than other federal officials, are beginning to recognize how much is lost when citizens cannot record their thoughts and share intimate information without fear of exposure.</p>
        <p>Perhaps they remember the crucibles of their own confirmation hearings; they may feel violated when their own deliberations are exposed.</p>
        <p>Perhaps, regardless of their dramatically different views about abortion and contraception, both liberal and conservative justices are returning to the original understanding of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, which had promised all Americans the right to control personal information.</p>
        <p>Perhaps they were embarrassed by the Starr investigation, which showed just how dramatically traditional protections of privacy have been allowed to atrophy.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the explanation, the court's rediscovery of the right to privacy is a cause for celebration. In an age when independent counsels, state legislatures, police forces and nosy employers are all too ready to violate privacy, it's a relief that the justices are beginning to defend it.</p>
