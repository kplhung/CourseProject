        <p>A WEB celebrity isn't just a Bill Gates or a Jeff Bezos or even a Matt Drudge. It is also someone who fills a niche and has a distinctive signature, something powerful and compelling to say.</p>
        <p>The Internet has created many Web celebrities, large and small, over the last five years, and a variety of them are profiled in this section, from a legendary session musician to a genealogy guru to a jet-engine aficionado to Russell J. Jacobson, the paleontologist and dinosaur hunter who created Dino Russ's Lair.</p>
        <p>Where can you go for quick information about a dinosaur heart? Learn why brontosaurus is now apatosaurus? Get accurate art of T. rex for your 10-year-old's bedroom? Download a list of paleontology field trips that welcome amateur bone diggers? And find dinosaur courses online?</p>
        <p>A searcher would probably not seek out Room 222 of the Coal Section of the Illinois State Geological Survey in Champaign, Ill. Officially, it is the office of Mr. Jacobson, a 49-year-old state geologist. But to online dinosaur fans worldwide, it is Dino Russ's Lair, www.isgs.uiuc.edu /dinos/dinos</p>
