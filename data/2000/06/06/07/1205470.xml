        <p>Ever since it embarked on a new strategy in February to focus on its heavyweight brands like Ragu spaghetti sauce, Lipton tea and Dove soap, Unilever P.L.C., the British-Dutch consumer goods giant, has been on a buying spree in the United States, snapping up Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade and Slim-Fast Foods in a single day in April.</p>
        <p>Today, with its $20.3 billion acquisition of Bestfoods, of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Unilever has put itself in what it considers a position of overwhelming global strength.</p>
        <p>The deal ''gives us the strength and the reach to compete in today's ever more difficult world,'' said Niall FitzGerald, Unilever's London-based co-chairman. The question now, however, is whether the company may have overreached its ability to complete its spate of acquisitions and at the same time achieve the goals of its planned streamlining.</p>
        <p>Mr. FitzGerald denied that Unilever had taken on too much.</p>
        <p>''It clearly is a challenging task, but we didn't go into this with our eyes closed,'' he said, arguing that the acquisition -- which is likely to face regulatory hurdles in the United States and Europe -- did not overlap with the purchases of Slim-Fast and Ben &amp; Jerry's. He declined to say whether the company planned further acquisitions.</p>
        <p>Antony Burgmans, the co-chairman, said today that the Bestfoods deal would ''accelerate the targets we set for ourselves'' in Unilever's growth plan.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 22, Unilever announced an ambitious $5 billion program to shed 25,000 jobs -- 10 percent of its global work force -- shut down 100 factories and focus its spending on the top 400 of its 1,600 brands, leaving the rest to fade away or be sold. The aim is to create annual savings of $1.5 billion by 2004 and to support both annual sales growth and margins, which have been lagging their major competitors in the United States and Europe. Up until then, the company -- like the food industry in general -- had shown only a lackluster performance. In the year up to February, Unilever's stock fell by 35 percent and 1999 sales of $44 billion were flat.</p>
        <p>Today, shares of Unilever rose 1.6 percent, or 7 pence to 444 pence ($6.75) on the London Stock Exchange, while in Amsterdam trading the stock fell 1.5 percent, to 53.05 euros ($50).</p>
        <p>By acquiring Bestfoods, Unilever is not only tapping into what is considered the best-managed American food company but it is also acquiring powerful brands like Hellman's mayonnaise and Knorr soups. That, Unilever contends, fits its strategic goal of pushing top names: with $2 billion in annual sales, Knorr will become Unilever's biggest food brand.</p>
