        <p>DURING the late 1950's and all through the 60's in the hit factories of Los Angeles, where rock 'n' roll history was being made, giants strode into the recording studios and ruled the baby boomers' airwaves.</p>
        <p>And whether the singer was macho or syrupy, soul or surf, and no matter how hot the tempo or how cool the intended audience, a small, blue-eyed, unassuming blonde, a silent professional in glasses, was usually laying down the bass line.

        <p>DURING the late 1950's and all through the 60's in the hit factories of Los Angeles, where rock 'n' roll history was being made, giants strode into the recording studios and ruled the baby boomers' airwaves.</p>
        <p>And whether the singer was macho or syrupy, soul or surf, and no matter how hot the tempo or how cool the intended audience, a small, blue-eyed, unassuming blonde, a silent professional in glasses, was usually laying down the bass line. Hunched down, getting in no one's way, supporting her children, her very presence often kept secret from the public by contract -- the teen idols' images must not be hurt -- she guzzled coffee and used her breaks to check her messages with an anonymous female voice like hers on the answering service.</p>
        <p>Oh, you prideful fans, you didn't know that a working mom played the electric bass for the Beach Boys, Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, the Righteous Brothers, Johnny Mathis, Nancy Sinatra, Lou Rawls, the Monkees, the Buckinghams, Sonny and Cher, Andy Williams, Quincy Jones, Joe Cocker, Mel Torme, the Four Tops, Bobby Darin, Frank Zappa, Wayne Newton, Herb Alpert, Al Martino and a zillion movie and television projects? Call up www.carolkaye.com and be ashamed.</p>
        <p>Carol Kaye is one of the most recorded musicians in history, with perhaps 10,000 sessions. But until the musicians' union changed things in 1973, she and other studio, or session, players did not even get their names on the records.</p>
        <p>''You're correct about the studio musicians being totally unknown out there,'' Ms. Kaye wrote in an e-mail message. (She answers up to 100 messages a day.) ''The great Brian Wilson is the FIRST to take steps to rectify that.'' (Interviews with Ms. Kaye were included when Mr. Wilson re-released the album ''Pet Sounds'' two years ago.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Kaye's Web site might have the last word. While waiting for a book by Russ Wapensky, which will match studio musicians with the recordings they played, fans can go online to read Ms. Kaye's reminiscences, her desire to set the record straight and her exquisitely detailed guitar and bass instructions. One can order her books and latest jazz recordings.</p>
        <p>One can also hear some dynamite bass lines. Sound bites include Ms. Kaye's parts in ''Good Vibrations,'' the ''Mission: Impossible'' theme, ''Bernadette'' and many more.</p>
