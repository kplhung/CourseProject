        <p>Representative Robert D. Franks held a slight lead early this morning over State Senator William L. Gormley in the race for the Republican nomination to run for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks declared victory shortly before 1 a.m., but Mr. Gormley refused to concede defeat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks entered the ballroom of the Kenilworth Inn here to the cheers of ''We want Bob.''</p>
        <p>''Good evening, New Jersey, I'm Bob Franks, the candidate with experience that money can't buy,'' Mr. Franks said. He said he would challenge his Democratic opponent, Jon S. Corzine, to debates in each of New Jersey's 21 counties.</p>
        <p>The Franks campaign also distributed packets to the news media detailing his schedule today for what it says will be the first day of his general election campaign.</p>
        <p>Unofficial returns in the four-man race showed that Mr. Franks had 35 percent of the vote and Mr. Gormley had 34 percent, with 98 percent of the precincts reporting, a difference of about 3,000 votes out of nearly 300,000 cast.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gormley appeared before his supporters in the ballroom of the Sheraton Atlantic City West Hotel early this morning with his wife, Virginia, but would not concede the race, saying there were still 100 precincts to be counted.</p>
        <p>''We're going to look at the numbers and wait till everything comes in,'' Mr. Gormley said. ''It's not my intention to needlessly prolong this process.''</p>
        <p>The crowd at the Sheraton had cheered an early lead held by their candidate, but as the race grew closer through Tuesday evening, they became more subdued and seemed to settle in for a long night.</p>
        <p>In the considerably more modest ballroom of the Kenilworth Inn, Mr. Franks's supporters took heart as their candidate closed the early gap, cheering when he had moved within two percentage points, when the race became a dead heat and again when he edged ahead.</p>
        <p>The other two candidates in the race, James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, and Murray Sabrin, a finance professor at Ramapo College, trailed far behind in the race.</p>
        <p>Shortly after 11 p.m. Tuesday, Mr. Treffinger conceded. ''No matter who is the nominee of my party, I vow my uncompromising support,'' Mr. Treffinger said. ''I will work tirelessly for a new conservatism which is inclusive, reformist and populist.''</p>
        <p>The outcome of the Republican primary has been difficult to handicap since last fall, when Gov. Christine Todd Whitman announced that she would not seek the nomination for the seat that was being vacated by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democrat.</p>
        <p>For one thing, all the candidates except Mr. Sabrin were moderate political insiders of decidedly ''pastel hues,'' said Steve Salmone, a Republican political consultant in the state who was not working for any of the candidates. None had bold or sharply etched profiles in state politics or could claim to be an outsider assaulting the establishment gates as Senator John McCain had done for a time in his party-rattling run for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>The Republicans also found that their race was being overshadowed by the fierce Democratic Senate race and its high level of spending. But that could turn into a blessing, said Judy Shaw, a lobbyist and former chief of staff to Governor Whitman; since there was little bitterness among Republican contenders, the candidates and their supporters should have an easier time rallying around the winner of the primary. It remains to be seen if the Democrats can reach such a rapprochement.</p>
        <p>So for the crowded Republican field, the undecided voters were considered important in Tuesday's voting. In the final week of campaigning, Mr. Franks and Mr. Gormley, casting themselves as the presumptive front-runners, had aimed their arguments at each other and then at Mr. Corzine. Both sought to underscore their political experience, in contrast to Mr. Corzine, a political neophyte and former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>At polling places around the state, many Republican voters said that the Democrats' race had drawn so much attention away from their own party's that even they were not very knowledgeable about the Republican candidates.</p>
        <p>Bill Kennedy of Vernon, Sussex County, said he had voted for Mr. Franks ''because he was going to win anyway,'' given his greater name recognition.</p>
        <p>Some voters, including Patricia Neil of Clinton Township and Bob Glauber of nearby Readington, towns in Hunterdon County, said they had voted for Mr. Gormley because he was a former marine.</p>
        <p>In the waning hours of the campaign, the four candidates took distinct approaches. For his part, Mr. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, made few public appearances, instead closeting himself with campaign strategists and reportedly plotting efforts to get out his core supporters on primary day. Mr. Salmone and others said the strategy did little to broaden Mr. Treffinger's base beyond the northern New Jersey counties or to heighten his profile in the south and central parts of the state where he is little known.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabrin, the former Libertarian, stressed his opposition to abortion and gun control in his final days of campaigning, an approach that many Republicans said kept him a marginal candidate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gormley depended largely on his television advertisements. In those ads, he attacked Mr. Franks, a member of the House Budget Committee, saying he was not a fiscal conservative and would endanger Social Security. Mr. Gormley also promoted his own moderate views in support of gun control.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, with less money for television ads, traveled the state in a McCain-style bus trip called ''Franks on a Roll,'' trying to excite the grass-roots Republican voters who know him from his service as state party chairman, a longtime member of the State Assembly and a four-term congressman.</p>
