        <p>SITUATED on the jagged coast of Finland nearly 400 miles north of Helsinki, this remote city must rank as one of the world's most improbable technology boomtowns.</p>
        <p>There is no daylight from December through mid-February. Parking lots provide electric warmers to keep car engines from freezing.</p>
        <p>Except for forests and lakes, there isn't much within 100 miles of Oulu. The most notable town to the north is Rovaniemi, which has built its economy on the assertion that it is the true home of Santa Claus. ''It is easy to come to Oulu,'' wrote Ilpo Okkonen, the author of a picture book about the city.  ''All you have to do is set out from somewhere else.''</p>
        <p>Yet as unlikely as it may seem, this town of 100,000 people is home to hundreds of electronics companies. Driven in part by Nokia, the Helsinki company that is the world's biggest manufacturer of mobile telephones, Oulu thrives as a center for research on wireless data communications.</p>
        <p>Nokia employs nearly 5,000 people here, most of them working on third-generation mobile services that offer high-speed electronic commerce and even full-color video communications.</p>
        <p>But the city has also become a hotbed for start-ups. There are companies here that make wireless networks for underground mines; wireless tickets for buses and ski lifts; wireless automation systems for factories; and wireless encryption systems to protect data sent over the airwaves.</p>
        <p>No one is quite sure how all this ''mobile commerce'' will develop, but the phenomenal success of ordinary mobile phones has attracted a flood of venture capital. Finnair now makes 15 daily round-trip flights between Oulu and Helsinki, and most are packed with business travelers.</p>
        <p>The city's half-dozen hotels are routinely booked solid, but rarely with tourists. A handful of American technology companies, like Tellabs and Mentor Graphics, have offices here as well.</p>
        <p>''Right now, all of us venture funds are loaded with money,'' said Juha Mikkola, a partner in Eqvitec Partners, a venture capital firm in Helsinki that has invested in several Oulu companies. ''All we need is more good entrepreneurs.''</p>
        <p>Until about 10 years ago, Oulu was best known as a former trading center for black tar. Those days are long gone: the demand for tar, used in waterproofing, collapsed with the demise of big wooden ships in the 19th century. (Local shops still honor the heritage by selling tar liquor and tar candy,  which taste about as good as they sound.)</p>
        <p>Much of the city's rebirth stems from its large pool of skilled technical people. The University of Oulu, financed mainly by the Finnish government, draws 13,000 students and has programs in electronics, engineering and information technology. Most of the students come from northern Finland, and about two-thirds stay in the area.</p>
        <p>The government also set up the Technical Research Center, which now employs about 2,900 researchers who work on advanced wireless technologies and optical electronics. About half of the center's revenue comes from work for private companies.</p>
        <p>In the early 1970's, long before the boom in cellular telephones, Nokia set up a small branch here. Then Nokia was a conglomerate that dabbled in a variety of electronics as it searched for new opportunities. Researchers in Oulu provided some of the company's early work in wireless military equipment for the Finnish government, which gave it a base for jumping into mobile telephones in the late 80's.</p>
        <p>Oulu's abundant technical talent has also made it a haven for local entrepreneurs. One was Lauri Kuokkanen, who was posted here by Nokia and then quit in 1976 to start LK Products, a company that made radio-frequency filters.</p>
        <p>A self-described ''serial entrepreneur,'' Mr. Kuokkanen went on to start at least three other companies, including a company called Solitra. The man he recruited to run Solitra, Juha Sipila, recently sold it to an American company called ADC, reaping tens of millions of dollars. Today, he is an investor in at least 15 other local start-ups.</p>
        <p>''People ask how Oulu suddenly became such a big success,'' said Mr. Kuokkanen, who is 68. ''We just did our daily work and it gradually grew bigger and bigger. It's been happening for the last 25 years.''</p>
        <p>Much of that work happens at Technopolis, an industrial park that is home to about 130 companies. Researchers and ideas shuttle between business and academia, much as Stanford University fueled the growth of Silicon Valley.</p>
        <p>''There is quite a strong internal network of people there who all studied in the same area about 20 years ago,'' said Vesa Sadeharju, a partner at SFK Finance, a venture capital firm in Helsinki that has invested in about 10 Oulu start-ups. Last month SFK was bought for an undisclosed amount by one of Europe's biggest venture capital firms, 3i Group, which is based in London.</p>
        <p>Companies based at Technopolis employ more than 10,000 people, but thousands more work off campus at companies like Sonera, Finland's biggest telephone company, and Polar Electro Oy, which makes electronic heart-measurement products.</p>
        <p>MANY are start-ups that rent as little as a single room but obtain access to high-speed phone lines, administrative services and expertise at the university and the Technical Research Center. CCC Oy, for example, a small company started in 1985, developed software under contract for Nokia and then developed its own products. Today, it has about $20 million a year in sales.</p>
        <p>Researchers are digging into more exotic areas as well. At the Wireless Internet Laboratory, part of the Technical Research Center, Petri Mahonen is experimenting with virtual-reality glasses that would allow mobile-phone users to browse the Internet in color.</p>
        <p>His team has also installed miniature wireless-computer servers into devices like coffeepots and toy race cars. ''The main idea is not that people want to run their coffeepots over the Internet,'' Mr. Mahonen said. ''The point here is to think about using the Internet for unusual new purposes and to see how small and how cheap you can produce a wireless Internet server. It turns out they can be quite small and cheap.''</p>
        <p>Compared with Silicon Valley, Oulu remains a rustic outpost. There are few shopping malls or movie complexes, and the streets are filled with creaky old cars. The city's main attraction is bicycle paths and footbridges, which crisscross the waterways and lakes.</p>
        <p>When spring arrives in mid-May, nights gradually disappear into a two-month-long stretch of daylight, and the region becomes a haven for outdoor sports and recreation. One evening early last month, in-line skaters and bicyclists stayed out until 11 while salmon fishermen drifted in the golden rays of the late-night sun. By July, people are playing midnight golf and tennis.</p>
        <p>''The other day, I left work at 3 p.m. and drove about 150 kilometers to go fishing,'' Pertti Huuskanen, the president of Technopolis, said last month.</p>
        <p>''I fished for several hours and I used my mobile telephone to read and answer my e-mail,'' he said. ''I got back by about 11:30, before it was completely dark.''</p>
