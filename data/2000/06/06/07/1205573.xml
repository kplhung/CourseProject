        <p>MANES-Max, died peacefully at his home in Manhattan, June 5, 2000, aged 94. Max was born in tsarist Poland and came to this country in 1923. He was a hatter for most of his adult life, and was an active union member, organizer and retiree, receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award from UNITE! in 1995. He struggled for social justice throughout his life, working for civil rights, for welfare rights, and against the war in Vietnam. Upon reaching the age of 65, he and his wife, Isabel, organized Seniors for Adequate Social Security (SASS), to defend Social Security and Medicare against cutbacks and privatization. From that time, despite failing hearing and eyesight, he was active in senior citizen and health care issues, working with the Congress of Senior Citizens and the New York Network for Action on Medicare, among others. In 1981 Max was a delegate to the White House Conference on Aging. In 1992 he received the Senior Citizen of the Year Award from Canaan Senior Service Center. He is survived by his children, Joan and Michael, his daughter-inlaw, Kieu Manes, his son-in-law, Wes Phillips, his grandson, Sean Manes, his brother, Sidney, and his sister, Ruth Duckstein. He was a fighter to the end.</p>
