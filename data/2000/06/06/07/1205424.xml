        <p>AS mango season heightens, chefs in New York are taking full advantage of the surfeit. Desserts are the obvious destination for sweet fruit, but mangoes also have such a complex, assertive flavor that they can hold their own next to chilies, herbs and other pungent ingredients.</p>

        <p>AS mango season heightens, chefs in New York are taking full advantage of the surfeit. Desserts are the obvious destination for sweet fruit, but mangoes also have such a complex, assertive flavor that they can hold their own next to chilies, herbs and other pungent ingredients.</p>
        <p>At Good in Greenwich Village, the chef/owner, Steven Picker, uses mangoes across his menu: in a spicy relish to accompany quesadillas, in a luscious riff on pineapple-upside down cake and in his fruit salad.</p>
        <p>Sue Torres, at Hell's Kitchen in Clinton, makes a mango-ancho chili aioli to serve as a dip with fried calamari. At Quilty's in SoHo, Katy Sparks makes a spicy mango radish salsa with grated fresh ginger and cilantro to serve with squab, though it would match well with any poultry.</p>
        <p>Farther uptown, Stephen Lyle of Village uses a similar range of flavors when he dresses a mango and arugula salad with a jalapeno-mint dressing  And at Montparnasse, a new Midtown bistro, Claude Chassagne adds chopped mango to salmon tartare that is studded with cubes of tart lemon confit. Bold pairings like that work even when the mangoes are in desserts. At Mercer Kitchen, the pastry chef, Patrick Coston, garnishes his tart-like mango pizzas with a chiffonade of basil. At Roy's New York, ripe mangoes and lemon grass are pureed to make an aromatic soup. And at Wild Blue, Michael Lomonaco even adds chili to his mango sundae, which layers mango sorbet with fresh mango, spicy macadamia brittle and tamarind sauce.</p>
        <p>When buying mangos, look for smooth, mostly unblemished fruits free of shriveling, mold or soft spots. You can't judge the ripeness by color alone. Buy mangos that smell fruity, and let them ripen at room temperature: when ready to eat, they'll be softly yielding to the touch. Once ripe, mangoes should be stored in the refrigerator.</p>
        <p>The neatest way to prepare the fruit is to ''hedgehog'' it. Slice the top and bottom halves off the fruit, getting as close to the flat seed as possible. Using a sharp knife, cut a crosshatch or tick-tack-toe pattern in the flesh of each half, but not through the skin. Holding the ends in your hands, press the skin with your thumbs to turn the slice inside out.  Diamond-shaped, bite-size chunks of fruit will pop up from the skin, ready to be scooped off with a spoon. With a knife, cut off any flesh that remains on the seed.</p>
        <p>RADISH AND MANGO SALSA  Adapted from Quilty's  Time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>2 ripe mangoes, peeled and cut into  1/4-inch dice  2 small bunches radishes, trimmed and thinly sliced  1 small red onion, finely diced  2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar  2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice  2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger  1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil  3 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro  Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.</p>
        <p>Combine all of the ingredients except the cilantro, salt and pepper in a glass or plastic bowl. Stir gently to combine. Just before serving, add  cilantro and season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>MANGO-PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE  Adapted from Good  Time: 1 hour 45 minutes</p>
        <p>For the topping:</p>
        <p>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</p>
        <p>1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar</p>
        <p>1 cup diced fresh mango</p>
        <p>1 cup diced fresh pineapple.</p>
        <p>For the cake:</p>
        <p>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened  1 cup packed dark brown sugar</p>
        <p>1/2 cup granulated sugar  3 large eggs</p>
        <p>1/3 cup sour cream  1 teaspoon vanilla  1 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour</p>
        <p>1/4 cup cornmeal  1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon  1 teaspoon ground ginger  1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1/4 cup finely chopped mango</p>
        <p>1/4 cup finely chopped pineapple.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter a 9-inch cake pan, and line with parchment or wax paper.</p>
        <p>2. To make topping, in a small saucepan, melt butter with brown sugar. Stir until smooth, and pour into cake pan; allow to cool slightly. Sprinkle mango and pineapple over, and set aside.</p>
        <p>3. To make cake, in bowl of electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat butter until light, about 3 minutes. Add brown and granulated sugars, and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, stopping and scraping down  sides of bowl after each addition.  Beat in sour cream and vanilla.</p>
        <p>4. Sift together flour, cornmeal, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder and  salt. On low speed, mix flour mixture into batter in three batches; gently fold in mango and pineapple. Pour  batter into the cake pan. Bake until  top is golden brown and a cake tester inserted into center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Invert onto a platter to serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
