        <p>Letter from Thom Kleiner, town supervisor of Orangetown, NY, deplores Gov George W Bush's evident disdain for knowledge and intellectualism (June 4 article)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>George W. Bush's evident disdain for knowledge and intellectualism (''Bush's Odd Pitch: Ignorance Is Bliss,'' Political Memo, June 4) is troubling. No one wants a president who speaks so loftily that he loses our attention. But the president has an obligation to promote knowledge and learning unambiguously.</p>
        <p>In 1970, President Nixon nominated Judge G. Harrold Carswell, considered an intellectual lightweight by many, for the Supreme Court. Senator Roman L. Hruska of Nebraska praised Mr. Carswell, saying: ''Even if he were mediocre, there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers. They are entitled to a little representation, aren't they?'' The Senate correctly rejected the effort to inject mediocrity into the nation's highest court.</p>
