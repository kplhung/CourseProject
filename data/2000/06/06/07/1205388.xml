        <p>WHEN a restaurant scene is as hectic and aggressive as New York's, there's a temptation for chefs to indulge in trading-floor tactics. If everyone around is shouting, it's a natural impulse to grab for attention by shouting louder. In culinary terms, that means freakier ingredients, strange flavor combinations and surroundings designed to keep the eye distracted.</p>
        <p>It takes nerve to place one's faith in the food and nothing but the food. But that's exactly what Alex Urena and Dan Barber, the chefs and owners of Blue Hill, have done. Blue Hill, named after a farm in the Berkshires that belongs to Mr. Barber's grandmother, could hardly be more unassuming.</p>

        <p>WHEN a restaurant scene is as hectic and aggressive as New York's, there's a temptation for chefs to indulge in trading-floor tactics. If everyone around is shouting, it's a natural impulse to grab for attention by shouting louder. In culinary terms, that means freakier ingredients, strange flavor combinations and surroundings designed to keep the eye distracted.</p>
        <p>It takes nerve to place one's faith in the food and nothing but the food. But that's exactly what Alex Urena and Dan Barber, the chefs and owners of Blue Hill, have done. Blue Hill, named after a farm in the Berkshires that belongs to Mr. Barber's grandmother, could hardly be more unassuming.</p>
        <p>A few steps below sidewalk level in an old Greenwich Village town house, Blue Hill almost shrinks from notice. There's a small bar near the entrance, a few tables up front, some exposed brick and a few more tables and banquettes in the back. The decor barely exists, just enough to give off a vaguely pleasant impression. The menu is small, with tiny print. Even the restaurant's logo, a scampering rabbit, suggests a certain modesty, or even timidity. Prices are astoundingly low.</p>
        <p>This quiet, adult setting admirably suits a style of cooking that is both inventive and highly assured. Mr. Barber and Mr. Urena spent time together as chefs at the old Bouley, and Mr. Urena went on to cook at El Bulli in Spain. Their schooling shows. By and large the food is refined without being fussy, harmoniously structured and deftly handled.</p>
        <p>There are dull spots on the menu, dishes that please but do not excite, which is a problem when there are only half a dozen appetizers and entrees. But the overall standard is high. High enough to make up for the excruciating banquette seating, where diners are pressed so close to one another that conversation becomes a survival exercise. You either come up with your own topic or become engulfed by the table talk next to you.</p>
        <p>Poached duck, an entree that deserves to be the restaurant's signature, shows the Blue Hill style to advantage. A skinned duck breast, poached in beurre blanc and duck stock, is paired with leg meat done as a confit, then crisped at the last minute and placed over pureed artichokes. The breast, although cooked through, retains a ruddy color and achieves an almost buttery tenderness. Like the leg, it gets textural contrast, from pieces of sauteed artichoke. The poaching technique is unexpected. So is the rich, complex flavor relationship of duck and artichoke.</p>
        <p>Blue Hill's very abbreviated menu manages to pull off a few more surprises, like the bright-red ''ravioli'' that accompanied a chunk of braised cod one evening. The item in question turned out to be a thin wrapper of marinated beet stuffed with meat from the cod tail. It has since wandered off the menu, and for the moment, at least, a mushroom tart accompanies the cod. Less successful, but certainly an eyebrow raiser, is poached foie gras accompanied by smoked eel and apples, one of those dishes that seem like the culinary equivalent of an imaginary meeting between disparate world figures like Einstein, Picasso and Mother Teresa.</p>
        <p>Two dishes that left me cold on an early visit underwent revision and emerged triumphant. Ceviche of bass, dotted with bits of grapefruit and scattered with striking purple beet shoots and pepper cress, now shows a perfect balance of acid, salt and sweet, with a little heat from a mustard-oil vinaigrette. Another appetizer, a well-seared piece of skate, swam into strange waters early on, when it was paired with an enormous shrimp raviolo coated in a peculiar almond sauce. The raviolo remains, although it has been downsized, and it gets favorable treatment from an incisive, pungent green garlic sauce. Asparagus soup is adequate but, given the dishes surrounding it, seems like a wallflower, even with a jazzy accent of Parmesan foam.</p>
        <p>The bravura duck makes it difficult for competitors on the entree list, but the very simple hanger steak, surrounded by chewy spinach spaetzle and deliciously sweet little spring turnips, has nothing to be ashamed of, and salmon, cooked at a temperature so low that it barely breaks a sweat, could be seen as the piscine answer to the duck, an exercise in melt-in-your-mouth tenderness. The fish gets brilliant support from a fragrant pistou of spring vegetables.</p>
        <p>Two of the four desserts are puddings. They are also clearly the best in this little pack, miles ahead of the rather dull crema catalana, which does not really earn its sweet-bitter blood-orange stew, and an off-putting strawberry and rhubarb soup.</p>
        <p>Chocolate bread pudding, a sizable cube of brioche, undergoes a miraculous transformation after marinating overnight in a loose chocolate ganache. Chocolate and bread interfuse to form a new compound, chocolate silk. It is a conversation-stopper.</p>
        <p>The innocent-looking rice pudding, flavored with vanilla bean, breaks out of the warm and fuzzy comfort-food category, thanks to a topping of passion-fruit foam that has an almost steely acidity. Unsuspecting taste buds prepare for creamy blandness, and suddenly -- zap! -- are hit with an electric jolt.</p>
        <p>Blue Hill can be sneaky that way. Low-key and recessive, it lulls you into expecting the usual. And then it pounces.</p>
