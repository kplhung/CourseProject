        <p>By measuring the distances to 100,000 galaxies scattered across billions of light-years of space, a robotic telescope in eastern Australia has produced the first detailed, large-scale map of the region of the universe inhabited by Earth and its own galaxy, the Milky Way.</p>
        <p>The map revealed galaxies glittering like bonfires in majestic arcs and filigree patterns hundreds of millions of light-years across, as well as vast dark regions called voids, and it confirmed a fundamental assumption about the birth of the universe: that cosmic structures have a maximum size, a limit called the ''end of greatness.''</p>
        <p>These structures, giant agglomerations of galaxies, might be thought of as cosmic ''continents.'' Previous surveys have never been large enough to see more than a few continents, leaving open the possibility that larger maps would uncover still larger structures. But the new survey, by covering a much larger area, has confirmed that the larger structures do not exist.</p>
        <p>The map is being presented this week at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Rochester  by researchers from universities in Australia, Britain and the United States. The project is called the 2-Degree Field Galaxy Red Shift Survey, or 2dF.</p>
        <p>''We're able to look at the whole range of scales -- everything from the continents on the larger scale right down to high-resolution images of individual mountain peaks,'' or smaller clumps of galaxies, said Dr. Matthew Colless, a 2dF member at the Australian National University.</p>
        <p>The map indicated that there were no structures larger than the ones found in the survey, Dr. Colless said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Carlos Frenk, a 2dF member at the University of Durham in Britain, said the findings seemed to confirm many of the theories of origin, which say that the universe should be smooth on an extremely large scale, a legacy of the nearly featureless soup of elementary particles from which the universe is thought to have emerged in a colossal explosion called the Big Bang.</p>
        <p>At the same, the survey found, as expected, that beneath the image of the smooth surface, the universe is punctuated on a smaller scale by the bumpiness of individual galaxies, clusters and superclusters, Dr. Frenk said.</p>
        <p>If the map had shown ever larger and larger continents, he said, ''we would have to throw everything we know about the universe into the dustbin.''</p>
        <p>The structures in the map also resembled those that have emerged from computer simulations of how gravity, operating over billions of years, gave the universe its form, by pulling together fluctuations in the particles to create filigree patterns.</p>
        <p>''These colossal structures formed by just the same laws of gravity that make the Moon go round the Earth,'' said Dr. John Peacock, a 2dF member at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.</p>
        <p>The resemblance to the computer simulations, performed earlier by an international team called the Virgo Consortium at computing centers at Edinburgh and the Max Planck Society in Germany, ''in itself is a great triumph,'' Dr. Peacock said.</p>
        <p>Scientists are able to use the computers to change cosmic parameters like the overall density of matter in the universe when running the simulations, creating slightly different structures in each case.</p>
        <p>By making the structures as similar as possible to the new 2dF data, Virgo members, including Dr. Frenk, can gain some understanding of the density of the real universe. So far, the comparisons point to a universe with a relatively low matter density, as other astronomical measurements have suggested.</p>
        <p>There are also some puzzling discrepancies, mostly on small scales, between the simulated universe and the 2dF map, perhaps indicating that cosmologists do not yet understand how individual galaxies form.</p>
        <p>''They're not identical,'' Dr. Frenk said, but the discrepancies should not challenge the theories of the origin of the universe.</p>
        <p>Dr. John Huchra of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who was among the first astronomers to see huge structures in the universe, said the 2dF map was ''going to answer a lot of the questions about large-scale structures.''</p>
        <p>And Dr. Joshua Frieman, an astrophysicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, said that the ''end of greatness'' -- a term originally coined by Dr. Robert Kirshner of Harvard-Smithsonian -- was clear in the data.</p>
        <p>The existence of a largest size of structure had been hinted at in earlier surveys, but those structures ''were as large as the survey volume,'' Dr. Frieman said. ''You clearly don't see that in this picture.''</p>
        <p>Galaxies like the Milky Way and those found in the 2dF survey are thought to form in dense regions of much larger mass called dark matter. The dark matter is also thought to have been created in the Big Bang, and scientists believe it is made up of elementary particles that feel gravity but otherwise interact only weakly.</p>
        <p>Most physicists believe that the dark matter particles have not yet been detected directly, although some experiments to find it have reported suggestive results.</p>
        <p>The 2dF survey maps the galaxies, and thereby the underlying dark matter, using the 12-foot-wide Anglo-Australian Telescope near Coonabarabran, Australia.</p>
        <p>The project uses a computer-controlled robot to position fiber optics inside the telescope, in order to collect the light from hundreds of galaxies at once and analyze the spectrum of their light simultaneously in a single image of the sky. Then the telescope gazes at another part of the sky and collects hundreds more spectra.</p>
        <p>A galaxy's distance can be deduced from its spectrum, said Dr. Karl Glazebrook, a 2dF member at Johns Hopkins University, because in an expanding universe, the more distant a galaxy is, the faster it is being carried away from our own, and the more its light appears to shift to the red end of the spectrum -- an effect that can be measured and is known as the red shift.</p>
        <p>And from the distances and positions of the galaxies, astronomers can create a map.</p>
        <p>''It's like standing in one spot and measuring distances to everything you can see around you, and not being able to go there,'' Dr. Glazebrook said.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the 2dF team will have collected 250,000 galaxies, he said. Later, an even larger project, called the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, will collect about 100 million celestial objects, including about a million galaxies for a similar map, but extending to much larger distances.</p>
