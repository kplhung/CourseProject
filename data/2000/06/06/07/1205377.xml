        <p>EVERYONE'S a cousin in e-commerce.</p>
        <p>Scan a week's worth of dot-com headlines, and chances are good that you will find at least a dozen, if not scores, of partnership agreements or corporate alliances between Internet companies or traditional companies doing business on the Web.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the partnerships involve industry behemoths, like Sun Microsystems and Netscape. Most other times, they are more modest, as in the recent alliance between Phone.com, a provider of wireless Internet technology, and MyWay.com, which builds custom business portals.</p>
        <p>Taken as a whole, however, e-commerce partnership announcements have come so often recently that they have become the white noise of Internet business, the hum of the industry's hard drive.</p>
        <p>Analysts and e-commerce executives say that alliances are far more prevalent in the Internet industry than in the off-line world, for cultural, practical and technical reasons. The opportunity for publicity also plays a role. ''Some of these are really good,'' said Steven Johnson, a partner with Andersen Consulting, ''but some are just companies breathing their own exhaust -- more hype than reality.''</p>
        <p>Consumer sites have been among the most aggressive in their partnership efforts, analysts say, because they are under pressure to broaden the products they offer. Amazon.com, for instance, has joined Drugstore.com, Ashford.com and, more recently, Wineshopper.com to sell as wide a variety of goods on its site as possible.</p>
        <p>With these partnerships, sites achieve two critical e-commerce objectives: first, they increase the chances of shoppers' spending more on each order; second, they prevent customers from straying to other retailers. And portal sites join with companies that provide bill payment or group buying technologies to give users more reasons to stay  -- ''stickiness,'' in industry terms.</p>
        <p>But stickiness is only part of the story. Industry analysts say that 20 years ago, companies were more inclined to build their own divisions or buy other companies. ''In the 70's and 80's, people bought into diversification,'' said William Battino, who heads the e-business division of PricewaterhouseCoopers. ''Now they don't want to be the jack-of-all-trades.''</p>
        <p>That notion is particularly relevant within the context of Internet business, Mr. Battino and others say, because Web start-ups often spring from a shred of technology or involve a marketplace niche that simply cannot serve customers without plugging in pieces of other businesses.</p>
        <p>''With partnerships,'' Mr. Battino said, ''it makes your speed to evolve and radically reinvent much higher,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In an industry where an idea can turn into an initial public offering in months, and where first-mover advantage is the holy grail, Internet executives say that stopping to develop expertise in any given area is  tantamount to suicide.</p>
        <p>''In a crowd of start-ups, no one can do everything,'' said Cornelius Willis, vice president for marketing at QPass, which allows shoppers to buy lower-priced goods on several Web sites and have the purchases put on one bill. ''So companies like mine are trying to string together a value proposition by creating a coalition of value.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Willis said that QPass recently made an alliance with American Express, whereby American Express customers would be able to redeem their awards points or shop at Web sites that use the QPass payment system. ''We don't have that Amex customer list of 27 million people,'' Mr. Willis said. ''And they don't have the partnerships with digital publishers and others that we have. It makes sense for everyone.''</p>
        <p>While such a loosely woven corporate structure may at first appear too feeble to sustain a business over the long haul, executives predict it will become a mainstay of the new economy.</p>
        <p>''This won't slow down,'' said Warren V. Musser, the chief executive of Safeguard Scientifics Inc., an incubator of Internet companies. ''Collaboration makes things work. There's no one group that can have all the perspective, so the trick is to collaborate, to make sure you don't miss anything.''</p>
        <p>Another reason why partnerships, especially among technology-savvy companies, are so plentiful is that ''the new information technologies allow for better coordination between firms,'' said Charles Conn, the chairman of Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch Inc., which sells tickets and has more than 40 city sites.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conn said that in the past, companies like ITT, the conglomerate, ''just acquired everything because it was difficult to coordinate partnerships through the phone'' or other means. ''But now we can communicate fluidly,'' he said, ''even with companies that have a completely different structure.''</p>
        <p>Small Internet companies, he added, are also much happier to pursue partnerships  because that allows them to maintain a small workforce ''where people can feel the impact of their labor, and frankly feel their impact on the company's stock price.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Conn said that Internet companies also choose partnerships over deeper equity relationships because of the uncertain nature of the industry. ''When you look at a firm you might want to own, but they have a cash burn rate that's very high,'' he said, ''you might make less than a controlling investment to get a seat on the board, and get some insight from the company without having to consolidate their losses.''</p>
        <p>For instance, he said, Ticketmaster Online recently formed a partnership with Active.com, which helps users find sporting events they can participate in, rather than buy the company. ''They're still losing a significant amount of money, so it wouldn't make sense to own them now,'' Mr. Conn said. ''But this way, we still develop a strong relationship with them.''</p>
        <p>ONE way to track the Internet's infatuation with alliances is to watch the fad du jour within e-commerce. When business-to-consumer e-commerce held the public's -- and Wall Street's -- attention, the pace of alliances matched the investor frenzy. When the focus shifted to the business-to-business category, partnerships involving online industry marketplaces and software providers proliferated.</p>
        <p>Lately, wireless e-commerce, sometimes referred to as ''m-commerce'' (the m stands for mobile), is emerging as another battlefront; for wireless providers, that means it is time to find partners. Kathy Simpson, the director of developer marketing for Phone.com, said the company had created alliances with about 200 companies who wanted to put their Web content into a format that could be viewed by people with cellular phones and other hand-held devices.</p>
        <p>Phone.com earns money by signing up large long-distance carriers like AT&amp;T to offer the service to cellular customers, so it behooves Phone.com to get as many Internet companies as possible to develop wireless versions of their sites. Meanwhile, these companies have little time to devote to wireless technology -- particularly because many are scrambling to remain in business -- so they rely on Phone.com to help.</p>
        <p>When asked how Phone.com helps such a vast list of partners develop wireless programs, Ms. Simpson laughed. ''We have other partners to help with that,'' she said. ''None of us can exist alone. It's like people are supplying various pieces of the puzzle.''</p>
        <p>E-commerce executives said that in cobbling together that puzzle, not every piece fit nicely, especially when the partnerships are thrown together for the publicity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conn, of Ticketmaster Online, said that he had seen that happen. ''We've been fortunate with our own alliances,'' he said. ''But it's absolutely true that many of the ones you read about are ill-thought-through, and are done for the P.R. value. If there's one great thing about alliances, though, it's that they can be undone quickly.''</p>
