        <p>Pathmark Stores, the supermarket retailer that has been among the few chains willing to expand its presence in New York's low-income neighborhoods, has announced tentative restructuring plans that would avoid layoffs and continue normal operations during reorganization, company officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Pathmark, based in Carteret, N.J., said on Friday that it had reached an agreement on a restructuring with an ad hoc committee of bondholders who hold about 46 percent of the company's outstanding bonds.</p>
        <p>Officials at Pathmark, a subsidiary of Supermarkets General Holdings Corporation, said they plan to file a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization plan. Bondholders are scheduled to complete voting on the plan by June 27, officials said.</p>
        <p>Upon reorganization, the bondholders would receive all of the newly issued Pathmark stock, officials said. The reorganization is not expected to lead to layoffs or affect plans to build new stores. Pathmark is seeking approval to build a supermarket at West 145th Street and Bradhurst Avenue in Harlem.</p>
        <p>Sales for the first quarter of this year were up 2.8 percent, to $919.2 million. But Pathmark reported losing $21.2 million in the first quarter, more than double its net loss of $9.2 million during the same period a year ago, because of debt payments.</p>
        <p>The company is nearly $2.5 billion in debt and is scheduled to make a $116 million payment this year. Last year, a deal between Pathmark and Royal Ahold, a Dutch food retailer, fell apart after the Federal Trade Commission signaled that it would face trouble from regulators.</p>
