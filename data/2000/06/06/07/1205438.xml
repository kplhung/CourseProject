        <p>BOSNIA: MUSLIM QUITTING -- Alija Izetbegovic, who led the Bosnian Muslims toward a negotiated victory against Serbian and Croatian efforts to partition Bosnia, said he would retire in October, two years ahead of time. Mr. Izetbegovic, 74, is the chairman of the three-member presidency, including a Bosnian Serb and a Bosnian Croat, that heads the Bosnian Federation. Mr. Izetbegovic cited his age and health as the main reasons for stepping down.</p>

        <p>KOSOVO: PRESS CRACKDOWN -- In a contentious campaign to curb growing violence against the Serb minority, the head of the United Nations mission in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, announced the drafting of ''emergency legislation'' to restrain so-called hate speech in the Albanian-language media. For the first time, Mr. Kouchner called violence against the Serbs ''organized,'' and said the restraints, sharply criticized as heavy-handed by the Albanian media, would be temporary.</p>

        <p>KOSOVO: ATTACK ON SERBS -- A grenade was thrown into Serbs at an outdoor market in the protected, mostly Serbian enclave of Gracanica, wounding at least five people. Three more Serbs were wounded by British soldiers who feared an attack on their commander, Gen. Richard Shirreff, who tried to calm the crowd. Serbs stopped cars driven by Albanians, setting five cars on fire and injuring two drivers. The local Serb National Council said the grenade blast was the latest example of ''organized Albanian terrorist groups seeking to expel Serbs from Kosovo.''</p>

        <p>MONTENEGRO: PRESIDENT'S BROTHER HELD -- The younger brother of President Milo Djukanovic has been arrested on suspicion of involvement in an attack that seriously hurt an opposition politician from a party that wants faster moves toward independence. Aco Djukanovic, 35, and another man were held on charges that they pistol-whipped Zoran Klajic, of the Liberal Alliance, after exchanging insults. Important local elections will be held in Montenegro on Sunday.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: FROM I.R.A TO MAYOR -- Cathal Crumley, 41, a former Irish Republican Army member jailed in the 1980's on murder conspiracy convictions that were later overturned, has become the first mayor of a Northern Ireland city from Sinn Fein, the political party of the I.R.A. Mr. Crumley was selected by a vote of the councilors in Londonderry.</p>

        <p>HUNGARY: NEW PRESIDENT -- Ferenc Madl was elected president in a divisive parliamentary vote that went to three rounds, even though he was unopposed. Mr. Madl, 69, will replace Arpad Goncz in August. The ballot underscored the tensions between the former ruling Socialists and the center-right coalition, analysts said. Although major parties had agreed on Mr. Madl, he failed to win a required two-thirds majority. He was elected in a third round, when a simple majority sufficed.</p>

        <p>CANADA: CHINESE TEENS LOST -- Canada has lost track of about 30 teenage Chinese who arrived without passports last summer at the coast of British Columbia. Most are believed to have gone to the United States. The province's Children and Families Ministry made the youth survey after seven adult Chinese illegal immigrants escaped from jail and were recaptured. The ministry said it was responsible for caring for the teenagers, not for detaining them.</p>

        <p>NAMIBIA: CONDEMNED OVER ANGOLA -- After all but ignoring the practice for months, the government has denounced citizens who signed on as soldiers with Angola, calling their actions a crime, according to the local press. Namibia, which has sent its own army to fight in the civil war alongside Angolan forces, is raising its objections as disgruntled fighters demand their government pay them after Angola apparently failed to.</p>

        <p>NIGERIA: PRICE PROTESTS -- Nigerian workers blocked streets in Lagos and barricaded access roads to the presidency and Parliament in the capital, Abuja, as protests over an increase in gasoline prices spread. Riots erupted again in Abeoukuta, north of Lagos and the hometown of President Olusegun Obasanjo, left, the police said. Mr. Obasanjo approved the price rises, saying subsidies were costing $2 billion a year.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: FOREIGN CENSORING ENDED -- The government has stopped requiring that foreign correspondents filing from Sri Lanka submit articles to a censor for approval. Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said he hoped that censorship of Sri Lankan journalists would also be eased in July. Censorship was imposed last month as fighting raged between government troops and separatist Tamil rebels.</p>

        <p>JAPAN: CULTIST'S LIFE TERM -- A former doomsday cult leader was sentenced to life in prison for the 1995 gas attack on the Tokyo subways that killed 12 people. Yoshihiro Inoue, 30, was one of five Aum Shinri Kyo agents accused of being involved in the attack. Prosecutors had sought the death penalty.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: VERIFYING PULLOUT -- The Foreign Ministry said it expected the United Nations to verify by today that Israel had fully withdrawn from Lebanon after the conclusion of a United Nations mission delineating a provisional boundary. Terje Larsen, a special United Nations envoy, presented the findings to Beirut. Lebanon and Israel lodged ''minor'' objections to the withdrawal line, Mr. Larsen noted. But the agreement is still expected to be accepted, opening the way for a United Nations peacekeeping force to deploy in southern Lebanon, diplomats said.</p>

        <p>Correction:  June 8, 2000, Thursday  A report in the World Briefing column yesterday about the retirement of Alija Izetbegovic next October misstated his position. He is one of the three presidents of Bosnia and Herzegovina, not president of the country's Muslim-Croatian component, the Bosnian Federation.</p>
