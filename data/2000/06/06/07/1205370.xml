        <p>THERE are many people who like speed, noise and power, who appreciate the serious engineering under the hood in the ''funny car'' events in drag racing and monster-truck rallies, who thrill to the whine of the turbines and flaming exhaust and the occasional guy-stuff explosions. But even among these power fans, Mark Nye and his home-built jet engines form a subculture.</p>
        <p>Nye Thermodynamics (www.gas -turbines.com) provides an online look at  awesome displays of engineering nerve, including:</p>
        <p>*The Hornet: a hot-air-blowing device that can be used for snow removal or for melting ice on the railroad. (Mr. Nye lives in Mississauga, Ontario, where keeping the tracks ice-free is a concern.) The Hornet looks a little like a green vacuum cleaner and produces 300 pounds of thrust at full power.</p>
        <p>*A series of homemade gas turbines, one of which resembles a securely bolted giant hair dryer with a white-hot flame. You can listen online to this baby starting up. (Hold on to the headphones; you may want to remove them quickly.)</p>
        <p>*The NT-5 turbojet, his most ambitious motor, which uses a truck turbocharger. It is a work in progress that Mr. Nye's site depicts in detail.</p>
        <p>Most of the language on the site is strictly for mechanics, but there are arresting asides, like, ''There was a huge EXPLOSION and the exhaust nozzle went flying backwards off the tailpipe.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nye's regular business is designing and manufacturing attachments for heavy equipment, illustrated on www.nye.on.ca. Nye Thermodynamics is his sideline.</p>
        <p>His jets can be built in any basic welding shop. ''I built my first one just to see if it would work,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''It took less than five hours using only the junk I had lying around.''</p>
        <p>Actually, building them is not dangerous, he said; it's only running them, without the proper precautions and protective equipment, that poses hazards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nye, who was born in Mississauga in 1952, wrote: ''I have a wife and three kids. I am a bit of a geek and love science, electronics and all things technical.'' Asked about his goals, he said: ''To continue to be successful in the custom attachments business. And to have fun with jets as time permits. Also, to have some really rich guy think my stuff is so neat that he gives me millions of dollars to fund further development.''</p>
