        <p>A series of cute promotions running on television recently shows various members of the Dallas Stars celebrating over the past year with the Stanley Cup that they won last spring. One features Joe Nieuwendyk using its bowl for a Jell-O mold. Another depicts Ed Belfour taking the bowl for a spin on an amusement park ride. A third has Brett Hull and Mike Modano trying to pick the lock on a car door to get to the trophy stuck inside.</p>
        <p>When they travel from Dallas to New Jersey Wednesday for Thursday's Game 5 of the championship round, the Stars might want to pack the cup carefully and bring it all cleaned up, without dents and easily accessible. Because they trail the Devils by three games to one, they could be handing it over as soon as Thursday in Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>If not then, it might happen back in Dallas after Game 6 on Saturday. If not then, it should occur in the Meadowlands after Game 7 next Monday. Because it is hard to imagine the Stars winning three consecutive games after the way they collapsed in the third period Monday night, when the speedier, stronger, more confident Devils scored three consecutive goals for a 3-1 victory.</p>
        <p>''We have cracked,'' said Ken Hitchcock, their coach.</p>
        <p>Let's hope they don't crack the trophy or any more Devils' skulls. Monday's conclusion was marred by Derian Hatcher's gratuitous chop to the chops of Jason Arnott, the Devils' best forward. Hatcher used both hands and he was holding his stick.</p>
        <p>The cheap shot knocked out a dental bridge and left Arnott semiconscious. Hatcher said yesterday: ''I still don't even think I hit him that hard. I must have hit him perfect. He was leaning forward. The timing was a little off. I came up with my hand a little bit. Maybe some of it was frustration.'' When someone asked Hatcher if the Stars were in shock at their predicament, he answered: ''Ah-ha. Yeah!''</p>
        <p>Assuming the Devils win the cup, what will they do with it on their individual days of possession? John Madden, the rookie, acknowledged that family and friends are already asking. Perhaps Madden, who scored the winning goal while killing a penalty Monday, can take the trophy to his old housing project in Toronto or to his old college campus at Michigan. ''Look!'' he can say. ''See what an undrafted player can do with dedication and belief in himself?''</p>
        <p>Vladimir Malakhov, Alexander Mogilny and Sergei Brylin, who created the Devils' first goal Monday, can join Sergei Nemchinov and take the cup to Red Square in Moscow for a vodka toast. Petr Sykora, Patrik Elias and Bobby Holik can take it to Prague and compare its gleam to that which shines from Olympic gold medals and all those other awards Czech hockey players win all the time.</p>
        <p>Scott Stevens, an Ontario man, can take it to the Hall of Fame in Toronto, and he can bring along the Conn Smythe trophy he is likely to win as the most valuable player of the tournament. Stevens can tell the guard at the door: ''No, I don't have a Norris trophy for best defenseman. But will these credentials help me get inducted?''</p>
        <p>Claude Lemieux and Martin Brodeur can take it back home to Quebec and tell their pals, ''Mes amis, you don't see this thing around here much anymore. But if you read the base, you can see the names of The Rocket and The Flower and Le Gros Bill and -- Look! There's Larry Robinson again, this time as a coach.'' And Lemieux can take the trophy to 30 general managers this summer and tell them, ''I'm a free agent and I always seem to find this silver thing wherever I play.''</p>
        <p>Scott Gomez, the 20-year-old rookie from Alaska, and Ken Daneyko, the 36-year-old veteran from Alberta, can pour iced tea in and sip because Gomez is not old enough to drink alcohol and Daneyko has learned the hard lessons of such beverages. Arnott can take it across the Hudson to Glen Sather's office at Madison Square Garden so the new Rangers general manager can reflect on all those times his old Oilers raised it. And Arnott can thank Sather for trading him from the Oilers to the Devils.</p>
        <p>And Brian Rafalski, Scott Niedermayer, Colin White, Randy McKay, Jay Pandolfo, Brad Bombardir, Steve Brule, Steve Kelly and Chris Terreri will get their day, too, and their names inscribed in silver.</p>
        <p>Gomez, referring to the possibility of winning the tournament, said, ''I still feel like it is a so-far-away kind of thing.'' Madden, referring to Gomez's apparent calm, said, ''Either he has ice running through his veins or he just doesn't know any better.'' Rafalski, another rookie who scored Monday, reflected on the defending champion Stars and said, ''It's our job to push them over the cliff.''</p>
        <p>Modano, the Dallas star, was asked what this moment on a different precipice must be like for the Devils. ''When you are one win away, that is the most unbelievable feeling in your career, knowing that you are that close to what we are all playing for and have grown up to do,'' he said. Modano paused, seemingly to find words for the emotion inside him. ''It's a great feeling,'' he said, softly.</p>
