        <p>Re ''3 Dead Marines and a Secret of Wartime Okinawa'' (news article, June 1), about the widespread rape of Okinawan women by American servicemen in World War II:</p>
        <p>I served with the 81st Seabees during the invasion of the island, and when the island had been secured, our battalion was assigned a large group of Okinawan civilian men and women, who worked for us. I was responsible for seeing that they were supervised, fed and guarded. Our men had been instructed that there was to be no maltreatment of the Okinawans and that no physical contact of any kind was allowed. Furthermore, we had been warned that any sexual contact with the Okinawans would result in a 10-year sentence on the island.</p>

        <p>There may have been instances of rape, but I can only speak for our outfit in saying we treated the Okinawans with respect and never harmed them.</p>
