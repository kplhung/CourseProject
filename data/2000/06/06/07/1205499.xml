        <p>In his first policy speech since he officially began his run for the United States Senate, Representative Rick A.

        <p>Appearing before the New York State Conference of Mayors and Municipal Officials, which was holding its annual conference at a hotel here, Mr. Lazio told the roughly 200 mayors, council members and other municipal officials of varying political affiliations about his legislative record as a congressman and listed some of his qualifications for the Senate.</p>

        <p>In his first policy speech since he officially began his run for the United States Senate, Representative Rick A. Lazio said at a conference of mayors today that he would continue to back federally supported housing and community development programs but offered no new proposals of his own.</p>
        <p>Appearing before the New York State Conference of Mayors and Municipal Officials, which was holding its annual conference at a hotel here, Mr. Lazio told the roughly 200 mayors, council members and other municipal officials of varying political affiliations about his legislative record as a congressman and listed some of his qualifications for the Senate.</p>
        <p>He delivered mostly crowd favorites on the need to direct federal dollars -- in concert with private financing -- to help improve to downtown areas and housing for the elderly and the poor.</p>
        <p>Here and there, while playing up his own legislative achievements, such as leading a bipartisan effort to remake the public housing system, Mr. Lazio worked in subtle digs at Democrats, but did not mention his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton. (Though later, speaking to reporters, he criticized her temperament and rationale for seeking public office in New York.)</p>
        <p>''A while ago, I read in the paper some comments of our housing secretary, who was quoted as saying, 'People just don't care about housing,' '' Mr. Lazio said, referring to Andrew M. Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development, who is a leading New York supporter of Mrs. Clinton. ''I beg to differ with that assessment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio then said his philosophy for housing and economic development includes partnerships between the private sector and the government to finance and manage programs.</p>
        <p>He promised to oppose any reduction in the Community Development Block Grant program, which provides local communities financing for homegrown projects. The government, he said, should allow more flexibility with the money, too. And Mr. Lazio vowed support for federal programs that help first-time homebuyers and help the homeless move into permanent housing.</p>
        <p>''Housing is one of the most fundamental needs of our people,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''It is critically important to have access to health care. It is essential to have a job that allows you to pay your bills and to take care of your family. But at the end of the day, if you don't have a roof over your head -- to organize your life, to speak with your children, to plan for the future -- it is almost impossible to march forward and to make progress.''</p>
        <p>The speech hewed to Mr. Lazio's early campaign strategy, as outlined by his aides, in at least two respects. It focused on social issues more often aligned with Democrats and offered few specifics.</p>
        <p>David Egner, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said Mr. Lazio overstated Republicans' support for housing. ''Republicans wanted to eliminate HUD entirely, stop housing production, sell the Federal Housing Administration and kick the poor out of public housing,'' Mr. Egner said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Among those at the conference, reaction to Mr. Lazio's speech was mixed, reflecting what one organizer said was the makeup of the audience, roughly evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. Some Democrats noted that Mr. Lazio made no new proposals of his own.</p>
        <p>But Republicans, and a few Democrats, said Mr. Lazio carried himself well and smartly showed empathy for their perennial headaches in finding ways to shore up downtowns and build affordable housing.</p>
        <p>''He would like to give back to municipalities the revenue that goes to Washington,'' said Leonard Curcio, a Republican who is the mayor of Washingtonville. ''He is very pro-housing, and that's what we need.''</p>
