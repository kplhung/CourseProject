        <p>PICK a movie, any movie -- not one with Julia Roberts but something out of the mainstream that you know you would have one chance in a thousand of finding in the average video store. Something like ''The Cranes Are Flying,'' Mikhail Kalatozov's acclaimed 1957 film about tangled love in wartime Russia. Or choose anything old or foreign, or obscure or rare -- D. W. Griffith's ''Female of the Species'' with Mary Pickford and Lillian Gish, ''The Communist Weapon of Allure'' or the western ''Rio Rattler.''</p>
        <p>On foot or horseback, it would take hours to scour video stores to buy such items. On the Web, the hunt could be over in minutes.</p>

        <p>PICK a movie, any movie -- not one with Julia Roberts but something out of the mainstream that you know you would have one chance in a thousand of finding in the average video store. Something like ''The Cranes Are Flying,'' Mikhail Kalatozov's acclaimed 1957 film about tangled love in wartime Russia. Or choose anything old or foreign, or obscure or rare -- D. W. Griffith's ''Female of the Species'' with Mary Pickford and Lillian Gish, ''The Communist Weapon of Allure'' or the western ''Rio Rattler.''</p>
        <p>On foot or horseback, it would take hours to scour video stores to buy such items. On the Web, the hunt could be over in minutes.</p>
        <p>You will usually need a half-dozen places to look. Take ''Cranes'' as an example. Many buyers would go straight to Amazon.com, the 800-pound gorilla of online video sales. Amazon carries 100,000 video titles and, according to a report by Alexander &amp; Associates, a Manhattan consulting firm that follows the industry, accounted for almost 50 percent of online video sales in the last quarter of 1999. The site also includes an auction of rare and hard-to-find videos.</p>
        <p>Amazon is linked to the immense Internet Movie Data Base, www.imdb.com, which does not sell videos directly but is an annotated index of 230,000 films from around the world, a total that rises by the hour. On the database there is a complete description of ''The Cranes Are Flying.'' In keeping with the interactive nature of many video sites on the Web, the database lets movie fans write reviews. Robert De Saint-Loup of Balbec, France, writes, ''In its subsuming of vast social, national and world events to a love affair, it is essentially no different from a conventional Hollywood movie.''</p>
        <p>Next to the ''Cranes'' entry is a box that links the user to Amazon.com, but a balloon states that the movie is not available from Amazon. So the search continues.</p>
        <p>The second-largest site in terms of revenue, Familywonder.com (11.3 percent of the Web video market), is basically for children and their parents, not the likeliest source for ''Cranes,'' though it does offer foreign films, in addition to animated, live-action and horror productions, among others.</p>
        <p>The third-largest site, Reel.com, a general, all-service source that is owned by Hollywood Video, the nation's second-largest chain after Blockbuster, doesn't have the movie. Nor does Blockbuster.com.</p>
        <p>The fourth-largest site, the online auction house eBay (5.5 percent of the market), had 1,874 foreign films up for bids recently, but ''Cranes'' wasn't among them. (But you could have bid on a ''rare'' edition of Pedro Almodovar's ''Matador,'' which stood at $25 with 9 days and 12 hours left on the block.)</p>
        <p>The fifth-largest site, Bigstar.com, whose home page says it has 80,000 titles, listed ''Cranes'' and gave some particulars but it, too, did not have the film.</p>
        <p>In fact, ''Cranes'' was available from two well-known sites. The site for Movies Unlimited, www.moviesunlimited.com, had the tape for $47.49, down from $49.99. At Facets International, www.facets.org, ''Cranes'' was listed at $29.95. Of the sites checked, only these two had the film; several others noted for deep collections, including www.kimsvideo.com, an arm of the famous New York video store, and Tlavideo.com, which belongs to the Philadelphia-based chain and mail-order company, did not.</p>
        <p>Movies Unlimited, also in Philadelphia, and Facets International, in Chicago, publish catalogs of 40,000 to 45,000 titles, sprinkled with tapes even seasoned videophiles have hardly heard of. They have huge inventories of foreign and art house movies, along with large and eclectic collections in every genre, from cult and horror to silent film, American independents, all kinds of retro television and the performing and fine arts. Facets has an extensive collection of foreign cinema.</p>
        <p>Both sites look for the unusual, often title by title. ''We make an effort to track down the stuff,'' said Irv Slifkin of Movies Unlimited. ''We deal with hundreds of independents and small companies. Often we deal with one person who owns the rights.'' At that moment he was pleased at listing ''Incubus,'' the 1965 horror film directed by Leslie Stevens and featuring William Shatner speaking Esperanto.</p>
        <p>Even Facets didn't have that one. But Amazon did. ''Our price: $34.95,'' the entry read. As the largest site, Amazon attracts videos from all quarters, including hundreds of tapes from fledgling independent movie makers offered in Amazon Advantage, a special section on the site.</p>
        <p>Like Facets, Movies Unlimited and most other sites, Amazon quickly leads clients to related titles. Customers who bought ''Incubus'' at Amazon, the site said, also bought ''Blood Feast'' (1963), ''Macbeth'' (1978) and ''Black Sunday'' (1960) on DVD. Four similar titles were suggested by Facets.org,  including ''The Devil's Nightmare'' (1971), Jean Brismee's ''slice of demented Belgian-Italian sleaze.''</p>
        <p>DVD buyers may need an extra push to start browsing. ''DVD households tend to be more tech savvy, so it's more of a planned purchase,'' said Greg Durkin, Alexander &amp; Associates' video research director. ''People go to Reel or Amazon and type in the title. It's the same with books and music.''</p>
        <p>From that, retailers hope, something else catches the eye of customers, leading to the impulse purchase. Studios spend a lot on banner ads, ever flashing and changing. Buyers looking up one title spot others. ''They say, 'Why don't I just go ahead and buy it if it's discounted that much?' '' Mr. Durkin said.</p>
        <p>And how much is that? Prices vary widely and often deceptively online. At the end of 1999, Amazon had an average price of $24.97; Familywonder.com, $12.83; Reel .com, $15.23; eBay, $20.32; and Bigstar.com, $12.25.</p>
        <p>Sites regularly trumpet savings of ''30 to 40 percent.'' A young market, video e-commerce accounted for only 2.2 percent of overall cassette sales and 9.6 percent of DVD sales in the fourth quarter of 1999. Players jockeying for market share often  lower prices drastically.</p>
        <p>But for new mainstream titles, shoppers are often better off buying at the video store. If price is the main consideration, shop around various sites but remember: the average price paid for a video on the Web, according to Alexander &amp; Associates, was $19.25 at the end of last year, compared with $14.25 in stores. Thank shipping and handling.</p>
        <p>Industry analysts say that cutting prices below cost will thin out video e-commerce and that many sites will fail or be consolidated. ''Video and DVD are low-margin commodity products,'' said Carrie Johnson, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
        <p>Amazon will only get bigger, Ms. Johnson said. So, too, in all likelihood, will sites related to the big store chains and solidly established mail-order operations like Facets, Movies Unlimited and TLA.</p>
        <p>And don't worry about the movies; there will always be plenty. ''Imagine Shatner in Esperanto,'' Mr. Slifkin said.</p>
