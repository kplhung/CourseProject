        <p>THINK of the Internet. The imagery that comes to mind is romantic and exciting: dot-com billionaires barely out of school and colorful Web sites offering all sorts of wares and intriguing ways to shop. What definitely does not come to mind are Sherrell Coppedge and Kara Sylvia, seated recently at two ordinary desktop computers in a plain, windowless room at Honeywell Inc.</p>
        <p>For eight weeks, four hours a day, Ms. Coppedge and Ms. Sylvia have been trying to trip up the new Internet ordering system that Honeywell's consumer products group, based here, is installing. Soon 2,000 customers -- auto dealers, parts distributors, lube centers, retail chains -- will be logging on to Web sites to place orders for Autolite spark plugs, Fram oil filters and Prestone antifreeze. No more orders by telephone or by fax, and much less paperwork. But first, the speedy new system has to function.</p>
        <p>Working from thick loose-leaf notebooks, Ms. Coppedge, 34, and Ms. Sylvia, 26, carefully type in complicated, quirky orders, each a probe for shortcomings in the system's software. When a flaw appears, Jon Nehlsen, a 25-year-old Internet specialist, takes charge of the fix. All three are salaried employees earning less than six figures, the two women much less. None of the windfalls from wildly lucrative dot-com stock offerings come their way. And yet they and thousands like them are laboriously making the Internet a backbone of the national economy.</p>
        <p>The Internet, with its endless Web sites, is already a miraculous storehouse of information, an instant communicator, a new medium, a vast electronic shopping mall, a link to Wall Street. But for all the excitement over the prospect of an Internet connection in every home, this is not where the big money is. What companies spend buying and selling goods and services to one another dwarfs consumer spending. The score last year was $14 trillion to $3 trillion. Like Honeywell, brick-and-mortar companies are just beginning to shift these intercompany sales to the Internet. Until they make the full transition, the Internet age will not truly have arrived.</p>
        <p>And it is slow in coming. A lot more is involved than just logging on. Honeywell's consumer products group, for example, has three disparate, aging computer systems that track 17 factories and more than $1 billion in annual sales. Getting those computers to talk to other companies through the Internet is not easy. When Ms. Coppedge and Ms. Sylvia -- simulating outsiders -- hit a trouble spot, it is often because one of their orders placed through a Web site failed to enter the company's internal computers. Some version of Honeywell's painful progress is popping up everywhere in corporate America.</p>
        <p>''The lion's share of American companies are in the throes of this conversion,'' said Clyde R. Moore, chief executive of the Thomas &amp; Betts Corporation in Memphis, which makes electrical switches and connectors. A multi-million computer investment is just being completed. The more sophisticated system updates the company's inventories more quickly than before, for example, thus reducing the risk of selling a connector over the Internet that is not in stock.</p>
        <p>Web sites for consumers are easier to create, and many companies now have them. They put these sites on computers dedicated to the Internet. A car buff, for example, can pull up a Honeywell site and find the filter he needs to change the oil in his car himself. Punch in a ZIP code and the site lists the nearest retail outlets selling the filter -- along with maps and directions on how to get there. The entire database is maintained separately from Honeywell's internal computer system.</p>
        <p>The consumer is clearly the hare in this race. Still, the tortoise, even in this difficult early stage, has already moved out front. Intercompany transactions over the Internet totaled $90 billion last year, a drop in the bucket given the potential but nevertheless more than five times the $16.7 billion that consumers spent over the Internet, according to the Gartner Group, a consulting firm that tracks such data. The $16.7 billion included brokerage fees to trade stocks online.</p>
        <p>But what route the tortoise will take to the finish line is still unclear. Business-to-business commerce over the Internet means that companies will have access to the data in one another's computers, like access to a stranger's bedroom. ''What the Internet does is make the boundaries between companies much more fuzzy,'' said Paul Osterman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. With boundaries fading, mergers, and challenges to antitrust law, may multiply.</p>
        <p>The Internet is also giving fresh impetus to trends already well under way. American companies, for example, find that the Internet gives them easier access to suppliers overseas. Competitive Internet auctions are forcing suppliers, here and abroad, to cut prices more than in the past. And stockpiles of unsold goods -- a burden in hard times -- are likely to shrink; the Internet helps companies place smaller orders more frequently.</p>
        <p>There is one unambiguous benefit: labor productivity. The Internet should make possible more output, or at least the same output, from fewer hours of work. The 28 employees in Honeywell's consumer products group who now take orders by fax and phone will eventually be reassigned, their tasks automated as corporate customers shift to ordering online -- 2,000 this year and the remaining 2,000 thereafter. Some of the 28 might be reassigned as traveling sales reps to sign up more customers. Business would then grow without having to hire more workers, another gain in labor output.</p>
        <p>''The potential exists for the nation to achieve real productivity gains,'' said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist.  The gains are just beginning to kick in, Mr. Blinder noted, as business-to-business commerce over the Internet -- almost nonexistent in 1997 -- finally takes hold and spreads.</p>
        <p>More noticeably, the incipient Internet age is breeding a new type of electronic marketplace. Beyond one company selling goods or services to another, companies in the same industry are offering their products jointly on a common Web site, inviting buyers to choose from among their joint offerings. A new marketplace, to sell plywood or chemicals or steel or accounting services, is announced almost weekly. Honeywell's avionics division is participating in one, to sell aircraft parts and repair services. The main customers are airlines and the owners of corporate jets.</p>
        <p>Buyers are also setting up joint marketplaces, the best known being one announced earlier this year by General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler. Most of the $240 billion a year in parts and materials that the Big Three purchase to make vehicles are to be listed on common Web sites, and thousands of suppliers will bid online for the business, almost certainly pushing down their prices.</p>
        <p>There is a catch, however. Lacking expertise, the brick-and-mortar companies are relying on outside contractors to design and maintain their electronic marketplaces. Often the contractors are young, profitless dot-coms scrambling for a permanent foothold. Whether they will share in the control of these marketplaces, and the revenue they generate, or simply collect fees as technical agents is anyone's guess.</p>
        <p>Honeywell, for example, took the lead in setting up the marketplace for aircraft parts and repair services but offered shares to the United Technologies Corporation, another big maker of aircraft parts. ''To attract the likes of United Technologies, we had to be willing to share ownership,'' said Michael R. Bonsignore, Honeywell's chief executive. The necessary expertise in Internet technology -- to set up and run the marketplace -- comes from a start-up, i2 Technology, which also has an ownership  stake but not much leverage. It lacks any  merchandise to sell on the exchange.</p>
        <p>Still, a few dot-coms are trying to mimic the New York Stock Exchange, which owns and runs the principal trading house for corporate stocks. FreeMarkets Inc. in Pittsburgh is in hot pursuit of this goal. Big manufacturers like Emerson Electric, Honeywell and United Technologies now turn regularly to FreeMarkets to round up suppliers, who then bid against one another on auction-style Web sites set up by FreeMarkets.</p>
        <p>''Our FreeMarkets is going to be a major node, and we are now a major business-to-business marketplace,'' said Glen Meakem, the 35-year-old founder and chief executive, whose four-year-old company, for all its success, is losing money. ''We are too far along for that to be taken away from us.''</p>
        <p>The Inventory Revolution  Making What's Needed Only When It's Needed</p>
        <p>From the early days of the Industrial Revolution, business has struggled with the problem of unwanted inventories, which are the stockpiling of goods that later cannot be sold. Computers have helped to keep inventories in check, and now business-to-business commerce over the Internet offers corporate America, particularly manufacturers, a new and perhaps powerful tool in this struggle. That is because the Internet is turning out to be the least expensive system developed, so far, in which companies can talk to one another through their computers.</p>
        <p>But to hold down inventories, the hookup has to go in two directions: to customers at one end, as Honeywell's consumer products group is doing with its new order system, and to suppliers at the other end. Then when one of Honeywell's customers -- the Jiffy Lube chain, for example -- orders a thousand oil filters, the suppliers at the other end will instantly know this and begin to make the metal casings, filter elements and tops, shipping them to Honeywell factories for final assembly.</p>
        <p>The broad goal is to manufacture only what is needed, when it is needed. In good economic times, companies everywhere have tended to overproduce and stockpile, fearful -- for lack of timely information -- that they could not meet a flood of orders. These are good times, and Honeywell still has ''$3.5 billion in working capital tied up in inventory,'' Mr. Bonsignore said.</p>
        <p>Stockpiles, although smaller than in the past, are still a shadow over the economy. When slowdowns inevitably arrive, production is cut back abruptly, exacerbating the hard times until inventories are reduced. The great hope is that production swings in the Internet age will be less abrupt.</p>
        <p>But the Internet hookups that link customers to their suppliers are still in their infancy. Only a few companies have completed the process: I.B.M., for example, and Wal-Mart. A decade ago, before the Internet, Wal-Mart connected the cash registers in its stores to its thousands of suppliers so that a shirt sold in Omaha registered with the company that made it in South Carolina. That pioneering system, however, required a huge investment in special computers and dedicated phone lines. Few other companies matched Wal-Mart's achievement, and in 1998 Wal-Mart itself switched its network entirely to the less expensive, more flexible Internet.</p>
        <p>Most American companies are more like Honeywell than Wal-Mart. Honeywell's consumer products group is only now about to go online with its order system for business customers, and its avionics group in Olathe, Kan., only recently hooked into the computers at Cessna, a big customer for the cockpit controls and navigational devices that Honeywell makes.</p>
        <p>Far more quickly than in the past, Honeywell is now privy to Cessna's shifting production schedule -- not only how many planes Cessna will make in the months ahead, but also how many of each model and their delivery dates. ''Honeywell takes this data, runs it through its computers and explodes it down to parts numbers for its suppliers,'' said David Oppenheim, Cessna's supply chain manager and chief of its e-business.</p>
        <p>Not quite. The explosion down to Honeywell's suppliers has not happened yet. But it will soon, the company promises. Links through the Internet to 12 of its 800 suppliers are about to go live. In a conference room at the avionics group's headquarters in Olathe, Jeffrey C. Small, manager of supply chain infrastructure, recently demonstrated the new system, flashing Web sites from his laptop on to a big white screen.</p>
        <p>''Every day when a supplier logs on, he will see his situation with us,'' Mr. Small said, displaying a dummy supplier Web site filled with hyphenated parts numbers, new and old orders, parts needed quickly, others needed not so quickly. ''It has taken 18 months to develop this system and it seems like it has taken forever.''</p>
        <p>The Global Auction Block  From Sealed Bids To Online Competition</p>
        <p>More visible is the Internet auction house operated by FreeMarkets. The auctions are a novelty even for a technology full of novelties. Suppliers worldwide bid over Web sites on their laptop computers. Giant mother versions of these Web sites, several feet high, cover most of a wall at FreeMarkets' headquarters in Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>As the bidding proceeds from the laptops, the numbers change on the mother Web sites, which have bluish backgrounds that glow in a slightly darkened room the size and shape of a small college lecture hall. As the auction proceeds, sometimes for three hours, young people (average age 31) counsel the bidders by telephone. They have designed the Web sites to call attention to the big justification for Internet auctions.</p>
        <p>One prominent column of numbers tells the big corporate buyer how much money the company is saving from the last time it bought this particular item. More often than not, that last purchase was pre-Internet style, through sealed bids. Opening these envelopes, the buyer then chose the lowest one. In the Internet auction, the competing suppliers see one another's bids. And if the falling numbers are not prod enough to keep shaving bids, separate graphs on the glowing Web sites plot the action downward.</p>
        <p>Honeywell's avionics group, in this new world, saved $400,000, or 19.5 percent, in the purchase last month of various parts for $1.7 million. Owens Corning bought $24 million worth of corrugated packaging through an online auction, saving 7 percent. And the Carrier Corporation saved 16 percent on the purchase of air-conditioner motors, mostly from Asian suppliers for the company's Asian factories.</p>
        <p>Carrier's parent, United Technologies, has bought a stake in FreeMarkets, which has frequently issued new stock to raise much needed capital. That may help to explain the enthusiasm of Edward Williams, Carrier's vice president for purchasing. ''We spend $3 billion a year on suppliers, and we are running $100 million of this through FreeMarkets,'' he said. ''I would like to keep that number growing.''</p>
        <p>What is less talked about are two changes in American business practices that the Internet auctions encourage. One is the tendency to ignore long-term relationships with suppliers and award the business to the  qualified bidder offering the lowest price, or to the long-term supplier if it cuts its bid. Japanese companies had favored long-term relationships with suppliers, without forcing them to discount, and in the 1980's, when corporate Japan seemed so successful, American companies went that way, too. Now the pendulum is swinging back, thanks in part to the Internet.</p>
        <p>''Japanese companies tried to partner a lot,'' Mr. Meakem of FreeMarkets said, ''and the Asian crisis proved that noneconomic cozy relationships don't work.''</p>
        <p>The other change is the new encouragement to seek less expensive suppliers overseas, a trend well under way before the Internet. The Internet makes worldwide bidding feasible and dramatic, although the recruiting of overseas suppliers remains a rather old-fashioned task. Half of FreeMarkets' 497 employees spend their time not running electronic auctions but searching for suppliers in trade-association directories and trips abroad, painstakingly building up a huge database of potential bidders.</p>
        <p>In preparation for last month's auction, Honeywell's avionics group received from FreeMarkets a list of 600 possible bidders from this database. By auction day, the list had been trimmed to 22 that met Honeywell's standards, some from as far away as Israel and China. That was still far more than the three or four suppliers that traditionally mailed in sealed bids.</p>
        <p>''There was no reason why we could not have recruited many more suppliers in the past if we had made the effort,'' said Doug McCambridge, e-business project manager at Honeywell's avionics group. ''The Internet is now pushing us to make the effort.''</p>
        <p>Small Changes Start to Add Up</p>
        <p>THE Internet, with its easy accessibility, is generating various small corporate efficiencies.</p>
        <p>The Chubb Corporation, the big insurer, for example, provides workers' compensation insurance to multinational corporations at their sites worldwide. Before the Internet, the executives in charge of workers' compensation at Chubb's client corporations gathered information about accidents by telephone, fax, e-mail, even floppy disks mailed to the home office.</p>
        <p>Reports from Chubb's claims adjusters arrived by similar routes. With the data finally entered in a central computer, the executives could pinpoint the most frequent types of accidents, where they occurred most often and other trends that, if reversed, might reduce accidents and thus the company's insurance premiums. Now Web sites set up by Chubb provide all this information more quickly, in greater detail and with new analytical tools for spotting trends.</p>
        <p>''What we are doing is leveraging a public infrastructure just as truckers leverage public highways,'' said Doug Nordstrom, Chubb's manager of business technology planning. ''And our customers are demanding that we use the Internet to give them information in real time. If you don't give it, you are at a disadvantage. Someone else will and take away the business.''</p>
        <p>Johnson Controls Inc. in Milwaukee, which makes temperature controls and other products, uses Web sites to help its field representatives repair controls installed in commercial buildings nationwide.</p>
        <p>The field representative logs on to a company Web site and ''accesses our huge database until he finds a similar problem and solution,'' said James H. Keyes, chairman of Johnson Controls. There is much less need for costly experts at the other end of a phone line to answer a representative's questions, Mr. Keyes added, ''and the repair job is faster.''</p>
