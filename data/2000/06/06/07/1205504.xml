        <p>Bob Arum, one of the most powerful promoters in boxing, ended a second day of combative and sometimes amusing testimony in United States District Court in New Jersey today, providing more details of the corruption in his sport and sparring with a defense attorney during his cross-examination.</p>
        <p>Little came out in Arum's testimony that had not already been made public in affidavits filed in a civil suit that accompanies the government's criminal prosecution of top officials at the International Boxing Federation on bribery and extortion charges.</p>
        <p>But Arum described in greater detail today the $100,000 he says he paid through a middleman to the founder of the I.B.F., Robert Lee Sr., in early 1995. The government is trying to prove that Lee extorted the money from Arum in return for approving a lucrative fight between George Foreman and Axel Schulz in April 1995.</p>
        <p>For the first time, Arum also revealed that he is not testifying under a grant of immunity from prosecution. He said he had volunteered information to prosecutors and had agreed to testify ''because I thought it was time to do what I could to end the corruption in boxing.''</p>
        <p>''He is testifying at his own risk,'' the lead prosecutor, Jose Sierra, said after the court adjourned.</p>
        <p>Over the last two days, Arum has said that Lee demanded $500,000 to approve the Schulz-Foreman fight at a meeting in New York at the Mayfair Hotel in December 1994. That meeting took place just a few weeks after Foreman, then 45, surprised the world by knocking out a much younger Michael Moorer in 10 rounds and taking the I.B.F. heavyweight belt.</p>
        <p>Under I.B.F. rules, Moorer had a right to a rematch, but Arum and Foreman preferred first to fight Schulz, a German, and they needed Lee's approval to make it a title fight.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Arum, who owns Top Rank Inc., testified that he reached a deal with Lee to pay $100,000 before the fight and $100,000 afterward in return for the I.B.F.'s blessing.</p>
        <p>He testified today that he paid the first $100,000 in two parts through a middleman, Stanley Hoffman, but that he never paid the second $100,000.</p>
        <p>The jury was not allowed to hear Arum's reason for this decision. In an interview outside court, Arum said he had pulled out of the deal after he learned the I.B.F. had also demanded that Foreman hire a consultant named Butch Lewis for $250,000 before Lee would approve the fight. Arum said he saw the move as another extortion scheme.</p>
        <p>But United States District Judge John W. Bissell ruled that Arum could not testify about the alleged extortion of Foreman, because he had no direct knowledge of it.</p>
        <p>The trial, now in its seventh week, is expected to last two more months. Lee and his son, Robert Lee Jr., 38, are charged with conspiracy, racketeering, fraud and tax evasion. A court-appointed monitor is overseeing the I.B.F.</p>
        <p>During cross-examination, Lee's lawyer, Gerald Krovatin, tried to undermine Arum's credibility, citing passages from his grand jury testimony and old correspondence that seemed to contradict some of Arum's statements.</p>
        <p>Krovatin also chipped away at Arum's story, forcing him to admit he did not know if Hoffman, the middleman, had ever delivered the $100,000 to Lee. Arum also acknowledged that he had paid Hoffman tens of thousands of dollars over the years for various services; the questioning appeared to lay the groundwork for arguing that the payments to Hoffman had nothing to do with the I.B.F.</p>
        <p>Krovatin suggested that Arum had been feuding with Lee for years over fees, often refusing to pay them until he needed something in return.</p>
        <p>But Arum feinted and bobbed, saying he did not remember financial details of the fights Krovatin brought up, and repeating that the fighter, not the promoter, pays the fee.</p>
        <p>''It's not something that comes out of the promoter,'' Arum said. ''It's the fighters that are subject to these exactions.''</p>
        <p>Krovatin asked what Arum meant by ''exactions,'' since the sanctioning bodies provide championship belts to fighters.</p>
        <p>''A $200 belt with a $400,000 to $500,000 sanctioning fee,'' Arum shot back, rolling his eyes at the jury. ''That's a real trade-off.''</p>
        <p>The jurors broke into laughter.</p>
