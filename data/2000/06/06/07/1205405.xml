        <p>Two days after ''The Wild Party'' was shut out at the Tony awards, the show's producers said they would close the musical after Sunday's matinee. Produced by the Joseph Papp Public Theater and a consortium of high-profile Broadway producers, the show will have lost approximately $5.5 million.</p>
        <p>The musical, composed by Michael John LaChiusa, with a book by Mr. LaChiusa and George C. Wolfe, was nominated for seven Tony awards but failed to win any at the ceremony. The awards were widely seen as the show's last opportunity to boost sagging sales.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfe, the musical's director and the artistic director of the Public, said yesterday he was still holding out hope that a last-minute surge in sales might save the show, but acknowledged that such a development was unlikely.</p>
        <p>''We're hoping a miracle happens, because I think this is an important piece of theater with a brilliant cast,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''The Wild Party,'' based on a 1928 poem by Joseph Moncure March about a group of decadent bohemians at play in Jazz Age New York, featured Toni Collette, Mandy Patinkin and Eartha Kitt, all of whom were nominated for Tony awards.</p>
        <p>The musical, which opened to mixed reviews in early April, was another high-profile gamble for the Public, opening as it did on Broadway, rather than at the theater's smaller East Village home. The show came on the heels of the poorly received revival of ''On the Town,'' also produced by the Public and directed by Mr. Wolfe, which lost some $6 million during a brief run on Broadway in late 1998.</p>
        <p>Unlike ''On the Town,'' however, which the Public produced alone, the production costs of ''The Wild Party'' were shared by several major Broadway investors, including Roger Berlind, Scott Rudin and Elizabeth Williams and Anita Waxman.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Lerer, the chairman of the theater's board of directors, said that, Broadway gossip aside, the closing of ''Wild Party'' would have no effect on Mr. Wolfe's status as artistic director of the Public.</p>
        <p>''George is a brilliant creative force and a brilliant director,'' Mr. Lerer said. ''There have never been any discussions on any level regarding his future at this institution.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Wolfe said he and his cast were proud of their work.</p>
        <p>''We consider it a victory,'' he said. ''Because it's the type of work that the Public Theater should be doing.''</p>
