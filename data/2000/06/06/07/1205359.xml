        <p>FOR many dot-coms, a public relations agency able to attract the attention of reporters who cover the Internet has been as important a business tool as an eye-catching Web address or a venture capitalist with deep pockets.</p>
        <p>The demand for spin doctors skilled in cutting through the clutter on the desks of journalists who help determine what's hot in cyberspace -- and what's not -- has boomed.</p>
        <p>''To the benefit of the public relations industry, the dot-coms would come to us first to build their brands, tell their stories, prove their worth and then go public,'' said Renee Edelman, executive vice president at PR 21, a New York agency spun off from Edelman Public Relations Worldwide that specializes in technology, new media and health care clients.</p>
        <p>''There was almost a frenzy in the way they went about it,'' Ms. Edelman said, ''a panic, really, about doing it quickly. About half my time was spent on new business; anyone who'd call, we'd rush out to see.''</p>
        <p>That eagerness, even anxiety, helped lift revenue in the public relations industry to levels undreamed of in the days when press agents pulled stunts to generate coverage. The demand for the services of public relations agencies led to a shortage of employees so acute that employers routinely offered bounties up to $5,000 -- after taxes, in some particularly lucrative instances -- to staff members whose recruitment recommendations led to hirings.</p>
        <p>But just as advertising agencies are rethinking their reliance on dot-com clients after the recent drop in the fortunes of many Internet marketers, many shops that specialize in public relations and corporate communications are reassessing whether the days of whining modems will last -- and wondering what to do if they don't.</p>
        <p>''There is already a slowdown happening,'' said Susan Butenhoff, president and chief executive at Access Communications in San Francisco, which counts among its clients companies like Corbis, Inktomi, Sega and Toysrus.com.</p>
        <p>''The dot-coms had a fruit fly mentality, and I mean that in the most loving way,'' Ms. Butenhoff added. ''They felt they had to get in fast or they wouldn't realize their valuation. So they believed they needed P.R. people only to get them through their I.P.O.'s.''</p>
        <p>''But the slowdown can be good,'' she said, ''if it forces dot-com people to become more realistic about the components of true business success.</p>
        <p>''Instead of changing their minds every day about who they are,'' she added, ''they're realistically assessing what they do, who their competitors are, what their commitment level is to marketing, what their distribution plans are.''</p>
        <p>Peter Himler, a managing director at Burson-Marsteller in New York, the public relations division of Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. that represents more than 150 Internet-related clients, echoed Ms. Butenhoff.</p>
        <p>''The Internet is here forever,'' said Mr. Himler, whose agency works for companies like Hotjobs.com, Northern Light Technology and Mvp.com, ''but there's going to be a shake-out among dot-com clients and a high attrition rate in relationships.''</p>
        <p>''More and more, P.R. agencies will understand the need to be selective,'' he added, ''because you will fail if you take every dot-com that wants to hire you.''</p>
        <p>Executives at several agencies said they were already moving to protect themselves from such a dot-com shake-out.</p>
        <p>''We're not judging accounts just by size but also by their potential, whether a client can build and sustain a long-term relationship with us,'' said Raymond Kotcher, senior partner and president of Ketchum in New York, the public relations agency owned by the Omnicom Group.</p>
        <p>''And we're considering very different compensation models,'' he added. ''We're looking at equity as part of the mix, and we're setting up relationships with venture capital firms, representing firms that provide a flow of business for us as they incubate new companies.''</p>
        <p>Peter B. Summerville, vice president for public relations in the Internet, e-commerce and health technology practices at Imagio, an advertising and public relations agency in Seattle, said: ''The smart agencies working in technology have already been rating their clients. It saves a lot of headaches.''</p>
        <p>''We grade prospective clients in five areas, including management experience, vision and respect for the marketing function,'' said Mr. Summerville, whose agency's clients include Microsoft and Real Networks.</p>
        <p>''If companies score lots of points, we aggressively go after them,'' he said. ''If the score falls in a gray area, we explore it further. And if they don't score high, we kindly suggest talking to other folks.''</p>
        <p>Many agencies are asking potential dot-com clients for cash up front, typically payments equal to 60 days' worth of fees.</p>
        <p>''We're asking all clients for two months' expected fees in advance,'' Ms. Butenhoff said. ''It filters out the people not prepared to spend what's needed to get attention in this noisy market.</p>
        <p>''And we ask for a business plan,'' she added. ''It's shocking how many don't have one.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Edelman said PR 21 had a requirement that dot-coms pay 60 days in advance, ''but now we're enforcing it much more than we had before because all of a sudden people are saying: 'I can't pay my bills. I'm selling out. I'm going out of business.'</p>
        <p>''We all realized a lot of these companies were risky, but wanted to take them on because they were fun, creative, filled with lots of energy,'' she said. ''You learn.''</p>
