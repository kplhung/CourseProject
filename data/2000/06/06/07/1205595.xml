        <p>If the Pistons never recapture their glory days, it will not be for lack of effort. Not with Joe Dumars running the show.</p>
        <p>In one of a series of moves yesterday, the Pistons appointed Dumars, a former star guard, as president of basketball operations.</p>
        <p>In other moves to strengthen their front office, the Pistons brought back Brendan Suhr to be director of player personnel and signed George Irvine to coach the team.</p>
        <p>Dumars, who played for Detroit for 14 seasons, including the Bad Boys era when the Pistons won consecutive titles, will relinquish his duties as director of player personnel to become president of basketball operations.</p>
        <p>Irvine, 52, who guided the Pistons to a 14-10 record as interim coach after Alvin Gentry was fired last March, was signed for three years.</p>
        <p>Suhr, a top assistant to the former coach Chuck Daly during the championship years, will take over as director of player personnel.</p>
        <p>Rick Sund, Dumars's mentor during the past year, retains his basic role as general manager while relinquishing his basketball operations chores to Dumars.</p>
        <p>Tom Wilson, who was the team's president, will continue to oversee business operations.</p>
        <p>N.B.A. OFFICE: Stu Jackson, the National Basketball Association's senior vice president for basketball operations, will assume the duties previously held by Rod Thorn as head of the basketball operations department on July 1.</p>
        <p>Thorn left the league last week to become president of the Nets.</p>
        <p>Jackson, will chair the league's competition and rules committee, oversee officiating and impose discipline for misconduct by players and coaches.</p>
