        <p>THEY looked like buoys -- piled up for sale, neighbors to bunches of litchi nuts. A sign stated they were young coconuts.</p>
        <p>An Asian man, with a calm expression and sweat on his brow, stood close by, looking up and down Canal Street.</p>
        <p>When a friend and I asked for one of the white top-shaped buoys, a large cleaver emerged in his right hand.</p>
        <p>In several violent, precise blows, he chopped off the top of the coconut just down to the meat. He then took a plastic straw and poked it through this small white circle of flesh.</p>
        <p>In a matter of seconds, our treat was prepared and delivered.</p>
        <p>It was indeed a coconut, but coconut in a new light: a silky, revitalizing tonic, scented with coconut, conveniently packaged like fast food. In the Caribbean it's called sky juice, and I can think of no better name.</p>
        <p>We handed over $1.50 and began fighting over sips of the sweet, fragrant liquid.</p>
        <p>The coconut is so young that its husk is white and soft, its meat barely formed. But the liquid is there and there is plenty of it, though it lasts only about a block, as the trash can on the corner, overflowing with empty coconuts, indicated.</p>
        <p>In the sun that day, it seemed somehow cooling, thin and pure like mountain air. It made the juice from a mature coconut seem oily and dull by comparison.</p>
        <p>The juice bars, which go on squeezing and pinching the essence from hard, resistant fruits, can wait. These generous, easily tapped coconuts are in season through August.</p>
        <p>They come from Thailand and can be found at fruit stands throughout Chinatown, especially along Canal Street. Prices range from $1 to $1.50 each.</p>
