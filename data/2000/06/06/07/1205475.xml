        <p>GREETINGS, fans, from sunny Los Angeles, California, center of the basketball universe, now that I, Phil Jackson, have spared David Stern a change of planes in Seattle and saved his league from the lowest-rated finals since the Lakers of Minneapolis and Mikan.</p>
        <p>The last time we communed in this particular space, I was holed up in Woodstock, legs crossed, caressing my whiskers, feigning interest in the New Jersey job. Sorry, but Lewis Katz should have known that Phil Jackson does not do Bennigan's, and when my old friend, Gumby, somehow survived over at the Garden, my career path came down to the Lakers or bringing Big Chief's triangle to Bill Bradley's inner circle and screening Al Gore out of the Democratic nomination.</p>

        <p>GREETINGS, fans, from sunny Los Angeles, California, center of the basketball universe, now that I, Phil Jackson, have spared David Stern a change of planes in Seattle and saved his league from the lowest-rated finals since the Lakers of Minneapolis and Mikan.</p>
        <p>The last time we communed in this particular space, I was holed up in Woodstock, legs crossed, caressing my whiskers, feigning interest in the New Jersey job. Sorry, but Lewis Katz should have known that Phil Jackson does not do Bennigan's, and when my old friend, Gumby, somehow survived over at the Garden, my career path came down to the Lakers or bringing Big Chief's triangle to Bill Bradley's inner circle and screening Al Gore out of the Democratic nomination.</p>
        <p>It was a difficult choice that wasn't about the money, but I went West and moved on with my life because, as Wu-Men said, ''If your mind isn't clouded by unnecessary things, this is the best season of your life.'' What can I say, now that I am on the verge of winning a ring without Michael, not to mention the two (ugh) Jerrys?</p>
        <p>And things have certainly worked out for all Americans, too, for with all due respect to the senator's social commitment, who in this country has done more to bring the races together in the last 20 years than Magic and Bird?</p>
        <p>Speaking of my coaching (heh-heh) rival for the next five or six games, it has come to my attention that many of the critics have been commenting on our similar bench styles, especially in the way we sit and do nothing. Well, I can't speak for Larry, who may very well be dreaming of the perfect fishing hole, but it requires a tremendous amount of self-control and calm to will a team to victory when it is down 15 points in the fourth quarter of Game 7.</p>
        <p>Unless you think those incredible 3-pointers fall for Brian Shaw with the help of Del Harris's puny brain waves?</p>
        <p>I admit I am not the same earthy fellow I was 15 years ago, when I coached in the basketball bushes and talked about organic experiences and went out for late-night fish 'n chips at roadside shacks in Pensacola. Am I a sellout just because I wear suspenders under my suit jacket and do online trading spots on television for P.D. Waterhouse? Times change. Garcia's gone. Consider me part new-age psychologist, part 60's guru, some kind of spiritual cross between Tony Robbins and Leonard Nimoy.</p>
        <p>Just look at the results and listen to the music. Shaq, the heretofore playoff flop and Gen X cynic, will soon be rappin' from the top of the mountain, and from that lofty perch will clearly see that he's only scratched the surface of his potential. Give me two more years with him -- the Daddy will be wearing the world's longest bell bottoms and groovin' to the Strawberry Alarm Clock.</p>
        <p>''Meditation, oooh....''.</p>
        <p>People (read: Pat Riley) may ask, ''Who wouldn't win with Shaq and Kobe?'' But here are two more questions that are not exactly a koan. Who to this point has won with Shaq and Kobe? And what other coach has had championship success with veterans weaned on 1980's values and the contemporary stars of the hip hop culture? By the time this is over, even ol' Riles will have emerged from his annual brooding season and just admit that I am a genius because, as Artur Schnabel said, ''The pauses between the notes -- ah, that is where the art resides.''</p>
        <p>Take it from me, he wasn't talking about Shaq at the free-throw line.</p>
        <p>Or Glen Rice trying to beat his man off the dribble, Ron Harper shooting the 3-pointer or A.C. Green shooting anything but a dunk. Let's face it, other than the two marquee attractions, I haven't exactly been working here with the cast of the Sopranos.</p>
        <p>Basketball, however, can be such a simple game when you are not one of those impossible control freaks, when you can sit back, cross your legs, caress your whiskers and apply the ancient Zen teachings.</p>
        <p>To wit: ''When a fish swims in the ocean, there is no limit to the water, no matter how far it swims. When a bird flies in the sky, there is no limit to the air, no matter how far it flies. However, no fish or bird has ever left its element since the beginning.''</p>
        <p>I believe that the ancient teachers, in their infinite wisdom and with their awesome powers of prognostication, were essentially telling us that a Bird on the bench and not on the court inevitably means that the Pacers are dead fish. As I said, five or six games, and it's a wrap.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 8, 2000, Thursday  An article yesterday about the primary in New Jersey referred incorrectly to the rarity of a United States Senate race there without an incumbent. Bill Bradley chose not to seek re-election in 1996; Senator Frank R. Lautenberg's decision last year to step down at the end of his term was not the first such move in 18 years.</p>
