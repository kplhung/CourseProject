        <p>Opera, more than virtually any other musical style, is about flesh and blood. The overheated sweep of its stories, the swell of its choruses and the toil of its divas make it the supremely human art form. But what constitutes opera's bones? Melody, according to Bill Laswell, Alan Douglas and Karl Berger. Stripping away opera's familiar shape, these three genre-whacking veterans created Operazone.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Douglas nor Mr. Laswell, who conceived of and originally produced Operazone, were visibly present on Monday at the Angel Orensanz Foundation during the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, where Mr. Berger led a diverse ensemble through this project's reworkings. The evening unfolded differently, too, from the Operazone album, a recent Knitting Factory Records release. Connecting this show with the incandescent music on that disc were Mr. Berger, who arranged and conducted both versions, and those operatic bones.</p>
        <p>The skeleton of Operazone is made up of phrases from Verdi, Saint-Saens, Donizetti and Puccini. ''They're the most beautiful melodies on earth, aren't they?'' Mr. Berger said of why he and his mates wanted to reharmonize them and offer them up for total reinterpretation. On the Operazone album, the clean strains of these familiar compositions guide a mellow journey into contemplation. Live, the reinterpretations were more exuberant, but sometimes the melodies were more recklessly undone.</p>
        <p>The only player from the album to also appear on Monday was Graham Haynes, whose chivalrous fluegelhorn playing made the case for a sensibility shared by jazz and opera buffs. Nearly as fluid was Art Baron, who played euphonium, trombone and didjeridoo. Peter Apfelbaum, on saxophone and flute, intruded more aggressively on the melodies, turning them into Andean airs, for example, or soulful raves. Mr. Apfelbaum's solos honored his own adventurous nature rather than deferring to the music's source.</p>
        <p>The rhythm section was even more important in inspiring reinvention. Karsh Kalel on tablas and Hamid Drake on drums added a loose dynamism very different from an orchestra's pull. Ed Schuler on bass rooted the rhythms in bebop.</p>
        <p>With so much jazz surrounding them, the string players clung hard to the melodies guiding the music. Operazone's most enchanting moments arose when the strings dialectically collided with the music's other elements. In some cases, the music's parts merged and separated like dusky shadows. Sometimes the players aggressively pursued each other, feeding the music's fire.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, everyone got lost, as when Mr. Berger took a long anticipated solo on vibes near the program's end. His ensemble used that chance to confer rather loudly about where they were in the score. Finally the band pulled itself together by returning to that firm infrastructure. The melodies gave them a leg to stand on, and by respectfully elaborating on them, Operazone managed to animate both itself and classic opera's treasured remains.</p>
