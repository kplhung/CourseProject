        <p>IN Seattle, an e-commerce start-up is looking for an Internet Code Warrior. In San Francisco, a high-technology company needs an XML Guru. In Albany, a computermaker has an opening for an E-Commerce Solution Architect.</p>
        <p>Those job titles, from a recent batch of electronic help-wanted ads, are at once grandiose and vague, designed to suggest the limitless possibilities of careers in cyberspace. In a labor market so tight that stock options and BMW's elicit a yawn, some personnel managers hope that titles with a little panache will give them an edge.</p>
        <p>Exotic job titles have been part of cyberspace culture since the beginning, before computer geeks were masters of the universe and were simply looking for respect.</p>
        <p>''Weird titles are so much the norm in Silicon Valley that after you've been here for any time at all, you stop noticing it,'' said Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. The practice began at Apple Computer in the mid-1980's, he said. Everyone was allowed to have two business cards, one with a formal title and the other with any title they wanted.</p>
        <p>Titles were more entertaining then, Mr. Saffo said. One Apple employee called himself Director/Off-Planet Operations. But after a junior employee put ''chairman'' on his second card, Apple put limits on the practice, he added.</p>
        <p>One of the earliest and most creative titles belonged to Guy Kawasaki, who was known as Apple's ''Software Evangelist,'' when the company was struggling for a share of the evolving personal computer marketplace. Mr. Kawasaki joined Apple in 1983, when the Macintosh PC was viewed as innovative but too slow for business users.</p>
        <p>His job was to use the fervor of a missionary to persuade software developers to write programs for the machines. Since then, others have used the term, and others like it, but they have become so commonplace that they now have little meaning, Mr. Saffo said. ''The first man to compare his lover's lips to a rose was quite possibly a genius, but the second one and everyone after that were quite certainly not.''</p>
        <p>Titles like ''visionary'' came into being because in cyberspace's early days, people saw themselves as having a broader mission than the ordinary worker, said Jan English Lueck, the chairwoman of the anthropology department at San Jose State University in California. ''It's very closely linked to a worldview that they're doing higher work,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Of course, many in the computer industry do not take themselves quite so seriously.</p>
        <p>At America Online, David Baker, a graphic designer, was known as the Vice President of Cool in the mid-1990's. His job was to think of ''cool and interesting ways'' to present the company's site to users, said Tricia Primrose, a spokeswoman for America Online. And Russ Leatherman, the voice and president of AOL Moviefone, is commonly known as Mr. Moviefone.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the English language just does not contain words adequate to describe what's happening in cyberspace, and so, it would seem, new words must be invented. One is ''cybrarian,'' which has forced its way into some acceptance. No less staid a body than the American Library Association has begun publishing a ''Cybrarian's Manual,'' with sections on ''cyberciting'' and ''civic cybrarianship.''</p>
        <p>Susan Geller Ettenheim, who holds the title of cybrarian at Cybergrrl Inc., said she  was a combination of librarian and Internet specialist. Her services are available through www.femina.com, a directory of international links to Web sites for women.</p>
        <p>But some job recruiters offer a warning to companies tempted to get too creative with job titles: potential employees may not know what you're talking about.</p>
        <p>''The simpler you make the title, the more likely you are to attract a candidate,'' said David Garcia, a recruiter for Hall Kinion, an information technology employment firm in Cupertino, Calif. Someone searching for a job as a senior software engineer is likely to search using those key words, he said. If the position is advertised as a ''guru,'' the applicant may never see it.</p>
        <p>At the very least, Mr. Garcia said, the title should be comprehensible. He said he once tried to fill a company's request for a ''product manager for syndicated services,'' but no one was able to explain what that was. ''I have no idea. I never did know. And they wanted someone with two to three years' experience.'' As far as he knows, Mr. Garcia said, the company is still looking.</p>
