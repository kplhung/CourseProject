        <p>Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will resume talks on a permanent peace accord next week in the Washington area, and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, will meet with President Clinton there next Wednesday, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today.</p>
        <p>The talks in Washington, as well as Mr. Arafat's meeting with Mr. Clinton, are intended to set the stage for a three-way, retreat-style summit meeting in the near future. As Dr. Albright shuttled between Israeli and Palestinian leaders today, she continued her efforts to kick the slow-moving talks into a higher gear, one that conforms better to the finite Clinton administration timetable.</p>
        <p>''We are taking, if it is possible to say it this way, one step at a time as quickly as possible,'' Dr. Albright said today as she stood beside Mr. Arafat in the bare courtyard of his stucco compound here.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright's diplomacy took place against the backdrop of Israel's volatile political scene. As she met with Prime Minister Ehud Barak in Jerusalem this evening, a right-wing bill to dissolve the Parliament and hold new elections was gaining steady support, including some backing among parties inside the ruling coalition. Some of the discontent grows out of financial disputes in the government, and some represents opposition to the peace negotiations.</p>
        <p>A vote on Wednesday will not bring down the government, even if successful; the bill is preliminary and requires three more hearings. But it could end up breaking apart the governing coalition and forcing Mr. Barak to reshape it and either include Arab parties or preside over a minority government. A new political lineup could shrink Mr. Barak's base of support in Parliament for any peace agreement, since the swing parties would have swung out of his broad-based government and into the right wing opposition. At any rate, the political turmoil could hobble the prime minister at the start of a period of intense negotiations, if only by distracting him.</p>
        <p>After a two-week hiatus following a violent uprising in the West Bank and Gaza, the talks are supposed to begin anew on Monday and last at least through the week. The senior Israeli and Palestinian officials who were making some progress in the so-called back channel talks in Stockholm will move front and center as the new official teams.</p>
        <p>In Sweden, those teams were led by Shlomo Ben-Ami, the Israeli internal security minister and a rising star in Mr. Barak's Labor Party, and Abu Ala, the speaker of the Palestinian legislature and a key negotiator for the Oslo interim peace agreement of 1993.</p>
        <p>In the United States, the American peace team led by Dennis Ross, the Middle East peace envoy, will join them as it did briefly in Sweden.</p>
        <p>In Sweden, ''the two sides became more open with each other,'' a senior administration official said. ''And as they made an effort to try to respond to each other, you could also see where the limitations were. But there was an increased feeling that they were doing what I'd describe as real business.''</p>
        <p>In next week's negotiations, the Americans will try to guide the two sides to a point where they can contemplate how the gaps on various issues could be bridged. Before a summit meeting is convened, they want to lay enough basis for the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to be able to get together and make decisions. ''We're not at the endgame yet,'' the senior administration official said.</p>
        <p>For a summit meeting, the parties are contemplating a Camp David-style meeting modeled on the Israeli-Egyptian talks in 1978, which produced the first Israeli-Arab peace treaty a year later.</p>
        <p>This would cast Mr. Clinton in the hands-on role that President Carter played at Camp David. It would also set the stage for Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak to leapfrog over their deep-seated, seemingly unresolvable differences and make fast, big decisions on very complex issues.</p>
        <p>After meeting with Mr. Barak in Lisbon last week, Mr. Clinton emerged saying optimistically that a peace agreement was ''within view.'' His optimism was not echoed publicly by the parties here, who instead exchanged accusations of foot-dragging and described significant gaps on every major issue.</p>
        <p>But the fact that they are once again returning to the negotiating table is a good sign, especially after the month of May in which the dynamic of the Middle East changed considerably. First, the Palestinians returned to the streets in violent demonstrations that recalled scenes from the uprising of the late 1980's. And then, Israel withdrew from Lebanon, which the Arab world took as a victory for armed struggle.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Arafat, who spoke with a strong, unfaltering voice, sought to refute Israeli claims that the Palestinians have been retreating into well-worn, hard-line positions.</p>
        <p>Their mere presence at the negotiating table, he said, demonstrated their flexibility.</p>
        <p>''We have demonstrated over and over our many flexibilities,'' Mr. Arafat said, ''especially by going through this process, which started a long time ago with my previous partner, the late Prime Minister Rabin.''</p>
        <p>Yitzhak Rabin and Mr. Arafat reached an agreement in principle on a peace settlement in 1993. But the Israeli-Palestinian negotiating relationship has unraveled many times since, especially after Mr. Rabin was assassinated by an ultra-nationalist Israeli in 1995.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Arafat bristled when a reporter asked if he considered Mr. Barak to be a partner in the mold of Mr. Rabin. ''I think this question intends to destroy the Palestinian-Israeli relationship and I will not answer it,'' he snapped.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright addressed a rising frustration in the West Bank and Gaza with a peace effort that after seven years still leaves the Palestinians there living either under direct Israeli occupation or in areas whose entrances and exits are controlled by Israeli security forces.</p>
        <p>Many Palestinians distrust the negotiations as a process controlled by the Israelis and the Americans to their disadvantage, and some of them wonder, especially after Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon, if the armed struggle should be renewed.</p>
        <p>''I know that the last several  weeks have been difficult for Palestinians,'' Dr. Albright said. ''And I know there are those who say that the negotiations cannot succeed in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations. But those voices belong to the past. Indeed, they seek to perpetuate the fears of the past, rather than building on the hope and promise of the future.''</p>

        <p>Jordan's King in Washington</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON, June 6 (Reuters) -- The Middle East peace effort dominated White House talks today between President Clinton and King Abdullah of Jordan.</p>
        <p>P. J. Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said both leaders agreed on the need to make progress on the Israeli-Palestinian talks as well as the stalled Israeli-Syrian peace effort.</p>
        <p>The two leaders also agreed that their governments would open bilateral free-trade talks. Trade between the two countries now totals some $307 million a year.</p>
