        <p>Dealing another blow to Indonesia's embattled former leader, Suharto, a court ruled today that Time magazine did not libel him in an article that said Mr. Suharto and his family had amassed a $15 billion fortune in his three decades in power.</p>

        <p>Dealing another blow to Indonesia's embattled former leader, Suharto, a court ruled today that Time magazine did not libel him in an article that said Mr. Suharto and his family had amassed a $15 billion fortune in his three decades in power.</p>
        <p>The court dismissed Mr. Suharto's contention that the magazine damaged his reputation with the article, which reported that he transferred $9 billion from a bank in Switzerland to a bank in Austria shortly after he was stampeded out of office in violent protests in May 1998.</p>
        <p>''According to the evidence, it is clear that the article was not fabricated, but was based on facts,'' said the ruling by a three-judge panel of the Central Jakarta District Court. The judges also said they respected Time's refusal to reveal its confidential sources.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suharto's lawyers said they would meet with him before deciding whether to appeal the verdict. One lawyer, Denny Kailimang, noted that the ruling did not validate the assertions in the article. He said it merely upheld Time's argument in the trial that it reported information that had appeared in other publications like Barron's.</p>
        <p>Still, as he watched the judges being congratulated after the verdict, even Mr. Kailimang said he was struck by the sight of an Indonesian court's siding with a foreign publication against the man who once dominated this country. ''This is something totally new for Indonesia,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The decision was hailed as a victory for the news media in Indonesia, which is savoring new freedoms in the post-Suharto era but still bears memories of long years of repression. It was also a welcome sign to many that the court could not be manipulated by Mr. Suharto or his loyalists.</p>
        <p>''This is a big boost for the profession of journalism in Indonesia,'' said Sabam Siagian, a columnist and the former editor of The Jakarta Post, the largest English-language newspaper here. ''Suharto is not totally harmless, but he is not the Suharto of few years ago.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the ruling is yet more evidence that Mr. Suharto's power base is crumbling like a sand castle. Last week, the 78-year-old former ruler was placed under house arrest as the government intensified its investigation of corruption and abuse of power in his regime.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Suharto was interrogated for two hours by state prosecutors on charges that he misused millions of dollars of state funds collected by his charitable foundations. Attorney General Marsuki Darusman has pledged to take Mr. Suharto before a court by Aug. 10.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Suharto's legal woes are receiving the most attention, there are signs that the government is turning up the heat on other long-simmering scandals. On Monday, the governor of the central bank was cited as a suspect in the Bank Bali affair, in which a troubled bank paid off politically connected officials to intervene in its favor. The governor, Syahril Sabirin, denies wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>The government is also looking into allegations that an official of the state logistics agency funneled $4.2 million out of the agency at the behest of President Abdurrahman Wahid. Indonesians, who by now are inured to scandal, dismiss this one as small potatoes.</p>
        <p>The Time article, on the other hand, described a pattern of misappropriation remarkable even for the most larcenous of autocrats.</p>
