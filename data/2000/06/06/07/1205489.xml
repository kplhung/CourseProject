        <p>If the movie ''The Insider'' made anything clear about Jeffrey S. Wigand, it is this: Trying to shut him up is futile, and is only liable to make him talk more about tobacco companies. For that reason alone, his treatment by the Pataki administration is a bit surprising.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wigand was barred from speaking last weekend at a conference on youth smoking held by the State Health Department. Department officials had learned that he planned to criticize Gov. George E. Pataki for, among other things, recently vetoing a bill that would have imposed fire safety standards on cigarettes.</p>
        <p>''It's reminiscent of my Brown &amp; Williamson days,'' Mr. Wigand, whose role as a tobacco industry whistle-blower was portrayed in ''The Insider,'' said today in an interview. ''It's deja vu. I can't believe that somebody tells me I can't speak about what is factually true.''</p>
        <p>A Health Department spokesman, John Signor, confirmed most of Mr. Wigand's account, but disputed some of the specifics. He said that Mr. Wigand violated an agreement not to inject politics into the event, a contention disputed by Mr. Wigand and the consulting company that organized the conference.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wigand worked as a researcher for Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco. He revealed, first to the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' and then to officials of states that were suing cigarette makers, the industry's manipulation of nicotine levels in cigarettes and its secret research on nicotine addiction. The more the industry pressured him to stay quiet, the more determined he became to talk.</p>
        <p>''The Insider,'' released last year, was nominated for an Oscar for best picture. The movie, directed by Michael Mann, starred Russell Crowe as Mr. Wigand and Al Pacino as a ''60 Minutes'' producer, Lowell Bergman.</p>
        <p>''Apparently, these guys didn't see the movie,'' Russell Sciandra, director of the Center for a Tobacco-Free New York, said of the Pataki administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wigand's dismissal from the conference was one of several recent hardball moves by the administration aimed at people who disagree with it on issues. The governor recently ordered the firing of the directors of two agencies that advise local communities on development along the Hudson River, then fired the chairman of one of those agencies when he resisted.</p>
        <p>This week, Alice Green, a longtime advocate for prison inmates and a frequent critic of Mr. Pataki, was notified that she was barred from all state prisons. State officials called her a threat to safety, saying that she had tried to organize an inmate strike, an assertion she denied.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wigand's clash with the administration occurred Friday at a ''youth summit'' held by the Health Department at the Friar Tuck Inn, a resort in Catskill, N.Y. The department invited more than 150 teenagers to discuss antismoking programs at the event, the first of its kind in the state. Among those attending was Mr. Pataki's health commissioner, Dr. Antonia C. Novello.</p>
        <p>The department hired The Nixon Group, a Miami-based consulting company, to put the conference together, and brought in Mr. Wigand, now a sought-after public speaker, to address the group. He was to be paid $2,000.</p>
        <p>Before the conference, Mr. Signor said, ''He talked to The Nixon Group and he gave them assurances, he gave them his word, that he would only talk about 'The Insider.' ''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wigand said no restrictions had been placed on what he would say, an account supported by Erin Hart, managing director of The Nixon Group. Ms. Hart said her company had understood that he would tell his story as a tobacco company employee turned dissident, as Mr. Wigand said he intended to do. She said that the company was displeased at learning that he planned to delve into politics, but that there had been no prior limits on his speech.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wigand arrived at the conference Thursday night; he said he spent much of Friday mingling with the teenagers and adult chaperones. Before his Friday night speech, a Health Department official asked what he planned to say.</p>
        <p>''I said I was going to say my usual things,'' he said, ''about why I went to Brown &amp; Williamson, why I left, the health effects of smoking, the effect of truth campaigns on teen smoking.'' But he said he would also criticize Mr. Pataki for the use of money from the settlement of tobacco litigation and ''for vetoing the fire-safe cigarettes bill.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Signor, who attended the conference, said Mr. Wigand's answer to the question was, ''I'm going to give some political comments,'' making it clear that criticism of the governor would be his focus.</p>
        <p>Both sides agree that Health Department officials conferred, then told Mr. Wigand that he would not be allowed to speak if he stuck to his planned remarks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wigand said that after some argument, he agreed to abide by his hosts' restrictions and leave Mr. Pataki out of his talk -- an account that Mr. Signor repeatedly refused to confirm or deny.</p>
        <p>After department officials conferred again, Mr. Signor told Mr. Wigand that he would not be allowed to speak.</p>
        <p>Mr. Signor said the department canceled the speech on the advice of The Nixon Group, but Ms. Hart said she did not believe any company employee had advocated such a move.</p>
        <p>As for his fee, Mr. Wigand said, ''I'm not sure I'm going to send a bill to them.''</p>
