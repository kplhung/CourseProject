        <p>Walk through the modest front door of Nova Peris-Kneebone's Victorian home and you soon come face to frame with a picture of Muhammad Ali standing on a stage next to Peris-Kneebone's young daughter Jessica.</p>
        <p>''Melbourne 1998 just after the Commonwealth Games,'' Peris-Kneebone explains proudly. ''He was in a boxing ring here for an appearance, and the people who brought him here, they introduced us to Muhammad and brought Jessie up on stage, and you know he has this affiliation with children. So he went straight up to Jessie and held her hand and would not let it go. It was unbelievable, a very special moment.''</p>
        <p>But there is more linking Ali and Peris-Kneebone than a small child's grasp. In 1996, when the Summer Olympics were last held, Ali was the last person to carry the torch. Trembling from disease, he lit the Olympic flame during the opening ceremony in Atlanta, sending goose bumps down Peris-Kneebone's and a lot of other spines.</p>
        <p>Now, nearly four years later, it is her turn to play a leading role, and on June 8 in Australia, when the flame arrives at the sacred Aboriginal site of Uluru to begin a 100-day tour of the sprawling continent before reaching Sydney, Peris-Kneebone will be the first Australian to carry it when it is unloaded from the plane.</p>
        <p>She will do so with the massive and magnificent red monolith -- dubbed Ayers Rock by the white European settlers but long called Uluru by the Aboriginals -- looming telegenically in the background. She will do so because Sydney Olympic organizers, eager to project an inclusive and updated vision of Australia, found her multifaceted, multicultural background irresistible even though other Australian athletes have accomplished more.</p>
        <p>Peris-Kneebone is confident that this moment, her moment, will have resonance. ''To have an Aboriginal person carrying that flame is going to make a hell of a lot of people very proud,'' Peris-Kneebone said earlier this year.</p>
        <p>But there is more to it than her rich brown skin; there is the content of her character and of her resume. At 29, Peris-Kneebone is a mother, an artist and a world-class sportswoman in the midst of a career change. In 1996 in Atlanta, she became the first athlete of Aboriginal descent (she also has Filipino and European ancestors) to win an Olympic gold medal, as a member of the Australian women's field hockey team. Several months later, she retired from hockey and decided to train to become an elite sprinter.</p>
        <p>''If I was to show you my scrapbook as a kid, track and field was my first love,'' she said. ''And that's what I'm going after this year: my first childhood love.''</p>
        <p>After surprising the field and herself to win the gold medal in the 200 meters at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, she is now focusing her energies on the 200 and the 400 in the lead-up to the much more competitive races in Sydney. Though her chances of an individual gold medal are extremely slim -- her goal is to reach a final -- she and an even more prominent Aboriginal runner, Cathy Freeman, could win a medal together if Peris-Kneebone manages to qualify for the 4 x 400 relay.</p>
        <p>''I think she can do it,'' said Freeman, who won a silver medal in the 400 in Atlanta and has won the last two world titles over the distance. ''No matter what happens, I have a lot of respect for Nova, because she's very courageous. She chases her dreams.''</p>
        <p>The chase has sometimes resembled an obstacle course. Born in 1971, Peris- Kneebone and her younger sister were raised by their mother, a single parent, in a two-bedroom house in Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory. When Peris-Kneebone was 10, her mother remarried and, according to Peris-Kneebone, the atmosphere changed dramatically.</p>
        <p>''My stepfather was a policeman, a very hard, strict man,'' she said. ''I was really stubborn as a kid and him coming into our lives at such a late stage, he was stubborn and I was stubborn and he had to sort of chase me down to grab hold of me. There was none of that sit in the corner and face the wall kind of thing. I was always being chased across the road with a strap. But he was fair. He hated lying, so as a kid, if you ever told a fib, you got the belt. If you told the truth, it was fine.''</p>
        <p>At 13, largely because of a dearth of track and field programs in Darwin, Peris-Kneebone focused her energies on field hockey, a popular sport throughout Australia, and was soon one of the best prospects in the country. But at 19, she gave birth to Jessica in 1990.</p>
        <p>''The whole 12 months after Jessie was born, I was just happy being a mum,'' she said. ''It wasn't until 1991 that I thought, 'The dream is still there: if you want, you can go after it.' ''</p>
        <p>The following year, she moved with Jessica to the western city of Perth, where the national hockey team trains. She took a job with the Australian telephone company and juggled day care, practice and part-time employment while Jessica's father and Peris-Kneebone's future husband, Sean Kneebone, remained in Darwin attempting to build a career of his own in case her hockey career foundered.</p>
        <p>''I'd put Jessie up in the stands with her coloring books or dolls and a little lunch box and drinks,'' Peris-Kneebone said. ''There were times on Tuesday evenings, I'd have psychology meetings and she'd come and sit underneath the table with a coloring book and the other girls in the room wouldn't even know she was there. She was just so quiet and did her own thing. She'll be one of those people when she gets older who will love sport or hate it, because she's seen the hard work that goes into me achieving, seen all the highs and lows.''</p>
        <p>For now, the Kneebones divide their time between their rented house full of photographs in Melbourne and their family and spiritual base in Darwin. Aboriginal people represent approximately 2 percent of Australia's population of about 19 million but they make up approximately 20 percent of the population in the Northern Territory and own about one-fourth of the property because of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act passed in 1976.</p>
        <p>Aboriginal landowners are called ''traditional owners'' in Australia, and Peris-Kneebone is a traditional owner in Kakadu National Park, where she often fishes, camps and hunts with her family. As a custodian of the land, Peris-Kneebone is in regular contact with tribal elders, including her biological father, with whom she had virtually no contact until he went to visit her after Jessica's birth. Her father lives a traditional, seminomadic aboriginal life style.</p>
        <p>''It's funny, I spent 18 years apart from him and yet we are so much alike in so many ways,'' she said. ''I never see him with a watch on his wrist because time doesn't matter. He's lived out in really harsh places on the Coburg Peninsula, living off the land for eight months at a time.''</p>
        <p>It is on her people's land and with her father that Peris-Kneebone has worked through her problems in the last two years. First came her post-Commonwealth Games depression in late 1998, when she quickly grew weary of the interest in her private life that accompanied her increased celebrity. It was all very petty to Peris-Kneebone -- complaints that she wore too much gold jewelry or that she had grown too arrogant for a society that values egalitarianism. Irritated, she considered returning to the more anonymous existence of a hockey team member.</p>
        <p>''I have no problem getting criticized for my performances, but when they start to get into my personal life, I have a problem,'' she said. ''I have a daughter who goes to school and has to face the music and people saying, 'Is this true about your mum?' And she gets really upset about it, and I'd had a gut-full, an absolute gut-full of the stuff.''</p>
        <p>''She was all ready to go back to hockey,'' Sean said. ''It was all done and then about a week before it was announced, she was watching video of the Commonwealth Games final and just turned around and said, 'I can't do this. I'd be quitting, leaving the sport for the wrong reasons.' ''</p>
        <p>There have been calls from many Aboriginal leaders to use the Games as a platform for increasing international awareness of the intense discrimination Aboriginals faced after European settlement in the 18th and 19th centuries. Aboriginals were only granted full citizenship in 1967, and even now, their life spans are nearly 20 years lower on average than the rest of the Australian population, while unemployment, child mortality and criminality rates are significantly higher.</p>
        <p>Australia's attitudes and policies toward Aboriginals have evolved considerably, but Peris-Kneebone knows there is more progress to be made. Yet she often feels divided: eager to capitalize on a unique opportunity and spread the word; worried about spreading herself thin and missing out on her athletic goal.</p>
        <p>''There has been some discussion of a boycott, but the grass roots people tell us to run, tell us, 'You're the one that inspires our children and gives hope to our race.' '' Peris-Kneebone said.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, there will certainly be Aboriginal protests of some type at the Games in September, and there could also be some form of protest at Uluru when Peris-Kneebone becomes the first of 10,000 Australians, including the golfer Greg Norman, to run with the torch. Peris-Kneebone understands there is anger out there, but for now she is more interested in carrying flames than fanning them. And when she's asked what message she wants to convey to the world 100 days before the Olympics begin, she harkens back to a conversation she and Sean had not long ago with one of the grizzled elders from Kakadu known as Old Man Bill. The conversation started out being about Peris-Kneebone's gold medals but it ended up being about something more universal.</p>
        <p>''All of the sudden he sort of looked at Sean and said, 'Do you want to learn?' '' Peris-Kneebone said. ''And Sean told him, 'Yeah I want to learn, and Old Man Bill told him, 'No matter what color skin you got, we all got the same color blood.' ''</p>
