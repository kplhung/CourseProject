        <p>Jon S. Corzine may have easily defeated Jim Florio last night, but Mr. Florio can take some small comfort in this statistic: he got about 10 times as much bang for his campaign-spending buck as Mr. Corzine did.</p>
        <p>With about 98 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Corzine had collected 246,472 votes to Mr. Florio's 179,059. If the remaining precincts voted the same way, Mr. Corzine stood to receive a total of 250,409 votes and Mr. Florio, 181,919.</p>

        <p>That would mean that Mr. Corzine, who poured $35 million into the primary, wound up spending approximately $140 for each vote cast in his favor. Mr. Florio, whose campaign cost a mere $2.5 million, spent just $13.75 per vote.</p>
