        <p>When is a repeat better than a first run of a show? The answer: When it is a summer edition of a news-magazine show.</p>
        <p>The CBS news magazine ''48 Hours,'' which spends the regular television season getting drubbed on Thursday nights by NBC's ''E.R.,'' kicked off a monthlong run of repeats repackaged as ''48 Hours Mysteries'' on Monday night.</p>
        <p>The result was a higher rating than ''48 Hours'' reached all television season with original shows. This was a repeat from October about the murder of a Michigan woman.</p>
        <p>The news magazine will have five of these mystery editions on Mondays and Saturdays for the rest of the month.</p>
        <p>The repeat of ''48 Hours'' was by far the most watched program Monday night. Left in the dust was the Devils-Stars, N.H.L. Stanley Cup Finals game on ABC, providing further proof that hockey is a not-ready-for-prime-time sport.</p>
        <p>''48 Hours'' almost quadrupled the audience for the hockey game, which was not a repeat.</p>
