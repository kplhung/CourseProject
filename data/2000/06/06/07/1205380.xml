        <p>LIKE a character actor who takes roles as a serial killer after years of playing the kindly uncle, civic boosters here are trying to shed the cardigan sweater and the sensible shoes. There is a palpable desire to be a technology hot spot.</p>
        <p>But how? Over the last couple of years, Technophilly, SiliconPhilly, Silicon ValleyForge, @Philly and Philacon Valley have been floated in efforts to raise the region's brand awareness, on the theory that recognition and corporate dollars would follow. Some names have Web sites or printed materials behind them, but not one of the monikers has stuck.</p>

        <p>LIKE a character actor who takes roles as a serial killer after years of playing the kindly uncle, civic boosters here are trying to shed the cardigan sweater and the sensible shoes. There is a palpable desire to be a technology hot spot.</p>
        <p>But how? Over the last couple of years, Technophilly, SiliconPhilly, Silicon ValleyForge, @Philly and Philacon Valley have been floated in efforts to raise the region's brand awareness, on the theory that recognition and corporate dollars would follow. Some names have Web sites or printed materials behind them, but not one of the monikers has stuck.</p>
        <p>As any athlete knows, nicknames are given, not manufactured. Philadelphia is not as complacent and dowdy as its critics say. It has its power lunchers, its venture capitalists who chat casually about jaw-dropping sums. But it is not the technology mecca envisioned by its boosters. And when the city was omitted from a Wall Street Journal list of the top 20 technology areas last November, the slight touched off a quest for attention that would have made the region's  Quaker settlers twitch uncomfortably.</p>
        <p>Civic leaders want an e-business scene, just as earlier civic efforts tried to recognize the city's movie, restaurant and film notables. The actor Will Smith, Ben Vaughn, a rocker, and the rap group The Roots are hometown heroes, but the enduring reputation is ''The Sound of Philadelphia,'' soul and pop music created by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff two decades ago. Movies recently filmed here include the creepy ''Twelve Monkeys'' and ''The Sixth Sense,'' hardly the stuff shown by the chamber of commerce to foster corporate relocation.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia has long had an identity crisis, flanked on the north by New York's financial and media capital and on the south by the political capital, Washington.</p>
        <p>Defining the region is exasperating because of its diversity, said David Thornburgh, the executive director of the Pennsylvania Economy League, a public policy and research organization. The region encompasses some of the former steel towns of Pennsylvania and the shore resorts of New Jersey. Unlike Las Vegas or Detroit, where tourism or automotive industries serve as bellwethers, Philadelphia companies enjoy a strong reputation in credit, finance, insurance, medical education and care, biotechnology and pharmaceutical research, among other industries.</p>
        <p>''There's been no image defined in the public psyche since 'Rocky,' '' Mr. Thornburgh said. ''But we could become the buckle on the East Coast's money belt because of our location. And our strength is in putting things together as an integrator.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, as in San Francisco or Boston, there is no single technology epicenter in the city. Philadelphia's downtown lofts and 19th-century storefronts now house computer graphics or e-business start-ups and electronic-art galleries.</p>
        <p>That streetscape contrasts with acres of suburban office parks where companies vie for room to grow alongside countless consultants, training firms and support service providers. Devon Consulting, in the Main Line borough of Wayne, uses the parking lot for advertising. A Plymouth Prowler sporting the company's logo reminds clients that a successful referral may bring a week's use of the car.</p>
        <p>Many argue that the region's reputation as a technology center will grow as more companies migrate to the Internet. There are now companies that excel in particular applications, among them SEI Investments in Oaks, Pa., which provides technology services and asset management for banks and investment companies.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, we've never been able to birth a megacompany like AOL, Microsoft or Sun Microsystems,'' said Howard Ross, an adviser to emerging companies since the 1980's and a principal in LLR Equity Partners, a new venture fund. ''But this area could wake up and surprise itself.''</p>
        <p>ONE reason for Mr. Ross's optimism is his argument that Boston and San Jose, Calif., had the first significant concentrations of venture capital, but the capital that creates companies is now flowing into other areas. In just the last three years, more than $50 billion in wealth was created on paper by three local companies. The charge has been led by the Safeguard Scientifics Corporation of Wayne, Pa, a publicly traded venture-capital investor, which backed two of the most successful public offerings in 1999, Internet Capital Group and VerticalNet.</p>
        <p>Much of the e-commerce activity is in the business-to-business market, where less glamorous companies make the consumer dot-coms look good by providing the systems and fulfillment processes that power consumer Web sites.</p>
        <p>Major corporations based here include QVC Network Inc., the Comcast Corporation, SAP Americas Inc. and Aetna U.S. Healthcare. Yet there are several obstacles to growth, said Stephen Mullin, a former commerce director for the City of Philadelphia who teaches college courses on e-commerce and is a consultant.</p>
        <p>He points to a city tax structure that punishes companies by taxing both wages and net profits as one explanation as to why  most of the expansion has been in the suburbs instead of downtown.</p>
        <p>Looking to distinguish itself, a study found that Philadelphia's cost of living, relative to a technology professional's salary, ranked third lowest, behind Dallas and Chicago, among 15 cities. Robert Hollebeek, a data-mining expert, found the region was in a top  spot in the number and density of colleges and universities. The residents of those 88 institutions, however, are transient, with one-quarter of the population coming and going each year, many taking business plans with them.</p>
        <p>Innovative start-up ideas are being exported from Temple, Villanova and Drexel universities and the University of Pennsylvania, where the first electronic computer was created, in 1946.</p>
        <p>Last month, it was announced that eTechtransfer.com, a business-to-business marketplace for the life-sciences industry, won the 2000 Wharton Business Plan competition. The prize was $15,000 cash and a $10,000 investment from Safeguard Scientifics. The 1999 winner, Paymybills.com, got snapped up by a California incubator, which disappointed local technology leaders.</p>
        <p>To help stem the talent flight, the Eastern Technology Council, a regional industry group, has supported a program of scholarships, financing assistance for start-ups and using mentoring efforts to keep students here after graduation.</p>
        <p>''Philadelphia's business plans are farther along than other cities', but the ideas that emerge here are going other places,'' said George Boyajian, a managing director of RoundTable Partners, which advises emerging companies. ''As more 'smart money' comes into the area, more deals are getting done. But the traditional Quaker banking, insurance and real estate money is remarkably risk averse.''</p>
        <p>Still, the buzz of entrepreneurship is growing louder. At a student-entrepreneur forum organized by Mr. Boyajian at the University of Pennsylvania, 40 of the 60 undergraduates there said they had started a company.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the search for a glamour tag continues. One local entrepreneur has tried out the idea that the area could be billed as being twice as important as Silicon Valley, whose technology companies are clustered around Route 101. Philadelphia's straddle Route 202.</p>
