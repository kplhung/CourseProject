        <p>Jon S. Corzine, the Wall Street multimillionaire whose $35 million spending spree shattered all records for a Senate race, easily defeated former Gov. Jim Florio on Tuesday in the Democratic primary for the seat being vacated by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg.</p>
        <p>In the four-way Republican primary, Representative Robert D.  Franks, a four-term congressman from Union County, declared victory at 12:20 a.m. today over State Senator William L. Gormley, a veteran lawmaker from the Atlantic City area who nonetheless refused to concede.</p>
        <p>''Make no mistake,'' Mr. Corzine shouted to the crowd at a hotel ballroom in East Brunswick. ''I want to invest in America. That's what this campaign will be about.''</p>
        <p>Conceding defeat Tuesday night at 10:35, Mr. Florio said he would support his rival. ''This has been a tough campaign, this has been a very spirited campaign,'' Mr. Florio told dispirited supporters at a hotel in Cherry Hill. ''I disagree with Jon Corzine on a number of issues, but I agree with him a lot more than I would agree with any of the Republicans who are running for that office.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio's aides had hoped that a low turnout caused by heavy rains Tuesday morning would favor him, but in unofficial returns reported by The Associated Press, with 98 percent of districts reporting, Mr. Corzine had 246,472 votes, 58 percent, to  179,059, 42 percent, for Mr. Florio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, in his victory speech, likened himself to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former President Ronald Reagan, Gen. Colin Powell and Senator John McCain. But he also acknowledged his relatively poor name recognition and quickly borrowed a line of Mr. Florio's to begin his campaign against Mr. Corzine.</p>
        <p>''Good evening, New Jersey, I'm Bob Franks, the candidate with experience that money can't buy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gormley, speaking simultaneously in Egg Harbor, refused to admit defeat, saying about 100 precincts had yet to report results. ''We're going to look at the numbers and wait until everything comes in,'' he said. ''It's not my intention to needlessly prolong this process.''</p>
        <p>With 98 percent of districts reporting, Mr. Franks had 95,916 votes, or 35 percent; Mr. Gormley had 92,324 votes, or 34 percent; James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, had 47,902, 18 percent; and Murray Sabrin, who ran for governor as a Libertarian in 1997, had 34,182, 13  percent.</p>
        <p>At the national level, Mr. Corzine's stated willingness to spend whatever it took to win puts a burden on Republicans, who a year ago, when Governor Whitman was still a Senate candidate, had viewed New Jersey as an easy victory. Republican leaders will have to decide whether to commit large resources to try to  defeat him, or focus on other, less costly races.</p>
        <p>For state Democratic leaders, plagued by a civil war along geographic lines, Mr. Corzine's was a smashing victory for the northern establishment over a faction led by George E. Norcross, a co-chairman of Mr. Florio's campaign and the de facto boss of Camden County.</p>
        <p>Despite that intraparty warfare, Mr. Corzine managed the improbable feat of uniting Senator Lautenberg and Senator Robert G. Torricelli behind his candidacy, even as he won the support of traditional constituencies like African-Americans. Among his supporters were the mayors of Trenton and Newark and prominent black ministers and state lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio carried his home base of Camden County by a 3-to-1 margin. But Mr. Corzine's hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to other county committees, made in the name of party building, and requited early on by crucial endorsements in the most populous areas, paid enormous dividends on Tuesday. Despite low turnouts across the state attributable to heavy rains, party workers delivered for Mr. Corzine in most other urban areas: in Essex, Hudson, Bergen, Union and Mercer Counties, he won by overwhelming majorities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's entry into the race as a self-financed candidate saved state Democratic leaders from having to raise as much as $10 million for a less wealthy Senate candidate. Now, his victory in the primary means they will be able to focus on the real prize of New Jersey politics: the governor's race in 2001.</p>
        <p>The Democratic outcome had rested on two uncertainties: whether voters would be persuaded or repulsed by the $35 million campaign of Mr. Corzine, and whether Jim Florio could overcome the lingering animosity of Democrats who still nursed grudges over the $2.8 billion tax increase he passed in 1990, fueling years of Republican victories.</p>
        <p>The four Republican contenders, bereft of widespread name recognition or overwhelming financial resources, were left to struggle in the shadows, relying for the most part on cheaper direct-mail attacks instead of television, and on the support of county and local Republican organizations whose loyalties had been sworn months ago.</p>
        <p>Among the four, Mr. Franks and Mr. Gormley were the leading contenders. A dark-horse candidate in the Republican primary was James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive. Also running was Murray Sabrin, an opponent of abortion rights and gun control who ran for governor as a Libertarian in 1997.</p>
        <p>Despite the heavy publicity surrounding the Democratic Senate race and the competitive Republican primaries, voter turnout was well below 1982 levels, the last time there was an open Senate seat, when 846,787 people voted. With 92 percent of districts reporting, the total vote for Senate candidates was 655,402.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company,  spent $2 million on Tuesday alone in get-out-the-vote efforts, from rain gear and rented vans to payments of $75 or more for his street workers. The previous record for a Senate primary was $8.1 million. Mr. Corzine also exceeded the nearly $30 million spent in vain by Michael Huffington in his California race for the United States Senate in 1994.</p>
        <p>The problem for Democrats was embodied by one couple at the public library in Westfield. ''I wasn't going to vote, but I'm opposed to someone who spends $36 million to buy an election,'' said Mark Rubin, an accountant voting there. ''Florio was an awful governor, but I voted for him because no one has a right to buy the election.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rubin's wife, Andi, said she could not bring herself to vote for Mr. Florio. She waited in the car.</p>
        <p>The four Republicans ran well below the radar screens of most voters in what was a far more typical primary for New Jersey, where political household names are scarce.</p>
        <p>Barring statewide appeal or an overwhelming financial advantage, the three moderates -- Mr. Gormley, Mr. Franks and Mr. Treffinger -- relied heavily on support from party stalwarts in their respective bases. Mr. Gormley, a champion of Atlantic City's casino industry, counted on a strong showing in South Jersey, particularly along the shore. Mr. Franks counted on above-average turnout in his Congressional district because of the competitive primary there, as well as in Burlington County to the south, where he was endorsed by the  Republican organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Treffinger, who positioned himself between the other two moderates and Mr. Sabrin, a onetime Libertarian also running in the Republican primary, hoped to score well in counties like Monmouth and Morris, where party officials had not endorsed a candidate, in addition to his base in Essex and neighboring Passaic and Hudson Counties. Mr. Sabrin held out hope that the three others would split the moderate vote, and that a strong turnout of opponents of gun control and abortion rights would give him a long shot victory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lautenberg's surprise decision in February 1999 to retire at the end of his term -- he said he did not want to spend the next two years raising money for re-election -- opened up a New Jersey Senate seat for the first time since he was first elected 18 years ago.</p>
        <p>Within the State Democratic Party, Mr. Florio's swift entry into the race set off a feverish search for a credible alternative to the former governor, as influential party leaders in the northern and central parts of the state believed he could not win a potential rematch with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, and feared having to defend Mr. Florio's fateful 1990 tax increase of $2.8 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, who had just been forced out of his job as co-chairman of Goldman Sachs when Mr. Lautenberg announced his retirement, surfaced as an answered prayer to those Democrats, among them Senator  Torricelli, who believed the only way to defeat Mr. Florio was with a great deal of money. When Goldman Sachs held an initial public stock offering in May 1999, Mr. Corzine received 4.4 million shares, and instantly became worth $400 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's candidacy emerged several months later as a rare combination: here was a Wall Street titan running as an unabashed liberal, with ambitious, expensive proposals for universal health care, long-term care for the elderly and disabled, and preschool programs, as well as free college tuition for any high school graduates with a B average. He adamantly opposed the death penalty and supported affirmative action, gay rights and mandatory licensing of guns and registration for gun owners.</p>
        <p>But it was Mr. Corzine's free-spending campaign that drew national attention to the race, beginning in March, when he began a 12-week advertising onslaught -- unheard of in New Jersey -- on television stations in New York and Philadelphia. After only eight weeks, Mr. Corzine, unknown to voters just a year earlier, had pulled ahead of Mr. Florio in both campaigns' internal polling.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Florio, one of only a few one-term governors in modern New Jersey history, his campaign quickly turned as combative as his three past races for governor. Mr. Florio, who was seen by many as running for his own vindication, relentlessly assailed Mr. Corzine as a political neophyte whose naivete could not compete with his own experience in state government and as an eight-term congressman. With a meager $2.5 million budget, Mr. Florio ran only attack commercials in the last two weeks of the race, and had to be pressed at times to articulate his own agenda.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Florio did little to deflect Mr. Corzine's attacks, which began on television in mid-April and remained unanswered for a month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio made inroads against Mr. Corzine with elderly voters by attacking Mr. Corzine for supporting a limited investment of the Social Security trust fund in the stock market, although Mr. Florio did so by disingenuously charging that Mr. Corzine's stand was the same as a Republican plan to privatize Social Security. But Mr. Florio stumbled  three weeks ago, when it was reported that he had expressed support for the same limited stock-market investment as recently as a year ago.</p>
        <p>In the last 10 days of the race, however, Mr. Florio received a lift from news coverage of Mr. Corzine's campaign spending and reports that Mr. Corzine had indirectly hired a private investigator to look into Mr. Florio's background.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey primary also featured three of the nation's most competitive Congressional races. In the Fifth District, Marge S. Roukema, a 20-year incumbent, clung to a narrow lead over E. Scott Garrett, a state assemblyman. With 99 percent of the vote counted, Mrs. Roukema, who beat Mr. Garrett by 1,710 votes two years ago, was maintaining nearly the same margin, 1,571 votes, or 52 percent to Mr. Garrett's 48.1 percent.</p>
        <p>In the 12th District, where two former congressmen fought a testy campaign for the Republican nomination, Richard A. Zimmer scored a convincing victory over Mike Pappas. With 100 percent of districts reporting, Mr. Zimmer had 62 percent of the vote to Mr. Pappas's 38 percent. The winner will face a freshman Democrat, Rush Holt, who two years ago defeated Mr. Pappas, who succeeded Mr. Zimmer in 1996 when Mr. Zimmer vacated his seat to run for Senate.</p>
        <p>In the Seventh District, with a crowded field of four Republicans and four Democrats, Michael Ferguson, a college instructor, defeated  Thomas Kean Jr., the former governor's son, and two other candidates. In the Democratic field, Maryanne Connelly and Michael J. Lapolla were almost tied at 45 percent each with 99 percent of the precincts reporting.</p>
