        <p>The government officials who monitor television news coverage could not believe what they saw on the screen.</p>
        <p>The occasion was a few weeks ago when the three leading presidential candidates were taunting each other in an unscripted, open-ended sparring match. One national network gleefully dropped what it was showing to carry the war of words live. Not to be outdone, the other big network followed suit. Viewers had a look at the raw insides of Mexican politics, and there was not a thing the government's media managers could do to stop it.</p>
        <p>As recently as 1994, in Mexico's last presidential vote, the message that the powerful broadcast media conveyed was largely determined by the government. But since then, reforms have opened new freedoms for the press, while the competition for viewers between the two main television networks, Televisa and TV Azteca, has intensified to a fury.</p>
        <p>This year, in the race leading to July 2 elections, the most important broadcasters are no longer driven by the need to please President Ernesto Zedillo or his Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has won every presidential election in seven decades. Instead, the race for ratings is defining campaign coverage as never before.</p>
        <p>The biggest change was at Televisa, Mexico's largest broadcast network. For decades the government gave Televisa a virtual monopoly on television, and the company repaid the favor with unflagging loyalty to the ruling party, which is known by its Spanish initials, PRI.</p>
        <p>In 1997 Emilio Azcarraga Jean, the young scion of the family that controls Televisa, took over the $9 billion conglomerate at his father's death. By that time its rival TV Azteca was four years old and had dug a hole in its audience.</p>
        <p>To stay ahead of the upstart, Mr. Azcarraga believed he had to cater to viewers, not authorities. He decided that rekindling Mexicans' waning faith in Televisa's news programs was the way to do it.</p>
        <p>''We have been recreating our credibility,'' Mr. Azcarraga, 32, said in an interview in which he was anxious to show that Televisa is ready to handle a modern media-dominated presidential contest. ''Whatever arrogance existed here before is finished. It is clear to me that improving the image of our news shows helps to bring up our ratings across the board.''</p>
        <p>The ratings war surprisingly made the news less lively. Viewers were so weary of years of tendentious political news that they wanted balanced reporting even if it was dull. Both Televisa and TV Azteca have adopted a discipline of giving the three leading candidates the same amount of time, no matter how humdrum their activities that day.</p>
        <p>''My concern is to get the imbalance down to zero,'' Mr. Azcarraga said.</p>
        <p>It seems to have worked. In a report early this month the Federal Elections Institute, a government agency that operates with autonomy, and which scrutinizes the campaign coverage in the broadcast media second by second, reported that Televisa was fair in covering the race. In fact, Televisa devoted almost exactly the same amounts of coverage to the three leaders in the race: Francisco Labastida Ochoa of the PRI, Vicente Fox Quesada of the National Action Party and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano of the Party of the Democratic Revolution.</p>
        <p>The network insurgent, TV Azteca, is quicker to let its political passions show if it makes for catchy news. The network has engaged in a nasty feud with the authorities in Mexico City because of the district attorney's investigation of the slaying of Francisco Stanley, a TV Azteca comedian who the police say was tangled in the cocaine trade. The capital is governed by Mr. Cardenas' party, and officials in his campaign said that TV Azteca frequently vents its ire against their candidate.</p>
        <p>''Cuauhtemoc is a permanent target of their attacks,'' said Imanol Ordorika, the campaign spokesman for Mr. Cardenas, who is running a distant third in the race.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile Mr. Cardenas, who was either ignored or insulted by Televisa when he ran for president in 1988 and 1994, has had an improbable reconciliation with that network, especially the top news anchorman, Joaquin Lopez Doriga.</p>
        <p>In the media nationwide, the elections agency found, there is a bias sharply in favor of Mr. Labastida of the PRI going in to the final stretch of the campaign. The national networks were counteracted by powerful prejudices at local television and radio stations over which they have at best limited control. The elections agency discovered that the local media leaned toward the party holding local power, and PRI governors control two-thirds of Mexico's states.</p>
        <p>For the big broadcasters, outside pressures to tilt their coverage has not diminished. But by and large it no longer comes from the president and his press handlers.</p>
        <p>''I can say that we are not generally pressured by the government to cover the PRI candidate more favorably,'' said Sergio Sarmiento, a top journalist at TV Azteca. ''Now the pressure is coming from the parties.  The PRI is still more ominous, because they've been in power so long they feel they can always tell the media what to put on the air. What is new this year is that the media can say no.''</p>
        <p>The man who calls the press from Mr. Labastida's campaign is Emilio Gamboa Patron, a veteran in the arts of persuasion who derives clout from the years when he was communications minister and administered the federal concessions Mexican television networks need to operate.</p>
        <p>On another side is Martha Sahagun, Mr. Fox's largely self-taught spokeswoman who is known among news directors for the speed with which she responds to news about her candidate with a flurry of cellular phone calls.</p>
        <p>But even the mostly quiet officials in Mr. Zedillo's government were at last moved to alarmed action when the full force of the networks' rivalry was on view during the two-hour quarrel between the candidates on live television, on May 23.</p>
        <p>The night before, Televisa had won a scoop by having the three contenders on together in an impromptu debate.</p>
        <p>So the next day, when the cameras were trained live on the three scowling men when they met again to discuss whether to have a formal debate, TV Azteca jumped in to show the scene live. Mr. Fox suggested having the debate that same night, and TV Azteca quickly agreed.</p>
        <p>Televisa quickly tried to stop that idea. It sided with Mr. Labastida and Mr. Cardenas, who sought to delay the formal face-off. Mr. Azcarraga was not about to carry a debate put together by his competitor.</p>
        <p>At that point, officials at the Interior Ministry and the PRI, watching the political process slip completely out of their hands, deluged executives at TV Azteca with calls insisting that they shut off the live coverage and deny Mr. Fox further air time that night.</p>
        <p>''We were not following the rules,'' said Mr. Sarmiento, who fielded some of the calls. ''We were accused of favoring one of the candidates. But we went ahead to conduct the interview with Fox that we were asked not to. I was happy that we had the courage to do it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Azcarraga said that despite the side he took in that dispute, Televisa is not backing any candidate.</p>
        <p>''I'm with whoever wins,'' Mr. Azcarraga said. ''What I believe in is democracy. Because -- and I've said it many times -- democracy is very, very good business.''</p>
