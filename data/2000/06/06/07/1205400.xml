        <p>Armed with French whimsy and a homemade arsenal of its own, Britain made the Ojai Festival last weekend its newest incursion into American culture. Ravel, Poulenc, Mark-Anthony Turnage and Thomas Ades were the unlikely allies. Sir Simon Rattle presided over the Los Angeles Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>Equally unlikely was the field of combat: an Eden-like valley northeast of Los Angeles where music out of doors is sheltered by eucalyptus and live oak, surrounded by hydrangeas the size of soccer balls and infused with the intermittent smell of honeysuckle and jasmine.</p>
        <p>Ravel's ''Enfant et les Sortileges'' on Friday and Poulenc's ''Mamelles de Tiresias'' on Sunday explored the possibilities of coyness and absurdity, respectively. Both are brief operas from the second quarter of the last century and were given here in concert form. Mr. Turnage and Mr. Ades, whose pieces were sprinkled over the weekend, are promising British composers who share youth but not much else.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turnage worships at the feet of jazz and cultivates a certain rawness in his music. ''Blood on the Floor'' at Libbey Bowl on Saturday night commented fulsomely in nine long movements on the unhappinesses of drug addiction. ''Kai'' on Friday worked Ben Hong's soulful solo cello against aggressive popular music elements (saxophones, bass guitar). Mr. Turnage makes a quick impression on audiences. The popular elements loosen their inhibitions; the drama is up-front and nigh impossible to misread.</p>
        <p>''Blood on the Floor'' sounded most authentic when it let the drummer Peter Erskine go his own way. To love jazz and to copy its moves is not necessarily to grasp its spirit. Mr. Turnage's gestures sound accurate to me but secondhand. There are also problems of management, something ''Blood on the Floor'' could use more of. The courage to discard is essential, but this composer is something of a pack rat. Reducing this piece in length and Roto-Rooting through its often clotted textures might have made us believe in a creator truly in control of his materials.</p>
        <p>Setting Mr. Turnage beside Mr. Ades's pieces did put him at a disadvantage. Mr. Turnage tells us what we already know in interesting ways. Mr. Ades's astonishing orchestra piece ''Asyla'' on Friday night conveyed listeners into a world they hadn't really imagined. The dull, unhurried clank of cowbells, the icy violin harmonics, the high trumpet parts, the changeability of meter, even the liquid Romantic sweep of string sections are recognizable fragments of history but newly subverted and bathed in a different kind of light. The briefer orchestra piece, ''These Premises Are Alarmed,'' on Sunday hovered in the treble, where Mr. Ades seems quite comfortable, and was touched as well with bright, distinctive colors.</p>
        <p>Delicacy and altitude, indeed, were common denominators for a lot of the weekend's music. Gloria Cheng's interesting piano recital on Saturday afternoon, including two Ades pieces, spent much of its time in the instrument's higher registers, filling them with repetitive shudders and filigree. There were exceptions: the remorseless brightness and hard geometry of Boulez's ''Incise,'' and ''The Art of Touching the Keyboard'' by Judith Weir with its small, abrupt gestures and active silences. Jonathan Harvey's ''Tombeau de Messiaen'' paid homage with its descending chord patterns and marchlike movement and used taped sound in skewed tunings as extensions of the piano's possibilities.</p>
        <p>Gracefully managed was Messiaen himself, especially the six bird-song sketches, ''Petites Esquisses d'Oiseaux.'' The real things were chirping in the branches above Ms. Cheng, making sure that we heard the differences between them and manmade copies. Indeed, so different are birds in sound frequency, weight and tuning from the piano that these exquisite pieces seemed less bird song than poems by humans on listening to bird song.</p>
        <p>Setting aside Naomi Sekiya's busy, pounding potboiler on Saturday night (''Deluge'' with the pianist Vicki Ray) and Mr. Turnage's general tough-guy attitude, this was a weekend unusually sensitive to the sheer pleasures of hearing music. The Ravel and Poulenc pieces have no other purpose than to endear, a policy that made them anomalies next to the confrontation, hostility and obscurantism of their colleagues and contemporaries. At Ojai both Frenchmen fit right in. Mr. Ades is startlingly original, but he seems to care about listeners. So does Mr. Turnage.</p>
        <p>''L'Enfant et les Sortileges'' teeters between inspired whimsy and preciosity; the Poulenc (I could hear only half of it on Sunday) almost invites the editorial wink and the oversold joke. The Ojai singers wisely avoided both tactics. Heidi Grant Murphy, Rinat Shaham, Marietta Simpson, Francois Le Roux, Cynthia Clarey, John Aler, Julian Rodescu, Christine Brandes and Thomas Young sang handsomely and handled humor deftly. At the end of a testing three days, Sir Simon's final patriotic note was Britten's ''Four Sea Interludes'' from ''Peter Grimes.'' Their exceptional originality and beauty, so passionately expressed, pointed directly to ''Asyla'' and to whatever discoveries Mr. Ades has for us next.</p>
