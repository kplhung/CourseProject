        <p>FOR a long time, the image of the typical Internet user was a heterosexual white male younger than 40. Although this characterization was mostly true, the Web is now becoming a thriving marketplace for a wider range of people.</p>

        <p>FOR a long time, the image of the typical Internet user was a heterosexual white male younger than 40. Although this characterization was mostly true, the Web is now becoming a thriving marketplace for a wider range of people.</p>
        <p>As the economic and political influence of Asian-Americans, Hispanics, African-Americans and gay men and lesbians increases, so does their presence on the Web. Technology is also allowing millions of people with disabilities to go online. Not surprisingly, a growing number of sites are serving these communities as they contour the Web to their own needs.</p>
        <p>The Asian-American community is wired, with a full 69 percent of Asian-American households connected to the Internet. This is reflected in the many sites aimed at this community, including www.aonline.com, a site focusing on culture and lifestyle for Asian-Americans, produced by A Magazine. Another site, www.Click2Asia.com, links to shopping, business and travel in the United States, Japan, Taiwan and Korea.</p>
        <p>For the Hispanic market, the site www.zonafinanciera.com provides banking, insurance, auto and real-estate services in English, Spanish and Portuguese in 21 countries. ''Many Hispanics are looking for convenient ways to send money home, secure a loan for a family member in Latin America or buy stock or property there,'' said Greg Keough, a co-founder of the site.</p>
        <p>The site www.starmedia.com is a huge portal that includes shopping in Spanish, travel services, news from the Americas, classified advertising and chat rooms.</p>
        <p>African-Americans are the fastest-growing group online. ''Blacks are always on the tail end of technology, and we need to get on the front end,'' said Harry Alford, the president and chief executive of the National Black Chamber of Commerce. Its site, www.nationalbcc.com, offers members discounts from major corporations and other benefits. Other sites, like www.blackplanet .com, will soon offer college databases, financial tools and technology classes, said Omar Wasow, the executive director.</p>
        <p>For people with disabilities, the Internet offers perhaps the greatest promise. With www.wemedia.com, ''for the first time, a homebound individual can visit the grocery store, stop at the bank and pick up a new shirt,'' said Mikki Lam, a senior vice president of WEmedia Inc. The site also offers health assistance and information about finances, education and sports.</p>
        <p>For gay men and lesbians, two large portals, www.gay.com and www.planetout .com, offer chat; personal ads; shopping; information on living with H.I.V.; investment tools; news; and links to gay-owned companies. ''Gay commerce takes a different angle online,'' said Megan Smith, Planetout's chief executive. ''We're a large community with specific needs. It's a completely underserved market.''</p>
