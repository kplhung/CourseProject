        <p>In a race that mirrored one two years ago, Representative Marge S. Roukema fought off her persistent challenger, State Assemblyman E. Scott Garrett, and narrowly defeated him.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mr. Garrett came close to beating Mrs. Roukema, who has served in Congress for 20 years. This time around, he waged a better-financed campaign, with the support of a conservative Washington-based group called the Club for Growth, whose members were critical of Mrs. Roukema's moderate stands on abortion rights, welfare reform and tax issues. The group's leaders had vowed to send a message to other Republican moderates in Congress.</p>
        <p>Primaries in Mrs. Roukema's Congressional district and two others in New Jersey were hard fought and closely watched, reflecting the national attention focused on a small number of volatile districts that could tip the balance of power in the House, where Republicans have a narrow majority.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Roukema, the only incumbent who faced a primary challenge in the New Jersey elections, gathered her supporters at the Sheraton Crossroads in Mahwah tonight and declared victory. ''The message here is that our Republican Party has got to pull together to start beating the Democrats, and not listen to some outside group who comes in trying to tell us what to do,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She had noted earlier that single-issue voters, like those who oppose abortion, make a difference in an election that has low voter interest overall, as this one did.</p>
        <p>''This shows us that the people who have litmus tests'' on issues like abortions and gun control ''get to the polls in large numbers,'' she said, ''and as much as we try to energize others to get to the polls, people are a little more casual about some of the other issues.''</p>
        <p>With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, unofficial returns showed Mrs. Roukema with 22,380 votes, or 52 percent, and Mr. Garrett with 20,729, or 48 percent, according to The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>In another closely watched Congressional race, Richard A. Zimmer handily beat Mike Pappas to win the Republican race for the 12th District in New Jersey, a seat both men had held.</p>
        <p>With all the precincts reporting, Mr. Zimmer received 18,116 votes, or 62 percent, to Mr. Pappas's 11,208 votes, or 38 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zimmer, 55, will now face the incumbent, Rush Holt, a Democrat, in the November general election, in what promises to be one of the most hotly contested House elections in the nation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zimmer said he had succeeded in defeating his Republican opponent by putting together ''a coalition of moderates and conservatives that included all five counties'' in his district. ''I think the voters saw me as generally reflecting their views, and being able to take the seat back for the Republican Party,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The seat in the 12th District had been Republican for decades, until Mr. Pappas lost it to Mr. Holt in 1998. In 1996 Mr. Pappas, a conservative, gained nationwide notoriety when he stood up on the House floor to honor Kenneth W. Starr -- who was prosecuting President Clinton for impeachment -- by singing ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.''</p>
        <p>The Seventh District contests in suburban Union and Somerset Counties were hard fought as well. The seat became vacant when Representative Robert D. Franks decided to run for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>With nearly all of the precincts reporting, Michael Ferguson had 41 percent of the votes, leading the field of four candidates. He defeated Thomas H. Kean Jr. -- the son of the former governor -- who received 28 percent. Joel M. Weingarten, a state assemblyman making a second run for Congress, received 23 percent of the votes and Patrick Morrissey, a conservative former House staff member, received 9 percent.</p>
        <p>As the last precincts reported, the Democratic primary was too close to call. Maryanne Connelly, a former mayor of Fanwood who ran well against Mr. Franks in 1998, received 14,224 votes, or 45 percent. Michael J. Lapolla, the Union County manager,  received 14,030 votes.</p>
        <p>Also defeated were Joel Farley, a Westfield lawyer, and Jeffrey Golkin, a township committee member in Warren.</p>
        <p>The inclement weather throughout the state kept most voters away from the polls in an election to which they had been paying scant attention in any case. Voting was sparse as well in the Fifth District, where Mrs. Roukema had waged one of the toughest fights of her career.</p>
        <p>The district in northern New Jersey, which reaches from the Delaware River to the New York border, includes some rural areas that are rapidly becoming suburbanized. The views of Mrs. Roukema, 70, have been more reflective of the part of her district that is in Bergen County, which is more moderate. She is for abortion rights, she resisted some of the harsher aspects of welfare reform, and she sponsored the Family and Medical Leave Act.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garrett, 40, has been an assemblyman since 1990. He is against abortion and advocates a flat tax.</p>
        <p>In the general election, Mrs. Roukema will face Linda Mercurio, a Democrat, who had no primary opponent.</p>
        <p>In the District 12 race, Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Pappas waged a vociferous campaign that turned acrid.  Mr. Zimmer, who was supported by the Republican establishment, had held the 12th District Congressional seat until he resigned in 1996 to wage an unsuccessful Senate bid against Robert G. Torricelli.</p>
        <p>He is for gun control and abortion rights, although he recently switched his position on the late-term abortion procedure that critics call partial-birth abortion, which he now opposes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pappas earned a 100 percent voting-record rating from the Christian Coalition. He still speaks proudly of his vote to impeach Mr. Clinton, even though some say his singing performance lost him the election to Mr. Holt.</p>
        <p>Voters in their district, which includes a swath of some of the state's wealthiest suburbs, seemed driven more by their views on fiscal issues or abortion than on what Mr. Pappas said was the negative advertising his opponent waged.</p>
        <p>''Pappas is too conservative,'' said Kimberly Martino, who had cast her vote for Mr. Zimmer at Hunterdon Regional High School. ''I don't like his stand on abortion.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Lisa Nettleship, who teaches her children at home, said she had voted for Mr. Pappas, and added that Mr. Zimmer ''didn't seem to mind spending money on liberal social issues.''</p>
