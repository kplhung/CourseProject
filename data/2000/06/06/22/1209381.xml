      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Texas Instruments Inc., the semiconductor giant, said yesterday that it would acquire the Burr-Brown Corporation, which is also a computer chip maker, for $7.6 billion in stock.</p>
        <p>Burr-Brown is a leader in analog chips, as is Texas Instruments, but the two companies' product lines are complementary rather than overlapping in most areas.</p>
        <p>In the deal, which was announced after trading closed yesterday, Texas Instruments said it would issue 1.3 shares of its stock for each share of Burr-Brown. That $113.425-a-share offer represents a 50 percent premium for Burr-Brown over its closing price on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Texas Instruments shares closed down $2.875, to $84, on the New York Stock Exchange. Burr-Brown closed yesterday at $72.625, down $2.75, in Nasdaq trading. In after-hours trading, Burr-Brown shares surged to as high as $102.9375, while Texas Instruments shares were flat.</p>
        <p>The digital revolution has actually proved a boon to the makers of analog chips, devices that process continuous electronic signals rather than ones and zeros. This is because humans cannot see or hear digital code, so analog chips have to step in to convert digital signals into usable form for things like computer monitor displays and speakers. Digital cell phones, DVD players and DSL modems all use analog chips.</p>
        <p>Buying Burr-Brown strengthens Texas Instruments's position in the data converter and amplifier segments of the analog semiconductor market, where it has little or no market share. Data converters are analog semiconductors used to convert signals from analog to digital and back again. Amplifiers detect and strengthen low-level signals.</p>
        <p>Texas Instruments, which is based in Dallas, is primarily strong in digital signal processors, or D.S.P.'s, specialized chips often used in conjunction with analog circuits.</p>
        <p>''We are as serious about analog as we are about D.S.P.,'' Tom Engibous, the chairman, president and chief executive of Texas Instruments, said in a conference call with analysts.</p>
        <p>''The people of Burr-Brown are elite developers of high-performance analog products,'' Mr. Engibous said. ''This combination means that T.I. will have a leading position in essentially every high-performance analog category and the ability to offer almost any analog component that touches a D.S.P.''</p>
        <p>Burr-Brown will become part of Texas Instruments's organization devoted to catalog analog semiconductors, which are off-the-shelf parts used in many products. This is the third acquisition by Texas Instruments in the last 12 months to expand in this area. Last October it acquired the Unitrode Corporation, which makes chips that extend a cell phone's battery life, for $1.25 billion in stock. In November, it bought Power Trends, a maker of circuit board devices, for $145 million in stock.</p>
        <p>''Texas Instruments' strength in D.S.P. will introduce our high-performance analog and data converter products into new applications,'' said Syrus Madavi, Burr-Brown's chairman, president and chief executive. ''The makers of Internet appliances and communications systems will have the best of both worlds in one company, with complementary components to optimally meet their total signal processing requirements,'' he said in the conference call.</p>
        <p>Texas Instruments executives said they planned to retain Burr-Brown's headquarters and one manufacturing site in Tucson, Ariz., as well as two technology development centers in Atsugi, Japan, and Livingston, Scotland. They also intend to keep Burr-Brown's 1,500 employees.</p>
        <p>Producing analog chips costs less than making digital ones, because analog chips do not require -- and often cannot use -- the latest process technology. One reason is that packing circuits ever closer together, which increases the speed of digital chips, only causes noise and heat problems for analog ones.</p>
        <p>Analog chip design is still as much art as science, and benefits little from modern computer-aided design software. So analog companies are dependent on design power of the human kind, engineers with years of experience. Because these experts are hard to come by, the barrier to entry in the analog business is surprisingly high.</p>
