        <p>JUST outside the door of my writing room here in Hollywood there is a collage of snapshots my mother put together for a family reunion some years back. There's a photo of me in my high school R.O.T.C. drill-team uniform, and one of my brother Frank splitting wood.</p>
        <p>But the snapshot that catches my eye every time I walk by was taken when I was about 6 and Frank was 4. We're asleep on a couple of cots on my grandparents' sleeping porch, sheets thrown back exposing our scrawny little bodies, the fetid darkness of a summer night in Washington, D.C., visible through the screened walls of the porch. We spent every summer sleeping on a screen porch in those days, when air-conditioning was an exclusive feature of the movie theater downtown, nowhere in evidence in our home or the homes of anyone we knew.</p>

        <p>JUST outside the door of my writing room here in Hollywood there is a collage of snapshots my mother put together for a family reunion some years back. There's a photo of me in my high school R.O.T.C. drill-team uniform, and one of my brother Frank splitting wood.</p>
        <p>But the snapshot that catches my eye every time I walk by was taken when I was about 6 and Frank was 4. We're asleep on a couple of cots on my grandparents' sleeping porch, sheets thrown back exposing our scrawny little bodies, the fetid darkness of a summer night in Washington, D.C., visible through the screened walls of the porch. We spent every summer sleeping on a screen porch in those days, when air-conditioning was an exclusive feature of the movie theater downtown, nowhere in evidence in our home or the homes of anyone we knew.</p>
        <p>The sleeping porch was something we looked forward to, when the heat and humidity would finally build to the point that the cots would be dragged out and once again we'd be exposed to the elements -- cooled, if only slightly, by an itinerant breeze, sung to sleep by the insistent nighttime chatter of cicadas.</p>
        <p>The best nights were the ones when a sudden thunderstorm would blow through, and our father or grandfather would lower the outside shutters. We'd move our cots back against the wall of the house, and the wind would whistle through the screens, and the rain, if it blew hard enough, would come horizontally through the shutters, and you felt like you were on a ship somewhere at sea, taking water over the bow. After the second or third storm of the summer, the excitement would wane, and we would awake in the morning to find that our beds had been moved and the shutters lowered while we remained asleep. When my wife and I bought a 1921 house in Hollywood a few years ago, the last room our real estate agent showed us was at the end of the house, above what had been the servants' quarters. As we walked up the backstairs into the rather long and narrow room, the real estate agent said in defense of the peculiar space, ''Now this room has a very interesting history.''</p>
        <p>I felt the slant in the floor, picked up the corner of a seriously deteriorated carpet, and sure enough, the flooring was tin covered in canvas, necessary to allow the rain to run off. A sleeping porch had been enclosed at some point in the past.</p>
        <p>One of these days we'll save up the money and file for the permits and take out the exterior walls and find some place that has still got good quality copper screening, and we'll return the old room at the west end of the house to its rightful incarnation, and we'll let our 6-year-old daughter, Lilly, have some friends for a sleepover. We'll tuck them in and pray for rain.</p>
