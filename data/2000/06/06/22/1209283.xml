        <p>NEW YORKERS are mad about real estate. So are Californians. Texans, too.</p>
        <p>Boiling mad.</p>
        <p>Clive Kandel, 49, a costume jewelry designer in Manhattan, is furious: no more apartment hunting. He is fed up with facing one obstacle after another in a month of searching, in which all he found were one-bedroom apartments that start at $400,000, garbage-strewn backyards and brokers he described as arrogant and unhelpful. ''You feel you have no allies,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Dallas, Steve Cowan, 41, a hospital technician with two children, angrily called his yearlong search ''a never-ending battle.'' He thought he could find a house for $150,000 in the neighborhood where his wife, Anne, grew up. But now, he said, ''prices keep getting jacked up to the point where people who work real hard can't touch the house they want.''</p>
        <p>And in Oakland, Calif., Kevin Griffith, who works for a developer of moderate-income housing, has been looking for a ''not very extravagant 1920's bungalow -- two bedrooms, one bath on a 3,000-square-foot lot.'' He and his wife have lost five bidding wars since April 1. They started looking in 1998, but dropped out six months later because brokers told them the market was cooling. Now, Mr. Griffith said ruefully, they would be forced to pay $100,000 more for bungalows they looked at then. ''Now they tell me the market may be cooling again, but the house I wanted last week had 10 offers on it!''</p>
        <p>After eight years of relentless price escalation, angry customers are slamming down phones, brokers said, and picking pointless fights with sellers. They are even stalking out of negotiations.</p>
        <p>Road rage, take a back seat. Make way for real estate rage. See that page of glossy real estate ads -- with nothing less than $800,000? Just lost your third bidding war? Join the crowd. House hunters are suffering from battle fatigue brought on by the highest real estate prices in history.</p>
        <p>Although the National Association of Realtors reported that home sales in April were down 6 percent from March, prices are continuing to rise, said Walter Molony, a spokesman for the trade association. And competition in the country's hottest markets, like Silicon Valley, Dallas and Manhattan, is still hot enough to ignite bidding wars.</p>
        <p>The number of frustrated shoppers -- at all income levels -- is growing, real estate brokers said. For house hunters like Mr. Griffith, 33, and his wife, Adrienne Oberstein, 34, their inability to find a home is serious: Ms. Oberstein is pregnant, and the one-bedroom apartment that they are renting is too small.</p>
        <p>So what do you do if you are feeling powerless? One man spends his Sundays tearing the real estate ads into very long pieces. Others focus their ire on the sellers, branding them as greedy and dishonest. Still others have turned on their brokers, saying these bearers of bad news have betrayed them.</p>
        <p>Some even vent their frustration by the hour -- on the therapist's couch -- one place they know someone will listen.</p>
        <p>''Increasingly, I'm hearing, 'I followed all the rules,' '' said Dr. Mark Levy, a psychiatrist in San Francisco, where median sales prices have gone up 25 percent in 12 months to $365,300, according to the National Association of Realtors. '' 'I got 100 graduate school degreees, and why can't I buy the house I think I should have?' ''</p>
        <p>One patient told Dr. Levy he watched ''an already inflated house shoot up to $2.6 million in 10 hours and then sold to some 30-year-old dot-com guy.'' Dr. Levy added: ''There's a lot of self-blame: What did I do wrong? How stupid was I?''</p>
        <p>Dr. Dave Davis, a psychiatrist in Atlanta, where real estate agents said house values in the most expensive neighborhoods had doubled in five years, said real estate rage ''is a terrific problem -- just about every day, one of my patients brings it up.''</p>
        <p>And although heartbreak happens in every income bracket these days, real estate agents and therapists agree: the people who yell the loudest are usually those with the most money.</p>
        <p>Dr. Davis has no problem identifying. He lives -- and works -- in Buckhead, one of Atlanta's fanciest suburbs, and his clientele includes lots of wealthy men and women in their 50's.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of anger, a lot of disappointment here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Dallas, where prices are up at least 15 percent in the best neighborhoods since the spring of 1999, Dr. Mark Unterberg says home buyers are not exactly angry: they are despairing. ''Envy is also a good word,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In New York, Dr. Gail Saltz, an instructor in psychiatry at New York Presbyterian Hospital, said her patients ''are certainly outraged and disgusted and freaked out'' by New York City prices, where the average apartment just hit $700,000.</p>
        <p>''They can't believe the market keeps going up,'' she said. ''They have a presumption about certain basic things they can expect in life.''</p>
        <p>An inability to afford that Park Avenue condo, she said, can lead to distress. ''They see a multimillion-dollar asking price they can't afford,'' she said. ''They feel like losers. Here you are making a pretty good salary, but in this crazy situation you can't compete.''</p>
        <p>''After all, what are the most exciting things in life?'' she said. ''Sex? Paying incredible amounts of money for real estate? If you can't have the first, the second fills a lot of fantasy lives.''</p>
        <p>But even before they take their anger to the therapist, embittered house and apartment hunters often take it to the broker, who is usually the bearer of bad tidings: Outbid again! Turned down by the co-op board. The sellers accepted your offer and then reneged after they got a higher one. Or the simplest of all: Sorry, you can't possibly afford what you think you should have.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of rage right now,'' said Diane Waller, a real estate agent in Manhattan. ''People's homes are such emotionally charged issues in the first place. It really is enraging to be out there and keep missing.''</p>
        <p>The agents are angry, too. ''After all, we're out the commission,'' said Frank Newbold, manager of the East Hampton, N.Y., office of Sotheby's International Real Estate. ''We don't get paid when a deal falls through.'' He said he spends hours counseling angry millionaires.</p>
        <p>''I tell them it isn't a car crash, it isn't cancer,'' he said. ''I tell them to get some perspective.''</p>
        <p>The tendency is to find someone to blame. ''It's never your own fault,'' said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate in New York. ''So you've got to slap the underling. You've got to slap the broker around.''</p>
        <p>Bad behavior is rife right now -- especially among those unaccustomed to hearing no. ''They went to Harvard Business School, and they're making a starting salary of $175,000, and they think they're little masters of the universe,'' said Clark Halstead, head of the Halstead Property Company in Manhattan. ''But guess what? With that salary, they might be able to afford a studio!''</p>
        <p>Sounding like a psychotherapist himself, Mr. Halstead said the run-of-the-mill bonus baby, faced with the Manhattan market, first feels ''outrageous denial.'' This is followed, he continued, by ''a quieter resignation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kandel, who has his own jewelry boutique at Bergdorf Goodman, blames the brokers, not for the market's being so high, but for their attitude. ''It makes me furious,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Agents made him feel ''they don't want to bother with you unless you have a spare million you want to spend,'' he said, adding: ''Then their attitude is: Well, of course it's not perfect. This is New York. If you don't want it, somebody else does.''</p>
        <p>Although he enlisted the broker, Mr. Kandel, like so many before him, complained that the broker legally  represents the seller. ''They're always watching you for your reaction,'' he said. ''They show you places with garbage strewn all over, and if you react negatively, that's it -- they never show you anything else. It gives you a feeling of hopelessness.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kandel said he saw his last apartment on June 5. ''I'm not looking again,'' he said indignantly, sitting behind his polished mahogany desk in his spacious corner office on Madison Avenue. ''I'm following the advice of the people who say the market will go down, and I should just wait.''</p>
        <p>Like John R. Mugno, a patent lawyer, who has vowed never to get into another bidding war after he was outbid on two two-bedroom apartments in pre-World War II buildings on the Upper West Side.</p>
        <p>''It turns into an auction,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mugno, who is renting a one-bedroom apartment in Maspeth, Queens, is still looking.</p>
        <p>''Most of the places you find, you'd better have a good contractor all lined up,'' he said. ''Most of the places are hardly in move-in condition. The bathrooms are . . . '' He shivered. ''Uninhabitable.''</p>
        <p>He paused. ''Yet, I've considered them.''</p>
        <p>And what do the psychotherapists tell all these would-be property owners, these frustrated masters of the half acre they would like to survey?</p>
        <p>''I tell them that's life,'' said Dr. Davis of Atlanta. ''Life's not fair. Just like in high school, not everybody could have the best-looking girlfriend or the most expensive car. They've got to get centered.''</p>
