        <p>President Laurent Kabila of Congo said today that he was shutting down an effort by the Organization of African Unity to open a political discourse among warring factions in Congo and banning the group's mediator because he had openly criticized the government.</p>
        <p>The Kinshasa offices of the mediator, Sir Ketumile Masire, a former president of Botswana, were sealed and his staff dispersed, Mr. Kabila said.

        <p>President Laurent Kabila of Congo said today that he was shutting down an effort by the Organization of African Unity to open a political discourse among warring factions in Congo and banning the group's mediator because he had openly criticized the government.</p>
        <p>The Kinshasa offices of the mediator, Sir Ketumile Masire, a former president of Botswana, were sealed and his staff dispersed, Mr. Kabila said. The move sets back hopes in the Security Council that a political discussion among the Congo factions could take place simultaneously with efforts to disarm them and prepare the way for a United Nations peacekeeping mission.</p>
        <p>The State Department called Mr. Kabila's actions a ''clear violation'' of a 1999 peace agreement and said that they ''undermine prospects for regional peace and development.'' It called on Congo to permit the immediate reopening of the office and to cooperate fully with the effort to start a dialogue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kabila made his statements in a telephone interview from Kinshasa, the country's capital. While he was critical of the efforts to start talks to end the civil war, Mr. Kabila was surprisingly hopeful that he and President Paul Kagame of Rwanda -- allies until the Rwandans invaded Congo in 1998 -- could work out a peace deal between them. Ten days ago, the two men met for the first time in more than two years at the Kenyan hill town of Eldoret.</p>
        <p>''With Mr. Kagame I think we can find a solution to the problem of the war,'' Mr. Kabila said. ''If he's serious. If he will recognize the mistakes he made by invading the Congo. He seems to have interest in really discussing peace with us. This was my impression. I believe he was sincere. But we shall see.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kabila was dismissive, however, of President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, whose troops are also part of the conflict in Congo. He said the Ugandans had no higher aim than to loot the country.</p>
        <p>The current phase of fighting in Congo began a year after Mr. Kabila, with Rwanda's help, took power in 1997 after leading a rebellion that overthrew Mobutu Sese Seko, whose long dictatorship had bled the country dry. Since then, fighting has involved the armies of six African nations and several rebel groups.</p>
        <p>In talking about Mr. Masire's ill-fated political mission, Mr. Kabila showed his abiding irritation with South Africa, which he said has long been a friend of his enemies. It was a remark that Mr. Masire made on a South African radio program that incensed the Congolese more than anything, the president said.</p>
        <p>''His statement, openly on South African Broadcasting Corporation, that he will go with the internal dialogue with or without Kabila -- that created the maximum point of discord,'' the president said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kabila said he had written to the Organization of African Unity asking them to find a replacement for Mr. Masire who would be impartial and, moreover, could speak French. The organization is responsible under the 1999 Lusaka peace accord on Congo for providing a ''facilitator'' for political talks.</p>
        <p>''Masire made speeches everywhere against the government,'' Mr. Kabila said in the interview, which was arranged through his American public relations adviser, John Aycoth, who was in Kinshasa. ''He has an agenda very, very contrary to what we have been believing he would be. We have decided that never will he be accepted here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kabila said, however, that he had no problems with United Nations officials in Kinshasa. He explained a mob attack last week on the United Nations headquarters in Congo as the work of disaffected easterners displaced by war who had heard about fighting in the eastern city of Kisangani and thought the United Nations should be doing something about it. United Nations officials said they saw the attack as a reminder of how volatile Congo is and how bad Mr. Kabila's relations with the outside world have generally been.</p>
        <p>Last month, a group of Security Council members, led by Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke of the United States, visited Congo as fighting between Ugandans and Rwandans flared in Kisangani. The ambassadors negotiated a promise from both the Rwandan and Ugandan leaders to withdraw their troops from Kisangani, creating a neutral city of about three million people where the United Nations could deploy its first peacekeepers -- and perhaps find a base for the discussion everyone hoped would soon begin.</p>
        <p>President Kabila said he had no objections to the plan as long as his government's sovereignty over Kisangani was recognized. But he asked why the United Nations was thinking of sending a South African battalion to the city.</p>
        <p>''We need other troops we can not suspect of being friends to the aggressor,'' he said. ''That is the problem with the South Africans. The South Africans have been assisting the other side since the beginning of the war. I think the world is very wide. Why can't they find other troops?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kabila was skeptical about reports that Ugandans and Rwandans were withdrawing from Kisangani, which would make a United Nations move into the town more urgent.</p>
        <p>Relations between the United States and Congo remain cool. Mr. Kabila accused Washington of blocking disbursements from a $50 million World Bank trust fund, even if the money were to go strictly to nongovernmental agencies in Congo. The United States has not contributed to the fund, which was set up late in 1997, more than six months after Mr. Kabila rose to power.</p>
        <p>More broadly, Mr. Kabila repeated his complaints that United States support for the Rwandan president, Mr. Kagame, has prolonged Rwanda's war in Congo, which began in 1998, ostensibly to pursue ethnic Hutu militias that had carried out genocidal attacks in Rwanda in 1994.  Rwanda says that Congo is not doing enough to deal with this threat.</p>
        <p>''If the State Department during the two years was not supporting Kagame and Museveni, I think we would be talking peace now -- and reconstruction,'' Mr. Kabila said. ''From the beginning we wanted to have good relations with the United States. We thought the United States will support us after the liberation, to democratize the country, to reconstruct the country. We didn't understand that a few people there had decided to support the aggressors, and abandon the Congolese people. They give all the money to Uganda and to Rwanda.''</p>
