        <p>For two months, Kerry McCoy's small, bowlegged body lay in a Port Jefferson, N.Y., hospital room, trapped in plaster from the waist down.</p>
        <p>As McCoy was crossing the street to meet his cousin, who was walking off a school bus, an unidentified driver had blown through the flashing stop lights. The hit-and-run accident had left him with two broken legs, but it did not shatter his sense of humor or his determination.</p>
        <p>He was 5, going on 15. ''He handled it like a young adult,'' his mother, Gretchen Cisco, said. ''He never complained, never said, 'Why me?' ''</p>
        <p>Instead, McCoy kept himself busy by watching television, making the nurses laugh and sneaking friends through the window. ''The minute he got the cast off,'' Cisco said, ''he was right back outside playing again.''</p>
        <p>He plays inside now. At 25, McCoy is two matches away from winning a spot on the United States Olympic freestyle wrestling team, a fierce resolve and endearing personality still his trademarks.</p>
        <p>The trials for both freestyle and Greco-Roman begin today, but because he is the current national heavyweight champion he has received a bye until Saturday's final round.</p>
        <p>When asked, McCoy will speak modestly about his resume: the 2000 national champion this year; the two-time collegiate champion at Penn State, where he was the chairman of the student advisory committee for the National Collegiate Athletic Association, and the state champion at Longwood High School in Middle Island, N.Y., where he was also a first chair cellist and the senior class president.</p>
        <p>But McCoy is blunt about his intentions. ''It's been instilled in me, if you're going to do something, do it 100 percent,'' he said, his eyes peering intently from behind his metal-rimmed glasses. ''Why do something if you're not going to be the best?''</p>
        <p>After he lost to his archrival, Stephen Neal, in the United States World Team Trials last summer, McCoy moved from State College, Pa., where he was an assistant wrestling coach at Penn State, to the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. He analyzed opponents' tendencies, tuned his own techniques and built muscle for six months. In April, he won his 12th straight match by edging Neal (who had won the world title in 1999) at the national championships, earning the first seeding.</p>
        <p>The trials will crown eight Olympians in each discipline. McCoy will likely battle Neal in the two-of-three-match final.</p>
        <p>''I think right now, he is a more-rounded wrestler than Stephen Neal,'' said the Olympic freestyle coach Bruce Burnett.</p>
        <p>If McCoy makes the team, it might signal the end of his wrestling career. McCoy plans to enter business school after the Sydney Games, to pursue a career in marketing, perhaps seeking a job at MTV.</p>
        <p>''He knows no boundaries,'' his mother said. ''He knows how to carry himself. And he doesn't think there's anything that's not possible.''</p>
        <p>McCoy inherited that trait from her. She was 17 when she was pregnant with him. She and McCoy's father, Richard, never married. They remain cordial today.</p>
        <p>McCoy, who spent weekends in the summer with his father, grew up embraced by younger siblings in two families. Cisco reared two children while working and studying, before she met her husband, Charles Cisco.</p>
        <p>''If I did have a role model, it was my mom,'' McCoy said. ''She didn't put up a front, saying she was perfect and didn't make any mistakes. She's human and you deal with that.''</p>
        <p>McCoy grew from a sensitive child in glasses, teased by the bully on the bus, into a precocious basketball player dominating neighborhood games. He started wrestling in seventh grade because there was no basketball program in middle school.</p>
        <p>''The first day of practice was one of hardest things I had ever been to,'' he said. ''I was with guys who were 13 and 14, and I was just getting beat up. I loved it.''</p>
        <p>He has made a career of seizing challenges. His first loss his junior year in high school was for the state championship. He did not lose again in high school, leaving Longwood with a state title at 177 pounds.</p>
        <p>In 1993, his freshman year at Penn State, McCoy did not even place at the nationals. The next year, he won the N.C.A.A. title and launched an 88-match winning streak that ended with a defeat at the 1995 championship. After redshirting in 1996 to train for the 1996 Olympics, McCoy won the N.C.A.A. title in 1997, beating a wrestler from Cal-State Bakersfield -- Neal.</p>
        <p>The rivalry with Neal, a series that McCoy leads by 5-4, is enough to motivate him without bittersweet memories of 1996. McCoy finished third at the Olympic trials four years ago, losing to the eventual Olympic gold medalist, Kurt Angle, in the 220-pound weight class.</p>
        <p>For the 2000 Olympics, though, he made a large adjustment; his weight class was eliminated, forcing McCoy to move up to heavyweight. As of 1998, he still weighed 220 pounds, losing to wrestlers as heavy as 286 pounds. He started working with the body builder, Joe Bastardi, in State College and now weighs 250, and is 6 feet 2 inches tall.</p>
        <p>McCoy's dedication is not the only thing to impress the Olympic team's coach. ''No question the first thing that grabbed me was his personality,'' Burnett said. ''What a joy to be around. I think he has a lot of options in life. As a matter of fact, I'm going to stick close to him, because he's going to make a lot of money.''</p>
        <p>Hopefully gold, first.</p>
        <p>Gutches Out of Trials</p>
        <p>Les Gutches, the reigning national champion at 187.25 pounds and 1996 Olympian, injured his back while training and will not wrestle at the trials. But because he is the national champion, Gutches received an extension; he will wrestle, at a date to be determined later, the winner of Saturday's finals for a spot on the Olympic team.</p>
