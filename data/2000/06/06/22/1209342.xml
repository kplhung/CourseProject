        <p>James E. Goodwin, the chief executive of the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, describes his proposed $4.3 billion purchase of US Airways as a ''win-win for consumers'' that will usher in a glorious new era of global air service.</p>
        <p>But many passengers see the proposed merger rather differently. For them, air travel is already a grim reality of high fares, interminable check-in lines, overcrowded planes, endless delays and in-flight meals that are stingy when they are offered at all. ''I look at fares now, especially for business trips, and they are outrageous,'' said Linda Kurz, an executive assistant in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Those two visions are on a collision course in Washington, where Mr. Goodwin and Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman of US Airways, have already faced a hostile Congress at several hearings. At issue is whether the airline industry, a generation after the 1978 deregulation law prompted a wave of industry consolidation, will best serve consumers if it is allowed to become even more concentrated.</p>
        <p>The United-US Airways deal, if approved by regulators, would create a winged giant that would carry one quarter of the nation's air traffic. The proposal has set off a frenzy of merger talks that many are convinced could reduce the country's six largest carriers to three mega-airlines. That prospect alarms consumer advocates and lawmakers who already complain that there is too little competition.</p>
        <p>''There will be no loss of competition if this merger goes through,'' Representative Leonard L. Boswell, Democrat of Iowa, said with more than a touch of irony,  ''because there is no competition now.''</p>
        <p>Representative Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois, was even more disturbed. ''I think the flying public is in for some real, real horror stories, worse than they have ever experienced,'' he said, adding that Congress does not have the power to stop the merger.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department will decide whether the combination hinders competition. But opponents and backers of the deal agree that it may rise and fall on public opinion and election-year politics.</p>
        <p>Several lawmakers have written to the Justice Department urging it to look carefully at the effect of the merger on the structure of the entire industry. A group of senators led by Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, asked the Transportation Department's inspector general to investigate the degree to which airline mergers adversely affect customer service. And attorneys general from 20 states have joined forces to oppose the deal.</p>
        <p>For its part, UAL, already the nation's largest airline, has enlisted a small army of lobbyists to make its case. Mr. Goodwin is now devoting nearly all his time to talking to anyone in Washington who will listen.</p>
        <p>By any measure, this is a terrible moment to propose an airline merger. The major carriers have faced a growing chorus of critics and government challenges in the last six years.</p>
        <p>As business fares rose to record highs in the mid-1990's, many cities and states came to resent the way large airlines dominated major metropolitan airports.</p>
        <p>Studies show that fares are much higher at such hubs than at airports with more carriers. In Minneapolis, for example, where Northwest Airlines is the biggest airline by far, fares on average were 49 percent higher than at comparable airports with greater competition.</p>
        <p>The major airlines were also accused of preying on new low-fare competitors. The Justice Department sued American Airlines in May 1999, accusing it of illegally driving a small competitor out of its Dallas-Fort Worth hub and then raising prices. American denies any wrongdoing and is fighting the government in court.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department filed suit in 1998 to force Northwest to sell its controlling stake in Continental Airlines. It charged that the deal would lead to higher ticket prices and diminished service for millions of passengers. That case is scheduled to go to trial later this year.</p>
        <p>Complaints about airlines rose to such a level last year that Congress came close to passing legislation mandating specific levels of service. The industry headed that off by submitting a voluntary set of standards, promising, among other things, to respond to complaints within 60 days and to allow consumers to hold reservations for 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, complaints are at a high, rising over 130 percent in the 12 months that ended in April.</p>
        <p>Both United and US Airways score at or near the bottom in industry measures of service compiled by the Transportation Department. United was ranked seventh and US Airways eighth in on-time arrivals for the 12 months that ended in April, according to the latest statistics.</p>
        <p>''How they could come forward with this deal in an environment like this leaves you scratching your head,'' said Kevin P. Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, which represents corporate airline customers.</p>
        <p>One explanation is that airline executives live in a world of statistics while passengers tend to remember individual flights. United flew 89 million passengers last year, so it is not surprising to Mr. Goodwin that some had problems. He acknowledged in an interview that United needs to improve its service, but he said that according to data compiled by the industry for internal use, United ranks at the top.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodwin and other airline executives point out that the number of passengers nearly tripled to 635 million last year compared with 240 million in 1977, before the industry was deregulated, but average fares, adjusted for inflation, declined 40 percent in the same period. Still, the complex way the industry sets fares, which seem to change by the minute, has fueled broad resentment among consumers.</p>
        <p>''The problem with the airline industry,'' said Leo F. Mullin, the chief executive of Delta Air Lines, ''is that it gets killed by anecdotes.''</p>
        <p>Most airline executives and industry analysts on Wall Street believe that consolidation is inevitable. Industry profit margins, even in the best years, are about 5 percent compared with an average at least twice that for the companies included in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.</p>
        <p>United argues that combining with US Airways will give it a strong presence along the East Coast, where it is weak. That will be a boon for consumers, the airline said, because the new United would be able to offer service on 560 city-to-city routes, like Sacramento to Erie, Pa., and Fargo, N.D., to Panama City, Fla., that neither it nor US Airways currently serves. Together with its international partners, United said it would also be able to offer ''seamless'' service to numerous destinations in Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p>But critics say the deal will only force United's rivals to get bigger, too. Within days of United's announcement, the AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, the country's second-largest airline, entered into merger discussions with both Northwest and Delta.</p>
        <p>Many analysts believe that AMR will ultimately seek to merge with No. 4 Northwest, while No. 3 Delta will try to combine with No. 5 Continental Airlines. That would create three giants carrying 80 percent of all passengers.</p>
        <p>Some airline executives argue that having three truly national carriers competing head to head in every city would be an improvement on the situation today, in which the six airlines have hegemony over so-called fortress hubs at major metropolitan airports.</p>
        <p>But Samuel Buttrick, an airline analyst with PaineWebber in New York, called the notion that three big carriers would offer more competition than six independent airlines ''borderline lunacy.''</p>
        <p>He said that ''more competitors means more supply, means more choice at better prices.''</p>
        <p>Many consumers agree. ''Right now all the airlines have to compete for the same dollar,'' said Wally Thompson, a salesman in Manhattan. ''Once they don't have to compete, prices will go up.''</p>
        <p>To mute criticism, United has pledged not to lay off any of the 40,000 US Airways employees and has also vowed not to increase fares for two years after the deal is consummated. In addition, because a combined United-US Airways would dominate air travel in the Washington area, US Airways has agreed to sell most of its operations at Ronald Reagan National Airport to Robert L. Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television and a US Airways director.</p>
        <p>But many executives and analysts believe the fare freeze is meaningless because United has said it reserves the right to raise prices in response to inflation and fuel costs. Executives at rival airlines also said that United would ultimately be forced to abandon some of the US Airways hub airports to justify the expense of the deal.</p>
        <p>DC Air, Mr. Johnson's new airline, has also been heavily criticized as a ploy to keep valuable assets at National Airport out of the hands of United's strongest competitors.  There are also concerns that DC Air, which will depend on United for all its services from ticketing to maintenance, will not be a truly independent competitor. And even if it is, United would still be the clearly dominant airline in Washington.</p>
        <p>And bigger is not necessarily better for frequent fliers, including some in Congress.</p>
        <p>''I'm a two-million-mile customer of United,'' Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon, told Mr. Goodwin. ''I want a reasonable price, and I want better service. I am not so concerned about the seamlessness of my international and national travel. That's what travel agents are for.''</p>
