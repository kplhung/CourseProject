        <p>The City Council heard testimony yesterday about a minority said to endure such constant, lifelong inequality that one lawmaker wants the group included as a protected class in anti-discrimination statutes. These sufferers, among them Oprah Winfrey, the last three American presidents and Allison Steinberg of Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Queens, are left-handers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Steinberg, 17, was one of those testifying before the Council's General Welfare Committee on Resolution 718, introduced by a right-hander, Councilman Morton Povman, in all seriousness. The resolution, inspired by a student research project in Mr. Povman's Queens district, calls upon the Council to study the issue of left-handedness. But ultimately, Mr. Povman thinks that left-handers should be protected by law under the City Charter.</p>
        <p>''Left-handedness in history was always treated as something abnormal and strange,'' Mr. Povman said in his opening remarks. (One example: the Latin for left is ''sinister.'') Mr. Povman said that when he introduced his resolution last year, he heard from people all over the world. ''As far as London, as far as Berlin, I got calls even from Russia,'' he said, ''telling me to go ahead with this.''</p>
        <p>And then, before any of the two dozen listeners in the big Council chamber had time to think that this was political evenhandedness run amok, or maybe that the City Council did not have enough to do, Ms. Steinberg came forward, lifted her left hand to be sworn in, then testified on behalf of the 10 percent of New York City residents, about 700,000 people, who are lefties.</p>
        <p>''If discrimination can be defined as making it difficult for a group of individuals to function in society,'' she began, ''then left-handed people are discriminated against.''</p>
        <p>She made these statements to back her claim: Doors open in favor of the right-handed. It is hard to find left-handed baseball gloves and hockey sticks. Bannisters and guard rails in public buildings are usually on the right side of a stairwell. ''A person who loses his or her balance will instinctively reach out with the dominant hand,'' Ms. Steinberg said, adding that ''societal discrimination results in the death of the left-handed population an average of 14 years earlier than the right-handed population due to related accidents.''</p>
        <p>There's more, Ms. Steinberg said. Public access computers have mice shaped for the right hand. A rifle commonly used in the military is designed only for the right-handed. ''When this weapon is fired, cartridges eject to the right, toward the person's face,'' Ms. Steinberg said.</p>
        <p>And, not least, Ms. Steinberg said, most desks in New York City public schools are for the right-handed. ''When I sit in this desk,'' she said, ''my left arm hangs in midair. This makes it impossible to write. To correct this problem, I must contort my body. I can no longer see the teacher or the front of the classroom.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Steinberg was followed by two other Cardozo students, Cindy Chau and Karen Friedner, both right-handers. Ms. Chau, 18, asked the City Council to go further than its borders and propose an amendment to the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964. Ms. Friedner, 18, said discrimination against left-handers began early. ''You try to cut a straight line with right-handed safety scissors,'' she said, ''and your line becomes one big mess.''</p>
        <p>The genesis of the morning was a quality-of-life competition sponsored by Salomon Smith Barney that the students entered last year. Their task was to identify a community problem and propose a ''financially feasible'' solution. Once they settled on left-handedness as a project, they wrote a paper. (Their adviser, Jan Shakofsky, described the process as ''writing, writing, writing and rewriting.'')</p>
        <p>After that, the students took their work to another Cardozo teacher, Jeffrey Gottlieb, who also happens to be Mr. Povman's chief of staff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gottlieb, who finishes his work at Cardozo around 2 p.m. and then works at Mr. Povman's office until 8 p.m., was the author of the Council's left-handed resolution.</p>
        <p>The students made it to the semifinals of the competition and then had their hearing at City Hall, where Stephen DiBrienza, the chairman of the General Welfare Committee, pronounced himself impressed. Although he said he doubted that left-handedness ''would require government action,'' he did say that his staff would press the Board of Education about the need for left-handed desks and supplies.</p>
        <p>Ms. Steinberg, who will be a student at Hunter College this fall, pronounced herself equally impressed with both the Council members and the hearing. ''I expected it to be intimidating,'' she said, ''but it wasn't as intimidating as I thought. They were palatable.''</p>
