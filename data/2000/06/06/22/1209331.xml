        <p>Italian advertising is known for shock value. But even in Italy, the image of former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, 81, glaring sinisterly in black and white from huge city billboards and full-page newspaper ads, was startling.</p>
        <p>The ad copy for a new Diner's Club Web site, www.DiNetClub.com, plays with Mr. Andreotti's long, tumultuous history in postwar politics: ''He thought he had seen everything. So he thought.''</p>
        <p>The creator of the ad, Marco Testa, head of the Armando Testa Agency, explained that Mr. Andreotti's fame and his reputation for dry humor made him an obvious choice.  ''There is a string of irony running through his personality that makes the ad work.''</p>
        <p>But there is another unexpected twist buried in the advertising campaign.</p>
        <p>The Internet got a late start in Italy but is already viewed by sociologists as a catalyst for social change, a way of breaking down Italy's rigid old boy network of political and financial influence and of creating jobs, uninherited fortunes and new power bases. Mr. Andreotti, seven times prime minister and who last year was acquitted in two trials of charges he colluded with the Mafia, symbolizes something else: the revenge of Italy's gerontocracy.</p>
        <p>In the 1990's, after an investigation of widespread political corruption toppled the old political order, causing the Socialist Party and Mr. Andreotti's centrist Christian Democratic Party to collapse, many Italians believed that a new generation of business and political leaders would arise. Many new faces did emerge, but lately, older ones are back in business.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, for example, had cabinet posts in many previous governments, including those of the disgraced, and now deceased, Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi in the 1980's. Earlier this month, Mr. Amato threatened to quit if his embattled center-left coalition sought a fresh, new face (i.e., not his own), as the standard-bearer in next year's elections.</p>
        <p>''Whether in politics, finance, business, or academia, in Italy there is a widespread gerontocracy, like the Kremlin 20 years ago,'' Giampaolo Fabris, a sociology professor, said. Mr. Fabris is studying aging at IULM, the Free University of Language and Communication in Milan. At 62, Mr. Fabris is, by Italian academic standards, a young Turk.</p>
        <p>''There are more and more exceptions, of course, but there is still tremendous resistance to change,'' Mr. Fabris explained. ''In some things, Italy is rightly known for creativity and innovation, but it is at its core an archaic civilization. In those, elders retain power and control.''</p>
        <p>Nepotism is one factor. The state statistics agency last month published a study showing that 38 percent of Italians under 40 got their jobs through friends or family connections. A 1999 study by Bocconi University's School of Management in Milan found that 78 percent of Italy's top 150 companies were family owned. (The figure in the United States is 20 percent.) The implicit quid pro quo is that the father stays on as long as he likes.</p>
        <p>''My father worked until he died, at the age of 74,'' Mr. Testa, 49, who took over the advertising firm at his death in 1992, explained.</p>
        <p>Demographics also play a role. Italy has one of the lowest birthrates in the world, and 18 percent of its population is over 65. Average life expectancy in Italy, which keeps growing, reached 75.5 in 1998 for men, according to the statistics agency. Women's average life expectancy is 81.8.</p>
        <p>While most Italians retire at relatively young ages, overburdening the pension system, within Italy's elite, leaders die with their Gucci shoes on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Andreotti, who said he would donate his advertising fee to charity, certainly shows no sign of retiring. He is active in the Senate and writes articles, attends conferences and makes many talk show appearances.</p>
        <p>Gianni Agnelli, also a senator for life, is now the honorary chairman of Fiat. Removed from day-to-day company decision-making, he remains, at 81, Italy's prince of industry, who regally welcomed Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, to Milan.</p>
        <p>Enrico Cuccia, who turns 93 in November, just got out of the hospital, but still keeps an office and the title of honorary chairman of Mediobanca, one of Italy's most important banks. Other executives run Mediobanca day-to-day, but Mr. Cuccia is clinging to his perch. His most recent entry in Who's Who in Italy explains that he ''has played a key role in all of the major financial operations carried out in Italy.''</p>
        <p>Neither age nor scandal serve as automatic springboards to retirement. In 1997, Cesare Romiti, then 73 and chairman of Fiat, was convicted of accounting fraud and illegal political contributions and given an 18-month suspended sentence. (It was reduced further on appeal in 1999.) The case was one of the most prominent in the Tangentopoli, or ''Bribesville,'' scandals of the 1990's, but Mr. Romiti did not fade away. In 1998, he nimbly became chairman of RCS-Corriere della Sera, a huge publishing empire of which Fiat owns the largest equity stake.</p>
        <p>Things are changing -- shaken up by Silicon Valley. Italy, too, now has a new generation of relatively young computer plutocrats, most notably, Renato Soru, 42, a Sardinian real-estate developer and founder of Tiscali, an Internet start-up that for a short while this year surpassed Fiat in market value. He is on a 1999 list of Italy's 10 wealthiest men, but his is one of the few new names on a roster dominated by long-established family fortunes.</p>
        <p>When Antonio D'Amato was elected head of Confindustria, Italy's powerful association of industrialists last year, the fact that he was 43 and from Naples, not the north, was hailed as revolutionary. Italian business magazines regularly highlight the best and the brightest young executives, often featuring Luca Garavoglia, 31, president of Campari, the beverage company. He is also, however, the son of the former chairman, Domenico Garavoglia, and took over two years after his father's death in 1992. Some in Italy say Mr. Garavoglia is nevertheless a symbol of progress.</p>
        <p>''It's one thing to be the son without power,'' Guido Corbetta, 40, a professor at Bocconi University, said. ''But it is another to be given full power in your 30's, 40's or 50's.''</p>
        <p>Italian politics has grown slightly more youthful. Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the president, is 79, but Prime Minister Amato is 62, and his chief rival,  the center-right opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi, a media tycoon, is 63. Some of the most respected newspaper columnists are old enough to have covered the monarchy.</p>
        <p>Ninety-year-old Indro Montanelli writes a daily column in Corriere della Sera. Enzo Biagi, 80, writes columns for several publications and also hosts a nightly five-minute news commentary on RAI One, Italy's leading public network.</p>
        <p>Academia has seen the least mobility. At La Sapienza, the state university of Rome and the largest university in Italy, the median age for senior professors is 63. (It is 58 for ordinary professors; 49 for researchers.) In an effort to unclog Italy's tenure track, the government recently lowered the mandatory retirement age for academia from 72 to 67.</p>
        <p>Younger Italian doctors also complain about what they term the ''barons'' of medicine. Part of the problem is the sheer number of doctors -- Italy has twice as many per capita as Finland. But top jobs in hospitals and medical schools are still tightly controlled by an older generation. Paolo Marotta, 39, who co-founded a union of younger doctors to lobby against the medical establishment, said it took him 12 years to find a job in the Italian public health system -- even though he is in a boom industry -- gerontology. ''And I am one of the really lucky ones,'' Dr. Marotta said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Andreotti's new ad campaign adapts one of his best-known quips to the Web site: ''The Internet wears out those who don't have it.'' But Mr.  Andreotti's original words were perhaps more fitting: ''Power wears out those who don't have it.''</p>
