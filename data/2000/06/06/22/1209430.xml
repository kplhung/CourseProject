        <p>A New York City police officer was found guilty yesterday of lying to federal agents about what he saw in a Brooklyn station house in the minutes after Abner Louima was brutally tortured there three years ago.</p>
        <p>The conviction of the officer, Francisco Rosario, brought to a close the protracted criminal prosecution of the Louima case, which has resulted in guilty pleas or verdicts involving  five other city police officers in the last two years.</p>
        <p>The federal government joined the investigation of the savage attack on Mr. Louima within days after he was beaten and sodomized with a broken broomstick inside the 70th Precinct station house on Aug. 9, 1997. The case against Officer Rosario arose from that investigation; the government claimed that he conspired with his partner, Rolando Aleman, to mislead F.B.I. agents and then lied to the agents in two interviews in the aftermath of the attack.</p>
        <p>A jury in Federal District Court in Brooklyn found Officer Rosario guilty of the conspiracy charge and of lying to investigators on Sept. 22, 1997, by saying that he was not inside the precinct's arrest room when Mr. Louima was placed in a cell there immediately after his ordeal, still reeking of feces and with his pants at his ankles. But the jury acquitted Officer Rosario of charges that he lied a second time, on Nov. 20, 1997, by saying that Thomas Bruder, not Justin A. Volpe, was the patrolman who escorted Mr. Louima into the cell.</p>
        <p>Mr. Volpe is serving a 30-year prison term after confessing to the attack at a trial in May 1999. Another officer, Charles Schwarz, was convicted at the same trial of helping torture Mr. Louima and was found guilty at a second trial in March of plotting with Officer Bruder and another officer, Thomas Wiese, to hide his role in the attack.</p>
        <p>Officers Bruder and Wiese were also convicted in the cover-up plot, but were acquitted at an earlier trial of attacking Mr. Louima. Officer Aleman pleaded guilty in April to virtually the same charges that Officer Rosario faced at his trial.</p>
        <p>Officer Rosario was never accused of taking part in the assault on Mr. Louima or even in what federal prosecutors called the insidious effort to cover it up.</p>
        <p>It was largely coincidence that the officer became embroiled in the case. He was not assigned to the 70th Precinct, but was a member of the roving Street Crime Unit, who happened to be in the station house the night of the attack, doing paperwork on a suspect he had just arrested.</p>
        <p>Still, the Rosario trial, which began two weeks ago, provided a powerful coda on the theme of police officers' reluctance to speak out against their own. The most damning message to arise from the trial came from the defendant's own testimony as he told the jury that in essence he had lied to the F.B.I. because he was frightened that appearing in court to testify against another officer would jeopardize his family and his career.</p>
        <p>Speaking outside the courthouse after the verdict, Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, said that while the charges in the Rosario trial were relatively minor, the conviction was important for the message that it sent to the city's police force.</p>
        <p>''Every officer has a sworn obligation to assist investigations and assist them truthfully,'' she said. ''This is what happens when they take the other path.''</p>
        <p>Officer Rosario's lawyers said the acquittal on one of the charges showed that the jury believed their client was now telling the truth. Officer Rosario freely admitted on the witness stand that he had lied about his whereabouts on the night of the assault and maintained throughout the trial that he had seen Officer Bruder, not Mr. Volpe, leading Mr. Louima into the cell.</p>
        <p>''The jury has vindicated Frank Rosario,'' said one of the lawyers, Raymond Granger. ''Our position has been from the start that he eventually came forward and told the truth.'' Mr. Granger added that he would appeal the two counts on which Officer Rosario had been found guilty.</p>
        <p>The jurors, whose identities were not made public, did not comment about the trial.</p>
        <p>Officer Rosario, 35, remained impassive as the verdicts were read, tapping his feet. He looked at the jury squarely and kept his chin held high.</p>
        <p>Officer Rosario faces up to five years in prison on each of the two counts on which he was convicted.</p>
        <p>A sentencing date has not been set.</p>
