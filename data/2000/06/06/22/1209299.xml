        <p>Making its first foray into consumer electronics -- but still tethered to the personal computer -- the Dell Computer Corporation said yesterday that it was preparing to introduce a PC-based digital audio receiver that would allow MP3 and WMA music files stored on a personal computer to be played through a home stereo system or in any room of the house.</p>
        <p>The new Dell receiver, which is expected to go on sale at www.gigabuys.com in August for $249 (or $199 when bought with a Dell Dimension computer), is a small, radio-style box that uses an HPNA (Home Phoneline Networking Alliance) version 2.0 or Ethernet network to tap into the digital music files stored on a personal computer. An HPNA 2.0 network card for the PC costs between $50 and $70, depending on the manufacturer. It allows the digital audio receiver to pull MP3 songs and playlists, managed by either Music Match or Real Audio software, into the receiver through a home's existing phone jacks. The receiver itself can be plugged into the home stereo's RCA jack to fill the house with music, or it can be set up with an optional $99 set of Acoustic Research speakers to bring the PC music to any room where music is wanted.</p>

        <p>Dell's new audio appliance shares the same basic design as S3 Inc.'s Rio Digital Audio Receiver, which was demonstrated last month, but unlike the Rio, the Dell has a retro-style radio control panel. The Rio music appliance will be sold in consumer electronics and computer retail stores later this summer for $299.95, which includes the receiver, an H.P.N.A. 2.0 network card, two phone cords and an RCA cable.</p>
