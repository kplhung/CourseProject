        <p>A NEW museum rises from Seattle's streets like great, billowing clouds of rippling aluminum and stainless steel, its shapes so devoid of straight lines that it appears to have been grown rather than to have been built by human hands.</p>
        <p>Even the curvy steel superstructure of the museum, the Experience Music Project, was designed with computer assistance and fabricated to such exacting specifications that its manufacture had to be guided by computers as well, its builders say.</p>
        <p>Frank O. Gehry, when designing the museum, used the same computer tools that were originally developed to design Mirage fighter jets. In the end, he has said, he likes to think of his latest creation, its multicolored skin glittering in the famously infrequent sunshine of the Northwest, as a ''three-dimensional floating puzzle.''</p>
        <p>But perhaps more than any other museum, the Experience Music Project, or E.M.P., owes its existence and operation to contemporary computer technology. When the 140,000-square-foot interactive museum officially opens tomorrow, visitors will encounter an almost seamless array of digital technology engineered, its designers say, to guide, track, entertain and enlighten visitors as they explore and celebrate American popular music, mostly rock 'n' roll.</p>
        <p>''It's the perfect building for rebelliousness and innovation,'' said Paul Zumwalt, who managed E.M.P.'s design and construction. ''It's not meant to be conservative, and it's not meant for everyone to like it. Not everyone likes the same music.''</p>
        <p>Speaking of the museum's use of technology, Mr. Zumwalt added, ''It's going to change the way people move through museums.''</p>
        <p>The cavernous music museum is full of artifacts deemed by its curators to be important to the rock era. On display are about 1,500 pieces -- from a collection of 100,000 -- including Gibson's original, 65-year-old experimental electric guitar, the handwritten lyric notebook that once belonged to Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, Janis Joplin's velvet blouse and the white Fender Stratocaster guitar that Jimi Hendrix, a Seattle native, played at Woodstock in 1969.</p>
        <p>There are collections that highlight the work of musicians who came from the Northwest, like the Kingsmen, the Fleetwoods, Bing Crosby, Quincy Jones and Ray Charles. There are exhibitions that explore rock 'n' roll's roots by displaying genre touchstones like Bo Diddley's 1956 guitar, young Elvis Presley's leather jacket and a 1942 Wurlitzer jukebox.</p>
        <p>And there are more contemporary items from the hip-hop world like turntables belonging to Grandmaster Flash, a drum machine used by Dr. Dre to record his breakthrough album, ''The Chronic,'' and original works by two New York graffiti artists, Dondi and Midg.</p>
        <p>''There are tons and tons of stuff in this building,'' said Dave Leinweber, information systems manager for E.M.P. ''The trouble we're going to have is getting people to leave.''</p>
        <p>Almost everything in E.M.P. has been tweaked or enhanced by computer technology. A book of lyrics handwritten by Mr. Hendrix can be found under glass in a traditional exhibit case, for example, but in a special kiosk, not unlike an automated teller machine, the entire notebook has been digitized and made accessible by means of a touch-sensitive liquid crystal display screen. Slide a finger along a section of the notebook and Mr. Hendrix's tortured scribble is instantly rendered in easy-to-read text. The same touch screen can toggle between demo versions and completed versions of Hendrix songs or it can activate multimedia tours and tutorials on some of the musical forms that influenced him.</p>
        <p>''One of our goals in the E.M.P. is to get people to be better listeners, to be more perceptive listeners,'' said Jon Kertzer, the museum's director of multimedia and special projects.</p>
        <p>More extraordinary gadgetry can also be found, ranging from flat, 42-inch gas plasma display screens playing music videos and artists' oral histories to interactive lessons guided by computers on automated drum kits, electric guitars and keyboards.</p>
        <p>Nearly every vintage electric guitar in the museum's guitar gallery can be heard in the form of a digital recording of its being played by a master musician. Visitors can also perform in a kind of virtual karaoke machine that simulates what it sounds and feels like to play as a rock musician before an arena crowd.</p>
        <p>In a motion ride through musical innovation and creativity, called the Artist's Journey, 40 visitors at a time bump and glide in seats that move by way of a hydraulically controlled platform in front of a large, wraparound screen that features a digitized image of James Brown. Beneath visitors' seats are air hoses designed to fill the theater with appropriate smells to enhance the story.</p>
        <p>Almost every corner of E.M.P., which is the brainchild of the billionaire Paul G. Allen, Microsoft's co-founder (and a Seattle resident), and his sister, Jody Allen Patton, the museum's co-founder and executive director, is crammed with cutting-edge computer technology. Even for cellular telephones to work inside E.M.P., which is basically a giant steel cage, special repeaters had to be installed so that cell phone signals would not just haplessly bounce off the museum's walls.</p>
        <p>The videos and music that play continuously in the museum do not use conventional videocassettes, CD's or DVD's as a source (although they can). Instead, everything is delivered by a custom-made, high-speed local area network that pumps songs and high-resolution images throughout the museum over miles of cables running to banks of computer servers.</p>
        <p>The system is so flexible and so easy to customize, said Robert Fitzsimmons, the director of technology for E.M.P., that the museum's electronic sights and sounds can be reprogrammed with unprecedented ease and speed.</p>
        <p>''You could change the experience based on time of day, by visitor group, by all kinds of things,'' said Mr. Fitzsimmons, who is senior project manager of technology at Vulcan Northwest, which designed some of E.M.P.'s systems. ''You wouldn't have to run out and change DVD's and all of that.''</p>
        <p>But Kathy Scanlan, deputy director of museum services, cautions that E.M.P. is not about technology for technology's sake.</p>
        <p>''The point is that it's not a technology museum,'' Ms. Scanlan said. ''The point is to enhance the experience with technology. What you're really doing is experiencing music here and tapping into your creativity.</p>
        <p>''If that leads you to be creative with a computer, that's great.''</p>
