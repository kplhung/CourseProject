        <p>In 1997, original stamping dies like the one above were found in a deserted warehouse in Estonia. The dies were for five patterns of luxurious sterling silver flatware designed by Peter Carl Faberge in St. Petersburg, Russia, at the end of the 19th century. Now, the flatware, originally designed for Alexandra, wife of Czar Nicholas II, for use in imperial Russian palaces, is being produced in Sweden in limited quantities. Because they are made from the original molds, the pieces are considered originals and not reproductions.</p>
        <p>From $729 to $838 for a five-piece place setting; available at Bergdorf Goodman, Fifth Avenue and 58 Street.</p>
