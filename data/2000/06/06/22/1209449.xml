        <p>Members of Earl Faison's family were both happy and bitter today after a federal indictment charged five Orange police officers with violating Mr. Faison's civil rights, alleging that he was kicked, beaten and robbed in custody before he died on April 11, 1999.</p>
        <p>His father, Earl Williams, eager for the truth about his son's death for 14 months, described the indictment as a ''little ray of sunshine.'' Mr. Faison's mother, Carolyn Faison, called it a ''piece of good news.''</p>
        <p>His stepmother, Sagirah Williams, said the family had been patient. She thanked the F.B.I., the United States attorney's office and the grand jury for the investigation. ''They did a wonderful job,'' Ms. Williams said.</p>
        <p>The longer the family discussed the charges -- the first filed so far in the case -- the angrier they became about the death of Mr. Faison, who was 27.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams said at the family's news conference here this afternoon that he would like to see the officers eventually sentenced for murder. He paused, as if he were about to correct himself. Then, half apologetically and half angrily, he added: ''I'm going to keep using that word. He should have come home that night.''</p>
        <p>A moment later, Mrs. Williams said her stepson was killed in police custody. ''It was just outright murder,'' she said. ''I'm just so glad the truth came out. This was like gangsterlike tactics to me. They took away a life. They took away somebody's father. He has four children.''</p>
        <p>The couple's anger seemed directed not so much at the charges of civil rights violations but at what Mr. Williams characterized as a string of lies by the Orange Police Department and the Essex County prosecutor's office in the days after Mr. Faison died.</p>
        <p>The lies, Mr. Williams said in an interview this morning after the indictment was announced, had defamed his son, and he has spent the last 14 months trying to restore his son's reputation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams said that, a day or so after his son died, he saw autopsy photographs of his son's battered body, and has said ever since that the photos convinced him that his son had been beaten. After he saw the photos, he said today, the prosecutor at the time, Patricia A. Hurt, issued a statement saying the autopsy had found no evidence of kicking, beating or strangulation.</p>
        <p>The indictment said the officers kicked and punched Mr. Faison and sprayed pepper spray in his mouth and nose while his wrists were handcuffed. Mr. Williams recalled today  he had been told his son had no money with him when he died. The indictment charged one officer with robbing him at gunpoint.</p>
        <p>From the first, Mr. Williams has also questioned the police report that Mr. Faison was carrying a semiautomatic handgun and tried to throw it away as officers chased him. ''If they can lie about him not having money, then they can lie about him having a gun,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The indictment said nothing about Mr. Faison's having a gun.</p>
        <p>Mr. Faison was arrested in a frenzied police search in Orange and East Orange after an Orange police officer, Joyce Carnegie, was killed on April 8, 1999. The gunman was described by witnesses as a bald black man with a goatee, but, Mr. Williams said, his son did not have a goatee or a bald head. The police arrested three innocent men, including Mr. Faison, before they found the killer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Faison, whose children are from 2 to 6 years old, was a musician and producer. His rap group, Tombstone Entertainment, played for  clubs and churches in East Orange and Newark.</p>
        <p>Hours before he was arrested, he had returned from a rap concert in Virginia. He had been taking recording equipment by cab from his aunt's house to his fiancee's apartment, when officers stopped the cab carrying him from his fiancee's home, his family has said. The police have said he ran, threw down a handgun and resisted arrest, forcing officers to subdue him with spray.</p>
        <p>The federal indictment said nothing about Mr. Faison's committing such criminal acts. Instead, it said the officers handcuffed and kicked him on the street and then punched him in the back seat of a patrol car before robbing him and spraying him with pepper spray at police  headquarters.</p>
        <p>''They wanted to make him look like a real bad guy,'' Mr. Williams said of the Orange police. ''But I don't think they'll ever taint his image. He wasn't about anything negative. If he was such a bad guy, how can 3,000 people show up at his wake? He was the kind of guy who would try to stop a fight between strangers rather than let it go on.''</p>
