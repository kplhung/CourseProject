        <p>No one can fault the volunteer firefighters here for not trying. With their corps dwindling, the department in this Dutchess County town put billboards on Route 55, built a gymnasium to attract young members, tried a pension plan for old-timers and set up an 800 number for new recruits.</p>
        <p>None of it made a difference.</p>
        <p>So beginning a decade ago with one paid firefighter and picking up steam so that today there are 14, the La Grange department took the step that experts say was unavoidable, if unwelcome. It challenged a tradition that dates back to pre-Revolution days, put community safety ahead of nostalgia and joined a small but growing number of fire departments across the nation that supplement volunteers with professionals.</p>
        <p>''Nobody wants to see it change on their watch,'' said Shawn Murray, a volunteer who joined in 1976 and is now a paid deputy chief in La Grange, east of Poughkeepsie. ''But we saw the writing on the wall.''</p>
        <p>Nationwide since 1983, there has been a 5 to 10 percent reduction in volunteers, who represent 74 percent of America's firefighters, according to the National Volunteer Fire Center in Washington. In New York State, the decline has been 25 percent in the last 25 years.</p>
        <p>Everywhere, the reasons are the same. The stalwarts are dying off. Young families are juggling careers and children, racing from the train to Little League. And housing prices are forcing out blue-collar workers in exchange for professionals without the inclination, the skill or the time to fight fires.</p>
        <p>The logical solution is hiring a few professionals to ensure that the rigs get out the door, especially during the hard-to-staff weekday hours, when the fire signal once summoned farmers, shopkeepers and shift workers. But change comes hard to this tight fraternity, even in the face of demographic upheaval.</p>
        <p>Since Benjamin Franklin founded one of the earliest companies in Philadelphia in 1736, robust volunteer departments have been the gold standard of fire protection. And the firehouse has been a hub of community life. There was food, even in the Depression, and often the first television set in town. There were pancake breakfasts, carnivals and smoke-filled bars where grandfathers, fathers and sons shared tales of courage.</p>
        <p>La Grange hoped a gradual approach would blunt resentment from old-timers, the ones who buff the parade wagons to a sparkle for the Fourth of July. After hiring one paid employee 11 years ago, the department added another every few years and, with the transition going smoothly, 10 more since 1997.</p>
        <p>Only last January did La Grange allow a paid man into the command structure, naming Mr. Murray deputy chief. By all measures, the 14 professional firefighters and paramedics have improved service, reduced requests for help from neighboring departments and cost each taxpayer less than $20 a year.</p>
        <p>''They did it exactly right, steppingstone by steppingstone,'' said Henry Campbell, a former firefighter who is now a consultant to Westchester County's new Department of Emergency Services.</p>
        <p>Mr. Campbell said that few departments had the foresight of La Grange and thus would resist professional reinforcements until a catastrophe. But combination departments have existed in Westchester for decades and are popping up in other northern suburbs and outside Albany, Rochester and Buffalo.</p>
        <p>Statewide, there are 1,800 fire departments, 1,650 of them all volunteer and 150 all paid or a combination. New York State has 112,500 volunteers and 19,500 professionals, more than half in New York City.</p>
        <p>Attrition is measured in many ways. In Port Washington, on Long Island, Walter Trapp was on a waiting list for 13 months when he volunteered 28 years ago. A decade ago, half a dozen recruits joined the department each month. Now, nobody has volunteered in the last four months. Erie County, in upstate New York, spent $300,000 on recruitment efforts, but landed just six new men.</p>
        <p>John Cullen, 68, a longtime firefighter around Westchester, both paid and volunteer, can tick off the changes he has seen in the last 30 years. Two-career families. Long commutes. Extracurricular activities for children. Soaring real estate prices that force out the working class. Families scattered. ''That chain is broke,'' Mr. Cullen said. ''Everything's changed. We got rich; that's what we did. When we were poor, the firehouse was everything.''</p>
        <p>The firehouse was home away from home for men with dirt on their hands: carpenters, sanitation workers, foremen. Some live in the houses where they raised their children. But they are losing ground to college-educated professionals, urban transplants with no history in the community.</p>
        <p>''People who live in million-dollar houses aren't volunteer firemen,'' Mr. Cullen said, adding that it is a rare lawyer or stockbroker who rushes into a burning building. ''These are not the type of people to drop The Wall Street Journal and grab a fire hose.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cullen noted that the most vibrant volunteer departments in the region are in former factory towns along the Hudson. Descendants of those laborers remain, into the third and fourth generations -- plumbers, small merchants, municipal workers -- and gung-ho volunteers.</p>
        <p>One such village is Hastings-on-Hudson, where the volunteer Fire Department is the envy of Westchester County, with 120 active members. Few communities expect more than a dozen volunteers on a weekday, even for a major blaze. But Hastings's chief, Robert J. Schnibbe, counted 47 recently when burning food set off a home smoke alarm, and 39 when a pipe burst in the beauty parlor of an old age home.</p>
        <p>But Chief Schnibbe is not complacent. ''It just shows we don't have a problem here yet,'' he said. ''And I mean 'yet.' I'm not saying it's not going to happen.''</p>
        <p>Real estate values are starting to force the issue in Hastings, as they have elsewhere. ''We have 18-, 19-, 20-year-old kids who still live at home,'' said John McDwyer, a paid firefighter in Rye, where the average house now costs $600,000. ''But when they get married, they move because they can't afford to live here.''</p>
        <p>Then there is sprawl, turning farmland into distant suburbs. ''They're on a 6 a.m. train,'' said Chief Murray, talking about La Grange residents who commute two hours to Manhattan, a recent development since construction of half-million-dollar houses. ''They're not home till 8 at night. How can they come to the fire station?''</p>
        <p>Feminism, too, has taken a toll. The Ladies Auxiliary is a relic. And it is a rare woman willing to bathe the children and supervise homework while her husband drinks beer and shoots pool at the firehouse. (These days, a firefighter who has been drinking can't answering a call.)</p>
        <p>''Our generation, dads are more active with their children,'' said John Castelhano, a paid firefighter in Rye.</p>
        <p>It has not helped that the number of false alarms has skyrocketed and the number of fires plummeted, both a result of smoke detectors. A call to 911 results in a message on volunteers' pagers. ''Unless they hear the magic words 'working fire' or 'smoke showing,' they won't go,'' Mr. Castelhano said.</p>
        <p>Rye is one of 14 combination departments in Westchester County, along with four fully paid and 39 all-volunteer forces. Although paid firefighters were added decades ago, the tension remains thick between the two camps, one fighting to preserve a way of life and the other seeking more union jobs.</p>
        <p>The integration of paid firefighters in Rye was made with none of the care of La Grange. On paper, the 15 professionals are supposed to do nothing but drive the fire trucks and operate the pumps while the volunteers fight the fires. ''But sometimes we pull up and we're the only ones there,'' Hal Aken said.</p>
        <p>Rye has 240 volunteers, but rarely do more than two dozen show up. Some are too old to enter a burning building. Others are what Walter Roode, the 69-year-old chief, calls ''social members,'' who pull up each afternoon at 4:30 only to retire to the second-floor bar, and who limit their work to ''helping with picnics.''</p>
        <p>The paid firefighters would like the bar closed, as it has been in La Grange. They would like to be part of the command structure, as Shawn Murray is. ''We wouldn't even consider that,'' said Mr. Roode, a retired public works foreman who has been fighting fires since the end of the Korean War. ''Our system works, so why fix it?'' Mr. Roode first denied there was tension in the firehouse, then blamed it on union organizers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roode, typical of volunteer chiefs, drives a shiny Ford Explorer emblazoned with department insignia. It has a flashing roof light and is gassed up at the Department of Public Works. It is but one of the perks of the job, which also include a front-and-center position at holiday parades, in a $350,000 custom pumper with gold leaf to spare.</p>
        <p>''The gold leaf, the trophies, the bragging rights, all that built morale and helped drive membership,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''Part of being a volunteer firefighter was strutting your stuff. But you can't go back to yesteryear. As more and more people come up from the city, they have no idea. They complain about the siren blowing. It's hard and it's going to get harder.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 29, 2000, Thursday  A picture caption last Thursday with the continuation of an article about the dwindling numbers of volunteer firefighters nationwide misidentified a professional firefighter in Rye, N.Y., who was shown talking to a volunteer. He was Hal Aken, not John Castelhano.</p>
