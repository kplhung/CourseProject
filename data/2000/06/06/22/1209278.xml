        <p>Shades for Bulbs</p>
        <p>Q. For several autumns, I have put in a lot of bulbs. They are gorgeous in spring, but then there is the inevitable dying foliage to look at. I've tried the obvious day lilies to come up and hide it. Would other plants work as well as screens without coming up so early that they would interfere with the blooms?</p>
        <p>A. As a reward for not cutting the bulb foliage down before it yellows and depriving the bulbs of all the food-making ability they need to prepare for next year's bloom, here are a few suggestions for plants that will serve as great-looking minglers while hiding the bulb foliage until it dies down: astilbe, Siberian iris, the pale pink Geranium macrorrhizum Ingwersen's Variety or any of the medium-size hostas, including Emily Dickinson, Dorset Blue, Happy Hearts, Bright Lights and Gold Edger. You might also try Stachys Countess Helene von Stein, also known as Big Ears (the plant, not the countess).</p>

        <p>The Other Rhododendrons</p>
        <p>Q. I love rhododendrons, can't get enough of them. Someone told me recently that there is one that actually blooms in midsummer. Is this true? Is it as beautiful as the ones that bloom in the spring?</p>
        <p>A. If you measure beauty by a flower's size and its ability to blind through brightness, as so many rhododendron lovers seem to, then the good news is tinged with bad. The really showy rhododendrons seem to bloom themselves out in spring.</p>
        <p>But if you don't need that much candlepower to be impressed, and you remember that azaleas are rhododendrons, you can extend the flowering season by turning to some of the more subtle, delicately refined native azaleas. They belong to the same genus, but their side of the family hasn't been bred into circus clowns. In addition to offering more variety of bloom time, the deciduous azaleas add great fall foliage color.</p>
        <p>Sweet azalea (Rhododendron arborescens) is a large, informal shrub with lustrous dark green foliage and, from June into July, heliotrope-like fragrant flowers in white to light pink. Other forms have smoky pink or yellow flowers. The exceptionally sweet-smelling Florida hammock sweet azalea (R. serrulatum) also blooms from June into July. The flowers are small and white to pale pink. Finally, August brings the small orange-red to red flowers of plumleaf azalea (R. prunifolium).</p>
        <p>Sources for native azaleas include Woodlanders, 1128 Colleton Avenue, Aiken, S.C. 29801, (803) 648-7522, catalog $2; and Whitney Gardens and Nursery, P.O. Box 170, Brinnon, Wash. 98320, (360) 796-4411, catalog $4.</p>
        <p>Looking Like Mom</p>
        <p>Q. Do the progeny of weeping trees also weep, or is weeping produced by some other means?</p>
        <p>A. It depends on the tree, and on what you mean by ''progeny.'' Weeping trees, whose branches defy logic by hanging downward instead of reaching for the sun, are mutations. The trees may be grafted, but they are not, as a sculptor friend of mine slyly insists, grafted upside down. Even novelty-hungry growers aren't doing that quite yet.</p>
        <p>The mutations happen naturally on a single branch of a tree that otherwise grows normally. Buds from these weeping branches can be grafted onto hardier rootstock to extend their growing range, or cuttings from the branches can be rooted on their own. Such vegetative propagation will result in weeping progeny.</p>
        <p>Planting seeds, however, is problematic. The offspring of most mutations revert back to the original form, so the odds of getting a weeping tree are less than fifty-fifty. But there are trees, like the weeping willow, whose seeds will reliably produce chips off the old block.</p>
