        <p>The private company that runs the nation's only two uranium enrichment plants said today that it would close one of them in a year, in Portsmouth, Ohio, because of high costs and a depressed market for reactor fuel.</p>
        <p>The other plant, which is in Paducah, Ky., would remain open.</p>
        <p>But the decision to close the Ohio plant, which would eliminate about 1,000 jobs, drew criticism from Congress. The Energy Department, which sold the plants two years ago, has asked pointed questions recently about whether a shutdown is advisable. Under the privatization law, the plants were supposed to remain open until 2004, but there was an escape clause if the private entity, the United States Enrichment Corporation, fell into financial difficulties. The Bethesda, Md., company told the Treasury Department earlier this week that it had done exactly that.</p>
        <p>Until the company's board acted today, workers, managers and elected officials in the area of both plants had been apprehensive.</p>
        <p>''We deeply regret having to take this action, but we clearly could not continue to operate two production plants,'' William H. Timbers, the president and chief executive, said in a statement. He said he would ask the government to hire many of the workers for environmental restoration at the site.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department, however, issued a critical statement. ''The decision is just the latest in a series of shortsighted decisions aimed at bolstering the corporation's near-term standing on Wall Street,'' said the Energy Secretary, Bill Richardson. ''The decision announced today leaves unanswered fundamental questions affecting the employees, the corporation's future and USEC's ability to carry out important national security obligations to the United States.''</p>
        <p>The security obligation is a reference to a deal struck between the United States and Russia, to take highly enriched uranium from the former Soviet weapons program and dilute it for use in reactors in this country. The company, continuing to carry out the deal after the federal government sold the factories, agreed to a price that is now well above the market level.</p>
        <p>Representative Ted Strickland, Democrat of Ohio, whose district includes the plant, said he would ask the Treasury Department to seek an injunction against closing the plant. Among other problems, he said, if Portsmouth is closed and the Russians prove to be an unreliable supplier, the Paducah plant would not have sufficient capacity to provide for the American nuclear industry.</p>
        <p>He added that he is preparing legislation to renationalize the uranium enrichment business.</p>
        <p>Both the plants take in uranium in the two most common forms, uranium-238 and uranium-235, and sort them to raise the proportion of uranium-235, the type that is most useful in nuclear reactors. The enrichment technology used at both plants was developed during World War II, to make the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. That technology uses far more electricity than newer systems developed in Europe and the former Soviet Union, which are now commercial competitors.</p>
        <p>And the market for enrichment has also been depressed by the deal with the Russians.</p>
        <p>The Paducah plant, 16 miles west of the Kentucky city, was built between 1951 and 1954 on a 5,000-acre site. The Portsmouth plant, which is just south of Piketon, Ohio, in the southern part of the state, was built between 1952 and 1956. A third cold-war-era gaseous diffusion plant, at Oak Ridge, Tenn., was shut by the government in 1985.</p>
