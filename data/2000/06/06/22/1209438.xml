        <p>Tab Ramos has been one of the most skillful American players in recent years but has been hampered by injuries for the last two seasons. The MetroStars suffered last year when Ramos was limited to five games, and finished with a record of 7-25, the worst in Major League Soccer.</p>
        <p>Ramos is now healthy, and the small midfielder scored his first goal in almost two years tonight in a 2-2 tie with the defending champion D.C. United before a crowd of 10,316 at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>''He's in command on the field,'' Coach Octavio Zambrano said. ''His fitness level is much better. He has the ability to take people on and create dangerous situations.''</p>
        <p>The tie was the first of the season for the MetroStars, who have just one loss in their last five games. With a record of 7-7-1 (22 points), they were within 4 points of the Eastern Division-leading New England Revolution.</p>
        <p>''Can you believe I played the whole game and the overtime?'' Ramos said after playing sparingly for almost two years because of leg injuries, including reconstructive surgery on his right knee. ''It feels good to play a whole game.''</p>
        <p>The MetroStars were still without Lothar Matthaus, who will rejoin the team on Sunday after missing six league games playing for Germany in the European championships. Matthaus played in his 150th game for Germany on Tuesday, a 3-0 loss to Portugal, that eliminated Germany from the tournament.</p>
        <p>Ramos scored in the 23rd minute with a low shot to the right corner from 22 yards out after a square pass from the left by Adolfo Valencia, who did well to hold the ball until three D.C. United players converged to his side. That opened up space in the top of the penalty area for Ramos, who had time and space for his first goal since Sept. 18, 1998.</p>
        <p>Clint Mathis scored the first goal for the MetroStars in the 18th minute when he stepped into the path of a free kick by Ramos from the left side and headed the ball into the net. It was the fourth goal for Mathis in six games since his arrival from Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>D.C. United dominated action in the second half and should have scored more than the goals by Chris Albright in the 51st minute and Jaime Moreno in the 86th. Both goals came after poor decisions by the MetroStars' defenders and goalkeeper Mike Ammann. After D.C. United tied the game, it had a chance to win it a minute later but A. J. Wood's header hit the cross bar.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars were disorganized on defense in the late stages of the game and were lucky to escape without a loss. All of their defenders were ineffective and were often saved by the defensive play of Ramos and Mathis.</p>
        <p>D.C. United (3-11-4), a three-time league champion, earned its 13th point of the season, but remains in last place in the Eastern Division.</p>
        <p>''It's really disappointing that we let them back into the game,'' Ramos said. ''We could have buried this team with a victory, but we let them back in and we were lucky not to lose at the end.''</p>
