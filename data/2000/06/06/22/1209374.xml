        <p>Think of running for statewide office in New York as a series of treacherous political calculations. Especially if you are a Republican in a Democratic state. Especially when it comes to gay rights, at a time when your party wants to show a tolerant face, as you collect support from conservatives not often sympathetic to gay causes.</p>
        <p>Do you, for example, campaign through the dairy farms around Saratoga, and thus shore up critical upstate support? Or march down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan with thousands of gays and lesbians for the Heritage of Pride parade and thereby show an effort to reach out to voters not normally considered your base?</p>

        <p>Think of running for statewide office in New York as a series of treacherous political calculations. Especially if you are a Republican in a Democratic state. Especially when it comes to gay rights, at a time when your party wants to show a tolerant face, as you collect support from conservatives not often sympathetic to gay causes.</p>
        <p>Do you, for example, campaign through the dairy farms around Saratoga, and thus shore up critical upstate support? Or march down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan with thousands of gays and lesbians for the Heritage of Pride parade and thereby show an effort to reach out to voters not normally considered your base?</p>
        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio -- he of conservative backing but a generally moderate record in Congress -- is facing such choices in his bid for the United States Senate, one of a number of decisions that gays and lesbians within his party and out are closely watching. Not to mention nongay voters, in a race that polls have indicated is essentially tied. This time, he chose the cows. And now, naturally, comes the noise.</p>
        <p>His opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a speech to Bronx County Democrats last night briefly mentioned his decision not to march as an example of the differences between their campaigns. And a group of gay advocates ridiculed his choice on the steps of City Hall as proof that he was a conservative in moderate clothing. And even some surprised Republicans questioned the decision, albeit quietly, as something that, in the words of one, ''would not help Rick Lazio in the gay community,'' adding: ''Their support is neutral at best. But it would not hurt him with his own constituency. There was no downside to this.''</p>
        <p>Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, said the candidate should be judged not on attendance at one parade but on what he considered a solid voting record in Congress on issues of concern to gays and lesbians.</p>
        <p>Of course, it is not just the parade that has people worked up. His decision not to march comes amid a series of tests in recent days on gay rights, an issue that his party has long wrestled with.</p>
        <p>Gay supporters in his party are watching what stance he may take -- none as of last night -- on a bill the Senate passed Tuesday that would make hate attacks on gays a federal crime. House Republican leaders are expected to try to kill it, though there is some feeling that it may come up for a vote before Election Day. Mr. McLagan said Mr. Lazio would wait to see what version, if any, came up in the House before stating an opinion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who has declined to co-sponsor previous legislation in the House related to hate crimes, said he backed a hate crimes bill that passed in the Republican-controlled State Senate two weeks ago. It is expected to sail through the Democratic-controlled Assembly and be signed by Gov. George E. Pataki, a moderate Republican who is trumpeting Mr. Lazio's candidacy. Mr. Lazio declared his support only after the bill passed and after first wavering on whether he supported it.</p>
        <p>Gays make up an estimated 5 to 7 percent of the New York electorate, sizable enough to influence a very tight race. But that may not be the point.</p>
        <p>Republicans, sensitive to charges of right-wing extremism, have been moving toward the center in recent years and have taken steps to show tolerance as a way to draw independent and ''swing'' voters who hold no strong allegiance to either party.</p>
        <p>Richard Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay political organization based in Washington, said a remarkable shift has occurred in that candidates across the country now reach out to a group they had previously shunned. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas met with gay political representatives last year in what Mr. Tafel termed an unprecedented meeting for a presumptive Republican presidential nominee. The New York chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans exulted last month over acceptance of its first delegation to a state-nominating convention and has posted a picture on its Web site of its chapter leader shaking hands with William D. Powers, the state Republican chairman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, Mr. Tafel said, has a mixed voting record on issues of concern to gays, consistently supporting financing for several federal AIDS programs, for example, while declining to co-sponsor the hate crimes legislation in the House.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he said, Mr. Lazio has faithfully attended Log Cabin briefings and is generally seen as a friend to the group; the president of the New York chapter said it had been promised a meeting with Mr. Lazio within the next few weeks.</p>
        <p>''Gay Democrats are attacking him more out of loyalty to their party,'' he said. ''This is partisan politics and not gay politics.''</p>
        <p>Given the new resolve among Republicans to tap gay voters, some analysts find Mr. Lazio's rough going on recent gay issues perplexing.</p>
        <p>This all comes as Mr. Lazio balances an effort to bolster his moderate credentials, which have been attacked by Mrs. Clinton, while his conservative ones stand out. His campaign manager is Bill Dal Col, who directed the presidential campaigns of Steve Forbes, who last year declined to make a special effort to reach gay voters. His political director is Eileen Long, the daughter of Michael Long, the chairman of the Conservative Party, which is not known for favoring gay causes.</p>
        <p>Some political analysts, acknowledging the perilous calculations that candidates must make in such a diverse state, said Mr. Lazio, both with his refusal to attend the parade and his ambiguity on the hate crimes legislation, risks alienating voters who see acceptance of gays as a sign of tolerance.</p>
        <p>''It strikes me as bizarre in terms of political calculus,'' said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor of political science at Hunter College who has written on the role of gays in politics. ''It's not as if the hard-core social conservatives have anywhere else to go; they are not going to support Hillary Clinton. It probably makes more sense to take them for granted and go after the contested votes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio clearly intends to do that -- upstate is a battleground and he plans an ambitious effort there, as this weekend is intended to prove -- but perhaps not in the way those attuned to gay concerns expected.</p>
        <p>''I think it's another very ambiguous message he sends to lesbians and gays,'' said Jeff Soref, a co-chairman of Empire State Pride Agenda, a nonpartisan gay political group. ''I have to say a decision like this one on the parade and his waffling on hate crimes makes it harder to see him as an inclusive senator that I think at this point is right for New York.''</p>
        <p>Others, including the moderate Republican that Mr. Lazio replaced in the Senate race, said the candidate deserved some slack.</p>
        <p>''People can't march in every parade,'' said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who plans to march in the Heritage of Pride parade, as he does every year, even though he is often heckled. ''There are lots of schedules they have when they run for office. So I wouldn't decide for a candidate what parade to march in.''</p>
