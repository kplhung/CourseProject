        <p>Since its inception in 1963 the most successful charity game in the world has taken place in New York City. This month it was played at the Harmonie Club, 4 East 60th Street, Manhattan, and raised $84,000 for UJA-Federation, which supports Jewish charitable efforts in New York, Israel and around the world. The chief organizer was Marci Miron, with help from one of the founders, Tubby Stayman. The event was in memory of Alfred Rand, long a familiar bridge figure in New York, and was underwritten by his widow, Rita Rand.</p>
        <p>The winners were Beverly Perry and Jon Greenspan, with Frances Platzer and Rick Zucker in second place. On the diagramed deal North was excessively silent after South opened with two hearts, weak.

        <p>Since its inception in 1963 the most successful charity game in the world has taken place in New York City. This month it was played at the Harmonie Club, 4 East 60th Street, Manhattan, and raised $84,000 for UJA-Federation, which supports Jewish charitable efforts in New York, Israel and around the world. The chief organizer was Marci Miron, with help from one of the founders, Tubby Stayman. The event was in memory of Alfred Rand, long a familiar bridge figure in New York, and was underwritten by his widow, Rita Rand.</p>
        <p>The winners were Beverly Perry and Jon Greenspan, with Frances Platzer and Rick Zucker in second place. On the diagramed deal North was excessively silent after South opened with two hearts, weak. Anyone who plays a two-spade response as nonforcing had an opportunity here, but that style is out of fashion, and North passed.</p>
        <p>When East reopened with a double, and West passed for penalties, North should surely have tried two spades. That contract, if doubled, would have failed by two tricks, for 300, so East-West would have had to settle for the normal three no-trump contract, making 11 tricks. North should have reasoned that two hearts was certainly a 6-0 fit facing a bad split. Two spades was unlikely to be worse and was very likely to be better. North was perhaps influenced by a desire to have an expert partner play the hand, but silence is not always golden at the bridge table.</p>
        <p>In two hearts doubled, Greenspan and Perry, East and West, needed to collect nine tricks to outscore the pairs making three no-trump. A diamond was led, and the heart nine was returned to the king and ace. A second diamond was won by East, who led his remaining trump.</p>
        <p>South won with the queen and tried a club to the king. East took the ace and played the spade king, driving out dummy's ace. The defenders had to score three tricks in the black suits and two more trump tricks, giving them the 800 points they needed for a top score.</p>
