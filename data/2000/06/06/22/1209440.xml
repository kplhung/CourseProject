        <p>Energy Secretary Bill Richardson endured a bipartisan storm of criticism today over his handling of the latest security breach at Los Alamos National Laboratory, even as he assured Congress that investigators now believed that the mysterious case of nuclear lost and found at the laboratory was not a result of espionage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson told a Senate hearing that the F.B.I. had determined that the two computer hard drives that were found last Friday behind a copying machine inside the laboratory were the same devices containing nuclear weapons data that had been missing from a Los Alamos vault.</p>
        <p>He and other officials said the F.B.I., which is working with a grand jury conducting a criminal investigation of the security lapse, had recovered fingerprints from the outer wrapping of the drives and from the area where they were discovered.</p>
        <p>The two hard drives held data on American and foreign nuclear weapons and were intended for use by the government's Nuclear Emergency Search Team, a sort of SWAT team responsible for disarming nuclear weapons in an emergency.</p>
        <p>The drives, stored in locked kits inside a vault in the laboratory's X Division, which designs nuclear weapons, may have disappeared as early as March 28, officials said today. But their loss was not reported to the laboratory's director until May 31.</p>
        <p>The F.B.I., which was notified on June 1 about the hard drives' disappearance, is now focusing on a handful of the 26 employees who had unrestricted access to the vault.  Three people have already failed F.B.I. polygraphs and have given contradictory answers about their knowledge of the hard drives, officials say.</p>
        <p>The F.B.I. does not believe the hard drives were ever moved out of the X Division, officials added.</p>
        <p>''I am pleased that the F.B.I. has authenticated'' the drives, Mr. Richardson said today. ''I am pleased, too, that it appears that they did not leave the X Division. I am pleased that there does not appear to be espionage.''</p>
        <p>Still, there was little about today that was pleasing to Mr. Richardson.</p>
        <p>His appearance before the Senate Armed Services Committee quickly turned into a grilling. Lawmakers were incredulous when Los Alamos and Energy Department officials, testifying with Mr. Richardson, said there were no rules preventing certain laboratory employees from signing the hard drives out or from walking out with the hard drives. Officials said the rules were being quickly changed for the laboratory.</p>
        <p>Yet officials also acknowledged that because the hard drives were  classified secret, rather than top secret, they could be sent by regular mail to another federal building.</p>
        <p>The practice of sending secret material through the mail led to another security incident at the Energy Department about eight months ago, officials said today, but they refused to describe it in detail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson was assailed by lawmakers of both parties today.</p>
        <p>While Republicans renewed their calls for Mr. Richardson to resign, one of the most senior Democratic senators said the energy secretary had shown contempt toward Congress by failing to appear at a Senate hearing last week to explain the disappearance of the hard drives.</p>
