      <abstract>
        <p>Letter by Mildred Zero responds to June 15 article on technology to keep drunk drivers off road; says all autos should be equipped with interlock technology devices</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>There can't be many better uses of technology than the interlock device that keeps people convicted of drunken driving out of the driver's seat if they have been drinking (''Device Helps Keep D.W.I. Offenders and Others Safe,'' June 15). The question is why we must wait for a drunken driver to be apprehended before protecting others from his recklessness? If, as the article states, ''most first offenders drive while intoxicated up to 600 times before they are caught,'' it seems obvious that no car should be on the road without this device.</p>
