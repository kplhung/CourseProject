        <p>John Rocker, a Major League Baseball official said yesterday, has made the No. 7 train more famous than Duke Ellington's A train.</p>
        <p>Ellington took the A train to Harlem; Rocker says he is going to take the No. 7 train to Shea Stadium. Major League Baseball, though no official said it publicly, does not want Rocker, the Atlanta relief pitcher, riding any subway to the Braves' games with the Mets next week. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said the city would try to prevail on him not to take the train and on the Braves not to let him take the train.</p>
        <p>But one of the Braves' top executives said yesterday that it was Rocker's business to get to Shea by the transportation of his choice.</p>
        <p>''I haven't discussed it, nor will I discuss it'' with Rocker, John Schuerholz, the Braves' general manager, said by telephone from Atlanta when asked about the closer's stated intention. ''It's a nonissue for me. Guys travel to the ballpark however they like.''</p>
        <p>Darryl Hamilton, the Mets' center fielder, who is on the disabled list, said he did not think Rocker would use the subway. ''There are too many security risks involved,'' Hamilton said. ''On the baseball field, you've got some type of protection. If you're talking about riding the subway, you are on someone else's turf. I still can't understand why the guy is bringing more attention to himself than is needed. Get four games over with, and get out of here.''</p>
        <p>It appeared Rocker might miss the Braves' four-game visit to New York when he was banished to the minor leagues earlier this month, to work on his control, the club said. But his demotion came a day after he harangued the Sports Illustrated reporter who wrote the article quoting him as disparaging large segments of society, including some that ride the No. 7 train in New York City.</p>
        <p>The prevailing view was that Rocker would not return to the Braves in time for the series starting next Thursday, if he would rejoin them at all. But then another reliever, Rudy Seanez, was injured, and Rocker returned.</p>
        <p>His initial relief appearances show that his control has not improved; last night, he allowed five runs to the Cubs in a 20-ball, 10-strike outing in which he issued four walks and hit a batter.</p>
        <p>Rocker told USA Today Baseball Weekly this week: ''The first day I get to New York, I'm getting on the 7 train. I'm taking it to Shea Stadium. I won't be in a cab. I won't be on the bus. I'll be on that train. And I'm looking forward to it.''</p>
        <p>Not in a car, not on the bus, not in a taxi with a driver named Gus. Security concerns have been high; if Rocker follows through with his plan to take the train to the game, baseball and city officials may be in a state of consternation.</p>
        <p>''Whatever Mr. Rocker chooses to do, the N.Y.P.D. will be prepared and will have adequate coverage,'' said Marilyn Mode, a spokeswoman for the Police Department.</p>
        <p>Speaking yesterday at his daily news conference, this one in Central Park, Giuliani said: ''We thought when he went down to the minor leagues that this was something we could wait on. But now he is back. So we have been preparing a plan, and we will probably announce it tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Later, in an interview on WFAN, Giuliani said 450 to 500 police officers, including some in plainclothes, would be at Shea for the games. He suggested that officers will be on the train, too, if Rocker is. For a regular game, police officials said, the Shea detail consists of 1 lieutenant, 4 sergeants and 40 police officers.</p>
        <p>''We're going to have security watching him to make sure nothing happens to him,'' the mayor said, adding that the city would treat the pitcher the way it would a visiting head of state ''or someone from a foreign country and there are threats toward him.''</p>
        <p>The Braves, while not taking the visit and potential problems lightly, have tried to give the appearance that everything is normal.</p>
        <p>Asked yesterday about team security, Schuerholz said: ''We're just doing what we normally would do. Whatever extra protection we take to certain places, that's what we'll do.''</p>
        <p>Is New York one of those places? ''Yes, it is,'' he said. ''But that's just standard procedure for us, nothing beyond our extra efforts.''</p>
        <p>The Braves play in Montreal just before their trip to New York, and Kevin Hallinan, baseball's executive director for security, will meet with them there to review plans.</p>
        <p>Shea Stadium is expected to be packed or nearly packed for the games. The Mets said the advance sale for three of the games is about 35,000. The Friday night game is close to a sellout. That game will be followed by fireworks. Baseball and city officials hope those are the only fireworks that explode during the series.</p>
