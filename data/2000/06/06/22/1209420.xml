        <p>It would not have mattered in the seventh inning tonight if the Yankees had Juan Gonzalez or Sammy Sosa or both. It would not have mattered if they had fielded nine superstars and recruited five future Hall of Famers to cheer them from the bench.</p>
        <p>Nothing else matters when pitchers do not throw strikes.</p>
        <p>Jason Grimsley and Mike Stanton are two of the reasons the Yankees are still in first place despite their maddeningly inconsistent play, but tonight, Grimsley and Stanton were the reasons the Yankees are not in a position to sweep the four-game series from the Red Sox. The relievers walked five batters in the seventh inning, including four in a row, and that helped propel the Boston Red Sox to a 9-7 victory.</p>
        <p>''We made a gift,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager. ''You have to make teams beat you, and it didn't happen.''</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, watched from a box, occasionally drawing a cell phone to his ear, perhaps to hear the latest on the trade talks for Gonzalez and Sosa.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are 36-30, a half-game ahead of the Red Sox (36-31). The rookie Jake Westbrook, who did not survive the second inning in his first start, will make his second start Thursday night, against Boston's Ramon Martinez.</p>
        <p>David Cone has not won a decision since April, but he could have won tonight; he probably should have. Summer arrived here, shoved by a wind that blew strongly over the left-field wall at Fenway Park, across the Charles River, and it was because of the wind that Bernie Williams misplayed a long fly ball in the first inning, costing the Yankees a run. The gusts probably aided the Red Sox in the sixth, when two batters hit balls into the tail wind and against the left-field wall.</p>
        <p>But Cone, whose fastball reached 89 to 90 miles an hour consistently, threw effectively, and when the Yankees scored three runs in the top of the seventh, he was in position to pick up his second victory of the year, the 182nd of his career.</p>
        <p>Cone threw 101 pitches in the first six innings, just about the limit the Yankees' staff has held him to, and Grimsley jogged out of the bullpen to pitch the bottom of the seventh, his record 3-1, his earned run average 3.02, solid all year. Nomar Garciaparra opened the inning for the Red Sox with a single, and it was not necessarily a problem; Grimsley throws a hard sinking fastball and gets lots of ground balls and double plays.</p>
        <p>Preparing to pitch to Carl Everett, he glanced over his left shoulder at Garciaparra. Torre would say later that Grimsley became too concerned with holding the Red Sox runner at first, but Grimsley did not think so. He threw his first pitch to Everett low, the next three high, walking him.</p>
        <p>''I just didn't find that in-between spot,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Now the Yankees' lead was in jeopardy. Both runners advanced on Mike Stanley's sharp grounder to third -- Scott Brosius made a diving play, rose and threw to first for the first out -- and Garciaparra scored the tying run when Scott Hatteberg smashed a grounder to second.</p>
        <p>Grimsley then walked the pinch-hitter Brian Daubach. First and third and two out. But Grimsley walked Manny Alexander, the No. 9 hitter, loading the bases, and Torre was on the move, calling for Stanton as he walked out of the dugout.</p>
        <p>Stanton said he felt good in the bullpen throwing his warm-ups. There were no symptoms of the wildness that has overcome him from time to time in his career, those moments when he begins to rush and his front shoulder in his delivery -- his right shoulder -- flies to the right and drags his left arm through his motion, like a tin can dangling from a string off the back of a pickup truck. Stanton had just six walks in 32 2/3 innings this year.</p>
        <p>But his first two pitches to Jose Offerman were out of the strike zone, and he seemed to be rushing. Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher, jogged to the mound. ''Look, you're trying too hard,'' Posada told him.</p>
        <p>Stanton kept trying and trying. He threw Ball 3; the fans at Fenway roared, and even louder when he threw Ball 4, forcing home the go-ahead run. Then Stanton walked Jeff Frye, jabbing at the air with his left arm the moment he threw the last ball.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox led, 7-5, and added two runs when Trot Nixon ripped a two-run double off Stanton. It would not matter that Williams slugged a two-run shot in the Yankee ninth.</p>
        <p>Both Grimsley and Stanton waited for reporters after the game, Stanton with his arms folded across his chest, Grimsley sitting in a chair with an empty look on his face. Between them, they had thrown 30 pitches in the innings, 10 strikes.</p>
        <p>''When you get to this level, you have to make adjustments,'' Stanton said, ''and I simply did not make adjustments. It's nobody's fault but myself. We should've won this game.</p>
        <p>''I got out there, threw a couple of pitches out of the zone and got frustrated, and I did not step back and make an adjustment.''</p>
        <p>Said Grimsley: ''To not give yourself a chance by not throwing the ball over the plate, that's irritating.''</p>
        <p>And costly. The Yankees could have won the first three games of this series, built big-time momentum, and kicked another dent in the Red Sox. But now they could be out of first place by the time they leave here late Thursday.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>ORLANDO HERNANDEZ (sprained elbow) won't be able to resume throwing for three days, meaning that the Yankees may have to call up a pitcher from Class AAA Columbus for Friday's game in Chicago. BEN FORD, currently with Columbus, could be called up to pitch, too. If JASON GRIMSLEY is not needed in relief Thursday, he could make his fourth emergency start of the year.</p>
