      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Pottery Barn, which brings high-priced design to the mass market, has done it again -- twice. The Paris Cubes, below, and the Bamboo Armoire, below right, available in August through stores and catalogs, are similar to other companies' designs. Coach, the New York City leather company, introduced the Manhattan Small Ottoman, above, in January last year and in May of last year, Interieurs, a Manhattan shop, brought out its bamboo armoire, right. Although Celia Tejada, vice president of product design at Pottery Barn, knew of Coach's and Interieurs' designs, she said, ''We were absolutely not influenced by Coach, and we were not inspired by Interieurs.'' The pieces merely extended the company's line of furniture, she said. Heidi Harvey, an intellectual property lawyer at Fish &amp; Richardson, a Boston law firm, said, ''You can make designs that are similar, but you can't go so far as to confuse the public between the original high-end design, and the second, mass market design.'' How do they differ? A Pottery Barn Cube 19 1/2 by 19 1/2 by 17 1/2 inches in brown cow leather costs $399. Coach's Ottoman (18 by 18 by 15) starts at $990 and comes in seven leather treatments. Pottery Barn's mass-produced bamboo armoire (43 inches wide, 70 inches tall) is $1,450, Interieurs' handmade bamboo, maple and steel armoire (48 inches wide, 67 inches tall) is $10,970. Pottery Barn: (800) 922-5507. Coach: (800) 262-2411; Interieurs: (212) 343-2201.</p>
