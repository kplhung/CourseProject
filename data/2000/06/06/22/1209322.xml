        <p>Some of the old soldiers were unsteady as they stood at attention today while a bugler blew taps into a fresh breeze in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns.</p>
        <p>The youngest of them were in their mid-70's, after all. Some had come thousands of miles for this dress-blue ceremony under a gray sky, so it was no surprise that their shoulders sagged under the weight of years and, perhaps, of memories.</p>
        <p>There were seven old soldiers in Arlington National Cemetery. One was well known, Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, the others much less so. All have just been awarded the Medal of Honor, the country's highest military award, for what they did more than a half-century ago.</p>
        <p>The seven are among 22 Asian-Americans, most of Japanese descent, who fought heroically during World War II as their relatives endured prejudice, even internment, back home. Most of the 22 belonged to the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, which sustained heavy casualties in Italy, France and Germany.</p>
        <p>''They rose above any sense of personal injustice to sacrifice all that they held dear in order to keep our country strong,'' Army Secretary Louis Caldera said before the Arlington ceremony in their honor.</p>
        <p>Heroism? Not really, said one of the seven, Barney Hajiro, now 83.</p>
        <p>''I forgot myself in combat,'' Mr. Hajiro said. ''I couldn't run backward. I had to run forward. That's the job of a soldier.''</p>
        <p>Private Hajiro of the 442nd killed several German soldiers and helped capture more than a dozen others in eastern France in October 1944.</p>
        <p>The 442nd fought in many campaigns and garnered many medals. But as the years went by and prejudice faded, people in and out of the military asked why only two Asian-Americans were awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism in World War II. (No black soldiers received the Medal of Honor.)</p>
        <p>The Army reviewed more than 100 instances in which the Distinguished Service Cross, the second-highest medal, was given to Asian-Americans. Last month, the Army concluded that in 21 instances the Medal of Honor should have been awarded instead. (More recently, a member of the 442nd who had won another high honor, the Silver Star, was found worthy of a Medal of Honor.)</p>
        <p>Eight of the 22 were killed in action, and others have succumbed to time. Many relatives of the dead were at the tomb today, some leaning on canes or on the strong arms of honor guard soldiers young enough to be their grandchildren.</p>
        <p>George T. Sakato, another of the seven, was a private with the 442nd. According to his medal citation, he  killed five German soldiers and captured four on Oct. 29, 1944, before his unit was pinned down. Then he led ''a one-man rush,'' killing as many as a dozen more enemy soldiers and capturing several others.</p>
        <p>Not particularly heroic, said Mr. Sakato, 79. ''Nowadays, they call what I did 'road rage,' '' he said. His killing rampage for his country was inspired by the death of a buddy, Saburo Tanamachi.</p>
        <p>''He died in my arms,'' Mr. Sakato said with a distant look in his eyes.</p>
        <p>As a 20-year-old first lieutenant in the 442nd, Daniel Inouye led an attack in Italy in April 1945 in which two dozen enemy soldiers were killed. His right arm was shattered and had to be amputated.</p>
        <p>The seven old soldiers, their relatives and survivors of the dead Medal of Honor recipients went to the White House this afternoon to meet President Clinton and get their medals. On Thursday, the 22 will be honored at a Pentagon ceremony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sakato lives in Denver and is a retired postal worker. He recalled how, early in the war, his family was given three days to leave their home in Southern California or face internment. They went to Arizona to live with relatives. After he came home from the war, Mr. Sakato felt the stares whenever he entered a restaurant, ''from people thinking, 'What are you doing here?' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hajiro is from Waipahu, Hawaii, and went back to the islands to work on a sugar plantation after leaving the Army. Memories of Pearl Harbor were still vivid.</p>
        <p>''Even after the war,'' he said, ''they called me a 'Jap,' you know.''</p>
