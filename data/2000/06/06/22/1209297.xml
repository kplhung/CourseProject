        <p>THERE are those who need furniture, and there are those who like furniture. I count myself in the second category.</p>
        <p>Which is why I commissioned a piece. I saw a small writing table in a shop window in Paris, walked in on an impulse, negotiated a variation in a different wood, and walked out with a remarkably satisfying sensation. I now had on order a folding table for working at my laptop, a beautiful burnt oak square on waxed steel legs, as nicely turned as a phrase.</p>
        <p>It was a piece of furniture unique to me. Twelve weeks later, the table arrived, and I was Lorenzo de Medici for a day. I had even relished the wait.</p>
        <p>For anyone unsatisfied by the styles, quality or similarity of mass-produced furniture, or frustrated by the prices of vintage furniture, commissioning a piece produces furniture specific to your tastes and needs.</p>
        <p>In some cases, it is an opportunity to work with an architect on a project smaller than a house. In other cases, it solves a problem that can't be solved with existing furniture. Commissioning custom work can be comparable to the cost and delivery time of more expensive, mass-produced items. And it's cheaper than antiques.</p>
        <p>People interested in design come to the decision to participate in it in a variety of ways. They include the New York City couple who wanted innovative, not generic, furniture for their two young children, and a woman in New Hampshire with a keen eye for 18th-century antiques who found most new traditional American furniture devoid of grace and skill.</p>
        <p>Emily Woods, chairwoman and co-founder of J. Crew, who makes style for a living, knew exactly what she needed to perfect her Chelsea loft, and she knew she would never find it.</p>
        <p>''I had a picture in my mind of what I wanted, so I designed it,'' she said. ''It's exactly what's sitting in my living room.'' Ms. Woods, whose 20th-century furniture collection includes a Charlotte Perriand oak and steel table that in part inspired her commissions, hired two young New York architects, Louise Harpman and Scott Specht, to design a dining table and a sideboard. ''I didn't want the place to be all old pieces,'' she explained.</p>
        <p>The first assignment, a monumental dining table with a companion bench, was dictated by 100-year-old oak timbers Ms. Woods located in Colorado. The architects presented over a dozen designs, in drawings and models.</p>
        <p>''She whittled through them and found the ones that seemed more perfect for her,'' Mr. Specht said. The architects built a full-scale cardboard mock-up, calibrating it by eye to fit the space precisely. The table is 12 feet 4 inches by 3 feet 6 inches; a steel undercarriage supports the sweeping span of oak that appears, like a magician's assistant, to float.</p>
        <p>Ms. Woods also commissioned a sideboard. She showed the architects a kitchen drawer neatly organized with silverware and asked for a design as simple as that. The 9-foot-3-inch sideboard has 15 oak drawers, framed in steel, with finger-width gaps that serve as pulls. Because of difficulties in executing the design's length of steel, the piece took three tries and seven months.</p>
        <p>''It's thin welded steel,'' Mr. Specht said. ''It can wave and warp all over the place.'' The architect added a precautionary lesson: that every original piece of design is in essence an experiment.</p>
        <p>''It can take as long to design a piece of furniture as it does to design a whole house,'' Mr. Specht said. ''In order to do that, an architect has to charge a fee that's commensurate with the amount of work, so it can get expensive. And it takes time.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Harpman and Mr. Specht also worked recently on a project that involved a low budget, a tight schedule and a different kind of originality.</p>
        <p>James Schamus, a film producer and screenwriter, and Nancy Kricorian, a writer, commissioned furniture for their daughters Nona, 8, and Djuna, 4, only after shopping for it.</p>
        <p>''We didn't see anything that we thought was well made or beautiful, or that suited the uses of our kids,'' Ms. Kricorian said. Mr. Schamus asked the architects, who had designed his offices, to submit ideas.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Schamus and Ms. Kricorian got was an inordinate amount of architectural thinking for Nona's 12-by-16-foot bedroom and Djuna's 9-by-13-foot maid's room on the Upper West Side.</p>
        <p>Rolling carts with reversible chalkboard and Formica work surfaces house art supplies. Nona's lower bunk bed has rolling drawer storage below. Djuna's single bed has a rolling trundle bed beneath for guests. Built-in desk tops can be raised as the children grow.</p>
        <p>The project cost approximately $10,000, which included the gift of a good carpenter, Anthony Sandkamp.</p>
        <p>''He was meticulous,'' Ms. Kricorian said. ''That was my only complaint. Something would take hours. I would say, 'Tony, you have to leave now -- my children have to go to bed.' ''</p>
        <p>Compressing his crew into a single collaborator, Robert Cole, a freelance art director, worked with a carpenter who was also a designer, Eric Walton.</p>
        <p>''I like the late 1950's, but I didn't want this to look like the window of a SoHo shop,'' Mr. Cole said, speaking of his one-bedroom Greenwich Village apartment, which includes furniture by Florence Knoll and Hans Wegner. Instead of buying a bed, Mr. Cole had Mr. Walton build it, for both aesthetic and practical reasons.</p>
        <p>''I wanted it to look like two planes floating,'' Mr. Cole said; he also wanted handy storage and display for books. ''I did a drawing, which had no basis in reality,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walton recalled: ''I talked him out of exactly what he wanted to do. It wasn't that structurally sound.'' Mr. Cole established his budget, which was $3,000.</p>
        <p>The two men exchanged several increasingly detailed sets of drawings. Mr. Walton built a cardboard model to scale and suggested materials. Mr. Cole chose cherry wood. The minimal-looking project involved intricate joinery that Mr. Cole required be concealed. Mr. Walton said that constituted much of the cost. The process took two months.</p>
        <p>In Susan Cartun's case, a novel material provided the impetus to commission. When Ms. Cartun saw the resin-topped tables designed by Elizabeth Diller and Richard Scofidio for the newly renovated Brasserie restaurant on West 53rd Street, she did what any New Yorker would do -- she asked.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cartun played telephone: through the restaurant to the architects, she contacted Karen Atta, at Atta Inc., who fabricated the resin tabletops. Ten percent of her clients are individuals with requests for residential commissions. ''The cost of custom work is a little higher,'' Ms. Atta said, ''but it's in the same ballpark with higher-end commercial production. We give the client an estimate for the job right off the bat. We rarely have someone walk away.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cartun commissioned a 10-by-4-foot dining table top, which cost $7,000. (The $3,000 steel base was fabricated elsewhere.)</p>
        <p>''I'm very impressed with the durability of it,'' she said. ''We sat at the Brasserie with a fork and tried to scratch it. There was nothing ready-made in this polyresin.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cartun's tables were delivered last week after two months' work, well within the client's grace period.</p>
        <p>''You buy a piece of furniture from Europe and you wait 14 to 16 weeks,'' she said. ''And this is not what you're calling custom.''</p>
        <p>For many, the issue ultimately is craftsmanship. David Lamb, a woodworker based in Canterbury, N.H., and a member of the New Hampshire Furniture Masters Association, has built furniture for Harrison Ford, Ivan Lendl and Joan Farrel, who lives in neighboring Concord.</p>
        <p>Ms. Farrel, who also collects 18th-century American antiques, has commissioned three pieces from Mr. Lamb, including a $7,500 tiger-maple Queen Anne-style table, which took eight months to execute.</p>
        <p>''You go into a store and start checking it over, especially the tables,'' she said. ''It's out of sight what they want for it and the workmanship is pretty sad.''</p>
        <p>Thomas McLaughlin, also a New Hampshire furniture maker, explained that custom, handmade pieces didn't command the premium that many clients expected.</p>
        <p>Mr. McLaughlin makes a two-pedestal cherry-wood dining table with a base price of $5,580. Baker Furniture offers a two-pedestal table with a mahogany veneer in a comparable size for $5,433.</p>
        <p>''First-timers' biggest surprise is how they can have such a personal effect on the outcome,'' he said. ''We've all grown up in a post-industrial-revolution age. Awareness of furniture as an art is a forgotten thing.''</p>
        <p>John Hayes, head of the American furniture department at Christie's Americas, said he thought commissioning well-made, original furniture was also potentially an investment. ''It has a much higher prospect of being collected and acquired,'' he said, adding that he felt the spirit of the enterprise held truer, too.</p>
        <p>''In the 18th century, cabinetmakers were innovating all the time,'' he explained. ''And the patron and maker collaborated.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hayes summed up the pride in commissioning furniture, which can be visible in its design. I know. ''You're doing something that's alive,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Brains and Brawn</p>
        <p>COMMISSIONING a design and finding a craftsman can be as simple as asking: one carpenter receives referrals from lumber yards where he buys supplies. Trade associations, craft schools and specialized magazines also offer resources.</p>
