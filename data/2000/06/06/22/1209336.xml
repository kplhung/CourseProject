        <p>In many ways, Karrie Webb can relate to the dominance of Tiger Woods.</p>
        <p>The last time Webb played in a major championship, she won by 10 strokes. In 10 starts on the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour this year, Webb has four victories and nine top 10 finishes. And having won almost $1 million already this year, Webb appears headed for her third money title in the last five years.</p>
        <p>No wonder Webb feels confident heading into Thursday's opening round of the McDonald's L.P.G.A. Championship, the second women's major of the season. Webb has won the last two majors, last year's du Maurier Classic, and the Nabisco Championship in March, when she ran away from the field and defeated the second-place Dottie Pepper by 10 strokes.</p>
        <p>At age 25, and clearly the best player on her tour, Webb enters every tournament as the player to beat, just like Woods. However, Webb has learned to accept that it is difficult to grab the spotlight from Woods.</p>
        <p>''Because Tiger and my careers have paralleled so much, I think the L.P.G.A. probably has not gotten as much attention,'' said Webb, a native of Australia, who lives in Florida. ''My career has uncannily paralleled Tiger's, and I think it has hurt the L.P.G.A. somewhat. The attention has been to what he has been doing a little bit more.</p>
        <p>''It's something that I can't control. I think we can do with more publicity. The standard of golf out here has increased greatly in the five years that I've been out here. I think that it goes unnoticed. It's not until people are out there and actually watching us that they realize how good we play.''</p>
        <p>Webb is headlining a field that includes all of the L.P.G.A.'s top players. Juli Inkster clinched the career grand slam by winning last year's tournament, but don't expect Inkster's winning score of 16 under par to be matched this year. The 6,368-yard DuPont Country Club course has been toughened, with higher rough and faster greens.</p>
        <p>''The greens here are faster than I've ever seen them,'' said Nancy Lopez, an L.P.G.A. Hall of Fame player, who will be playing her first tournament since gallbladder surgery in April. ''You are going to have to stay below the hole. It's going to be tougher this year.''</p>
        <p>Webb already thought the course was tough. She has never won the McDonald's, missing the cut last year.</p>
        <p>Asked what she remembered about last year's tournament, Webb said: ''I had the weekend off. That's what I remember. I've never been in contention at this tournament before. I'm just trying to get myself in contention come Friday night, then see what happens from there.''</p>
        <p>If Webb is to win again, she will have to beat many players who have performed well recently. Annika Sorenstam defeated Webb in a playoff last week at the Evian Masters in France. It was Sorenstam's third victory this year, and it moved her to second on the money list behind Webb.</p>
        <p>The Webb-Sorenstam rivalry has been one of the L.P.G.A.'s best subplots for the past four years, with Sorenstam winning the money title in 1997 and 1998, while Webb won it in 1996 and last year. Sorenstam remembers what it was like to be the best player in women's golf, and at age 29, she is determined to be the best again.</p>
        <p>''Karrie right now is the No. 1 player, and when you beat somebody like that, it gives you confidence,'' Sorenstam said. ''It helps knowing your game is good enough to beat her. The motivation is there. I'm chasing somebody and know what I want. That's what drives me.''</p>
        <p>With a victory this weekend, Webb would become the first woman to win three consecutive majors since Pat Bradley won the 1985 du Maurier, the 1986 Nabisco and the 1986 L.P.G.A. Championship. Interestingly, Webb used to be criticized for her performance in majors. She played in 15 majors before finally winning her first one last year, and she admitted that her victory at the du Maurier last year relieved a burden.</p>
        <p>''I can't imagine the focus on me had I not won du Maurier last year,'' Webb said. ''It would have put a negative spin on what I had been doing.''</p>
        <p>Instead, Webb enters Thursday's first round with a chance to win another major. And if she succeeds, it will fuel talk that Webb could win all four majors this year. ''I think the four majors are the four biggest tournaments we play all year,'' she said. ''They carry the most prestige for winning. I regard the four majors as my top priority of the year.''</p>
