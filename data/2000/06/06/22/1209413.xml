        <p>The Senate endorsed an aid package of nearly $1 billion tonight to help Colombia equip and train security forces to combat drug traffickers in a country where the narcotics trade and guerrilla insurgency support each other.</p>
        <p>While the Senate delayed passing the legislation containing the aid until Thursday, that outcome was not in doubt, and senators completed the measures dealing with Colombia.</p>
        <p>The Senate has now set aside a total of almost $1.3 billion for assistance to Colombia over the next two years, counting $300 million in an earlier military bill. In late March, the House approved $1.7 billion over two years in emergency spending for the nation, one of Washington's most important Latin American allies.</p>
        <p>Anticipating important votes in the Senate today, House and Senate Republican leaders met this morning to discuss how to reconcile the two competing versions of the package, which have several crucial differences, and find a legislative vehicle for the eventual compromise that both chambers can vote on quickly, perhaps before the July 4 recess.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, President Clinton and President Andres Pastrana of Colombia have appealed to Congressional leaders to rush passage of an anti-drug plan to help Colombia and other Andean nations. The plan is backed by top Republican leaders like Representative J. Dennis Hastert, the House speaker, and Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia.</p>
        <p>''Colombia is the heart of the drug war, and we'd better get on with it,'' Mr. Coverdell said. ''If we lose in Colombia, then we lose everywhere.''</p>
        <p>But critics argued in debate today that the aid package would ensnare the United States in an open-ended conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives over 40 years.</p>
        <p>''The capacity of this body for self-delusion appears to this senator to be unlimited,'' said Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington.  ''There has been no consideration of the consequences, cost and length of involvement. This bill says, let's get into war now and justify it later.''</p>
        <p>The decisive votes today came on two amendments to reduce or shift some of the $934 million earmarked this year and next for Colombia in a foreign aid bill.</p>
        <p>By 89 to 11, senators defeated an amendment by Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, to transfer $225 million in aid from the Colombian military to drug treatment and prevention programs in the United States. The Senate then defeated, by 79-19, an amendment by Mr. Gorton to cut the aid package to $200 million, from $934 million.</p>
        <p>Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director, released the following statement today while traveling in Asia, anticipating the overall bill's final approval on Thursday: ''The Senate's work is a crucial step toward final Congressional approval of the package that will greatly enhance counterdrug efforts in Colombia and neighboring Andean countries in their struggle against illicit production and trafficking, and drug-funded criminal organizations.''</p>
        <p>In debate this week, senators have not disputed that the United States must help Colombia, which is the source of 90 percent of the cocaine and 65 percent of the heroin seized in this country. But critics have warned that Washington was being pulled more deeply into a civil conflict so convoluted that two leftist guerrilla armies are fighting the government, right-wing paramilitary forces are fighting the guerrillas, guerrillas are providing paid protection to drug traffickers, and civilians are trapped in the middle.</p>
        <p>''I recognize that Colombia is a country in crisis,'' said Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin. ''But we're not walking into this scheme with our eyes wide open.''</p>
        <p>The backbone of the aid package is an armada of helicopters and more than $500 million for the Colombian Army and police.</p>
        <p>A major difference between the House and Senate bills is the helicopter of choice. The House package includes 30 Blackhawk helicopters, which have longer range and can carry more troops than the 60 Huey choppers that the Senate approved. The Blackhawks cost $12.8 million each, according to administration figures, as opposed to $1.8 million each for the Hueys.</p>
        <p>The Senate version also provides more aid to other Andean countries than the House bill, and for protecting human rights in Colombia.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the aid package framed the debate not only in terms of backing an ally, but also as a crucial step in fighting drugs in the United States. ''The very essence of why we need to help restore stability in Colombia and help combat the violent insurgents is the need to keep drugs off our streets,'' said Senator Mike DeWine, Republican of Ohio.</p>
        <p>Disagreements between House and Senate leaders over how to handle the Colombia aid have delayed final Congressional approval of the package and have strained relations between Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, and Mr. Hastert.</p>
        <p>The House approved the Colombia aid as the centerpiece of a $12.7 billion emergency spending bill that also financed peacekeeping in Kosovo and disaster relief to farmers in North Carolina. But Mr. Lott decided to roll the Colombia package into regular appropriations.</p>
