        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign plans to begin broadcasting these two new 30-second advertisements downstate tonight.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- DeVito/Verdi, along with Mandy Grunwald, the media consultant, and Mark Penn, the pollster.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Both advertisements feature Edward I. Koch, talking into the camera, sitting in a booklined office.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''I like Rick Lazio, but I am not voting for him. He's wrong on too many issues. He opposes licensing and registration of handguns, which I support and Hillary supports. He's not really pro-choice because he won't support funding abortion for poor women, which I support and Hillary supports. And he was willing to run on the Independence line with Pat Buchanan, which I could never agree with. Hillary had the guts to say no way to Buchanan. She's my choice. Trust me. I love New York.''  The second version of the commercial drops the line on Mr. Buchanan, and adds: ''And he's not really for the patients' bill of rights, because he voted against the right to sue your H.M.O.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- As Mr. Koch notes, Mr. Lazio opposes Mrs. Clinton's proposal to register new guns and license gun holders. The advertisement does not note that Mr. Lazio has supported two major pieces of gun control legislation, a ban on most types of assault weapons, and the Brady law. The definition of pro-choice is clearly up for grabs these days; as Mr. Koch notes, Mr. Lazio opposes public financing of abortion, though he supports legal abortion. Mr. Koch does not mention that Mr. Lazio, unlike Mrs. Clinton, opposes the kind of procedure that abortion opponents call partial birth abortion; presumably, Mr. Koch did not draw that contrast because he agreed with Mr. Lazio. Mr. Lazio also sought, unsuccessfully, to run as the Independence Party's Senate candidate; unlike Mrs. Clinton, he said he was willing to run if the party backed Mr. Buchanan for president. The advertisement's portrayal of Mr. Lazio's position on regulation of health maintenance organizations is imprecise: he says he supports legislation that allows patients to sue H.M.O.'s, albeit it under far more limited circumstances than allowed by the Democratic bill he voted against.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mr. Koch is making an early appearance in this campaign -- and this time, the former Democratic mayor is actually appearing on behalf of a Democratic candidate for Senate. (He made a commercial in 1998 on behalf of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican). The use of this durable symbol of New York City, and his farewell line -- ''I love New York'' -- is intended to address concerns about Mrs. Clinton's attempt to run for office in a state where she had not previously lived. Beyond that, it is a fairly standard-issue attack ad, with a popular and smiling surrogate taking care of the attacks. This is the first time Mrs. Clinton has raised Mr. Lazio's willingness to run on a party line with Mr. Buchanan. The rest of the issues are part of what has been a concerted effort by her to portray her rival as conservative.</p>
