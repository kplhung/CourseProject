        <p>Letter by Anne Whitehouse responds to June 8 article on library computerization; says people who avoid libraries and do their research by computer deprive themselves of true treasures of libraries</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article about digital libraries says that Carrie Larkworthy, a Harvard student, hates the library and tries to avoid it. During her four years at Harvard, Ms. Larkworthy may be able to write all her papers without ever leaving her dormitory room or venturing into the stacks of Harvard's great libraries. By avoiding these libraries, she will also be depriving herself of Harvard's true treasures.</p>
        <p>How well I recall a fortuitous discovery that was one of the the highlights of my own four years at Harvard in the dark ages before personal computers, e-mail and the Internet. Browsing in the stacks of Widener Library during the fall of my freshman year, in 1972, I discovered quite by chance an 1810 first edition of stories for children by Mary Wollstonecraft, with woodblock illustrations by William Blake. How astounded I was to discover this book. I could hardly believe it. I checked it out and showed it to my freshman seminar instructor. She was as amazed as I was. We decided that this book really belonged at Houghton Library (the rare book library), rather than Widener, so we took it over there. Needless to say, the staff there were delighted with the find.</p>

        <p>I also remember the thrill of doing research in Houghton Library and holding in my hands the actual newspapers of a rather obscure 1790's association of French Revolution sympathizers, the London Corresponding Society. That Harvard would have collected these papers and that I, as a mere freshman, would have access to them -- to me, this was what scholarship was all about.</p>
