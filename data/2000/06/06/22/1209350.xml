        <p>The day before a scheduled execution in Texas that has come under intense scrutiny, Gov. George W. Bush said he understood and sympathized with the strong emotions of people who opposed the death penalty, calling it ''a subject that needs to be debated in America.''</p>
        <p>But the Texas governor said his support for the death penalty was firm, and would remain so, even if he sensed it was hurting him politically. And he said that if the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles did not vote on Thursday to halt the execution of Gary Graham, convicted of a 1981 murder largely on the testimony of one witness, there was nothing he could do to spare the man.</p>
        <p>''I understand it's a high-profile case, and I know there is a lot of emotion swirling around this case,'' Mr. Bush told reporters this morning in Los Angeles, where he wrapped up a campaign swing through Western states before returning to Texas early this evening. ''The death penalty is not an easy subject for a lot of folks.''</p>
        <p>But, he said, it was part of Texas law, and it was his duty as governor, ''to uphold the laws of the land,'' a phrase he used several times. ''If it costs me politically,'' Mr. Bush said, ''it costs me politically.''</p>
        <p>There is little reason to believe it will -- or has -- and it is possible that the opposite is true. But Mr. Bush nonetheless seemed to be selecting his words and controlling his expression today with care. Gone was his usual buoyancy; in its place was a subdued manner and whispery voice that alternately suggested seriousness and weariness with the questions about the death penalty.</p>
        <p>As both the likely Republican presidential nominee and the governor of a state that executes more inmates than any other, Mr. Bush has become a lightning rod for protests against capital punishment and a focal point in the intensifying national re-examination of whether people sentenced to die have received fair trials.</p>
        <p>Several times over the last three days, demonstrators implored Mr. Bush to stop the execution of Mr. Graham.</p>
        <p>In response to reporters' questions at a news conference today, Mr. Bush struck a more ruminative note than he often had when discussing the death penalty publicly. He said he did not think that news organizations were paying too much attention to executions in Texas.</p>
        <p>''The death penalty is a subject that needs to be debated in America, and cases come along that spark the debate, '' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>He expressed respect for people's rights to make their disapproval of the death penalty known, but said that he, too, had strong convictions.</p>
        <p>''I also keep in mind the victims,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And the reason I support the death penalty is I believe it saves lives. That's why I support it. It so happens the people of my state support it as well.''</p>
        <p>Under Texas law, the governor can accept or reject recommendations from the Board of Pardons and Paroles that a death sentence be commuted or that the inmate be pardoned. But, typically, the governor's only independent authority, if the board authorizes an execution, is to grant the inmate a one-time reprieve of 30 days, which can wind up being much longer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham received such a reprieve from Gov. Ann Richards in 1993, and Mr. Bush said today that his interpretation of the law was that he could not grant Mr. Graham another one. He said he would be in a position to make a decision about Mr. Graham's fate only if the board voted to halt the execution. The board's vote is expected on Thursday several hours before Mr. Graham is slated to be put to death.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he was talking daily with the state's lawyers about Mr. Graham's case and was doing what he always did: assessing whether there was convincing evidence of Mr. Graham's guilt and whether Mr. Graham had full access to courts.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to treat this no differently than any other case that has crossed my desk,'' he said.</p>
