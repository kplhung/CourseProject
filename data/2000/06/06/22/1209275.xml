        <p>THE last time I was waiting for my luggage at the airport, I saw a cracked leather valise stuffed so full that it might have actually encased a live pig. The frenzied way someone had wrapped twine around the bulging case suggested a disturbing record of attempted escapes.</p>
        <p>But then, as the valise traveled around the baggage carousel, I changed my mind. It must have contained something more valuable: otherwise why bother with those additional strips of electrical tape across the locks? After all the other suitcases had been claimed, I decided that it must have belonged to a smuggler apprehended at the gate before he could reclaim his uncut diamonds. Or ivory tusks. Or unpasteurized French cheese.</p>

        <p>THE last time I was waiting for my luggage at the airport, I saw a cracked leather valise stuffed so full that it might have actually encased a live pig. The frenzied way someone had wrapped twine around the bulging case suggested a disturbing record of attempted escapes.</p>
        <p>But then, as the valise traveled around the baggage carousel, I changed my mind. It must have contained something more valuable: otherwise why bother with those additional strips of electrical tape across the locks? After all the other suitcases had been claimed, I decided that it must have belonged to a smuggler apprehended at the gate before he could reclaim his uncut diamonds. Or ivory tusks. Or unpasteurized French cheese.</p>
        <p>I am fascinated by the mystery of other people's luggage, especially their unclaimed luggage. The glamour tends to fade if the owner shows up and turns out to be the same man who sat a row ahead in economy and begged the flight attendant for extra salted nuts. But luggage that is never reunited with its owner always contains the thrill of the unknown.</p>
        <p>So when I learned last week about an online shopping site called Unclaimedbaggage.com, where you can actually buy the contents of unclaimed suitcases, there was no way I could resist. This was something far more tantalizing than the usual discards at a garage sale or thrift store. Here was a rare legal opportunity to riffle through personal items that still had value to their owners at the time they were separated by chance.</p>
        <p>''It's like an archaeological dig in the sense that you see a cross-section of the culture when you open up suitcases: the kinds of clothes people are wearing, the books they're reading, the keepsakes they bought on vacation,'' said Bryan Owens, the owner of the Unclaimed Baggage Center, which operates both the Web site (www.unclaimedbaggage.com) and a block-long retail store in the Appalachian foothills of Scottsboro, Ala. 'We've been doing this for 30 years, and we have long-term, exclusive contracts with many of the major carriers. It's anything you could imagine, although certain things we don't sell. We have an agreement with the F.D.A. to destroy prescription drugs, for instance.''</p>
        <p>Recovering from my disappointment over the prescription drugs, I went to the site's Click on the Suitcase feature to learn about some of the more unusual items that Unclaimed Baggage has collected over the years. The list included two that had once concealed rolls of money: a Barbie doll (luckily the buyer's daughter pulled off the head by accident, revealing $500 inside the torso) and a ''perfectly ordinary soap on a rope'' that had been hollowed out.</p>
        <p>I was ready to buy. Judging from the home page, which announced  ''lost treasures from around the world,'' Mr. Owens is familiar with the psychology of shoppers like me. The site asked: ''What do you imagine a wealthy retired couple might have packed to go to Hawaii? An expensive camera?'' What would the finely tailored corporate executive flying back from Moscow have had in his suitcases? An elegant cashmere top coat? Gold cuff links?''</p>
        <p>Yes, yes, I thought. That's exactly what I would expect! Forgetting for the moment that most suitcases are more likely to harbor items that fall into less savory categories -- like hair care, underwear and tweezers -- I eagerly clicked on Let's Shop. I  arrived at 40 categories of merchandise, from Cigars to Jewelry to Women's Closet, in which a total of 344 different items were offered.</p>
        <p>Somebody's used cigars? That brought me up short for the same reasons that are causing goose bumps on your arms right now.</p>
        <p>But when I examined the nine items for sale in that category, they didn't look used at all. In fact, they were all new: an unopened five-pack of Muriel Air Tip regulars for $1, a new portable pouch called the Humi to keep cigars fresh for $3, a package of pipe filters for $1.</p>
        <p>When I asked Mr. Owens, he acknowledged that most of the items online were new and in fact came from unclaimed shipments of cargo,  things like unworn bedroom slippers, brand-new baby bottles and unused film that had been lost in transit. Nothing from that finely tailored corporate executive after all, no suits in the women's closet section and certainly no used Barbies or rope soaps.</p>
        <p>Mr. Owens said he thought that it would be unfair to sell online shoppers many used items because it was  difficult to examine them closely enough online to determine if they met standards of cleanliness. The FAQ section on the site did pose the pertinent question ''Is it clean?'' (Answer: the store launders or dry-cleans all applicable articles of clothing.) So while the Internet site does sell some mysteries -- like the 40.95-carat emerald offered for $14,750, which would easily enable you to meet the $25 minimum for Internet purchases -- most of the online offerings betrayed no hint of their owner's personality.</p>
        <p>In the end, I decided that the online site was not really a place to shop, but more like one of those mystery bags with a question mark stamped on it that you used to get from a vending machine after you paid 50 cents to take a chance on finding treasure. It was a lot of fun, though, to click on the Peek in the Bag feature and see the receipt from a recent purchase: ''Kenneth Cole women's shoes $59.40, novelty birthday candles $1, lefty scissors three at 25 cents each.''</p>
        <p>No pigs, though.</p>
