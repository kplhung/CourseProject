        <p>A Free Spirit Brought to Earth</p>
        <p>Last night was opening night for the New 42nd Street Studios, a 10-story, 84,000-square-foot building with glass-walled rehearsal space for actors, dancers and musicians.</p>
        <p>ANNE MILITELLO, a Los Angeles lighting designer hired to coordinate an inaugural performance that had dancers performing on exterior catwalks, learned her way around the new building. Perhaps too well.</p>
        <p>On Saturday night, ''I was up on the top of the building on one of the catwalks to demonstrate how it might look up there'' she said. ''I had to wave my jacket around because the dancers were going to be holding these long flags. I took my jacket off and flung it around.''</p>
        <p>The choreographer DAVID PARSONS was on the street, watching. So was a crowd of pedestrians.</p>
        <p>''I guess they thought I was stripping,'' she said. ''I was hearing people yelling 'Don't jump,' but I thought they were kidding.''</p>
        <p>Soon two plainclothes officers arrived.</p>
        <p>''I was told on my walkie-talkie to come down,'' she said. ''I still thought it's a joke. My assistant got on and said, 'No, really, you've got to come down.' ''</p>
        <p>Even on the ground, she still thought the officers were joking. ''I thought they were construction guys saying, 'What do you mean, you were trying to do a dance up there?' ''</p>
        <p>Laying Claim To Musical Profits</p>
        <p>OZZY OSBOURNE's onetime bass player and drummer say they wrote some of his songs in the 1980's and should be paid some of his royalties -- by their estimate, they are owed about $20 million.</p>
        <p>They also say their headaches began not with Mr. Osbourne, but with his wife, SHARON OSBOURNE, who is also his manager.</p>
        <p>The bass player, BOB DAISLEY, and the drummer, LEE KERSLAKE, are suing Mr. Osbourne in federal court in Los Angeles, arguing that they wrote the music and lyrics for two of Mr. Osbourne's early albums, ''Blizzard of Ozz'' and ''Diary of a Madman.'' They say they were not properly paid for their work on the words and music.</p>
        <p>''Ozzy Osbourne never wrote any of the songs for which he is most famous,'' said THOMAS A. BRACKEY II, a lawyer for Mr. Daisley and Mr. Kerslake. ''Osbourne is taking credit for Kerslake and Daisley's work.'' (Mr. Osbourne's lawyers do not dispute that Mr. Daisley and Mr. Kerslake contributed to the songs, but say they were paid when the albums were released.)</p>
        <p>ROGER NEAL, a spokesman for Mr. Daisley and Mr. Kerslake, linked the two musicians' money problems to Mrs. Osbourne.</p>
        <p>''There was a major dislike for Sharon,'' he said. ''After the tours, all this money was rolling in and they were saying, 'When will we get what we were promised?' They never did. She said, 'If you sue me, I'll end your career.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Neal said they had waited to go to court until ''they finally reached a point in their careers where she couldn't hurt them.''</p>
        <p>One of the Osbournes' lawyers, ORIN SNYDER, called the case ''preposterous.'' As for what he called the ''Sharon-the-monster claim,'' he said,  ''Sharon Osbourne doesn't wield that kind of power and would never make those kinds of threats.''</p>
        <p>Another Book On a Murder Case</p>
        <p>SANTE and KENNETH KIMES are scheduled to be sentenced next week for the murder of IRENE SILVERMAN, whose Upper East Side town house they coveted, according to prosecutors. End of story? Not for JEANNE KING, a reporter for Reuters who covers Criminal Court in Manhattan. She has signed six-figure deals for a book and a made-for-television movie about the case.</p>
        <p>Ms. King's book will not be the first about the Kimes case; one was published several months after Mrs. Silverman disappeared in July 1998. But Ms. King insists her book will not be a ''quickie paperback.''</p>
        <p>''She wanted to do the entire story, A to Z, when the case had been adjudicated,'' said her agent, MARIANNE STRONG. Ms. King said her book would have a preface by INSPECTOR JOSEPH REZNICK, who headed the police investigation.</p>
