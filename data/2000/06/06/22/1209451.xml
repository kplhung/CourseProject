        <p>Engel, a five-time American Grand Prix Association rider of the year, and the 11-year-old German-bred gelding were timed in 85.62 seconds. They carry a score of zero penalties into tomorrow's second and third rounds.</p>

        <p>Margie Engle of Wellington, Fla., and the Hidden Creek Farm's Hidden Creek's Perin jumped the only clean round in the time allowed yesterday to take the lead as the United States equestrian team opened trials in Gladstone, N.J., to select four horses and riders for the Sydney Olympic Games in September.</p>
        <p>Engel, a five-time American Grand Prix Association rider of the year, and the 11-year-old German-bred gelding were timed in 85.62 seconds. They carry a score of zero penalties into tomorrow's second and third rounds.</p>
        <p>The survivors from the field of 75 will compete Sunday with two additional rides. Horses and riders with the 12 lowest scores will receive prizes ranging from $2,000 to $30,000 and will move on to San Juan Capistrano, Calif., next month for the final five jumping events to determine spots on the Olympic roster.</p>
        <p>Raymond Texel of Beverly Hills, Calif., piloted Pershing, a 9-year-old Westphalian-bred mare, to a clear round over the 14 obstacles requiring 17 jumping efforts. They were charged with a quarter of a fault for exceeding the 87-second time allowed by 19-hundredths of a second.</p>
