        <p>Gazprom, Russia's biggest company, began a campaign of pressure today against the owner of the nation's largest independent media conglomerate, demanding that his company repay a large debt.</p>
        <p>The move came a week after Vladimir A. Gusinsky, the media tycoon, was jailed on charges of embezzlement. He was released pending trial.  But he has expressed concern to associates that he will face more pressure, and President Vladimir V. Putin has called on Gazprom, a financial supporter, to take a tough stand toward Mr. Gusinsky's company.</p>
        <p>Today, Gazprom, the world's largest natural gas company, seemed to confirm Mr. Gusinsky's fears. It said it would insist that his company, Media-Most, make good on a large loan that Gazprom guaranteed, which would subject Mr. Gusinsky's company to serious economic pressure.</p>
        <p>The loan, of $211 million from Credit Suisse First Boston, was payable in March. Mr. Gusinsky put up 20 percent of his company as collateral, and Gazprom paid the loan and now insists that he settle the debt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky was freed from jail after complaints from Russian businessmen, politicians and journalists. Now the government, which is Gazprom's main shareholder, appears to be looking for his weak spot.</p>
        <p>''We want the money first and foremost,'' said Alfred Kokh, general director of Gazprom Media, a subsidiary that manages the company's media assets. ''We haven't taken the collateral yet, and we aren't sure that we want it.''</p>
        <p>This is not the first time that Gazprom has tried to pressure Mr. Gusinsky. Earlier this year, Gazprom's chief executive, Rem Vyakhirev, called for Media-Most's to take a more pro-government stance in covering the war in Chechnya, saying the critical coverage gave Gazprom serious reason to reconsider extending financial support.</p>
        <p>The government has indicated that Gazprom should halt financial support to Media-Most. Mr. Putin, on an official visit to Europe last week, wondered aloud why Gazprom ''should spend money on this.''</p>
        <p>More recently, Sergei Dubinin, deputy chairman of Gazprom, indicated the company should get out of side businesses like media.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky's company has vulnerabilities. Media-Most is heavily in debt to Gazprom, which now holds 14 percent of the company. But because it paid the past loan, and is liable for a future loan, Gazprom stands to own 54 percent -- a majority -- of Media-Most stock, according to Mr. Kokh of Gazprom Media. Media-Most says the figure is less than 50 percent.</p>
        <p>Media-Most is looking for a foreign investor who could help ease the pressure from Gazprom. Media-Most's main television network, NTV, holds about a third of Russia's television advertising market, which totaled about $150 million last year. Still, the company ran into a cash crunch after the 1998 financial crisis.</p>
        <p>Media-Most says it is worth $2 billion. Gazprom says the amount is far less. ''This is a big fight over the valuation of his companies and what he's prepared to give up,'' one market insider said of Mr. Gusinsky. ''If his valuation is really that high, then why doesn't he just extinguish the loan?''</p>
        <p>In all, Gazprom has guaranteed about $400 million in loans to Mr. Gusinsky's company. The next loan matures in a year.</p>
        <p>In a live television broadcast on Tuesday, Mr. Gusinsky said his company is not in danger of losing assets.</p>
