        <p>Not only were the boxers heavyweights in the 1938 match between Joe Louis and Max Schmeling. So was the symbolism. Black versus white. Freedom versus Fascism. Good versus evil.</p>
        <p>Aiming to capitalize on the propaganda while commenting on it, a new ''Biography'' on A&amp;E tonight has been titled ''Joe Louis: The Boxer Who Beat Hitler.'' (Would that it had been so.)</p>
        <p>Louis's son points out the irony in his father's representing the free world when at home he was denied equality. We hear that Schmeling -- who was pelted with banana peels and paper cups at Yankee Stadium -- was miscast as an evil Nazi. He wasn't a member of the National Socialist Party and had been criticized at home for having a Jewish manager.</p>
        <p>With its potent mix of racial politics, history and celebrity -- not to mention the thrill of boxing -- the Joe Louis story makes an ideal candidate for the long-running ''Biography'' series. (This month A&amp;E is presenting 27 premieres on the series, including the sublime, Mary Magdalene, and the ridiculous, Hulk Hogan.)</p>
        <p>Because of their straightforward and predictable format, the A&amp;E biographies work best when good film is available (not likely with, say, the forthcoming presentation on Peter the Great). The Joe Louis film is very good. There's an eerie beauty in old black-and-white boxing clips, which seem balletic rather than bloody. No ''Raging Bull'' viscera here.</p>
        <p>In the ''Biography'' style (that is, an absence of style), the Joe Louis story unfolds as an allegory, resonant with overt and hidden meaning. ''In an era of prejudice and segregation Louis was uniquely popular,'' we are told. Then, ominously, ''There was an unexpected price to pay for being the torchbearer.''</p>
        <p>In this case allegory seems appropriate. Louis was an iconic figure, as important symbolically in his day as Muhammad Ali would be a generation later. Louis's life moved in a Hollywood arc, beginning poignantly in a sharecropper's cabin in Alabama and ending poignantly with a celebrity-packed funeral at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>Because of the times, and his personality and ambition, he was designated the good Negro, the opposite of Jack Johnson, the black boxer who terrified whites with his belligerence and open affairs with white women. (Johnson's story was told, with perhaps more noise than enlightenment, in the 1970 movie ''The Great White Hope,'' based on the Broadway play.) Louis presented himself as a clean-living, modest man and made sure he was never photographed next to a white woman. (He kept his extramarital arrangements quiet.)</p>
        <p>Still, he wasn't allowed to forget his place. In Pompton Lakes, N.J., where he trained, he became a celebrity. Feeling warmly toward the locals, he bought the town an ambulance with proceeds from a fight but then was denied the opportunity to buy the handsome house he wanted because he was black. Newspapers referred to him racially, as the Dark Destroyer, the Sable Cyclone, the Brown Bomber.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, comments his son, ''he was the only black man who could legitimately beat up a white man and get away with it.''</p>
        <p>Without Hitler and Mussolini, Louis may have been just another heavyweight champ. But his boxing ascent coincided with Fascism's rise, and his fate was sealed. His 1935 defeat of the Italian boxer Primo Carnera was Round 1 in the propaganda fight.</p>
        <p>But Schmeling was a shrewd fighter. When he faced Louis in 1936, he had studied his opponent and knew his weak spot: a tendency to drop his left hand after throwing a punch, leaving himself open. Schmeling knocked him out. Next time, however, Louis was better prepared. In their 1938 rematch, which would prove to be Louis's apotheosis, Schmeling was hit so hard he wept.</p>
        <p>When World War II began, Louis became an icon for black recruitment, helping to urge prospective soldiers to overcome their doubts about serving in the white man's army. He was instrumental in helping desegregate that Army, not only by encouraging enlistment but by using his influence to combat racial bias on military bases.</p>
        <p>Like many veterans, but for different reasons, he came home to find his glory days diminished, even though he was still young. He retired from boxing in 1949, then returned two years later to try to pay off his enormous tax debt.</p>
        <p>His denouement was long and sad. He took up drinking and drugs and began hearing voices coming out of air-conditioning units. Muhammad Ali, representing a new era, refused military service and otherwise rejected Louis's values, calling him an Uncle Tom. But in the end Ali came to Louis's funeral to pay his respect. Respect was due.</p>
