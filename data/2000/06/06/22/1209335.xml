        <p>A Thai businesswoman at the center of the investigation into how the Democratic Party raised money from Asians in 1996 agreed today to plead guilty to funneling $690,000 in illegal donations to the party.</p>
        <p>The businesswoman, Pauline Kanchanalak, will enter guilty pleas to two felony counts. Her sister-in-law, Duangnet Kronenberg, who assisted her in the scheme, has agreed to plead guilty to one felony count, the Justice Department said.</p>
        <p>The department said in a statement that Ms. Kanchanalak made the illegal donations to gain access for herself and Thai business executives to President Clinton and administration officials. Public records showed that Ms. Kanchanalak attended at least 26 White House events after Mr. Clinton's election in 1992. Mr. Clinton was present at 10 of those events, and Vice President Al Gore attended 2. On three other occasions, Ms. Kanchanalak met with officials of the National Security Council, the White House agency that coordinates foreign policy.</p>
        <p>The donations were illegal because Ms. Kanchanalak falsely identified the donors, most of whom were foreigners and were thus prohibited from making campaign contributions.</p>
        <p>More than $457,000 of the donations were provided to the Democratic National Committee and five state Democratic Party committees in connection with a ''coffee'' session at the White House on June 18, Justice Department officials said.</p>
        <p>At that event, Ms. Kanchanalak and four Thai business associates discussed United States-China policy with Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>One of those in attendance at the meeting was a client of Ms. Kanchanalak's, Dhanin Chearvanont, a major Thai industrialist whose company is considered the largest single foreign investor in China.</p>
        <p>Today, Ms. Kanchanalak's lawyer said that she had decided to plead guilty because of what he said was a ''lengthy and aggressive government prosecution that has completely consumed her life.''</p>
        <p>The lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, said prosecutors had threatened to bring charges of international money laundering against Ms. Kanchanalak if she did not plead guilty to some of the fund-raising charges. Ms. Kanchanalak and Ms. Kronenberg both agreed to cooperate with the investigation by the Justice Department's campaign financing task force.</p>
