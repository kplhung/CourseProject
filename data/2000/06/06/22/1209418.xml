        <p>The House Ways and Means Committee approved legislation tonight to offer prescription drug benefits to all 39 million people on Medicare, and Republican leaders said they hoped the full House would vote on the bill within 10 days.</p>
        <p>The committee endorsed the legislation by a party-line vote of 23 to 14, with Republicans supporting the measure and Democrats opposed.</p>
        <p>Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the committee, said, ''Now is the time to add prescription drug coverage to Medicare -- right from the start, our bill will give 5.5 million low-income seniors a prescription drug plan at minimal cost.''</p>
        <p>But Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, said the measure was ''basically a hoax, a prescription for failure,'' because it did not guarantee that elderly people would actually get drug benefits at an affordable price.</p>
        <p>Under the bill, drafted by Republicans, the government would pay subsidies to private insurance companies to encourage them to offer insurance policies covering drug costs of the elderly. But the government itself would not directly provide drug coverage, nor would it purchase drugs or regulate drug prices.</p>
        <p>Earlier tonight, by a vote of 22 to 12, the committee rejected a proposal by Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, that would have authorized the federal government to offer a standard package of drug benefits throughout the United States.</p>
        <p>''There is no guarantee of any particular benefit that our constituents will get if the Republican bill is enacted,'' Mr. Cardin said. ''The Republicans say this would be an entitlement program, but there is no specific benefit that seniors are entitled to.''</p>
        <p>Medicare finances health care for people who are elderly or disabled, but generally does not cover drugs for people outside the hospital. One-third of the elderly have no insurance to cover drug costs.</p>
        <p>Under the House Republican bill, the details of drug insurance -- benefits, premiums, co-payments and deductibles -- could vary from one private insurer to another, so long as the total value was equivalent to that of a standard policy defined by the government.</p>
        <p>The debate over Mr. Cardin's proposal encapsulated the differences between the two parties. Representative Jim McCrery, Republican of Louisiana, argued against the Cardin proposal, saying: ''We don't want the government to control health care. It has not done a particularly good job.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, Republicans said it was unnecessary for the government itself to provide drug benefits because private insurers would do the job with federal subsidies.</p>
        <p>Merck-Medco Managed Care, a unit of Merck &amp; Company, the worldwide drug manufacturer based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., said today that it wanted to offer drug coverage under the House Republican bill.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Congress, Per G. H. Lofberg, chairman of Merck-Medco, said, ''We would work to develop a prescription drug-only plan that we could offer nationwide in competition with others in what we expect will be a highly competitive amrket.''</p>
        <p>However, Mr. Cardin said, ''I don't know whether my constituents in Maryland will have this Merck plan available to them five years from now.'' Mr. Cardin said he feared that insurers would move in and out of the market for drug benefits, just as health maintenance organizations have moved in and out of Medicare.</p>
        <p>House Republican leaders said they hoped the full House would pass their Medicare bill by the end of next week, when lawmakers leave town for Independence Day.</p>
        <p>Richard J. Tarplin, an assistant secretary of health and human services who attended today's session of the Ways and Means Committee, said, ''We strongly oppose this bill.'' On the House floor, Democrats will have an opportunity to offer a proposal of their own as an alternative.</p>
        <p>Regardless of whether a Medicare drug bill becomes law this year -- and no one can be sure -- House Republicans said they hoped that, by taking up the legislation, they could inoculate themselves against attacks by Democrats exploiting one of the most potent political issues in this fall's elections.</p>
        <p>The Republican bill says that all Medicare beneficiaries would have a choice of two or more private drug plans. If insurers did not voluntarily enter a particular market, the government could offer financial incentives to draw them in.</p>
        <p>But a critique of the House Republican bill, prepared by the Clinton administration, said: ''Insurers are unlikely to participate unless bribed. The new Medicare bureaucracy could increase payments to insurers to bribe them to participate. This will make insurers hold out to get higher payments.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, the administration said, the Republican proposal ''relies on a flawed trickle-down theory that would end up subsidizing insurers, not seniors.''</p>
        <p>The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Republican bill would cost $39.7 billion over the next five years and $158 billion from 2001 to 2010. Republicans said that beneficiaries would pay premiums averaging $37 a month, or $444 a year, for drug coverage under their proposal.</p>
        <p>In the Senate, Republican leaders have not shown any sense of urgency, though they acknowledge that millions of low-income Medicare beneficiaries cannot afford the drugs they need. The chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, a Republican in a tight re-election race, has said he wants the panel to vote next month on comprehensive Medicare legislation, including drug benefits.</p>
        <p>But Senate Republican leaders are wary, fearing that the cost of drug benefits could explode.</p>
        <p>The House Republican bill defines a model drug insurance policy, known as ''standard coverage.'' Under this policy, a Medicare beneficiary would pay an annual deductible of $250 and would pay half of the next $2,100 a year in drug costs. Most patients would then be responsible for their own drug expenses, but the beneficiary's out-of-pocket costs would be limited to $6,000 a year.</p>
        <p>In theory, each insurer would negotiate with drug companies to obtain drug price discounts comparable to those now secured by large purchasers like hospitals and H.M.O.'s. Medicare patients would get these discounts regardless of whether they had reached the limits of their drug insurance benefits.</p>
        <p>The Ways and Means Committee voted, 23 to 14, to reject a Democratic alternative very similar to a plan offered by President Clinton. Democrats said their proposals would have cost $100 billion over five years, or 2.5 times as much as the Republican bill. Democrats said that a large increase in anticipated federal budget surpluses permitted more generous drug benefits.</p>
        <p>Today's debate focused on the proper role of government. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, said: ''Democrats are for an affordable, guaranteed benefit under the Medicare program. Republicans want to basically privatize this benefit, as they've always wanted to privatize Medicare.''</p>
        <p>Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said: ''The Republicans have no confidence in providing assistance directly to our aged. Rather, they want to subsidize the private sector, the H.M.O.'s, the insurance companies.''</p>
        <p>Republicans said they would offer what the elderly want: more choices.</p>
        <p>Tillie Fowler of Florida, vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, said: ''Unlike the Clinton-Gore plan, we give all seniors and the disabled the right to choose an affordable prescription drug benefit that fits their needs. Americans can choose a Cadillac plan, or they can opt for a more affordable Honda plan.''</p>
