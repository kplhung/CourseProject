        <p>''Appalachia Waltz,'' the lively ballet that Miriam Mahdaviani has choreographed as the final entry in the New York City Ballet's Diamond Project, is not your usual stage hoedown. The title comes from a recording in which Yo-Yo Ma, Edgar Meyer and Mark O'Connor, classically trained musicians, explored compositions by Mr. Meyer and Mr. O'Connor that had a contemporary approach to American folk music. Ms. Mahdaviani's ballet, which had its premiere on Tuesday night at the New York State Theater, takes what could be called the same crossover approach.</p>
        <p>There was a time when Americana in ballet was embodied in Agnes de Mille's ''Rodeo'' and Eugene Loring's ''Billy the Kid.'' These works of the 1930's and 40's, with square dances for cowboys and cowgirls, were imbued with the nationalist fervor of their time. Rooted in the myth of the open frontier, they paid tribute to its vision of opportunity, a life of nation-building.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mahdaviani's ethos and aesthetics are understandably elsewhere in this era. Americana is redefined here: gone are the pictorial images, although the three musicians from City Ballet's orchestra who are onstage wear suspenders like country fiddlers. So do the six male dancers, and Holly Hynes's costumes dress the women in short, belted tunics. The choreography, anchored in the conceit of a big country dance, absorbs square-dance patterns, often in miniature fast-moving formations. The focus, as always with Ms. Mahdaviani, is on steps.</p>
        <p>''Appalachia Waltz,'' named after one of seven excerpts from the recording, is a strongly neo-classical ballet. Plotless, it abstracts its folk inspiration but also pays homage to it on a formal level. Like her composers, Ms. Mahdaviani respects the folk sources but treats them with sophistication.</p>
        <p>And like all her works, this one is admirable in its craftsmanship, but it is less dry. Nonetheless, the ballet loses its quality of surprise once the delight of the initial image wears off. Albert Evans and Jennie Somogyi and the more lyrical duo of Nilas Martins and Jenifer Ringer are the lead couples, although four other pairs in the ensemble have as much to do. It is how they are artfully moved in and out of dissolving patterns that gives the choreography much of its interest.</p>
        <p>Paul Peabody, violin; Fred Zlotkin, cello; and Ron Wasserman, double bass, are the fine musicians onstage, counterparts, respectively, to Mr. O'Connor, a well-known specialist in the Texas style of country fiddling, Mr. Ma and Mr. Meyer, whose jazz-influenced music has been used memorably by Twyla Tharp (''Octet'').</p>
        <p>Mr. Meyer and Mr. O'Connor, sometimes arranging old tunes of Scotch-Irish provenance, have also written original music. Mr. Meyer's jazzy dips and slides are matched in a loose-hipped solo for Mr. Evans as a ladies' man in a straw hat.</p>
        <p>Mark Stanley's backdrop depicts leafless trees and his lighting, never literal (the sky turns lavender), speaks poetically of the passing of time.</p>
        <p>Two traditional tunes, ''The Green Groves of Erin'' and ''The Flowers of Red Hill,'' introduce the ensemble frozen in small groups as the curtain rises. The original version of George Balanchine's 1957 ''Square Dance'' also had a small string ensemble onstage, making the connection between Baroque music and folk dancing.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mahdaviani works in the same spirit, although she has three men mime working in the fields and wiping the sweat from their brows before two circles of men and women lead into a square pattern with Ms. Somogyi and Mr. Adams bringing the choreography's motifs to the fore. These include pirouettes, high kicks and much leg flicking.</p>
        <p>Ms. Somogyi, always her dynamic self, is turned upside down and slides between her partner's legs just before Ms. Ringer enters to a dominant violin sound. Mr. O'Connor's ''Old Country Fairy Tale'' accompanies her duet with Mr. Martins, which is filled with love images and repeated lifts and cabriolets. An image of a woman slid forward into an arabesque comes out of Balanchine's ''Concerto Barocco.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mahdaviani has never been afraid to borrow from her mentor, and here a familiar image gains in a new context. The music spools out charmingly and the duet has a structural felicity. When one partner executes a cabriolet, the other repeats until the two do it together: well danced. Mr. Meyer's ''Pickles'' and ''Schizoozzy'' lead into a solo for Mr. Evans. Resilient and stretched in every movement, he skips and woos Rachel Rutherford, Samantha Allen, Eva Natanya and Aesha Ash in brief duets. Ms. Somogyi charges in to reclaim him as her own.</p>
        <p>''Appalachia Waltz,'' composed by Mr. O'Connor but arranged by Mr. Meyer, has Arch Higgins and Ms. Natanya, Ms. Allen and Jared Angle, and Ms. Ash and Jeroen Hofmans in a series of neoclassical duets. The last, for Ms. Rutherford and James Fayette, incorporates a fleeting dramatic incident. Mr. Fayette falls, and the others help him out. But life goes on to a traditional tune, ''Chief Sitting in the Rain.'' Mr. Martins dances what looks like a bad mazurka, but Ms. Mahdaviani recoups in a stylized square dance for all, an apt finale for an imperfect ballet with some perfect moments.</p>
        <p>The program included Balanchine's ''Donizetti Variations,'' which needs rethinking in its present staging. Philip Neal's swagger was out of place and Yvonne Borree's solo was technically inadequate. Mary Helen Bowers and Dana Hanson offered parodies of the City Ballet's style in their clawed-hand gawky silhouettes, and toe work could have been better all around.</p>
        <p>By contrast Peter Martins's ''Fearful Symmetries,'' to John Adams's score, received one of its best performances.</p>
        <p>Alexandre Iziliaev and Adam Hendrickson were outstanding soloists. Dancing with breakneck speed, Ms. Allen was outstanding with a grim if impressive Benjamin Millepied. Kathleen Tracey, Charles Askegard, Maria Kowroski and Mr. Fayette made the entangled lead quartet more interesting than usual. Maurice Kaplow conducted.</p>
        <p>DANCE REVIEW  Correction:  June 23, 2000, Friday  Because of a transmission problem, a dance review yesterday about Miriam Mahdaviani's ''Appalachia Waltz,'' given its premiere on Tuesday as part of the New York City Ballet's Diamond Project at the New York State Theater, referred incorrectly to a leaping movement. It is a cabriole, not a cabriolet.</p>
        <p>The review in one reference also misstated the surname of the dancer partnering Jenny Somogyi in the premiere. As stated elsewhere in the review, he was Albert Evans, not Adams.</p>
