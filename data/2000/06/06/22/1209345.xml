        <p>Protesters took control of the Nike Web site yesterday and redirected visitors to a site urging organizations to gather at and disrupt a world economic summit meeting planned for later this year in Australia.</p>
        <p>Nike, the footwear company, said the action made its site inaccessible for up to 7 hours to some visitors starting at 10 a.m. Eastern time yesterday -- and the company said it was working with law enforcement officials to determine the group responsible for the attack.</p>
        <p>''We don't think it'll be too hard to find out who did it,'' said Corby Casler, a company spokeswoman, adding that it is unclear whether the company or government would be able to take any action in response to the attack. ''Knowing who did it and being able to prove it are two different things.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Casler said that the Web site that was attacked is the main e-commerce site for Nike, but that it was too soon to tell whether the company lost revenue, and, if so, how much.</p>
        <p>Nike, though it has come under attack for its treatment of workers at overseas factories, which critics say are sweatshops, is not the first to have its Web site redirected or defaced by so-called hacktivists. Groups opposing a variety of corporate and government activities have increasingly taken to cyberspace to put their own messages in place of an institution's Web site.</p>
        <p>In this case, the Nike site was redirected to a site of an organization called S11 Alliance, based in Australia. On the site, the group is described as a network of groups and individuals concerned about ''the growth of corporate power and the direction of globalization.'' .</p>
        <p>It is unclear if S11 was involved in the actual redirection. E-mail inquiries sent to S11 were not returned.</p>
        <p>The organization's Web site calls for protesters to use nonviolent means to shut down the World Economic Forum 2000, a gathering of economists, academicians, executives and government officials, to be held on Sept. 11-13 in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
        <p>The site does not specify particular grievances against Nike, except to include it on a list of World Economic Forum participants, along with companies like Exxon Mobil, Honeywell, McDonald's, Phillip-Morris and Amazon.com.</p>
        <p>''Nike is used to dealing with this type of thing,'' Ms. Casler said.</p>
