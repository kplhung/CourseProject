        <p>The portable Super Wash (a nonelectric washing machine) is useful for small apartments, campers or anyone who has small loads of clothes to wash and wants to save water and money and conserve electricity. The seven-quart machine, which is operated by cranking a handle, sits on the edge of a sink and washes up to five pounds of laundry in about two minutes.</p>
        <p>The soapy water drains through a valve into the sink; rinsing involves refilling with clean water and repeating the process. Super Wash is $90 at Terminal-NYC, 28-30 Watts Street (Thompson Street).</p>
