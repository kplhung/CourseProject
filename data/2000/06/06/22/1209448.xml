        <p>A boyhood friend of Michael Skakel's  testified in court today that Mr. Skakel admitted years later that on the night their 15-year-old friend Martha Moxley was murdered in 1975, he was in the tree directly above where her body was found the next morning.</p>
        <p>The friend, Andrew Pugh, said that Mr. Skakel, then also 15, had ''an attraction, an infatuation'' with Miss Moxley. Mr. Pugh lived across the street from the Skakels and around the corner from the Moxleys in an exclusive section of Greenwich.</p>

        <p>A boyhood friend of Michael Skakel's  testified in court today that Mr. Skakel admitted years later that on the night their 15-year-old friend Martha Moxley was murdered in 1975, he was in the tree directly above where her body was found the next morning.</p>
        <p>The friend, Andrew Pugh, said that Mr. Skakel, then also 15, had ''an attraction, an infatuation'' with Miss Moxley. Mr. Pugh lived across the street from the Skakels and around the corner from the Moxleys in an exclusive section of Greenwich.</p>
        <p>He testified today that he believed that Mr. Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, had committed the murder. When he confronted his old friend with that suspicion in a 1991 telephone conversation, he said, Mr. Skakel denied that he had killed her but admitted that he had been in the Moxleys' yard the night she died, masturbating in the tree.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pugh's testimony was similar to the story Mr. Skakel told private investigators hired by his father in 1995. In that account, which differs significantly from his original statement to the police in 1975, Mr. Skakel said that he sneaked out his window about 11:30 p.m. and walked to the Moxley home, where he climbed a tree and tossed pebbles at Miss Moxley's window. When she did not respond, Mr. Skakel said, he masturbated in the tree.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pugh was one of the two final witnesses called by prosecutors today in their effort to persuade a juvenile court judge to refer the case to Superior Court, putting Mr. Skakel, 39, on trial as an adult. He is now charged in the case as a juvenile. If convicted as an adult, he could face 25 years to life in prison.</p>
        <p>The prosecution's swift completion of its case in this ''reasonable cause'' hearing offered a striking contrast to the investigation of the case, which dragged on for nearly a quarter- century until Mr. Skakel's indictment early this year. The hearing will resume on Wednesday with the  defense witnesses.</p>
        <p>The unusual case against Mr. Skakel, in which an adult is charged with murder as a juvenile, has already broken legal ground. It is the first juvenile court proceeding fully open to the media and the public.</p>
        <p>The prosecution's final witness was Judith Kallen, an official with the State Department of Children and Families. The prosecutor, Jonathan C. Benedict, sought to demonstrate that the Connecticut juvenile justice system has no mechanisms for dealing with a criminal offender over age 18, suggesting that Mr. Skakel must be tried as an adult.</p>
        <p>By law, inmates in juvenile detention must be released at age 18, she testified, adding that state officials now use psychologists and other experts to determine whether a juvenile defendant should be tried as an adult, focusing on the child's chances  of rehabilitation.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, pointed out during cross-examination that this case was like no other. He suggested that the nearly 25-year delay in bringing the case to court had provided state officials ''a crystal ball'' showing all they needed to know about Mr. Skakel's chances of rehabilitation and becoming a productive member of society.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherman asked Ms. Kallen if that was sufficient evidence of potential for rehabilitation. Under a 1975 law, one requirement of transferring a juvenile case to Superior Court is a finding that ''the safety of the community requires that the child continue under restraint for a period extending beyond his majority.'' Ms. Kallen told Mr. Sherman that she did ''not have that kind of expertise,'' adding, ''I have never had to look back at somebody's behavior over a 24-year period.'' Mr. Sherman quickly replied, ''Not until now.''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Sherman presents his case next week, Judge Maureen Dennis will determine whether to transfer the case to Superior Court, to allow a trial to proceed before her in juvenile court without a jury, or to dismiss the matter entirely.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the first day of the pretrial hearing, two former classmates of Mr. Skakel's testified that he confessed to the murder in the late 1970's while at a school for troubled youths in Maine. One of them, Gregory Coleman, completed his testimony this morning. Mr. Coleman, who was convicted of a robbery in the 1980's, was brought from a prison near Rochester, where he is serving a yearlong sentence for criminal trespassing.</p>
        <p>Much of his testimony today came in response to questions from Mr. Sherman about his requests for money and for help from Connecticut officials. Mr. Coleman has received neither for his testimony, though he acknowledged that he had made mistakes in his testimony before a grand jury in the Moxley case in 1998.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Skakel's sister and brothers, who filled a first row in the courtroom, seemed to pay most attention to the testimony of Mr. Pugh, the former family friend. He said that he and Mr. Skakel had drifted apart after the Moxley murder and had little or no contact during the 1980's. But in 1991 they bumped into each other at Christ Church in Greenwich, where Mr. Pugh was attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.</p>
        <p>They discussed resuming their friendship, Mr. Pugh testified, but he said he told Mr. Skakel in a subsequent telephone conversation that it ''could be difficult for me because I had some doubts as to his involvement'' and asked if Mr. Skakel had committed the crime. ''He said 'No,' '' Mr. Pugh testified. ''He told me that he had been on their property, he had been in that tree masturbating, but that he had nothing to do with Miss Moxley's death.''</p>
        <p>Under cross-examination, Mr. Pugh conceded that Mr. Skakel never specified which tree he meant on the Moxley property, but the witness said he believed it to be the tall pine in the Moxley yard that he and Mr. Skakel had climbed frequently as children. Miss Moxley's body was found under it on Oct. 31, 1975, her head bludgeoned with a golf club taken from a set that belonged to Rushton Skakel, Mr. Skakel's father.</p>
        <p>''That conversation kind of, shall I say, addled me slightly,'' Mr. Pugh testified today.</p>
