        <p>Chuck Knoblauch tipped a plastic foam cup forward and allowed the coffee to slowly roll closer to the edge before easing the liquid back to the bottom. He did it again to challenge himself and never spilled one drop. Knoblauch did it because it was a competition. He devised the test so he could compete against himself and he won. You could tell Knoblauch expected to succeed.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch is impossible to overlook these days as the proud Yankee who is trying to overcome a serious throwing problem while standing at second base and being scrutinized by millions of people. Knoblauch tells himself every day that he is strong enough to conquer his woes and then he tells himself to believe it. Sometimes, he does. Sometimes, he wonders.</p>
        <p>He needs to compete and he wants to compete, but Knoblauch is still unsure about being at second base every night. There is still a part of Knoblauch that is anxious. But Knoblauch insisted that this ordeal would make him better as a player and as a person and feels something that might have seemed like a crisis before this experience would no longer bother him.</p>
        <p>''I definitely think this is working on me in a good way, in a roundabout way,'' Knoblauch said. ''I really believe that everything happens for a reason. Where there are valleys, there are peaks sooner or later. This has to make me stronger. It can't make me weaker. It won't make me crumble.''</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre made a shrewd maneuver tonight when he used Knoblauch as a designated hitter for the second time in his Yankees' career and conceded that he might do the same thing as soon as tomorrow when the Chicago White Sox start a left-hander. Torre said he would not have done it if Knoblauch objected, but the 31-year old was amenable, so expect to see Knoblauch at D.H. a couple of times a week until he proves that his throwing problem has vanished. Knoblauch went 1 for 5 with a run batted in and 2 runs scored in a sloppy 9-7 loss last night to the sagging Red Sox.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to mess with somebody's psyche,'' Torre said. ''I told him he will be out there for nine innings. You know it can't be easy with what is going on in the stands. This can be a break for him.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch, who sweated as he furiously pedaled an exercise bike after the game, was candid with reporters about being the D.H. as he continued to discuss his problem in almost therapeutic fashion. Ever since Knoblauch made three terrible throwing errors last Thursday and bolted Yankee Stadium before the game ended, he has been mostly affable and available. After being analyzed and berated by fans when his throws occasionally floated like balloons, Knoblauch has become the rehabilitating second baseman, who showed a public fragility that has made him more human than ever.</p>
        <p>''I'm still in the game,'' Knoblauch said about being a D.H. ''Plus, that will give me a good mental break from playing defense. It's not a secret. We all know what's going on.''</p>
        <p>There had been several instances in the last two seasons when Knoblauch made a throwing error and steadfastly refused to discuss it, but he has been personable and self-deprecating in the last week. When a reporter used the word divorce in a question about playing second base, Knoblauch playfully teased him. When the reporter replaced divorce with separate, Knoblauch teased him more.</p>
        <p>''Got any other legal questions?'' joked Knoblauch, who is divorced.</p>
        <p>Even Torre conceded that Knoblauch has been much more relaxed since the three-error game and speculated that Knoblauch could have been denying that he had a problem. The Yankees acquired utility man Jose Vizcaino from Los Angeles for Jim Leyritz and he will get a lot of playing time as Knoblauch's defensive replacement, but Knoblauch praised the trade that was made because of him. He also dismissed the theory that he has been more open in discussing his plight lately.</p>
        <p>''People want to know,'' Knoblauch said. ''You want to know. It doesn't do a lot of good talking about it, but I guess it does. I'm not trying to hide from anything.''</p>
        <p>One of Knoblauch's friends plays in the Cape Cod League and he visited on Monday. The college player brought a teammate and, as they talked in Knoblauch's hotel room, the teammate laughed nervously and revealed to Knoblauch that he had a similar throwing problem. Knoblauch told him he should not be embarrassed and, for one night, he felt good because he had his awkward experience allowed him to give someone else advice.</p>
        <p>''He felt comfortable talking about it and I could relate,'' Knoblauch said. ''Maybe someone will see me and it'll help them.''</p>
        <p>Once upon a time, there was a gritty second baseman who was an All-Star, who won a Gold Glove Award and who was in the midst of a career that could have gained him consideration for the Hall of Fame. But then he had trouble tossing the ball to first and, even while he was an important part of two World Series Champions, the problem mushroomed. When Knoblauch was asked if he dreams about being that other second baseman again, you could tell he expected to succeed at being that player again. But you could tell he did not know when.</p>
        <p>''That's not possible right now,'' admitted Knoblauch. ''That goes back to having hope and seeing light at the end of the tunnel. When you see that light, this will go away. I don't want to be in this position. I don't want to be the story. Maybe one day it can get back to the way it used to be.''</p>
