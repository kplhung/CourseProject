        <p>HUDSON DRY GOODS  873 Broadway (19th Street)</p>
        <p>A BIG Grandma's attic familiar to Upper West Side shoppers, Hudson Dry Goods has recently opened a new, two-story shop in the Flatiron district. Here you can find merchandise for virtually every room of the house, both old and new, shown off in displays that look like sets from ''The Honeymooners'' or ''I Love Lucy.'' Offerings include new Jadeite dinnerware, below, reminiscent of designs from the 1940's and 50's. It is displayed in an early-20th-century Eastern European hutch, $1,749. A dinner plate costs $12, and a pitcher is $29. The same pieces can be found directly across the street at ABC Carpet &amp; Home, which also carries the line, for $12 and $28. The new stainless-steel diner coffeepots, above, are $39, and teapots are $29; old coffee cans are $14 each.</p>
