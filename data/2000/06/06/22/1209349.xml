        <p>Rod Thorn has been the president of the Nets for less than three weeks, but he has tried to cram in a year's worth of work before next Wednesday's draft. There are daily workouts with players who dream of becoming the top pick -- the Nets' pick. There is the search for a head coach. And there are the many question marks that litter the roster.</p>
        <p>''I prefer it that way,'' Thorn said in a conference call yesterday. ''I like to have a lot of things going on at one time. Certainly at this time of the year you've got a lot of things going on. We have a chance to do good things here in short time; I think it's very exciting what's transpiring.''</p>

        <p>Rod Thorn has been the president of the Nets for less than three weeks, but he has tried to cram in a year's worth of work before next Wednesday's draft. There are daily workouts with players who dream of becoming the top pick -- the Nets' pick. There is the search for a head coach. And there are the many question marks that litter the roster.</p>
        <p>''I prefer it that way,'' Thorn said in a conference call yesterday. ''I like to have a lot of things going on at one time. Certainly at this time of the year you've got a lot of things going on. We have a chance to do good things here in short time; I think it's very exciting what's transpiring.''</p>
        <p>Just what is happening is still uncertain, even to Thorn. The Nets must decide whether to keep the No. 1 pick or to trade it, and if they keep the pick, who to draft.</p>
        <p>The team has two glaring holes, with injuries threatening the season, and careers, of Jayson Williams and Kerry Kittles. But the players who have floated to the top of the draft speculation come with questions.</p>
        <p>Cincinnati forward Kenyon Martin, for example, is recovering from a broken leg and could not work out this week while he was in town interviewing. Texas center Chris Mihm has endured criticism about his mental toughness.</p>
        <p>Thorn said the players the Nets were considering included Martin, Mihm, Stromile Swift, Darius Miles and Marcus Fizer. Interviews will continue through Monday, he said.</p>
        <p>''We're not in a position yet to say who we're going to take if we stay there,'' Thorn said, ''and we're entertaining trade possibilities. We've had some interesting ones. But it's still too early.''</p>
        <p>Thorn said he expected it would take a combination of draft picks and a veteran player to pry the pick loose. He said he believed that the teams with multiple lottery picks, the Orlando Magic and Chicago Bulls, would try to unload some or all of the picks to keep under the salary cap for the free-agent chase.</p>
        <p>While the Nets decide, Thorn is controlling the show. He said that a coach would not likely be named before Wednesday's draft, although he has conducted five interviews. The Nets assistant Eddie Jordan; Lenny Wilkens, who was named yesterday as the coach of the Toronto Raptors; Kentucky Coach Tubby Smith; and the Sacramento Kings assistant Byron Scott are believed to be among the candidates. According to a league official, Jordan turned down the Atlanta Hawks' offer to be the top assistant to Lon Kruger.</p>
        <p>Thorn indicated that he did want a coach in place to help in the free-agency period, which begins July 1, with teams able to speak to players through Aug. 1, when negotiations can begin. Thorn was expected to meet with Martin yesterday.</p>
        <p>''We're going to have our doctors look at him very closely and certainly that will have impact on what we end up doing in draft,'' Thorn said. ''What we see on tape is a terrific quick leap off the floor. He gets up, blocks shots, is able to convert around the basket, get fouled because of the tremendous quickness he has. You're talking about a big, mobile, quick player.''</p>
        <p>Given Williams's career-threatening injuries, Thorn said: ''Martin is a guy we would have to take a close look at. He would give the team some of the things that Jayson was able to do.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>KERRY KITTLES is not expected to be ready for the start of the season, but ROD THORN said: ''The doctors who did the last surgery think it's successful and he will be able to resume playing.''</p>
