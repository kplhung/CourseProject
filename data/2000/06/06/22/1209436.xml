        <p>The third straight day of jury deliberations in the federal tax-fraud case of Albert J. Pirro Jr. ended late this afternoon without a verdict. But for the first time, there was a whiff of discord among the jurors.</p>
        <p>Just a few minutes after deliberations began today at 9 a.m. in Federal District Court, one of the jurors, looking grim and perturbed, met privately with Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr.</p>
        <p>Shortly thereafter, Judge Parker summoned the lawyers and Mr. Pirro to a closed conference. Then he summoned the jury of eight men and four women. He reminded them that it was important that a ''verdict must be unanimous'' and that ''there's no shortcut, no compromising,'' but that it was just as vital to discuss the case in a ''polite, friendly fashion,'' even if one or more jurors were ''outnumbered or outtalked.''</p>
        <p>''Sometimes, tempers flare and things get a little heated,'' Judge Parker said. ''Try not to personalize any differences you may have.''</p>
        <p>None of the principals in the incident would give any details. But given the tenor of Judge Parker's remarks and Mr. Pirro's reaction upon leaving the conference -- a beaming smile -- speculation was rife among people at the courthouse that the angry juror may have been a stubborn lone wolf blocking consensus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pirro, a successful real estate lawyer and Republican lobbyist, and his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro, are accused of improperly deducting $1.2 million in personal expenses as business write-offs.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors have portrayed Albert Pirro as a ''crook'' driven by greed.</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers have said he was often too preoccupied with making deals and doing business to pay close attention to bookkeeping details.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pirro is the husband of Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, who is not charged with any wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>The jury has given little indication of its leanings. And after today's incident, Mr. Pirro, who turned 53 today, was not about to start handicapping his chances.</p>
        <p>''It means they're working hard,'' Mr. Pirro said. ''Whatever the outcome is, I accept it.''</p>
