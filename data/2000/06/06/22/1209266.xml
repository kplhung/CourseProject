        <p>IF you find something you like that's vintage, buy it -- you may never see it again,'' said Paula Rubenstein, whose shop, which specializes in vintage American textiles, features a colorful collection of patterned 1940's and 50's cotton tablecloths, below. The machine washable cloths, perfect for a picnic or a porch table, are mostly 54 inches square, but some are as large as 63 by 82 inches. They are in good condition (without major stains) and cost $45 to $125.</p>
        <p>Stainless-steel flatware with colorful Bakelite handles, from the 1930's through the 1950's, above, are $10 each for knives, forks and spoons, $35 for serving pieces. A rare set of six iced-tea spoons is $135.</p>
