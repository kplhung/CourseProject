        <p>The Yankees continued to press trade negotiations today in their effort to deal for either the Cubs' Sammy Sosa or Detroit's Juan Gonzalez, according to baseball officials -- one who believes that the chances are better than 50-50 that an agreement could be reached soon for Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>The Yankees continued discussions today with both teams, and if they negotiate a deal with either the Cubs or the Tigers, the Yankees will want time to reach a contract agreement with the slugger they acquire before completing the trade.</p>
        <p>Some members of the Yankees believe a deal will be completed shortly, or else the team will back off their pursuit of both players. George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, told a trusted acquaintance at Yankee Stadium on June 15 that he figured a deal would be done in about a week.</p>
        <p>Before tonight's game with the Red Sox, the Yankees got good news regarding Orlando Hernandez. The right-hander was told he had a mild elbow sprain earlier this week by Stuart Hershon, the Yankees' team doctor, and today, Dr. James Andrews agreed with that diagnosis. Hernandez should be able to return to the rotation in a week.</p>
        <p>Jose Vizcaino, the infielder acquired for Jim Leyritz in a deal completed with the Los Angeles Dodgers early Wednesday morning, arrived here about two hours before the game and was available to play.</p>
        <p>Other teams like the Boston Red Sox and the Mets have made overtures for Sosa and Gonzalez, but just as was the case when Roger Clemens became available two years ago, it does not appear as if there is a robust market for the two outfielders who will both command huge salaries in the future.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have money and are willing to spend it. They also have prospects, including a potential shortstop in Alfonso Soriano and a home run hitter in Drew Henson.</p>
        <p>The Yankees may represent the best possible trading partner for the Cubs and the Tigers. If the Yankees trade for Sosa, they will not make a deal for Gonzalez, and vice-versa, and if executives from the Cubs and the Tigers prefer to trade with the Yankees, they will be compelled by the presence of the other to negotiate with alacrity.</p>
        <p>The Cubs and Tigers each possess lists of players the Yankees would be willing to deal, and the lists might be virtually identical, containing pitchers like the Class AA left-hander Randy Kiesler, the Class AA right-hander David Walling (a No. 1 pick in 1999), and outfielder Juan Rivera.  Soriano figures to be in any major deal the Yankees make. He is valuable and, at the same time, expendable, because of the presence of shortstop Derek Jeter.</p>
        <p>Both Sosa and Gonzalez have no-trade clauses in their contracts and can veto any deal. Sosa could command a salary of about $18 million to $20 million per season, and may get another four-year extension beyond his current deal, which expires after the 2001 season. Gonzalez, a two-time most valuable player for the Texas Rangers, can become a free agent after this year.</p>
        <p>To make a deal for Gonzalez the Yankees will likely have to part with either Soriano or Henson, although it's not known whether either has been offered.</p>
        <p>Adam Katz, one of Sosa's agents, heard one report that the Yankees and Cubs have completed a deal ''but that doesn't make any sense,'' Katz said early tonight, ''because they'd have to go through us to get a deal done, and we haven't heard anything.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees have also made inquiries about Moises Alou of Houston and B. J. Surhoff of Baltimore.</p>
        <p>Vizcaino, 32, drove in the go-ahead run in the Dodgers' victory over Houston Tuesday night. Immediately after the game, he was told he had been traded to the Yankees. By chance, Vizcaino had watched the Yankees' game against the Chicago White Sox on Sunday. Vizcaino said he told himself, ''Before I retire, I want to play in Yankee Stadium.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees also received $500,000 as part of the deal. Vizcaino is making $3.5 million this year, so the Yankees will pay about $900,000 for keeping the infielder for the rest of the season.</p>
        <p>Vizcaino, who was hitting .204 in 93 at-bats for the Dodgers, will be used as a backup -- most prominently in relief of Chuck Knoblauch, who is coping with throwing problems. Leyritz, 36, was batting .218 for the Yankees, with one home run in 55 at-bats, and had no defined role. Leyritz said before he left the team today that what made him most upset was leaving players he had played with for many years.</p>
