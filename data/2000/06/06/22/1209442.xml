        <p>Investigators released photographs yesterday of two more men wanted in connection with the sexual attacks in Central Park after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade.</p>
        <p>Assistant Chief William Taylor, the head of Manhattan detectives, has also lowered the number of suspects still being sought from 22 to 14, including the 2 in the new images.</p>
        <p>''These people are all arrestable at this point,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other new details emerged as well, including the fact that another suspect -- a young man from Connecticut -- has arranged to surrender to the police today. Chief Taylor also said that the detectives had obtained 26 videos of the mob that overwhelmed women on June 11 near Central Park South and the Avenue of the Americas.</p>
        <p>In addition, Chief Taylor said, four men who were initially thought to be involved in the assaults were dropped from the suspect list without charges after questioning.</p>
        <p>In one case, the chief said, a man who the police thought had been attacking a woman was actually trying to protect her from the men who doused dozens of victims with water, tore at their clothes and sexually abused them.</p>
        <p>''He was shielding her, this particular guy,'' the chief said. The authorities declined to release the man's name.</p>
        <p>The announcement yesterday was a shift from Tuesday, when Police Commissioner Howard Safir said detectives still hoped to apprehend 22 men. But yesterday, Chief Taylor said that the latest reviews of the tapes with the victims led him to believe that only 14 men were still wanted. He said that he did not know how many men would ultimately be accused, and that the investigation was continuing.</p>
        <p>Deputy Inspector John Cutter, commanding officer of Manhattan North Detectives, said that a close examination of the new photographs showed that one man was wearing a football jersey with the word ''Panthers'' on it; the other was wearing a tan or yellow hat and a sleeveless T-shirt with a word that starts with the letter G.</p>
        <p>The authorities said they hoped the latest photographs, one of which shows the man in the sleeveless shirt grabbing a woman's breast as she tries to push through a pack of men, will spur a new round of telephone calls to the department's Crimestoppers tip line, 1-800-877-TIPS.</p>
        <p>To date, the police said, the line has received 266 tips from people claiming to recognize the attackers.</p>
        <p>The authorities also said that some suspects were believed to live outside the metropolitan area, and that the department was contacting police departments as far away as Washington and Massachusetts to seek help in the investigation. Further, the authorities have posted the photographs on the Internet. By last night, they were available at http://www.nyclink.org/html /nypd/html/wanted.html.</p>
        <p>The new pictures were released as a state grand jury handed up three new indictments in the case. Julio Delacruz, 22, and Trevor Britton, 19, were indicted on one count each of first-degree sex abuse and riot; Isaiah Forbes, 18, was indicted on two counts of sex abuse and one of riot.</p>
