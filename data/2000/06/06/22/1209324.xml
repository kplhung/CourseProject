        <p>The labor movement's rocky relationship with the Gore campaign  takes a new turn today when James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters president, appears alongside Ralph Nader at a news conference and is expected to shower praise on him.</p>
        <p>Teamster officials said yesterday that Mr. Hoffa was not prepared to  endorse Mr. Nader for president but would urge that any presidential debates include him and Patrick J.

        <p>The labor movement's rocky relationship with the Gore campaign  takes a new turn today when James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters president, appears alongside Ralph Nader at a news conference and is expected to shower praise on him.</p>
        <p>Teamster officials said yesterday that Mr. Hoffa was not prepared to  endorse Mr. Nader for president but would urge that any presidential debates include him and Patrick J. Buchanan rather than being limited to Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees.</p>
        <p>Michael Mathis, the Teamsters' political director, said the union wanted the debates to include Mr. Nader, who seeks the Green Party's nomination, and Mr. Buchanan, who wants to be the Reform nominee,  because they were likely to raise the issues the Teamsters most care about: trade, globalization and their effect on the American worker.</p>
        <p>But beyond that, the Hoffa-Nader appearance today, in Washington, will be a pointed reminder to Mr. Gore that large segments of organized labor remain bitterly unhappy with him over his support for the China trade deal, which cleared a huge hurdle with passage in the House last month.</p>
        <p>Ever since the Clinton administration began pushing normalized trade relations with China, Mr. Gore has been trying to placate labor leaders and their rank and file, whose support is considered crucial in November. But though he won the endorsement of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. last fall, the Teamsters, with 1.4 million members, and the United Automobile Workers, with 800,000, have so far withheld their backing, largely because of their anger over the trade bill, which the unions fear will speed an exodus of American manufacturing jobs to China.</p>
        <p>''The call to include Nader and Buchanan in a debate is all about putting trade in the forefront,'' Mr. Mathis said. ''Part of the idea behind the news conference is to highlight the fact that Nader, and to some extent Buchanan, are the two presidential candidates talking about these issues, and talking about them in a way we agree with.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader is to give a speech to the Teamsters' executive board in Washington today, before the news conference. Teamster officials are lavishing more praise on him than on Mr. Buchanan, noting that unlike Mr. Buchanan, he has often complained that shortcomings in the nation's labor laws make it too hard for workers to form unions.</p>
        <p>''Jim Hoffa has been on the record that there's no way we would support Buchanan,'' Mr. Mathis said. ''Nader is top to bottom much more in tune with labor, and he has a history of supporting workers, while Buchanan is somewhat of a Johnny-come-lately. It's not out of the question for us to endorse Nader.''</p>
        <p>Like the Teamsters, the auto workers have expressed interest in Mr. Nader's campaign. Last month, shortly before the House approved the China trade bill, Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W. president, announced that his union would explore Mr. Nader and other alternatives to the nominees of the two major parties. He denounced Mr. Gore and President Clinton, saying they had  ''once again sided with multinational corporations against workers here and abroad.''</p>
        <p>John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., flew to Detroit to have lunch with Mr. Yokich yesterday, largely to discuss the endorsement that the auto workers have withheld from Mr. Gore, labor officials said. Mr. Sweeney, one of Mr. Gore's most powerful backers, has also been one of the most enthusiastic, saying that while labor disagrees with the vice president over the China deal, they are aligned on most issues.</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. Gore's efforts to mend fences with labor suffered a setback last week when he named Commerce Secretary William M. Daley chairman of his campaign. Many union leaders saw the appointment as a slap in the face because Mr. Daley was the Clinton administration's chief strategist in the Capitol Hill fight over the trade bill.</p>
        <p>Denise Mitchell, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s communications director, acknowledged yesterday that Mr. Nader's campaign was attracting labor support. ''I hear a lot of people saying Nader has a very good message,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ''But the practical matter is we have to figure out how to elect a president who will stand up for workers every day. No candidate's going to be perfect, and we don't have the luxury of supporting a message candidate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yokich is facing considerable heat from within the U.A.W. about the reluctance to endorse Mr. Gore. Douglas Fraser, a former president of the union, sharply criticized Mr. Yokich's position in a speech last week before an association representing thousands of retired union  members.</p>
        <p>''The U.A.W. should endorse Gore,'' Mr. Fraser said in an interview. ''The reason is there is no viable alternative. Nader is not an alternative. Politics is not playing a game. Nader's done some constructive things, but the simple fact is he has zero chance of being elected president. The politics of the situation is every vote Nader gets is a vote he takes away from Al Gore, not George Bush. He shouldn't be playing around, because he has absolutely no chance, no matter what his virtues are.''</p>
        <p>Paul Krell, the U.A.W.'s spokesman, said: ''We haven't closed the door on Gore. We've just opened the door to Nader.''</p>
