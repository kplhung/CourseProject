        <p>A18</p>
        <p>Testimony on Los Alamos Lab  Energy Secretary Bill Richardson weathered a bipartisan storm of criticism over his handling of the latest security breach at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

        <p>Belated Military Honors  Seven Asian-Americans, including Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, received the Medal of Honor at the White House, the result of a review that concluded that 22 Asian-American servicemen in World War II had been wrongly denied the honor.</p>
