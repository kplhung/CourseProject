        <p>THE price was just too good to be true. When a man came into Lewis Bobrick's gallery in Denver recently trying to sell antique Navajo rugs for next to nothing, Mr. Bobrick worried that the rugs might be stolen. While the man waited in his store to see if there was a buyer for the unique rugs, Mr. Bobrick went to the Antique Tribal Art Dealers Association Web site (www.atada.org), where photographs and descriptions of stolen tribal artifacts can be posted.</p>

        <p>THE price was just too good to be true. When a man came into Lewis Bobrick's gallery in Denver recently trying to sell antique Navajo rugs for next to nothing, Mr. Bobrick worried that the rugs might be stolen. While the man waited in his store to see if there was a buyer for the unique rugs, Mr. Bobrick went to the Antique Tribal Art Dealers Association Web site (www.atada.org), where photographs and descriptions of stolen tribal artifacts can be posted.</p>
        <p>''I was just really suspicious they were stolen,'' Mr. Bobrick said of the rugs, which were potentially worth thousands of dollars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bobrick's suspicions were confirmed when he learned through the site that the rugs had been stolen from a gallery in Arizona two weeks earlier. Although the man left the store before Mr. Bobrick could call the police, Mr. Bobrick made calls to other gallery owners in the area, and the man was arrested at another gallery.</p>
        <p>Jamie Kahn, co-director of David Cook Fine American Art in Denver, used the site last fall when two men tried to sell Navajo rugs to her at a low price. ''It's definitely the first place I go if someone comes into our shop and there is something fishy about the deal,'' Ms. Kahn said.</p>
        <p>''We always ask the source of the objects.  If they are evasive or don't seem to know the value, then we become suspicious.''</p>
        <p>Theft of artwork, artifacts and antiques is an international problem and not, of course, limited to tribal works. Other less specialized sites offer similar theft-alert services.</p>
        <p>Among them is the Art Loss Register, www.artloss.com, a database service that tracks international missing valuables like paintings and antiques and says it has helped recover more than 1,000 items since its inception in 1991.</p>
        <p>The site includes a section about artwork that was lost during the Holocaust, a lost-and-found page where visitors can read about the successful recovery of some artwork, and photographs -- which can be enlarged for better viewing -- of each currently missing object. A theft alert page on another site, www.fineanddecorativeart .com, allows viewers to scroll through a list of missing property. Among the items listed are an oil painting stolen from a home in Ireland last February and a communion service setting taken from a church in Massachusetts. A few of the postings even offer a description of the suspect -- the culprit in the theft of an heirloom replica stove in Ohio is described as ''a woman 5 feet 10 inches, dark hair, ice green eyes, a boney looking face and low raspy voice.'' (The stove replica is worth $5,000 to $10,000.)</p>
        <p>Major thefts are listed at the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Stolen Art File (www.fbi.gov/majcases/arttheft /art.htm) and at Interpol's Cultural Property Program site (www.usdoj.gov/usncb /culturehome.htm). Among the listings at the F.B.I. site are a Renoir painting and a Stradivarius violin.</p>
        <p>There is also a page dedicated to one of the most audacious museum thefts of recent times, the robbery at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990. Works by Manet, Degas, Rembrandt and Vermeer worth several hundred million dollars were among those stolen by two men, posing as Boston police officers, who tied up the museum's security guards and took the video surveillance tape with them when they left.</p>
        <p>While no single Indian-art theft can match the Gardner Museum robbery in magnitude, there are plenty of smaller thefts noted on the tribal art dealers' site. The list includes images and descriptions of Hopi bowls and jars stolen from a California museum, Navajo rugs stolen from a residence in Wyoming, photogravures by the Indian photographer Edward Curtis missing from a gallery in Washington and dozens of other American Indian collectibles.</p>
        <p>Although the Antique Tribal Art Dealers Association (Atada) is a membership organization, any individual or business can post a notice about lost or stolen goods, and officials at the site have previously posted notices on behalf of the Zuni Pueblo in New Mexico and the Hopi Indians when they learned of thefts of tribal art.</p>
        <p>There is no fee to post a theft alert on the site, and a gallery owner in New Mexico who lost goods to thieves last month said that was quite a saving.</p>
        <p>''We spent about $800 to make some color brochures that we could give out,'' said the theft victim, Al Anthony Jr., owner of the Adobe Gallery in Albuquerque. ''It didn't cost anything but a little time to post the pictures on our own site or Atada.''</p>
