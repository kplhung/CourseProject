        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While no one can deny the rudeness of many cell phone users (''No, I'm Not Talking to You,'' June 8), the phenomenon of shouting into cellular phones is mostly a result of their design.</p>
        <p>The traditional (wired) telephones we have all grown up with provide audio feedback to the speaker through the handset: if you yell into the phone, you also yell into your own ear.</p>
        <p>Cell phones provide no such audio feedback to the speaker. Therefore cell phone users, trained to expect audio feedback, hear the people they are talking to more loudly than they hear themselves, so they think that they are speaking too softly. So they raise their voices until the volume of their own voices equals that of callers'. Since the ear that expects the feedback is covered by the cell phone, a phone user must shout to match the incoming volume.</p>
