        <p>The British Broadcasting Corporation is charging that the death of one of its drivers in an Israeli tank attack in southern Lebanon last month occurred in an apparently deliberate and unprovoked strike on a civilian target, an accusation Israel strongly denies.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the BBC in London are investigating whether Israel can be accused of a war crimes violation under the Geneva Convention, BBC correspondents here said.</p>
        <p>The Israeli Army acknowledged on Friday that Abed Takkoush, who was a driver and news assistant for the BBC in Lebanon for 25 years, was killed by an artillery shell fired at his car by an Israeli tank on May 23, as Israeli forces were hastily withdrawing from southern Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Israeli Army spokesmen at first disavowed responsibility for the incident, saying the attack might have been the work of the South Lebanon Army, Israel's local ally in its since-abandoned border security zone.</p>
        <p>The BBC then submitted its own detailed report on the incident to Israeli authorities, including extensive video footage from the BBC and four other television news organizations, which appears to document conclusively an unprovoked attack on Mr. Takkoush's blue Mercedes by an Israeli Merkava tank stationed about 4,000 feet away, inside Israeli territory.</p>
        <p>Jeremy Bowen, the BBC reporter whom Mr. Takoush had driven to the scene, witnessed the devastating impact from a few hundred feet away.</p>
        <p>''I saw Abed lurch out of the driver's side of the car and then fall to the ground,'' Mr. Bowen said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowen said that as he headed toward the burning car he was met by a burst of machine-gun fire from the Israeli border. A Lebanese Red Cross truck also came under fire as it tried to approach the vehicle, he said.</p>
        <p>There had been no gunfire, rocket attacks or artillery exchanges that day, as Mr. Bowen and his crew drove through the newly abandoned ''security zone'' toward the Israeli border. With his cameraman, Malek Kenaan, Mr. Bowen walked about a hundred yards from their parked car to set up equipment for a broadcast report, while Mr. Takkoush stayed behind in the car, talking to his son in Beirut by mobile phone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowen was close enough to the border to wave at local kibbutz residents surveying the scene from the other side of the fence.</p>
        <p>''Everything was quiet,'' he said. ''We had no idea that we were in any danger.''</p>
        <p>In its statement on Friday accepting responsibility for what it termed ''a tragic accident,'' the Israeli Army said the tank crew had been warned of a possible attack by Hezbollah guerrillas and mistook the BBC's tripod and camera for an antitank missile launcher.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, in a meeting with BBC correspondents, senior aides to Prime Minister Ehud Barak said the Defense Ministry had ordered a further investigation into Mr. Takkoush's death. There is a ''possibility'' that the military investigators might recommend financial compensation for Mr. Takkoush's family, said Gadi Baltiansky, Mr. Barak's chief spokesman.</p>
        <p>Though the new investigation is just now under way, Mr. Baltiansky said the government was convinced that the tank crew and the commanders who authorized the attack had legitimate grounds to believe that they were witnessing preparations for a missile attack. ''I can understand the mistake, though I cannot justify it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The BBC challenges the Israeli Army's account, noting that at the time and place the army now says it was anticipating a Hezbollah missile attack, the army had permitted a crowd of Israeli civilians to gather at the border fence to observe the army's evacuation from the zone. The BBC notes further that it was the car that was singled out, not the crew, which the Israeli Army said it had ''mistakenly identified as a terrorist group.''</p>
        <p>Most seriously, the BBC contends in its report that news film shows that the Israeli Army ''appeared to be sporadically targeting vehicles'' driven by Lebanese civilians along the same stretch of road earlier on May 23 and on May 22, despite the absence of any ''retaliatory fire from the Lebanese side of the border.''</p>
