        <p>The Mets have held a lead in each of their last 17 games, but they have lost eight times in that span. Their defeats have been bitter -- a blown save, a missed chance to score, a wild throw -- and last night's may have been the worst.</p>

        <p>The Mets have held a lead in each of their last 17 games, but they have lost eight times in that span. Their defeats have been bitter -- a blown save, a missed chance to score, a wild throw -- and last night's may have been the worst.</p>
        <p>''It seems like that one little mistake we've been making has been hurting us,'' said Mike Piazza.</p>
        <p>But there was more than one mistake last night. Blame was everywhere.</p>
        <p>Al Leiter chastised himself for losing a three-run lead against the Phillies' ace, Curt Schilling. John Franco was disgusted at allowing the decisive bases-loaded walk in the ninth inning. Bobby Valentine said he never should have brought in Armando Benitez, who allowed a grand slam to Pat Burrell that sealed a 10-5 victory by the Phillies.</p>
        <p>Valentine said his team was playing well. ''We're just hiccuping every once in a while,'' he said, and that is why the Mets remain four and a half games behind the first-place Atlanta Braves in the National League East.</p>
        <p>The Phillies are one of three sub-.500 teams the Mets host before the Braves come to town next week. A major reason the Phillies could sweep the Mets tonight is Burrell, their rookie first baseman who was a No. 1 overall draft pick.</p>
        <p>Burrell cracked a game-tying homer off Benitez in the ninth inning Tuesday, and the Mets lost by a run in the 10th. Last night, Leiter jammed Burrell with a slider in the sixth, but the pitch wound up over the left field fence to give the Phillies a lead. In the ninth -- after Franco had walked Kevin Jordan to give the Phillies a 6-5 lead -- Burrell whacked a pitch into the left-center-field bleachers for his first career grand slam.</p>
        <p>''He's always done that, whenever I've seen him,'' Mets left fielder Jason Tyner said of Burrell, a former teammate on a college national team. ''I've never seen him struggle, to be honest.''</p>
        <p>The Phillies' ninth began when Doug Glanville's high chopper skittered through the right side of the infield for a single. Ron Gant, who had four hits, including a homer, blooped a double to left.</p>
        <p>Had Benitez been fresh, Valentine said, he would have called for him then. But Benitez threw 32 pitches on Tuesday, and he was taking a while to get loose in the bullpen. Franco stayed in, struck out Scott Rolen, and issued an intentional walk to load the bases.</p>
        <p>Facing Jordan, Franco threw the pitch he wanted, a 3-2 change-up. But it missed, and the Phillies re-gained the lead.</p>
        <p>''Infield hit, broken-bat double down the line -- they're still base hits,'' Franco said. ''Walking in the winning run? I'm kind of disgusted with myself.''</p>
        <p>Franco had allowed a run only once in his last 10 appearances, and he said he had finally gotten his earned-run average ''down to where it's respectable.''</p>
        <p>Burrell's homer inflated it again. Benitez, who worked 17 consecutive scoreless innings before Tuesday, never should have been in the game, Valentine said.</p>
        <p>''I regret bringing him out, period,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Leiter, who had pitched so well the Mets had gone 12-1 in his starts before last night, was also upset with himself. Leiter had a 3-0 lead on Piazza's 436-foot, two-run homer in the first and another run in the second. But the Phillies tied it in the third, Burrell put them ahead in the sixth, and Schilling got stingy.</p>
        <p>''When you have a lead like that against a guy like that, you've got to be able to shut them down,'' Leiter said. ''I didn't.''</p>
        <p>Schilling, who had shoulder surgery last winter, had a fastball that averaged just 86-88 miles per hour. But he compensated with off-speed pitches and held the Mets to three singles in his last five innings.</p>
        <p>Schilling has a complete no-trade clause, and though he said he would waive it to play for a New York team, the Phillies have no interest in dealing him, a club official said.</p>
        <p>Schilling will make $6.5 million next year, the last year of his contract, and if the Phillies are going to contend next year, they must have Schilling to front their rotation.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>DARRYL HAMILTON does not want to cause controversy, and when he comes off the disabled list, he won't get it, at least not from JAY PAYTON, who has played an exceptional center field in his absence. Hamilton will probably return early next month, and he said that when he comes back his goal is to play center again. That would bump Payton, presumably to left. If that happens, Payton said he would not mind. ''When there are veteran guys who are there, you have to wait your time out until things work out for you,'' Payton said. ''But if I'm playing, I'm happy, whether it's left, center, right or wherever.'' . . . KURT ABBOTT has a .389 career average off CURT SCHILLING, but Abbott had tightness in his back last night, and MELVIN MORA started at shortstop.</p>
