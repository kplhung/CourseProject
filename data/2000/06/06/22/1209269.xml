        <p>FELDER RUSHING'S yard looks as if a collection of folk art had flown overhead, hit a sudden Mississippi thunderstorm and made a crash landing. All the other bungalows on the street have quiet little aprons of grass with a few azaleas or clipped forgettable evergreens or a magnolia tree.</p>
        <p>You can't even see the Rushings' house. Its gray shingles and red door are hidden behind yaupon hollies, a tall Chinese parasol tree with big chartreuse leaves, staghorn sumac, green baffles shaped like Christmas trees and a blue picket fence topped with colored bottles. There's not a blade of grass here, and this is the home of the state turf specialist.</p>
        <p>''Come meet Granny's chicken,'' Mr. Rushing said, leading the way to a shrine of sorts to his grandmother: an upturned old-time bathtub decked out in glass doorknobs and shards of old mirrors (which reflect fractured pieces of the garden as well as any visitor's face), surrounded by plastic white calla lilies and tall sticks of rebar topped with upside-down blue bottles. A white concrete chicken, chipped with age, peers out from behind a patch of liriope.</p>
        <p>Granny's chicken accompanies Mr. Rushing when he lectures at the Smithsonian Institution, Longwood Gardens, the Philadelphia Flower Show and other hotsy-totsy places. So any snobs out there can relax. This is vernacular art.</p>
        <p>''Granny was basically just a hillbilly with her concrete chicken and her zinnias,'' Mr. Rushing said, pronouncing the word the Southern way, ZEEN-yuhs. ''When I first learned about powdery mildew, it was on Granny's zinnias. I don't think she realized how clever it was to have a peely painted white concrete chicken that sort of echoed the color of the powdery mildew. It was almost designer-esque.'' He laughed softly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rushing, 48, has written six garden books, including ''Gardening Southern Style'' (University Press of Mississippi, 1987), which was turned into a television series. His work has appeared in numerous magazines, and he writes a twice-a-week column for The Clarion-Ledger of Jackson and is the host of a Saturday radio show heard on 24 stations in the Southeast. After 20 years as a horticultural expert for the Mississippi Agriculture Department, he knows every inch of the state. And he's not ashamed of that chicken.</p>
        <p>''I'm from Indianola in the Delta, B. B. King's hometown,'' Mr. Rushing said. ''Granny lived on one side of the road, and my great-grandmother lived on the other. She was a garden club lady with parterres and 350 types of daffodils, all labeled.''</p>
        <p>There was a bit of ''cognitive dissonance between the two,'' he said, but both spirits seem to inhabit Mr. Rushing, who is just as comfortable swapping plants at the Flora Public Library as lecturing to rosarians at the American Rose Society.</p>
        <p>''I tell them to back off the hybrid tea roses,'' he said, digging up a philodendron called Xanadu for a swap later that morning. His garden is full of heirloom roses like Old Blush and a pink Noisette he grew from a cutting from a cemetery in Natchez, Miss.</p>
        <p>He promotes plants, old and new, that can withstand the humidity and drought of a Mississippi summer. Since he's Southern, people listen. ''My folks made a couple of fortunes logging down here until they cut down all the trees in southern Mississippi and then moved up to the Delta in the 1880's,'' he said. ''Then they made a couple of fortunes farming until we wore the soil out. Now we all work for the government.''</p>
        <p>On a summer's night, when the fireflies are out and the bullfrogs are croaking from the water garden, he and his wife, Terryl, a lawyer, like to rock in their rubber tire rocking chairs, catch up with their children, Ira, 14, and Zoe, 10, and drink Rolling Rock by the fire, which burns in an old propane tank that looks rather upscale, with the curved rods welded onto its rim. (So nice, in fact, that Rich Griffin, a landscape architect who lives in a gated community across town, has stolen the very idea.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Griffin said, ''They never teach landscape architects anything about plants in school.'' He was standing by the tire planter, and a neighbor said that he'd been hanging around Mr. Rushing too long. ''I took that as a compliment.'' he said. ''I first heard Felder on the radio and decided, This man is going to be my friend.'' He liked the way Mr. Rushing described plants he had never heard of (like the Chinese parasol trees).</p>
        <p>''He's not conventional, he breaks the rules, and I'm the same way,'' he added. Mr. Griffin is known for the fine gardens he designs around Jackson. His own oil-tank fire pit -- wide, low and elegant -- is set in a circle of brick. ''I paid $5 for this and had a friend weld a rim,'' he said. He sells smaller ones for $500 to his clients.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Griffin has helped Mr. Rushing redesign his front yard. ''The path looked like a tongue,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''I got him to think in circles.''</p>
        <p>Now, their wives can't get them out of Dumpsters when the four go out to eat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rushings' yard is an over-the-top version of what he calls ''old lady gardens.'' To a man who adores his grandmothers, it's the highest compliment. ''It's not an age or a gender thing, it's a style,'' Mr. Rushing said. ''I've got an old lady garden. It's things planted every which way. They plant the way they like, where they like, how they like. Anybody who doesn't like it can go home.''</p>
        <p>The old lady garden is all the plants your grandmother grew, tough old ''pass-alongs,'' like Jewels of Opar, which looks like a sedum with an airy spray of white flowers, and an upright morning glory, which is a woody plant you'd never find in a garden center.</p>
        <p>Old lady gardens have diversity, but not much order. They were a backlash against the orderly Victorian garden, he said.</p>
        <p>Then he got into a little history of Southern gardening. ''We didn't have garden centers,'' he said. ''We had plant peddlers who would go town to town, like the Fuller Brush man. They had a lot of bare-root stuff, and a lot of seeds, and sometimes the peddlers would see something really neat, and get it started themselves. They were always easy to grow and easy to propagate.''</p>
        <p>People in those towns tended to collect things, like concrete chickens and pink flamingos. ''That's a genuine pink flamingo, autographed by the man who patented it, Donald Fetherstone in 1957,'' Mr. Rushing said. He keeps his flamingo parked by the camellia growing out of a tire planter.</p>
        <p>Then he was off in his Jeep Cherokee to the town of Flora, 20 miles northwest of Jackson, where 50 gardeners were at the library for plant swaps. ''Looks like we have a peach tree here,'' Mr. Rushing said.</p>
        <p>A woman called out, ''That peach tree has been in the Hardy family for 50 years, Felder.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rushing whipped out his Felco pruners and snipped off a few branches. ''Always cut it back a little bit, to force it to have a nice shape,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The woman continued: ''I brought a floribunda rose for you, because last year you said you wanted one. You'll want to trim that one, too.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rushing, smiling, said: ''Mama says not to thank you for it. Or it won't grow.''</p>
        <p>Someone else had brought in a night-blooming cereus, nothing more than a scraggly green leaf. ''It's one of the ugliest plants you've ever seen in your life,'' Mr. Felder said. ''It's one of the most exotic looking, most fragrant flowers you'll ever meet.'' He told how his great-grandmother used to call the kids over to her porch, where they'd sit all night on the swing, waiting for it to bloom. ''She didn't have a television because she thought it was the devil,'' he said. ''And if the cereus didn't bloom, we talked about everybody who wasn't there.''</p>
        <p>So it went. A good salvia, S. guaranitica. A sweet william that will come back and come back, its donor said. Ginger lily, rose campion, Louisiana irises, the yellow ones.</p>
        <p>The next morning, Mr. Rushing was on his radio show, with calls coming in from loyal fans like Laverne Houston, who has a nandina as big as a house, because nobody told her it couldn't grow that big.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rushing speaks his mind on the overuse of chemicals, fertilizers that leach into the water table, pesticides that aren't necessary, irrigation systems to water lawns that should go dormant in a drought. ''We can't keep pouring drinking water out on our lawns, we can't keep pouring pesticides into the rivers,'' he said. ''But the only way you can get people to stop is to highlight people who aren't, and sooner or later, it gets into the subliminal mind.''</p>
        <p>Like that gardener at the Flora plant swap. He asked her to tell how she rooted her rose. ''I know how to root roses,'' he said. ''But she had more credentials than me, because she's a real gardener and I'm from the university. And this countrywoman's word is going to win every time.''</p>
        <p>If you want to know the secret, go to a plant swap in Flora, Miss. Or ask Mr. Rushing at www.Felderrushing.com. Because he's really an old lady gardener at heart.</p>
