        <p>In five tiny rooms on the fourth floor of a glassed-in building in the middle of downtown Rio de Janeiro is a little stock exchange with large pretensions.</p>
        <p>Despite plummeting trade volumes around the region, the Sociedade Operadora do Mercado de Ativos, or Soma, wants to be the next Nasdaq -- and not just for Brazil, but for all of Latin America.</p>
        <p>''The recent volatility of stock markets abroad only shows how companies need to have a local listing,'' Romeu Pasquantonio, Soma's managing director, said in a recent interview. ''Besides, for many companies, listing on the Nasdaq is just not feasible.''</p>
        <p>Starting in the fall, the exchange plans a series of conferences in Brazil and other Latin American nations to bring technology and Internet companies together with investors. In the first steps, private companies would offer blocks of shares and seats on their boards to experienced venture capitalists in exchange for seed financing. The shares, which would then be listed on Soma, would be open for trade periodically -- anywhere from once a week to once a month, Mr. Pasquantonio said.</p>
        <p>''There are many venture capital companies entering the market now that don't have any way to exit their investments,'' Mr. Pasquantonio said. ''We want to provide that exit.''</p>
        <p>Soma was founded in 1996 by a group of brokerage houses that wanted to create a market for small-capitalization companies in Brazil. It is modeled after Nasdaq -- instead of a central trading floor, there is an electronically linked network of broker-dealers who trade stocks by way of computer screens.</p>
        <p>Before Soma's creation, the Brazilian market was dominated by the stock exchanges in Rio and Sao Paulo, with listing prices well out of reach of most of Brazil's small and medium-size businesses. Soma, with its $3,000 annual listing fee, offered an alternative to companies that needed to raise a relatively small amount of money. At the end of 1997, Soma had 34 listed companies. Today, it has 120.</p>
        <p>Besides the relatively low cost for companies to list their shares, Soma says that its advantage over the Sao Paulo stock exchange, or Bovespa, is that its system guarantees that investors will always have a buyer when they want to sell.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Soma hopes that the start-up companies it cultivates will go on to have their initial public offerings on the exchange, which would then be open to all investors.</p>
        <p>Now that volatility on the Nasdaq has caused international financing for Internet companies to slow to a trickle, Soma's local one-stop shop for financing is expected to be popular among Brazilian companies as well as investors.</p>
        <p>But although all indications point to Soma's continued growth, some uncertainly still surrounds the prospects for Brazilian financial markets as a whole.</p>
        <p>''There is no doubt about Soma's potential, but it is still too soon to be talking about it being the next Nasdaq,'' said Claus Buckmann, director of the Rio de Janeiro brokerage house Fator CVC. ''We are living through a moment of very low liquidity in general. Everything depends on how the market as a whole develops in Brazil.''</p>
        <p>At Soma, volumes are at a seven-month low, down to a daily average of $1.1 million last month. On the Bovespa, volume fell to a six-month low in May, when an average of $369.9 million changed hands each day.</p>
        <p>To try to build trading activity, the Bovespa announced late last week that it would enter negotiations with the New York Stock Exchange to participate in a proposed global linkup of stock exchanges in 10 nations. For Soma, experts say that a partnership with the Nasdaq appears to be the next logical step.</p>
        <p>''In the globalized world, there is no more room for small regional stock markets,'' said Alfried Ploger, the president of the Association of Open Capital Companies, a trade group here. ''There has to be an orientation toward global agreements, and those who don't participate are going to be left behind.''</p>
        <p>Nasdaq, which has exported its system of trading abroad and began operating a Japanese version on Monday, has been looking closely at Latin America. Nasdaq representatives visited Soma recently, as well as other stock markets in Latin America, to open talks on the creation of a regionwide exchange for small-cap stocks. Though Mr. Pasquantonio said the discussions were preliminary, he did not discard the possibility of an operational agreement with the Nasdaq in the future.</p>
