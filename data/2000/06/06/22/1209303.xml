        <p>Doing a Festival Mostly by Web</p>
        <p>When the Digital Club Festival grew out of the ashes of the bankrupt New Music Seminar in 1995, the concept was nothing new. It was simply 15 Manhattan club owners getting together to keep the beer flowing by programming a week of hundreds of rock bands and creating a pass allowing music fans to hear as much music as time, distance and club capacity permitted. The digital sideshow (it was called the Macintosh Music Festival that year) was achieved by installing computers in each club linked to a festival Web site that showed pictures from concerts in progress and let people at different clubs talk to one another.</p>
        <p>As technology progressed, so did the festival. Last year many concerts were shown live on the Web, creating what the festival organizers immodestly called the biggest Internet festival in the world. This year they have gone into conceptual overdrive. The festival has nearly abolished the physical component of the experience: there will be no more running around to dozens of clubs. This festival is not about selling beer in Manhattan anymore.</p>

        <p>Doing a Festival Mostly by Web</p>
        <p>When the Digital Club Festival grew out of the ashes of the bankrupt New Music Seminar in 1995, the concept was nothing new. It was simply 15 Manhattan club owners getting together to keep the beer flowing by programming a week of hundreds of rock bands and creating a pass allowing music fans to hear as much music as time, distance and club capacity permitted. The digital sideshow (it was called the Macintosh Music Festival that year) was achieved by installing computers in each club linked to a festival Web site that showed pictures from concerts in progress and let people at different clubs talk to one another.</p>
        <p>As technology progressed, so did the festival. Last year many concerts were shown live on the Web, creating what the festival organizers immodestly called the biggest Internet festival in the world. This year they have gone into conceptual overdrive. The festival has nearly abolished the physical component of the experience: there will be no more running around to dozens of clubs. This festival is not about selling beer in Manhattan anymore.</p>
        <p>Instead festival organizers have booked a couple of dozen well-known bands into 31 small clubs around the country from July 22 to 25. In a few cases the bands will play at the small bars where they first made their name. Blink 182 and X will be at the Casbah in San Diego; Ben Folds Five at the Cat's Cradle in Charlotte, N.C.; Throwing Muses and Steve Earle at Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel in Providence, R.I.; Aimee Mann at McCabe's Guitar Shop in Santa Monica; Yo La Tengo and Richard Thompson at Maxwell's in Hoboken, N.J.; Patti Smith at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Ga.; and Widespread Panic at Toads Place in New Haven.</p>
        <p>In Manhattan, Spacehog is booked at Arlene Grocery, Kittie at Irving Plaza, Freeheat (a Jesus and Mary Chain spinoff) at the Lakeside Lounge, Sonic Youth and Medeski, Martin and Wood at the Knitting Factory.</p>
        <p>The Digital Club Network, which has signed 55 clubs around the country to exclusive contracts for concert cybercasts and archiving, is running the festival and expects nearly two million fans to watch these bands as their performances are broadcast online through digital streaming technology (a one-time direct feed instead of a download).</p>
        <p>''At our first festival there was no such thing as streaming,'' said Andrew Rasiej, the former owner of the club Irving Plaza and the current chief executive of the Digital Club Network. ''We had stupid little pictures and text online. Then we experimented with ISDN lines and streaming technology, and sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. The way we're pushing the audience this year is by saying you can aggregate as large an audience as a Woodstock online. You're not going to have the same experience physically, but we're going to try and replicate it as best we can.''</p>
        <p>The replication of a live festival this year will even extend to concession stands. Online, Mr. Rasiej said, there will be pavilions for games, technology and even food and beer (which will be delivered to the doors of digital concertgoers through local online delivery services).</p>
        <p>One advantage to this type of festival is that if the bottled water costs three or four dollars, there won't be any rioting and destruction of public property, as there was at Woodstock 99. Maybe disgruntled concertgoers will just burn their own computers instead.</p>
        <p>Tickets to the shows are available through the box offices of the individual clubs, except in the case of the Blink 182 and Aimee Mann shows. Tickets for those will be available free through contests on the festival Web site, www.digitalclubfest.com.</p>
        <p>A Band Is Divided</p>
        <p>Dickey Betts, a guitarist in the Allman Brothers Band, intends to exercise a clause in his contract with the band today to demand arbitration with the group, said his lawyer, Christine Lapera.</p>
        <p>Mr. Betts, who has been in the group since its inception in 1968, was told by his bandmates on May 10 that he was not wanted on their summer tour. Though the band has cited creative differences with Mr. Betts, his spokesmen said he had no idea what their reason was and whether his ouster was to be temporary or permanent. Mr. Betts was briefly checked into a psychiatric hospital by the police in Sarasota, Fla., this month after he went on a rampage, smashing up his living room and threatening to kill himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Betts will ask to be reinstated and to be paid damages, Ms. Lapera said, though she declined to say how much. The legal proceedings, she said, will raise ''issues related to statements the band made in the press and the band's use of the trademark name the Allman Brothers.'' She continued, ''The claims are that the band has developed a public association with key members, and it is misleading to use it.''</p>
        <p>People who work with the Allman Brothers say that Mr. Betts was kicked out of the band only temporarily so he could deal with personal problems that were affecting his playing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Betts was unavailable for comment yesterday because he was in transit from his home in Florida to Manhattan to take the legal action, but a spokesman for him said that there were no personal problems and that recent reviews of the band's concerts had singled out Mr. Betts's guitar playing for praise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Betts, he added, was briefly hospitalized for depression, which was a reaction to ''the trauma of not being in the Allman Brothers after all these years.''</p>
        <p>Bert Holman, the manager of the Allman Brothers Band, said that this was the first he had heard of Mr. Betts's plan to take legal action and therefore had no comment.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 1, 2000, Saturday  A brief report in the Pop Life column on June 22 about a pop music festival on the Internet from July 22 to 25 misstated the location of the Cat's Cradle, one of the clubs across the country where acts will perform and appear on the Web at www.digitalclubfest.com. The Cat's Cradle is in Carrboro, N.C., not Charlotte.</p>
