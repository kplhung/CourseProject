        <p>LYING  A Metaphorical Memoir  By Lauren Slater  221 pages. Random House. $21.95.</p>
        <p>''If you've read my other books -- and I have written other books, 'Prozac Diary' and 'Welcome to My Country,' which I suggest you rush out and buy -- you would know that mental problems have been issues throughout my life,'' Lauren Slater notes helpfully in her third memoir. Nonetheless, though she has already cataloged a full litany of complaints including depression, anorexia and self-mutilation, Ms. Slater now locates a whole new vein of illness to mine. In ''Lying,'' she presents her lifelong history of epilepsy, but as the title suggests, there is a catch. Maybe this really happened to her. Maybe she is making it up.</p>
        <p>O.K., let's bite: why? For what reason would she have concocted this book's lovingly detailed auras and seizures? And if this memoir is merely a feat of gamesmanship, what would induce the reader to play along? Ms. Slater, who can be found posing on the front cover of each autobiographical volume, maintains that the essential truth of her story matters more than the particulars, and that the figurative meaning of epilepsy -- the falling, auras, seizures and memory lapses, not to mention the celebrity connections to van Gogh, Dostoyevsky et al. -- makes her own life easier and more interesting to explain. ''This is my tale,'' she says, ''and I have written it over and over again, and, depending on my mood and my auras, the story always seems to change, and yet it always seems true.''</p>
        <p>It won't always seem true to anyone bothering to compare this book with her earlier accounts. (Was she actually in a foster home, or did she spend her teenage years at home with her mother, whom she blames for everything?) But that, as Ms. Slater repeats endlessly here, is beside the point. The ''metaphorical memoir'' that she attempts is a refutation of literal-minded storytelling, as well as a response to the exaggerations that color many memoirs anyhow.</p>
        <p>''Everyone knows that a lot of memoirs have made-up scenes; that's obvious,'' she writes, in a memo advising Random House on how to market ''Lying.'' ''And everyone knows that half the time at least fictions contain literal autobiographical truths. So how do we decide what's what, and does it even matter?'' What she has in mind, she continues, is ''a book that takes up residence in the murky gap between genres, and by its stubborn self-position there, forces us to consider important things.''</p>
        <p>As it turns out, ''Lying'' flogs these important things to the point where they cease being important. It is not likely that the reader's interest in Ms. Slater's medical and philosophical condition will rival her own. And this book winds up working best as an imaginative coming-of-age memoir, one that exerts considerable narrative pull even if it should turn out to be science fiction. Only intermittently, as when Ms. Slater describes undergoing brain surgery, is there a deeply compelling reason to wonder why she might have chosen to invent such an episode, or what it means in her larger story.</p>
        <p>Noting that epileptics have tendencies toward mythomania and melodrama, Ms. Slater goes on to offer prodigious illustrations of both. In her early years, she says, she lied about having cancer. She stole things while in a state she regarded as a kind of seizure. She learned to fake epileptic episodes in hospital emergency wards all over Boston, and when she first began to write, she says, she experienced sexual ecstasy at the keyboard. She describes taking part in the Bread Loaf writers' conference in Vermont under a fake name, at 17, and encountering the very famous author with whom she had her first affair. Her writing, he told her, made him feel ''like I need a long cool shower.''</p>
        <p>Although this enveloping section of her book tells a familiar story, that of the young acolyte seduced by the worldly middle-aged man, Ms. Slater succeeds here in vibrantly evoking the episode and achieving the resonance she seeks. The link between sexual and epileptic abandon is clear, and it is well used to illuminate her ambivalent response to the affair. Also effective is the sense of the author as an assured manipulator of the story she tells. ''I didn't sleep with him,'' she tells a friend, soon after meeting this literary lion. ''But you will,'' the friend replies. ''And it will be such a cliche when it happens.''</p>
        <p>Later on, in an episodic book with sections named for the stages of an epileptic seizure (''Onset,'' ''The Rigid Stage,'' ''The Convulsive Stage,'' ''The Stage of Recovery''), Ms. Slater presents her most creative and wry bit of dissembling. In keeping with the spiritual and religious yearning that she says is also part of the epileptic's personality profile, she falls into step with a chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous even though she does not have -- or has not yet chosen to write a book about -- a drinking problem. And she finds, in the book's most natural illustration of metaphorical sweep, that her own pathology and those discussed by A.A. members are perfectly in sync. When it is time for her to offer a personal history, she is perfectly equipped.</p>
        <p>''I started, you know, doing it at home, at school, all the time, just stumbling around and making a real fool of myself,'' she tells the alcoholics. She speaks of relapses and petty theft and life in a dysfunctional family. She talks of her illness and the physical humiliation it brings. And when she is done, and her speech has been greeted with applause and tears, she goes home, has a drink and decides to confess her lie.</p>
        <p>But when Ms. Slater tries to tell the truth, her A.A. friends stop her and decide that she is just in denial. ''Shhh,'' one tells her. Says another, offering the perfect commentary on this book's self-importance about blurring fact and fiction, ''We see this all the time.''</p>
