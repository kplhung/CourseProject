        <p>A former lieutenant and four police officers in the Orange Police Department were charged today with federal civil rights violations in the beating and assault of a man who died an hour  after being mistakenly arrested in connection with the murder of another police officer.</p>
        <p>The indictment handed up today in United States District Court here was the culmination of a 14-month federal and state investigation into a case that was riddled with police mistakes, multiple charges of police brutality and wrongful arrests following the April 8, 1999, murder of the police officer, Joyce Carnegie.</p>
        <p>The case led to upheavals in both the Essex County prosecutor's office, which supervised the initial investigation into the murder of the officer,  and the Orange Police Department. It eventually led Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to remove the county's first black female prosecutor, Patricia A. Hurt, who directed the investigation. In the course of the investigations, officers failed to follow up leads in a timely fashion, delayed interviewing alibi witnesses for those wrongfully arrested, conducted a chaotic and uncoordinated investigation and often argued among themselves about how to proceed.</p>
        <p>According to the indictment, one of the police officers beat the man, Earl Faison, 27, when he was stopped on the street three days after the killing.</p>
        <p>He was kicked and punched by the officer while handcuffed and lying on the sidewalk, said Robert J. Cleary, the United States attorney for New Jersey, and was beaten by four of the officers after being laid in the back seat of a police car. One of those same officers later robbed Mr. Faison at gunpoint in a stairwell at the Orange police headquarters, according to the indictment.</p>
        <p>The indictment alleges that a fifth officer, Brian Smith, 30, sprayed pepper spray in Mr. Faison's mouth and nose at close range while he was being held in the stairwell area. The indictment charges all five officers with conspiracy in the incident; one officer with three acts depriving Mr. Faison of his civil rights; and the other officers with one act each of depriving him of his civil rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Faison, an East Orange resident and an aspiring rap artist, died about an hour after he was stopped by the police. If found guilty in the case, the officers face a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, higher penalties than under state law for the same charges.</p>
        <p>Calling the incident ''an act of vigilantism'' by police officers, Joseph R. Lewis, the special agent in charge of the Newark office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, added: ''It went against the fabric of law enforcement and all that it stands for.  A man, his family and the law enforcement community suffered because these officers served as judge and jury for Earl Faison.''</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Smith, an Orange resident, the others arrested were his brother, Thomas Smith, 35, of Caldwell, who was a lieutenant when he retired from the force in December on disability; Andrew Garth, 31, of Bloomfield; Tyrone Payton, 34; and Paul Carpinteri Jr., 36, of Orange. Four of the five officers were arrested at their homes early this morning and Brian Smith turned himself in to F.B.I. agents later in the morning. They all appeared today before United States Magistrate Dennis Mr. Cavanaugh, who set bail at $150,000 for Thomas Smith and $100,000 for the others. An arraignment was set for Monday.</p>
        <p>Maintaining their clients' innocence, the lawyers for all of the men portrayed them as the victims of lies and ''outrageous allegations'' by fellow Orange police officers who testified before a federal grand jury and by the powerful machinery of federal prosecutors, the F.B.I. and the Civil Rights Division of the United States Justice Department.</p>
        <p>''There was a lot of pressure brought in this case,'' said Peter Willis, a lawyer for Brian Smith.</p>
        <p>But for Earl Williams, Mr. Faison's father, who had contended from the beginning that his son had been beaten, the indictments were a vindication of sorts.</p>
        <p>''But until we find out exactly who was involved and what took place, we will have a lot of folks dissatisfied,'' he said, expressing his suspicion that others were involved in the death of his son.</p>
        <p>The federal indictment was likely to be the only charges growing out of the case. Chuck Davis, a spokesman for the state attorney general, John J. Farmer Jr., said that the office was not pursuing the case further because its cooperative and parallel investigation with federal authorities  had concluded ''that there was not enough evidence to support a homicide indictment'' in the incident.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cleary said the federal investigation focused on the beating and not the death of Mr. Faison because ''as we stand here today, we do not feel confident that we can prove the cause of death.'' Both he and lawyers for the family of Mr. Faison would not discuss the results of two autopsies, one by the Essex County medical examiner and one by a private pathologist retained by the family.</p>
        <p>According to a spokesman for Mr. Cleary, had the indictment linked the alleged actions of the officers to Mr. Faison's death and if the officers were successfully prosecuted, they  would have faced up to life in prison or the death penalty at sentencing, depending on how a judge weighed the circumstances of the cases.</p>
        <p>The murder of Officer Carnegie was the first death in the line of duty of an Orange officer in 33 years.</p>
        <p>She was shot once in the stomach and once in the head by a robbery suspect whom she chased in her patrol car. Her death produced an adrenaline-fueled investigation that led to the arrest of three suspects. Among them was Mr. Faison, who was in a cab stopped by the police on April 11.</p>
        <p>When they sought to question him, he fled. When officers caught him, they said, they found he had an illegal 9-millimeter automatic pistol. Police had already recovered another gun which they said had been used in the killing. Arrested on April 10 was a Newark man, James Coker,  who was said to have bragged about killing the officer, and a 24-year-old East Orange resident, Terrance Everett.</p>
        <p>The day after Mr. Faison died in police custody, the Essex County prosecutor, Patricia Hurt, formally charged Mr. Everett, who appeared at his arraignment with a black eye and a number of bruises. She defended investigators and not only denied allegations by Mr. Everett's lawyers that he was beaten by police, but said that her investigation of Mr. Faison's death had found no evidence that he was beaten.</p>
        <p>The families of Mr. Faison and Mr. Everett have filed lawsuits related to their arrests.</p>
        <p>Early in the investigation of Mr. Faison's death, Orange police and Ms. Hurt suggested that Mr. Faison, who had asthma, had died because of some complication from that condition. Eventually the case against Mr. Everett evaporated as witnesses placed him elsewhere at the time of Officer Carnegie's death, and some in Ms. Hurt's office began questioning the haste in which he had been charged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coker was never charged in the murder. Six days after Mr. Everett was charged, he was quietly released as Ms. Hurt and her investigators retreated behind a wall of no-comments. They refused to issue an apology to him for his ordeal.</p>
        <p>Two days later a fourth man, Condell Woodson, 25, who days before had been linked by investigators to the gun used in the killing, was arrested. He subsequently pleaded guilty to killing Officer Carnegie and was sentenced to life in prison in the shooting. But not before Ms. Hurt came under fire, not only for her handling of the investigation but also for spending irregularities in her office.</p>
        <p>In June 1999, the state attorney general appointed a monitor to oversee her office's investigations and spending. A month later, citing a general concern about ''the integrity of the criminal justice system in the state's largest prosecutor's office,'' Gov. Whitman removed Ms. Hurt and replaced her with Donald C. Campolo, an assistant attorney general.</p>
        <p>The news of the indictments came almost as an anticlimax to the months of investigations, during which F.B.I. agents had practically set up shop in the town's police headquarters and morale among the police force had plunged.</p>
        <p>Don F. Wactor, police director for Orange who replaced Richard Conte, who resigned last October after 27 years with the department, called it a ''troubling day'' for the city, and said that the four indicted officers still working for the department would be suspended without pay.</p>
        <p>''Obviously the officers here are not happy with what occurred,'' he said ''It can be demoralizing, but we will learn from this and make sure it never happens again.''</p>
        <p>The Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, the executive director of the New Jersey Black Ministers Council, said the case was the exception for Orange police officers, whom he said were generally very sensitive to citizens.</p>
