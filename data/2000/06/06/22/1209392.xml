        <p>After months of fitful negotiation that seemed to flame out in a final angry exchange in February, the two sides racing to decode the human DNA have contrived a last-minute truce. The first element of the resurrected pact is likely to be a joint announcement next week of the effective completion of the genome.</p>
        <p>Although it is too late for a pooling of DNA sequencing efforts, the truce will include agreement for the competitors to publish their genome findings in the same issue of a journal.</p>
        <p>It may also provide for a joint annotation of the genome, the critical process of identifying the location and role of the genes on the genome.</p>
        <p>Should the two sides cooperate in such an interpretation of their data, a step that has at least been under discussion, the truce could develop into a broader pact.</p>
        <p>The truce also implies a cessation of public criticisms between the two parties, the Celera Corporation of Rockville, Md., and an international consortium of academic centers supported largely by the National Institutes of Health and the Wellcome Trust, a London philanthropy.</p>
        <p>Although the institutes and the trust decline to discuss the deal, the trust has said it will hold a news conference on the human genome next Monday, and sources close to Celera say a joint news conference will be held at the White House at which the two sides will announce the progress of their respective efforts on sequencing the genome.</p>
        <p>Sequencing means determining the order of the three billion chemical units in the DNA of the human chromosomes. The genome sequence  is expected in time to revolutionize knowledge of the human body and the practice of medicine.</p>
        <p>The rival teams appear to have been driven together by a calculus that cooperation outweighed the attractions of laying claim to one of science's greatest prizes independently, especially now that each has achieved successes that vindicate its own approach.</p>
        <p>Celera has established the validity  of its high risk genome sequencing strategy, which the consortium's two senior scientists had predicted would be ''woefully inadequate.'' The consortium has generated a draft genome sequence that can be searched for human genes, a principal objective of the human genome project.</p>
        <p>Celera was set to declare victory in achieving an effectively complete genome assembly many months before the consortium could do so. But Celera's business plan is to sell genome data and genomic analysis tools to the community of university scientists from which the consortium is drawn. Claiming victory might have alienated potential customers.</p>
        <p>The consortium could have attacked Celera's genome as not being the real thing -- it still has many small gaps and makes use of the consortium's data -- while going on to declare its own independent victory, though perhaps as late as 2003.  The alternative, which it seems now to have embraced, was to accept Celera's proposal of declaring joint victory on Celera's timetable.</p>
        <p>''Celera doesn't want the N.I.H. to lose,'' said Dr. Norton Zinder, a microbiologist at Rockefeller University who is a member of Celera's scientific board.</p>
        <p>Dr. Zinder and Dr. Richard Roberts, the research director of New England BioLabs and chairman of Celera's scientific board, have for many months pushed for the two sides to collaborate and, when that idea foundered, at least to cooperate by coordinating publication.</p>
        <p>Both said they did not wish the institutes, the federal patron of most biomedical research, to seem to have suffered defeat at Celera's hands, and that the human genome was too precious a scientific achievement to be marred by priority disputes.</p>
        <p>''The discovery and presentation of the human genome, one of the most important attributes of man, should be a time of great joy and happiness,'' Dr. Zinder said. ''For there to be all this vitriol and hatred just doesn't seem right.'' Dr. Roberts, a Nobel laureate, said that the announcement of sequencing the human genome ''should be a great celebration of humankind, not a race with a clear winner or loser.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Zinder said talks began last October when Dr. Eric Lander of the Whitehead Institute, one of the five largest centers in the consortium, approached Dr. Roberts.</p>
        <p>A meeting took place on Dec. 29 that included Dr. J. Craig Venter, president of Celera, and Dr. Francis Collins, head of the N.I.H.'s National Human Genome Research Institute.</p>
        <p>The meeting went badly and quickly bogged down in issues like Celera's rights to distribute a combined set of human genome data.</p>
        <p>''The problem was there was no referee at the meeting who could have taken these guys by the scruff of the neck,'' Dr. Roberts said.</p>
        <p>The talks finally broke off in February in a fault-finding exchange of letters. It took a long time for bridges to be rebuilt.</p>
        <p>Dr. Zinder approached the institutes' new acting director, Dr. Ruth Kirschstein, and tried to arrange a second meeting that would exclude Dr. Collins, whom he felt had been in part responsible for the December failure. In any case, Dr. Venter refused to meet again with Dr. Collins.</p>
        <p>A second negotiation was arranged for March and at the last minute both Dr. Venter and Dr. Collins attended. ''Ruth insisted Francis had to come and wouldn't say a word; Francis swore he would be like a monk at that meeting, but he spoke up,'' and that meeting broke down too, Dr. Zinder said, adding that Dr. Venter ''put the same deal on the table as is there now.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Kirschstein said through a spokeswoman, Anne Thomas, that she had no recollection of promising Dr. Collins's silence and that the deal now being offered by Celera was not what was on the table then.</p>
        <p>Dr. Collins declined through his press secretary, Cathy Yarbrough, to comment on the negotiations with Celera. But he has always affirmed the policy of completely free and open access to the human genome.  Because Celera has demanded protection against its data being resold by its commercial rivals, data access policy has been a regular stumbling block to agreement.</p>
        <p>Following a cooling-off period after the failed March meeting, talks were held between Dr. Venter, Dr. Collins and Dr. Ari Patrinos, director of the Energy Department's part of the human genome project. From the post-March talks, an agreement eventually emerged.</p>
        <p>''The facts haven't changed much but the relationships have become more cordial,'' said Dr. Donald Kennedy, who as editor of Science has been involved in discussions about publication of the two sides' reports, probably sometime in the fall.</p>
        <p>An important element that has been under discussion is to hold a joint annotation jamboree, Dr. Zinder said.</p>
        <p>Annotation is the important first step in figuring out the genome's meaning. It consists first of finding the genes -- no easy task since their sequences occupy a mere 3 percent of the DNA in the genome -- and then of assigning functions to the genes.</p>
        <p>Celera and the consortium would probably hold a meeting of genetic experts to discuss the two sides' genomic data. Such an event could go far toward cementing the partnership and producing a product for which both could take credit.</p>
        <p>Other aspects of the deal seem more implicit. ''It's understood that Craig won't say 'I won,' '' Dr. Zinder said.</p>
        <p>The deal has been tightly held and consortium members do not seem aware of its details. A spokesman for the Wellcome Trust said, ''We haven't seen any terms of a truce'' and could not comment on them.</p>
        <p>The scientific community's verdict on who won is still pending because Dr. Venter has yet to release his data. Though Celera's version of the human genome is further advanced, it has relied on the consortium's data to an extent that may turn out to have been essential.</p>
        <p>The best way to sequence genomes may, in fact, be by a combination of Celera's whole genome shotgun strategy, which speedily yields the main structure, and the consortium's clone-by-clone strategy, which helps fill in the many remaining gaps.</p>
        <p>If so, the way would indeed be open for the two sides to agree on an honorable draw.</p>
