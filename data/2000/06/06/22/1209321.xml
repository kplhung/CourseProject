        <p>With an unusual number of important issues hanging in the balance, state lawmakers will convene here Thursday for what is supposed to be the last time this year, having almost, but not quite, struck deals on hate crimes, gun control and sexual assault.</p>
        <p>This is Albany's annual high-wire act, in which Gov. George E. Pataki, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, each wait for the others to blink, and much of the important business does not get done until the last, frenzied days. But the stakes are higher than usual, given the political and substantive weight of the issues under discussion.</p>
        <p>On issue after issue, officials in one or two of the three camps have reported in the last few days that after intensive negotiations there was an agreement in principle -- though the complex and contentious work of bill-drafting remained -- only to have one side or the other steadfastly deny any such agreement.</p>
        <p>Complicating matters, some of the criminal justice issues have been linked, so that there may not, in the end, be deals on any of them unless there are deals on all of them.</p>
        <p>''I would not be surprised if all of it comes together, and I would not be surprised if none of it does,'' a top legislative aide said today, as negotiations among the three leaders and their staffs continued into the night.</p>
        <p>There have been sporadic talks on a bill to change the Republicans' much-maligned rules for holding presidential primaries. All sides agree an accord is still possible, but none consider it highly likely, if only because the negotiators are dealing with so many other issues.</p>
        <p>A number of other highly charged proposals that have been discussed appear unlikely to produce agreement, including raising the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.75; making information on every doctor's history of malpractice suits, judgments and settlements available to the public through a Web site; adding judges to the New York City courts to relieve overcrowding; and easing Rockefeller-era drug laws.</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday was originally scheduled to be the last day of the  legislative session, but with so many issues unresolved, Mr. Silver, a Democrat, and Mr. Bruno, a Republican, agreed to have the Assembly and the Senate return for one day, Thursday. There is nothing to prevent them from convening again later in the year, but Mr. Bruno has ruled that out, saying that if there are no agreements Thursday, the Senate will pass its own versions of several bills, a take-it-or-leave-it gesture to the Assembly.</p>
        <p>The issue of hate crimes, where there is no real disagreement, has become mired in ego-driven squabbling, and while a deal still seems likely, it is far from certain. The Assembly and the Senate have passed similar bills providing longer criminal penalties for crimes whose victims are singled out due to bias based on race, sex, religion, age, sexual orientation or disability, an idea supported by the governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno has said he would not make the Senate, which has never passed a hate crimes bill before this year, vote on the issue again in the form of a compromise bill. Many Senate Republicans were upset at being forced to take a stand on the issue, and unhappy that its passage was widely portrayed as an attempt at finding political cover in an election year when the Republicans are worried about their hold on the Senate.</p>
        <p>A compromise could be enacted by having the Assembly pass the Senate bill, and then having both sides pass a second bill amending the first one, to reflect the compromise. But that way, New York's hate crimes law would go down in the books as having been a Senate bill, and that is unacceptable to the Assembly Democrats, who have passed a hate crimes bill 11 years in a row, and want to take credit for it. And in any case, it is not clear that the Senate Republicans would agree to an amending bill.</p>
        <p>Officials say that for some time, there has been agreement on a package of gun controls, much like those proposed earlier this year by the governor, that would be among the most restrictive in the country. They include a ban on assault weapons, mirroring the federal ban, a requirement that trigger locks be sold with all handguns and the creation of a ''ballistic fingerprinting'' computer database to track bullets and shell casings found at crime scenes so they can later be matched to guns.</p>
        <p>But the gun bill has been tied to an overhaul of New York's sexual assault laws, an issue that got new impetus with last week's attacks on women in Central Park. Officials say that to a lesser degree, both are also linked to proposals to curb school violence and to the hate crimes bill -- if only in the psychology of the Capitol, which often dictates that a collapse in talks in one area can explode  deals in another.</p>
        <p>The governor, a Republican, and the Senate leaders are seeking tougher penalties for a variety of sex crimes, and they want to give prosecutors the right to appeal sentences and bail settings in sex crime cases. The Assembly's version raises some penalties, but focuses on improving services for victims, including ensuring coverage of emergency room services and counseling.</p>
        <p>Both sides have made concessions, particularly the Democrats, but there are still some significant differences.</p>
        <p>The Republican presidential primary rules became an issue earlier this year, when Mr. Pataki and the party took intense criticism for their unsuccessful efforts to keep John McCain off the ballot in New York. The governor and the Senate agreed on a bill to make it easier for candidates to get on the ballot, to simplify a ballot that voters had complained was confusing, and to make New York's a winner-take-all primary.</p>
        <p>Democrats say they have no objections to the Republicans' reforms -- which, in many ways, mirror the rules the Democrats have used -- but that the bill could interfere with the Democrats' ability to set their own presidential ballot rules. Mr. Silver has also questioned why a bill must be passed this year, with the next presidential primaries still almost four years away.</p>
        <p>A compromise bill has been discussed by aides to the governor and Mr. Silver, and while both sides sounded cautiously optimistic today, neither was predicting agreement by Thursday.</p>
