        <p>RESTORATION HARDWARE  (800) 762-1005</p>
        <p>THERE'S nothing used about this familiar retro-style equipment, and there is plenty available: all of the items here are in current production. The diner-style plastic mustard and ketchup squeezers, bound for picnics and barbecues, are $1.95 each. A 1950's-style one-quart thermos ($18) comes with the familiar red plastic cup and claims to keep beverages hot for 10 hours or cold for up to 24 hours. The nine-ounce tumblers with cheery cherries were inspired by a juice glass from the 1950's; $2.50 each. For measuring up to five pounds of ingredients, a classic low-tech enameled kitchen scale is $45.</p>
