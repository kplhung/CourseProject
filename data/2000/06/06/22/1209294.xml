        <p>It has been said that on a hot July day in a Midwestern cornfield, you can hear the corn growing. Whether or not that is true, Web surfers can watch corn as it grows on an Iowa farm.</p>

        <p>It has been said that on a hot July day in a Midwestern cornfield, you can hear the corn growing. Whether or not that is true, Web surfers can watch corn as it grows on an Iowa farm.</p>
        <p>CornCam presents fresh images every 15 minutes from a cornfield near Prairieburg, Iowa (www.IowaFarmer.com/corncam  /corn.html). Viewers can check regularly to see how much the crop has grown since it was planted in late April. (It is not quite as high as an elephant's eye.)</p>
        <p>The site includes information about the field (it was planted on April 30 without tilling, a method that conserves soil) and links to many other corn sites, including one dedicated to the Corn Palace in Mitchell, S.D.</p>
        <p>CornCam is operated by Iowa Farmer Today, a weekly newspaper, which is seeking sponsors for a SoyBeanCam.</p>
        <p>No word on whether a PaintDryCam is in the works.</p>
