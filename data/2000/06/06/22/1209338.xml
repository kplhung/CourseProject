        <p>When Hafez al-Assad died on June 10, his power and privileges passed to his eldest surviving son, Bashar, a 34-year-old eye doctor who is just a few formalities away from officially inheriting the Syrian presidency.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Assad is not the only heir to his father's 30 years of authoritarian rule.</p>
        <p>Behind him -- in the officer corps of the armed forces, the intelligence services, the palace guard and the ruling Baath Party command -- stand thousands of his fellow Alawites, members of a minority religious sect who owe their fortunes and their influence exclusively to Assad family patronage.</p>
        <p>Even before his father's death, Dr. Assad had begun to prune the political and military hierarchy of many of the old guard whose willingness to accept a continuation of the Assad dynasty was in question.</p>
        <p>But diplomats and Syrian analysts said that the overall number of Alawites in positions of power -- the army officers who give the real commands, the intelligence chiefs who monitor the population, the security officers in charge of neighboring Lebanon and the commanders of the presidential militias -- did not change and may well have increased.</p>
        <p>Their dominance is never openly discussed, however. It is a taboo in Syria to speak publicly about Alawite power or the power of any other minority. Syrian nationalism and Arab nationalism were supposed to have erased sectarian identities, under the ruling philosophy of the Assad government.</p>
        <p>''There is no such thing as an Alawite sect in Syria,'' declared Riyad Ghassan Agha, head of the political bureau of the presidency, in a recent interview on Al-Jezeera television.</p>
        <p>If Dr. Assad, like his father, surrounds himself with cousins, uncles and other members of the extended Alawite family, that is perfectly natural, he added. ''Do you think he would have his enemies as his assistants?'' Mr. Agha said. ''When you work, you have your friends and families around you. Otherwise it would be a power struggle.''</p>
        <p>For most of the late President Assad's reign, his favoritism toward Alawites was a source of much private resentment among Syria's traditionally dominant Sunni Muslim majority. In the early 1980's, the supremacy of the Alawites, historically regarded in Syria as heretics, was a spur for a violent rebellion by Islamic fundamentalists.</p>
        <p>The elder Mr. Assad dealt with the resentment by placing Sunni Muslims in a few high-profile ministries, like Foreign Affairs and Defense, and by permitting some Sunni merchant families to operate private businesses within his socialist state.</p>
        <p>He dealt with the Sunni fundamentalist rebellion by brutally crushing it. And he carefully courted other religious minorities in Syria, like Shiite Muslims and Christians, who also feared that they would be trampled if the Sunnis were to regain political power.</p>
        <p>Dr. Assad, his son, inherits that precariously balanced system of patronage and appeasement. With the Alawite clans behind him, analysts say, he may have the support he needs to retain power. But he also will always have to watch his back.</p>
        <p>''They hold the most important key positions and they can make a difference if they move,'' said an Arab diplomat in Damascus, referring to the Alawites in the army and security forces.</p>
        <p>''The question is now, do the Alawites believe that Bashar is the best man to represent and protect them?'' the diplomat added. ''This will take time to answer.''</p>
        <p>The Alawites, at about 1.5 million strong in Syria and representing about 12 percent of the country's population, are considered by some to be a distant offshoot of the Shiite branch of Islam. Most members of the sect live in Syria, although there are scattered communities in Turkey as well.</p>
        <p>Their belief system has been a matter of speculation, rumor and suspicion from more orthodox Muslims of both the Shiite and Sunni sects almost from their beginnings in the ninth century, when the branch was founded by a man named Ibn Nusayr, who declared himself the gateway to truth.</p>
        <p>Only a small group within the sect are initiated into Alawite rituals and doctrine. But researchers who have studied the group say they drink wine in some ceremonies, incorporate elements of Phoenician paganism, and hold that Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, is a divine. All of that is anathema to conventional Islam.</p>
        <p>During French rule over Syria between the end of the First World War and 1946, the Alawites joined other non-Muslim minorities in the colonial army in suppressing the Sunni Muslims who were the vanguard of the independence movement.</p>
        <p>Alawite cooperation with the European and Christian colonizers of the region has marked their rule in Syria. It has been a reassuring factor for non-Arabs and non-Sunni Muslims, helping Syria retain the most stable religious diversity in the Middle East. But the Alawite history also made President Assad especially fierce in his anti-Zionism, as if to prove to other Arab leaders that he would never act less Arab or Muslim than they.</p>
        <p>The Alawite rise in Syria was dramatic. After independence, the Alawite clans retreated to the mountains around the coastal city of Latakia, which remains a base for the Assad family and its cronies. They were the poorest of Syria's citizens, sending their daughters to work as domestics in the homes of wealthy Sunnis in Damascus and their sons to low-paying jobs in the Syrian Army.</p>
        <p>The Baath Party takeover in 1966 provided a means for Alawite ascent. With its socialist and Arab nationalist motifs, the party attracted the ambitious young of minority groups long disenfranchised by the Sunni majority. By the time the late President Assad dispatched his party rivals and established his autocratic rule in 1970, the army's officer class was largely Alawite and so was the party command.</p>
        <p>Mr. Assad especially favored the tribes from his hometown of Qardaha in the Alawite Mountains along the Mediterranean coast. Even now, people in the town speak of his favors with awe: the free modern hospital, the free schools, the free houses, the special office in Damascus for Qardaha residents seeking jobs or money or food.</p>
        <p>''When I was growing up we lived in a mud house,'' recalled Hind Ahmed, a 44-year-old housewife in Qardaha. ''We had no electricity or running water. The streets were unpaved.''</p>
        <p>President Assad, she said, changed all that. When he would come home to visit, his grateful former neighbors would lift his car on their shoulders and parade it before the new home he gave them money to build. His brothers built palatial villas on the hilltops overlooking the village.</p>
        <p>One, Rifaat al-Assad, stationed his private militia in Qardaha and distributed meat and other food to the villagers regularly before he was exiled to Europe for trying to overthrow his brother. After the president's death, he declared himself the legitimate heir to the presidency from his new villa in Spain.</p>
        <p>For Mrs. Ahmed, any Assad would be acceptable as Syria's leader because he could be expected to continue the largesse.</p>
        <p>''For us, Rifaat is a great man and he was so nice to us when he was here,'' she said. ''Bashar is the same. For us the most important for us is that the president should come from the Assad family.''</p>
