        <p>Wiley Brooks was frustrated when he wanted to complain to a restaurant chain by e-mail about an undercooked hamburger. ''It wasn't easy to get a valid e-mail address,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Out of that frustration has come TellThemNow.com (www.tellthemnow.com), a Web site that Mr. Brooks said would make it easier to send electronic complaints or compliments to corporate leaders, politicians, journalists and celebrities. TellThemNow.com is similar to some other Web sites, like the recently opened  eComplaints (www.ecomplaints.com). Mr. Brooks hopes that his service will increase the odds that the e-mail messages will actually be read. At the heart of the service is a directory of about 600,000 e-mail addresses. Nine employees compiled the list by scanning Web sites with special software, by purchasing directories and by using, as Mr. Brooks put it, ''the old-fashioned way: making phone calls.''</p>

        <p>Wiley Brooks was frustrated when he wanted to complain to a restaurant chain by e-mail about an undercooked hamburger. ''It wasn't easy to get a valid e-mail address,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Out of that frustration has come TellThemNow.com (www.tellthemnow.com), a Web site that Mr. Brooks said would make it easier to send electronic complaints or compliments to corporate leaders, politicians, journalists and celebrities. TellThemNow.com is similar to some other Web sites, like the recently opened  eComplaints (www.ecomplaints.com). Mr. Brooks hopes that his service will increase the odds that the e-mail messages will actually be read. At the heart of the service is a directory of about 600,000 e-mail addresses. Nine employees compiled the list by scanning Web sites with special software, by purchasing directories and by using, as Mr. Brooks put it, ''the old-fashioned way: making phone calls.''</p>
        <p>Addresses can be found by using either the site's search engine or directories organized by category. A user composes a message on a form at the site. Before sending the note, the user must assign it to one of five categories, from ''highly positive'' to ''highly negative.''</p>
        <p>TellThemNow holds all the messages until late in the evening, when the day's messages for each recipient are bundled. The site adds a breakdown -- by percentage and number -- of the tone of the messages in the package, based on the users' self-assigned rankings. The bulk packaging and an attached mini-opinion poll give messages ''a little more voice'' than if they had arrived singly, Mr. Brooks said.</p>
        <p>During the first month and a half of the site's operation, Mr. Brooks said, politicians have tended to receive an even number of positive and negative messages. By contrast, about 70 percent of celebrity messages are ''very positive,'' leading Mr. Brooks to speculate that they are fan mail. He added that the company did not examine the contents of any message.</p>
        <p>But what are the odds that Britney Spears will actually read your e-mail note if it is sent through TellThemNow? Mr. Brooks makes a modest claim: ''For the most part, it would be about the same as if you sent a snail-mail letter and you have the actual, correct address.''</p>
