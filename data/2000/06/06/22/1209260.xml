        <p>''The Tumbler table is my nod to nostalgia,'' said Ted Boerner, a San Francisco furniture designer whose other work has been inspired by Art Deco and Shaker styles. Mr. Boerner's grandmother had glass tumblers in the late 1950's. ''People have a warm feeling about those glasses,'' he said. ''They make you feel comfortable.'' Each table is made of a heat-molded acrylic base, three-quarters of an inch thick and 22 inches high. Colorful laser-cut vinyl stripes are applied on the inside. The tables, with 1-inch-thick, 22-inch-diameter tops, cost $1,850 to $2,100 at Dennis Miller Associates, 306 East 61st Street.</p>
