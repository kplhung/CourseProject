        <p>Facing mounting opposition from regulators to its $115 billion deal to acquire Sprint, WorldCom is considering selling broad swaths of Sprint's operations, including Sprint's entire long-distance unit, people close to the companies said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Negotiations continue between the company and the Justice Department, which is reviewing the deal's antitrust implications in the United States.</p>
        <p>But Mario Monti, head of the European Commission's competition ministry, now appears inclined to block the deal over concern that the combined company would have too much control over the world's long-distance telephone market as well as a stranglehold on Internet traffic in Europe.</p>
        <p>Even though the deal involves two American companies, the European Commission has the power to block it. The commission, based in Brussels, is the executive arm of the 15-nation European Union. It claims jurisdiction over any merger involving companies that do more than $200 million in business in Europe.</p>
        <p>It has been clear since the deal was announced last year that the combined company would at least have to sell Sprint's Internet business, and the Justice Department appears to have accepted that element of a deal.</p>
        <p>But the European regulators would prefer that the combined company spin off WorldCom's UUNET Internet operation, the world's No. 1 Internet carrier. WorldCom executives have said that they would rather scrap the acquisition altogether than sell UUNET.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department, meanwhile, is mainly concerned about the power a combined Sprint-WorldCom would hold over the long-distance telephone business in the United States, according to people close to the negotiations.</p>
        <p>Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom's chief executive, has long been prepared to sell Sprint's consumer long-distance operation as well as the Sprint brand. But the Justice Department appears also to want a divestiture of the Sprint unit that sells long-distance services to business customers. WorldCom was built on serving business customers.</p>
        <p>One person close to the approval discussions said yesterday that WorldCom expected its talks with the Justice Department to conclude by the beginning of next week, at the latest. Mr. Monti is to meet this week with regulators and officials in Washington.</p>
        <p>WorldCom faces particular resistance in Europe, in part because many European officials say they believe it failed to follow through properly on a pledge to spin off the MCI Communications' Internet business after Worldcom agreed to buy MCI in 1997.</p>
        <p>To win approval of that acquisition, WorldCom promised to sell MCI's Internet business to Cable and Wireless of Britain. But Cable and Wireless later complained to the European Commission that the sale was incomplete, failing to include some employees as well as some contracts. WorldCom settled the dispute privately, and the European Commission did not pursue the issue. But the affair left a bad taste with regulators.</p>
        <p>''Once burned, twice shy,'' said Maurits Dolmans, an antitrust lawyer in Brussels for Cleary, Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton. ''This time the commission is going to make very, very sure that any spinoff of Sprint's Internet business is carried out quickly, fully, completely and will be entirely enforceable.''</p>
        <p>Under the European Commission's rules, the case must be decided by July 5.</p>
        <p>But the European and United States regulators are almost sure to coordinate their demands.</p>
        <p>So perhaps in recognition of the inevitable, WorldCom is now considering a plan to sell Sprint's entire long-distance business, in addition to Sprint's Internet operation. Such a plan would almost surely appease the regulators but would skew the financial plan that underpinned the acquisition in the first place.</p>
        <p>The cornerstone of the deal is Sprint's wireless telephone operation, one of the biggest in the United States. Neither WorldCom nor the old MCI owned a significant wireless network, and WorldCom hopes to generate a lot more revenue by adding Sprint's wireless offerings to its portfolio.</p>
        <p>But while Sprint's wireless unit is growing quickly, it remains highly unprofitable. Last year, it lost $2.5 billion on $3.2 billion in revenue.</p>
        <p>For investors, the main attraction of WorldCom's stock has long been its robust growth in per-share earnings. With the exception of its acquisition of the Wiltel communications network a few years ago, WorldCom has shied away from acquisitions that would dilute its per-share earnings.</p>
        <p>Sprint's wireless unit trades as a ''tracking stock,'' which helps isolate its losses from the financial results of the parent company. But in deciding to pay $115 billion for Sprint,  WorldCom was counting on billions of dollars of cost savings from combining the Sprint and WorldCom long-distance operations.</p>
        <p>But if WorldCom is forced to sell  Sprint's long-distance operation, it will not be able to realize those savings, throwing into question the financial structure of the original deal.</p>
        <p>One way out of this quandary would be to sell Sprint's long-distance unit to another company that could generate similar cost savings. But if the Sprint long-distance unit were sold to, say, a foreign company or a Bell local carrier, the cost savings that could be realized would be far smaller.</p>
        <p>In that case, unless it could renegotiate the deal with Sprint, WorldCom  would effectively end up paying a lot more than it had planned for Sprint's wireless operation. That raises the prospect that selling Sprint's long-distance business in exchange for regulatory approval would end up a Pyrrhic victory.</p>
