        <p>The accused killer has a toy fire truck in his closet. A sixth-grade photograph, signed ''To Grandma'' but never mailed, rests on a desk beside a certificate that reads ''Most Improved in Spanish'' and algebra homework done in No. 2 pencil. He has mastered polynomials, the homework shows, but he signed the paper ''Nate Wuz Here.''</p>
        <p>Nathaniel Brazill, 13, left his room that way on May 26, the last day of classes before summer vacation at Lake Worth Middle School, the day he took a stolen gun to school and pointed it at the face of his English teacher.</p>
        <p>Palm Beach County prosecutors, who say he shot Barry Grunow to death because the teacher would not let him into a classroom to say goodbye to two girls, charged Nathaniel, an honors student and tuba player,  as an adult with first-degree murder.</p>
        <p>In his room in a stark triplex on H Street, his mother, Polly Powell, wondered how anyone could call her son an adult when it seems like only yesterday that the boy, whom everyone calls Nate, was playing in the dirt with a yellow Tonka truck.</p>
        <p>But while a mother's love is expected to be blind, others in this neighborhood ask the same thing, how a seemingly good and promising boy, who was never in trouble, could do this. It happened, his mother says, because he is still a boy.</p>
        <p>''He is not a man,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't shave. He can't drive a car, or go into the service. He can't buy cigarettes or beer, or a lottery ticket. He's a child,'' she said, and like any other he is impulsive, eager to impress friends, ignorant of the long-term consequences of things he does.</p>
        <p>''I want my boy back,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Nate, the carrier of his mother's dream that he would break loose from her neighborhood of tiny houses and rumbling freight trains, is charged with a murder that demands harsh punishment at an age that would seem to beg for some leniency, but in a state where there is no middle ground.</p>
        <p>He is charged as an adult, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, rather than as a juvenile, which might have ended in his being remanded to a youth detention center for a few years. Whether such a charge is appropriate is the same question being asked in other states as a nightmare epidemic of school shootings spread across the country, as courts decide how to punish killers too young to see an R-rated movie.</p>
        <p>''It's the policy in this office,'' and in the state, for youths charged in such violent felonies, said Michael Edmondson, executive assistant to Barry Krischer, the Palm Beach County state attorney. ''There is no selective application of that policy. That way you don't discriminate.''</p>
        <p>Last week, a grand jury in Palm Beach County took barely 15 minutes to indict Nate on a charge of first-degree murder. He is being held in a special ward reserved for teenagers in the county jail.</p>
        <p>''I know he did wrong, I know he should be punished,'' said Mrs. Powell, who believes the whole thing was an accident, that the gun just went off. ''But punish him as a juvenile. If any parent tells you different, what they'd do if it was them, they're telling a lie.''</p>
        <p>The case has caused some Florida lawmakers to consider legislation to create some middle ground. For now, defendants like Nate can only be sentenced to hard time in a state prison for adults, perhaps for the rest of their lives. But some lawmakers are considering legislation that would allow judges to take age into consideration, perhaps allowing younger offenders to serve time in a juvenile center and then in a state prison -- rather than locking them away in a state prison.</p>
        <p>''There might be some choice in the middle,'' said Ron Klein, a state senator from Boca Raton, who is drafting a bill that would allow the courts to consider all aspects of the case, including an offender's potential for reform.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grunow's family has been quiet since the killing, saying only, in a statement, that they trust in the law.</p>
        <p>Nate's lawyers must convince a judge and jury that he did not mean to kill the respected 35-year-old teacher, who left a wife, a 5-year-old son and infant daughter. Nate's best defense seems to be his past.</p>
        <p>''I've been representing jerks for 20 years,'' said Bob Udell, a lawyer from nearby Stuart who is representing Nate. ''They were bad people and they'd cut your throat in a second. This isn't that. This is payback for 20 years of jerks. This is a good kid.''</p>
        <p>This spring, as teachers at Lake Worth Middle School selected students for offices for the coming year, they selected Nate as a ''mediator,'' a student who could be relied on to help others resolve confrontation without violence.</p>
        <p>The teacher who sponsored him was Mr. Grunow.</p>
        <p>Nate grew up in a neighborhood where young boys were sometimes expected to fight. The neighborhood, stucco duplexes and small concrete houses squeezed between the railroad tracks and a nondescript stretch of U.S. 1, trembles faintly under freight cars loaded with crushed limestone. This part of Lake Worth, south of Palm Beach, was once an enclave for blacks who drifted down from the South, but now many people speak Spanish or Haitian Creole.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, Mrs. Powell planned on his life being much better, much easier than hers, though raising him was less than ideal. Mrs. Powell, an assistant food services director for a retirement home, left Nate's father, But people here say she that she spent much of what she made on him, that she was a good mother, if overly protective. She is full of stories, like the one about his first haircut, how he touched his head and looked up at her with his eyes really big and said, ''Put it back.'' In third grade, ''he got straight A's,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She gave him good toys -- not those plastic things that break in a week -- and later bought a $1,700 computer for schoolwork. ''He had more than most people here,'' said Mrs. Powell, who also has a 2-year-old daughter, Ebony.</p>
        <p>She did not allow him to speak in street slang. She saw, around her, boys who pretended to be gangsters, who dressed like gangsters, then one day vanished into the violence. Her son was a junior usher who went to Bible study on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''He was the kid you hope for,'' said Sharon Odums, who has known Mrs. Powell since elementary school.</p>
        <p>Some students seemed to resent him, because he seemed so goody-goody. ''People would make fun of him,'' said Shikeria Knowles, 13, a classmate of Nate since third grade. ''They would pick on him, and he would just ignore them. He wouldn't do a thing. He had brains.''</p>
        <p>He was popular with the smart kids. ''He was always helping people with homework,'' Shikeria said. When he drew a role as a woman in a play in Mr. Grunow's class, he did it good-naturedly, and students applauded.</p>
        <p>Frank Bermudez, the band and chorus director at the school, said Nate got an A in band. ''But I really don't remember when he didn't,'' Mr. Bermudez added. ''He switched from trumpet to tuba to help out our band. He liked coming to practice. I had to throw him out of the room at times, because he was so dedicated.''</p>
        <p>He played video games where people blew up people and watched movies of death and mayhem, but no more than anyone else, and never acted any of it out, friends said.</p>
        <p>The pivotal moment in Nate's life may have come the week before the shooting. While visiting the home of a relative, he saw a tiny Raven .25-caliber gun. Nate took it.</p>
        <p>''People ask what happened,'' said his mother. ''Life happened.'' The man who had the gun bought it because he lives in a neighborhood where, sometimes, a gun makes people feel more safe. Her son saw it and, fascinated as boys are with guns, took it, probably to show his friends, she said.</p>
        <p>On the last day of class, a teacher, not Mr. Grunow, saw Nate in a water balloon fight, and sent him home. A classmate told the police that Nate said he would seek revenge, that ''I'll be all over the news.''</p>
        <p>He went home and got the gun, and came back just before the final bell. He did not seek out the teacher who expelled him but went instead to Mr. Grunow's class and asked to say goodbye to two girls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grunow told him no. As the two stood in the hallway, Nate pulled his gun, pointed it into Mr. Grunow's face and shot him, the police say.</p>
        <p>When another teacher came up to him, he wheeled and pointed it at that teacher, but did not shoot or the gun did not fire, the police said. Nate ran, but flagged down a police car a few minutes later and turned himself in.</p>
        <p>''We expect things like this,'' said Mr. Bermudez. ''We don't, from a kid like this.''</p>
        <p>The why of it haunts people here. ''I think it was his chance to scare people,'' to show he was more than a nice boy, Shikeria said. ''I think he kept it all inside, for too long.''</p>
        <p>Larry Balfour, a counselor at the Osborne Community Center near Nate's neighborhood, said, ''No one ever had anything bad to say about him.''</p>
        <p>Maybe that was it, that he wanted more attention than an honor roll could give, more than playing tuba on a 50-yard line, classmates said. Nate was, in the end, too good to be true. But his mother says no, he was good, and will be good again. ''My baby is going to be somebody,'' she said.</p>
