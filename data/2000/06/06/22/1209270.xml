        <p>FISHS EDDY  60 Mercer Street</p>
        <p>WITH three stores in Manhattan and one in Southampton, Fishs Eddy is well known for its vintage tableware and reproductions. Its latest outpost opened last week in SoHo. The owners, Julie Gaines and David Lenovitz, search out stashes of vintage wares while encouraging maufacturers to produce new, retro-looking patterns. Their inventory of classic Green Band cafeteria dinnerware, above, is a melange of both old and new. The pattern, started in the 1920's, is still made today by Syracuse China, but many of the old shapes and sizes are no longer in production. Vintage celery plates, creamers, custard cups and demitasse cups are $12 to $18. New dinner plates are $9.95. Vintage 1960's green pressed-glass pitchers, right, are $30.</p>
