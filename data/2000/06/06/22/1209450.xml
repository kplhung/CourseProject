        <p>Erick Barkley has signed with the player agent whose relationship with Barkley last winter was part of the focus of a National Collegiate Athletic Association investigation.</p>
        <p>The National Basketball Players Association and representatives of St. John's confirmed that the agent, Andy Miller, would represent Barkley, the former St. John's point guard who has impressed N.B.A. teams with his play in workouts.</p>
        <p>Barkley appears to be headed anywhere from the middle to late in the first round of next Wednesday's draft. He has been rated in a group that includes his high school teammate, Hofstra's Speedy Claxton; Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves; Michigan's Jamal Crawford; and Missouri's Keyon Dooling.</p>
        <p>The Orlando Magic, which holds three lottery picks, including No. 13 over all, has indicated that it will take a point guard, and the Detroit Pistons are interested in a point guard at No. 14.</p>
        <p>Barkley, who declared for the draft after his sophomore season, was suspended twice by the N.C.A.A. last season while it investigated what it believed were improper gifts given to Barkley. Miller accompanied Barkley to a meeting earlier this year with St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis in which Barkley told the coach of his intention to turn pro.</p>
        <p>Miller, who did not return a call to his office yesterday, is facing criminal charges in Florida because he allegedly made numerous phone calls to the University of Florida's Mike Miller while not being registered in the state. Mike Miller has since entered the draft and is represented by another agent.</p>
        <p>If convicted of a felony, Andy Miller would face automatic suspension by the players association.</p>
        <p>Miller is also the subject of a lawsuit brought by another agent, Eric Fleisher, who alleged that Miller, who worked for him, stole his clients.</p>

        <p>ORDERLY CELEBRATION FOR LAKERS: Where stores were looted and police cars burned two days before, a quarter-million Los Angeles Lakers fans hailed the new N.B.A. champions yesterday in an adoring sea of purple and gold.</p>
        <p>They heard speeches from the mayor, promises of more titles and a pledge from their biggest star to try to undo some of the damage from Monday night's post-victory violence.</p>
        <p>The other night after the game, a couple of bad things happened, a couple of people trashed two police cars, Shaquille O'Neal said. So on behalf of the Lakers and Phil Jackson, we're going to get them two new police cars.</p>
        <p>The fans roared, and said the outbreaks of crime after the title clincher seemed far away. I had no reservations at all about coming out today, said Dorothy Rhan, a member of the crowd that stretched nine blocks to the Lakers' home at the Staples Center.</p>
        <p>A mob looted stores, smashed windows and torched police cars and news vans outside the arena after the Lakers defeated the Indiana Pacers, 116-111, to win the championship in six games.</p>

        <p>WILKENS TAKES THE HELM: Lenny Wilkens never stopped smiling yesterday as he ticked off the reasons why, at 62, the top-winning coach in N.B.A. history was joining a Canadian franchise that recently seemed in disarray.</p>
        <p>He cited an organization that ''exudes class,'' a great city, Vince Carter, and the chance for something new with a team coming off its first playoff appearance. Wilkens signed a reported four-year, $20 million deal to become the fourth head coach in Raptors' history.</p>

        <p>L.S.U. SOPHOMORE ENTERS DRAFT: Stromile Swift knew what to do once he started hearing how highly N.B.A. teams regard him. The Louisiana State forward announced yesterday that he would skip his last two years of college and make himself available for next week's draft.</p>
        <p>As a sophomore, the 6-foot-9-inch Swift averaged 16.2 points, 8.2 rebounds and nearly 3 blocks to help L.S.U. win the Southeastern Conference regular season co-championship.</p>
