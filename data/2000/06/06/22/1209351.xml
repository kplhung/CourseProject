        <p>Of course there is a difference playing the Senior Tour for Tom Watson, who, despite his Huck Finn face, is 50 years old. There's no Tiger Woods to torment the seniors.</p>
        <p>Watson, who earned 34 PGA Tour victories, including five British Opens, and the right to be spoken of in the same sentence with Nicklaus and Palmer and Trevino and Player, is in his first season as a senior player. He has finished second four times, including a pair of playoffs. He talks of playing against Tom Kite and Lanny Wadkins and Hale Irwin among the seniors.</p>
        <p>Last Sunday, though, he was in the United States Open. ''I finished 24 strokes back,'' he said ruefully but admiringly of Woods.</p>
        <p>Watson did not carry over that distress, though. He shot a cool 69 today while paired with the Jets' Vinny Testaverde (who fired a 79, including a one-over-par 37 on the back nine) in the player-pro two-day tourney that is a prelude to the Cadillac N.F.L. Classic, a Senior PGA Tour event that begins Friday. The 26 football players with the best scores get to tee off with the pros that day.</p>
        <p>Watson was free of serious injury on the PGA Tour. But no sooner did he become a senior player than he fractured his heel after jumping over a fence. He wore a brace, which affected his walk, threw out his pelvis and strained his back. Now he is learning to live with the discomfort.</p>
        <p>What it is like to be a senior golfer?</p>
        <p>''It's a very different experience,'' Watson said. ''The regular tour has Tiger. The Senior Tour three rounds. There's no cut. It changes your strategy, but it's fun to go out and have a no-cut.''</p>
        <p>He entered the Senior Tour with hopes of recapturing some lost magic. He admitted he cannot hit the ball as far or as straight as he did five years ago. But his father died this year, and then he injured his heel.</p>
        <p>''I haven't lost that intensity,'' Watson said. ''I don't think it's conceited to say there's only one guy I can't compete with. Also, I use the cart a lot now.''</p>
        <p>That one guy is Woods. Watson, just out of Stanford, turned pro in 1971 and went up against Jack Nicklaus back then, and they clashed repeatedly on the course through the next two decades.</p>
        <p>''What Tiger is doing is reminiscent of Jack's domination of the tour,'' Watson said. ''No one dominated like Jack, at least in my lifetime. But Tiger's got Jack beat in the short game, at least.''</p>
        <p>Now Watson gets another chance to face Woods. The only regular tour events Watson plans to compete in are the majors, so the next stop will be St. Andrews and the British Open next month.</p>
        <p>''With no wind,'' Watson said, ''he should be 20 under par.''</p>
        <p>Testaverde's New Role</p>
        <p>Vinny Testaverde has thought long and hard about the changes on the Jets and what he must do this season. In their round today, Tom Watson asked him if much had happened on the Jets.</p>
        <p>''More than to any other club,'' Testaverde replied.</p>
        <p>Testaverde said later in an interview that he realized that as quarterback he would have to take some personal coaching responsibilities on himself. He cited the loss of three mainstays of the offense: Keyshawn Johnson, the Pro Bowl wide receiver traded to Tampa Bay; Jumbo Elliott, the left tackle, who retired; and Leon Johnson, the versatile third-down back, whose knee injury may end his career.</p>
        <p>In addition to a new head coach in Al Groh, who replaced Bill Parcells, there is also a new offensive coordinator, with Dan Henning taking over for Charlie Weis.</p>
        <p>''No question, I'll be doing a lot of coaching,'' Testaverde said. ''I'm at the stage where I understand things. My job as a quarterback will be bigger than it was when I came here in '98.''</p>
        <p>Parcells, the Author</p>
        <p>Bill Parcells is writing a book, ''The Final Season,'' in collaboration with Will McDonough, a Boston Globe columnist and NBC analyst. . . . Al Del Greco, the Tennessee Titans kicker, whom Testaverde describes as ''the Tiger Woods of N.F.L. golf,'' was the early leader with a 74, but was surpassed by the former Yale star fullback Chris Hetherington of Carolina, who shot a 70.</p>
