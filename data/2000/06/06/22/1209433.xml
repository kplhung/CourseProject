        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The letter about Uninterruptible Power Supplies (''Surge Protection,'' Incoming, June 15) was correct to assert that the devices offer higher-quality surge protection than a simple power strip. Some even include an offer to replace any equipment damaged by lightning while attached to the U.P.S.</p>
        <p>But the U.P.S. device's battery rarely comes into play for surge protection; most devices can lower the voltage to a safe level rather than switching to battery power. The advantage of a U.P.S. device is that when voltage drops below usable levels, as in a brownout or blackout, your computer will remain running for a few minutes. With some devices, that period allows files to be saved automatically before the computer loses power. My U.P.S. device has been working beautifully for more than a year and has protected my computer from many a power disruption since I bought it.</p>
