        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>IRAN, EGYPT: DIRECT TALKS  Presaging a possible warming of relations between two mutually suspicious nations, the presidents of Egypt and Iran spoke by telephone in what may be the first direct top-level contact since their countries broke off ties after Egypt's peace treaty with Israel in 1979. The occasion for the conversation was Iran's bid to join the so-called G15 group of developing nations, which ended a two-day meeting in Cairo.</p>

        <p>IRAN: 2 WOMEN FREED  Two Iranian women who were jailed in May after attending a Berlin seminar on democracy were released after posting about $60,000 each in bail. Mehrangiz Kar and Shahla Lahiji, women's rights figures who have been denounced by religious conservatives, are charged with endangering Iran's security. Four others arrested after attending the Berlin conference remain in prison.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: CRISIS MOVE  The leftist Meretz Party paved the way for a resolution to Prime Minister Ehud Barak's coalition crisis. Meretz said it would stay in the coalition to support Mr. Barak's peace moves, but that its three ministers, including Education Minister Yossi Sarid, left, would give up their cabinet posts. That should help bring back the linchpin Shas Party, which has been in a feud with Mr. Sarid and quit the government, with resignations that do not take effect until today.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: SETTLER TALKS  Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he had decided to open a ''continuous dialogue'' with settlers, who have been protesting regularly outside his residence and office. His office said he had told his ministers and peace negotiators to visit settlements and listen to settlers' concerns.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: BARGAINING CHIPS  Parliament passed a preliminary bill enabling Israel to imprison ''combatants not entitled to prisoner-of-war status.'' The bill is meant to enable Israel to continue holding two Lebanese militants seized as bargaining chips for missing Israeli soldiers. After a High Court ruling outlawed the practice the government sought to create a legal justification for their detention.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: BLAST HURTS 2  An explosion hurt  two men in a Catholic area of Belfast, but the cause of the blast was not immediately clear. The Royal Ulster Constabulary said it was not yet known whether the explosion was caused by a gas leak or was a political bombing.</p>

        <p>BOSNIA: U.N. MISSION EXTENDED  The Security Council extended for one year a Bosnia mission that includes a 1,600-member international police force sent to create a multiethnic local force from Muslims, Serbs and Bosnian Croats. Russia abstained in protest at the exclusion of Yugoslavia from a conference in Brussels on Bosnia's future. China also spoke against the exclusion of President Slobodan Milosevic's government from the conference, but voted for the mission's extension.</p>

        <p>COLOMBIA: RIGHTISTS ADMIT KIDNAPPING  The leader of the main right-wing paramilitary group has admitted ordering the kidnapping of Guillermo Valencia, a member of Congress who is the brother of one of the government's chief negotiators in peace talks with leftist guerrillas. Carlos Castano said the abduction was necessary ''to stop the continuing and progressive handover of the country to the guerrillas.''</p>

        <p>GUATEMALA: PRESIDENT'S FAMILY FLEES  President Alfonso Portillo's mother and sister, along with other family members, have left the country out of fear of being targets for a kidnapping ring. Mr. Portillo's mother, sister, son-in-law and two nephews left for Canada. Mr. Portillo said he received information that a kidnapping ring was going after his family after he refused to grant clemency for two of its members facing the death sentence.</p>

        <p>MALAYSIA: ANWAR TRIAL ADJOURNED  After a year of hearings, a judge adjourned the trial of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and ordered lawyers to produce written summations in advance of a verdict. Mr. Anwar, who is already serving a six-year sentence for corruption, faces a sentence of up to 20 years in  the current case, in which he is accused of sexual misconduct.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: NEW KILLINGS  At least nine people were reported killed as fighting continued in the remote Spice Islands after a massacre on the island of Halmahera in which as many as 160 people were killed. Thousands have died in 18 months of fighting between Christians and Muslims.</p>

        <p>ZIMBABWE: FOREIGNERS BARRED  The government refused to accredit dozens of foreigners to observe this weekend's voting in parliamentary elections. They included observers from the National Democratic Institute, an American organization, which was assailed by the government for reporting that political violence had impaired prospects for free and fair elections. Observers from the European Union, the Commonwealth, the Organization of African Unity and southern Africa will monitor the vote.</p>

        <p>SUDAN: AMNESTY ISSUED  President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, seeking to end his country's 17-year civil war, has granted a general amnesty to anyone who committed an act of rebellion since he seized power in 1989. The official Sudanese news agency reported that Mr. Bashir had decreed an ''unconditional general amnesty'' to any Sudanese, civilian or military, who committed an act of rebellion between June 30, 1989, and last Tuesday.</p>
