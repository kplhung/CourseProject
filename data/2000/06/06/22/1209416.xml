        <p>A spacecraft orbiting Mars has sighted grooved surface features suggesting a relatively recent water flow on the planet, a finding that could redirect efforts to find evidence of past or present life there, experts said today.</p>
        <p>NASA's Mars Global Surveyor, which has been conducting photographic surveys of the planet for more than two years, has spotted evidence of liquid water at, or near, the surface that could have flowed a few hundreds or thousands of years ago, a billion years later than previous estimates, the experts said.</p>
        <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration scheduled a news conference for Thursday to discuss the findings after a day of speculation about the discovery in the news media. A paper describing the observations is to be published next week in the journal Science, but the journal's editors decided to release the information on Thursday because of the interest in the findings.</p>
        <p>Neither NASA nor the authors of the report, including Dr. Michael C. Malin and Dr. Ken Edgett of Malin Space Science Systems of San Diego, would disclose details of the findings. But people familiar with the report said high resolution pictures from Global Surveyor clearly show channels and grooves on the steep, inside walls of craters that indicate the downward flow of liquid water.</p>
        <p>These surface features appear to be evidence of water in the upper crust of Mars that has seeped through and run down the channels, said two experts familiar with the report who spoke on the condition that they not be named. Contrary to speculation about the findings, there is no clear evidence of standing pools of water or gushing springs on Mars, they said.</p>
        <p>''The current climate of Mars would cause surface water to instantly freeze and vaporize into the atmosphere,'' one expert said.</p>
        <p>Water is crucial to plans for exploring Mars with robot spacecraft to find evidence of life, and for possible visits by humans. The United States has ambitious Mars exploration plans that focus on finding water. Those plans are being revised after the failure of two spacecrafts  last year.</p>
        <p>Dr. Edward J. Weiler, NASA's chief scientist, said future orbiting and surface craft would search for water and the life it can sustain. ''To find life on Mars, you have to follow the water,'' Dr. Weiler has said. ''Without water, there was no life as we know it in the past, and there is no life now. It's all about the water.''</p>
        <p>Future spacecraft would be directed to areas where there is a high probability of finding water. Data from orbiters and landing craft would help researchers home in on those areas.</p>
        <p>Water on Mars would also make human visits more likely and economical, experts said, because astronauts could drink it, and it could be broken down into oxygen to breathe and hydrogen to fuel rockets and generators.</p>
        <p>Water has been detected on Mars in the form of ice trapped at the poles, but until now no evidence of it had been seen elsewhere. Because of the planet's extreme temperatures, with average surface temperatures of minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and an atmospheric pressure less than 1 percent that of Earth's, liquid water would not exist long on the surface before breaking down in the thin air and drifting into space.</p>
        <p>But there is ample evidence of  flowing water long ago on the planet, including channels and canyons formed by flowing rivers millions of years ago and indications of upswelling ground waters. And last year, scientists at Brown University said that they found evidence in Global Surveyor pictures, which are more than 20 times more detailed than any previous photographs, of a giant ocean that once existed in the northern lowlands.</p>
        <p>An intriguing aspect of the newest findings is the possibility of water near the surface, instead of miles below as some have theorized. If water is a few feet below the surface, as early characterizations of the new data suggest, landing crafts could drill down to reach it, experts said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Victor R. Baker, a hydrology expert and planetary scientist at the University of Arizona, said that if there was evidence of active water seepage in the new data, it would have wide implications. Dr. Baker, who had not seen the report, said that if water still flowed on Mars and escaped to the surface, it would need an underground heat source to keep it thawed and provide the energy necessary to force it to the surface. So far, no evidence of active volcanic or thermal activity has been found on the planet, he noted.</p>
        <p>If water was flowing on Mars, he said, it would produce a cloud of vapor, as it dissipated under current surface conditions, that spacecraft instruments should be able to detect from orbit. ''It should be fairly easy to confirm if there is major seepage going on now,'' Dr. Baker said.</p>
