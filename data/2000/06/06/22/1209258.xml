        <p>Quiz: The Phantom is a molded plastic 1. chair, 2. bench, 3. stool, 4. table. Answer: It's whatever you want it to be. It was one of the last designs by Verner Panton of Switzerland, who died in 1998. The lightweight molded plastic piece, produced in Denmark, was introduced in this country at last month's International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York. Meant to be flexible furniture for young people, it can be a seat for one person, turned upside-down to accommodate two or placed on its side and used as a table. Put a group of Phantoms together, and you have a sofa. The quirky Phantom is available in blue, black, orange, pink, white and purple and costs $375. At Totem, 71 Franklin Street (Broadway).</p>
