        <p>In a grudging move to rein in soaring oil prices, ministers at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided today to increase their production limits by about 708,000 barrels a day, or 2.5 percent, beginning July 1.</p>
        <p>The increase, OPEC's second in three months, is slightly higher than had been expected. But analysts said it remained too modest to bring down gasoline prices that have reached more than $2 a gallon in some parts of the United States.</p>

        <p>In a grudging move to rein in soaring oil prices, ministers at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided today to increase their production limits by about 708,000 barrels a day, or 2.5 percent, beginning July 1.</p>
        <p>The increase, OPEC's second in three months, is slightly higher than had been expected. But analysts said it remained too modest to bring down gasoline prices that have reached more than $2 a gallon in some parts of the United States.</p>
        <p>Given that member countries are already overshooting their official production quotas, analysts said that today's move largely amounts to a ratification of existing practices.</p>
        <p>As a practical matter, any increased production in crude oil will take at least two months to work its way through the refining system and will not reach gasoline pumps until after the summer driving season is largely over.</p>
        <p>''They are officializing what they are already producing,'' said Roger Diwan, an analyst at the Petroleum Finance Corporation, an industry consulting firm in Washington. ''It's the minimum that could have been done.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, oil ministers meeting here in Vienna went out of their way to place much of the blame for high gasoline prices on regulations and refining problems in the United States as well as extremely high gasoline taxes across much of Europe.</p>
        <p>''People in consuming countries point their finger at OPEC,'' complained Rilwanu Lukman, the organization's secretary general. ''These people should tackle their own countries.''</p>
        <p>But many oil ministers have themselves been baffled by the extent to which prices have remained high. One senior official here complained that buying and selling in the petroleum markets has caused unjustifiable price swings from as low as $24 to as high as $33 since OPEC raised production at the end of March.</p>
        <p>Production has increased more than two million barrels a day since the end of March, yet crude oil prices have rebounded and inventories are still at their lowest levels in years.</p>
        <p>For all their caution, oil ministers meeting here displayed far more solidarity than they did three months ago, when Iran angrily rebelled against Saudi Arabian pressure to raise production by about 7 percent, or a total of 1.7 million barrels a day.</p>
        <p>Today, Iran signed on without any objections to the new increase while also formally accepting the last one as well. By avoiding a replay of the bitter rift in March, the OPEC ministers, who control about 40 percent of the global supply of oil, easily reached a consensus in one day.</p>
        <p>''Today, everybody I think is of the opinion that an increase was necessary,'' said Khelil Chakib, Algeria's oil minister, who predicted that the price of crude oil would soon decline from more than $30 a barrel to less than $28.</p>
        <p>''The question was how big the increase should be,'' Mr. Chakib added. ''I think this is about the right volume because we have got to consider manufacturers, the supply-demand behavior and the growth of world consumption.''</p>
        <p>That attitude reflects a significant change in the mindset within OPEC.  As recently as three months ago, many producer countries were still terrified that any increase in production would lead to a catastrophic decline in prices similar to one in 1998, when oil fell to the $10-a-barrel level at one point.</p>
        <p>But when oil prices jumped back to more than $30 a barrel after the last production increase, exporting countries became increasingly more confident.</p>
        <p>At the same time, more countries now agree with Saudi Arabian leaders that current prices are too high to be stable and would over time cause economic slowdowns in consuming countries that could hurt OPEC members by lowering global demand for their oil.</p>
        <p>As one official from a non-OPEC producing country remarked today:  ''When the price of crude on the market is $33, everybody can afford to be friends.''</p>
        <p>World oil markets brushed off the production increase announced today, sending prices up. Crude oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped about 2 percent,  or 72 cents, to $31.37 a barrel.</p>
        <p>OPEC ministers essentially conceded today that they had given up their plan for an ''automatic'' adjustment if oil prices ranged outside a band of $22 to $28 a barrel.</p>
        <p>Member countries had agreed to the band in March, but when the 20-day average price of oil exceeded $28 a barrel two weeks ago, the organization did not impose any increase.</p>
        <p>''Forget about bands,'' Mr. Lukman told reporters after the oil ministers adjourned their meeting. "Focus on the fact that OPEC wants a price of around $25 a barrel.''</p>
        <p>OPEC's influence on the global supply of oil is immense. It plays a crucial role as a swing producer that can pump or withhold additional oil. All other producers are already pumping at maximum capacity.</p>
        <p>Indeed, many OPEC members are already at or near their own maximum capacity. But the countries that still have extra capacity are among its biggest producers: Saudi Arabia, which pumps about 8 million barrels a day; Kuwait, which pumps about 2 million barrels; and the United Arab Emirates, which pumps about 2.2 million barrels.</p>
        <p>Iran, which produces about 3.6 million barrels a day, is believed to be near maximum capacity. But Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, insisted this evening that his country could meet its new quotas.</p>
        <p>''We have enough capacity,'' Mr. Sangeneh said at the start of the minister's meeting. ''We can comply fully with our commitments within OPEC.''</p>
        <p>A few important non-OPEC producers, mainly Mexico and Norway, are expected to increase production as well. Both countries copied the production cuts that OPEC members adopted in March 1999, which helped prices more than triple to a high of $34, the highest in nearly a decade.</p>
        <p>Further non-OPEC production could add another 300,000 barrels of oil a day, bringing the total supply of new oil to 600,000 or 700,000 barrels a day.</p>
        <p>In Washington, the Clinton administration greeted OPEC's decision with cautious praise. The White House has kept a decidedly low profile in the last few weeks, in sharp contrast to the relentless and very public lobbying conducted by Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson before OPEC's meeting in March.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson's lobbying campaign, which included telephone calls to OPEC ministers while they were meeting in Vienna, irritated many countries and provoked especially loud denunciations from Iran about ''external pressure.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson expressed a measured endorsement of OPEC's decision today, calling it ''a positive, though modest step that we hope will lead to more stable oil markets and lower oil prices at the pump.''</p>
        <p>Gary N. Ross, head of PIRA Energy, an energy consulting firm in New York, was more skeptical and predicted that today's move would do little to minimize American motorist anger, particularly in the Midwest where gasoline prices have surpassed $2 a gallon.</p>
        <p>''World demand will go up by 1.5 million barrels a day in the third quarter compared to the second quarter,'' Mr. Ross predicted here today. ''So we are not going to get the supply to increase stock-building. This is not going to make Al Gore or the U.S. government very happy.''</p>
