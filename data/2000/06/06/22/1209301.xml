        <p>After decades as one of the most ambitious songwriters alive, Ruben Blades continues to push himself. Unlike the current wave of Latin pop singers reaching for a Pan-American common denominator of dance and romance, Mr. Blades wants to reach both head and hips. His lyrics can be character studies, social comments or cinematic vignettes; his music combines elements from all over the hemisphere, seeking what he calls ''globalization without victims.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blades brought his new band, Editus, to his JVC Jazz Festival concert at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday night. Editus is a large group of classically trained musicians from Costa Rica with a core trio of violin, guitar and percussion. The players dip into styles from across the hemisphere. Although the set was shortened by Carnegie Hall's curfew, the music hopscotched from Argentina to New York to Havana to Mr. Blades's native Panama.</p>

        <p>After decades as one of the most ambitious songwriters alive, Ruben Blades continues to push himself. Unlike the current wave of Latin pop singers reaching for a Pan-American common denominator of dance and romance, Mr. Blades wants to reach both head and hips. His lyrics can be character studies, social comments or cinematic vignettes; his music combines elements from all over the hemisphere, seeking what he calls ''globalization without victims.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blades brought his new band, Editus, to his JVC Jazz Festival concert at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday night. Editus is a large group of classically trained musicians from Costa Rica with a core trio of violin, guitar and percussion. The players dip into styles from across the hemisphere. Although the set was shortened by Carnegie Hall's curfew, the music hopscotched from Argentina to New York to Havana to Mr. Blades's native Panama.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blades sang about lovers and gangsters, going back to his groundbreaking ''Pedro Navaja,'' a barrio update of ''Mack the Knife,'' and including two songs from his 1999 album with Editus, ''Tiempos'' (Sony Discos). One, ''Dia a Dia,'' is a repentant love song that argues, ''Anyone who never sinned has never lived.'' The other, ''Sicarios,'' coolly observes two assassins at work; it started with a rhythm from northeastern Brazil, then shifted to a Colombian cumbia, with the keyboard sounding like an accordion.</p>
        <p>But not every song was a hybrid. ''Camaleon'' was an old-fashioned Cuban-style guajira, which Mr. Blades sang in the rounded tones of a classic sonero. It was proof that Mr. Blades, for all his tinkering, knows his Afro-Cuban traditions.</p>
        <p>While battling Carnegie Hall's acoustics, Editus showed off its technique in arrangements that evolved from pristine acoustic-guitar picking to driving salsa vamps. Mr. Blades's newer songs are made for the group, but in some older ones Editus was too eager to show all it could do. Replacing the lean, kinetic arrangements of Mr. Blades's previous band, Son del Solar, Editus piled on countermelodies for violin and fidgety ornaments for keyboards and guitar. The songs began to sound studied rather than spontaneous.</p>
        <p>Orquesta Aragon, a Cuban institution founded in 1939, opened the concert with genteel, subtly propulsive dance tunes. The group is a charanga: singers backed by solo flute, violins and a rhythm section. Eduard Rubio, the flutist, was the music's gadfly, with breakneck lines, triple-tongued barrages and insistent trills.</p>
        <p>When Orquesta Aragon was founded, it played the courtly melodies of danzon. But it hasn't stood still; its set accelerated through cha-cha, son and a combination of percussion-driven rumba and easygoing guaracha, ''Guacharumba,'' from its latest album, ''La Charanga Eterna'' (Lusafrica).</p>
        <p>Inocente Alvarez stole the show with a timbales solo; hitting the drums hard, he splintered stick after stick until he started playing with a shoe in each hand. Then, as the band sang ''Agua pa ti, agua pa mi'' (''Water for you, water for me''), he ran up and down Carnegie Hall's aisles, pouring water on his head and splashing listeners along the way.</p>
