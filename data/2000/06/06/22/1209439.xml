        <p>Richie Adubato, the Liberty coach, was musing about his team's poor shooting in the second half of its last several games.</p>
        <p>Despite a furious comeback attempt in the last minute of last night's game at Madison Square Garden, the Liberty lost to Detroit, 67-63, as the demons roared to life once more.</p>
        <p>Shooting 39.7 percent for the game, the Liberty committed 21 turnovers and took only 11 free throws, converting 9. The Shock made 25 of 35 free throws.</p>
        <p>''Except for when we came back at the end, we didn't really play well enough to win the game,'' Adubato said. ''We break down on offense a lot, and we can't do that. Every time down the floor, someone makes a mistake.''</p>
        <p>Claudia Maria das Neves led all scorers with a career-high 16 points for Detroit (5-5). Tamika Whitmore scored 14 to lead the Liberty (4-6).</p>
        <p>Tari Phillips's 3-pointer brought the Liberty within 65-63 with 7.2 seconds left before Dominique Canty made two free throws for Detroit. With six seconds remaining, Phillips stepped out of bounds as she brought the ball upcourt.</p>
        <p>The Shock was called for a five-second violation trying to inbound the ball, but the Liberty's Crystal Robinson missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer.</p>
        <p>The scrambling, scrappy comeback faded like the flash from a camera, leaving a dark, brooding image in the Liberty minds.</p>
        <p>''This is very frustrating,'' said Teresa Weatherspoon, who finished with 7 points and 7 assists for the Liberty. ''I don't think anyone's been inconsistent as consistently as we have. I have no idea why. We can't get it done.''</p>
        <p>The Liberty (4-6) did not score a field goal against the Shock (5-5) for 7 minutes 40 seconds. But the Liberty went on a sparkling 10-2 run to start the second half, vaulting it to a 40-33 lead with 16:46 to go.</p>
        <p>The Shock, however, went on a 6-0 run to snatch a 47-46 lead with 8:32 left. Robinson floated in for a slow-motion jumper and converted a foul shot, to tie the score. But das Neves fired a 3-pointer to give the Shock a 3-point lead.</p>
        <p>A teetering shot by Sue Wicks hopped around the sides of the rim before falling through, bringing the Liberty within 1 with 4:39 to go. But the Shock scored the next 8 points for a 58-51 lead with 2:11 remaining.</p>
        <p>After a 10-2 run by the Shock to open the game, neither team could scrape together more than three baskets in a row as both slipped and skittered all over the court in the first half.</p>
        <p>The Shock stumbled to nine turnovers; the Liberty had 12.</p>
