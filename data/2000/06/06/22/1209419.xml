        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You gave too much attention to conspicuous consumption and too little to the drawbacks of placating our children with television and Nintendo now that cars have become ''entertainment centers'' (''Where The TV Room Meets the Road,'' June 15).</p>
        <p>Parents should question whether thousands of dollars should be spent this way. My husband and I have traveled with our daughter, now 6, since she was born. Throughout countless hours in the car, we read books together, sang songs, listened to music, played games, and learned from sights we passed. Sure it was harder than plugging her into a videotape, and her parents didn't always have ''peace and quiet,'' but if it's peace and quiet you want, having  children isn't the logical thing to do.</p>

        <p>You gave too much attention to conspicuous consumption and too little to the drawbacks of placating our children with television and Nintendo now that cars have become ''entertainment centers'' (''Where The TV Room Meets the Road,'' June 15).</p>
        <p>Parents should question whether thousands of dollars should be spent this way. My husband and I have traveled with our daughter, now 6, since she was born. Throughout countless hours in the car, we read books together, sang songs, listened to music, played games, and learned from sights we passed. Sure it was harder than plugging her into a videotape, and her parents didn't always have ''peace and quiet,'' but if it's peace and quiet you want, having  children isn't the logical thing to do.</p>
        <p>It's alarming how many parents find it easier to say ''yes'' to more television. Our society is already too addicted to television images, many of which are violent and unwholesome. Like many children, my daughter is often cranky and unsettled after watching TV. When I say ''no,'' she may complain, but she ends up reading books, engaging in fantasy play or, even more important, engaging with other human beings.</p>
        <p>Between television, videocassettes, Nintendo, the Internet and now ''fancy multizone systems'' in our vehicles, we risk becoming so zoned out that we won't remember how to interact with one another. Or care.</p>
