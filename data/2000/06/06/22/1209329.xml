        <p>Laura Schmidt took an Internet job 10 months ago packed with promise: a big raise, stocks she figured could some day be worth $5 million and the chance at early retirement. Unfortunately, her leisure time came way too soon.</p>
        <p>Three weeks ago, Ms. Schmidt received a pink slip from ThirdAge Media, a Web site for baby boomers, laid off in the Internet industry's first significant shakeout. As quickly and aggressively as they filled their cubicles last year, dozens of dot-coms across the country are unloading employees in an effort to meet a seemingly obvious goal heretofore put on indefinite hold: make a profit.</p>
        <p>The layoffs signal an end to the unbounded optimism of some dot-com employees who flocked to start-ups in hopes of developing sudden wealth, but who now say they are approaching new job offers with more caution. And the very stock market that once held the keys to new wealth may now be equally responsible not just for lowered expectations, but for lost jobs.</p>
        <p>Indeed, analysts say the reversal of fortune for many companies, and their employees, can be traced in part to the stock market turmoil on April 14. When the Nasdaq plunged that day, investors signaled they no longer would finance dot-coms that sought to grow at all costs, ignoring, at least temporarily, the concept that successful businesses take in more than they spend.</p>
        <p>While lots of Internet businesses with sound strategies and healthy finances are continuing to thrive, the challenge these days for a number of e-commerce companies is simply to keep from going broke.</p>
        <p>''Call it old fashioned, but at some point, these companies had to start making money,'' said Douglas Henton, president of Collaborative Economics, an economic advisory group in Palo Alto, Calif., who called the phenomenon a healthy shakeout in which some companies fail and others refine themselves. ''At some point, they run out of money and they have to start laying off.''</p>
        <p>Companies that have had to lay off workers include lesser-known and big-name Web sites, like the health care site drkoop.com Inc. (50 employees laid off, or 35 percent), carOrder.com Inc. (100 layoffs, or 33 percent), an insurance site called InsWeb (100 planned, or 40 percent), the home-furnishing site living.com (50, or 13 percent), the search engine Alta Vista (50, about 6 percent) and more than two dozens other sites for a total of more than 2,000 employees.</p>
        <p>And that does not include a growing number of dot-coms that have been subsumed in mergers or simply gone broke, including DEN.com, an entertainment site in Los Angeles that employed 200; APBnews.com, a New York-based crime news site with 140 workers; and toysmart.com, a Disney-backed toy retailer in Waltham, Mass., with 170 employees that shut down in May.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, even Amazon.com made layoffs, but the 150 people involved represented just 2 percent of its work force and that move preceded the market downturn that seems to be driving the latest layoff trend.</p>
        <p>Executives at many of the companies still in business say that layoffs do not suggest they are desperately low on cash, but that they must plan for a future in which new infusions of capital are not as easily obtained as they have been in the two previous years. They say they are rewriting business models that had been predicated on obtaining quick public offerings, meaning that some are being forced to cut costs by terminating  employees, who are the chief expense of many Internet enterprises.</p>
        <p>''It was really hard,'' said T. Paul Thomas, president and chief executive of TurboLinux, a Linux operating system vendor in San Francisco, which cut roughly 50 of 300 employees last month. ''The people we had to let go had been here an average of two or three months. But investors, public and private, are saying you can't just spend and spend. You have to get to profitability.''</p>
        <p>The good news, economists say, is that the human toll appears limited to individual dot-coms, that the number of employees laid off represents a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of people of the Internet work force, and that nearly all of those who lost their jobs have skills that should help them easily obtain jobs with other technology companies.</p>
        <p>''There aren't any signals the economy is in trouble,'' said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. ''The industry is doing well by any economic measure. This is a company phenomenon, not an industry-wide or economy-wide phenomenon.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, most dot-com employees seem surprisingly sanguine.</p>
        <p>''This is an auspicious time,'' said Ms. Schmidt, 33, who spent 10 months as director of brand design for Third-Age Media, which cut 35 of its 140 jobs. ''I live in San Francisco. I'm just glad it happened now rather than in two months when a lot more people will be looking for jobs.''</p>
        <p>She said she saw the layoff as an opportunity for an extended vacation before she starts her next job. But she also said she was looking at prospective employers with new scrutiny to make sure their business plan seemed viable.</p>
        <p>''I would imagine that if I want a job by the end of next week, I'd have one,'' she said. But, she added, ''I'm doing a lot more research than I did before.''</p>
        <p>Many others who have been laid off say that no sooner did they receive the news than they began interviewing again, sifting through offers, taking new jobs.</p>
        <p>But not all of those receiving a pink slip are feeling rosy about the experience. One 26-year-old woman hired in February by an entertainment dot-com said she felt the company had misled her by suggesting she could ''be retired by age 30.'' Instead, she was out of a job three months later, having lost all her stock options because she was not yet vested.</p>
        <p>In retrospect, she said the company had used her, then quickly dismissed her when it came to its financial senses, and she said she was concerned that other entrepreneurs would make similar mistakes.</p>
        <p>''People are very hopeful -- investors, employees -- and married with greed, you've got a perfect formula for a lot of shady companies,'' she said, requesting anonymity because she said she had signed an agreement not to discuss the circumstances of her departure from the company.</p>
        <p>The woman said she was being very cautious when considering new offers, hoping to avoid a repeat of the situation. And that is a theme echoed not just by others who have been laid off, but also by recruiters who are placing dot-com employees in new jobs.</p>
        <p>Jodi M. Milam, who owns Career Wave, a human resources consulting company in Chandler, Ariz., that focuses on placing Internet employees around the country, said the layoff phenomenon had become ''epidemic'' because so many companies were started without sound business plans.</p>
        <p>Ms. Milam said the companies recruited employees with the promise that the companies would soon attract a next round of private financing, or even go public. But, Ms. Milam said, the entrepreneurs either were naive about their own prospects, or misleading the hires. They also seemed, she said, to lay off employees -- even those who pulled up stakes or were lured from other good jobs -- with little compunction.</p>
        <p>''Business ethics have gone down the toilet,'' she said, adding that she wakes up with a stomachache every day because ''I'm afraid of sending people to companies'' that will go under.</p>
        <p>But the companies say the layoffs represent a bona fide realization that they must be mindful of the bottom line and of what it takes to succeed in a harsher business climate. A number of the companies said the layoffs signaled an effort to shift directions, typically away from Internet businesses that focus on selling to consumers and into ventures that sell to other businesses.</p>
        <p>An example is Alta Vista, a search engine company in Palo Alto, Calif., that in early May reduced its staff by 50 people, or about 6 percent. Though the site processes a remarkable 50 million search queries a day, the company decided that its long-term survivability rested not just on being a destination site but also in licensing its technology to businesses.</p>
        <p>''We have done a slight shift in strategic positioning following the market turmoil,'' said David Emanuel, a company spokesman.</p>
        <p>In other cases, businesses are shedding ambitious plans and renewing the narrow focus with which they began operations. InsWeb, in Redwood City, Calif., in announcing plans to lay off 40 percent of its 240 workers in the next six months, said it would return to its roots, becoming a marketplace for consumers seeking insurance, and scrap a number of other projects, according to Greg Jones, company spokesman.</p>
        <p>The new focus means the end of the line at InsWeb for Steve Foster, 43, who quit a job in Los Angeles and moved north to take a job in November as InsWeb's vice president for marketing research. At the time, he said, it was ''literally the zenith of dot-com times'' and he negotiated a healthy raise and 19,000 shares of stock.</p>
        <p>In the short term, it looked as if his gamble would pay off in a big way. The company's stock, $14 when he was recruited, jumped to $36 in January, giving him a gain in personal value ''worth a quarter of a million right off the bat.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Foster was laid off with 30 colleagues two weeks ago. The company's stock, meanwhile, has fallen to $3, making his options worthless.</p>
        <p>Still, he says he bears no ill will toward the company, which he said had treated employees well and had never misled anyone about the prospects. And as to his lost fortune -- the few brief shining moments when his stock options ballooned in value -- he seems philosophical about that, too.</p>
        <p>''I've been thinking I'll keep a single share and frame it,'' he said. ''Just to keep the memory alive.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 23, 2000, Friday  An article and chart in Business Day yesterday about recent layoffs at Internet companies misstated the status of one company, APBnews.com. Although it announced on June 5 that it was out of money and was laying off all 140 employees, it has continued operations, recently found new financing and hired back about 30 workers.</p>
        <p>In addition, the chart misstated the number of employees laid off by Salon.com. It was 13, not 19.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 30, 2000, Friday  A chart in Business Day on June 22 with an article about recent layoffs at Internet companies reversed the labels on the stock performance of two companies, Salon.com and Insweb.com. From Jan. 3 to June 21, shares of Salon.com fell to $1.375 from $4.875; Insweb.com dropped to $2.75 from $25.75.</p>
