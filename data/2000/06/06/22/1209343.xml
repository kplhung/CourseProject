        <p>Opponents of the death penalty are focusing on Texas as they try to shift the debate about capital punishment from whether it is moral and effective to whether the trial-by-jury foundation of the American judicial system itself is flawed.</p>
        <p>In the case of the convicted murderer Gary Graham, which has riveted national attention, presidential politics was added to the stakes as opponents argued that Gov. George W. Bush should exert influence for a grant of clemency. Behind the pressure on Mr. Bush is a dangerous attack on the foundations of our judicial system: on the reliability of eyewitness testimony and the weight it should be given, and on juries' decisions on the credibility of witnesses.</p>
        <p>If the death penalty activists succeed in discrediting eyewitness testimony, will witnesses still find it worth reliving crimes and possibly angering defendants' allies by telling their stories? Will women come forward when they have been assaulted? America must not retreat from the age-old notion that 12 jurors can look a witness in the eye and, after hearing contradictory evidence, appropriately weigh his or her credibility.</p>
        <p>In 1981, Bernadine Skillern witnessed the murder of Bobby Lambert, twice seeing the killer's face directly. She has never wavered from her testimony that it was Gary Graham. No alibi witnesses were offered until seven years after the crime, and the courts determined their testimony was not credible. If it had been offered at the time of the trial, the state could have introduced evidence of robberies and assaults that Mr. Graham committed during a six-day crime spree at the time of the murder.</p>
        <p>The Graham case has been reviewed by state and federal courts for 16 years. Claims ranging from ineffective counsel to factual innocence have all been rejected.</p>
        <p>Those who attack the present system cite a recent national study that found 68 percent of death penalty cases are overturned on appeal. These reversals are largely on procedural technicalities; they do not indicate the factual innocence of the accused. The same study did not find any innocent person ever being executed.</p>
        <p>The states and federal government should allocate more money for DNA testing and experts to assure every protection for the accused. But the attack on our justice system by those philosophically opposed to the death penalty should be balanced by a recognition that our system of trial by jury and judicial review is just.</p>
