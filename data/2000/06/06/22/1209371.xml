        <p>North Korea has reaffirmed its pledge to the United States to stop flight-testing its long-range missile, paving the way for talks very soon with the Clinton administration on further curbs on the missile program, a senior administration official said today.</p>
        <p>The North Korean announcement  came after the administration lifted some economic sanctions on Monday and was welcomed as a ''positive statement of their commitment,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>But the North Korean pledge did not alter the administration's resolve to move ahead with its missile defense program, which has been largely justified on the assumption that North Korea could have the ability to hit the United States with nuclear or chemical-tipped ballistic missiles by 2005, the official said.</p>
        <p>Flight-testing is only one element of North Korea's missile development and such concerns as engine-testing and improving launching  sites by the North Koreans will be addressed in the coming talks, the official said.</p>
        <p>Speaking en route to China with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the official said that in return for the reaffirmation, announced in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Wednesday, the United States would announce specific dates for the resumption of talks between North Korea and Washington.</p>
        <p>These talks could begin as soon as the end of the month, officials said. The first round of talks took place in March last year in Pyongyang.</p>
        <p>In the coming session, the United States will deal with North Korea's ''development, deployment, testing and export of missiles,'' as well as the country's nuclear program, the senior official said. One goal of the talks is to seek ''verification'' of North Korean pledges.</p>
        <p>Since the summit meeting of North and South Korean leaders last week, Pentagon officials have emphasized  that although North Korea agreed last fall to suspend the testing of the Taepodong 1 missile it fired over Japan in 1998 -- a suspension it reaffirmed on Wednesday -- the North Korean military has not suspended development of a new generation of missiles known as the Taepodong 2.</p>
        <p>A National Intelligence Estimate last year concluded that by 2005 North Korea could complete development of the Taepodong 2, a missile capable of reaching the United States with a nuclear warhead.</p>
        <p>A new estimate is being prepared for President Clinton, officials said last week, and is expected to reach similar conclusions.</p>
        <p>As Dr. Albright landed here to meet with Chinese leaders on a range of issues, her aides sought to walk a fine line between lauding the outcome of the landmark summit meeting between the two Koreas last week and keeping a lid on what Washington sees as misplaced euphoria.</p>
        <p>The officials were also anxious to make clear that the United States had its own lines of communication with North Korea, separate and apart from what went on at the summit meeting in Pyongyang.</p>
        <p>Thus the senior official, who briefed reporters on Dr. Albright's plane, said that Wednesday's statement reaffirming the moratorium of flight tests was part of a choreographed script worked out between the United States and North Korea at talks in Rome at the end of May.</p>
        <p>The agreement there, the official said, was that Mr. Clinton would formalize the easing of sanctions, the North Koreans would reconfirm their moratorium, and then the United States would move ahead with the dates of the missile talks.</p>
        <p>Behind these steps lies the overall strategy worked out by Mr. Clinton's special envoy to North Korea, former Defense Secretary William J. Perry. That strategy revolves around a finely tuned series of moves to lift sanctions as North Korea begins to freeze its nuclear arsenal and end sales of missile technology to  countries Washington suspects of sponsoring terrorism.</p>
        <p>But the three days of amiability at the Korean summit meeting surprised the administration and left officials faced with uncomfortable diplomatic pressure to ease up on its missile defense program just as the American presidential election is about to get under way.</p>
        <p>Some of Washington's NATO allies have questioned whether the North Korean missile threat was serious enough to deploy a missile defense shield that antagonizes Russia and China.</p>
        <p>Despite the administration's unchanged position on North Korea's missile capacity, Dr. Albright's aides said they noted that the tone of the statement from Pyongyang was more generous than in the past. For example, the senior official said that the statement used the firmer word  ''moratorium'' rather than ''suspension,'' which was used by the North Koreans last fall.</p>
        <p>The statement also said that the easing of sanctions would have ''a positive effect'' on plans for a senior North Korean official to visit the United States for talks with the administration. Such a meeting has been broached for some time but has yet to take place.</p>
        <p>The statement concluded with an appeal to the United States to honor North Korea's sovereignty and improve bilateral relations so that North Korea could then ''work to clear the United States of its worries.'' Asked what this phrase meant, a State Department official said, ''It's nice, but we don't know.'' After her quick visit to China, which is scheduled to last less than 36 hours, Dr. Albright will fly to Seoul to learn firsthand details of the summit meeting from South Korea's President, Kim Dae Jung.</p>
