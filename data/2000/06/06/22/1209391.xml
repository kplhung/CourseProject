        <p>The White House conceded today that it might have violated federal privacy guidelines, and it ordered its Office of National Drug Control Policy to stop using a software device that tracks computer users who view the government's antidrug advertisements on the Internet.</p>
        <p>To monitor traffic on its Internet sites for children and parents, the White House's drug policy office has employed computer files known as cookies, which are placed in computers electronically -- usually without the knowledge of users -- to monitor their Internet travels.</p>
        <p>The software is widely used by commercial Web sites to record information about the shopping habits and other interests of their users. But White House officials said they saw a distinction between companies tracking customers and the government doing similar monitoring.</p>
        <p>''People shouldn't have to worry when they're getting information from the government that the government is getting information from them,'' said an administration official who worked on the matter.</p>
        <p>The firm that installed the devices, DoubleClick, a New York advertising company that specializes in the Internet, said it used the monitoring software to measure which ads were most effective in sending computer users to the drug office's Web sites.</p>
        <p>DoubleClick outraged privacy-rights advocates and prompted an investigation of the company by the Federal Trade Commission earlier this year when it said it would merge anonymous data about Web surfers with personal information it has in other databases. The company has since suspended the plan, awaiting the outcome of negotiations between the industry and the F.T.C. on voluntary privacy standards.</p>
        <p>''It's totally anonymous,'' a DoubleClick spokesman, Josh Isay, said of the monitoring for the drug policy office. ''It's not used for profiling. It's not shared with anyone else.''</p>
        <p>Most large commercial Internet sites, including those of The New York Times and other news organizations, make use of cookies.</p>
        <p>But the White House, concerned about privacy violations, ordered the practice stopped after it was reported this week by Scripps Howard News Service. The White House also required the destruction of any data gathered by DoubleClick and another contractor, the Coleman Design Group of Washington.</p>
        <p>In the Coleman case, visitors to a drug office Web site for parents were tracked by software that had been installed without the knowledge of even drug officials, aides said.</p>
        <p>''We will take all steps necessary to halt these practices now,'' the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said. White House officials said they did not know if other government sites monitored users but that if they did the practice would stop.</p>
        <p>The drug policy office operates two antidrug Web sites, one for children and another for parents. It will spend $12 million this year, part of a $130 million advertising budget, to direct computer users to those sites.</p>
        <p>Computer users visiting certain youth-oriented Web sites receive banner antidrug ads at the top of their screens. If the users click on those ads to reach the drug policy office, cookies are installed.</p>
        <p>The office also made deals with search engines so that computer users who search the Internet with drug terms like ''pot'' or ''weed'' would receive antidrug advertisements on their computer screens.</p>
        <p>Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the drug policy office, was traveling and could not be reached for comment. But his aides said they had no idea they had crossed any lines of propriety. ''We thought we were doing the right thing,'' said Donald Maple, a senior policy analyst at the office, ''and we thought we were being very sensitive to the nature of privacy.''</p>
        <p>John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, sent a firmly worded letter to the drug office today asking officials to explain how they had reached such arrangements.</p>
        <p>This was not the first time the office has been forced to scale back its antidrug campaign. In January, officials said they would stop reviewing TV scripts under a financial agreement with the networks that had encouraged them to include antidrug messages in the plots of shows.</p>
        <p>Officials reviewed more than 100 episodes of shows like ''E.R.'' and ''Beverly Hills 90210'' before they ran. They said they would continue to reward networks for shows with strong antidrug themes, but they would not review the shows until they had been televised.</p>
