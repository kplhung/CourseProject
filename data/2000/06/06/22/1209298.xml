        <p>IN an effort to capture the cowboy mystique, wealthy executives from high-tech companies are grabbing up land in the Texas hill country between San Antonio and Austin and stocking it with cattle.</p>
        <p>''People buy plots on subdivided ranches, and where they should have 2 cows they'll have 20, plus 2 horses, 3 or 4 sheep and some chickens,'' said Dr. Lew Hunnicutt, an assistant professor of range and animal science at Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos. ''It takes a minimum of 25 to 30 acres to support a cow in Texas hill country.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Hunnicutt is using Global Positioning System technology and digitized mapping in a study designed to find out exactly where cows will graze.</p>
        <p>Two hundred acres of ranch land does not mean 200 acres of grass, he explained. The brush a rancher sees on the range may hide rocky ground or rich clay-based soil that is fine for grazing. So clearing the brush over some types of rocky ground to grow more prairie grass doesn't make sense if the cattle won't walk over it to feed on prairie grasses.</p>
        <p>By analyzing grazing patterns, Dr. Hunnicutt hopes to offer new ranchers information on where to clear their land for cattle and where the land should be left as habitat for wildlife.</p>
        <p>He and Dr. Bob Lyons, a range extension specialist at Texas A &amp; M University, have begun a research program that uses G.P.S.-equipped collars developed to track wild animals to pinpoint exactly where cattle are eating or resting on a 4,200-acre research ranch.</p>
        <p>The G.P.S. unit records longitude and latitude every 15 minutes with a high level of accuracy. The points of data showing a cow's position are downloaded and overlaid onto two types of maps to figure out where the cows are grazing. One is a map illustrating soil types, and the other, using infrared images taken from 20,000 feet, shows which parts of the test ranch have thick vegetation and which are rocky.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Dr. Hunnicutt hopes to use maps like those generated in the study as an education tool.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to convince someone not to use 40 percent of their ranch for grazing,'' he said. ''A lot of hill country isn't good for cows because of the rock and brush. The maps can help ranchers visualize the problem.''</p>
        <p>The G.P.S. collars, which weigh about a pound,  are made by Lotek Wireless of Newmarket, Ontario. They are very rugged because they were designed for use with wild animals like elephants, wildebeest, wolves, reindeer, bears and mountain lions, said Leszek Meczarski, the product manager for G.P.S. items at Lotek.</p>
        <p>The units are waterproof and can withstand the shock of being banged against rocks or trees by running animals, he said. These G.P.S. devices are one-size-fits-all, and they are fitted onto customized collars for the various animals. Lotek even makes tiny G.P.S. units that are embedded in freshwater and saltwater fish for underwater studies.</p>
        <p>Each G.P.S. collar in the cattle study, which costs about $5,000, must be removed weekly to recharge the batteries and download the data via a cable to a computer. The collars made for tracking wild animals typically have a one-year battery life and a transmitter for sending data to overflying aircraft. Each of those collars costs about $7,000.</p>
        <p>The cow collar is a vast improvement over the traditional tool for data collection in agricultural studies: graduate students. ''We could have used grad students to walk around and follow the cows,'' Dr. Hunnicutt said. The problem is that when cows see one of the white pickup trucks from the school, they walk toward it hoping for a treat (hay or food pellets), thus changing their behavior.</p>
        <p>''With the collars, we can plot their movement without human intervention,'' Dr. Hunnicutt said.</p>
        <p>The study uses four collars, which are rotated among the cows so the grazing choices of the entire herd are reflected in the data. Still, a graduate student leaves the pickup truck behind and goes out on horseback twice a day to see if the collared cow is with the herd or off by herself. The student takes notes on behavior to validate the G.P.S. data.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hunnicutt meets with cattle owners, environmentalists and new landowners as part of the university's agricultural extension program. Some of these newer ranchers eagerly attend so-called master naturalist classes to learn how to care for their land, Dr. Hunnicutt said, but others will need convincing with cow grazing maps, spreadsheets and charts.</p>
        <p>The cattle study may help boutique ranchers, but traditional ranchers in Texas already know what their cattle are doing and where they will eat.</p>
        <p>Chuck Kiker, an eighth-generation rancher in the Beaumont area of southeast Texas, can rattle off the protein and nutritional content of the rice and grasses he plants in his pastures.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiker, who interrupted his soybean planting and set his tractor on idle to answer questions in a short interview by cell phone, agreed with Dr. Hunnicutt that the soil was the key: ''When you find a spot that grows good grass, you know it. I know where the cows eat the most.''</p>
