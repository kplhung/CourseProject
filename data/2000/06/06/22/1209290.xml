        <p>Archaeology as a search for hidden truth is a central theme of Michael Ondaatje's new novel, ''Anil's Ghost,'' and was very much on his mind during a recent interview. ''Writing is a kind of archaeological act,'' he said. ''In all my books there is a discovery of a story. You're unearthing and you're learning. The drama is to find out about the characters.''</p>
        <p>For him a novel is both intuitive and exploratory. He said that when he begins a book he never knows the outcome or even the full cast of characters. People suddenly appear, assume identities and move the narrative forward. All this was true of ''The English Patient,'' Mr. Ontaadje's Booker Prize-winning novel (and later an Oscar-winning film), and it is true of ''Anil's Ghost.''</p>
        <p>In his novels Mr. Ondaatje writes about displaced persons, people who are unsure of where they belong and to whom they owe their allegiance: the title character and the Sikh demolitions expert in ''The English Patient,'' Anil Tissera and other characters in ''Anil's Ghost.'' Anil is a young forensic anthropologist who returns from the United States to her homeland, Sri Lanka, on a humanitarian mission. She joins forces with an archaeologist to investigate possible war crimes. The principal subject of their investigation is the skeleton of what appears to be a victim of torture.</p>
        <p>Because Mr. Ondaatje is also a poet, his books are often called poetic novels, a label he greets with dismay: ''I'm not sure I would go out of my way to take poetic novels to a desert island.'' For him, the interplay between his poetry and his fiction is far more subtle. ''William Carlos Williams talked about a poem as something that didn't have any extra parts in it,'' he said. The idea of distillation is carried over into his fiction. This means that his novels are ''tighter, more contained, more suggestive.''</p>
        <p>At the same time they are filled with haunting imagery. In ''Anil's Ghost'' Anil is told the story of the excavation of a lacquered coffin of an ancient Chinese ruler, buried alongside 20 female musicians. The bodies were bones, but the musical instruments -- drums, zithers, bells -- survived. In the fifth century B.C. music was regarded as a moral and spiritual force.</p>
        <p>In a sense Anil is a stand-in for the author, who left Sri Lanka at 11 and grew up in London, where his mother lived after separating from his father. Later he emigrated to Canada. Now 56, he is a Canadian citizen of Indian, Dutch and Sinhalese ancestry, and the book represents his own homecoming to Sri Lanka. This is the first of his four novels to take place in his native country, he said, although he has dealt with it before in his poetry and in his memoir, ''Running in the Family.''</p>
        <p>Sri Lanka is, in fact, the reason for the book. He began with a place, a time and an event: a civil war in the mid 1980's. ''I didn't want it to be a tract against Sri Lanka,'' he said. ''I wanted to catch that state of the world, people in that kind of situation, which was a nightmare.'' He intended his story to have emanations of battles in other countries, like Bosnia and Ireland.</p>
        <p>He said he did not want to write about Sri Lanka from the point of view of someone who lived there permanently. Instead he chose as his protagonist ''someone who was a stranger but who had come from that country.'' Anil's insights are shadowed by memories from her childhood. To give an added perspective he decided to make the protagonist a woman ''who had been liberated by living in the West and was now in a country that was a male world.'' That choice, he said, ''gave me an extra pair of glasses and allowed me to see the place differently.''</p>
        <p>As Anil and the archaeologist, Sarath, investigate the mystery of the unknown victim, they themselves and others in their lives are revealed: ''The searchers, the detectives, are the ones who are being discovered in the novel,'' Mr. Ondaatje said. ''We learn how they have been created by their past.'' The ''real forensics'' in the book are about these characters and Sarath's brother, and about an artist who paints eyes on statues of Buddha but is forbidden to look at the face of the deity.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Ondaatje began the book, all he knew about Sarath was that he would be Anil's foil, that he would be more languid in contrast to her enthusiasm and determination. At their first meeting, Sarath is noncommittal, offering the equivalent of ''the Asian nod,'' which is a ''very hesitant head roll that means yes and no,'' the author said. ''It's the kind of thing Henry James should have been doing a lot of.''</p>
        <p>From that point the novel was a matter of accretion, growth and constant revision. Mr. Ondaatje's own obsession is with revising, one reason that it took him eight years to finish the novel, his first since ''The English Patient.''</p>
        <p>Some of the incidents in the new book are drawn from fact; others are invention, for example the astonishing adventure of a surgeon who is kidnapped by rebels and forced to operate on the wounded behind the lines. The rebels also kidnap a nurse and steal medical supplies. The doctor soon finds himself totally caught up in his rescue work.</p>
        <p>Everything of course is filtered through the author's imagination, which often approaches that of such magic realists as Gabriel Garcia Marquez. ''When I read Marquez for the first time,'' he said, ''it was like realism to me. It was like Sri Lanka.'' His most Marquezian book is his memoir, a fanciful dream journey through the lives of his parents and their relatives, eccentrics including an uncle who was killed when a hunting companion mistook him for a wild boar. In the memoir he says that from his mother he received his sense of the dramatic, from his father secrecy and reclusiveness.</p>
        <p>He also writes of strange Sri Lankan traditions: it is believed that if a child eats the tongue of a thalagoya, a crocodile-like reptile, he becomes brilliant. Mr. Ondaatje did not partake of this ''repulsive creature.'' But in his own way, without artificial intelligence or training as a writer, he embarked on a brilliant career in which his literary reputation is matched by his popularity. Both ''The English Patient'' and ''Anil's Ghost'' are best sellers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ondaatje, who went to Canada because his brother Christopher was there, did not start writing until he was in his early 20's. ''I didn't know I wanted to be a writer,'' he said. ''There hadn't been a burning desire.'' But in Canada he felt a sudden freedom and a realization that ''I could attempt anything, I could be a writer or a filmmaker.'' (He has made two documentary films.)</p>
        <p>Encouraged by a teacher at the University of Toronto, he began writing poetry, which ranged from the domestic to the mythological. His first book of poetry was published in 1967. In 1970 he wrote ''The Collected Works of Billy the Kid,'' which was part poem, part historical novel, and was subsequently dramatized onstage. Since then he has alternated between poetry and fiction. He and his wife, Linda Spalding, live in Toronto, where they edit Brick, a literary journal.</p>
        <p>His first novel, ''Coming Through Slaughter,'' inspired by the life of the jazzman Buddy Bolden, was, he said, ''a mental landscape, where you put yourself and real people into an imagined situation.'' ''Anil's Ghost'' was different: fictional people on a real landscape.</p>
        <p>''As someone who has been very much a migrant in my life and as a writer,'' he said, ''one of the things you envy is Faulkner's postage stamp of Yoknapatawpha County or Alice Munro's southwest Ontario. That is the opposite of me, but in some odd way in this book, there is a landscape I knew very well.''</p>
        <p>Annually he spends a month or more in Sri Lanka, where he still has relatives. With some of the Booker Prize money he created an award to encourage Sri Lankan writing. His brother, a wealthy businessman, recently made a large contribution to help build what is known as the new Ondaatje Wing at the National Portrait Gallery in London. The writing award could be considered the author's equivalent of an ''Ondaatje Wing'' in Sri Lanka.</p>
        <p>As the only Canadian to win the Booker Prize, he feels a debt to his adopted country: ''If I lived in Sri Lanka or in England, I think I probably would not have been a writer. Who knows what.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps he would have gone into archaeology? He contemplated the thought and shrugged, an approximation of an Asian nod: a yes-and-no answer to a possible alternative. In his novels of course he is able to be both a writer and an archaeologist.</p>
