        <p>Martin Arnold column on marketing a book to publishers on strength of a magazine article rather than the usual book proposal; recently Warner Books acquired Sean Flynn's book about the December 1999 warehouse fire in Worcester, Mass, solely on the basis of his article in Esquire, and W W Norton acquired Alston Chase's book about Theodore J Kaczynski, the Unabomber, based on an article in Atlantic Monthly together with a proposal; photos (M)</p>

        <p>Lately it seems as if the tables of contents in magazines are becoming the nonfiction shopping lists for book publishers. Just within the last week, for instance, this fascination with magazine cover stories has had publishers thrashing over those in Esquire and The Atlantic Monthly.</p>
        <p>In the July issue of Esquire, the cover article was about the Worcester, Mass., warehouse fire last December in which six firefighters died. The headline inside the magazine, although not out front, was ''The Perfect Fire,'' an obvious knockoff of the title of the best-selling Sebastian Junger book and  George Clooney movie ''The Perfect Storm.'' Within 24 hours the article was sold to Warner Books for a sizable six-figure advance. Moreover, the article, as it appeared in the magazine, was apparently considered such a potent awareness builder for a full-length work that it was sold without a book proposal or even an auction for potential buyers. According to Variety the story is already ''sending twitters'' around Hollywood. (The publisher, at least, promises the book will have a fresh title.)</p>

        <p>In the July issue of Esquire, the cover article was about the Worcester, Mass., warehouse fire last December in which six firefighters died. The headline inside the magazine, although not out front, was ''The Perfect Fire,'' an obvious knockoff of the title of the best-selling Sebastian Junger book and  George Clooney movie ''The Perfect Storm.'' Within 24 hours the article was sold to Warner Books for a sizable six-figure advance. Moreover, the article, as it appeared in the magazine, was apparently considered such a potent awareness builder for a full-length work that it was sold without a book proposal or even an auction for potential buyers. According to Variety the story is already ''sending twitters'' around Hollywood. (The publisher, at least, promises the book will have a fresh title.)</p>
        <p>The Atlantic Monthly's June issue had on its cover ''Harvard and the Making of the Unabomber,'' and, after an auction, a book based on it was sold to W. W. Norton for an advance of more than $300,000.</p>
        <p>There's nothing new about turning magazine articles into books. John Hersey's classic ''Hiroshima'' was first published as the entire issue of The New Yorker in 1946 before becoming a Knopf book; like it, Rachel Carson's 1962 book ''The Silent Spring'' (Houghton Mifflin) also first appeared in The New Yorker. More recently, there is Michael Paterniti's soon-to-be-published ''Driving Mr. Albert'' (Dial Press), the true chronicle of conveying Einstein's brain across the United States in a car trunk that first appeared in Harper's; Jon Krakauer's ''Into Thin Air'' and ''Into the Wild,'' (both Villard), grew from work in Outside magazine. But The New Yorker still seems to be the best source. ''The Tipping Point'' (Little, Brown), by Malcolm Gladwell, was an expansion of an article in that magazine, and so, too, was Anthony Bourdain's ''Kitchen Confidential'' (Bloomsbury).</p>
        <p>The question really is whether these concepts would have as quickly and as lucratively become books had they not been prominent magazine articles and instead were peddled only through the traditional method of authors' agents submitting written, often lengthily, book proposals to editors and publishers. A book proposal is the prospectus or the campaign map of a concept, showing how the writer will attack the material, laying out in almost diagnostic fashion what will be in the finished manuscript. And it shows the author's mastery of material and writing style, although it's not uncommon for a really good book writer to produce a really terrible proposal. Which is one of the risks of the game.</p>
        <p>David Black, one of a few literary agents known for torturing clients into writing the perfect proposal, sold Sean Flynn's story of the Worcester inferno to Rick Horgan, an executive editor at Warner Books without a proposal and without offering it to another publisher. It's something he doesn't like to do. This was an anomaly. ''Most magazines are running shorter pieces, rather than longer ones,'' Mr. Black said, ''so you need a good proposal to develop the blueprint for a book. In this case, the piece was long and didn't need the transition. You got a lot of the framework.'' He says a well-done proposal is not only a selling point but usually leads to a well-done book: ''Most of my client list are journalists, and most of them spend a lot of time developing proposals before the book is sold.'' Often, of course, his clients have both: a magazine article and a proposal. He said, ''With a great proposal, you have a writer who has thought through the larger themes; what they are presenting is a larger canvas.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Horgan of Warner Books said that ''the shorter magazine piece makes the dramatic arch of the story visible, and sometimes the conclusion you reach is that a magazine article is the best format for that particular story.'' He said: ''Generally I want a proposal, but this time it was obvious from the magazine article that if the writer had more room to work with he could have layered in more material, deeper characters. We did have a lengthy conversation on how the book should be shaped.''</p>
        <p>Publishing is a risk business involving, among many factors, keeping one's eye on the competition. ''It's incumbent on editors these days to take a flier once in a while,'' Mr. Horgan said. ''So I decided to make a quick offer. I called David at 9:30 a.m. last Tuesday, and we had a deal in principal in place by 2 p.m. We both took a risk. You can get carried away in the fray of an auction while you're evaluating the competition. We have a saying here that sometimes he who wins the auction loses.''</p>
        <p>Over at W. W. Norton, its editor in chief, Starling Lawrence, had a proposal on Alston Chase's story of Theodore J. Kaczynski, the Unabomber, from Mr. Chase's agent, Deborah Grosvenor. It elaborated on the Atlantic article and offered material not in it, including information about Mr. Kaczynski's sexual history that goes somewhat beyond the court records of the case, which revealed that he had considered a sex-change operation.</p>
        <p>''The proposal also showed the direction in which a book would grow from a magazine article, how Alston would attack the subject, and what his insights are,'' Mr. Lawrence said. ''You always want to see the thinking that makes a book from a magazine article.'' David Hirshey, the executive editor of HarperCollins and the former editor of Esquire, said that although ''it seems insane to pay out so much based on a magazine piece, these articles can be very seductive because it gives the book editor a tangible illustration of what the book could turn out to be.'' But he added: ''It's much like viewing a movie trailer. Often you see great trailers turned into disappointing movies. The best of all possible worlds is a great magazine piece and a proposal that says, 'Here's what I didn't say in the magazine and it's even better than what you read.' ''</p>
        <p>There are agents who encourage their clients to negotiate their own magazine sales, because such sales take up too much time for 15 percent of relatively small fees. This will certainly change if the trend from magazine cover into lucrative book deal gets even more bullish. For if it does, the same material will then command not one but two, more robust paydays; or even three, if there's a movie at the end of the line.</p>
