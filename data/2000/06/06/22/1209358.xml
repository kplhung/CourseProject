        <p>A 28-year-old man admitted today that he strangled eight women here over two years, entering a guilty plea that will spare him the possibility of execution.</p>
        <p>The defendant, Kendall L. Francois, had confessed details of the murders when he was arrested in 1998, the police said, but he pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder at his indictment. Later, when Mr. Francois tried to change his plea to guilty -- a step that would avoid the possibility of execution -- the Dutchess County district attorney, William V. Grady, refused to accept it, saying he wanted to seek the death penalty.</p>

        <p>A 28-year-old man admitted today that he strangled eight women here over two years, entering a guilty plea that will spare him the possibility of execution.</p>
        <p>The defendant, Kendall L. Francois, had confessed details of the murders when he was arrested in 1998, the police said, but he pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder at his indictment. Later, when Mr. Francois tried to change his plea to guilty -- a step that would avoid the possibility of execution -- the Dutchess County district attorney, William V. Grady, refused to accept it, saying he wanted to seek the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grady said today that he still favored execution, but that he allowed Mr. Francois to plead guilty chiefly because some victims' relatives did not want details of the crimes made public at a trial.</p>
        <p>''Many of the families do not want their children and grandchildren needlessly exposed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grady added that although he believes that Mr. Francois was not insane at the time, the defendant does have clear psychological problems that might lead a jury to decide against the death penalty. Theoretically, that would make it possible for Mr. Francois to be paroled someday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Francois, who contracted H.I.V. in 1995, said in court today that he had received no medication during his 22 months in jail.</p>
        <p>As he stood before Judge Thomas J. Dolan of County Court, Mr. Francois's one-word answers were murmured and barely audible. Judge Dolan and Mr. Grady asked him to speak up several times.</p>
        <p>The lack of detail in his answers enraged Heidi Cramer, the daughter of a victim, Sandra Jean French. Outside court, she said she had expected a full description of Mr. Francois's actions and remorse.</p>
        <p>''I want a public disclosure of everything he did to our mother,'' she told reporters. ''His mother can go visit him in jail any time. I can't go visit my mother, except in an urn in my closet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Francois has admitted storing the decomposing bodies of victims in his home for two years. His mother, Paulette Francois, who lived with him in the house, was never charged with any crime, and has made virtually no public statements about the case since her son's arrest.</p>
        <p>Today, in a written statement given to reporters by her lawyer, she expressed sympathy for the victims' families and gratitude toward prosecutors for accepting the guilty plea.</p>
        <p>''We have always believed that death followed by more death is not a solution and never will be,'' she wrote.</p>
