        <p>The Mets would like to add a starting pitcher, a reliever and an outfielder, and last night they added another item to their wish list.</p>
        <p>Shortstop Rey Ordonez, the three-time Gold Glove winner who has been out for three weeks with a broken forearm, will have season-ending surgery on Monday. The Mets could have a match with the Baltimore Orioles, who are scouting the Mets' farm system and whose officials are discussing the idea of trading Mike Bordick to New York. For the moment, though, the Mets will continue to use Kurt Abbott and Melvin Mora at short.</p>
        <p>A pregame conversation with Manager Bobby Valentine led Mora to believe he will be playing more often. ''He said he likes the way I play short and he said I know Alfonzo for a long time,'' Mora said. ''And then, as soon as you feel comfortable over there, the middle of the infield is going to be fine.''</p>
        <p>Both Mora and second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo are from Venezuela, and they have played together in winter ball. Valentine would not characterize the conversation, other than to say he told Mora he would be playing less often in the outfield. Mora has been used infrequently in the outfield since Ordonez's injury on May 29. He has started seven games at short; Abbott has started 10.</p>
        <p>Ordonez was injured in Los Angeles while applying the tag on a pickoff play. He had leaped into the air for a wide throw from first baseman Todd Zeile, and his left forearm was exposed when he came down to go for the tag. The Dodgers' F. P. Santangelo was sliding headfirst, and his helmet crashed into Ordonez's arm, breaking the ulna bone.</p>
        <p>A follow-up exam yesterday revealed that the bone was healing improperly, at a 10-15 percent angle, according to General Manager Steve Phillips. Ordonez will have a plate and screws inserted to connect both sides of the fracture to reduce the angulation, and Phillips said the shortstop will be ready for next spring training.</p>
        <p>Ordonez left Shea Stadium without comment, but Alfonzo said Ordonez was frustrated because he thought he had been progressing. But Ordonez told Alfonzo that the injury had become very painful in recent days.</p>
        <p>''He helped us a lot on the field, saved us a lot of runs,'' Alfonzo said. ''Every pitcher for this team is going to miss him. I'm not saying the two guys are not doing the job, but Rey is always there to make the spectacular catch and do unbelievable things.''</p>
        <p>Ordonez, who was scheduled to return around the All-Star Game break, was batting .188, with no home runs and only nine runs batted in. In 16 games since the injury before last night, Abbott and Ordonez had combined to hit .232 with three homers and nine R.B.I. as shortstops.</p>
        <p>''I think we'll be able to compensate for it and overcome it,'' Phillips said. But ''there's no question a three-time Gold Glove winner is a big loss for your club.''</p>
        <p>Over the last three weeks, Phillips said there have been some plays that Ordonez probably would have made. But he said he did not think the Mets have been ''severely impacted'' defensively by the loss, and the sense around the team is there is no replacing Ordonez's glove.</p>
        <p>''As long as we can make the routine play, that's what's important,'' said Cookie Rojas, the Mets' infield coach. ''The spectacular play that Ordonez makes, there's only one guy that can do that.''</p>
        <p>Immediately after Ordonez's injury, the Mets contacted the Dodgers about Jose Vizcaino and called the agent for Kevin Stocker. But Vizcaino was traded to the Yankees Wednesday and Stocker signed with Anaheim. Phillips did not sound optimistic last night about his chances of finding a shortstop.</p>
        <p>''There are not really obvious choices out there,'' Phillips said. ''Teams are not going to give up their starting shortstop to you, and I'm not sure any backups are better than what our guys have done or can do.''</p>
        <p>Ordonez signed a four-year, $19 million contract before the season, and the deal did not include a no-trade clause. That gives the Mets flexibility to deal him should they make a push to sign Alex Rodriguez, who will be a free agent at the end of the year. By not playing, Ordonez's trade value will probably be low if the Mets try to move him this winter.</p>
