        <p>Lou Savarese, Mike Tyson's opponent in Saturday's heavyweight fight in Scotland, is like a large version of Lou Carnesecca.</p>
        <p>He talks about Italian food. He talks about it often, dissecting the ingredients of the perfect eggplant parmigiana recipe. He talks respectfully of his elders and how he learned from them over frequent, and lengthy, family dinners. He talks about growing up in a blue-collar New York and speaks with an accent mixing the two boroughs where he has lived, Brooklyn and the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''I'm from a very traditional New York family,'' Savarese said Tuesday. ''We all worked in construction. We all broke our backs doing it.''</p>
        <p>He is good-natured, easygoing. Even in the untamed world of boxing, everybody seems to agree that Savarese is likable.</p>
        <p>''I do like Lou, and Mike likes Lou,'' Mike Tyson's manager, Tommy Brooks, said Tuesday. ''That's why we're going to cut him a break.''</p>
        <p>This being the untamed world of boxing, that means Tyson plans to knock out Savarese quickly. ''Why make the guy suffer?'' said Brooks, who also once trained Savarese. ''Let's get it over and not punish him.''</p>
        <p>This kind of talk does not faze Savarese. He has already been tormented by Tyson, having to wait through months of delays, postponements and false starts -- always with the hope of one day climbing in the ring with Tyson.</p>
        <p>For Savarese, a good but hardly polished fighter with a 39-3 ring record, it is the fight that can make a long, indefinable career worth it.</p>
        <p>''It's been a little crazy, but I'm not in this big circus without him,'' Savarese said of Tyson. ''I knew what was going to happen. You'd have to have lived in a hole the last five years to not know this was going to be a roller-coaster ride all the way.</p>
        <p>''But I'm a heavyweight fighter and right now, tell me somebody else you would rather be fighting? He's the famous name in the division. It's a blessing, an opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Savarese's biggest previous fight was a loss to Michael Grant, a lapse that Savarese acknowledges was costly to his reputation. But he has a plan to defeat Tyson, and it comes from the mind of his trainer, Jesse Reid.</p>
        <p>Reid trained Tyson in the 1990's, albeit for only a week.</p>
        <p>''I left,'' Reid said. ''I didn't have a problem with Mike. But I did with all the people around him.''</p>
        <p>In recent days, Reid has spent considerable time casting Tyson as a forlorn, almost pitiable soul. And one who may be goaded into losing his poise and control in the ring.</p>
        <p>''I can see the turmoil around him,'' Reid said. ''I see the confusion and the anger in him. I like confusion. I think we're fighting a man who is angry at a lot of different things. Everybody has been coming after him. We definitely want to capitalize on that.''</p>
        <p>In Savarese's training camp, they have worked on relaxation in the ring, weathering the violent assaults Tyson is known for, extending the fight into the later rounds.</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying we're going to see a lesser Tyson,'' Reid said. ''I want Lou to expect to see the best Mike Tyson. The word Tyson is a big thing in this sport. This isn't some flake who is coming in.</p>
        <p>''But people see Lou Savarese as just the opponent in this fight, too. And Lou is preparing to win. We're going to show people what an opponent is supposed to be like.''</p>
        <p>Savarese has waited years for his career to develop to the point that he could be called a qualified opponent for Tyson. He does not find that designation demeaning.</p>
        <p>''No, not at all,'' Savarese said, smiling. ''I know how this game works. I'm benefiting from all this. But I've got my own plans and goals. I'm not wrapped up in him or the hype or anything going on around him. My family might have been regular people, but I was raised a certain way. First of all, foremost of all, you go in to win something like this. I'm got my own self-preservation to worry about.''</p>

        <p>Tyson Arrives in Scotland</p>
        <p>AP</p>
        <p>Mike Tyson is in Scotland with the British Boxing Board of Control's blessing for his fight against Lou Savarese Saturday night.</p>
        <p>About 100 people, many of them newspaper photographers and television cameramen, were outside when Tyson's limousine pulled up outside his hotel. About 700 people had greeted Tyson outside his hotel during a stop in Manchester, England, but that hotel was more accessible because it fronted the street. There is a driveway up to the Hilton.</p>
        <p>Perhaps another 50 onlookers were in the lobby as Tyson made his way to the elevator. Several took pictures, and he stopped to pose with one man and to sign some autographs. He was heard to say ''thank you,'' before disappearing into the elevator.</p>
        <p>Several hours before Tyson's arrival, the board of control announced it had granted Tyson a license to fight, subject to the results of a prefight physical.</p>
