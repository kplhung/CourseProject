        <p>''Alchemy,'' answered Stanislav Libensky. The question was how Mr. Libensky and his wife, Jaroslava Brychtova, arrive at the sublimely pure colors that define their work as glass artists, and it seemed an almost plausible explanation for the genius that has made them among the most respected artists in their medium today.</p>
        <p>In fact, there is nothing mysterious about the Libenskys' work. They have spent nearly half a century refining the art and technique of casting huge chunks of delicately colored glass. A rare and harmonious collaboration between husband and wife underpins their work, which is having a major retrospective at the Heller Gallery on West 14th Street in Manhattan through June 30.</p>
        <p>''They are really the towering figures in the 20th century in the realm of glass sculpture,'' said Robert Kehlmann, an American critic, himself a glass artist. ''Libensky-Brychtova are really dealing with sculpture, and they are dealing with it not on a tabletop scale, but at the scale which sculpture has come to be in the 20th century.''</p>
        <p>Their scale was always big. ''The River of Life,'' at the 1970 World Exhibition in Osaka, Japan, weighed 13 tons and measured 14.5 feet high and 72 feet long, all of it cast glass, in three towering sections. Other mammoth pieces include ''Big Conus,'' a 12.5-foot-high tower for the 1967 Montreal Exposition, and the hauntingly translucent ''Green Eye of the Pyramid,'' now at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York State. On a recent visit to his studio here, the diminutive Mr. Libensky and Mrs. Brychtova, who is slightly taller than her husband, were dwarfed by the massive, 6.5-foot-tall ''Angel'' of smoky gray glass.</p>
        <p>Scale is half of their alchemy. The other half is light.</p>
        <p>''There is an illuminating space within this material that doesn't exist in any other medium,'' said Mr. Libensky as he took a visitor through the basement studio in his hillside house in the foothills of the Ore mountains, where glassmakers have worked since the 14th century. ''That is why we are attracted by glass and why we can't leave it, really, even though glass has many disadvantages.''</p>
        <p>In the hands of masters like Tiffany, Daum, Lalique and Galle, glass teetered on what Mr. Libensky's teacher, Josef Kaplicky, described as ''the boundaries where the sphere of creative spirit ends and the empire of monotonous craft begins.'' Like their predecessors, the Libenskys push glass work from the decorative arts to the fine arts.</p>
        <p>''They were willing to explore the inherent qualities of the glass itself,'' said Katya Kohoutova Garrow, a partner in the Heller Gallery. ''They said, 'If we do a bas-relief, that's interesting, but not as interesting as if you look at it through the flat surface where you see its plasticity, and the density and thickness of the glass create the sculpture's volume and color.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Libensky paints and sketches, and Ms. Brychtova makes clay sculptures from his designs. Master craftsmen follow with plaster molds that are filled with glass shards and ''fired'': heated for two or three days and slowly cooled for as long as a month. Ms. Garrow says it is Ms. Brychtova who teases the genius out of Mr. Libensky's drawings, endlessly perfecting the surfaces and the shapes.</p>
        <p>They were both married when they met in Zelezny Brod, and their artistic infatuation soon led to a romance that scandalized this small North Bohemian town. So Mr. Libensky returned to Prague to teach at the Academy of Decorative Arts, while Ms. Brychtova stayed to direct the architectural glass studio at Zelezny Brod. Five years later they married.</p>
        <p>The political turmoil after the 1948 Communist putsch, and the show trials and purges of important pre-World War II artists virtually wiped out abstract art. But it allowed the Libenskys a professional freedom. The Communist-era construction boom demanded massive sculptures to beautify the new palaces of the proletariat, a boon for glass artists, because, Mr. Libensky said, ''the state didn't see glass as art.''</p>
        <p>Bereft of quality fine arts to submit to the 1958 Brussels World's Fair, the Communists turned to decorative arts, and the Libenskys designed a wall of flagstone-size colored glass blocks with reversed reliefs of wild animals, reminiscent of Stone Age cave paintings. Their work, innovative art that did nothing to glorify socialism, slid in to the exhibition as a piece of architecture. ''Art went in through the back door,'' Ms. Brychtova said.</p>
        <p>The gradual liberalization of the Prague Spring reform Communist movement in the mid-1960's encouraged the Libenskys artistically and politically. Their 1964 windows for the chapel in Prague Castle for the Czech patron saint, St. Wenceslas, are a melding of plates of softly colored glass.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the Prague Spring, they began work in 1967 on a massive installation for the Osaka World's Fair. Made of clear glass cast in vast chunks and strung together on a steel frame, ''The River of Life'' was meant, said Mr. Libensky, to show ''the system of life in this country'' from birth through youth to the dancing feet of freedom and then, finally, the deep imprints of army boots.</p>
        <p>''The River'' was installed in Osaka just two years after the 1968 Soviet-led invasion crushed the reforms. In a moment of inspired puckishness, a sculpture of marching soldiers by a fellow Czech, Vladimir Janousek, was positioned so that it appeared to be marching from the nearby Soviet pavilion to the boot marks of ''The River,'' as if it were a representation of the Russian and Germany armies that had occupied his homeland for most of his life. ''The Russian and Czech potentates recognized what this was about straight off,'' said Mr. Libensky, and he was forced to sand off the boot prints from ''The River.''</p>
        <p>Osaka secured the Libenskys' international reputation, but it also guaranteed that the Communists would never again allow them such exposure. On their return to Czechoslovakia, the Libenskys were interrogated, expelled from the party and for some years forbidden to travel abroad, although he stayed at the academy, training nearly all of today's prominent Czech glass artists. She remained in Zelezny Brod. They won commissions for Czechoslovak embassies and even for the Federal Czechoslovak Parliament, but many more for such places as a Prague subway station, hotel lobbies and government offices. The state kept most of the income from whatever pieces they did sell abroad.</p>
        <p>Some Czech glass artists were able to study in Mr. Libensky's studio and cast their work at Ms. Brychtova's atelier; today a generation of them owe their careers to the couple. The Libenskys' influence has been particularly strong in the United States, where they first visited in the mid-1980's to teach at the prestigious Pilchuk Glass School near Seattle.</p>
        <p>Now 79 and still recovering from lung cancer, Mr. Libensky is reluctant to talk about the influences on his current work, or why he has abandoned the bright pastel colors for somber grays and browns. But Ms. Brychtova, who is 75, says: ''The last four years the theme is inner space, and all the things he created while he was ill and he was shown the X-rays of his own body. All this you see here reminds him of his own body.'' She pointed to the stacks of gray-and-black canvases spread around the studio.</p>
        <p>ARTS ABROAD  Correction:  June 27, 2000, Tuesday  A picture caption on Thursday  with an Arts Abroad article about Stanislav Libensky and Jaroslava Brychtova, a Czech couple who are highly regarded glass artists, misidentified the person holding a glass rainbow in the making. He is Jan Votava, an employee in the couple's workshop, not Mr. Libensky.</p>
