        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>BUSH RESPONDS TO SENATORS  Five moderate Republican senators who support abortion rights sent a letter on April 12 to Gov. George W. Bush, the party's presumptive presidential nominee, asking him to ''take the lead'' in changing the Republican platform's anti-abortion plank. They also invited Mr. Bush to lunch. On Tuesday, they got a response -- to the lunch invitation. One senator, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said he still sought a ''more specific response'' on abortion and remained hopeful he would get it. Mr. Bush and platform leaders have said they intend to leave the plank -- which calls for an end to legalized abortion and the appointment of judges who ''respect the sanctity of innocent human life'' -- as it is. As for the lunch, Mr. Bush indicated he would try to make one if his schedule permitted, Mr. Specter said.</p>

        <p>NEW PROPOSAL ON COMPUTER EDUCATION  Gov. George W. Bush yesterday proposed another $80 million annually in federal grants to not-for-profit education centers in low-income neighborhoods that help teach children and adults to use computers. ''The great challenge facing America is whether all people will have access to new technologies,'' he said. The setting in which he introduced his plan, a Hispanic neighborhood in Los Angeles, was arguably more significant than its details. Mr. Bush has frequently appeared with minorities to bolster his claim of being a new kind of Republican and is aggressively courting the Hispanic vote. Later in the day, he flew to Houston to speak to the annual convention of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. Last year, Mr. Bush provoked complaints from minority journalists at a conference in Seattle when he declined an invitation to address them.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>NEW CHOICE IN MICHIGAN RACE  The already close Michigan Senate race between the incumbent freshman Republican, Spencer Abraham, and his Democratic challenger, Representative Debbie Stabenow, tightened a bit further this week with the entry of Mark Forton, a Reform Party candidate and supporter of Patrick J. Buchanan. Mr. Forton, a 53-year-old former Republican leader in politically powerful Macomb County, will probably not sway legions of voters, but might cause Mr. Abraham problems by attracting Republicans upset by the senator's efforts to help loosen immigration restrictions to let companies hire more foreign workers. Mr. Forton said he would make immigration a top issue.</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>BUSH SURGES IN CONNECTICUT  Gov. George W. Bush has erased the nine-point advantage Vice President Al Gore had among Connecticut voters in April, a new poll released yesterday by Quinnipiac University showed. The two presidential candidates are now in a virtual tie, with Mr. Gore at 43 percent and Mr. Bush at 42 percent, well within the poll's margin of sampling error of 2.7 percentage points.</p>

        <p>THE DEBATES</p>
        <p>THRESHOLD SET ON QUALIFIERS  A bipartisan panel supervising the presidential debates said yesterday that candidates qualifying for the first debate on Oct. 3 would be determined by results of five national polls on Sept. 26. The panel's chairmen, Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. and Paul G. Kirk Jr., said that anyone with average support of 15 percent or more in the polls would be invited to the debate, to be held at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. Participants in the other debates, on Oct. 11 at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Oct. 17 at Washington University in St. Louis, are to be based on polls taken just before them. Despite objections by Patrick J. Buchanan, Ralph Nader and other third-party candidates, officials said the threshold would not change. Mr. Buchanan argues that Mr. Kirk and Mr. Fahrenkopf, respectively former Democratic and Republican chairmen, should not decide which third-party candidates qualify.</p>
