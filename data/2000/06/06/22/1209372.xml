        <p>The identity of Al Michaels's new boothmates on ABC's ''Monday Night Football'' should be known soon, even by tomorrow. If Dan Fouts is one of the choices -- he is at least the leak of the week -- who is the other?</p>
        <p>One imagines that Don Ohlmeyer, who is producing the ''Monday Night'' overhaul, wants to stun the television world. Decent as Fouts is, he would be a safe, traditional choice as his TV career at CBS and ABC has never been memorable.</p>
        <p>In this convoluted episode of ''Secret Star Search,'' Fouts could be Coach Ohlmeyer's decoy, faking a move from college football but going nowhere.</p>
        <p>Ohlmeyer made a move yesterday, cutting Lesley Visser as ''Monday Night's'' sole sideline reporter after a two-year run, with plans to add two reporters. Visser said, ''It's a producer's privilege to create his own broadcast.''</p>
        <p>Back in the booth, though, Ohlmeyer must create credible buzz, although he can't hire John Madden, Phil Simms, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long or Cris Collinsworth, and Jimmy Johnson didn't want to unretire for Monday nights.</p>
        <p>''You couldn't pick a more difficult time to pull something like this off,'' one industry official said.</p>
        <p>The silly suggestions that Ohlmeyer cast comedians like Chris Rock or Billy Crystal presumes that they are qualified to offer much more than one-liners or will devote more than a sliver of their busy schedules to football.</p>
        <p>Ohlmeyer's choice is said to be someone ignored by the news media speculation about his overhaul of the post-Boomer Esiason booth. That talent pool still includes the Teletubbies, Monica Lewinsky and Eminem.</p>
        <p>An inspired choice would be ESPN's Andrea Kremer. She is ESPN's best football reporter and highly respected by players. Before ESPN, she worked at NFL Films as a producer, where she built her knowledge of football's intricacies.</p>
        <p>''Her greatest strength was preparation,'' said Steve Sabol, the president of NFL Films. ''She would never go into anything uninformed.''</p>
        <p>She is not widely known, but she would undoubtedly generate enormous publicity as the first woman to call National Football League games regularly. Gayle Sierens called one regional game for NBC in 1988. Certainly, Kremer's hiring would raise the attention level and critical scrutiny accorded 30-year-old ''Monday Night.''</p>
        <p>She would be held to a higher standard because she is a woman and monitored for her chemistry with her partners and the strength of her voice.</p>
        <p>But if she succeeded in making a strong transition from live reports and taped features to booth commentary, she would most likely rope in female viewers.</p>
        <p>But Kremer has been overlooked by Ohlmeyer.</p>
        <p>''She hasn't been contacted, although I recommended her for the sideline job,'' Sandy Montag, her agent, said.</p>
        <p>He said the notion of Kremer in the booth ''is not the craziest idea in the world.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''She has as much football knowledge as many men in the business.''</p>
        <p>Football smarts may not be the ticket for the ''Monday Night'' job. Controversy and unpredictability look like the prerequisites, although there are few such personalities with those qualities. Even Madden, unpredictable on his best days, has never been controversial.</p>
        <p>The gold standard for ''Monday Night'' controversy was Howard Cosell, and he produced no known clones. When he quit the show in 1983, Cosell took all controversy with him as if he had invented it.</p>
        <p>Rush Limbaugh auditioned for ABC, but his politics make him a long shot, despite his Cosellian divisiveness. He also broke the omerta by publicly discussing his tryout. Another disputatious voice, Jim Rome, the host of cable's ''The Last Word,'' is locked into a deal with Fox Sports Net.</p>
        <p>So as ABC operates under Ohlmeyer's cone of silence, we await his bombshell -- if he actually has one.</p>
