        <p>The Irish building materials company CRH P.L.C. acquired the American companies Dolomite Group and Northern Ohio Paving Company, for $160 million in cash and assumed debt. The two companies produce asphalt, concrete and gravel, and their combined sales totaled $131 million last year. CRH, which operates in the United States as Oldcastle Materials, has spent almost $1 billion on acquisitions of American companies in the last 12 months, and those divisions provide more than half the company's revenue. Earlier this year, CRH bought the Shelly Company of Ohio for $350 million.</p>
