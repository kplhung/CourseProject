      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Out for breakfast in a small-town restaurant, Wanda Huffman, 42, led her children in prayer.</p>
        <p>Then she shook her head in dismay.</p>
        <p>''I wonder how long it will be,'' she said, ''before they tell us we can't pray in public places.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Huffman was outraged by the ruling by the United States Supreme Court on Monday that student-led prayers at high school football games are unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>In this conservative small town, 58 miles west of Chicago, the court ruling was seen as another attack on homespun values by sneering elitists. Of more than two dozen people interviewed here, not a single person defended the ruling.</p>
        <p>Indeed, people despaired of an emerging American culture that allows for gay Boy Scout leaders, but grows skittish about students who want to pray. And they often saw the curbs on prayer as part of a greater effort to impose government regulations, like gun control. But more than anything, they saw it as a lapse of common sense.</p>
        <p>''We're in the trouble we're in because there's not enough prayer,'' said Denise Spooner, standing outside the Wal-Mart store on Route 34, as storm clouds gathered. ''If people are bothered by a bunch of kids getting together to pray before a game, well, I just don't understand.''</p>
        <p>In its 6-to-3 decision, the Supreme Court strongly affirmed its earlier rulings against officially sponsored prayer in public schools, saying that prayers led by students at high school football games are no exception. The majority opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens said that even when attendance was voluntary and when the decision to pray was made by students, ''the delivery of a pregame prayer has the improper effect of coercing those present to participate in an act of worship.''</p>
        <p>Here, Jim Wasson, an electrician, said, ''They shouldn't be coerced to pray, but I don't think that's what happens.''</p>
        <p>But people in Plano, a town of 5,100 in the farm country west of Chicago's suburbs, said they could not fathom that young people would succumb to prayer out of peer pressure.</p>
        <p>''Nobody's going to feel like they have to pray,'' said Stephanie Briggs, 18. ''People in school like to do their own thing. Besides that, the players all know each other. They know their religious beliefs. It's not like some pregame prayer is going to mean that much, or change their views.''</p>
        <p>To Shane Shelton, a 30-year-old construction worker, the whole discussion seems a bit silly.</p>
        <p>''The professional players are always praying on the field and talking about God, and that doesn't seem to bother anybody,'' Mr. Shelton said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shelton, who wore a bandanna and shoulder-length hair, said he was not a church-goer and would not join in public prayer sessions.</p>
        <p>''But if somebody else wants to do that, what do I care?'' he said. ''It's about freedom. Just let people pray, if that's what they want to do.''</p>
        <p>Karen Wasson, 55, who owns the Tastee Treet ice cream stand in Plano, lamented that American society had lost its moral bearings and that leaders were unwilling to speak the unvarnished truth about right and wrong.</p>
        <p>''The family is not respected,'' Mrs. Wasson said. ''Religion is not respected. And authority is not respected. We won't stand up for anything.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Wasson, who has been teaching Roman Catholic religion classes for 18 years, said she was sometimes astonished at the cheeky behavior of young people nowadays, even among those enrolled in religious training.</p>
        <p>''Some of the things they say -- in my day, I would have been smacked in the head so hard my head would rotate,'' she said. ''Some of these kids know more about the world at 12 than I did at 24. It's sad, really, that so many kids don't have the chance to just be kids.''</p>
        <p>To Debbie Finley, 39, the court ruling seemed another example of an extreme reaction. ''It's like all these schools getting rid of their Christmas programs,'' she said. ''Everybody is afraid that somebody is going to get offended.''</p>
        <p>Her daughter, Kelsey Finley, 16, plays basketball for the Serena High School team, but saves, she said, her prayers for the Lutheran church.</p>
        <p>''I don't think praying before a game is going to help you win,'' she said, smiling. ''But if other people want to pray, it doesn't bother me.''</p>
        <p>Patricia Bildusas, a 34-year-old secretary, said her family recently turned to home-schooling, in large part because it sensed a hostility toward religion by the public schools.</p>
        <p>''We ought to be telling kids who want to pray, 'More power to you,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spooner saw the court ruling as ''the government stepping into your family's way,'' decreeing what kinds of worship were permissible.</p>
        <p>''It's like, for the last 30 years, they've been reprogramming us about what's right and wrong,'' she said. ''We're being watered down in this country. But there's a higher power than the United States government. We're all going to have to answer to God.''</p>
