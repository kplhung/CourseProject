        <p>An American election observer who was expelled from Mexico in April has been allowed to return and monitor the presidential balloting on July 2.</p>
        <p>The observer, Ted Lewis, who directs the Mexico program of Global Exchange, a human rights group in San Francisco, arrived here on Monday. On his previous visit, he was sent back to the United States just after arriving on April 9 because, immigration authorities said, he did not have the proper visa to be an elections observer.

        <p>An American election observer who was expelled from Mexico in April has been allowed to return and monitor the presidential balloting on July 2.</p>
        <p>The observer, Ted Lewis, who directs the Mexico program of Global Exchange, a human rights group in San Francisco, arrived here on Monday. On his previous visit, he was sent back to the United States just after arriving on April 9 because, immigration authorities said, he did not have the proper visa to be an elections observer. Mr. Lewis disputed that contention.</p>
        <p>Officials of the Federal Elections Institute, the independent agency that is organizing the vote, pressed the government to let Mr. Lewis return, as did some officials in the campaign of the governing party's presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida Ochoa. Global Exchange has the biggest delegation of observers, 65 people.</p>
        <p>''I'm gratified that they let me in,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''But it is alarming that 40 days went by in which the largest observer delegation faced obstacles because its leader was barred from the country.''</p>
