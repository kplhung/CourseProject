        <p>In Zimbabwe's 20 years as an independent nation, one man has led it -- Robert Mugabe. He has never faced a serious challenge. But this weekend the country is to choose a new parliament, and polls show that the opposition would win a fair election.  Zimbabweans may have decided that ''Mugabe'' and ''Zimbabwe'' should no longer be synonymous.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mugabe has responded to the prospect of defeat with demagoguery, violence and intimidation. Gangs of his thugs roam the countryside, killing and beating opposition activists. The balloting and vote count may be flawed, as the government is limiting the number of election observers.  The outside world, especially South Africa and Zimbabwe's smaller neighbors, must press Mr. Mugabe to end the violence, hold a clean vote and vote count and abide by the results.</p>

        <p>In Zimbabwe's 20 years as an independent nation, one man has led it -- Robert Mugabe. He has never faced a serious challenge. But this weekend the country is to choose a new parliament, and polls show that the opposition would win a fair election.  Zimbabweans may have decided that ''Mugabe'' and ''Zimbabwe'' should no longer be synonymous.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mugabe has responded to the prospect of defeat with demagoguery, violence and intimidation. Gangs of his thugs roam the countryside, killing and beating opposition activists. The balloting and vote count may be flawed, as the government is limiting the number of election observers.  The outside world, especially South Africa and Zimbabwe's smaller neighbors, must press Mr. Mugabe to end the violence, hold a clean vote and vote count and abide by the results.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mugabe began his presidency by providing schools and health care to the poor, but over two decades he became an autocrat surrounded by corrupt and brutal men. One reason Zimbabwe has sent 11,000 troops to war in Congo, it is alleged, is that his generals profit from trading in Congo diamonds. The war costs Zimbabwe millions of dollars a month, while half the nation is unemployed.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Mugabe has the support of all but 3 of Parliament's 150 members, and no strong opposition arose until last year, when the Movement for Democratic Change was born to take part in rewriting the Constitution. Mr. Mugabe's draft, which would have broadened his powers, lost in a popular referendum in February. Shaken by the defeat, he began exploiting the issue of land reform. All major parties endorse breaking up large farms, owned mainly by whites, and distributing the land to poor blacks. For 20 years Mr. Mugabe did little. Now, instead of beginning an orderly process with compensation for landowners, he has encouraged his supporters in the violent takeover of white-owned farms. They have killed one farmer and beaten dozens of black farm workers.</p>
        <p>The bloodshed has spread. The opposition cannot campaign in much of the countryside. At least 29 of its candidates and backers have been killed, and many others raped or beaten, often as police stood by. Recently the government offered the opposition some air time and has begun to denounce violence,  but has still made no real effort to stop the thugs.</p>
        <p>It is now impossible for the election to be free. But the opposition is determined to participate and could win if Mr. Mugabe allowed the vote and vote count to proceed without fraud. This means calling off his thugs, sending out word not to meddle with ballots, and allowing all observers access to polling stations and the counting process.</p>
        <p>The United States, Britain, the European Union and the Commonwealth nations should warn Mr. Mugabe that he and his cronies will lose visas for foreign travel and their overseas bank accounts if Zimbabwe's democracy dies. But Western nations are not trusted or beloved by most Zimbabweans.  The most important voice is that of South Africa, which has been disappointingly silent. President Thabo Mbeki and the rest of southern Africa's presidents should speak out publicly, as Botswana has done. Southern African nations have a powerful interest in keeping Zimbabwe from political and economic collapse.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 28, 2000, Wednesday  An editorial last Thursday misstated the number of white farmers in Zimbabwe who have been killed by President Robert Mugabe's supporters. The number is five, not one. And an editorial yesterday gave the wrong location for next month's economic summit meeting in Japan. It will be in Okinawa, not Osaka.</p>
