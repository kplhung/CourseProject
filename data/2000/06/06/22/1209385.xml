        <p>The official term is ''supplemental adjustment,'' but opponents call it ''the poor tax.''</p>
        <p>Whatever name is used, it is the surcharge that rent regulators have imposed on low-cost apartments in New York City in 14 of the last 17 years. The cumulative effect has been to sharply raise prices at the low end of the rental market, a study shows.</p>
        <p>The surcharges have been much debated and are likely to be debated again tonight when the Rent Guidelines Board votes on annual increases for the city's 1 million rent-stabilized apartments.</p>
        <p>Since the surcharges began in 1983, rents have risen 158 percent, which means a rent of $490 for a tenant who was paying $190 a month and took one-year lease renewals, according to calculations by the Metropolitan Council on Housing, a tenant advocacy group. For apartments not subjected to surcharges, rents rose by only 87 percent, the group said.</p>
        <p>Making the same comparison for tenants taking two-year lease renewals, the council said rent on a $190 apartment rose to $412, or 117 percent, compared with 71 percent for apartments not subjected to surcharges.</p>
        <p>Low-cost rentals are rapidly dwindling. The United States Census Bureau says that the number of apartments renting for less than $500 was cut to 209,725 last year from 417,438 in 1996. The 1998 median annual income of tenants in such apartments was $15,000, compared to $30,000 in those renting for $500 and above.</p>
        <p>The surcharge, a perennial thorny issue for the rent board, comes up for renewal tonight. The board has proposed a $15 monthly surcharge on apartments renting for less than $500, in addition to a general 4 percent increase for one-year leases and 6 percent increase for two-year leases. For an apartment renting for $450 a month, the surcharge would make the total increases 7 percent for one year and 9 percent for a two-year lease.</p>
        <p>Four of the nine board members are against the surcharge, according to advocates for tenants, who say they hope to win one more vote.</p>
        <p>The surcharges began during the Koch administration, were suspended during the Dinkins administration and resumed under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the surcharge say the annual general rent increase, when applied to low-priced apartments, does not yield enough income for landlords to meet their costs.</p>
        <p>''I really hope they keep it; it really helped to make a difference,'' Denis Gittens, a landlord in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, whose 14 two- and three-bedroom apartments rent from $420 to $745, said in a telephone interview. The surcharges enable him to break even sometimes, he said, although now he is behind on his tax, water and fuel oil bills.</p>
        <p>Another owner, Myrtle A. Hamilton, said the surcharges helped the finances for her eight-apartment building in Prospect Heights shift from a deficit to breaking even.</p>
        <p>But critics contend that the surcharges impose the heaviest percentage increases on those least able to afford them. ''The poor tax has done more damage than anything else to the supply of affordable housing,'' the housing council's director, Jenny Laurie, testified at a board hearing last week.</p>
        <p>But landlord representatives have not budged. ''I've never heard anybody say a tenant left because of the low-rent supplement,'' said Dan Margulies, director of the Community Home Improvement Program, a landlord group.</p>
        <p>Jack Freund, executive vice president of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents landlords, said that ''the low-rent adjustment affects poor owners'' because the apartments they apply to are clustered in buildings where owners need the income. He also disputed the claim that the poor are being singled out. ''Just because you live in a low-rent apartment does not mean you are low income,'' he said.</p>
