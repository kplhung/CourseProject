        <p>The chief prosecutor of the international war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia said today that she would not withdraw the indictment against Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, and that she opposed any action by Washington or other governments to let him escape justice.</p>
        <p>''There will not be stability in the Balkans if Milosevic is not brought to justice in The Hague,'' the prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, said at a news conference during a visit to the Kosovo capital today.

        <p>The chief prosecutor of the international war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia said today that she would not withdraw the indictment against Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, and that she opposed any action by Washington or other governments to let him escape justice.</p>
        <p>''There will not be stability in the Balkans if Milosevic is not brought to justice in The Hague,'' the prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, said at a news conference during a visit to the Kosovo capital today. ''I don't think that the man most responsible for what happened here in Kosovo should have preference.''</p>
        <p>The New York Times reported on Monday that the Clinton administration, with some NATO allies and Russia, was exploring the possibility of letting Mr. Milosevic leave office with guarantees that he would not be pursued.</p>
        <p>The United Nations war crimes tribunal, based in The Hague, publicly indicted Mr. Milosevic and four members of his cabinet last year for responsibility for the deaths and expulsion of ethnic Albanians during the war in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Del Ponte firmly rejected any policy change for the tribunal and said her staff was proceeding with investigations against Mr. Milosevic for crimes in Kosovo and in previous wars in the region. ''We are investigating the criminal responsibility of Slobodan Milosevic for Croatia and Bosnia,'' she said.</p>
        <p>They were also preparing additional indictments against other lesser officials, that is police, military and political personnel, both Serbs and others, including even Albanians.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless in a comment that hinted at the overriding power of politics, she said: ''I am a prosecutor, not a politician.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Del Ponte was visiting Kosovo to see the progress of forensic teams that are exhuming bodies from hundreds of sites around Kosovo.</p>
        <p>She has also visited Macedonia and will travel on to the Yugoslav republic Montenegro to ask for its cooperation in the war crimes investigations. Her investigators are banned from Serbia despite repeated requests for access to witnesses.</p>
        <p>In a new development, she said, the tribunal has begun investigations into whether the Kosovo Liberation Army had committed crimes in the conflict, dating back to 1998.</p>
        <p>She said five episodes were under investigation to which members of the now disbanded guerrilla army have been linked. No indictments have been brought against members of the K.L.A. but certain allegations merit investigation, a tribunal spokesman, Paul Risley, said.</p>
        <p>''There are allegations that the K.L.A. were responsible for crimes in five areas and we have an obligation to look at these serious allegations,'' said Graham Blewitt, deputy prosecutor at the tribunal. He and Mrs. Del Ponte refused to discuss the types of crimes being investigated, but there are widely known cases of Serbian civilians abducted by members of the K.L.A. The Serbs have not been found and their disappearance fueled local hatred against the Albanians.</p>
        <p>Tribunal officials estimate that one million Albanians were expelled from their homes and the territory of Kosovo by Serbian forces in the spring of last year and that thousands of civilians were killed.</p>
        <p>There remains uncertainty whether that campaign, apparently orchestrated by the Serbian leadership, amounted to genocide. To bring charges of genocide, prosecutors have to prove the intention to destroy a people or part of a people. ''There are other explanations, and we need to look at those,'' Mr. Blewitt said.</p>
        <p>The question of K.L.A. crimes could not be compared to the organized campaign by Serbian forces, Mr. Blewitt said. They involved fewer victims and cannot be considered genocide, he said. ''The K.L.A. does not get anywhere near that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yet the announcement of an international investigation of crimes by Albanians is bound to have some meaning here. It came the day after a young Serbian couple were shot and wounded near the main street in Pristina on Tuesday evening.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Del Ponte accompanied the chief of the United Nations mission here, Bernard Kouchner, and local Albanian political leaders to lay flowers at the spot of the attack. The two Serbs, a young bank security guard and his girlfriend, a local radio reporter, were found by peacekeeping officers and taken to a hospital, where they were reported to be in a stable condition. Both had been shot several times.</p>
        <p>The attack was close to the busy center of Pristina and highlighted the impunity with which Albanians have conducted revenge attacks.</p>
        <p>The divided town of Mitrovica also exploded into violence today as a Serbian crowd stoned the Albanian driver of a garbage truck and then set fire cars with United Nations or foreign registrations. Several people were injured.</p>
