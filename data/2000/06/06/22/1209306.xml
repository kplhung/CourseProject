        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report (front page, June 19) that secret talks are afoot to find an ''exit strategy'' for President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, with guarantees for his safety and his savings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic is not an isolated case (Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile and many others come to mind), and we should use the occasion to find a permanent way to entice tyrants to renounce power to escape the wrath of nations.</p>
        <p>I propose that Britain present the United Nations with a gift of St. Helena, a remote island in the South Atlantic, famous as the place of Napoleon's final exile, to be used in perpetuity as a retirement home for deposed tyrants.</p>
        <p>Their property should be turned over to the United Nations in return for the protection and management of the island, with an annual modest stipend to individual culprits and their children. They should be provided with modest, individual housing, but a common eatery to promote camaraderie among a growing, multilingual population.</p>
        <p>They would of course be prevented from leaving the island, and even their ashes would have to remain there. No posthumous return should be tolerated.</p>
        <p>Their principal punishment would be to spend the rest of their days in the shadow of Napoleon, reminding them that at least once in history a brutal genius left a great legacy.</p>
        <p>FRITZ STERN  New York, June 20, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is professor emeritus of history at Columbia University.</p>
