        <p>Thousands of Greek Orthodox clerics and followers flooded the center of this capital today to demand that the government retract its decision to remove religious affiliations from citizens' identity cards.</p>
        <p>Carrying Greek flags and crucifixes and chanting, ''Greece is Orthodoxy,'' they cheered as as the head of the Greek Orthodox Church defended the faith as indivisibly bound with the country's identity.</p>
        <p>''Resist, my dear Christians,'' the church leader, Archbishop Christodoulos, said he as offered 90 minutes of antigovernment jabs. ''The forces of globalization and religious marginalization are out to get us.''</p>
        <p>The protest follows a call last month by Prime Minister Costas Simitis's Socialist government to enact a privacy code that bars citizens from declaring details of their faiths, occupations, family status and thumbprints for identity cards. The government says it wants to help protect religious minorities' rights.</p>
        <p>The church, which sees itself as a guardian of Greek tradition and the move as an assault on the Orthodox Christian character of Greece, has said the affiliations on the cards should be optional and has called for a referendum on the issue.</p>
        <p>As teams of priests and nuns directed crowds of followers -- organizers put the number at 800,000 while the police gave estimates of 130,000 to 200,000 -- the archbishop chided the political leadership. ''You should invite us, not shun us, for discussion,'' he said. ''What are you afraid of?''</p>
        <p>Greek Orthodox clerics contend that Mr. Simitis's decision was part of a bid to appear ''more European'' ahead of the European Union endorsement on Tuesday of Greece's entry into the group.</p>
        <p>Archbishop Christodoulos responded to the decision on the identity cards by denouncing Mr. Simitis as a dictator and calling his decision a coup d'etat, arguing that the clergy endorsed his re-election in April on the condition that he would consult with the religious leadership before pressing his change for the identity cards.</p>
        <p>''It's obvious,'' a close aide to the prelate, Metropolitan Prokopios, said, ''that the identity-card issue is just the start of a storm of reforms, ultimately leading to what the Socialists have long sought, a divorce from the church.''</p>
        <p>Similar though smaller protests rattled the country 13 years ago as Andreas Papandreou moved, but later stopped, plans to seize control of church property, including prime real estate that the present government is eyeing to build a lavish resort, ahead of the 2004 Olympics here.</p>
        <p>A recent poll in a daily here, Eleftherotypia, found that 46.1 percent of those surveyed opposed Mr. Simitis's effort to ban religious affiliations from identity cards and that 40 percent supported it.</p>
