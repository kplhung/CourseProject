        <p>NEWS</p>
        <p>Curtain Up  Many civic opera companies are on summer vacation, but the Cincinnati Opera is just starting its season. The opening attraction of the troupe's 2000 Summer Festival, at 8 tonight in Music Hall on Elm Street, is Richard Strauss's ''Salome,'' which will be repeated on Saturday. Coming up are Rossini's ''Cenerentola,'' Debussy's ''Pelleas et Melisande'' and Verdi's ''Aida.''</p>
        <p>Visions  In the middle of the 19th century, in the flowering of the Shakers, who frowned upon art, adherents strove to capture on paper spiritual warnings and encouragement received from brothers and sisters who had gone before. Most of these colorful drawings, more often than not created by women, were interpreted as religious works and taken out of storage only on special occasions. Many were later destroyed by the Shakers themselves. From Saturday until next April 2, the meaning and context of 25 of the drawings that survive will be explored in ''Seen and Received: The Shakers' Private Art'' at the Hancock Shaker Village in Pittsfield, Mass.</p>
        <p>Stepping Out  The doors are open and the feet are flying in Becket, Mass., with the start of the 68th season of the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival. Garth Fagan Dance, returning for the first time since Mr. Fagan won a Tony Award for his choreography for ''The Lion King,'' is the opening attraction in the Ted Shawn Theater through Sunday. Appearing in its debut, tonight through Sunday in the Doris Duke Studio is RhythMEK, a new group featuring former Alvin Ailey stars. The season ends on Aug. 27.</p>
        <p>Museum on the Move  Yeshiva University Museum has a new headquarters. After 27 years at 185th Street and Amsterdam Avenue on the university's Washington Heights campus, the museum, dedicated to education through interpretations of Jewish life, has moved its main galleries and administrative offices to the new Center for Jewish History at 15 West 16th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, in Chelsea. These galleries will be officially inaugurated on Sunday with six exhibitions. In the main-floor gallery, ''Major Intersections,'' reflecting the diversity of Jewish life through more than 2,000 years, draws upon objects, artifacts and texts from the collections of the partners in the Center for Jewish History: the American Jewish Historical Society, the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, the Leo Baeck Institute and the Yeshiva University Museum.</p>
