        <p>Robert Smith, leader of the Cure, is a rainmaker. For three hours on Tuesday night, under skies clear enough to show the Big Dipper above the Jones Beach Amphitheater, he and his band raised an overwhelming squall, enough to hide a quarter-century's worth of their fans' tears.</p>
        <p>The hurricane suited what may be the last Cure concert in the United States, if the capricious Mr. Smith fulfills his latest threat to retire the brand name of a band that for many defines gloomy rock. Leading the band through a melancholy set, taking time to commune with fans lining the stage, Mr. Smith certainly acted as if this show was a parting gift, one great drenching before a drought.</p>
        <p>This Cure was the one less familiar to devotees of modern-rock radio. Any such listeners in attendance had to endure two hours of sustained swooning before a third encore that was all bouncy hits, from ''Lovesong'' to the band's deliciously tense first single, ''Killing an Arab,'' inspired by the Albert Camus novel ''The Stranger.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith's gift for musical effervescence, which has combined with his morbid lyrics and pouty singing to make some of the best weepies on the pop charts, has sometimes overshadowed the Cure's role in shaping post-punk psychedelia. Tuesday's show, like the band's latest album, ''Bloodflowers,'' returned to that shadowy realm.</p>
        <p>In new songs like ''Watching Me Fall'' and old ones like ''Sinking,'' slowly building guitar and keyboard lines melded and diffused until the unfurling counterpoint became inseparable. Mr. Smith, on acoustic and electric guitar, left most of the conspicuous fretwork to the other guitarist, Perry Bamonty, who spent the night in subtle duet with the keyboardist Roger O'Donnell. The drummer Jason Cooper and the bassist Simon Gallup made sure the arcing songs kept their shape; resounding kick drums fed the tension on meltdowns like ''The Kiss.''</p>
        <p>This is a sound that preceded the innovations of neo-psychedelic bands like My Bloody Valentine and influenced the indie rock style pioneered by Pavement. Because Mr. Smith presents himself freakishly in ratted hair and red lipstick, his sad-sack persona has overshadowed his band's breakthroughs. But the Cure live can be as profound as a concert by Neil Young, that standard-bearer of pure rock musicality.</p>
        <p>Tuesday's show often reached that point. The band was able to lock in, each player intuitively completing the others' moves, in a way that many groups try, but few master. The parts were not all that complicated but demanded a sensitivity toward shading that is difficult in an amphitheater like Jones Beach. Things got messy in the new ''39,'' two-thirds of the way through the lengthy set, and the open air meant the sound hit more like waves than a flood. Yet rarely does an arena show so fully reward contemplation.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Young, Mr. Smith has made rock vast enough for languishing. His existential angst can seem overindulgent; he is practically heavy metal in his preoccupation with storms, darkness and death. Yet the reverberant music melts the nihilism, for Mr. Smith remains a devotee of beauty, the grace that can surface even at the point of despair. The Cure's songs not only made rain, they also revealed the light between the drops. If Mr. Smith does decide this is the band's end, that contribution will be missed.</p>
