        <p>GETTING there is supposed to be half the fun, but in the popular genre of real-time strategy games, getting there can sometimes seem like work.</p>
        <p>Dispatched to a destination by the player, vehicles may bump up against stationary objects encountered en route and stop. They wander into cul-de-sacs and can't escape. They push against unclimbable cliffs. They bunch up at corners, looking less like fearsome military units than tourists consulting a map. This is supposed to be fun?</p>
        <p>In Sierra Studios' Ground Control, it is. This three-dimensional strategy game, developed by Sweden's Massive Entertainment, offers spectacular graphics, compelling weapons, simple controls and a manageable structure. But Ground Control is equally instructive in the importance of the routine but vital business of moving through the game environment. It is so lifelike and seamless that simply being in the game is its own reward.</p>
        <p>Set in 2419, Ground Control casts the player as Sarah Parker, of the Crayven Corporation, which is fighting the Order of the New Dawn for control of the planet Krig-7b.</p>
        <p>Starting with a small force of lightly armored vehicles, Parker performs tasks common to games of this type: destroy a convoy, level an enemy base or claim an alien artifact. Unlike games that often require the player to collect resources and build new units, Ground Control typically limits the player to the forces deposited on the planet's surface at the start of a mission.</p>
        <p>The focus on fighting is realistic and helps keep the controls blissfully simple. You select units with the mouse, indicate their destination and off they go -- in a formation and with a combat posture you assign.</p>
        <p>The main vehicle is the armored personnel carrier, from which the player runs the show. It can recharge depleted units nearby and transport infantry. If it is destroyed, the mission ends and you will have to restart from the beginning. (Progress is automatically saved at the end of each completed mission, but no provision is made for saving during a mission.)</p>
        <p>Combat is a vivid experience. The shells from a mobile artillery unit arrive thunderously at their target, transforming durable enemy outposts into blackened ruins with tilted defense turrets. These bright detonations seem real and carry such a feeling of omnipotence that I invariably stopped whatever else I was doing in the game just to watch.</p>
        <p>In fact, I found myself watching Ground Control a lot. I found it exhilarating just to see my units on the move -- whether exploring a jungle or just trundling along an open plain. You can jump to any unit -- indeed, you can adjust the game camera at will -- and there is always a sense of anticipation and threat.</p>
        <p>For example, the artillery unit moves like the real thing, leaving a dust cloud and tread marks in its wake. It lumbers behind the other forces and, unescorted, can fall prey to enemy patrols. With each shot, the unit recoils and ejects a shell casing. The shells leave a feathery vapor trail as they arc through the air. Seeing them gives you an ominous feeling, even when you are not on the receiving end.</p>
        <p>And the unit goes where it is ordered. Ground Control's ''path-finding'' -- the artificial intelligence that instructs your units how to negotiate terrain to reach a new location -- manages to carry out its tasks with realism that is impressive.</p>
        <p>When Parker was assigned to defend the approaches to a base, I broke my force into three groups and sent the personnel carrier with the weakest group. As I watched the unit move into position, I saw another climbing a hill. It moved speedily and with a smooth assurance, as though it had been born to the task, and I wondered to whom it could belong. Then I realized it was one of my units.</p>
        <p>All my units ran into trouble and were ordered to abandon the base and withdraw with any usable equipment to a pickup point to the northeast. I panicked, and rather than micro-managing the withdrawal, I just selected each unit and moved them en masse toward their destination. The amazing thing was that despite a landscape rife with nooks and crannies with the potential to ensnare units, most of them made it. As enemy units poured into the base, the tattered remnants of my forces, under a rain of fire, finally converged in a deep canyon leading to the evacuation zone.</p>
        <p>In another game, that might have been an invitation to a traffic jam. But there was no traffic jam. The units did not get lost. They did not stop in unauthorized spots. They did not behave like tourists. Instead, they rounded corners in smooth, continuous movements. They followed one another at sensible intervals, and they followed the terrain as though they knew it by heart. It made the ordinary seem elegant and elegance seem easy. I cannot think of a better definition of style.</p>
