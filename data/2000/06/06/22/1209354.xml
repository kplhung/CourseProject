        <p>A state commission investigating possible mismanagement in the New York City school system charged yesterday that the Board of Education has failed to conduct required annual safety inspections of the city's aging school buildings and has inordinately delayed the repair of hazardous conditions endangering students and teachers.</p>
        <p>In the first of two reports, the Moreland Commission on New York City Schools also said that the Board of Education's division of school facilities has repeatedly violated or ignored statutory requirements to include the public in the process of planning school construction and improvements. As a result, projects were added to or dropped from the Board of Education's capital plan in response to political whims, sometimes leaving the board unable to respond to the urgent need for school repairs, the report said.</p>
        <p>The report said the School Construction Authority -- created more than a decade ago in response to corruption and cost overruns in the board's construction division -- contributed to the failures. Nevertheless, the commission recommended that virtually all responsibilities for planning new schools and other projects be transferred from the Board of Education to the construction authority.</p>
        <p>Board of Education officials blasted the report yesterday, saying its genesis was politically motivated and its conclusions were poorly supported. The Moreland Commission has come under fire since its establishment in early 1999 by Gov. George E. Pataki. Critics argued that it was created in response to a report accusing Mr. Pataki's appointee to the construction authority, who has since resigned, of violating the authority's rules against nepotism by helping to secure a job for his secretary's husband. The husband was a supervisor at a school construction site where a student was killed by a falling brick.</p>
        <p>William C. Thompson Jr., the president of the Board of Education, said that while it was impossible for the board to ensure that every school building is 100 percent safe, every city school had been surveyed within the last year and a half. And Chancellor Harold O. Levy, who once headed a special commission investigating school facilities and is a trustee of the construction authority, said that while some of the commission's recommendations deserve further study, ''in my judgment, there is not a safety issue.''</p>
        <p>Whether the board conducts required annual safety inspections was at issue in a 1994 lawsuit filed by the United Federation of Teachers. In 1998, a state judge ordered new and continuing inspections. But the commission charged yesterday that there have been no safety inspections since 1998, when the order was issued.</p>
        <p>However, Randi Weingarten, the president of the teachers union, said yesterday that the Board of Education had complied with the court's order for regular inspections. ''They are not doing them as fastidiously as we would like, but at the same time, I have seen a real change,'' she said. ''The schools today are physically safer than when we brought the lawsuit.''</p>
        <p>The commission found that 80 percent of the new schools or school additions constructed under the most recent capital plan, which was in force from 1995 through last year, were added to the plan after it was approved, without holding public hearings or seeking prior approval of city and school officials.</p>
        <p>Roslynn R. Mauskopf, the state inspector general and the chairwoman of the commission, said that the school facilities division ''consistently and effectively silenced the voices of the community, parents and teachers'' in the planning process.</p>
        <p>But board officials said that the commission's investigation was little more than a show. Mr. Thompson and Mr. Levy noted that the commission did not interview Patricia Zedalis, chief executive of the school facilities division.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mauskopf said that the Board of Education initially fought the commission's efforts to speak with Ms. Zedalis. She agreed to be interviewed in April, when the commission had already concluded its investigation, Ms. Mauskopf said.</p>
        <p>The report relies heavily on critical comments from Milo E. Riverso, the president of the School Construction Authority, which will be the focus of the commission's next report. Since the construction authority was created, the two agencies have had an acrimonious relationship. Because legislators failed to draw clear lines of authority and accountability between the board and the authority, the two have continually battled over planning and construction issues.</p>
        <p>But yesterday the construction authority said in a statement that it ''will work with the new chancellor to address all the findings and recommendations'' in the report.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said a recommendation to clearly lay out the responsibilities between the board and the construction authority is among those that should be acted upon.</p>
