        <p>The transit workers arrived by the dozens, piling out of trucks and wearing orange vests and helmets, like soldiers ready for battle. Some had trained for exactly such a moment. Others could not have known what to expect when they stepped into the subway tunnel beneath the DeKalb Avenue station in downtown Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Billowing smoke. People stumbling around in shock. Blood and cracked windows.</p>
        <p>After the third car of a southbound B train jumped the rails just before 10 p.m. Tuesday, about 200 transit workers were called to clear the tracks for the morning commute. Some officials at New York City Transit shook their heads and said it was not possible. But the workers began hauling hydraulic jacks, welding equipment and flashlights into the tunnel.</p>
        <p>Transit officials wearing white shirts and helmets emblazoned with ''Emergency Response Team'' began directing traffic. People were ushered off the platforms and outside the station, where the police and ambulance workers began treating the injured.</p>
        <p>Jeraline Morris, who usually works nights in the ticket booth, stood outside the booth for an hour directing riders to other stations. She watched as transit officials poured in.</p>
        <p>''All of my friends were here,'' she said, ''faces I haven't seen in a long time.''</p>
        <p>By midnight, only a few riders were still going to the station. The crash site had been cleared of people. A radio dispatcher was rerouting trains to a different track.</p>
        <p>The men in the orange vests got to work.</p>
        <p>The first task was to get the eight-car train off the tracks. The second and third cars had derailed, though all the cars remained connected. The third car had plowed into a wall, and workers used a blowtorch to separate it from the second car. Sparks showered through the tunnel like a cloud of fireflies.</p>
        <p>Workers then wedged hydraulic and hand jacks beneath the derailed cars, which weigh about 37 tons each, said Melissa Farley, a transit spokeswoman. By the glow of lamps and flashlights, they moved the cars back onto the tracks sometime after 4:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>A diesel locomotive was hooked to the first two cars and dragged them to a rail yard at Coney Island, where there is a maintenance and overhaul shop. The other six cars were steered there under their own power.</p>
        <p>In the hours before dawn, the track work started. About 70 feet had been damaged. The workers cut and relaid the rails with new segments.</p>
        <p>Then they ran a test train along the new track and checked the signal switch. Everything worked.</p>
        <p>By 5:40 a.m., trains began rolling into the station again.</p>
        <p>''It was a sight to behold, to be honest with you,'' said Lawrence G. Reuter, president of New York City Transit. ''Their goal was to get trains running by the rush hour and they achieved that.''</p>
        <p>Around 6 a.m., the first commuters were straggling past police officers and into the station, laden with cups of coffee and newspapers. Some were unaware of what had taken place during the night. They stared at the dozen or so men walking up the stairs in orange vests streaked with dirt and carrying metal tools. The men squinted in the morning light.</p>
        <p>''They got it working very fast, very fast,'' said a musician, Robert Belmond, with a shake of his head as he rode the southbound D train that afternoon to the DeKalb stop. ''If it was anywhere else, they wouldn't have gotten it running this fast. I think they did good.''</p>
