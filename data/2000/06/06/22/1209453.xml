        <p>Letter by James Chafee responds to June 15 article on library computerization; says intellectual diversity comes from years of research, not from clicking on Internet search engine</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>So Web entrepreneurs are scanning a handful of public domain volumes and calling it a library. The theory is that the lazy-minded will not know the difference, and consequently real libraries are passe. But no one who has actually seen the mountain of records, archives and files that a real library contains could entertain such a notion.</p>
        <p>It is an error to think that intellectual diversity comes from having a large database. Intellectual diversity comes from having who can spend years on research and then make a living from their publishing. Writers who can challenge the assumptions of the past, go back to original documents and then write books that contribute to a new understanding our society and our history.</p>

        <p>This kind of work does not get done by clicking on a search engine, much as college freshmen would like to believe that it is so.</p>
