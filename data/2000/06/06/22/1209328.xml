        <p>Editorial scores pending measure by House Republicans to block funding for Justice Department suit against tobacco industry; holds powerful lobby has bought allegiance of some members of Congress</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Republicans in the House are engaged in a brazen effort to protect the tobacco industry from a federal lawsuit. The House is expected to vote today on an appropriations bill with a provision that would make it practically impossible for the Justice Department to finance its lawsuit against the industry. If this provision survives, Congress will have allowed a powerful lobby to stop legitimate federal litigation simply because it has bought the allegiance of some members of Congress.</p>
        <p>Justice filed a civil suit against the industry last September seeking to recover the more than $20 billion a year that the federal government spends to treat people with smoking-related diseases under Medicare and other federal programs. The suit also asks for a permanent injunction against industry deceptions about smoking's hazards. The states have already reached settlements totaling $246 billion over the next 25 years.</p>

        <p>Republicans in the House are engaged in a brazen effort to protect the tobacco industry from a federal lawsuit. The House is expected to vote today on an appropriations bill with a provision that would make it practically impossible for the Justice Department to finance its lawsuit against the industry. If this provision survives, Congress will have allowed a powerful lobby to stop legitimate federal litigation simply because it has bought the allegiance of some members of Congress.</p>
        <p>Justice filed a civil suit against the industry last September seeking to recover the more than $20 billion a year that the federal government spends to treat people with smoking-related diseases under Medicare and other federal programs. The suit also asks for a permanent injunction against industry deceptions about smoking's hazards. The states have already reached settlements totaling $246 billion over the next 25 years.</p>
        <p>Despite the billions involved, Congress refused last year to give Justice $20 million to hire lawyers and experts. But the department went forward by using $6 million from its general budget and raising nearly $8 million from other agencies that oversee the largest federal health programs.</p>
        <p>The House rejected an earlier effort to prohibit one of the agencies, the Department of Veterans Affairs, from helping to underwrite the litigation. But the House leadership does not give up easily. The Justice Department spending bill up for a vote today would prevent the department from using funds from other agencies to support lawsuits initiated by the government, including the tobacco case. This latest tactic deserves another rebuff.</p>
