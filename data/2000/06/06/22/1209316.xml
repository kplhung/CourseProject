        <p>Seventy-five percent of the world's estimated 150 million unemployed workers have no jobless benefits, and even the most generous countries have been cutting assistance to the unemployed, the International Labor Organization said today in its annual assessment of global working conditions.</p>
        <p>The authors of the report said the cutbacks represented a significant threat to economic development because they undermined the financial security of employed workers.</p>
        <p>Worker protection in today's insecure job environment is essential, said Roger Beattie, the report's chief author, ''because people who are well protected are far more willing to accept such changes.''</p>
        <p>Juan Somavia, director general of the Geneva-based I.L.O., said that recalcitrant countries could ''eventually suffer a destructive backlash.''</p>
        <p>The United Nations agency's World Labor Report 2000 said workers in Europe enjoy the most generous unemployment benefits, but even its wealthy countries reduced them in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>The United States also trimmed benefits, and has slipped in a ranking of which countries offer the most generous worker protection, the study reported. Australia, Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand and Britain also provide a lower level of benefits than countries in the top tier of the ranking.</p>
        <p>Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland make up the top-tier countries with the most benefits for the greatest number of workers.</p>
        <p>An entrenched system of benefits in much of Europe, and the resistance to efforts to pare it, have raised criticism that the European countries are too burdened with social costs to compete effectively with more free-wheeling economies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beattie rejected such criticism as ''naive'' and said that the study indicated that countries can put a secure floor under workers while still growing economically.  The I.L.O. study showed that the most generous countries, like Spain, replace 63 percent to 77 percent of wages to the unemployed. New Zealand is among the lowest, at 23 percent wage replacement. Canada and the United States provide about 58 percent replacement of wages.</p>
        <p>The two North American countries and Britain, however, also provide unemployment benefits for only 12 months, which is described as short in the report. Also, neither the United States or Canada provides a second layer of unemployment assistance when initial insurance benefits are exhausted.</p>
