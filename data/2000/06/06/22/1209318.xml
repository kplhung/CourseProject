        <p>Gov. George W. Bush chose to stay away from the state convention of the Texas Republican Party last week. If you were trying to sell yourself to American voters as a sane, moderately conservative candidate for president, you'd have stayed away, too.</p>
        <p>The rest of the nation is not nearly ready for the zany extremism of the Republican Party in Mr. Bush's home state. The convention was held in Houston, and here are just a few of the items in the platform adopted by the delegates:</p>
        <p>* The income tax and the Internal Revenue Service should be abolished.</p>
        <p>* All minimum wage laws should be repealed.</p>
        <p>* The Social Security system should be phased out entirely.</p>
        <p>* All U.S. participation in the United Nations should come to an end.</p>
        <p>* The North American Free Trade Agreement should be repealed and the United States should withdraw from the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>* The federal monetary system should return to the gold standard.</p>
        <p>They're serious. The hard right rides at a gallop in Texas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush thought it would be prudent to steer clear of Houston while the convention was under way. He spent his time traveling and raising campaign cash in New England, Ohio, Kentucky and Florida.</p>
        <p>It may be odd for a governor to skip the convention of his own state party but Republican politicians in Texas seemed to understand that the potential for embarrassment was great, and it was probably better for Mr. Bush to keep his distance.</p>
        <p>For example, even as a national controversy was developing over the planned execution of Gary Graham, the Texas Republicans asserted in their platform that ''capital punishment should be swift and unencumbered.''</p>
        <p>Another item in the platform declared that ''homosexual behavior is contrary to the fundamental unchanging truths that have been ordained by God.''</p>
        <p>The delegates would not let the Texas Log Cabin Republicans set up an information booth inside the convention hall. So the group rented a 25-foot air-conditioned van and drove it around the convention center for three days.</p>
        <p>''We got lots of claps and thumbs up,'' said Steve Labinski, the state president of the gay Republican group.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush's wife, Laura, spoke at the convention, and Mr. Bush told the delegates, in a videotaped statement: ''I really don't like missing my first Texas state Republican convention since 1990.''</p>
        <p>That may have been true. But he would have liked even less being badgered by reporters about whether he agreed with some of the wackier aspects of the convention and its platform -- and whether he would fight his party (in Texas or in Congress) whenever he held an opposing view.</p>
        <p>Governor, do you agree that we should get rid of the minimum wage? Governor, what would happen to retirees if Social Security were phased out altogether? Governor, how would the federal government be financed if we scrapped the income tax? Governor, do you think we should go back on the gold standard? Isn't that, um, a half-baked idea?</p>
        <p>Through a spokesman, the governor made it clear that he wanted nothing to do with the Texas Republican Party platform.</p>
        <p>''Let me put it this way,'' said the spokesman. ''Those interested in Governor Bush's positions and platforms should listen to Governor Bush on the campaign trail, or listen to him at the National Republican Convention this summer. He is running on his own positions and agenda items, on issues like improving education, economic opportunity and national defense.</p>
        <p>''The state party platform, which the governor was not involved in drafting, was created by approximately 8,000 delegates and should be viewed as a broad statement of philosophy. But, again, for those interested in the Bush agenda, they should pay attention to Governor Bush.''</p>
        <p>Other high-profile Texan Republicans, including Senators Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, attended the convention and made speeches. But, of course, they're not running for president.</p>
        <p>The Texas Republican who is running for president ran as far from the weirdness of his own party's convention as he could get.</p>
