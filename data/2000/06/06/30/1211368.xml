        <p>Stock prices fell broadly yesterday as several prominent companies warned of lower-than-expected profits and the government reported that the economy grew faster than originally thought in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Shares of telecommunications and computer-networking companies were among the biggest drags on the Nasdaq composite index, which pulled out of an early swoon but slid again after lunch and closed with a loss of 63.11 points, or 1.6 percent, to 3,877.23.</p>
        <p>Ericsson, the biggest maker of equipment for wireless phones, cast a pall over the market by cautioning that the industry's growth might be held back by consumer resistance to higher prices -- reflecting, among other things, government fees for licenses. Shares in the company fell 1 3/8, to 18 11/16, and Alcatel, Nokia and Qualcomm also slumped. A PaineWebber analyst cut his target price for Qualcomm to 200 over the next year from 250. Shares of Qualcomm fell 2 1/16, to 61 1/2.</p>
        <p>''Wireless is sort of polluting the environment,'' said Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell &amp; Reed.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 129.75 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,398.04, swelling the loss so far this year to 9.6 percent, about twice that of the Nasdaq. Twenty of the 30 components fell, led by J. P. Morgan and Hewlett-Packard, which each fell about 4 points.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index declined 12.43 points, or 0.85 percent, to 1,442.39, with 309 of its components lower compared with 178 that were higher. The index is down 1.83 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Inflation fears weighed on the market after the Commerce Department increased the figure for first-quarter growth in gross domestic product to 5.5 percent from 5.4 percent, adding to uneasiness that the Federal Reserve may decide to raise interest rates again when it meets in August.</p>
        <p>''There's more inflation than we thought,'' said Douglas R. Cliggott, a top strategist at J. P. Morgan.</p>
        <p>But drug stocks bucked the downtrend, paced by Eli Lilly, which soared to its biggest gain in at least 20 years after it said its experimental sepsis drug, Zovant, showed promise in reducing deaths. The stock gained 15 1/8, to 102 1/4, after trading as high as 109.</p>
        <p>Other companies that warned of lower earnings, some two dozen over the last two days, included Unisys, which tumbled 9 1/16, to 14 9/16; Goodyear Tire and Rubber, down 2 1/8, to 21 1/4; and SCM Microsystems, which dropped 35 11/16, to 53 5/8.</p>
        <p>''There's not a lot of empathy for earnings shortfalls'' said Andrew M. Brooks, chief stock trader at T. Rowe Price.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, a tabulation by I.B.E.S. International, which tracks forecasts, suggested that second-quarter profit reports over the summer would not prove disappointing over all.</p>
        <p>Just 65.8 percent of so-called pre-announcements have been negative, said Joseph S. Kalinowski, the equity strategist at I.B.E.S., compared with an average of 84 percent for the quarter since 1996. The difference, he suggested, is that this year there has been a bunching of announcements by high-profile companies.</p>
        <p>Recent weakness of the dollar against the euro and the yen, analysts said, not only may have contributed to some of the shortfalls but has added to general inflation pressure.</p>
        <p>With consumer prices other than food and energy likely to be topping 3 percent, Mr. Cliggott said, ''I think it makes sense to be pretty cautious'' about stocks.</p>
        <p>Volume on the Big Board edged up to 1.11 billion shares from 1.07 billion on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Stocks overseas were decidedly lower in most major markets -- about 3 percent in Paris, 2.5 percent in Frankfurt and Sao Paulo, and 1 percent in London and Hong Kong. Stocks rose less than 1 percent in Tokyo.</p>
