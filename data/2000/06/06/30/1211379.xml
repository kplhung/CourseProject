        <p>President Clinton nominated a former representative, Norman Y. Mineta, today as secretary of commerce for the final six months of his presidency, laying the groundwork for Mr. Mineta to become the first Asian-American to hold a Cabinet post.</p>

        <p>President Clinton nominated a former representative, Norman Y. Mineta, today as secretary of commerce for the final six months of his presidency, laying the groundwork for Mr. Mineta to become the first Asian-American to hold a Cabinet post.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mineta, a Democrat, retired from the House in 1995 after 21 years representing the area around San Jose, Calif. He had been chairman of the Public Works and Transportation Committee and resigned in 1995 to become a senior vice president at Lockheed Martin.</p>
        <p>If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Mineta would replace William M. Daley, who will formally step down on July 15 to become campaign chairman for Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid. He would be Mr. Clinton's fourth commerce secretary, following Mickey Kantor and the late Ron Brown, as well as Mr. Daley.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mineta is 68. During World War II, when he was 10, his family was loaded onto a train and taken to an internment camp in Wyoming for Americans of Japanese descent. Years later, as a lawmaker, Mr. Mineta helped pass legislation granting $20,000 in compensation to every Japanese-American who had been interned.</p>
        <p>''Norm Mineta's family story tells a lot about the promise of the American dream and the power of one person's devotion to opportunity and to justice,'' Mr. Clinton said in announcing the selection this morning in the Oval Office. Along with Mr. Mineta, the president was joined by Mr. Daley and Robert L. Mallett, the deputy commerce secretary, who had been a finalist for the top job.</p>
        <p>The nomination brought immediate praise from Asian-American organizations. One side benefit of the selection, in the view of administration officials, is that it may help blunt criticism from Asian-Americans that followed the firing of Wen Ho Lee, the government scientist accused of mishandling secrets at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Some Asian-Americans have also expressed unhappiness over the scrutiny people of Asian descent have faced during the investigations of campaign fund-raising abuses in 1996.</p>
        <p>''I think it will go a long way toward bridging the divide,'' Mr. Mineta said in an interview today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mineta acknowledged that, even with a quick confirmation, his time in Mr. Clinton's Cabinet would be short. But he said that he was not taking the job as a caretaker and that he believed the Commerce Department would remain active until the very end of the president's term.</p>
        <p>''Some might say that the months remaining in this administration is not a lot of time to make a difference in the life of our nation,'' Mr. Mineta said. ''But I disagree. Six months is a virtual eternity in the new economy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mineta's decision to leave the House to go into private business with a year to go in his term, and just 10 months after Republicans gained control of Congress, rankled some of his Democratic colleagues at the time. A Republican, Representative Tom Campbell, won Mr. Mineta's seat in a special election.</p>
        <p>Key Republican senators and supporters predicted a quick confirmation.</p>
        <p>''This is a guy who will do very well in the sprint to the end,'' said Tom Donahue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''He knows Congress well, and they know him.''</p>
        <p>Some union leaders also praised Mr. Mineta, saying their main concern was his support for the Clinton administration's free-trade agenda.</p>
        <p>Not everybody, however, was enthusiastic.</p>
        <p>''If his Congressional voting record is any measure, he's clearly out of touch with small business,'' said Nelson Litterst, a spokesman for the National Federation for Independent Business.</p>
        <p>Despite a considerable salary increase when he went into the private sector, Mr. Mineta had clearly not turned his back entirely on politics. He served as an informal adviser to Mr. Gore's presidential effort and had recently considered a run for his old seat in Congress.</p>
        <p>This was the second time Mr. Mineta had been offered a Cabinet post, he said. In 1992, President-elect Clinton considered Mr. Mineta for transportation secretary, and Mr. Mineta said today that he had been offered the job but turned it down. He was about to become a committee chairman, and thought he could assist his party more in that capacity, he said.</p>
        <p>Nearly eight years later, when another Cabinet offer came, Mr. Mineta jumped at the chance.</p>
        <p>John D. Podesta, the president's chief of staff, called Mr. Mineta last Friday to gauge his availability.</p>
        <p>''Are you interested?'' Mr. Podesta asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mineta said he responded without hesitation: ''Do you want me to crawl through the telephone line to your office right now?''</p>
