        <p>He is 6 feet 4 inches, but he may as well have been 80 feet tall last night, the way his presence loomed over the field like the billboard snaking up the light tower behind the Shea Stadium bleachers.</p>
        <p>Atlanta Braves relief pitcher John Rocker -- two years in the majors, 25 on the planet -- was the reason a combined total of more than 1,000 reporters and police officers showed up for a June ballgame. And he was the man 46,998 fans most wanted to see.</p>
        <p>The Braves took a four-run lead midway through the game -- perhaps too wide a lead for a late-inning specialist like Rocker. When Braves Manager Bobby Cox called for the rookie Jason Marquis as his first reliever, the fans chanted, ''We want Rocker!''</p>
        <p>They had seen him only on video before the game, when the Mets replayed his pregame statement in which he apologized for his offensive ranting in a December magazine article. They booed then, and they stood and shouted when Rocker bolted from the bullpen before the bottom of the eighth inning.</p>
        <p>His assignment was to protect the Braves' 6-4 lead, and as usual, Rocker sprinted in. He was leaving the sanctuary the Mets and the city had created -- a roof over the bullpen bench and mound -- and with debris pelting the field as he ran, Rocker looked like a soldier on a suicide mission through enemy territory.</p>
        <p>But he reached his destination safely, and there he won his war. As the crowd chanted at him profanely, Rocker fell behind in the count to Robin Ventura. But he came back, heaving 94-mile-an-hour fastballs that Ventura could not hit. Strikeout.</p>
        <p>Todd Zeile grounded out. So did Jay Payton. And that was that. Calmly -- and with no more objects flying toward him -- Rocker had set down the Mets' 5-6-7 hitters in order in a crucial spot. He walked off the mound slowly and slapped high-fives as he descended the steps into the third-base dugout.</p>
        <p>Kerry Ligtenberg came on to save the 6-4 Braves' victory in the ninth, and the Mets' seven-game winning streak ended. The Braves increased their lead in the National League East to three games and were assured that they would leave town Sunday in no worse than a tie for first.</p>
        <p>The Mets, who fell to the Braves in six games in last October's National League Championship Series, have now lost 19 of their last 25 regular-season games to Atlanta.</p>
        <p>The Mets were curious about how Rocker would perform in such a hostile environment. Edgardo Alfonzo said he wondered if Rocker would be wild, and Rocker was when he pitched to Ventura. Ventura admitted he probably swung at ball four when he swung on a 3-1 pitch. ''He throws hard, and that's what makes him good,'' Ventura said. ''He throws hard enough that sometimes you have to chase bad pitches.''</p>
        <p>Said Payton: ''He's been through a lot, and I think he's gained a lot of experience, just for all he's been through. He's starting to learn how to handle things. He came in very poised, and he did a good job.''</p>
        <p>The drama of Rocker's inning notwithstanding, the opener of the four-game series did not display the quality of baseball expected from the teams with the two best records in the National League.</p>
        <p>The Mets' starter, the right-hander Rick Reed, fractured his left wrist on a line drive and also strained a calf muscle. He will be placed on the disabled list today. The Braves' scheduled starter, Greg Maddux, was ill and never left the hotel. The winning team made three errors. The losing team's All-Star catcher lost track of the outs.</p>
        <p>Andres Galarraga tripled in a run in the first inning, the ball knuckling to elude a charging Payton. But Reed seemed in control after retiring the first two Braves in the third. Then Andruw Jones smacked a liner off Reed's glove that injured him and went for an infield single. Chipper Jones tripled off the right-field wall, and Galarraga followed with a 414-foot, opposite-field home run to right. The Braves were up, 4-0, and after Reed got the final out, he was through for the night, and at least for two more weeks.</p>
        <p>Maddux, the four-time Cy Young winner, was replaced by the journeyman John Burkett. He faced a lineup that included seven .300 hitters, but held the Mets hitless his first time through the order. Melvin Mora reached base on a two-out error in the third, and a walk and an infield hit loaded the bases for Mike Piazza.</p>
        <p>Piazza singled, bringing in two runs and giving him 12 games in a row with at least one run batted in. The last National Leaguer with a streak that long was the Cardinals' Rip Collins in 1935.</p>
        <p>Ventura came up next, but he struck out looking with runners at first and third, ending the inning.</p>
        <p>The score was still 4-2 in the fifth when Pat Mahomes struck out Galarraga with runners on first and second and one out. But Piazza thought it was the third out and began to walk off with the ball. Mahomes shouted at him and waved his hands, but the catcher could not hear him.</p>
        <p>Andruw Jones took third and scored the Braves' fifth run when Brain Jordan singled up the middle.</p>
        <p>''My heart was going about a million miles per hour,'' Piazza said. ''I just completely freaked out.''</p>
        <p>Many in the crowd expected Rocker to be saying the same thing after enduring their taunts. But he withstood the jeering and somehow did his job.</p>
        <p>''We want John Rocker to be effective,'' Chipper Jones said. ''In this atmosphere, that was pretty impressive.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The rehabilitation assignment of DARRYL HAMILTON lasted just one day. The Mets outfielder went 1 for 3 as the designated hitter for Class A St. Lucie on Wednesday, then said his toe was hurting. He will travel to California to meet with the doctor who performed surgery on the toe. . . . JASON MARQUIS, a 21-year-old rookie from Tottenville High School on Staten Island, pitched two good innings in relief for the Braves last night. Marquis was called up to the Braves when JOHN ROCKER was briefly sent to the minors.</p>
