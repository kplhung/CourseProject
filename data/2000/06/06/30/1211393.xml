        <p>SO they gave one last decent Broadway gala to bid farewell to the theater season, and Aubrey Reuben was there, as ever, with his Canon Sure Shot 120, as ever, blasting cold flash right into the eyes of celebrities.</p>
        <p>Neil Simon? Snap. Nathan Lane? Snap. Marsha Mason? Snap. Robert Klein? Snap. Charles S. Dutton? Snap. Calista Flockhart? Snap.</p>
        <p>''All right, O.K.,'' Mr. Reuben said, eyeing the dinner crowd the other night at the Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS fund-raiser honoring Mr. Simon. ''Now on to what's really important -- the food and the wine!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reuben, in his trademark gray Ralph Lauren suit and floral tie, has been called a ''gentleman paparazzo'' but rejects that. ''I don't take pictures of people without their permission,'' he said. ''I don't stake out homes or hotels. I don't shoot into people's windows.''</p>
        <p>What then would be your job description, Mr. Reuben? ''Celebrity photographer,'' he replied.</p>
        <p>But suddenly Aubrey Reuben, observer, is the thing observed. Or as Bill Evans, the press representative for the Neil Simon event, put it: ''It's always been good to see Aubrey, but now we really have to play up to him.''</p>
        <p>The reason is that Mr. Reuben was recently named to the prestigious  nominating committee for next season's Tony Awards, one of only 30 chosen. ''I take it very seriously,'' Mr. Reuben said. ''It's a great honor. The theater is literally my life.'' Pause. ''I even adore the ushers.''</p>
        <p>True, some in the ever-treacherous theater business have reacted to the news as if the scullery maid was named sous-chef. But his new liege defends him. ''Aubrey is eminently qualified, as a lover of the theater who has seen every show for years and years,'' said Roy A. Somlyo, president of the American Theater Wing, which founded the Tonys in 1947.</p>
        <p>But really, Mr. Somlyo -- a celebrity photographer? ''I don't think that in any way demeans the Tony process,'' Mr. Somlyo said. ''It would be wrong for the committee to be an elitist group.''</p>
        <p>Good enough. But how, oh how, to present Mr. Reuben in full? Is it Mr. Reuben the gala-seeking missile, who has ''never been to a party I didn't like,'' as he puts it? Is it Mr. Reuben the indefatigable, who has snapped as many as eight events in an evening while consuming untold merlots before having an Irish coffee at 2 a.m. at Rosie O'Grady's, the saloon?</p>
        <p>Or is the real Mr. Reuben the avuncular Broadway historian, the going-out guide who for decades has written about theater, opera and ballet for Temas, the Spanish-language magazine -- the Mr. Reuben who has for 20 years served on the executive committee of the 70-member Outer Critics Circle?</p>
        <p>Compounding the identity anomaly is the little-known public-school thing. Mr. Reuben began as a teacher of Spanish in New York City schools in 1957 and retired as assistant principal of John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens, in 1987. Along the way, he arranged for discount Broadway tickets for his classes and invited show-business luminaries to lecture in his schools.</p>
        <p>MR. REUBEN began his shutterbug career ''as a groupie with a box camera,'' he said, flashing snaps backstage after seeing shows he covered for Temas. But the early 1980's brought ''the revelation that I could be paid for this'' when his first picture appeared in The New York Post.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Reuben ''first showed up around the edges, he wasn't taken all that seriously,'' Mr. Evans said. But now Mr. Reuben is absolutely beset by what one might call event-faxation -- his number is on press agents' automatic-send list. And his snaps appear, among many other places, in The Post, where he is paid a retainer; an agency also beams his pictures to newspapers and magazines around the world. Mr. Reuben has had such world coups as the cover of People magazine (Bess Myerson and Carl A. Capasso in a smoochy condition). Giant scoops can earn him more than $20,000 a snap.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reuben steadfastly maintains that he is 33 years old (he is 68). ''I qualify for the Guinness Book of World Records because I'm the only 33-year-old father whose son is 42 years old,'' he says proudly. The son, David, teaches on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reuben stubbornly inflicts his English accent on America though he came to New York at age 15 from his native English city, Manchester,  (to join his sister, a G.I. bride) and is now a citizen.</p>
        <p>Even without his photographic royalties, Mr. Reuben says he is comfortably off, thanks to pensions and the investments he made with his wife of 39 years, Maria Elena, who died five years ago.</p>
        <p>He makes zero claim to photographic expertise. ''I have not the slightest idea of how a camera works, and all I know about film is that it has numbers on it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Then what is his definition of an artistically excellent photo? ''The picture editor likes it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What are the crucial aesthetic elements of composition? ''Deep cleavage is a decided plus,'' he said. ''If it's the scandal of the moment, that doesn't hurt.''</p>
        <p>Have his snaps ever attained the level of art?</p>
        <p>Mr. Reuben exploded in his life-of-the-party bray. ''Next question!''</p>
        <p>And how many nights a year does he go out? Three hundred sixty-five, he says. ''I love leap years, because then I'm out 366.''</p>
