        <p>Even though Emma Lazarus described her in terms worthy of a fairy-tale character -- ''I lift my lamp beside the golden door!'' -- the Statue of Liberty still doesn't immediately come to mind as a prospective heroine for a picture book.</p>
        <p>She seemed just right, however, to Lynn Curlee, who recently published ''Liberty'' (Atheneum, $18), a biography for 7- to 12-year-olds that reveals the flesh-and-blood realities behind the creation of the copper-and-iron lady. Mr. Curlee, who also painted the book's lavish illustrations, will sign copies, answer questions and discuss the symbol's past today at -- where else? -- the Statue of Liberty.</p>

        <p>Even though Emma Lazarus described her in terms worthy of a fairy-tale character -- ''I lift my lamp beside the golden door!'' -- the Statue of Liberty still doesn't immediately come to mind as a prospective heroine for a picture book.</p>
        <p>She seemed just right, however, to Lynn Curlee, who recently published ''Liberty'' (Atheneum, $18), a biography for 7- to 12-year-olds that reveals the flesh-and-blood realities behind the creation of the copper-and-iron lady. Mr. Curlee, who also painted the book's lavish illustrations, will sign copies, answer questions and discuss the symbol's past today at -- where else? -- the Statue of Liberty.</p>
        <p>''I hold up a copy of the book and say that it is about exactly the size of the statue's pinky fingernail,'' Mr. Curlee said, ''so they can see the scale. Kids always go, 'Wow!' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Curlee also plans to offer anecdotes, like the rumor that the sculptor, Auguste Bartholdi, used his mother as the model for the face and the fact that the arm holding the torch was completed first and exhibited in the United States to raise money for the project.</p>
        <p>Young history buffs may be interested to hear that there were protesters at the 1886 unveiling: suffragists. Didn't male politicians see anything odd, they wondered, in erecting a female figure as a symbol of liberty for a nation whose women couldn't vote?</p>
        <p>''It's hard to believe that the only women invited were the wives of French officials,'' Mr. Curlee added.</p>
        <p>As long as supplies last, each child at the event will receive a poster featuring the book's cover illustration, but with different wording. At the top is the phrase ''Be Free,'' and at the bottom a reminder of an all-important key to liberty: ''Read.''</p>
        <p>Book signing and talk, today from noon to 2 p.m. at the Statue of Liberty Gift Center, Liberty Island, New York Harbor, (212) 363-3180. Free.</p>
        <p>A 90's Fourth</p>
        <p>It may seem a bit early to be nostalgic for the 90's. Still, nothing will look too familiar on Tuesday at Van Cortlandt Manor, an estate in the Hudson River Valley. The decade to be recreated there is not the recent one, but the period reflected by the house: just over 200 years ago.</p>
        <p>The manor's 1790 Fourth of July will start with a bang -- a cannon firing -- followed by a puppet show, a parade, speeches and revelry.</p>
        <p>The puppet show, at 1 and 3 p.m., will be ''Punch Van Winkle,'' a version of ''Rip Van Winkle'' to be performed by Fred Greenspan. ''The story is perfect for this event,'' said Margaret L. Vetare, the site director, ''because Rip fell asleep when we were still a colony and woke up when we were a new nation.''</p>
        <p>To help foster the Revolutionary spirit, staff members will teach children how to make paper hats: a tricorner, a mobcap or one of their own design. They will be invited to wear them in the 2 p.m. parade, which adults may join, too. ''We try to enlist people's help carrying banners and swelling our ranks,'' Ms. Vetare said.</p>
        <p>If you think you've heard enough election-year orations, she promises that the ones here won't be boring. First, John Fox, an actor, will portray Philip Van Cortlandt, the son of the estate's founder and a former Revolutionary officer, and read the Declaration of Independence.</p>
        <p>At the end of the parade, he will deliver a 1790's speech that may evoke contemporary concerns. ''It asks if people are allowing partisan politics to get in the way of the good of the country,'' Ms. Vetare said.</p>
        <p>In addition to trying period dances and games, families can sing an 18th-century ballad whose music is the same as the national anthem's.</p>
        <p>''It was a very old tune, with all kinds of lyrics, ranging from patriotic to very bawdy,'' Ms. Vetare said. Needless to say, Tuesday's version will praise only the body politic.</p>
        <p>Fourth of July Celebration, Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Van Cortlandt Manor, South Riverside Avenue, Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., (914) 271-8981. Admission: $8; the elderly, $7; ages 5 to 17, $4; under 5 and members, free.</p>
        <p>Star-Crossed Species</p>
        <p>Shakespeare's characters have been portrayed in a variety of unusual ways, from a nude Lady Macbeth to Hamlets in business suits. But it's probably safe to say that no one has yet presented ''Romeo and Juliet'' as it will be performed in the Bronx this weekend: with a rodent Romeo and a many-legged Juliet.</p>
        <p>The show is a shadow puppet play, ''Romeo Perez and Julieta Martinez: A Caribbean Folk Tale With a Near-Tragic Twist,'' and will be presented at Wave Hill, the public garden. Jorge Crespo, the playwright and performer, combined Shakespeare with a traditional story about Cucaracha Martinez, a sought-after damsel, and Ratoncito Perez, the mouse who pleases her because, of all her suitors, he alone has a soft voice. (Apparently what is squeaky to humans is music to a cockroach.)</p>
        <p>The plot involves ''two little families in houses on stilts in the Caribbean,'' Mr. Crespo said. ''They quarrel over the crumbs that fall from the table. When the kids fall in love, they kind of have to get together.''</p>
        <p>After the play, which ends much more happily than Shakespeare's, the young audience members will look for insects in the garden. Then, with Mr. Crespo's help, they will create their own shadow puppets.</p>
        <p>''We'll also have an overhead projector set up with a screen,'' Mr. Crespo said. The idea is to let the puppeteers try out their stories -- perhaps something like ''Julius Centipede'' or ''MacBug.''</p>
        <p>Family performance and art project, tomorrow and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. at the Kerlin Learning Center, Wave Hill, West 249th Street and Independence Avenue, Riverdale, the Bronx, (718) 549-3200. Free with admission: $4; the elderly and students, $2; under 6, free.</p>
