        <p>The United Nations' prediction this week that about half of all 15-year-olds in AIDS-plagued African countries will eventually die of AIDS is the latest measure of the devastating impact of the epidemic on the African continent.

        <p>The United Nations' prediction this week that about half of all 15-year-olds in AIDS-plagued African countries will eventually die of AIDS is the latest measure of the devastating impact of the epidemic on the African continent. It is difficult to imagine what kind of future may be in store for countries if half of their adult populations will have died of the disease within coming decades.</p>
        <p>There are 16 African countries with critical infection levels. This is a true emergency that requires vigorous action by the countries affected and a greater flow of international aid and expertise from the industrialized nations. Although American aid has been increasing and some drug companies have slashed their prices for AIDS drugs, more money is needed to buy medicine, build up medical facilities and conduct research. But the most immediate need is education and prevention programs, which are severely lacking in countries like Botswana where stereotypes and misinformation about AIDS facilitate its spread. Unaids has reported considerable success in Uganda and Senegal, where advertising campaigns and educational efforts have lowered infection rates. The key to such improvements is recognition by the African governments that the AIDS crisis is a priority. Domestic commitment and international support are critical to saving Africa's next generation.</p>
