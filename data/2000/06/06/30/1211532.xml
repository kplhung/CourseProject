        <p>Here is a selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>KANE ALEXANDER, Firebird Cafe, 363 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 586-0244. This fresh-faced 23-year-old Australian, an alumnus of a homegrown production of ''Les Miserables,'' is a poised, charming, raven-haired Ken doll with a real singing voice. A protege of Les Solomon, the same impresario who introduced David Campbell, Mr. Alexander blends American and Australian show tunes into an autobiographical odyssey that carries him from a tiny village in the Outback to New York City. As ingenuous as he may appear, his interpretations are tasteful and intelligently conceived. Tomorrow at 9 and 11 p.m. Cover: $25; $15 minimum. Also at the Firebird, tonight at 9, David Gurland, singer; at 11, Chris Coleman, singer. Cover: $20; $15 minimum.</p>

        <p>KANE ALEXANDER, Firebird Cafe, 363 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 586-0244. This fresh-faced 23-year-old Australian, an alumnus of a homegrown production of ''Les Miserables,'' is a poised, charming, raven-haired Ken doll with a real singing voice.

Also at the Firebird, tonight at 9, David Gurland, singer; at 11, Chris Coleman, singer. Cover: $20; $15 minimum.</p>
        <p>BARBARA CARROLL, Bemelmans Bar, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. This agelessly chic red-haired pianist and singer seems to know every important popular song ever written and to be able to perform from memory in any key. Her elegant, lyrical pianism is a compendium of 20th-century jazz styles, from Count Basie to Erroll Garner to Bill Evans and beyond. And her clipped, understated vocals, which verge on speech-song, approach lyrics from a wry but warmhearted point of view. Through July 22. Tuesday through Saturday nights, beginning at 9:30. From 5:30 to 8, Michael Devine. No cover for early show; cover for late show: $15. No minimum; $5 cover at the bar.</p>
        <p>* HOWARD FISHMAN QUARTET, Sardi's, 234 West 44th Street, (212) 221-8440. Powerful echoes of Stephane Grappelli and Bix Beiderbecke are among the influences rippling through the Howard Fishman Quartet's seamless swing. The group -- Mr. Fishman on guitar, banjo and vocals; Russell Farhang playing virtuosic Grappelli-style violin; Peter Ecklund on cornet; Andrew Hall on bass -- folds elements of vintage jazz, swing and early bluegrass into rhythmically animated, richly allusive jazz chamber music. Whether the music is Stephen Foster (a bubbly ''Old Folks at Home''), Gershwin (''Soon'') or Romberg (''When I Grow Too Old to Dream''), it is all translated into lilting, fine-tuned ensemble music that transcends time and idiom. Fridays at 10:30 p.m. No cover charge, but $15 minimum at tables.</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Blue Angel Theater, 323 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes, which focuses on what Mr. Comstock calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, a creamy baritone who echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock concentrates on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves that there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Tonight, tomorrow, Monday and Thursday at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m.; Wednesday at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50 and $55 (premium ringside seating, $75 and $80).</p>
