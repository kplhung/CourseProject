        <p>After he stalked off the mound in the third inning last night, Rick Reed shoved over cups of water, punched a padded seat in the dugout and barreled into a water cooler. But all the damage he did was with his right hand, shielding his left arm from the carnage. It was an odd move for a pitcher, using his pitching hand to strike the blows, but for Reed, his left hand was already too sore for any more blows.</p>
        <p>Reed was struck by a line drive in the third inning off the bat of Andruw Jones, the ball disappearing in a white advertising sign behind the plate and not being sighted by Reed until it was just in front of his face. The ball hit him on the left wrist, fracturing the periform bone. The injury, coupled with an aggravation of a sore calf muscle that had him limping off the field at one point, ended Reed's night early, sending him onto the disabled list and to Manhattan's Hospital for Special Surgery today.</p>
        <p>It was another blow in a series of oddly uncharacteristic injuries for a pitcher. Reed has avoided the typical pitcher's woes -- the rotator cuff damage or elbow soreness -- and instead has been sidelined by bruises and tears that might better suit a quarterback.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to describe,'' Reed said, sitting glumly in front of his locker after the game with his left wrist already encased in a hard cast. ''I've tried to bust my butt, work hard, and get prepared for my turn in the rotation. It's been the wrist. It's been the calf. It's been a stiff neck. It's been this and that, little nagging things. I guess this is the icing on the cake.''</p>
        <p>The pain in his wrist and calf were not what had Reed toppling items in the dugout though. He had struggled through his three-inning stint, giving up four earned runs, five hits and two walks. In the third inning, two batters after being hit by Jones's drive, he surrendered a two-out, three-run home run to Andres Galarraga and the Mets were never able to overcome the deficit, falling 6-4 to the Braves in the opening game of the four-game set at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>''When it happened, I just blocked all the pain out,'' Reed said, referring to the line drive. ''I was sitting on the bench and it started throbbing a little bit and I looked at it and it was pretty swollen.''</p>
        <p>He said he called the team's trainer, Fred Hina, over ''and they made the decision that I wasn't going to go anymore. We took a couple of X-rays and they found out it was a break.''</p>
        <p>Mets General Manager Steve Phillips added: ''He's got a fracture of one of the eight bones in his wrist. He's going to see a hand specialist tomorrow. That coupled with the strained calf and he's going on the d.l. I don't know how long he's going to be out. The hand will be the thing that dictates that.''</p>
        <p>Reed began the season with four consecutive starts in which he was the Mets' best pitcher, allowing just three earned runs in 29 2/3 innings. But in that fourth start, he took a line drive by Marquis Grissom off his left hand, suffering a bruised left hand and a sprained right wrist. He missed one start, and although he won his next start, he gave up six runs. Then came a string of seven starts without a victory and he left a game on May 27 with a strained left oblique muscle, which again led to a missed start.</p>
        <p>Last season, Reed was also plagued by an odd assortment of injuries, enduring two stays on the disabled list with a slight tear to his calf muscle in April and then a strained middle finger on his right hand in August.</p>
        <p>But this latest injury was particularly frustrating because Reed felt that the advertising sign behind the plate had caused him to lose sight of the ball momentarily.</p>
        <p>''I know that there's been a couple of pitchers complaining about the signs back there, too,'' Reed said. ''I was a little mad about that. That's ridiculous having a white sign.''</p>
        <p>Phillips added: ''I'll talk to him about it. I guess if the white sign has something to do with it, I'll talk to whomever is in charge of the white sign.''</p>
        <p>Now, the Mets must consider how to fill the spot vacated by Reed. He will miss at least one start, but the Mets are hoping that is all it will be because of the gap provided by the All-Star Game break. The likely candidates to replace Reed are Pat Mahomes, who relieved Reed last night and has already had three emergency starts this season, or possibly a call-up from Class AAA Norfolk -- either Grant Roberts or Bobby M. Jones.</p>
        <p>However, it is also possible that if Reed's injury proves more problematic, the Mets will intensify their search for a starting pitcher on another team. They had recently indicated some interest in Baltimore's Scott Erickson, and conceivably will look his way again.</p>
