        <p>Many of the names for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination have been circulating for months: Senator Bob Graham of Florida, Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina.</p>
        <p>But such is the state of the hunt for a vice president for the vice president that no name on the Democratic side has yet so distinguished itself that it lifts up hearts and wipes others off the screen.</p>
        <p>Hence, with less than six weeks before the Democratic convention, new names, maybe preposterous names, are slipping into the void. What about Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary? Or, in the latest musing, what about Tom Brokaw, the NBC News anchorman?</p>
        <p>Advisers to Vice President Al Gore insist that no one knows anything. But the Gore camp is coming to believe that it needs to do something dramatic to catch imaginations, especially since Gov. George W. Bush, who holds a strong lead in most polls, will probably be riding pretty high when he comes out of the Republican convention with his own running mate two weeks earlier.</p>
        <p>The media attention has seemed to focus more on the Republican side, in part because Mr. Bush is gabbier than Mr. Gore, his convention is sooner and he seems to have more choices.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Gore is to be taken at his word, he is under the same time constraints as Mr. Bush. He told reporters in late April that his choice would not be dictated by Mr. Bush's choice and that he expected to make his selection by the time the Republicans gather in Philadelphia, at the end of July, even though the Democratic convention is two weeks later.</p>
        <p>''The conventions are so close together,'' Mr. Gore said at the time, that whether his choice is actually announced or not, ''it will be effectively made before then.''</p>
        <p>The tight-lipped Mr. Gore has said little publicly since then, except to note that his top criterion was whether the person could take over immediately as president and that he would obviously want to pick someone with whom he was personally comfortable. (''No, I'm going to pick someone I can't stand!'' he joked recently when asked, as he is endlessly, whether personal chemistry was important.)</p>
        <p>From all signs, Mr. Gore is replicating the selection process that was used by Bill Clinton. He has put the same super-discreet person, Warren Christopher, in charge of the search. And he is hoping for the same kind of spontaneous combustion that took place when Mr. Gore himself was chosen by Bill Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who in 1992 had been dragging in the polls behind President Bush and was even running third behind Ross Perot, announced Mr. Gore as his vice-presidential running mate four days before the convention. Mr. Clinton was suddenly catapulted to first place and never looked back.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's had not been among the names mentioned in advance, and it is quite possible that Mr. Gore's ultimate choice will not be among those mentioned now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, unlike Mr. Bush, has not really flirted publicly with any of his possible choices. Mr. Bush seems to be amused by the game, while Mr. Gore does nothing to encourage speculation about anyone.</p>
        <p>One of the considerations for Mr. Gore at this point is whether to go with a regional candidate to nail down a particular state or whether to go with a bigger-picture candidate to generate more national excitement and make a broader appeal.</p>
        <p>In the first category would be someone like Senator Graham to make a claim on Florida or Governor Gray Davis to nail down California or Senator Richard J. Durbin to make a statement in Illinois.</p>
        <p>In the second would be someone like Mr. Rubin, who would send a signal that a seasoned financial expert would be minding the store. A big subject of debate in Democratic circles is what kind of candidate Mr. Rubin, who has never run for office, might make and whether his lack of expertise in other realms would matter. He has appeared numerous times with Mr. Gore on the campaign trail, but rarely to scintillating effect. Others say that his financial experience is such a plus, who cares?</p>
        <p>And there is a third category -- someone who might help capture a particular kind of voter, not one based on region. This would include Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who might help Mr. Gore improve his standing with organized labor and neutralize the effect of Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate who threatens to undermine Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>And what of Mr. Brokaw? One top Republican burst out laughing at the mention of his name. The reason? ''The first rule of picking a running mate is to do no harm,'' this Republican said. ''The second is, don't overshadow your nominee. What he would be telling the country is, 'I can't do this on my own. I have to bring in an absolute superstar from outside government to prop myself up.' ''</p>
        <p>One person who is enjoying watching the process is Neil Oxman, a Democratic consultant based in Philadelphia and Mr. Gore's media adviser in 1988. He said that while he had no specific knowledge of this year's process, a very complex polling process was almost certainly going on beneath the surface, one that would consume perhaps $400,000 over the next few weeks as people close to Mr. Gore conducted focus groups across the country.</p>
        <p>For example, he said, pollsters were likely showing voters in Indiana relatively neutral interviews with Senator Bayh and then asking if his presence on the ticket would make them more likely or less likely to vote for Mr. Gore. They would ask the same question in media markets close to Indiana, he said, but then, the farther away from Indiana they got, they would ask more generic questions -- what is known in the trade as ''Candidate A'' questions.</p>
        <p>These are along the lines of, how would you feel about Candidate A, who has been the governor of a Midwest state and who has not raised taxes and is now a senator? If reactions to these questions are positive, Mr. Oxman said, the campaign could believe that Mr. Bayh could be a good choice.</p>
        <p>''It's all about marketing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One Republican who is close to the Bush campaign said it was clear, in any case, that Mr. Gore needed to do something dramatic to shake up the race. So who would he pick if he were Mr. Gore? He thought for a moment and said the most dramatic name he could think of: ''Bill Clinton.''</p>
