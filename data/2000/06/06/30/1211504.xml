        <p>1. Aquagrill</p>

        <p>It seems like a comfortable, pleasant neighborhood spot with Mom in the dining room and Pop in the kitchen. But behind the friendly facade is an ambitious, refreshingly original seafood menu. The wonderfully diverse raw bar is enticing, and the menu has so many seductive choices that decisions can be difficult.</p>
        <p>The appetizers, like peppered tuna carpaccio with avocado, lemon and roasted Bermuda onion; and warm octopus salad with roasted peppers and peppercress, are all excellent. The fine main courses range from the complex (grilled salmon with a falafel crust, perched on a bed of hummus with a lemon-coriander vinaigrette) to the simple (plain fish, perfectly grilled, roasted or poached).</p>
        <p>The wine list is well chosen and varied, with an eye both to value and to the food.</p>
        <p>2. Atlantic Grill</p>
        <p>* [1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 988-9200</p>
        <p>1341 Third Avenue, near 77th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This sibling of Blue Water Grill and Ocean Grill has enough of an Asian accent to make you wonder why it was named for the East Coast ocean. At a small sushi bar near the back of the dining room, two chefs frantically try to satisfy the neighborhood appetite for raw fish.</p>
        <p>They turn out interesting maki rolls, but be warned: the sushi can be very slow. If you order it as a first course, your dinner could stretch on for hours.</p>
        <p>Other Asian dishes include glazed mahi-mahi with lobster and sweet corn ragout served with a ginger citrus sauce, and nori-wrapped tuna with vegetable stir-fry and sticky rice served with wasabi soy vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>If Asian food doesn't thrill you, don't despair. The menu also includes a raw bar and hits from the other Grills: chopped salads, crab cakes, lobster and a large variety of grilled fish.</p>
        <p>3. Blue Ribbon</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 274-0404</p>
        <p>97 Sullivan Street</p>
        <p>SoHo</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Blue Ribbon, where dinner is served until 4 A.M. Tuesdays through Sundays, has become known as a chefs' after-hours hangout, and you can bet that chefs don't choose a place where the food is dull. The menu is eclectic and original, with dishes like fried chicken, paella, sweetbreads and matzo ball soup coexisting. The food is delicious, and the raw bar is terrific. Don't worry about getting sleepy; the dining room is as loud as an alarm clock.</p>
        <p>4. Bongo</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 947-3654</p>
        <p>299 10th Avenue, near 27th Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Bongo serves half a dozen kinds of oysters, changing daily, from Fanny Bays, which have a flavor shockingly like cucumbers, to Pemaquids, which are impressively salty, to Wellfleets, which have a pronounced mineral tang. Whatever the variety, the oysters at Bongo are always impeccably fresh and gloriously sensuous. The decadent allure of the oysters makes an amusing contrast to the suburban 20th-century-modern style of the room, one of the new class of lounge-restaurants in which one doesn't eat a meal so much as stylishly nibble through a couple of hours of cocktails. Aside from the oysters, the limited menu has a few other highlights, like wonderful, meaty lobster rolls served on crustless hot dog buns grilled in butter with sweet coleslaw; shrimp salad rolls; and an excellent smoked trout salad.</p>
        <p>5. City Hall</p>
        <p>** [2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 227-7777</p>
        <p>131 Duane Street</p>
        <p>TriBeCa</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Henry Meer, the chef and owner of Cub Room, created City Hall as a homage to old New York, setting picturesque photographs all around the big, open casual room. The food, which consists mainly of straightforward preparations like platters of raw shellfish, pan roasts, grilled fish, steaks and chops, seems right for former times but also perfectly appropriate for today. You can sit at the handsome bar and order from the informal menu of burgers and shellfish or from the main menu, which includes delectable fried oysters and a fabulous grilled pompano served whole, dressed with nothing but a squeeze of lemon, or simply sit and enjoy the oysters at the raw bar. The wine list is interesting and unusual.</p>
        <p>6. Esca</p>
        <p>** [2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 564-7272</p>
        <p>402 West 43rd Street</p>
        <p>Clinton</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>In a city that has seen seafood in every possible form, it takes a little ingenuity to make the idea of fish seem fresh. Esca pulls off the trick by giving the food a regional Italian focus. Esca, which is Italian for bait, draws on the rich maritime cuisine of Naples and the Amalfi coast. It also borrows a little from Istria on the northern Adriatic, in a menu-within-a-menu of raw fish served with fragrant olive oil, herbs and vegetables. Firm slices of gope, a sardinelike fish, are paired with tiny bitter greens and slivers of preserved lemon from Sorrento; weakfish with pea shoots and mint; and fluke with radishes and sea beans. After fish and fish, there's more fish. Fritto misto Amalfi-style and zuppa de pesce lead the list of highly traditional main courses, which include shrimp with arugula and artichoke salad, and a simple branzino, or Mediterranean sea bass, baked with pungently winey olives and drizzled with Italian olive oil. Lamb and chicken are on the menu. But would anyone skip Dover sole in almond pesto to get to them?</p>
        <p>7. Lenox Room</p>
        <p>** [2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 772-0404</p>
        <p>1278 Third Avenue, near 73rd Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Lenox Room's easy, fashionable atmosphere of Upper East Side elegance makes it a fitting place to enjoy life's luxuries, like a one-ounce serving of osetra. If this merely whets your appetite for extravagance, the raw bar has such treats as half a cold lobster, steamed jumbo shrimp, clams and oysters, of course. Otherwise, the modern American menu includes dishes like lobster cobb salad, roasted free-range chicken and a selection of pretty desserts.</p>
        <p>8. Markt</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 727-3314</p>
        <p>401 West 14th Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Markt's look is all brasserie, with dark wood, etched glass and vintage beer posters. Belgian beers, 29 of them, are the focus here. Mussels and other seafood, with frites, of course, are among the Belgian specialties by the chef, Marvin James, formerly of Gotham Bar and Grill. Other entrees include steak tartare, Belgian beef stew and sauteed loin of lamb with roasted Belgian endive, wild mushrooms and thyme. Markt's raw bar features at least 10 kinds of oysters every day, as well as lobster, sea whelks, sea urchins, clams, periwinkles and stone crab claws from Florida.</p>
        <p>9. Ocean Grill</p>
        <p>* [1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 579-2300</p>
        <p>384 Columbus Avenue, near 78th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The room is big and attractively understated, with a raw bar in front and a boisterous clientele. The raw bar menu has four types of oysters that change daily, caviar, littleneck or cherrystone clams, shrimp and lobster cocktails. The main menu includes crab cakes that are crisp and plump and served with a fine roasted corn salsa and a roasted red chile basil sauce; and seafood cioppino with shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels, calamari and sea bass. The grilled fish are all nicely handled, and the French fries are excellent and even the hamburger is good.</p>
        <p>10. Pearl Oyster Bar</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 691-8211</p>
        <p>18 Cornelia Street</p>
        <p>Greenwich Village</p>
        <p>$ Mastercard and Visa</p>
        <p>It's just a marble counter with a few small tables, and it barely holds 25 people, but Pearl Oyster Bar has won a large following with its casual charm and Maine-inspired seafood. Start with the oysters, of course, but look for the more delicate varieties rather than the occasionally behemoth bluepoints. Lobster rolls are meaty and delicious, and chowder is made with smoked bacon and clams. The chefs and owners, Rebecca Charles and Mary Redding, have a way with whole fish, particularly sweet, delicate pompano grilled until the edges turn into a herbal crust. The short wine list is smart and inexpensive.</p>
        <p>11. Shaffer City Oyster Bar and Grill</p>
        <p>++</p>
        <p>(212) 255-9827</p>
        <p>5 West 21st Street</p>
        <p>Flatiron district</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Although the tiled room is casual and the service even more so, the Shaffer City Oyster Bar and Grill is very appealing. The room has the easy feel of an old-time oyster saloon, and oysters are, in fact, particularly good, whether raw, or fried and served with sauteed spinach and chipotle aioli. Shaffer City offers one of the largest selections of oysters in the city with 32 to 40 varieties available. The menu also includes enjoyable herb-crusted, pan-seared halibut with wilted greens, red pepper mashed potatoes and spicy tomato coulis, and lobster dumplings with a spicy coconut-basil Thai sauce. Shaffer City doesn't seem like the sort of place to spend much energy on dessert, but the ice cream sandwich with fruit is light and attractive and makes a pleasant ending to a meal.</p>
