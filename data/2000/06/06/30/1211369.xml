        <p>Some people might scratch their heads at what Richard G. Hendrickson has been up to for the last 70 years. Even he seems a little mystified, trying to explain it.</p>
        <p>Since 1930, when he was an 18-year-old rawboned kid growing up on a small poultry and dairy farm on the eastern tip of Long Island, he has gone out into his yard at least twice a day, in every sort of weather, to record the temperature and precipitation and wind velocity as a volunteer for the National Weather Service.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hendrickson is the longest-serving volunteer east of the Mississippi, and on July 1, when he formally crosses the 70-year threshold, Mr. Hendrickson will join an elite, if obscure, fraternity of only six people in the 110-year history of the Cooperative Weather Observer Program who have served the Weather Service into an eighth decade.</p>
        <p>''Farming is drudgery, seven days a week,'' said Mr. Hendrickson, who sold his farm only last year at the age of 87. ''You've got to do things that are different, to stay you from going nuts.''</p>
        <p>There is a bit more to the story than that, of course. Behind Mr. Hendrickson's meticulous weather monitoring was a rapturous love affair -- with the sky and with nature. Also playing a part was an eccentric writer with a passion for meteorology who moved in near the farm when Mr. Hendrickson was an impressionable teenager in the 1920's.</p>
        <p>And last, there is a certain harder-to-define essence that has informed Mr. Hendrickson's life, a spirit that seems almost jarring today in its tough-minded, Old World code: duty. Mr. Hendrickson measured the weather as a way of serving his country.</p>
        <p>''He's an extremely 19th-century man, and I mean that as a compliment,'' said his son, Richard H. Hendrickson. ''He was raised in a farming environment in the teens and 20's, being responsible 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, for the animals and crops. Built into his very nature is the concept of responsibility; it's the fiber of his being.''</p>
        <p>''It creates a dedication to consistency, like perfect attendance at school,'' Mr. Hendrickson added. ''It's strange, but it's worthy of great respect.''</p>
        <p>The Cooperative Weather Observer Program was inspired by the writings of Thomas Jefferson, who was something of a weather nut himself. Jefferson envisioned a republic of yeoman farmers, all gathering and sharing agricultural data about storms and the dates of the first and last frosts, all for the good of the country.</p>
        <p>But that mix of weather and patriotism, not to mention family farming, has faded. People want to get paid these days, or they do not stay in one place long enough to allow for a continuity of data, say weather officials who are struggling in many parts of the country to keep the old stations afloat.</p>
        <p>Nationally, the number of observers has declined from its peak in 1970, when there were 13,500, to only 11,700 today, and many of the stations are becoming automated.</p>
        <p>But there are also many holdouts like Mr. Hendrickson who refuse to come in from the cold. A volunteer in Wyoming, the reigning longevity champion, has taken readings for just over 70 years. A weather observer in Brooklyn, Frank Martino, recently passed his 50-year anniversary. The national record is held by Earl Stewart of Cottage Grove, Ore., who took weather observations every day for 77 years, from 1917 to 1994.</p>
        <p>''These folks just love serving their country, and thank God there's still people like that around,'' said Robert J. Leffler, the manager of the cooperative observer program at the National Weather Service.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hendrickson, who still chops his own firewood and still finds the time to lie outside on the grass most evenings with his wife, Lillian, to look at the sky, says he never missed a day's weather reading in all his decades. Whenever he could not be there personally -- a cumulative total of only a couple of hundred times over the more than 25,500 days of his observation career -- he found a substitute, usually his father, or later his son, to ''take the weather.''</p>
        <p>The younger Mr. Hendrickson, who is 60, lives nearby. He has agreed to take over the station permanently whenever his father should lay the duty aside.</p>
        <p>The elder Mr. Hendrickson agrees with his son that the unyielding rhythms of a poultry farm are probably a big part of what shaped him. Back during the Great Depression and before, the farm was producing 2,500 white leghorns a week, he said, mainly for sale as breeding stock. Every night, Mr. Hendrickson had to visit all 12 of the large laying houses to make sure the birds had water and heat, and in winter, to check the kerosene heaters that kept their drinking water from freezing. Those nights became his classroom for the natural world.</p>
        <p>''I'd come out at night and hear an owl hoot, I'd hear a fox bark, I'd hear a farmer's dog bark because maybe a rabbit hopped too close to him,'' he said. ''I'd look up and see the stars, and I'd see rings around the moon.''</p>
        <p>Then, in the mid-1920's, the decidedly odd figure of Ernest S. Clowes entered Mr. Hendrickson's deep rural fastness. Mr. Clowes (rhymes with cows) was in his 50's when he moved just down Lumber Lane from the Hendrickson farm. He was a sometime writer who penned nature dispatches for the local Bridgehampton newspaper.</p>
        <p>''He would write about what the possum said when he came out in the spring, and what he said to the raccoon, or what the turtle said,'' Mr. Hendrickson recalled of Mr. Clowes's nature columns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clowes never drove a car, never married, and was so often lost in his reveries that he would walk right by people as though they were not even there. For a kid who was facing a hard and circumscribed life of farming, and who would soon be forced to drop out of high school to help his father, Mr. Clowes's air of education and higher thought was like a breeze from the larger world.</p>
        <p>''He was the best teacher a young fellow like myself could have had,'' Mr. Hendrickson said.</p>
        <p>One day in 1929, Mr. Clowes asked young Richard if he had ever thought of becoming a volunteer weather observer, and so it began. The full weather station arrived the next summer, and together the farmer and the writer drove into town to pick up the equipment and take it back to the farm.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, Mr. Hendrickson was meticulous. April 7, 1931, to site one of Mr. Hendrickson's early dispatches, was a raw and windy day with a high of 44 and a low of 38 at Bridgehampton station. Rain began falling at 8:10 a.m. and ended at precisely 10:55 a.m., the 19-year-old wrote -- not a minute sooner or later. The handwritten sheet for that month, framed under glass, was presented to Mr. Hendrickson by the Weather Service several years ago as a memento -- the oldest of his dispatches that could be found.</p>
        <p>Gradually over the years, taking the weather took on a life of its own. Mr. Hendrickson began keeping a notebook in the pocket of his work shirt, and his observations about wind and sky and the northeasters that periodically raked the land eventually evolved into a book about the weather of eastern Long Island, called ''Winds of the Fish's Tail,'' which he published in 1996 (available from the author: (631) 537-0893). The title refers to a line by Walt Whitman, who described Long Island as a fish with its mouth at New York City and tail at the north and south forks in Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>He also learned to read the weather in ways that went beyond its mere measurement: how every change in wind direction was a signal of an altered pattern, and how to read the speed and turbulence of the jet stream by studying the vapor trails of high-flying aircraft.</p>
        <p>''The dry northwest wind gives us our hottest summer days, and we also get our windiest weather, usually in winter, from the northwest,'' he said, staring up at the sky on a brilliant sunny day that was fairly dry, temperature in the low 80's with a light breeze blowing from the west-northwest. ''We get our heavy rains from the east and northeast.''</p>
        <p>But perhaps the most notable weather day of Mr. Hendrickson's life, Sept. 21, 1938, came with no warning at all. He was working in the chicken houses that afternoon with a professor from Cornell University's agricultural extension program and a veterinarian, testing the chickens so that they could be certified for sale as breeders, when suddenly the building they were in began to shake from wind and rain. The three men bolted for the farmhouse, and by the time they looked back, 26 of the farm's outbuildings, including 2 of the large laying houses, were gone.</p>
        <p>The hurricane of 1938 had arrived. It ripped off the farmhouse roof as the men cowered below, throwing 40-pound asbestos shingles 400 feet and then driving them into the ground like meteors. Of Mr. Hendrickson's 4,500 young hens, 4,000 were killed by being blown against a fence and drowned by the downpour.</p>
        <p>The 1938 hurricane also marked the end of the Great Depression on Long Island's East End, Mr. Hendrickson said. Houses and barns had to be repaired, cars and trucks replaced. The great surge of spending that began in rebuilding from the storm carried on right through World War II and then through the explosion of wealth that continues.</p>
        <p>But the weather remains, and Mr. Hendrickson says it is only a matter of time before people are reminded of it. He shakes his head thinking about the newcomers who in their innocence or arrogance have built homes on Long Island's beachfront dunes.</p>
        <p>''I don't care how much money they've got,'' Mr. Hendrickson said. ''Are we intelligent? Have we learned anything from history?''</p>
