        <p>ACCORDING to the glacial timetable on which big exhibitions at art museums operate these days, it hasn't been especially long, 21 years, since the last major traveling retrospective of the 18th-century French painter Jean-Simeon Chardin.

        <p>ACCORDING to the glacial timetable on which big exhibitions at art museums operate these days, it hasn't been especially long, 21 years, since the last major traveling retrospective of the 18th-century French painter Jean-Simeon Chardin. Of course, if the world were a perfect place, a Chardin show would be on view all the time.</p>
        <p>This one arrives at the Met looking much less cramped and more luxurious than it did at its last stop, in London, on its European tour. The unnecessary excuse is the tercentenary of Chardin's birth in 1699. The show doesn't tell us much that was not already known, but I can't see anything wrong with being reminded occasionally of what great painting is.</p>
        <p>Every great painter is great by some terms or other, Watteau's terms differing from Courbet's, Ingres's from Kandinsky's. Chardin was as great as any artist by the terms he set for himself, which were incredibly circumscribed: for almost his whole career, spanning half a century, nearly every minute of it spent in Paris, Chardin focused on what was not much farther than three or four feet in front of his nose. He painted the same brown crockery, some fruit, eggs and dead rabbits, sometimes mingled with French maids and scrubbed children whose calm and immobility harmonized with the inanimate things around them.</p>
        <p>These people seem arrested in motion, suspended, which can put you in mind of the people in Vermeer's paintings except that Chardin's people look more solid and real than Vermeer's. They are absorbed and inward turning, oblivious of us. When a little girl glances in a mirror while her mother adjusts her bonnet, or when a nurse, balancing a long-handled saucepan against her arm, peels a hard-boiled egg, Chardin somehow makes these brief instants seem to stretch toward infinity, assuming sudden gravity.</p>
        <p>In the process, he conveys both the sensation of glimpsing something unremarkable and the effect of having that glimpse impressed on the mind as a memory. This memory, because it is vivid, mysteriously takes a place in the imagination out of proportion to its significance, like a smell or some notes of music or a breeze that triggers the recollection of a childhood game or a trip or a lost relative. It stays there, waiting.</p>
        <p>No wonder Proust loved Chardin so much. ''You have already experienced it subconsciously,'' he wrote, ''this pleasure one gets from the sight of everyday scenes and inanimate objects, otherwise it would not have risen in your heart when Chardin summoned it in his ringing commanding accents. But your consciousness was too sluggish to reach down to it. It had to wait for Chardin to come and lay hold on it and hoist it to the level of your conscious mind.''</p>
        <p>That's right (Proust is always right), although I'm not sure Chardin rings out with commanding accents, being moderate and soft-spoken, and I would add that beyond just pointing out what is already there, he uncovered a deeper truth in nature, one that reveals itself slowly in his work. It has to do with the interplay of color and rhyming form, which suggests a fundamental order in the world, something immensely reassuring.</p>
        <p>In ''The Smoker's Case,'' for example, it exists in the right-facing L formed by the opened lid of the rosewood case next to the left-facing L formed by the porcelain cup and pot. A third and larger L is made by the thick horizontal slab of the table and the corner of the wall behind it.</p>
        <p>Formal balance then becomes poetry with the abrupt diagonal of the slender pipe, the picture's exclamation point, the point of which is a tiny speck of red in the pipe's bowl, a flame from which tendrils of wispy smoke drift up: movement within stillness. Added to this are the corresponding reflections of silver cup, crystal flask, silver cap and copper goblet, ovals doing a kind of call and response across the picture plane, the image punctuated by delicate blue and rose designs on the pasty white porcelain, fireworks in Chardin's tamped-down context.</p>
        <p>Quietude and deliberation. These were essential ingredients for Chardin, who didn't tell stories or anecdotes. There was no real symbolism in his work, either, no fancy allusions, and above all no sex. A scallion was a scallion was a scallion. This was chaste and humble painting emerging from the most erotic, opulent and rhetorically extravagant era in the history of European painting, exemplified by the perfumed virtuosity of a compatriot and nearly exact contemporary like Boucher. The art of Chardin, by contrast with so much Rococo art, was about love, not sex, a big difference. The sheets stayed pressed in his pictures. If an eroticism existed, we may sense it just as dense pigment: thick, painstakingly built-up paint, which can have a sensual charge.</p>
        <p>Call it understatement. Chardin was the best still life painter ever because he made the most of the least. Sometimes he achieved a huge impact simply with empty space. ''Girl With Shuttlecock'' is a figure silhouetted against a bare wall. Her outline is a triangle complicated by a stray strand of ribbon and the feathers of the shuttlecock, very spare.</p>
        <p>Even more minimalist is ''A Mallard Drake Hanging on a Wall and a Seville Orange.'' The space behind the picture plane is shallow and ambiguous, as it often seems with Chardin. The duck is head down; the body is hung from the upper left of the picture, one wing collapsed at a right angle from the body so that the whole thing forms a kind of calligraphic sign against a plain backdrop. This shape is offset by the orange in the lower right corner: painted haiku. The trajectory that exists from Chardin to Cezanne and Matisse, who both revered him, derives from this perfect mastery of abstract form pared down.</p>
        <p>All writers about Chardin point out that his pictorial family consists of the cups and pans that reappear in one painting after another, decade after decade. We recognize them throughout the 66 works here as friends sharing a comforting universe where nothing ever changes and no one ever dies -- except hares, naturally, whose death in Chardin's hands becomes more a state of grace than morbidity. We're given the signs of rigor mortis and blood stains on the fur. But Chardin's attendance to their condition and by extension our attendance can be so loving and complete that it approaches transference. We can fully believe this is what it's like to be a rabbit, and the association, even though it's a little crazy, elicits empathy.</p>
        <p>Dead rabbits and likewise dead fish: Cartier-Bresson, the photographer, who draws copies of Chardins at the Louvre, has pointed out about the famous dead ray hanging gutted from a hook that it looks as if it were crucified. This dovetails with Proust's equally fantastic metaphor for the ray as ''the nave of a polychrome cathedral.''</p>
        <p>What is it about Chardin, in the end, that makes even his pictures of food cause people to speculate about God? I suspect it has to do with the particular quality of his silence. These are pictures of an extraordinary hushed reverence for the dignity of modest things, for paint's ability to simulate those things, and for a viewer's elevation through extended looking at those things. With Chardin, one loses track of time staring at a bunch of cherries, wondering at their translucence, then counting the cherries -- there are five -- and noticing that five matches the sum of two peaches, a green apple and two sections of a split apricot to create perfect symmetry in the picture.</p>
        <p>A tiny observation, but like many simple facts of life, strangely marvelous when it turns out to be a key to some greater truth. Chardin's work is a compilation of these little facts that together make as true a record of the value of seeing as exists in the history of art.</p>
        <p>''Chardin'' remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 81st Street, (212) 570-7710, through Sept. 3.</p>
