        <p>Health maintenance organizations will cancel insurance coverage for more than 700,000 Medicare beneficiaries next year because the H.M.O.'s are cutting back their participation in  Medicare, an industry trade group announced today.</p>
        <p>Karen M. Ignagni, president of the trade group, the American Association of Health Plans, said the H.M.O.'s were pulling out of numerous counties because they had been ''over-regulated and underpaid'' by the federal government. Medicare payments to H.M.O.'s vary from county to county, depending in part on what Medicare spends for patients in its fee-for-service program.</p>

        <p>Health maintenance organizations will cancel insurance coverage for more than 700,000 Medicare beneficiaries next year because the H.M.O.'s are cutting back their participation in  Medicare, an industry trade group announced today.</p>
        <p>Karen M. Ignagni, president of the trade group, the American Association of Health Plans, said the H.M.O.'s were pulling out of numerous counties because they had been ''over-regulated and underpaid'' by the federal government. Medicare payments to H.M.O.'s vary from county to county, depending in part on what Medicare spends for patients in its fee-for-service program.</p>
        <p>The announcement is being made now because July 3 is the deadline for health plans to tell the government whether they will sign contracts to care for Medicare beneficiaries in 2001. A survey conducted for the association this month found that 18 large H.M.O.'s were planning to pull out of Medicare in areas where they serve 711,055 Medicare recipients. The association disclosed the results of the survey today.</p>
        <p>The new cuts would accelerate a trend. About 734,000 Medicare beneficiaries were dropped by H.M.O.s in the last two years.</p>
        <p>Medicare provides health care for 39 million people who are elderly or disabled. About 6.2 million of them, or 16 percent, are in health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>Many elderly people joined H.M.O.'s to get outpatient drug benefits, but they may lose those benefits when they are forced out of H.M.O.'s. The beneficiaries can return to Medicare's original fee-for-service program, or they can try to find another H.M.O. But there is no guarantee that other health plans will be available or have the capacity to take them.</p>
        <p>Aetna U.S. Healthcare, a unit of Aetna Inc., one of the largest managed care companies, told the Clinton administration today that it was dropping more than half of its 659,000 Medicare beneficiaries in 14 states. The cutbacks will affect a total of 355,000 people, including 36,629 in New York State, 14,780 in Connecticut, 134,324 in Texas, 52,331 in Ohio, 47,670 in Florida, 18,650 in Pennsylvania and 15,283 in California.</p>
        <p>Aetna said it would continue its Medicare H.M.O. operations in New York City, but would leave Nassau, Suffolk, Orange, Putnam and Dutchess Counties in New York.</p>
        <p>The decisions by H.M.O.'s to withdraw from Medicare are relevant to the debate in Congress over how to provide prescription drug benefits to people on Medicare.</p>
        <p>By a vote of 217 to 214, the House on Wednesday passed a bill under which the government would pay subsidies to insurance companies to get them to offer drug benefits to the elderly. Democratic members of Congress repeatedly said that private companies could not be trusted to provide stable, reliable drug benefits, and they cited the volatile Medicare H.M.O. market to support their contention.</p>
        <p>Representative Bob Weygand, Democrat of Rhode Island, said he had just received a letter from United Healthcare, saying it would pull out of the Medicare market in Bristol County, R.I. Mr. Weygand said he feared that insurance companies would, in a similar way, stop offering drug benefits, as proposed under the House Republican plan, if the business became unprofitable.</p>
        <p>Representative Chris John, Democrat of Louisiana, said the last  H.M.O. in his district had just announced that it was pulling out of the Medicare managed care program, known as Medicare+Choice. ''The Republican prescription drug plan would privatize drug coverage in the same manner that Medicare+Choice privatized health care services'' for the elderly, Mr. John said. ''And this plan, too, is doomed to fail.''</p>
        <p>Senate Republicans said today that any legislation adding drug benefits to Medicare should be tied to larger changes in the program, intended to control costs and promote competition.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, said he hoped the panel would approve a Medicare bill next month.</p>
        <p>But Democrats said they doubted that Mr. Roth could muster a consensus. They said that a deal on drug benefits might be arranged this fall through high-level negotiations by President Clinton, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate Republican leader.</p>
        <p>Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House, said the administration was concerned to see H.M.O.'s again dropping large numbers of Medicare beneficiaries. ''It is regrettable,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Foundation Health Systems, based in Los Angeles, said today that it would discontinue its Medicare H.M.O. operations in parts of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Arizona, California and Pennsylvania. The cutbacks will affect 19,000 people, or 7 percent of the 259,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the company's health plans.</p>
        <p>The Cigna Corporation said earlier this month that it would end coverage for 104,000 Medicare beneficiaries in 11 states, including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California and Florida.</p>
        <p>William H. Donaldson, the chairman of Aetna Inc., said, ''The decision to exit certain Medicare markets was reached with great reluctance.'' But, he said, ''inadequate government reimbursements have made operating a number of our Medicare H.M.O.'s no longer viable.''</p>
