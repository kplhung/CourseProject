        <p>The day before Darius Miles made draft history, the 18-year-old basketball prodigy from East St. Louis High School (Ill.) was asked how he decided he was ready for the National Basketball Association.</p>
        <p>''After the high school all-star games, a lot of people just started talking and that's when it got it in my head,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Before the Los Angeles Clippers chose Miles with the third pick in the draft on Wednesday night -- a distinction that made the sinewy 6-foot-9-inch forward the highest high school player ever selected -- Miles was a prodigy at 14, traveling around the country to audition in front of hundreds of scouts at the most prestigious camps.</p>
        <p>This is how kids are indoctrinated to the business of professional sports. We've come a long way since Moses Malone.</p>
        <p>''If a young kid came to me and asked me if I thought he was ready, well, I'd look him in the eye,'' said Malone, the second player in the modern era to jump straight from high school to the pros. ''You can always look at a kid, talk to him, see his inner self and find out if he's ready for the pro game.</p>
        <p>''I still don't know if I was.''</p>
        <p>In 1974, Malone was attending summer school at the University of Maryland. Fresh out of Petersburg High School (Va.), he was taken in the third round of the American Basketball Association draft by the Utah Stars.</p>
        <p>He had been to only two basketball camps, including Dave Bing's. The only footage scouts could rely on was a grainy reel that appeared on ABC's ''Wide World of Sports.'' Malone was not escorted directly to a TNT interview after he was drafted.</p>
        <p>''How did I find out?'' Malone said during a telephone interview this past week. ''John Lucas came by the dorm and told me. I said, 'Ah, man, you joking, right?' He said, 'For real, you been picked by Utah.'</p>
        <p>''We rode around in his car. He was my chauffeur. Back then, I was living off $15 a month. I was playing for orange juice. I had to work.''</p>
        <p>Malone went on to have a Hall of Fame career. He went to a mature team that featured Roger Brown and Ron Boone, veterans who ''gave me a lot of knowledge and kept me in my place.''</p>
        <p>He was asked if he regretted turning pro so young.</p>
        <p>''The only regret I have is that I should have waited 20 more years, so I could get paid the big bucks,'' he said, laughing. He also does not think an N.B.A.-sponsored developmental league will curb the onslaught of teenagers wishing to turn pro.</p>
        <p>Miles and DeShawn Stevenson from Washington Union High in Fresno, Calif., were the 14th and 15th players in the modern era to make the jump.</p>
        <p>''Fine home, big car, they want to live the life,'' Malone said. ''These young athletes watch these pro ballplayers. That's how it is.''</p>
        <p>A record 18 underclassmen were taken in the first round on Wednesday night. Seven first-round picks were traded within minutes or hours after they were drafted. Two of those players, Keyon Dooling and Courtney Alexander, were moved for future first-round picks. Orlando did not even ask for a player in exchange.</p>
        <p>When the Bulls sent Chris Mihm at No. 7 to Cleveland for Jamal Crawford, the No. 8 pick, it was not a draft-day swap along the lines of Chris Webber-for-Anfernee Hardaway in 1993 or Stephon Marbury-for-Ray Allen in 1996. This was the Cavaliers taking a player the Bulls genuinely did not want off their hands.</p>
        <p>It was as if team executives were saying to the class of 2000: ''Thanks for coming in for the workout. You looked great. But we have to fill our buildings and coffers today, not in three years.''</p>
        <p>Nowhere was that more prevalent than in Orlando, which dumped its 10th and 13th picks and the contracts of Corey Maggette and Derek Strong in hopes of clearing more salary-cap room to lure a free-agent prize to the Magic Kingdom.</p>
        <p>John Gabriel, the Orlando general manager, may as well have hung a sign outside his office after the Magic's wild draft-day dealings:</p>
        <p>Tim Duncan or bust.</p>
        <p>After the Bulls and the Magic sacrificed their immediate playoff hopes so they could stockpile money and rebuild in earnest this summer, they find out over the next few weeks if their schemes pay off.</p>
        <p>The Clippers were unafraid to take youthful, impetuous gambles. Forever a mess and consistently at the bottom of the standing, they essentially recast their team.</p>
        <p>Dooling and Miles from the draft. Maggette and Strong from Orlando. Who knows? With this kind of entertaining crew going up and down the Staples Center floor, Lamar Odom just might stay a while.</p>
        <p>The enduring image on Wednesday night was of Miles taking arranged portraits with a group of family and friends that numbered close to 20.</p>
        <p>''Leave basketball out of it for a second,'' said Alexander, one of the few college seniors taken in the first round. ''I think there is a maturation process that we all need to take. Now, Darius Miles may be the exception to the rule. Kevin Garnett was an exception to the rule. Kevin was abnormally mature for his age; he's very, very mature. People need to understand that this is now a business. There's no room for boys on this level.''</p>
        <p>His baggy suit coat framed Miles's shoulders and he looked like the Josh Baskin character in ''Big,'' the movie in which Tom Hanks morphs into a boy again and returns to the innocent life he knew before he sprouted into a man.</p>
        <p>Darius Miles can't go back. He was headed for St. John's a couple of months ago, the most prized recruit of the Mike Jarvis era. But the whispers started. Soon, he was deemed good enough to make the move, from homeroom to the Ritz-Carlton in a single bound, with nary a lecture hall in between.</p>
        <p>''It's a big jump, from a boy to a man,'' he said.</p>
        <p>From Moses to Miles, they keep coming, these kids, with Kobe and KG plastered to their walls. Busts or All-Stars, for better or worse. And the migration won't stop as long as they can play. As Marty Blake, the long-time N.B.A. director of scouting, explained candidly:</p>
        <p>''Everybody don't like school.''</p>
