        <p>Here it is, the biggest party of the year, and they cluster together off to the side: the members of the chess team, the guys from the audiovisual club, future physics majors with thick glasses and pocket protectors. Just what are they doing in this room full of quarterbacks and cheerleaders? Who invited them to the party?</p>
        <p>Every summer, the major Hollywood studios unleash their biggest, loudest and most expensive and star-studded films into a world of vacationing families and entertainment-hungry teenagers. Tom Cruise hangs from impossible cliffs. Mel Gibson skewers sneering Brits. Jim Carrey rides the wild highway. The rules are simple: cars exist to be chased, guns to be fired, affairs to be consummated, rockets to be launched. Special effects blossom like wildflowers on the prairie. Have sequel, will travel.</p>
        <p>But off to the side, clustered together, are a growing number of smaller, less heralded movies -- independent features, foreign films, this year's quirky Shakespeare adaptations -- that somehow find themselves battling it out in the nation's theaters with the big Hollywood quarterbacks. In these movies, cars exist to be driven, guns to be deplored, affairs to be analyzed and rockets? Well, there are no rockets. Have subtitles, will travel.</p>
        <p>''It used to be, five or six years ago, that the indies would stay out of the summer because of the major studio films,'' said Amir Malin, the chairman of Artisan Entertainment. ''But now, with the success that we and others have had in recent years, that's no longer true.''</p>
        <p>The nature of the independent films being released has shifted as well. While still offering standard literary adaptations and films by celebrated foreign directors, many distributors have tried to use the summer as a springboard for darker and quirkier movies aimed at a younger audience.</p>
        <p>''This summer we've got two comedies, both alternative, both hip,'' Mr. Malin said. ''That's what we like to present to summer audiences: counterprogramming to what exists from the major studios.''</p>
        <p>But it is not just films for hipsters that the art houses are offering this summer. They are screening foreign epics, character-driven dramas, absurdist satires. ''The thing to emphasize is that films like ours go up against Hollywood 52 weeks of the year,'' said Mark Urman, a co-president of Lions Gate Films. ''In fact, the summer is for us a great time. It's the time when Hollywood becomes more mindless than ever.''</p>
        <p>During the fall and holiday seasons, the Oscar-hungry Hollywood studios put out their prestige films, and there are more movies in the marketplace competing with specialized films from independent-minded distributors like Lions Gate, Miramax, Sony Pictures Classics, Artisan, Fine Line, Paramount Classics, Fox Searchlight, USA Films and others.</p>
        <p>''In the darker, colder months, films that reach more sophisticated or more mature moviegoers simply stop selling tickets at a certain hour,'' Mr. Urman said. ''Our audiences go home and watch Charlie Rose and retire, or whatever they do. But in the summer, there is such a vacuum of films of ideas, films of emotions, that we have always looked upon summer as an extraordinary opportunity to have a genuine impact.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, some of the biggest hits released by independent distributors in recent years have come out during the summer: ''Il Postino'' in 1994, ''Trainspotting'' in 1996, ''The Full Monty'' in 1997 and, of course, ''The Blair Witch Project'' in 1999.</p>
        <p>''My guiding principle on this is that my mother needs something to see,'' said Mark Gill, the president of Miramax's Los Angeles office. ''It's kind of a joke, but it's true as well. The art audience is driven by educated women, middle-aged and up, who want to see movies that do not have big explosions in them.''</p>
        <p>As recently as four summers ago, Mr. Gill said, 26 films opened in American theaters between mid-May and Labor Day that could be classified as independent or foreign films -- movies given limited releases, usually beginning in New York and Los Angeles and, if they clicked, gradually appearing in an increasing number of cities until no college town was left untouched. For the last two or three years, though, the numbers have shot up to 70 or 75 such films.</p>
        <p>''What happened was that there was an explosion of success at the Academy Awards in 1996, when four of the five films nominated for best picture were from independent distributors,'' Mr. Gill said. ''It was evident there was a marvelous business there, if you could be successful at it.''</p>
        <p>The result, all distributors seem to agree, has been a glut. It is not just your imagination: there are more movie reviews in the paper because there are more and more of these small, limited-release films. While many of the companies that began the independent-film trend in the early 1990's have since given up the ghost, victims of the pitiless economics of a fickle industry, a few have hung on and prospered, and others have merged into larger companies. At the same time, the major Hollywood studios have gotten into the game, either by buying out the independent companies (like Disney's acquisition of Miramax) or starting their own in-house classics division (like Sony Pictures Classics, Fox Searchlight and, most recently, Paramount Classics).</p>
        <p>''The problem is that there has not been substantial growth in the size of the audience,'' Mr. Gill said. ''Even films that are successful must make do with less.''</p>
        <p>So while new companies enter the market, others are putting out fewer films, and there is general agreement that the current pace -- 70 or 75 small films coming out every summer -- won't keep up forever. ''It can't last because so many of them are not succeeding,'' Mr. Gill said.</p>
        <p>What keeps people going is that, first, a small film doesn't have to be a mass-audience hit to turn a profit; it can make do with less. ''We can make $1.5 million on a film, and it doesn't sound like a lot of money, compared to the big studio movies, but in our world, it's a success,'' said David Dinerstein, a co-president of Paramount Classics. And if it somehow does click and, like ''Full Monty'' or ''Blair Witch,'' cross over into a mainstream audience, the profits are amazing.</p>
        <p>''With 'Red Violin,' we had a movie that spoke to a certain audience that is underserved in the summer,'' Mr. Urman said. ''It made $10 million. I know that by certain standards, that can be one Saturday for a Tom Cruise movie. But by independent film standards, that's a breakout; that's a crossover success. And it's not necessary for our kind of films to satisfy everyone. In fact, it is intrinsic in their design that they won't.''</p>
        <p>The other factor in the success of a smaller film is that it is, by definition, not released in the same way as a big summer movie. For something like ''Dinosaur'' or ''The Perfect Storm,'' thousands of prints are put into thousands of theaters all over the country, and millions of dollars are spent on marketing campaigns to insure a huge opening weekend. Smaller films are released more gradually, beginning in the largest markets, then spreading slowly. If the film finds its audience, it can run through the entire summer. A big Hollywood movie, even a substantial success, can substantially burn out in less than a month.</p>
        <p>Marcy Granata, president for publicity and corporate communications at Miramax, said that instead of spending a lot of money to generate excitement over one huge opening, smaller distributors must stage a series of small-scale openings, each week trying to attract the attention of a new crop of local critics and talk show hosts. ''We call it sticking to the knitting,'' Ms. Granata said. ''You treat the opening in Boston as if it were a national opening. The local, grass-roots effort becomes very, very primary.''</p>
        <p>Miramax's ''Hamlet,'' for instance -- the version starring Ethan Hawke and set in modern-day Manhattan -- opened on May 12 in New York and Los Angeles. The next week, it expanded to the top 10 cities. On May 26, it went to the top 20 cities and, on June 9, to the top 40. In recent weeks, it began to expand into the larger college towns, like New Haven. ''You hope for 16 to 20 weeks in theaters,'' Mr. Gill said. ''It used to be you could count on that. But it's so much more competitive now. So few of these movies are successful, it's just ridiculous.''</p>
