        <p>After dominating the United States policy debate over Cuba for nearly two decades, Cuban-American advocates of a hard-line stance toward Havana find themselves on the defensive, increasingly estranged from other Americans, supporters and critics say.</p>
        <p>As a result, the Cuban American National Foundation, the pre-eminent exile lobby, is reorganizing its leadership to include younger faces and today appointed a non-Cuban former State Department expert on Cuba to head its Washington office.</p>
        <p>The Miami-based group is also singling out the districts of Congressional adversaries for television advertisements and pledging to spend ''whatever it takes'' to protect the unyielding American policy it helped to create.</p>
        <p>With the return home this week of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban refugee, and an agreement in Congress to lift the ban on sales of food and medicine to Cuba, exiles are adjusting to a political landscape that increasingly favors accommodation with President Fidel Castro.</p>
        <p>The travails of the foundation, widely viewed as one of the most effective ethnic lobbies in the United States, are emblematic of exiles' lost political ground. The lobby's leaders this week portrayed their prosperous constituency as an underdog, in a moral struggle against Goliath: American farmers and corporations bent on doing business with Castro.</p>
        <p>''We really have no choice but to respond in a very aggressive way,'' said Jose Cardenas, the foundation's Washington director.</p>
        <p>Joe Garcia, the foundation's new executive director, complained that the Cuban lobby had been bruised by ''very good players'' in the public relations arena: Attorney General Janet Reno, President Clinton and Mr. Castro himself.</p>
        <p>For some Cuba-watchers, such shifts are a stark reversal from the  foundation's heyday under the iron-fisted stewardship of Jorge Mas Canosa, a multimillionaire businessman who breezed through the halls of Washington with the aura and the entourage of a head of state.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Mas Canosa, the well-financed lobby mustered a stable of loyal Congressional allies, drafted Cuba legislation, established anti-Castro radio and television stations with federal money and kept United States-Cuban relations in a deep freeze.</p>
        <p>But since Mr. Mas Canosa's death in 1997, the exiles have yet to put forth a national figure who commands respect and fear in Washington. Without such leadership, the foundation has invited challengers.</p>
        <p>''That's all it was: It was Jorge Mas, his personal relationships and fund-raising,'' said a Congressional aide who works with the lobby. ''That got things done. Now that he's died, his son really hasn't taken up the cause.''</p>
        <p>Under the direction of Mr. Mas Canosa's son, who is also named Jorge, the foundation ran into a public relations fiasco with the Elian Gonzalez case. To an extent, it was self-inflicted. Within hours of the boy's rescue from Florida waters last Thanksgiving, the lobby was the first to convert Elian, literally, into a poster child, distributing thousands of leaflets of him at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle beneath the headline: ''Another child victim of Fidel Castro.''</p>
        <p>Castro quickly responded, portraying Elian as a kidnap victim, being kept from a devoted father by an exile band of extremists. Americans who had paid little attention to the Cuba policy debate tended to support the father's claim over exile relatives in Miami, who insisted that the boy be granted political asylum.</p>
        <p>''They showed what they were really all about,'' Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, said of the Cuban-American hard-liners. ''They were ready to sacrifice one of their own kids, and they didn't really care about separating him from his father.''</p>
        <p>Exile hard-liners acknowledge missteps in handling the case. But they deny their actions had any impact in what came next: a drive by American business -- led by the Farm Bureau and the United States Chamber of Commerce -- to open Cuba for business after 38 years of embargo.</p>
        <p>''I think that if there was any negativity surrounding the Elian Gonzalez situation, it was pretty much self-contained,'' Mr. Cardenas said. ''I think that basically people saw it as the equivalent of the O. J. situation. They just wanted it to be over, and out of their living rooms.''</p>
        <p>But Max Castro, a sociologist at the University of Miami's North-South Center, disagrees.</p>
        <p>During the seven-month struggle over Elian, Mr. Castro said, people who had paid little attention to America's policy toward Cuba began to ask questions about the hard-line approach. ''Americans have basically said it's a policy that hasn't worked, and it's inconsistent with the rest of our foreign policy,'' Mr. Castro said.</p>
        <p>Pressed by lawmakers representing wheat and rice growers, Congressional Republicans agreed this week to lift the ban on sales of food to Cuba, a move that has already been approved by the Senate.</p>
        <p>Foundation officials portrayed the deal as merely symbolic, noting that allies had barred federal or private credits for such sales.</p>
        <p>The lobby moved quickly to regain its footing. In a news conference today, the foundation announced that Dennis Hays, a former American ambassador in Suriname, would take over its Washington office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hays, who is not Cuban-American, endeared himself to many exiles in 1995, when he resigned as the State Department's top officer for Cuba to protest a deal to allow the forced repatriation of Cuban refugees.</p>
        <p>The foundation has also sought to renovate its image in Miami, where it has long been led by exiles from Mr. Mas Canosa's generation.</p>
        <p>In his new post, the American-born Mr. Garcia, 35, promises to update the foundation's image, including ''more sophisticated'' media efforts to educate the American people about Cuba.</p>
        <p>''You certainly are going to see a reinvigorated foundation,'' said Mr. Garcia. He eschews the familiar ''bearded tyrant'' references to President Castro, calling him instead ''this old goofball.''</p>
        <p>As a start, the foundation plans to run television advertisements that highlight Mr. Castro's abuses. Beginning this weekend, the foundation plans to air advertisements denouncing the haven provided by Cuba to scores of fugitives from American justice.</p>
        <p>The advertisements are to broadcast first in Washington, D.C., Mr. Cardenas said, and later in the districts of selected lawmakers who favor easing sanctions.</p>
        <p>Mr. McDermott, the Washington Democrat, said foundation officials risked further isolating themselves with such tactics. ''Threatening people is not going to help them,'' he said.</p>
