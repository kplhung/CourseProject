        <p>Correction of June 28 article on problems at New York City Ballet orchestra, concerning dates of creation and first performance of George Balanchine ballet Concerto Barocco</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on Wednesday about problems at the New York City Ballet orchestra misstated the year that George Balanchine created his ballet ''Concerto Barocco.'' It was 1941, not 1948; it was first performed by the City Ballet in 1948.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated how long Gordon Boelzner has been music director. He has held this position only since 1990, although he has been on the ballet's musical staff for 41 years.</p>
