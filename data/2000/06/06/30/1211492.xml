        <p>While much of the world seems clamorous, messy and despoiled, the view in Koichiro Kurita's photographs is quiet and still, its slight irregularities adding subtle drama to an otherwise pristine landscape.</p>
        <p>Nature's simple wonders have been central to Mr. Kurita's art for more than a decade. Here, his platinum prints, made on handmade Japanese rice paper, have the kind of breathtaking tonal range that Paul Strand had deemed impossible. To use photography honestly, Strand noted in 1917, one must have ''a real respect for the thing in front of him,'' a respect translated ''through a range of almost infinite tonal values which lie beyond the skill of human hand.''</p>

        <p>Nature's simple wonders have been central to Mr. Kurita's art for more than a decade. Here, his platinum prints, made on handmade Japanese rice paper, have the kind of breathtaking tonal range that Paul Strand had deemed impossible. To use photography honestly, Strand noted in 1917, one must have ''a real respect for the thing in front of him,'' a respect translated ''through a range of almost infinite tonal values which lie beyond the skill of human hand.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kurita, who was born in Manchuria and has been living in New York City since 1990, follows in the tradition of Strand and Edward Weston. Although the images here were mostly taken in this country, the aesthetic is Japanese. Wherever he goes, Mr. Kurita finds understated lyricism.</p>
        <p>As if to oblige him, nature arranges itself in lovely, minimalist forms: a delicately sculptural ball of twigs in ''Dried Grass (Chesapeake, Va., 1991),'' gleaming circles of ice around bare stems meeting dark, mirror-smooth water in ''Crystal (Boundary Water, Minn., 1998),'' stones in shades of white and gray positioned just so in a lake (Lake Superior, Minn., 1999).</p>
        <p>Four of Mr. Kurita's still lifes are included. In these, he has photographed various plants against a framed backdrop of his charcoal drawings. But given the company they are keeping, they seem slight and contrived -- no match, certainly, for a silver gelatin print a few feet away.</p>
        <p>The print, ''Reflection on a Pond (Nagano, Japan, 1985),'' shows the barest hint of forms and small circles on the surface of pale, pale water. But if you look closely, right in the middle of the photograph is an insect (you can almost count its legs) that seems to have alighted on polished glass.</p>
