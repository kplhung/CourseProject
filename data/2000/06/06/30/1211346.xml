        <p>YUEH-Norma N., M.D. died Wednesday morning at home. She was 72. Born in China, she emigrated to the U.S. on a full scholarship to St. Joseph's College, West Hartford, CT. She later attended Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA and received her doctorate in Library Sciences from Columbia University, New York, NY. During her career, Dr. Yueh worked for the United Nations, The New York Public Library, William Paterson University in Wayne, NJ and at Ramapo College of NJ, where she held the positions of Director of Library Services and most recently, Director of Research. During her tenure at Ramapo College, she received several Managerial Merit Awards from the college and the library was commended by the Middle States Association accreditation team. Dr. Yueh held four presidencies: Council of National Library and Information Association, the Chinese American Librarians Association, New Jersey Library Association and Council of New Jersey College and University Librarians. She served on various executive boards and chaired numerous national, regional and state committees in the college library and higher education fields. Ramapo College recently named a conference room after Dr. Yueh and was to award her ''Emeritus'' status, effective upon her scheduled retirement on June 30, 2000. She was the first woman in the college's history to receive this status. Survivors incude two daughters, Brenda Yueh of Mountain Lakes, NJ and Dara Yueh of Wayne, NJ, a sister, Colleen Shen of St. Louis, MO; a brother, Robert Yu of Beijing, China; and a mother and step-father, Mr. and Mrs. F. Lin of Beijing, China. Viewing will be on Friday, June 30 from 2-4 and 7-9 at Norman Dean Funeral Home, 16 Righter Avenue, Denville, NJ. Funeral services will be on July 1 at 9:30am at St. Catherine's of Siena Church, N. Pocono Road, Mountain Lakes, NJ.
