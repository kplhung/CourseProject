        <p>The Clinton administration introduced a sweeping new proposal today at the World Trade Organization to change the way governments subsidize farmers, challenging the European Union's extensive agricultural subsidies.</p>
        <p>The American plan would simplify financial support to farmers and reduce or end disparities in tariffs to increase market openings for agricultural goods from other countries.</p>
        <p>The proposal, disclosed today in Geneva and Washington, will be formally introduced Friday at a session of the W.T.O. agricultural talks, which began last March.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, the current domestic subsidies system would be revised to eliminate those agricultural subsidies not directly linked to price and volume of output. There also would be a ceiling on the level of domestic subsidies based on a percentage of the country's total agricultural production.</p>
        <p>While the approach by the United States was welcomed by exporting countries, it is likely to add to tension between the United States and the European Union, which are already at odds over a number of politically sensitive trade matters, including bananas and corporate tax breaks.</p>
        <p>The failure to begin a new global trade round last December in Seattle was in large part attributed to serious differences in how to tackle the issue of agriculture. The United States and an 18-country group of agriculture exporters argue that European export subsidies hinder competition and drive up consumer prices. The E.U., Switzerland, Norway and Japan maintain that rural areas need such financial protection to ensure their survival.</p>
        <p>Despite these differences, members of the W.T.O. are bound to negotiate farm subsidies because of commitments they have already made.</p>
        <p>The new United States proposal is directly contrary to the position of the European Union, which spends about half of its total budget on agricultural subsidies and supports payments to farmers not to grow crops.</p>
        <p>The 15-country trading bloc has criticized the United States government for denouncing subsidies at the same time it supports what the Europeans call a hidden subsidy, emergency aid, to farmers.</p>
        <p>Last week Franz Fischler, the union's agricultural commissioner, criticized American farm spending, saying the Clinton administration had increased spending to record levels. Two weeks ago Congress passed a $15 billion relief bill to assist farmers who are facing a fourth year of economic downturn.</p>
        <p>The American special negotiator for agriculture, Gregory Frazier, in Geneva, defended emergency aid packages to American farmers as falling within W.T.O. rules.</p>
