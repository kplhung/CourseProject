        <p>Ugandans voted today in an unusual referendum on how they want to be governed, a question tied deeply to the violence of the country's past and the popularity of President Yoweri Museveni, who has, in large measure, ended that violence.</p>
        <p>Turnout among Uganda's 9.6 million voters appeared relatively light, which Mr. Museveni's opponents said showed the success of their call for a boycott. But apart from trying to avoid the rain in many parts of Uganda, voters may have stayed home also because the election's result, in Mr. Museveni's favor, never seemed in doubt.</p>
        <p>''I like Museveni very much,'' Sugra Khan, 69, said after casting her vote in a drizzle at a near-empty soccer field in this southwestern town early this morning. ''Now we have no problems. I am sleeping well.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Khan said she had cast her vote from her life: in the 1970's, the dictator Idi Amin -- responsible for as many as 500,000 deaths -- expelled some 70,000 Ugandans of Asian descent, among them her own family.</p>
        <p>The choice in the referendum was whether to return to a multiparty system or to continue the so-called Movement system favored by Mr. Museveni, who has been president since he won a five-year guerrilla war in 1986.</p>
        <p>Under the Movement, political parties are permitted in name only. Mr. Museveni's argument is that political parties have divided Ugandans by ethnicity and religion, allowing men like Mr. Amin and Milton Obote, whom Mr. Museveni overthrew, to take power.</p>
        <p>The question echoes the debate about whether African nations -- lacking a middle class that votes its economic interests rather than its ethnic or religious ties -- are politically mature enough for the kind of democracy practiced by rich nations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Museveni's opponents, who support a multiparty system, depict the Movement as a one-party state that he manipulates to stay in power. The Movement bans party conventions and rallies.</p>
        <p>''It's a kind of dictatorship,'' said Nasser Sebaggala, the former mayor of the capital, Kampala, who plans to run for president next year against Mr. Museveni. ''People want a change.''</p>
        <p>Early on, opponents of Mr. Museveni called for a boycott of the election. They have mounted a legal challenge against the parliamentary vote that established the referendum and say that, at any rate, the process is stacked against them.</p>
        <p>In an interview today, Mr. Sebaggala said people had boycotted the vote in huge numbers, though it was impossible to tell because the results will not be known until Saturday at the earliest. By law, results must be released within 48 hours.</p>
        <p>Officials on all sides say the results will be significant nonetheless, as an early indication for the more important elections next year for both Parliament and the presidency.</p>
        <p>In the last presidential elections, in 1996, Mr. Museveni won three-quarters of the vote, with about three-quarters of the electorate turning out. A similar result now would give him a boost into next year's elections, while his opponents are certain to capitalize on any weakening in his past high levels of support.</p>
        <p>Movement officials have been bracing for a low turnout, saying Ugandans have voted often enough that they have begun to take that right for granted. That explanation was echoed today by the assistant town clerk in Mbabara, who was also a local election supervisor.</p>
        <p>''The people who are educated are starting to talk about why should they be bothered,'' he said. ''There is fatigue. I don't see people getting excited.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Museveni has campaigned on his record -- what he says are huge strides in economic growth, education and infrastructure, as well as much more peace and stability than in the past. His opponents say Ugandans are still poor, that 700,000 people are displaced by two rebellions and that most Ugandans oppose Mr. Museveni's involvement in the rebellion in neighboring Congo.</p>
        <p>But some voters are separating the candidates from the issues, and in particular Mr. Museveni from the Movement. Allen Kyomugasho, a 65-year-old shopkeeper in Mbabara, said she likes Mr. Museveni but voted today to bring back political parties.</p>
        <p>''I don't blame Museveni,'' Mrs. Kyomugasho said. ''I just want a change.''</p>
