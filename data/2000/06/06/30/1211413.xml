        <p>Randy Choate and Craig Dingman got the calls in Louisville, Ky., at 10:30 this morning. Be in the lobby in 10 minutes, the Class AAA pitchers were told; they had less than an hour to catch the plane to join the Yankees in Detroit.

        <p>Randy Choate and Craig Dingman got the calls in Louisville, Ky., at 10:30 this morning. Be in the lobby in 10 minutes, the Class AAA pitchers were told; they had less than an hour to catch the plane to join the Yankees in Detroit. Later, the pitchers stood slack-jawed as they emerged from the visiting dugout to look at Comerica Park for the first time. They looked stunned when David Cone and Derek Jeter approached to say hello.</p>
        <p>''My jaw hit the floor,'' Dingman said of being called up from Columbus. ''It's all your dreams coming true.''</p>
        <p>But this particular fairy tale comes at a less than storybook time for the Yankees. Choate, 24, and Dingman, 26, who have never been in the major leagues, are only the latest in the parade of pitchers moving up and down in the organization as injuries take their toll on the Yankees' major league staff.</p>
        <p>Their assignment from Manager Joe Torre is telling. ''I said, 'Bring a little fun into this clubhouse,' '' Torre said. ''For sure, they'll bring us some fresh arms, and we haven't had that for a while.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees desperately need reinforcement in both areas. While trade talks for a slugger enveloped the organization for weeks -- and should now subside with the acquisition of David Justice -- it is actually the virtual collapse of the pitching staff that has caused most of the Yankees' recent woes. And with Justice on board, the Yankees will most likely move to trade for a pitcher.</p>
        <p>In the 41 games after May 11, when the Yankees were 22-9 with a staff earned run average of 3.95, the Yankees compiled a 5.24 E.R.A. while winning 15 and losing 26.</p>
        <p>Today, one day after placing Ramiro Mendoza, their most reliable starter so far this season, on the 15-day disabled list with weakness in the posterior of his right shoulder, an already fragile staff seemed close to breaking.</p>
        <p>Allen Watson, who relieved the rookie Ben Ford in the third inning of Wednesday's loss only to yield three home runs in the space of 11 hitters, was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a dislocated right shoulder. Watson, a left-hander, popped out his shoulder while reaching for a comebacker to the mound.</p>
        <p>The Yankees hope their fortunes will begin to turn ever so slightly this weekend at Tampa Bay. They expect to start Jason Grimsley on Friday, in the spot that Andy Pettitte would have filled had he not pitched on three days' rest tonight. And then Orlando Hernandez, with his sore elbow, will pitch on Saturday. And Roger Clemens, who had inhabited the disabled list himself with a sore groin, will start on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The new arrivals -- Dingman and Choate -- will be in the bullpen. Both were relievers at Columbus. Dingman had a 4-1 record and 3.00 E.R.A., and Choate was 2-0 with a 2.10 E.R.A.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Cone, who has been healthy but ineffective, is clinging to the side of the Yankees' rocking ship, hoping stability comes soon.</p>
        <p>''We need to get some consistency in the rotation,'' he said. ''We're makeshift. It has a residual effect in the organization when you call pitchers up who are not ready for it. We need to get the rotation back in order and healthy.''</p>
