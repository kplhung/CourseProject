        <p>In Stanley Walden's one-act opera, Franz Kafka's famous ''Letter to My Father'' is furnished with an addressee who not only can be seen but also sings. The original document -- long, tortured, accusatory and confessional -- was never delivered, nor perhaps was it ever intended to be. If its solitary and private nature is in fact genuine, the premise on which ''Kafka: Letter to My Father'' is made to stand becomes shaky indeed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walden's workmanlike stage piece, given a credible and professional production at the Kaye Playhouse on Wednesday night, assumes that having heard of Kafka senior from his son's lips, the audience will want to meet the gentleman in person. This may not be the case at all. The shadow, properly evoked, becomes more palpable than whatever may have cast it, and two examples -- one sublime, the other less so -- come to mind.</p>

        <p>In Stanley Walden's one-act opera, Franz Kafka's famous ''Letter to My Father'' is furnished with an addressee who not only can be seen but also sings. The original document -- long, tortured, accusatory and confessional -- was never delivered, nor perhaps was it ever intended to be. If its solitary and private nature is in fact genuine, the premise on which ''Kafka: Letter to My Father'' is made to stand becomes shaky indeed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walden's workmanlike stage piece, given a credible and professional production at the Kaye Playhouse on Wednesday night, assumes that having heard of Kafka senior from his son's lips, the audience will want to meet the gentleman in person. This may not be the case at all. The shadow, properly evoked, becomes more palpable than whatever may have cast it, and two examples -- one sublime, the other less so -- come to mind.</p>
        <p>Think first of Bach's music for solo violin and solo cello: triumphs of omission made powerful by the harmony and counterpoint they imply but rarely stated outright. Think also of modern horror movies, which achieve their ghastliness through makeup and technology but remain significantly less frightening than the unseen or barely glimpsed terrors of ''The Black Cat'' and ''The Turn of the Screw.''</p>
        <p>By creating a father who is flesh and blood and filled with song, Mr. Walden also robs us of Kafka's ambiguous clouding of subject and object. For in the end, how much affection and resentment is directed outward and how much toward the writer himself? In other words, to what degree is Kafka's father Kafka himself? And how much of this index of callousness and cruelty is tortured self-examination, and how much indictment of another?</p>
        <p>David Shapero, an excellent bass, has the difficult task of making us believe in this particular Hermann Kafka. Goaded perhaps by his stage director, Charles Maryan, Mr. Shapero is animated to a fault. I, for one, picture a stern and taciturn Central European paterfamilias not given to some of the undignified dinner table antics witnessed on Wednesday night. But then, the beauty and the strength of an unseen father is his capacity to produce customized images to match our own separate parent-ridden imaginations.</p>
        <p>Atkin Pace's set is a pair of twisting wooden staircases and does its job efficiently. Mr. Walden, an American working in Germany, has made his own English translation of ''Kafka: A Letter to My Father,'' which has had several German productions since 1996. He gives Franz a few brief phrases to sing, but otherwise this is a spoken part, handled convincingly by Dana Watkins. The scenes of bourgeois Jewish domestic life are filled out by Kafka's three sisters, played by Tara Venditti, Tracy Bidleman and Mary Ann Stewart, who briefly double as prostitutes. Hope Clarke as the mother dances discreetly, although interjecting choreography may not have been a good idea. The boyhood Franz is well done by Bartholt Clagett.</p>
        <p>Richard Marshall conducted a very competent ensemble of 17 in music that is not easy to play. Mr. Walden follows the well-traveled school of opera composing that cheerfully abandons music to the service of theater. The writing is through-composed, not symmetrically arranged, following the text step by step and responding to it moment by moment. In much the same way, the vocal lines, favoring big leaps and a calculated gracelessness, subscribe to the policy that music is put in opera not to be beautiful but theatrically responsible.</p>
        <p>Using a language that hovers between the atonal and the barely tonal, Mr. Walden's opera does its work well. The orchestration can be colorful and delicate; the piece also moves in a thoroughly professional way. I am not taken with its music, but my true problem is with the original idea, which may be guilty of the same mistake made by a number of 19th-century composers, distinguished men so horrified by Bach's ''incomplete'' solo violin sonatas that they took it upon themselves to add the piano parts the composer had surely meant to include.</p>
