        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free.  * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* ANNI ALBERS, Jewish Museum, Fifth Avenue at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Aug. 20). This survey of arguably the most influential textile artist of the 20th century is part retrospective, part weaving seminar, part biography -- and altogether fascinating. It traces the development of Albers's work from her student days at the Bauhaus to Black Mountain College, where she taught with her husband, Josef. It contrasts her designs for commercial fabrics, which emphasized structure and materials in new ways, with her pictorially striking handloomed pieces. A gallery of photographs, letters, personal memorabilia and pre-Columbian textile fragments she collected reflects her character and quietly glamorous personal style. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Tuesdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50, students and senior citizens; free for children under 12 (Roberta Smith).</p>

        <p>* ANNI ALBERS, Jewish Museum, Fifth Avenue at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Aug. 20).

        <p>* ''THE ART OF WILLIAM EDMONDSON,'' Museum of American Folk Art, 2 Lincoln Square, (212) 595-9533 (through Aug. 27). All creatures, celestial, human and animal, find their way into the limestone sculpture of Edmondson (1874-1951) and the results feel like an epic folk opera: score by Scott Joplin, libretto by Aesop, choreography by the great master dancers of Yorubaland. This exhibition also includes photographs of the artist by Edward Weston, Consuelo Kanaga and Louise Dahl-Wolfe, showing him at home in Nashville, where, at 59, he began to carve gravestones and garden ornaments for the local African-American community. In 1937 he made a solo debut at the Museum of Modern Art, and he has been part of the American pantheon ever since. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''ART AND ORACLE: SPIRIT VOICES OF AFRICA,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through July 30). This is the first big international loan exhibition of African art to appear at the Met outside the Michael C. Rockefeller wing, and it is gorgeous. The subject is divination, the practice of channeling superhuman knowledge to predict the future, diagnose illness and promote social harmony. Nearly every object here has a role in that process or reflects its effects, from a ''power figure'' that looks as explosive as a stick of dynamite to a Yoruba divination tray believed to be the oldest African wood sculpture in the West, to the portrait of a king who was warned by diviners to beware of water and had himself depicted as half-fish. (He ended up in exile far across the Atlantic in Martinique.) Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''THE CHANGING FACE OF LIBERTY: FEMALE ALLEGORIES OF AMERICA,'' New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through Sept. 3). Uncle Sam, the allegorical male representative of the United States, has always had a female counterpart, the damsel dressed in flowing robes who came to symbolize Liberty. As a sequel to its ''Uncle Sam'' show, the historical society mounted this very lively display of his iconic sister in her many guises, from ''L'Amerique,'' an Indian princess with feathers in her hair who represented the New World in post-Columbus maps, to the matronly Lady Liberty portrayed in the Bartholdi statue that stands in New York Harbor. The fascinating story of Liberty's evolution is told in posters, cartoons, illustrations and photographs. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students over 12 and the elderly (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>* WILLIAM MERRITT CHASE, ''Modern American Landscapes, 1886-1890,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Aug. 13). Chase (1849-1916) had a long, distinguished run as a painter, teacher and art politician. But this show zeroes in on the five-year period when, in a transitional phase between the brown, murky tones of his Munich training and his arrival at a lighter style based on French Impressionism, he painted genteel views of park landscapes in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Aside from their engaging scenic content, the 35 oils and pastels in the show are important because they are the first paintings in which an Impressionist style was used to depict American subjects. Recent examination corrected some errors about their locales. And new scholarly speculation on Chase's motives for painting them suggest that he wanted them to serve as examples of ''civilized urban landscapes'' that accorded with the European avant-garde model of modern life. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>VIVIAN CHERRY, ''A Working Street Photographer, 1940's-90's,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Aug. 6). A fast eye, a quick mind and a speedy shutter are essentials for a good street photographer, a breed of picture-taker with which Ms. Cherry proudly identifies. Over the last half-century she has taken her lens from Depression-era Harlem to Mexico and the rural South, and this show of more than 70 works, organized from the museum's own collection, has some real strengths. Among them is a troubling 1948 series on small boys in New York City playing at adult violence, menacing each other with authentic-looking toy guns and staging ''lynchings.'' Most of the photographs are in vintage black and white, with more edge to them than her recent color photographs of Mexico and Times Square. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''STUART DAVIS IN GLOUCESTER,'' National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 90th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through July 30). The quaint fishing port of Gloucester, Mass., seemed an unlikely hangout for the jazzy city painter Davis (1894-1964). But he actually loved the place, and in the summers he spent there, from 1915 to 1934, he used motifs drawn from the rocky coast, the townscape and the maritime activity as he worked toward a more progressive style of painting. This show, with some 45 oils, watercolors and drawings, gives a good account of his struggles in assimilating Modernist ideas to arrive at the innovative American Cubist style for which he is celebrated. But in the end, Davis's art had more to do with his own genius: his gift for paring line and shape to essences and uniting them with scintillating color. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $4.50, children 6 to 16, students and the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''FOR THE NEW CENTURY: JAPANESE TREASURES FROM THE ASIAN ART MUSEUM OF SAN FRANCISCO,'' Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155 (through July 9). For a total immersion in sheer beauty, this gathering of some 50 classic objects is hard to beat. They include an exceptionally personable Haniwa warrior, wearing balloonlike trousers and a hi-there smile, a big painting of Buddhist heaven and a famed 15th-century Shigaraki-ware jar that seems to hold an abstract landscape in a drift of snowy glaze. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.. Admission: $5; $3 for students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''EDWARD HOPPER, PRINTMAKER,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through July 16). Before concentrating on paintings, Hopper (1882-1967) made prints from 1913 to 1923. In that decade he produced his first mature work, a wonderful body of etchings that brought realism, emotion and a strong sense of the medium's potential to a field that had become more decorative than challenging. Using many of the motifs he was to pursue in his later paintings -- nudes, loners, decrepit houses, night scenes, railroad trains -- Hopper took full advantage of the intense moodiness a black-and-white etching can convey. The pervasive theme of loneliness and isolation for which he was noted is very much present in this show. The nearly 50 works here are a fine introduction to Hopper's basic themes, and give a splendid idea of what he accomplished in the demanding medium. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50, students and the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''MAKING CHOICES, 1920-1960,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Sept. 26). The main event at the Modern these days is the museum itself. This has been the case since last fall, when the project ''MOMA 2000'' began the first of what will be three successive top-to-bottom reinstallations of the permanent collection galleries. The affair has been billed as a test drive for the future, a chance for an institution to rethink the modern art tradition that it helped invent and to consider its own identity in what is often called a postmodern world. This second installment, which looks denser, weirder, messier and more truly modern (or maybe postmodern) than the first, is a big leap in the right direction. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''OTHER PICTURES: VERNACULAR PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE THOMAS WALTHER COLLECTION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Aug. 27). A deceptively modest and sublimely endearing exhibition of several dozen photographs by anonymous amateurs, shot between the 1910's and 1960's, the heyday of the black-and-white snapshot, Surrealism and New Vision photography. They are a catalog of aspiring masterpieces in a modernist mode and serendipitous catastrophes. In the extraordinary way such things happen, these pictures traveled from drugstore to family album to attic to Dumpster to flea market into the hands of some scavenging dealer-collector, whereupon they became items on the art market, until finally wending their way to their present location. Isn't life amazing sometimes? And don't miss ''The Snapshot'' (through July 21), a companion show at the excellent Ubu Gallery, nearby at 16 East 78th Street, which includes several dozen more amateurs' gems, equally lovable. Hours and admission: See above (Michael Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''PAINTERS IN PARIS: 1895-1950,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Dec. 31). This show of more than 100 paintings celebrates the Met's acquisitions of works by School of Paris painters, going back to 1946 when Gertrude Stein bequeathed her portrait, done by Picasso in 1906. The portrait served as a cornerstone for later acquisitions in the field, particularly over the last 20 years. The museum's increasing interest and diligent wooing of collectors have brought not only single works but also groups and entire holdings, like the 18 major objects bequeathed by Florene  M. Schoenborn in 1995 and the Jacques and Natasha Gelman trove of 85 masterpieces accessioned in 1998. The treasures on view include works by some of the 20th century's greatest: Bonnard, Braque, Chagall, de Chirico, Derain, Gris, Leger, Matisse, Miro, Modigliani and Picasso, in an animated arrangement that should beguile the most jaded Met-goer. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''1900: ART AT THE CROSSROADS,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 10). A wacky exercise in historical simulation, the excuse being a new century. It is hard to remember the last time so many bad pictures were in one place at one time, unless you consider eBay a place. There is also a good deal of excellent art mixed in among the dogs, and sometimes what is best is not what you would expect, which is partly the show's point. We're meant to look anew at a moment 100 years ago when it was not yet clear who would be the pioneers in the 20th century and who would be forgotten. Thus recapturing innocence, we can make connections that for the sake of simplification or because of ignorance art historians have glossed over. The show provides just enough compensatory rewards for its schlock quotient and whatever might be unclear about its inclusionary standards. But patience is required. The weak-hearted and modern-day cultural Pharisees may never get past the shock of confronting so much of the art that the abstractionists were rebelling against in a museum created as a shrine to 20th-century abstraction. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays ad Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $7, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''RESERVATION X: THE POWER OF PLACE,'' National Museum of the America Indian, Smithsonian Institution, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, (212) 668-6624 (through Aug. 20). This show of installations by seven artists from Canada and the United States is a lean, clean, impeccably presented take on the tangled subject of what it means to be Native American today. The reservation, as a place and as a state of mind, is the central metaphor. All of the artists were born or have lived on one, and tend to view these set-aside territories as preserves rather than prisons, places where endangered cultures can, potentially at least, remain both intact and be open to change. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Free (Cotter)</p>
        <p>''THE WORLD OF SCHOLARS' ROCKS: GARDENS, STUDIOS AND PAINTINGS,''  Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 81st Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Aug. 20). The odd-shaped tabletop objects from China known as scholars' rocks, shaped by nature and human intervention, rate scant mention in art history books. But they enjoyed a vogue in New York as the Pet Rocks of the 1990's. This exhibition wisely places them in the larger context of Chinese culture by setting a choice selection of rocks among historical paintings whose subjects they both echoed and inspired. The paintings, drawn from the museum's constantly rotating collection, are wonderful; the rocks look good, too, and the Met's Ming-style Astor Court, with its own giant moonscape stones, fits right into the prevailing theme. Hours and admissions: See above (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>FREDERIC EDWIN CHURCH, ''In Search of the Promised Land,'' Berry-Hill, 11 East 70th Street, (212) 744-2300 (through July 15). This sumptuous exhibition of 50 works, the largest in New York in nearly 30 years, spans most of Church's long career, offering opportunities to contrast his innate early talent with its maturation, his reverence for the American landscape with his depiction of exotic sites, and his grand, sometimes grandiose finished statements with his small animated studies (Smith).</p>
        <p>''THE COLLECTOR AS PATRON IN THE 20TH CENTURY,'' Knoedler &amp; Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550 (through July 31). This two-tiered exhibition honors American collectors present and past. Upstairs an exemplary selection from five private collections summarizes postwar American art. Downstairs a fascinating archival display of correspondence, photographs and color reproductions profiles 28 important American collections, tracing their impact on American museums and offering tantalizing glimpses of their dealings with Knoedler, the oldest living art gallery in New York (Smith).</p>
        <p>ANDRE RAFFRAY, ''Hommage a l'Art,'' Achim Moeller, 167 East 73rd Street, (212) 988-4500 (through July 7). This French conceptualist makes meticulous, faintly amusing art about art. Using pencil, colored pencils or oil paint, he copies images by Seurat, Mondrian and other modern masters, producing lifeless simulations of photographic reproductions. And he makes photorealist pictures of actual scenes depicted in earlier works. Mr. Raffray does not generate much visual excitement, but he raises interesting questions about seeing and the construction of reality (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>JOAQUIN TORRES-GARCIA, CDS, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555 (through July 29). The pioneering, peripatetic Uruguayan Modernist is here represented in a modest exhibition of small works on paper and several easel-size oil paintings. The show includes early, brusquely painted city and harbor scenes but is devoted mainly to the artist's distinctive combination of grid-based abstraction and cosmic, pictographic symbolism (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>ROBERT ARNESON, ''Me, Myself and I,'' Franklin Parrasch Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 248-5360 (through July 21). One of the zaniest of gifted self-portrayers, the ceramist Robert Arneson (1930-1992) models his own head in a multiplicity of guises. A dozen versions appear in this first commercial gallery survey of Arneson likenesses. The concentration is on work done in the 70's and 80's, from a very pink and benign Santa Claus to a scary, scowling mask in black and white that suggests a searcher scratching at his own dark soul. One of the funniest is the 1975 ''Trophy (For Soap Box Derby),'' depicting a goggled and helmeted hunkered-down head with a mean out-to-win expression, mouth clamped around Arneson's habitual cigar. This show barely hints at the many personas Arneson conjured up, but it does give the sense of a maverick talent in total command of his medium, who in his cartoony explorations hit not only on himself but everyman (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''EXTRA ORDINARY,'' James Cohan, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 755-7171 (through July 7). This excellent group exhibition presents a variety of ways of defamiliarizing the familiar. Outstanding works include a near-hallucinatory sculptural portrait of an elderly woman by Ron Mueck, Tom Friedman's actual-size ladybug, Roxy Paine's mushroom field, Michael Combs's carved and painted dead duck, Francis Cape's mysterious cabinet, Vija Celmins's velvety starry sky painting, Robert Gober's folded door and glamorous floor polishers appropriated by Jeff Koons (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>''FUNDAMENTAL OCCURRENCES,'' Malca, 580 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-8854 (through July 29). Seven abstract painters deal personally with the basics of surface, pattern and color. The show includes Robin Bruch's all-over crystalline webs, Eve Sonneman's all-over fields of little circles atop bigger circles, Glenn Goldberg's abstracted blossoms, Harold Porcher's colored stripe permutations, Chris Martin's big and small cosmic boxes on a huge blue canvas, Joe Fyfe's brushy tumbling boxes and Charles Cooper's subtle, gameboard-like watercolors (Johnson).</p>
        <p>LOUIS MONZA, Luise Ross, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 343-2161 (through July 21). The self-taught Monza, who was born in Italy in 1897 and died in California in 1984, was known for his bold and passionate social protest paintings. Late in life, however, his art became otherworldly. His preoccupation with issues like environmental pollution or nuclear disaster persists, but in many of the small drawings from the 60's, 70's and 80's on view here, the serpentine line, radiant light and densely improvised, mythic imagery bespeak a rather psychedelic turn of mind (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''SUMMER SLAM: GRAND NATIONALS,'' Tobey Fine Arts, 580 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 431-7878 (through July 8). The 11 artists in this seasonal roundup were each assigned to make something two feet square. Results include Meredith Allen's seaside photograph of a melting Good Humor bar; an all-over pattern resembling fish-scales by Danielle Mysliwiec; John von Bergen's monstrous tentacles emerging from a two-foot hole in the wall; Katalin Kotvics's mysterious, frosted plastic box; and Joel Holub's pea soup green monochrome (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''SUMMER SHOW,'' DFN, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 334-3400 (through Aug. 18). Mixed in among the 53 works in this cheerfully uneven hodge-podge of a show are pictures of sun bathers by Joan Semmel; a large, darkly expressionistic beach scene in charcoal by Susan Grossman; small, woozily distorted suburban images by Steve Mumford; a gloomy, swampy landscape painted by William McCarthy; and a painting of a naked sunbather with a strategically placed book by Elyse Taylor (Johnson).</p>
        <p>KEVIN WIXTED, David Beitzel, 102 Prince Street, (212) 219-2863 (through July 14). Mr. Wixted's grid-based paintings have vibrant color, thick waxy surfaces, all sorts of patterns and a repeating inventory of symbols, including tulips, hex signs, a cow's head, faces from the Book of Kells and a pine tree. Philip Taaffe and Donald Baechlor come to mind. The paintings have decorative appeal but they could be more surprisingly idiosyncratic (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>DYLAN STONE, Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3335 (through July 7). Mr. Stone has given himself an impressively ambitious if not, on the face of it, deeply meaningful assignment. Over the next few years he intends to take a snapshot of every building in Manhattan. This exhibition includes a set of now mostly empty wooden shelves, for storing the archive as they are filled with completed pictures, and a big blueprint map with finished blocks marked and numbered. So far he's done just the southern tip of the island (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>''AT THE EDGE: A PORTUGUESE FUTURIST -- AMADEO DE SOUZA CARDOSO,'' AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, (212) 554-1704 (through Sept. 16). One of those perfect, dropped-from-the-sky retrospectives, this show introduces a talented and ambitious Portuguese modernist who died in 1918 at the age of 30. In the previous 10 years he had absorbed several budding modern art movements in Paris, especially Cubism and Futurism, combined them with references to things Portuguese and produced vividly colored, carefully calibrated paintings. They seem ahead of their time in their mixing of styles, images, materials and cultural references. His exceptional draftsmanship is shown in a series of ultra-refined drawings that suggest Ingres high on Cubism (Smith).</p>
        <p>ILYA AND EMILIA KABAKOV, ''The Palace of Projects,'' 69th Street Regiment Armory, Lexington Avenue at 26th Street, (212) 980-4575, (through July 10, daily except Tuesdays 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.) Not Mr. Kabakov's best but a big, elaborate installation worth a close look anyway: a huge spiraling temporary pavilion shape like Tatlin's nautilus monument, a striking structure filled with 65 ''projects.'' These are fictive plans in the form of texts accompanied by models that turn the inside of the pavilion into what vaguely resembles a 4-H Club booth at a country fair. The projects are utopian dreams for improving the world, attributed to imaginary characters. There's some rehashing of older work and a little too much reading to absorb, but also compensatory Kabakovian attributes, like the wry absurdist literary style and the melancholic and  humanely nostalgic way of recalling Soviet life by which an art of political opposition is manifested as a kind of Proustian fantasy. Even when not at his most striking, Mr. Kabakov, now teamed with his wife, demonstrates an imagination that few other artists match (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''SHAHZIA SIKANDER: ACTS OF BALANCE,'' Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453 (through July 7). Ms. Sikander has received well-deserved attention for her vivid, complex paintings, which infuse the traditional miniatures of India with a new cross-cultural content. For this exhibition she has expanded her themes into wall paintings veiled with sheets of opaque paper. The results, though ambitious, look obscurant rather than revealing. More successful are three large paintings hung high in the adjoining atrium, which suggest that this gifted artist is trying to move beyond the miniaturist label in what feels like a transitional show (Cotter).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>''ARTISTS OF YADDO: 1965-2000,'' Claudia Carr, 478 West Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 673-5518 (through today). This seven-artist show presents intimate works on paper made at Yaddo, a bucolic artists' retreat in upstate New York. The exhibition includes pastel color fields with cosmic spirals by Jason Stewart, sketchy Mondrianesque studies by Ward Jackson, Tantric-style mandalas by Jeanne Miles, richly colored biomorphic abstractions by Garth Evans, fields of gestural knots by Melissa Meyer and essays in sensuous layering by Garry Mitchell and Darra Keeton. (Johnson).</p>
        <p>WILLEM DE KOONING, ''Mostly Women,'' Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through today). Dominated by de Kooning's lush, disheveled paintings and drawings of women from the middle 1960's, this show has the intimacy and excitement of a visit to the artist's studio. The works, from the collection of John and Kimiko Powers, come in all shapes and sizes and are executed on whatever's-handy surfaces -- from paper towels to hollow-core doors. They are often affectionately inscribed by the artist (Smith).</p>
        <p>JACK EARL, Nancy Margolis, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 343-9523 (through today). Mr. Earl's small, lovingly detailed ceramic narratives center on a bumpkin in blue jeans, red work shirt and red cap named Bill. The most impressive piece combines several scenes into one funny, in-the-round retelling of the Faust myth, in which a stray dog turns into Bill's miniaturized evil twin. It looks like the work of a zany hobbyist and has the uncanny air of a ''Twilight Zone'' episode (Johnson).</p>
        <p>BRENDA JOY LEM, Museum of Chinese in the Americas, 70 Mulberry Street, Chinatown, (212) 619-4785 (through today). It is always a moving experience to visit this small institution. The lantern-shaped central gallery is filled with relics of immigrant life. A second gallery holds new art. On view is work by Ms. Lem, a Chinese-Canadian artist: banners silkscreened with family photographs and handwritten books about the artist's childhood. The spare installation is the visual equivalent of oral history and exactly complements a memory-bank of a museum that exists very much in the present (Cotter).</p>
        <p>HELEN MIRRA, Gasser &amp; Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212) 807-9494 (through July 1) This Chicago-based artist's first New York solo is spare and oblique, but it has a warm and subtle wit (Johnson).</p>
        <p>RICHARD PRINCE, Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9300 (through today). After 20 years, Mr. Prince continues to produce work that disturbs, resists assimilation as art, questions authorship and effectively uses photo appropriation to expose some of the weirder corners of American pop culture. Here he takes (mostly) real publicity photographs of rock 'n' roll, screen and television stars, supplies signatures himself and adds bits of art, his own included. Grouping personalities according to genre, role or appearance, the pieces are about different stereotypes and pop cultural camouflage. They present the artist as ultimate fan, but as the images are all dedicated to him, they also suggest the fan as ultimate star (Smith).</p>
        <p>BARBARA SCHWARTZ, Andre Zarre, 515 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-0202 (through today). Known for her energetic abstract wall sculpture, Ms. Schwartz here shows a series of lively glazed tile paintings made at a ceramics factory in Italy. Ovals and cruciform shapes bearing expressionistically charged Cubist compositions are presented singly or fitted together into complex emblematic configurations that have a certain gaudy, Mediterranean decorative appeal (Johnson).</p>
