        <p>MANHATTAN: HUNGER STRIKE ENDS -- Eight janitors at a Brooklyn office tower ended a three-day hunger strike late Wednesday after City Councilman Guillermo Linares introduced a resolution that would bar city subsidies or tax breaks to building owners who violate the rights of workers. The hunger strikers were among 30 janitors at Brooklyn Renaissance Plaza who went on strike May 16 because the building's owner, Muss Development, refused to allow them to join the Service Employees International Union. Muss officials have denied any wrongdoing.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: PAROLE DENIED -- The Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole yesterday denied parole for Jose A. Ramos, left, a 55-year-old former mental patient who is the prime suspect in what investigators believe is the abduction and murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz. Mr. Ramos is in prison in Pennsylvania for child molestation. Etan vanished in 1979 after leaving his parents' SoHo loft to walk to his school bus.</p>

        <p>BRONX: MAN KILLED BY TRAIN -- An unidentified man was killed yesterday by a southbound Metro-North Railroad train near the Fordham station in the Bronx, the authorities said. The incident occurred at 6:20 a.m., canceling or delaying 120 trains on the Harlem and New Haven lines and disrupting service for more than 40,000 riders. Daniel Brucker, a railroad spokesman, said the man ''was apparently standing right in the tracks, between the two rails, facing the train.''</p>

        <p>VALHALLA: OFFICERS PLEAD GUILTY -- Two correction officers at the Westchester County Jail pleaded guilty on Wednesday to federal narcotics charges. The officers, Bradley Belcher and Yvette Washington, were arrested April 6 after a 13-month federal investigation. A federal inmate cooperating with the authorities bribed the officers to get a substance he said was heroin from a ''relative'' and pass it on to him. The supposed relative was an undercover agent, prosecutors said. Each officer faces a maximum of 15 years in prison.</p>

        <p>SYRACUSE: ILLEGAL COMMERCE -- A man who admitted illegally trading with North Koreans has been sentenced to home detention and ordered to forfeit $181,000 in illegal proceeds, federal officials said yesterday. The man, Lorand Ernyey, 46, of Skaneateles, must serve six months of home detention and three years of probation, work 200 hours of community service and pay a $100 fine, the Inspector General's Syracuse office said. Over a five-year period, Mr. Ernyey's business, American Export Trading Company, sent 29 shipments of goods to North Koreans living in Hungary.</p>

        <p>CLINTON: MAN IMPALED -- A New London man, Ronald Nichols, 51, died early yesterday after his leg was impaled on the fork of a forklift in the Genco/Unilever warehouse on Route 145, the police said. After ambulance workers freed Mr. Nichols from the forklift, he was flown by helicopter to Hartford Hospital, where he died shortly before 3 a.m., the police said. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration was expected to investigate.</p>

        <p>NEW LONDON: HOSPITAL SETTLES -- The family of a woman who wandered from a Norwich hospital and died in the woods has settled its malpractice suit for $1.4 million. The state and William W. Backus Hospital will pay the family of Sarah B. Morse, who was admitted to Backus in February 1995 and was supposed to have round-the-clock supervision. The woman's supervisor was talking on the telephone when Ms. Morse walked out of the hospital on March 1, 1995. She died sometime later of hypothermia, according to the suit.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: PRISON GUARD FIRED -- An injury to an inmate at the Cheshire Correctional Institution has led to the firing of a prison guard and an investigation into the use of excessive force by others. The inmate, Joseph Tracy of Bridgeport, was restrained and beaten last January. His father, Thomas Tracy Sr., said that at least one inmate ''saw a guard take Joe's head and pound it into the wall.'' The names of the guards have not been released.</p>

        <p>FRANKLIN: MURDER SITE DEMOLISHED -- Two weeks after the town council voted to demolish the house where the so-called pizza murders took place, a wrecking crew yesterday brought down the brown shingle house on Scott Road. In 1997, two teenagers, Thomas Koskovich and Jayson Vreeland, used the abandoned house and murdered Giorgio Gallara and Jeremy Giordano, whom they had lured by ordering a pizza for delivery. Mr. Koskovich, 22, and Mr. Vreeland, 20, were convicted of murder.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: BANKING CHIEF SWORN IN -- Karen L. Suter was sworn in yesterday as New Jersey's commissioner of banking and insurance, succeeding her boss, Jaynee LaVecchia, who was appointed to the State Supreme Court in January. Ms. Suter, 43, of Medford, was a deputy state attorney general for insurance matters from 1991 to 1998, when she joined the Department of Banking and Insurance as Ms. LaVecchia's deputy. Her new job pays $115,000.</p>

        <p>HACKENSACK: WEDDING-DAY MURDER -- Agustin Garcia, left, the Dominican business leader who, the police say, gunned down his former girlfriend on the day she was to marry another man, has been indicted on murder charges. A Bergen County grand jury returned a seven-count indictment yesterday against Mr. Garcia, 48. The woman, Gladys Ricart, 39, was shot on Sept. 26, 1999, in her Ridgefield home. Lawyers for Mr. Garcia say she was killed accidentally during a struggle over the gun.</p>

        <p>CAMDEN: RABBI'S MURDER CASE The lawyer for Rabbi Fred J. Neulander of Cherry Hill, who is accused of plotting to have his wife killed, has requested a court order to compel a reporter from The Philadelphia Inquirer to turn over her notes on the case. The reporter, Nancy Phillips, has written extensively about the 1994 killing of the rabbi's wife, Carol Neulander, and has included information provided by Len Jenoff, a private investigator who admitted that he and an accomplice beat Carol Neulander to death.</p>
