        <p>For the last two weeks, Hillary Rodham Clinton has attacked Representative Rick A.

        <p>For the last two weeks, Hillary Rodham Clinton has attacked Representative Rick A. Lazio for missing a vote in Congress to create a home heating oil reserve so he could fly back home to campaign in New York. The measure failed by two votes, a point Mrs. Clinton has made in speeches and television advertisements belittling her opponent in the race for the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign acknowledged yesterday that on the night of the vote, she was at the side of another errant New York representative, Eliot L. Engel, a Bronx Democrat who had left Washington early to tend to his own political needs: a fund-raiser in Westchester. And Mr. Lazio seized the information yesterday, attacking Mrs. Clinton as a ''hypocrite'' and demanding that she stop running ads attacking him.</p>
        <p>''It is just the height of political chutzpah to go on the attack, air commercials, and pretend that she had a role other than what she had,'' Mr. Lazio said in a telephone call from Washington. ''Obviously the entire attack on her part was disingenuous. I think it goes back to the central question of truth and truthfulness.''</p>
        <p>''There's a huge question of hypocrisy here,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's advisers said the first lady had been unaware that the vote was going on when she appeared at Mr. Engel's fund-raiser on June 15, and Mr. Engel said he, too, was unaware of the vote that night. Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said Mrs. Clinton first learned that the fund-raiser coincided with the vote from a campaign briefing column that appeared in Newsday on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfson, who declined to say when he learned of the confluence of the Engel fund-raiser and the vote, said that the first lady had no intention of ending her attacks or withdrawing the television commercial in question. He scoffed at Mr. Lazio's labeling of Mrs. Clinton as a hypocrite.</p>
        <p>''The ad would have gone up and it is definitely staying up,'' Mr. Wolfson said. ''He still hasn't apologized for missing the vote. He's a member of Congress. You're supposed to vote.''</p>
        <p>But in an interview, Mr. Engel pointedly declined to back the Clinton campaign's point of view. He said he did not believe Mr. Lazio had done anything wrong, and that House Republican leaders were to blame for changing the schedule without notifying members.</p>
        <p>Mr. Engel said he had left Washington in mid-afternoon after being assured by the Republican leadership that Congress would adjourn by 6 p.m. As it turned out, the House stayed in session into the night.</p>
        <p>Asked if he thought Mrs. Clinton's criticism of Mr. Lazio was fair, Mr. Engel responded: ''I don't know -- you know, that's a Senate campaign; they've got to resolve that.''</p>
        <p>''I'm not critical of anyone for missing that vote,'' Mr. Engel continued. ''I think any vote that comes up after 6 p.m., when they tell you it's going to be over at 6 p.m. -- people set up alternative things to do. I criticize the Republican leadership.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio took the 9 p.m. shuttle back to New York that night in order to be on the ground Friday morning for a day of campaigning. The disclosure that he missed the vote has become an issue both because of the closeness of the outcome and because he has been attacking the Clinton administration for escalating fuel costs. The missed vote has not only given Mrs. Clinton a campaign issue, but will also make it more difficult for Mr. Lazio to leave Washington while Congress is in session so he can tend to his campaign.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, Mr. Lazio's aides reacted with relief upon learning where Mrs. Clinton had been that night, and moved quickly to try to stoke media interest in the report. ''Scoop city!'' Mike Murphy, Mr. Lazio's chief media adviser, said in a voice-mail message left for a reporter. ''This is a huge hypocrite thing. She's running a TV ad on it. We demand that she pull it.''</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Lazio said he could not recall whether he knew the vote was about to happen when he left Washington. (An aide later called to say that Mr. Lazio had been told it was possible, but not certain, that it was going to come up.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said he did not believe that Mrs. Clinton was unaware of Mr. Engel's missing the vote when she began attacking Mr. Lazio for being absent. ''It's plain she knew about it before she was airing attack ads.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfson said he saw no inconsistency in Mrs. Clinton's decision to  attack Mr. Lazio for missing the vote without saying anything about Mr. Engel. ''Neither one of us remember anyone other than Rick Lazio pointing fingers at the administration, attacking the administration's oil policy, claiming this was one of his top priorities, and then missing the vote,'' Mr. Wolfson said. ''No one else here is the issue but Rick Lazio, and he didn't vote.''</p>
