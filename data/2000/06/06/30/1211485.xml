        <p>The Class A ships represent 19 nations and, in their histories, a wide variety of seagoing purposes. Among the Class B vessels are replicas of the Amistad, a ship seized in 1839 by slaves it carried; the Half Moon, in which Henry Hudson discovered the river now bearing his name; and Providence, a fighting sloop commanded by John Paul Jones during the Revolutionary War.</p>
        <p>1. EAGLE, United States:  This white steel-hulled bark, the host vessel for Operation Sail, is the United States' most famous tall ship. Built as a school ship in 1936 at Blohm &amp; Voss in Hamburg, Germany, the ship was acquired by the United States as part of war reparations and commissioned for the training of Coast Guard cadets in 1946. The Eagle has three sister ships, including Germany's Gorch Fock (No. 21 in the Parade of Sail). The three steel decks are covered with teak; the figurehead is a golden eagle. Crew: 212. Length: 295 feet.</p>
        <p>2. DANMARK, Denmark:  This white steel-hulled, full-rigged training ship, built in 1932, visited the New York World's Fair in 1939 and was in Florida when Germany invaded Denmark. During World War II, the captain offered the Danmark's services to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Coast Guard used the ship for training, leading to its decision to acquire the Eagle after the Danmark sailed home in 1945 and was recommissioned as a merchant marine school ship. The figurehead is a gilded sea god. Crew: 99. Length: 253 feet.</p>
        <p>3. POGORIA, Poland:  A barkentine built in Gdynia in 1980, Pogoria carries a broad blue stripe the length of its sides and foresails adorned with the symbol of Poland's Iron Shackle Fraternity. It has sailed around the world and can log 200 sea miles in a day. Crew: 50. Length: 154 feet.</p>
        <p>4. NIAGARA, United States:  One of two brigs built in Erie, Pa., during the War of 1812 to oppose the British in the Great Lakes, the Niagara was part of a fleet of nine small ships that defeated the British squadron and captured six British vessels near Put-in-Bay, Ohio, in September 1813. Scuttled in 1820, raised in 1913 and restored over many years, the ship was relaunched at Erie in 1988, on the battle's 175th anniversary. Crew: 42. Length: 198 feet.</p>
        <p>5. GUAYAS, Ecuador:  This bark is one of four sister ships built in Bilbao, Spain, by Astilleros y Talleres Celaya for the navies of Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico and Ecuador. On its maiden voyage in 1978, it sailed all the way around South America, navigating both the Straits of Magellan and the Panama Canal. The Guayas is named for the first steamship built in South Amer  ica. Crew: 104. Length: 258 feet.</p>
        <p>6. ROSE, United States:  This full-rigged ship, built in 1970 in Lunenberg, Nova Scotia, is a replica of a British frigate that patrolled the American colonies in 1775 and was part of the fleet that attacked New York in 1776. The new Rose is the largest active wooden tall ship in the world, logging thousands of sea miles a year as a training ship for mariners and civilians. Crew: 57. Length: 179 feet.</p>
        <p>7. SAGRES, Portugal:  Easily identified by the large red crosses on the main and foresails, this three-masted steel barkentine was built for the German Navy in 1937. It was damaged in World War II, taken by the United States and then passed on to Brazil and renamed the Guanabara. In 1961, the ship went to the Portuguese, who, like the Brazilians, use it for training. The Sagres has taken part in every Operation Sail. Crew: 165. Length: 294 feet.</p>
        <p>8. OOSTERSCHELDE, Netherlands:  Built in Rotterdam, its current home port, and launched in 1918, this three-masted topsail schooner transported cargo around Europe, Africa and the Mediterranean. It became a motor vessel in 1930 and remained so, under Danish and Swedish ownership, until 1988, when it was brought home and restored. The Oosterschelde is the last representative of the large fleet of Dutch schooners from the early 20th century. Crew: 38 Length: 164 feet.</p>
        <p>9. KALMAR NYCKEL, United States:  Built in 1997 in Wilmington, Del., this Dutch pinnace is a replica of the vessel that, under Peter Minuit, brought the first Swedish settlers (as well as Germans, Finns and Dutch) to the Delaware Bay area in 1638. The ship returned three times to support what became the first European settlement in the Delaware Valley. Later it served in the Swedish Navy and was lost off the city of Kalmar in the late 17th century. Crew: 25 Length: 162 feet.</p>
        <p>10. EUROPA, Netherlands:  Built in Germany in 1911, this historic bark was totally restored, with notably fine accommodations, in Amsterdam from 1988 to 1994. It is now a sail training vessel and regularly joins cruising events worldwide. Crew: 64. Length: 185 feet.</p>
        <p>11. GAZELA OF PHILADELPHIA, United States:  This three-masted barkentine, built in 1883, is believed to be the oldest and largest wood-hulled square-rigger still putting out to sea. It was built in Portugal with timber from trees said to have been planted in the 15th century for Prince Henry the Navigator, and much of the oak and shipbuilding pine in the hull is original. Last of the Portuguese sail fishing fleet, the Gazela harvested cod on the Grand Banks until 1969. It is now owned by the Port of History Museum in Philadelphia. Crew: 35. Length: 178 feet.</p>
        <p>12. KAIWO MARU, Japan:  This four-masted bark was built in Japan in 1989 to replace an earlier Kaiwo Maru that trained merchant marine cadets for more than 50 years. It is owned by the Institute for Sea Training of Japan's Ministry of Transport and now trains civilians and cadets. The name means King of the Sea. Crew: 141. Length: 361 feet.</p>
        <p>13. CISNE BRANCO, Brazil:  A full-rigged ship, the Cisne Branco was built in the Netherlands and delivered to the Brazilian Navy in late 1999 to serve as a training vessel, the largest built to date. The hull color matches the name, which means White Swan. Crew: 88. Length: 249 feet</p>
        <p>14. CAPIT'AN MIRANDA, Uruguay:  This three-masted staysail schooner was built in Matagorda, Uruguay, in 1930 as a cargo carrier. After World War II, it operated as a power vessel with the rig removed. In the 1960's, it was a research vessel for the Uruguayan Navy, and in 1978 it was refitted with a rig developed for racing yachts in the 1920's. Crew: 95. Length: 209 feet.</p>
        <p>15. ESMERALDA, Chile:  This four-masted barkentine, built in Spain in 1952, is sister to Juan Sebastian de Elcano (No. 22 in the Parade of Sail), although their rigs differ slightly. Both vessels are reminiscent of the four-masted cargo schooners launched in the early 20th century for the United States coastal trade. The deck layout includes a very long forecastle and a navigating bridge amidships. The Esmeralda is now a training ship for the Chilean Navy. The steel hull is white; the figurehead is an Andean condor. Crew: 338. Length: 371 feet.</p>
        <p>16. SIM'ON BOL'IVAR, Venezuela:  This Spanish-built, three-masted bark, launched in 1980, is named for the hero of the revolutions that won independence from Spain for six Latin American nations. The figurehead, symbolizing Liberty, shows a woman draped in Bol'ivar's flag and holding a sword. The ship is a navy training vessel, with false gun ports painted in black on the white steel hull. Crew: 180. Length: 270 feet.</p>
        <p>17. DAR MLODZIEZY, Poland:  This full-rigged ship, built in 1982, is Poland's principal sail-training vessel. It can carry more sail than any other tall ship except the Wavertree (No. 27 in the Parade of Sail). The name means The Gift of Youth. Crew: 152. Length: 357 feet.</p>
        <p>18. LIBERTAD, Argentina:  This full-rigged training vessel of the Argentine Navy, built in La Plata in 1962, is one of the world's largest and fastest sailing-school ships. It has a white steel hull, a flush deck with a pilothouse forward of the main mast, a wide bridge and an exhaust funnel between the main and mizzen masts. The Libertad has participated in every Operation Sail. Crew: 320. Length: 345 feet.</p>
        <p>19. DEWARUCI, Indonesia:  This German-built barkentine, the Indonesian Navy's training vessel, comes to New York by way of the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic; to return home, it will take the Panama Canal and then cross the Pacific Ocean. Named for a Hindu sea god in ''The Mahabarata,'' it represents a nation that still boasts a fleet of sailing cargo schooners. Crew: 152. Length: 191 feet.</p>
        <p>20. AMERIGO VESPUCCI, Italy:  This full-rigged ship, built in Italy in 1931, is prized for its elegant interior, especially the captain's cabin, and has quarters for more than 500. It is one of the largest vessels in Operation Sail and, at 52 feet, the widest. The high-sided design is patterned after an 18th-century frigate with two gun decks, but the hull is steel and the ship carries no guns. It is the sail-training ship of the Italian Naval Academy. Crew: 480. Length: 331 feet.</p>
        <p>21. GORCH FOCK, Germany:  This steel bark, named for a German poet killed while serving as a World War I seaman, was built in 1958 as a training ship for the West German Navy by the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg, which also produced the Eagle and two other sister ships. It has square-rigged fore and main masts and a fore-and-aft rigged mizzenmast with topsail. Crew: 225. Length: 293 feet.</p>
        <p>22. JUAN SEBASTIAN DE ELCANO, Spain:  This four-masted topsail schooner, built in Bilbao and sister ship to Esmeralda (No. 15 in the Parade of Sail), is named for the commander of the only galleon that returned from Magellan's expedition in 1522. It has been a training ship for the Spanish navy for most of its 59 years and has circumnavigated the globe six times. Crew: 315. Length: 371 feet.</p>
        <p>23. GLORIA, Colombia:  This three-masted bark, built in 1968 in Spain, is the smallest and oldest of four sister ships, including Guayas (No. 5 in the Parade of Sail) and the Sim'on Bol'ivar (No. 16). It is the sail-training vessel of the Colombian Naval Academy. The Gloria has a white steel hull with a rounded stern, an enclosed pilothouse and a winged figurehead. Crew: 160. Length: 249 feet.</p>
        <p>24. EENDRACHT, Netherlands:  This three-masted gaff schooner, built in Gorinchem in 1989, is operated by the Sailing School Foundation in the Hague. It is a fast ship: in a wind force of 17 to 20 knots, with six- to eight-foot waves, it has easily sailed at 14 knots. Crew: 56. Length: 194 feet.</p>
        <p>25. BLUENOSE II, Canada:  This gaff-rigged schooner was built in 1963 from the same plans, and by the same Lunenberg builder, as the original Bluenose, a Nova Scotia fishing schooner and racer known as the Queen of the North Atlantic in the 1920's and 30's. Bluenose, an old nickname for Nova Scotians, refers to a locally grown blue-skinned potato. Crew: 18 Length: 161 feet.</p>
        <p>26. PICTON CASTLE, New Zealand:  Built in England in 1928, this white-hulled, square-rigged bark visits Operation Sail 2000 before setting off on an 18-month voyage around the world in November, with the officers and a carefully selected crew of 34. Home port is Lunenberg, Nova Scotia. Crew: 47. Length: 176 feet.</p>
        <p>27. WAVERTREE, United States:  One of the last large wrought-iron sailing ships built, the Wavertree is the largest still afloat. Built in 1885 in Southampton, England, for the India trade, the ship eventually hauled cargo all over the world. In 1968 it was bought by the South Street Seaport Museum, where restoration is in progress. The Wavertree draws only 11 feet -- very little for so large a ship -- and can carry more sail than any other ship in Operation Sail 2000, though in its present state it will probably parade under courses fore and aft, and topsails. Crew: 55. Length: 325 feet.</p>
