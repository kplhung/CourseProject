        <p>Doctors who perform abortions as part of their regular medical practices said yesterday that they were greatly relieved by the decision of the Supreme Court that the government could not prohibit doctors from performing a procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. They said that laws trying to ban the procedure were so vague that doctors performing almost any abortion could be prosecuted under them.</p>
        <p>The doctors said that medically,  there is no such procedure as a partial-birth abortion, calling the term a political label. The Nebraska law struck down by the court described a partial-birth abortion as one in which part of the fetus was outside the woman's body before the fetus was killed. The doctors said many types of abortion could fit that description.</p>

        <p>Doctors who perform abortions as part of their regular medical practices said yesterday that they were greatly relieved by the decision of the Supreme Court that the government could not prohibit doctors from performing a procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. They said that laws trying to ban the procedure were so vague that doctors performing almost any abortion could be prosecuted under them.</p>
        <p>The doctors said that medically,  there is no such procedure as a partial-birth abortion, calling the term a political label. The Nebraska law struck down by the court described a partial-birth abortion as one in which part of the fetus was outside the woman's body before the fetus was killed. The doctors said many types of abortion could fit that description.</p>
        <p>Dr. William F. Harrison of the  Washington Medical Center in Fayetteville, Ark., said that when the Arkansas Legislature banned the procedure, he was not concerned because he did abortions only up to 18 weeks of pregnancy after the woman's last period, or in rare cases a few weeks after that. But on reading the law, Dr. Harrison said, it became clear that the statute was so broadly written that it could apply to many abortions he performed.</p>
        <p>Gloria Feldt, head of the national Planned Parenthood, said that ''we are pleased with the court's affirmation'' of the right to abortion, ''but we in no way believe this is the end.'' Ms. Feldt added, ''We know there will be another generation of bills, in which they will try over and over again to establish that legislatures can outlaw specific medical procedures at  any time during pregnancy.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Frederick Hopkins, an obstetrician in San Diego who also serves as an officer of Planned Parenthood there, said one of the troubling aspects of the campaign against so-called partial-birth abortion was that while it was a threat to any doctor who performed abortions, it had no basis in medicine. ''There is no such thing as partial-birth abortion,'' Dr. Hopkins said. ''It is not in any medical text and there is no medical definition.'' Yet it is ''intimidating and frightening,'' he said, ''to think a doctor could have been prosecuted  under such vague language.''</p>
        <p>Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right To Life Committee, said that he was disappointed with the court decision but that efforts would continue to get a law passed to ban ''partial-birth abortions,'' one that would meet the  approval of the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson said that new, more specific language had been written into more recent bills being introduced in Congress and state legislatures that might help to overcome the objection of vagueness expressed by the court's majority.</p>
        <p>On the court's other objection, that the law did not include any exception that might allow abortion if the health of the mother was threatened, he said that there was no remedy for that.</p>
