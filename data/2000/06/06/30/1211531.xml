        <p>NISSAN'S television commercials have made Jerry Hirshberg the most recognized auto designer in America. More than his Infiniti J30 luxury sedan, his Nissan Xterra sport utility or even his strange Gobi truck design, they are likely to be the images by which he is remembered.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirshberg's career at Nissan comes to an end today with his voluntary retirement; he turns 60 tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirshberg came to Nissan in 1980, when the Japanese company set up a Southern California studio, Nissan Design International, or N.D.I., to learn from the American market. Most automakers have California studios now, but Nissan's was among the first. And Mr. Hirshberg was determined to design all kinds of products, which he believed improved the quality of his automotive designs.</p>
        <p>His interest in other products has helped to make Mr. Hirshberg a polarizing figure in auto design. He has also been one of the industry's most outspoken and articulate practitioners; his explanations of his own work are sometimes taken as glibness. Auto design is a hermetic world of traditions and conventions, not unlike that of Paris couture or Japanese anime. The true car designer, tradition holds, dreams of nothing else -- he has ''gasoline in his veins.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hirshberg has always had a variety of artistic interests and abilities. General Motors hired him in 1963 in a program aimed at enriching the pool of ideas by bringing designers without automotive backgrounds into the studio.</p>
        <p>His career had already taken an odd detour while he was earning degrees in mechanical engineering from Ohio State University and in industrial design from the Cleveland Institute of Art. He moved from the classical music of his high school years into rock 'n' roll and in 1959 had a hit song, ''Sparkling Blue.'' Using the name Jerry Paul, he toured as an opening act for the likes of Fabian and Frankie Avalon. ''Sparkling Blue,'' he proudly says, continued to be played on oldies stations and produce residual payments into the 1980's.</p>
        <p>But he gave up music for automobile design, joining G.M.'s Pontiac Division in the 60's when its general manager, John Z. DeLorean, was making waves. Mr. Hirshberg worked on the original Firebird of 1967 and the striking 1968 GTO muscle car, then moved on to Buick. Through it all, he worked under the legendary (and tyrannical) Bill Mitchell, who encouraged competition among G.M.'s disparate design studios. But Mr. Hirshberg thought the competition intimidated designers and squelched new ideas. The very names of cars he worked on -- LeSabre, Firebird -- summed up the aggressive ethos of the place, he said.</p>
        <p>In 1979, he got a call from a headhunter. Nissan had decided to establish a studio in California to adapt vehicle designs to the increasingly important American market; would he set it up? Once he got Nissan Design International going, in the LaJolla section of San Diego, he worked to redesign the process of design. He laid out some of his ideas in a 1998 book, ''The Creative Priority: Driving Innovation in the Real World'' (HarperBusiness), whose pages are full of phrases like ''mind mapping,'' ''porous planning'' and ''polarized thinking.'' California psychobabble, his Detroit critics grumbled, though not on the record.</p>
        <p>Today, he calls the studio itself his most successful design. But his style is unconventional. Once, to break a midafternoon creative logjam, he took his entire staff to a screening of ''Silence of the Lambs.'' He administered a test to determine the ''colors'' of potential staffers' personalities, lest the organizing greens be overwhelmed by innovative but helter-skelter reds.</p>
        <p>To keep minds open and ideas fresh, N.D.I. also took on a variety of nonautomotive design work, from children's furniture to laptop computers, yachts and golf clubs. (Its most commercially successful project may not be a car, but the best-selling Taylor Made Bubble Burner golf clubs.)</p>
        <p>Another nonautomotive job was a commission to rethink the design of The Los Angeles Times. Beginning with the basics, he concluded that a person reading a newspaper ''appears to be smelling it.'' He ground several metropolitan dailies into confetti and asked a panel to evaluate their odors. The Los Angeles paper did very well; testers called its smell ''sweet.'' (In the interest of full disclosure, it should be noted that The New York Times rated less well, due to a higher percentage of recycled paper.)</p>
        <p>His innovations have sometimes been small but significant. As the studio set out to redesign the Quest minivan, word came back that users wanted 3 inches of added space. The specific figure puzzled him. Bringing in owners and their vehicles, Mr. Hirshberg found that what they really wanted was room to accommodate objects, like another row of grocery bags, without adding to the van's length. So the studio added storage in the form of an adjustable shelf -- a feature that has been widely imitated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirshberg is famous for the verbal spin he puts on his designs. He called the Xterra, a small sport utility that has been a big hit since its introduction last year, ''a garage tool that says, 'Treat me rough' -- it's designed to look better dirty than clean.''</p>
        <p>When the Infiniti J30 made its premiere, he says, ''I presented the car at the Waldorf-Astoria like a Hollywood director.'' The sedan was conceived in the mid-80's in an effort to create ''instant heritage'' for Nissan's new luxury division. The studio came up with a series of round shapes that, in an era when most cars were wedges, evoked the falling rear ends and rounded coachlike bodies of old Jaguars and Delahayes.</p>
        <p>At the J30's introduction, he presented the design theme as a Zen-like drawing: a bold, calligraphic sketch of a line and an egg.</p>
        <p>New vehicles based on Mr. Hirshberg's designs will arrive in showrooms until 2003, and he will continue to appear in ads. He turned down a chance to become worldwide director for Nissan design, he says. That job went to Shiro Nakamura, formerly of Isuzu, whom Mr. Hirshberg recommended. Heading Nissan Design in California will be Tom Semple, a longtime colleague.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirshberg's last major design at Nissan Design International is the American studio's entry in an intramural competition for the design of Nissan's next ''Z'' sports car. It will compete with an entry from Nissan's Japanese studio, and the winner will be displayed at the Detroit auto show in January. Mr. Hirshberg promises that the Z will be very different from a design shown in Detroit two years ago. It will not be a ''retro'' version of the old Z car, he says.</p>
        <p>''Retro lost its edge when we crossed the millennial threshold,'' he said. ''Now we run the danger of cars becoming costumes on wheels.'' He considers it good for automotive design ''to become aware of its history -- for cars to begin referencing other cars for a change, not rocket ships or airplanes.'' But he says auto designers may ''squander this new credibility very rapidly.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''How long can a wink last? The danger is that we will visually giggle ourselves back into oblivion.'' He criticizes the popular Chrysler PT Cruiser as a pastiche of retro references.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirshberg will continue to work as an adviser to Nissan. But he plans to spend most of his time painting. Not with a spray can, as in a recent ad for the Sentra compact sedan, but with oils.</p>
        <p>''There's been this huge white canvas in my studio for 20 years,'' he said. Devoting himself to painting ''was a dream from the days I first began working at General Motors.'' And if that doesn't work, he can always go back to rock 'n' roll.</p>
