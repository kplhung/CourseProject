        <p>Now Playing</p>
        <p>''BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE,'' starring Martin Lawrence. Directed by Raja Gosnell (PG-13, 97 minutes). This fitfully amusing film, starring the comic whirligig Mr. Lawrence, could best be described as ''Stakeout'' goes ghetto, with a touch of ''Tootsie'' for flava -- er, flavor. Mr. Lawrence plays Malcolm, an F.B.I. agent with a penchant for doing undercover work in full body makeup. Here he impersonates Big Momma, a stubborn old Southern woman. Why? Big Momma's granddaughter is on the run because her ex-boyfriend, Lester, a murderous bank robber, has escaped from prison. Malcolm believes he can use her to get to Lester. This isn't much of a movie; it looks like a series of baseball card shots and may have the worst rhythms ever in a film directed by a former editor (Elvis Mitchell).</p>

        <p>''BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE,'' starring Martin Lawrence. Directed by Raja Gosnell (PG-13, 97 minutes). This fitfully amusing film, starring the comic whirligig Mr. Lawrence, could best be described as ''Stakeout'' goes ghetto, with a touch of ''Tootsie'' for flava -- er, flavor.

Big Momma's granddaughter is on the run because her ex-boyfriend, Lester, a murderous bank robber, has escaped from prison. Malcolm believes he can use her to get to Lester. This isn't much of a movie; it looks like a series of baseball card shots and may have the worst rhythms ever in a film directed by a former editor (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''BUTTERFLY,'' starring Fernando Fernan Gomez and Manuel Lozano. Directed by Jose Luis Cuerda (R, 96 minutes). This gentle, devastating new film, based on stories by the Spanish writer Manuel Rivas, tells the story of Moncho (Mr. Lozano), a sensitive young boy coming of age in the months before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. The movie touches on the usual excitements and mysteries of childhood, but Moncho's relationship with his teacher, the proudly Republican Don Gregorio, beautifully played by Mr. Fernan Gomez, gives the story an unusual degree of pathos and political complexity (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>''CHICKEN RUN,'' with the voices of Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson and Julia Sawalha. Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park (G, 86 minutes). The first full-length feature from Aardman Animation is immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film that credits youngsters' interest in a cartoon more substantial than the standard bland musical. The movie employs modeled latex figures to tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Nick Park, who also directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses a continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority. ''Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ''Stalag 17'' to ''Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Mr. Gibson, the voice of Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the hens to fly. Finally, it shows that the hens can save themselves through the pluck of Ginger (Ms. Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal of this (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''DINOSAUR,'' with the voices of D. B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard and Ossie Davis. Directed by Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton (PG, 90 minutes). Reputedly the most expensive animated feature ever made, Disney's showcase of computer animation technology begins with a breathtaking sequence, a visual and sonic extravaganza that the rest of the movie never quite lives up to. The story, of a young dinosaur raised by lemurs who must lead a herd of his fellow reptiles to safety after an asteroid strikes the earth, is cobbled from other Disney plots. But the effects -- the dinosaur's movements and their nearly seamless insertion into real locations -- will impress skeptical grown-ups. And despite some potentially upsetting scenes of carnivorous mayhem, the film will delight children (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>''FANTASIA/2000,'' with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The millennial version of Disney's 1940 groundbreaking fusion of animation and classical music includes seven new segments and keeps one from the original film (the wonderful ''Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' starring Mickey Mouse). ''Fantasia/2000'' is more backward-looking than futuristic. The two best segments are ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' a witty Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld set to the music of Gershwin, and the finale (set to Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' Suite), in which a cometlike sprite whooshes around the globe explosively creating, destroying and renewing the planet's life forms (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''FREQUENCY,'' starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel. Directed by Gregory Hoblit (PG-13, 100 minutes). ''Back to the Future'' meets ''Field of Dreams'' meets ''It's a Wonderful Life'' meets ''The Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but shamelessly sentimental supernatural soap opera with a macho heart. Mr. Caviezel is a morose young policeman who makes contact with his dead father, a firefighter, on a ham radio and contrives to save him from the accident that cost him his life. The two collaborate on changing other aspects of the past and on catching a serial killer. There are enough testosterone tears to soak Shea Stadium (Holden).</p>
        <p>''GLADIATOR,'' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott (R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no one bothered to ask: what would happen if someone decided to film the imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel commercial? Mr. Scott subjects action-packed bouts of mayhem and decapitation in the Roman Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman directing style; it is admirable but repellent. As the noble Roman general who ends up fighting for his life, Mr. Crowe gives a performance with ball-of-fire intensity suffused with a movie star's impatience. He holds the movie together, such as it is (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''GONE IN 60 SECONDS,'' starring Nicolas Cage, Giovanni Ribisi, Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall. Directed by Dominic Sena (PG-13, 119 minutes). A remake of a movie so insubstantial that its title seems to refer to the length of time it would linger in memory. Mr. Cage, who has gone prematurely blond, is the world's best car thief, dragged out of his apparently lucrative go-cart business and returns to auto theft to save the life of his brother (Mr. Ribisi). With a magnetic cast of crooks and cops, it's mindless hot-rodding entertainment (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''HIGH FIDELITY,'' starring John Cusack, Jill Peterson, Iben Hjejle and Joan Cusack. Directed by Stephen Frears (R, 107 minutes). Although the setting has been moved from London to Chicago, the screen adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling 1995 novel is wonderfully true to the spirit of the book. Mr. Cusack has one of his juiciest roles in Rob, a 30-something record store manager and vinyl fanatic sorting through the ''Top 5'' breakups in his disastrous romantic history while trying to salvage his latest relationship. The movie hilariously captures the mind-set of not-so-young men for whom pop music is a kind of religion and hip musical taste an ultimate measure of a person's worth (Holden).</p>
        <p>''ME, MYSELF AND IRENE,'' starring Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger. Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly (R, 100 minutes). If ''There's Something About Mary'' offended you with its callous mockery of hair and pet care and its whimsical views of stalking and serial killing, then this latest festival of vulgarity from the Farrelly brothers will make you miserable. But ''Me Myself and Irene'' shares with their earlier movies a kind of dopey, boyish sincerity and a good-natured sympathy for the underdog that may prove capable of winning over even the dourest spirits. Mr. Carrey, in one -- or is it two? -- of his most charming and repellent performances, plays a Rhode Island state trooper with a split personality and a giant crush on Irene, played with winning moxie and plausible bewilderment by Ms. Zellweger (Scott).</p>
        <p>''M:I-2,'' starring Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton and Sir Anthony Hopkins. Directed by John Woo (PG-13, 120 minutes). Mr. Cruise returns as the daredevil secret agent Ethan Hunt in Mr. Woo's loud, flashy, incoherent new blockbuster. The film is jampacked with movie references -- to Hitchcock, to the first ''Mission: Impossible'' movie and to Mr. Woo's superior Hong Kong action films -- but it's at once overheated and flat. The plot, involving killer viruses, is baffling rather than twisty. The introduction of a love interest (Ms. Newton) who also happens to be the bad guy's ex-girlfriend adds an element of melodrama that's more grating than affecting. Some good car chases and explosions, though (Scott).</p>
        <p>''SHAFT,'' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Christian Bale, Toni Collette and Richard Roundtree. A sequel/remake to the 1971 semi-classic, starring the always dependable Mr. Jackson. He's the nephew of the original Shaft (Mr. Roundtree, who appears briefly), and this time, Shaft is a cop. He leaves the force the track down a racist WASP murderer (Mr. Bale), who joins forces with a drug dealer (the flamboyant and skillful Mr. Wright) to eliminate the hero. This may be the least politically correct movie in some time, and though it tries to convert archetype into stereotype, it doesn't succeed. Watching the two villains squabble for center stage is like watching Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo in a death match for the mike. But Mr. Jackson comes out on top of this emptily entertaining hodgepodge of retro and modern cliches. (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''SHANGHAI NOON,'' starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. Directed by Tom Dey (PG-13, 110 minutes). Mr. Chan is one of the great physical comedians, and this martial arts western spoof is a high-spirited, marvelously silly showcase for his talents. Mr. Chan plays an Imperial Guard dispatched from Beijing to the Old West to rescue a princess played by Lucy Liu. But the heart of the movie is the interplay between Mr. Chan and Mr. Wilson, who depicts his inept outlaw sidekick with goofy, spacey charm (Scott).</p>
        <p>''SUNSHINE,'' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer Ehle, Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 180 minutes). In Mr. Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history, Mr. Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family -- grandfather, father and son -- who endure the corruption of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the viciousness of fascism and the brutality of Communism. Mr. Fiennes's performances, and those of Ms. Ehle and Ms. Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life) help save the film from melodramatic excess. ''Sunshine'' is a serious, humane and thought-provoking attempt to make sense of complicated and painful historical experiences (Scott).</p>
        <p>''TITAN A.E.,'' with the voices of Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore and Bill Pullman. Directed by Don Bluth and Gary Coleman (PG, 90 minutes). This animated sci-fi fantasy, set in the 31st century, imagines that Earth has been destroyed by aliens and what is left of humanity is scattered about the universe in drifter colonies. Guided by a magic ring left to him by his father, Cale (Mr. Damon), a teenage space explorer, searches for the Titan, a hidden spaceship with the key to humanity's future. The technology is innovative and there are some gorgeous special effects. But the screenplay and characters are too bland for the story to catch fire (Holden)</p>
        <p>''U-571,'' starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Jon Bon Jovi, David Keith and Harvey Keitel. Directed by Jonathan Mostow (PG-13, 120 minutes). Mr. Mostow, whose previous film, ''Breakdown,'' was a marvel of B-picture minimalism, shifts from the wide-open spaces to the cramped interior of a World War II submarine movie. Mr. McConaughey, whose knotted-with-unease face makes it look as if he were cramming for finals, is part of a secret mission to capture a Nazi code-encryption machine and get it back to the Allies. He and his crew have to do so on a Nazi U-boat they have hijacked. Mr. Mostow does a fine job of building tension, given that he is working in a minor genre whose climactic notes you will know if you have ever seen a movie set on a sub (Mitchell).</p>
