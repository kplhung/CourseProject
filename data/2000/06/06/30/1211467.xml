        <p>BEARBAITING having been abolished and pigsticking being currently out of fashion, the public still needs spectacles, preferably vulgar and ominous.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the spectacle comes in the form of a troubled boxer named Mike Tyson threatening to eat other people's children and sometimes it comes in the tattooed form of Dennis Rodman, saying anything and wearing anything to get attention.</p>
        <p>Last night the spectacle was the return of John Rocker to Shea Stadium for the first time since he made his crude comments about the citizens of New York and particularly the diverse riders of the No. 7 elevated train that runs from Manhattan to the borough of Queens in all its zestful ethnic glory. He pitched a scoreless eighth inning as the Braves beat the Mets once again, 6-4.</p>
        <p>Rocker's remarks escalated like some new strain of virus let loose outside the laboratory of his own mind. But then again, the news media gave Rocker's remarks the ultimate breeding dish, and the populace provided the heat.</p>
        <p>There was a lot of blame to go around for the foolish tableau that had Rocker make a feint toward taking the IRT to the ballpark until wiser heads prevailed. There was more blame for the dolts who sent notices of Battery Night for this first visit by the Atlanta Braves.</p>
        <p>Casey Stengel used to say that every day in baseball you see something you never saw before (a pretty strong statement for a man who managed until he was 75), but it is quite possible nobody had ever seen a player's mixture of mea culpa and nolo contendere beamed from a message board.</p>
        <p>The Romans, who put men in the ring with bulls, or any other combination with potential for gore and titillation, would have been perplexed by the sight of Rocker, looming larger than life high above the stands, reading a quirky prepared statement he claimed to have written, and probably did.</p>
        <p>Rocker said he was ''happy to be back in New York, believe it or not,'' and he referred with proper irony to ''my presumed hatred for the people of New York'' and he said he was sorry for the disruption to all, and he noted that he had apologized several times already, but he added, ''Many people perceived these comments to be malicious, and for this again I apologize.'' He concluded by saying, ''I am not the evil person that has been portrayed.''</p>
        <p>The early arrivals razzed Rocker, but almost reflexively, which may be a good sign that the fans are not up to perpetual menace.</p>
        <p>Since Sports Illustrated enterprisingly sent a reporter to see what manner of chap had come up with a huge case of rabbit ears during the playoffs, Rocker has been pursued by the furies, including the occasional scolding from his absolutely perfect little corner of the world.</p>
        <p>Rocker's ugly remarks about gays, people on welfare, people who speak foreign languages and others different from him -- and the righteousness and the outrage -- have a cost. Seven hundred police officers who could have been out righting wrongs (or giving tickets for parking at broken meters) were deployed yesterday, including phalanxes at Shea.</p>
        <p>Rocker is coming! Rocker is coming!</p>
        <p>Rocker is no fool. Some people think this was his Rodmanesque way of creating a second career as a professional wrestler, which seems unlikely, but he may surely have been messing with New York's mind by threatening to ride the No. 7 train, which his team and baseball were not about to permit. To this particular ploy, Rocker is entitled to say, ''Gotcha.''</p>
        <p>However, he is guilty of starting this madness, by shooting off his mouth with vile comments that didn't come from nowhere. Has he learned a lesson? The process seems to have wiped the smirk off Rocker's mouth, finally.</p>
        <p>Last night police officers were crouching in the front row, there was a temporary roof and partition around the Braves' bullpen, and the announced crowd of 46,998 waited to boo Rocker. The joint wasn't exactly bristling with the malice that seethes during the postseason.</p>
        <p>There was room for a few sportsmanlike cheers for the recovering cancer patient, Andres Galarraga, but the crowd seemed drained by the eighth inning, until Rocker made his trademark sprint to the mound. The crowd chanted a few nasty names, but he got three straight outs and then walked tall to the dugout as a few officers stood guard. Afterward, he said, ''I'm going to quit while I'm ahead and not talk,'' and he did not, while a security guard shooed reporters away.</p>
        <p>The potential for trouble will stay around all weekend, but maybe outright brutality has been averted at the cost of massive police overtime. There's got to be a better way to react to a few dumb remarks.</p>
