        <p>LENNOX LEWIS and his trainer, Emanuel Steward, had watched Mike Tyson level Lou Savarese in 38 seconds of the first round in Glasgow last Saturday night and now they were listening to Tyson's tasteless ringside message for the champion.</p>
        <p>''I want your heart,'' Tyson was snarling. ''I want to eat your children.''</p>
        <p>Here at Caesars Brookdale resort, where Lewis, the Englishman by way of Canada, is training for his July 15 heavyweight title defense against Francois Botha in London, Steward had a question.</p>
        <p>''Do you have any children, Lennox?'' he said.</p>
        <p>''No,'' replied Lewis, still a bachelor at 35.</p>
        <p>And yesterday Lewis had a message for Tyson.</p>
        <p>''Hearing what Tyson said kind of confused me because I thought he was a vegetarian being a Muslim and all,'' Lewis said with a slight smile as he sat on the edge of the ring after a workout. Then he stopped smiling. ''But before he gets to eat me, he's got to eat my left and my right first. And he knows what he can have for dessert.''</p>
        <p>If Tyson was hoping to goad Lewis into taking the bait for what might be a $50 million worldwide morality play, he succeeded.</p>
        <p>In the past, Lewis always spoke vaguely, but never urgently, about fighting Tyson someday. But yesterday, in commenting about Tyson's harangue, the champion all but ignored Botha as well as David Tua, his next scheduled opponent in a mandatory defense.</p>
        <p>''I'd love Tyson to be my next fight,'' Lewis said. ''I'm definitely going to be the guy to put him to sleep, to put him out of the game. That's very important to me. In one sense, I've been ordained to do that. In another sense, he's going to put himself away.''</p>
        <p>So the campaign for a Lewis-Tyson showdown has begun. During the current heavyweight famine, it's the only huge payday out there -- the squeaky clean champion against the street thug.</p>
        <p>Despite the supposed schism between the cable television promoters (HBO for Lewis, Showtime for Tyson), all the money out there will create a contract, as it always has in boxing.</p>
        <p>But for all his bombast, Tyson surprisingly, if not subconciously, acknowledged that he is not ready to fight Lewis: his next sideshow foe is expected to be Andrew Golota.</p>
        <p>''Speaking that way and then saying he's not ready, that doesn't exactly make Mike the baddest man on the planet,'' Steward said. ''I think Mike is either going to have to fight Lennox or shut up. I think Lennox is the only person Mike is afraid of. I think Lennox is a big thorn in his side, but I don't think it will ever happen.''</p>
        <p>If it does happen, Steward would have two concerns.</p>
        <p>''One, a strong referee; the referee in Glasgow wasn't stern enough,'' the trainer said. ''Two, if Tyson has to be disqualified, his purse should be held up and his license should be revoked for the rest of his life.''</p>
        <p>For promotional purposes, Tyson's ugly image would contrast with Lewis's polished and proper reputation, which now will be marketed by Leigh Steinberg, the agent known mostly for his stable of pro quarterbacks.</p>
        <p>''Being a nice guy comes naturally to me,'' Lewis said. ''I've never been that kind of person, doing those mad things and making those mad statements.</p>
        <p>''I think Tyson's one brick shy of a load, a train wreck waiting to happen.''</p>
        <p>Lewis might be training for Botha, the chunky South African who dominated the first four rounds against Tyson before being decked on a one-punch knockout, but the champion is dreaming about Tyson. Literally.</p>
        <p>''The other night I dreamed we were fighting and Mills Lane was the referee,'' the champion said, referring to the Las Vegas referee who disqualified Tyson for twice biting Evander Holyfield's right ear in 1997.</p>
        <p>How did the fight come out?</p>
        <p>''Obviously a disqualification,'' Lewis said.</p>
        <p>Why was Tyson disqualified?</p>
        <p>''He just didn't listen.''</p>
        <p>What was Mills saying to him?</p>
        <p>''I didn't get that deep into the dream,'' Lewis said with a smile, ''but Tyson was definitely jumping around.''</p>
        <p>As Tyson did in Glasgow, shoving the referee to the canvas before popping off.</p>
        <p>''Real tough guys don't talk tough,'' Emanuel Steward was saying now. ''But if they ever do fight, I think Lennox would take Tyson's heart in the first round and Tyson would start complaining and crying.''</p>
        <p>The campaign has begun.</p>
