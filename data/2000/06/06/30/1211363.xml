        <p>With a swaggering contempt for his accusers, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared today before a parliamentary committee investigating financial misdeeds under his rule and said he was a victim of slander.</p>
        <p>In hours of rambling testimony and subsequent exchanges with journalists, Mr. Kohl, who was chancellor from 1982 to 1998, said the parliamentary investigation amounted to ''an attempt to drag 16 good years through the mud'' and an ''act of unprecedented defamation.''</p>
        <p>His stance was consistent with the defiance he has shown since he admitted in December that he had taken about $1 million in undeclared, and thus illicit, payments from donors and used it to bolster his Christian Democratic Party in formerly Communist eastern Germany.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohl, who took the money between 1993 and 1998, has refused to identify the donors, and today he said he had ''no intention of naming them.'' Just as he had given his word that Germany would give up the mark for the common euro currency, so he had promised that the donors would remain anonymous, he added.</p>
        <p>His attempt to draw that analogy was the latest of a series of odd declarations from Mr. Kohl. Last week, he compared the ostracism he believes he is suffering to that of the Jews under Hitler.</p>
        <p>Questioned about this much-criticized reference to persecution of Jews, Mr. Kohl, 70, shot back: ''I do not need any private tutoring on history. As far as the relationship with the Jews is concerned, I suggest you go to Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. There you will find out who among living German politicians is held in highest regard.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohl's international reputation remains high, a tribute above all to his deft handling of German unification in 1990. But the hubris he has shown as his party has reeled from a scandal involving the revelation that millions of dollars were paid in secret to the Christian Democrats has hurt his domestic standing.</p>
        <p>''This had been an unprecedented attempt to defame me through inaccurate reports, insinuations and twisting of the facts to criminalize me,'' Mr. Kohl told the parliamentary committee. He cited reports in the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung and ''on that e-mail thing -- whatever it's called -- I mean, the Internet.''</p>
        <p>Throughout the day, Mr. Kohl veered between anger and jocularity. When the proceedings began a little late, he shouted, ''Mr. Chairman, when may we commence this zoological event?''</p>
        <p>He testified the day after Burkhard Hirsch, a former vice president of Parliament, told the committee that in the days after Mr. Kohl's electoral defeat in September 1998, most of the files in the Chancellery were destroyed. ''This massive erasure of data had no legal basis,'' Mr. Hirsch said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohl dismissed as ''stupid'' anyone who could believe that millions of files had been destroyed, insisting that all the people around him were ''honorable'' and that there was no motive for such destruction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirsch said Wednesday that computer experts had managed to retrieve one file showing that letters ostensibly written by four state premiers calling on the government not to investigate privatizations in the former East Germany had in fact been prepared in the Chancellery.</p>
        <p>One of these privatizations, that of the Leuna oil refinery, has been the object of particular scrutiny because of the apparently inflated price paid for it by Elf Aquitaine of France and because of evidence that kickbacks were paid to several agents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohl said accusations that the sale was corrupt and that his party benefited from the kickbacks were ''a scandalous distortion of reality.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''It became clear that it was going to be hard to find an investor for Leuna. In the end, only Elf showed the necessary commitment. I spoke to President Mitterrand, and he agreed that the involvement of a large French company in Leuna would have great psychological significance in the former East Germany.''</p>
        <p>This statement appeared to be the first time that Mr. Kohl acknowledged speaking to Francois Mitterrand, who died in 1996, about the sale before it went through. The French president had been wary of German unification; the transaction became a symbol of restored political trust between Europe's central allies.</p>
        <p>As for another suspect sale -- that of 36 German tanks to Saudi Arabia in 1991 -- Mr. Kohl said it had been made with the express blessing of the American Secretary of State, James A. Baker III, after the United States criticized Germany for not sending troops to help the effort to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.</p>
        <p>''I have no knowledge of bribery in this deal,'' Mr. Kohl said. ''It did not happen. I have never been corrupt.''</p>
        <p>The former second-ranking military official in his government, Ludwig-Holger Pfahls, has disappeared after being accused of receiving $2 million in a Swiss bank account for his role in facilitating the sale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohl, who has raised over $3 million to pay back a fine imposed on the party for its actions under his rule, said more than once that he had ''made mistakes.'' But he also said more than once that he was not and had never been ''for sale.''</p>
        <p>The parliamentary investigation is expected to end this year. It will make recommendations on campaign financing and give a detailed account of Mr. Kohl's actions. But the former chancellor is very unlikely to face any formal sanction.</p>
