        <p>Alice Neel could be witheringly blunt. ''Art is not as stupid as human conversation,'' she was once quoted as saying. I wrote it down and pinned it up at my desk, struck by its weirdness. In its unequivocal dismissal of daily discourse, Neel's remark gives one a glimpse of a certain darkness: the misanthropy and self-protective brutality that, along with more positive instincts, may be part of the commitment to being an artist.</p>
        <p>Neel, who died in 1984 at the age of 84, acted on that commitment for nearly 60 years, making some of the 20th century's best paintings, especially portraits, as demonstrated by the illuminating but insufficient retrospective of her work that opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art. It has been organized by Ann Temkin, the curator of modern and contemporary art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and will make four more stops over the next 18 months.</p>
        <p>Make no mistake, Neel also knew how to use her mouth. She negotiated the bureaucracies of the W.P.A. and public assistance and was active in artists' political groups throughout her life. She gave pithy interviews as interest in her work grew.</p>
        <p>Neel was known for talking almost nonstop as she painted her subject, often detailing the amazing ups and downs of her colorful life, with its poverty, many love affairs, radical politics and children born out of wedlock. She lived her life exactly as she pleased and said so. A round-table discussion about the experience of sitting for Neel appears in the catalog, and the painter Benny Andrews recalls that she told him: ''I'm cursed to be in this Mother Hubbard body. I am a real sexy person.''</p>
        <p>You can almost hear Neel talking at the Whitney. Talking to her friends, lovers, children and grandchildren as she painted them. Talking strangers into sitting for her, like the lean, nattily dressed Fuller Brush man whom she painted in 1965, learning in the process that he was a Holocaust survivor. Talking people who had already agreed to pose into doing so nude.</p>
        <p>An innate egalitarian, Neel had to be voluble and gregarious to have painted so many people unlike herself. From her Greenwich Village bohemia phase of the 1930's, there is a demonic portrait of Joe Gould, the slightly crazed, Harvard-educated street person immortalized in Joseph Mitchell's famous New Yorker article, whom she depicted with three sets of genitals.</p>
        <p>From her days in Spanish Harlem, where she lived in the 1940's and 50's, first with a singer named Jose Santiago and then with the photographer and filmmaker Sam Brody, there is something of a rainbow coalition of faces: from 1959, twin black girls, no older than 4 or 5, stare up at the artist with quiet curiosity; from 1955, Georgie Arce, a friendly Hispanic youth, is seen against a lush pink background; from 1946, a dark-haired young woman in a red-striped blouse leans against a wall of arabesque-patterned wallpaper, looking like a Semitic princess.</p>
        <p>And from the 1960's and 70's, when Neel finally began to get the critical attention she deserved, there are portraits of art-world figures: the dealer Elinor Poindexter looking almost as loony as Joe Gould; a withdrawn Andy Warhol stripped to the waist, the awful scars of Valerie Solanas's assassination attempt mapping his sunken chest; and the art critics (and at the time lovers) Gregory Battcock and David Bourdon, their differences signaled by the first being in his underwear and the other in a suit and tie.</p>
        <p>It seems fitting that Neel's distinctive expressionistic realism, as some critics called it, can be described as extremely loquacious. In her mature work all the parts of each painting have their say: colors carry on one conversation, textures and brushwork another, her oddly distorted bodies, limbs and facial features a third. And the avid expressions on most of Neel's subjects, which contribute greatly to her work's intensity, show that they were listening to her, often riveted.</p>
        <p>If Neel's life was a big subject, her art is, too, and this exhibition indicates that without doing it justice. The timing could not have been better. Portraiture and figurative painting are abundant; the body continues to be a consuming subject; and art about identity, sexuality and orientation is increasingly nonverbal and representational.</p>
        <p>But the show feels cramped, too small. It is top-heavy with the portraits of her last 25 years, when she mostly painted members of the art world or her family. These include many strong pictures, one being the portrait of a young, nervous Robert Smithson surrounded by agitated brushwork from 1962, when Smithson was an unknown painter of Expressionistic, cartoony canvases, not yet a bad-boy earth artist.</p>
        <p>The show's smallness and imbalance short-change the first 35 years of Neel's career and also her work in landscape, genre and still life. A few exceptions include a wonderful early still life, ''Symbols'' from 1933, with its sweet yet subtly sexual arrangement of doll and apples, and a powerful later one, ''Thanksgiving'' from 1967. This work, in which Neel depicts the dead fowl of traditional still-life painting plucked and draining in a kitchen sink, is one of several instances in which she brings an art-historical subject down to earth with a specifically feminist thud.</p>
        <p>The exhibition perpetuates the picture of Neel as a late bloomer when in fact she was also precocious, creating original work true to herself and her time at nearly every stage of her career. In this regard, she is very much like Stuart Davis, six years her senior. Like Davis, Neel in her early work operates fruitfully in the gap between the pioneering American modernists of the Stieglitz circle and the Abstract Expressionists.</p>
        <p>While Davis translated Cubism into an American vernacular, Neel was drawn to the Expressionism of Munch and van Gogh. Her translation incorporated elements of the Ash Can School and American Scene painting and Social Realism. It also drew from the straightforward evocation of American faces in the photographs of Lewis W. Hine, Walker Evans and Helen Levitt (a point that Susan Rosenberg, the assistant curator in Philadelphia, develops in her catalog essay), the emotionally resonant simplifications of American folk art and at times the hallucinatory strangeness of Charles Burchfield. In the end, Neel, like Davis, benefited from the bolder tactics of Abstract Expressionism and Pop, making her work an indelible part of postwar American art.</p>
        <p>It's a great story, as is Neel's life, but it exceeds the limits of this often rewarding show. This failure is partly architectural, a reflection of the Whitney's constricting ''one floor one artist'' approach. Neel should not be a one-floor artist. Her six-decade career deserves to be examined chapter and verse, on paper and canvas, which would require at least one-and-a-half if not two of the Whitney's floors. It's all the more galling that downstairs from Neel, a dozen large recent works by Robert Rauschenberg loll about in oceans of space. Maybe this show will grow a bit as it proceeds on its tour. At present, it keeps Neel in her modest, somewhat marginalized place, a position that the Whitney was created to subvert.</p>
        <p>''Alice Neel'' is at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through Sept. 17. It will travel to the Addison Gallery of American Art in Andover, Mass. (Oct. 7-Dec. 31); the Philadelphia Museum of Art (Feb. 18-April 15); the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis (June 9-Sept.  2); and the Denver Art Museum (Oct. 6-Dec. 30).</p>
