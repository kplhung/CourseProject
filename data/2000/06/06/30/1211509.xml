        <p>One of the virtues of the small Dahesh Museum, young but with both feet planted in tradition, is its mounting of academic theme and individual shows involving minor yet sometimes significant artists that would be hard to come by elsewhere.

        <p>One of the virtues of the small Dahesh Museum, young but with both feet planted in tradition, is its mounting of academic theme and individual shows involving minor yet sometimes significant artists that would be hard to come by elsewhere. The museum has grown (if not physically, at least in aesthetic stature) since its rocky beginning in Manhattan five years ago, when its exhibition policy was based on the kitschy 19th-century academic paintings acquired by its founding father, a Lebanese philosophical writer and art collector (1909-1984) known by his adopted moniker, Dr. Dahesh, which means ''inspiring wonder'' in Arabic.</p>
        <p>But after the first three shows of its own collection, the museum decided to broaden its program. Under the direction of J. David Farmer, an art historian, it began to bring in shows and borrow works to complement its own. As its ambitions have developed, the Dahesh -- maybe the only museum in America with a wall-to-wall program of 19th-century traditional academic art (eschewing Impressionism as too avant-garde) -- has gained in credibility among its institutional colleagues.</p>
        <p>''Originally we really had to go out and find stuff, but now it's coming to us,'' said Mr. Farmer. What's more, for the first time in its short history, the museum earlier this year organized its own show, ''Overcoming All Obstacles: The Women of the Academie Julian,'' which celebrated the pioneering role of the Parisian art school in training women. Breaking attendance records at the Dahesh, the show was the first the museum was able to circulate.</p>
        <p>The Dahesh would like to spread its wings in the building at 2 Columbus Circle, erected by Huntington Hartford and most recently occupied by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs. It has put in a bid for the building. But meanwhile, it is carrying on in its cramped Midtown quarters.</p>
        <p>Its current show, ''In the Footsteps of Goethe: Paintings and Drawings from German Collections'' is the first exhibition to focus on 19th-century landscape painting in Italy by Germans affiliated with the influential Dusseldorf Academy of Art -- an important center for traditional academic art training -- during its golden age, 1829-1865.</p>
        <p>More than 50 plein-air sketches -- done on site and concentrating on Rome and its environs -- by teachers and students of the Academy are on view, ranging from ink-and-pencil drawings to finished oils. The show was organized last year by Dr. Martina Stitt, curator of the Kunsthalle in Hamburg, to celebrate the 250th birthday of the writer, art collector and polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832). The Dahesh is its only United States stop.</p>
        <p>The lure of Italy for young German artists was much enhanced by Goethe's widely read ''Italian Journey,'' an artistic-philosophical diary of his sojourn there in the 1780's, first published in full in 1829. German artists had worked in Italy before, most notably the Nazarenes, a group of early 19th-century painters in Rome keen on reviving the purity of Christian expression in early Renaissance art. The history of German painters in Rome usually ends with the departure of the Nazarenes in the early 1830's. But new research has tracked the German presence in Italy to the 1860's.</p>
        <p>Among the contributions of the first wave of Goethe-inspired followers to the development of European landscape was the proliferation of the plein-air sketch, done directly from nature. Such sketches were regarded only as notes for finished work, but they later came to be accepted as finished paintings in themselves by more progressive artists, notably the Impressionists.</p>
        <p>The charismatic Friedrich Wilhelm von Schadow (1788-1862), a history painter who was part of the Nazarene group, headed the Dusseldorf Academy. It drew not only European but American students, William Stanley Haseltine and Worthington Whittredge among them, during its peak years, from 1826 to 1859. Von Schadow revered Italy, made several lengthy visits to Rome and was joined there by his students.</p>
        <p>What these northern artists loved about Italy besides its centrality to classical civilization were the picturesque ruins; beautiful vistas in the campagnas around Rome, Naples and Sicily; the architecture of Roman houses and monuments, gardens, woods, walls, hill towns; and above all the profusion of light that bathed everything in a golden glow.</p>
        <p>Among the more talented and prolific of the Dusseldorf painters was Johann Wilhelm Schirmer (1807-1863), who in 1839 became professor of landscape painting at the Academy. He was known for his offbeat perspectives and ability to register rapid changes of light. The artist most represented in the show, his contributions range from the beautifully lighted oil sketch ''At Tivoli, View Below the Villa d'Este'' (1840), a peek through heavy foliage at a grand structure, to the highly finished ''Italian Forest Landscape'' (1842). Completed two years after his return from Italy, it is a big, romantic close-up view of a forest through which two travelers make their way toward an idyllic destination that dazzles with its light.</p>
        <p>Schirmer's landscape students in Dusseldorf included the Swiss symbolist Arnold Bocklin (1827-1901), who made Rome his base from 1850 to 1857. A low-key Bocklin view of the Roman Campagna from that time is included in the show, ''Pontine Marshes'' (1851), a clump of foliage on rocky ground backed by an idyllic cloudscape. One of the few paintings with figures is a large, too-bright oil by Caspar Scheuren (1810-1887), ''Monks at the Italian Sea'' (1846), depicting men of the cloth on a balcony, looking out over a campanile at a stretch of blue sea illuminated by a startling pinkish-orange light.</p>
        <p>The show abounds in pencil sketches, too. Although most are notes for landscape paintings or architectural studies, one charming, undated work by Carl Andreae (1823-1904) depicts five friends and colleagues at the German Archaeological Institute. A strongly rendered lineup of profiles, it gives a lively character reading for each face. A more exuberant sketch by a Nazarene, Peter Cornelius (1783-1867), ''Festival of German Artists in Rome'' (1835) gives the rowdy flavor of life among the Dusseldorfers when not at their easels.</p>
        <p>Fleshing out a little-known area of German art, ''In the Footsteps of Goethe'' is a worthwhile show. The Dahesh is beginning to prove that among its fast-stepping sister museums on the New York scene, there is a place for one devoted to the arriere-garde.</p>
        <p>''In the Footsteps of Goethe: Paintings and Drawings From German Collections'' is at the Dahesh Museum, 601 Fifth Avenue, at 48th Street, (212) 759-0606, until Aug. 19.</p>
