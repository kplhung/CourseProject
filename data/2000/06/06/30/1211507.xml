        <p>A LITTLE TOO CLOSE TO GOD</p>
        <p>The Thrills and Panic of a Life</p>
        <p>in Israel</p>
        <p>By David Horovitz</p>
        <p>312 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.</p>
        <p>Philip Roth's statement of some years ago -- that in the West everything goes and nothing matters, while in the East nothing goes and everything matters -- invites a variation when it comes to Israel. There, everything goes and everything matters, which is logical in an embattled democratic country chopped up among deeply antagonistic groups, from transvestite entertainers to ultra-Orthodox rabbis.</p>
        <p>''A Little Too Close to God,'' David Horovitz's cogent, impassioned and yet zestfully common-sensical report from the Israeli front, portrays a country not so much divided as multiplied against itself, where almost nothing seems too small to provoke a battle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Horovitz, the editor of the English-language Jerusalem Report, a sober, generally pro-peace-with-the-Palestinians newsmagazine, emigrated from England to Israel when he was 20, about 20 years ago. He is married with three young children, all of whom he knows will one day have to serve in the Israeli army, so he sees Israel from several perspectives: as a father and husband, as a journalist, as a Reform Jew in a country where Orthodoxy wields ever greater power, and, most important perhaps, as a moderate in a country in danger of being swamped by extremes.</p>
        <p>His various perspectives, and his writerly lucidity, make Mr. Horovitz's book one of the most informing about the state of the state of Israel we are likely to have. It also makes a powerful, convincing argument that Israel, having made semipeace with two of its neighbors and with the Palestine Liberation Organization, faces what might be its greatest danger. This is the rise of the sort of domestic fanaticism that led to the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the consequent loss of a common unifying purpose among an ever more fragmented population.</p>
        <p>There is no doubting Mr. Horovitz's love for his adopted country, the one place, he writes, where ''I care about what's happening with a passion that simply doesn't apply anywhere else.'' But he long since replaced the idea he brought with him from England -- that the Jews were good and the Arabs bad, that ''Jews couldn't possibly hate other Jews'' -- with a more sourly realistic assessment. Israel, in his portrait, is a place where a kind of pervasive rudeness makes everyday life unpleasant. It is also a country where 5-year-olds know about ''exploding buses and flag-draped coffins and ask, when it thunders, whether a war has started.''</p>
        <p>The polemical heart of ''A Little Too Close to God'' comes in Mr. Horovitz's analysis of the peace negotiations with the Palestinians and the divisions that the agreements with Yasser Arafat have provoked among the Jews. He is unequivocal in his support of the peace process, not because of a love for Mr. Arafat (whom he portrays as mysterious, mercurial, savvy and opportunistic) but because it represents the least risky and most hopeful path toward a normal future. Mr. Horovitz makes no secret of his contempt for former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose policies, in his view, might have maintained the letter of the peace process but were carried out so grudgingly and meanly as to have wrecked its spirit. He sees the current prime minister, Ehud Barak,  as Israel's last hope.</p>
        <p>For him, the cataclysmic Israeli tragedy, the annihilation of innocence, was the assassination of Rabin, an event that brought unmistakably to the fore the savage and irreconcilable nature of the intra-Israeli divisions. But he puts the assassination into a broader picture, one in which Israel's main strengths as a nation began slowly to be eroded, starting with the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and following with the Palestinian uprising known as the Intifada.</p>
        <p>''My worries are twofold,'' Mr. Horovitz writes: ''that the assumption of moral right, surely a key psychological factor in the successes between 1948 and 1973, has been blown away by the Lebanon war and the Intifada; and that the last of our military 'victories,' that turnaround from near defeat in the Yom Kippur War, . . . came a generation ago.''</p>
        <p>The myth of Israeli invincibility, Mr. Horovitz argues, is just that, a myth, and the country's vaunted intelligence services have bungled their job disastrously several times in recent years -- by, for example, failing to predict the Intifada. Under Mr. Netanyahu especially, in this view, Israel succeeded in brutalizing its opponents without increasing its security. Meanwhile, Mr. Horovitz cites evidence that a kind of religious right wing is emerging in Israel that, on moral grounds, increasingly resembles the country's traditional enemies.</p>
        <p>Before the Rabin assassination, Mr. Horovitz attended anti-Rabin rallies sponsored by Mr. Netanyahu's Likud Party that he describes this way: ''I felt as if I were among wild animals, vicious, angry predators craving flesh and scenting blood.  There was elation in the anger, elation bred of the certainty of eventual success.''</p>
        <p>One of the elements that makes Mr. Horovitz's book persuasive is the richness of its detail, detail observed in his role as an Israeli citizen, as when, for example, he served as a guard at a prison for Palestinians in Gaza during an army tour of duty.  Another element is Mr. Horovitz's open-mindedness toward opposing views, which he fully summarizes as he makes his own arguments. The anti-peace-movement position is represented by none other than Mr. Horovitz's brother-in-law, Natan, who is not an extremist but rather a West Bank settler convinced that the ultimate Palestinian objective remains Israel's destruction. In the end, the argument between the two men exemplifies Israel's growing division into two mentalities, two distinct Israels, with each side utterly convinced that the other is leading the country to perdition.</p>
        <p>Throughout, Mr. Horovitz writes elegantly, brightly and with a rather British self-deprecating sense of humor, which saves his book from heaviness even when he confronts the hardest questions. Many people will not like the views expressed here, and, indeed, Mr. Horovitz allows that a certain amount of invective has been hurled his way already, notably by American Jewish audiences he has spoken to on visits to the United States. But the worrisome portrait that he paints of his adopted country is too well balanced, too intelligent and too informed by love not to be given its due.</p>
