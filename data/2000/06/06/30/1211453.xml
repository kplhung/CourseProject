        <p>Though the pursuit of a slugging outfielder might have captivated those who follow trade speculation and might have hung over the Yankees for the last two weeks, it was the woeful state of the club's pitching that was at the root of the Yankees' unseemly six-week struggle since May 11, when they were 13 games over .500.</p>

        <p>Though the pursuit of a slugging outfielder might have captivated those who follow trade speculation and might have hung over the Yankees for the last two weeks, it was the woeful state of the club's pitching that was at the root of the Yankees' unseemly six-week struggle since May 11, when they were 13 games over .500.</p>
        <p>Before tonight's game against the Tigers at Comerica Park, in the wake of a trade that sent David Justice to the Yankees from Cleveland, the talk was not of how to shore up the Yankee offense but of just how dramatic the misery of the pitching staff had been.</p>
        <p>David Cone spoke confidently of the notion that all the staff needed was to get several quality starts in a row to stop its slide and re-establish the equilibrium of the rotation.</p>
        <p>Tonight Andy Pettitte, pitching on three days' rest because the scheduled starter, Ramiro Mendoza, was placed on the disabled list on Wednesday, stood firm.</p>
        <p>He said he relished the opportunity to bolster the staff with this start, but even he had not counted on such success. He was aiming for seven strong innings.</p>
        <p>Apparently emboldened by the Yankees' eight-run fourth inning, and pitching aggressively, Pettitte outdid his expectations in beating Detroit, 8-0, tonight. He allowed six hits in handing the Tigers (32-43) their 10th shutout loss of the season.</p>
        <p>One night after the Tigers pounded the rookie Ben Ford and the reliever Allen Watson in a 13-6 demolition of the Yankees, Detroit succumbed to the first complete game by a Yankee pitcher since the last time Pettitte (8-4) notched one, on May 29.</p>
        <p>''It was great to be able to give us a good start,'' said Pettitte, who has one other complete-game shutout in his career.</p>
        <p>''I said that all of our problems would go away with a good pitching performance. Trade or no trade, we win here because we pitch well. That's the way we've won for four years. Runs are nice, but good pitching shuts down good offense. I was determined to put together a good start. It was nice to get something going.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees (38-35) can exhale a bit with this victory. It was their first triumph in the Tigers' new stadium after five straight losses, and it kept them three games behind first-place Toronto in the American League East as they head to Florida for a three-game series against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</p>
        <p>Jason Grimsley is expected to start Friday night and the healing Orlando Hernandez and Roger Clemens should go on Saturday and on Sunday. But it was up to Pettitte tonight to put a halt to a stretch in which the rotation was being held together by bandages, fill-ins and awestruck rookies.</p>
        <p>Pettitte had been mediocre (1-2, 4.84 earned run average) in the six previous times he had pitched on short rest, and he had not done it since 1997. But the left-hander allowed just two hits through the first three innings before his teammates unleashed a furious assault.</p>
        <p>The Yankees sent 13 batters to the plate in the fourth inning. The rally began with Paul O'Neill's single off Dave Mlicki. There were eight hits in the inning, one a triple to the center-field wall by Bernie Williams on which center fielder Juan Encarnacion seemed to have no clue which way to break before watching the ball sail over his head.</p>
        <p>And there were three sacrifice flies in the inning, a feat that happened one other time, in 1962. It was possible because Jose Vizcaino's drive to left field with one out briefly nestled in Bobby Higginson's glove, only to drop out. Vizcaino went to first base on the error, Scott Brosius scored the fourth run of the inning, and the play was ruled a sacrifice fly.</p>
        <p>Four more runs followed, the last one on Williams's sacrifice fly off reliever Nelson Cruz.</p>
        <p>Such offensive theatrics, even with the acquisition of Justice, Manager Joe Torre said, would not have as much impact on the Yankees as the revival of the pitching staff.</p>
        <p>''David or Goliath couldn't help us if we don't pitch,'' Torre said. ''It tells us what we should know already -- all it takes is someone going on the mound and shutting them down. After that, we know how to play.''</p>
