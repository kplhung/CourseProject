        <p>Kenyon Martin, the No. 1 pick over all of the National Basketball Association draft, by the Nets, nervously shifted his 6-foot-9-inch, 235-pound frame back and forth from his recently broken right leg to his left leg.</p>
        <p>He spoke in a soft, raspy voice, as if he had momentarily swallowed his intimidating court persona, the one shown in his thundering dunks and blocks.</p>
        <p>''It's an honor to be here; I'm going to give my all,'' he said in the basement of the N.B.A. Store on Fifth Avenue, nodding to the assembled YankeeNets brass, members of the news media and 80 or so shoppers lining the spiral ramps.</p>
        <p>Martin squinted in the lights, his diamond stud earrings reflecting rainbows. ''I didn't expect this many people,'' he said with a thin smile.</p>
        <p>That Martin, the 22-year-old national player of the year from the University of Cincinnati, stood yesterday at the podium as the winner of the Nets' lottery involved some luck, but it was more a defining statement about his perseverance.</p>
        <p>Fifteen years ago, Martin would have been unable get a word out even to his classmates because he stuttered so badly. He cringed under merciless teasing, but he worked with a tutor and improved.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I still do,'' he said of the stuttering. ''I've come 360 degrees, though. If someone said I can't do something, I want to go out there and do it more. It's just hard work. I don't know any other way of doing things.''</p>
        <p>Last June, if Martin had come out a year early for the draft, scouts were projecting him to go in the middle of the first round. So he stayed in school to improve his offensive skills, sequestering himself in the gym.</p>
        <p>''He shot it and shot until his arm fell off,'' Cincinnati's assistant coach, Rod Baker, said.</p>
        <p>Last summer, Martin led the United States junior national team to a gold medal in the World University Games in Spain, scoring 21 points and pulling down 7 rebounds in the final game.</p>
        <p>Martin had progressed from a scrawny freshman who averaged 2.8 points to the best player in the country this March, averaging 18.9 points and 9.7 rebounds -- and aching to bring Cincinnati a national title. His dream was lost, though, when he broke his right fibula in the Conference USA tournament.</p>
        <p>Since that day, Martin has had surgery -- two pins placed in his ankle and two pins removed -- but has been unable to shake the rumors about the need for another surgery.</p>
        <p>''I'm fine,'' he said. ''The Nets' doctors do not want me to rush it. I'll be ready by training camp.''</p>
        <p>''The last three months have been unreal,'' Martin said, referring to his medical tour for teams. ''I have taken so many X-rays, turn these lights off and I might start glowing.''</p>
        <p>Two weeks after Martin had surgery in March, he left for Los Angeles, where his agent, Dan Fegan, set up his rehabilitation treatment at the Kerlan-Jobe Center.</p>
        <p>While in Los Angeles, Martin attended workouts with other prospective draftees, watching from the sideline on crutches.</p>
        <p>In the last few weeks, Martin was able to take part in light scrimmages, Fegan said, even working out with Kiki Vandeweghe, a former Knick. When Martin came to the Nets to interview a week and a half ago, he also had a light workout, displaying his lateral movement and range of motion for team doctors.</p>
        <p>Rod Thorn, the Nets' president, said: ''There was an M.R.I. done, X-rays done, and the doctors said as far as they were concerned, he should not have any more problems with his injury. So, I trust them.''</p>
        <p>Thorn and Fegan will start hammering out Martin's salary. Martin could make from about $9.5 million for three years to $11.4 million, with an option for the fourth and fifth years.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Byron Scott, the Nets' rookie head coach, was thrilled to have Martin as his first pick.</p>
        <p>''I expect you to get up and down, play two positions,'' Scott said he told an intense-looking Martin yesterday. ''I'm looking for you to be an intimidator on the defensive end. I want you to be what you were in college, block shots, rebound, run the floor.''</p>
