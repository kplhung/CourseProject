        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* KING SUNNY ADE AND HIS AFRICAN BEATS, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Everything is multilayered in King Sunny Ade's juju music. Meshed guitar riffs, horn lines and drums add up to a prismatic funk behind Mr. Ade's gently determined voice; even his lyrics are layered with comments from talking drums. His band is an orchestra, a party, a dance contest and one of the finest ensembles in any form of music. Sunday at 8 p.m.; tickets are $22 in advance, $25 Sunday (Jon Pareles).</p>

        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* KING SUNNY ADE AND HIS AFRICAN BEATS, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Everything is multilayered in King Sunny Ade's juju music.

        <p>* BILLY BRAGG, SHAWN COLVIN, the Lawn, Battery Park, State Street and Battery Place, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789. The personal and the political both matter to Billy Bragg, an English songwriter with a gruffly endearing voice and leftist ideals that don't preclude a sense of humor. He sings self-deprecating love songs and pro-labor arguments, and lately he has been writing melodies for rediscovered Woody Guthrie lyrics. Shawn Colvin has a sweetly compassionate voice, but her Grammy-winning song, ''Sunny Came Home,'' is about an abused wife who turns to arson. Tomorrow at 3:30 p.m.; admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* PETER BROTZMANN CHICAGO TENTET, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. In the last decade, Mr. Brotzmann, the German saxophonist, has become something of a father figure for American free-jazz musicians, especially in Chicago, where the jazz bohemians are studious and organized and win MacArthur grants. His Tentet, filled with the cream of the Chicago out-jazz scene, leans toward written arrangements -- a good thing for Mr. Brotzmann, whose bellowing tone could rip a hole in the wall and who has more musicality than he often lets on. The band opened for Sonic Youth two weeks ago; this is its first headlining club date in New York. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10; tickets are $15 (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>DOUGHTY, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. The acerbic former front man for Soul Coughing, one of the bands that best captured New York's 1990's vibe, shows what he's like as a solo artist. He's been working with the beatmaster known as BT and considering a collaboration with his fellow wiseacre John Flansburgh of They Might Be Giants, so tonight should offer some dancing grooves and some good laughs. The winsome pop poet Peter Salett shares the bill. Tonight at 9; tickets are $15 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>GEORGE COLEMAN QUARTET, Iridium, 48 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. A burly-sounding saxophonist whose live gigs tend to outclass his records, Mr. Coleman can be persuasive with both melody and harmony; he's from the same rich pool of talent in prewar Memphis that produced Booker Little, Harold Mabern and Frank Strozier. Sets are tonight through Sunday night at 8:30 and 10:30 and midnight tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25 tonight and tomorrow and $20 on Sunday; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>KENNY DREW JR. TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. Drew is one of the faster, more fluid pianists to emerge in jazz of the 1980's; he also has some classical training in his sound. Sets through Sunday are at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., with a 1 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow night; admission is $20 on weekends and $15 on Sunday; with a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* TOMMY FLANAGAN TRIO, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. A treasure in the history of mainstream postwar jazz, Mr. Flanagan, the pianist, and his trio have worked out a beautifully arranged music heavy with standards and Ellington. Here, with the new drummer Albert Heath now filling Lewis Nash's spot, is the proof that working bands can't be beat. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8 and 10:30 with a $25 cover; Sunday night sets are at 7 and 9, with a $18 cover; $10 minimum all nights (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* CHRIS LIGHTCAP QUARTET, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9318. A well-rounded young bassist, Mr. Lightcap leads a two-tenor band that gets ferocious in its free-jazz-with-motifs style; luckily, both tenor saxophonists, Tony Malaby and Bill McHenry, are excellent musicians with more to offer beyond pure energy. The band's first record, ''Lay-up'' (Fresh Sound), is one of the year's winners so far. Sets are tomorrow at 9 and 10:30 p.m.; admission is $10 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* MASTERS AT WORK/DANCEFUSION, Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 72d Street, (212) 360-2777. The producers and disc jockeys Little Louie Vega and David Morales have, over the last 10 years, come up with a body of dance-floor hits that bring out the Latin undercurrent in house music. Their self-described ''Latin soul'' reaches into gospel, jazz and rhythm-and-blues, proclaiming love and unity over the uplifting pulse of the 4/4 beat. They're recreating their lush productions with the singers and instrumentalists who made them -- including Jocelyn Brown, Jody Watley and the vibraphonist Roy Ayers -- backed by an orchestra including strings and horns. Dancefusion has choreographed the story of Masters at Work's most ambitious project, ''Nuyorican Soul.'' Mr. Vega plays one of his far-reaching disc-jockey sets at 1:30 p.m. Sunday, followed by the concert at 3. Admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>OGANS, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Ogans is a Bahia-style group of nearly a dozen drummers generating a parade beat that swings and struts. Their booming rhythm carries old and new hits that have Brazilians in the crowd singing along. Tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 1; admission is $20. (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* JEAN-MICHEL PILC TRIO, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. Mr. Pilc, a pianist, is a clever, high-energy musician, and his music is full of chord substitutions and moments of drilling intensity; he belongs in a line of splashy stunners stretching from Errol Garner to Don Pullen. The proof lies on a brand new disc, ''Live at Sweet Basil'' (A/ Challenge), and this week's engagement is a sort of homecoming. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $20 and $17.50 on weekends; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>PRAXIS, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Every so often Bill Laswell emerges from his mightily prolific studio schedule -- mixing and layering all kinds of jazz, world and electronic music -- to strap on his bass and start riffing. This time around, his band Praxis includes Brain, the drummer from Primus; DJ Disk, a turntable virtuoso from Invisibl Skratch Picklz; and the speed-demon guitarist Buckethead, whose identity is concealed behind a fried-chicken bucket. Tonight at 9 and 11; tickets are $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MARC RIBOT, ROY NATHANSON, CURTIS FOWLKES, REUBEN WILSON, J. T. LEWIS, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. This ad-hoc band should go off without a hitch. Mr. Nathanson and Mr. Fowlkes, the saxophonist and trombonist from the Jazz Passengers, are perfectly compatible with the easygoing soul-jazz style, the organist Reuben Wilson's stock in trade; his old tenor-and-organ records on Blue Note have been enjoying a bit of a rediscovery lately. And the guitarist Marc Ribot can and does play almost every style of western music. Sets tomorrow night at 9 and 11; tickets are $14 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>MAX ROACH QUARTET, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. One of the most important musicians in postwar jazz, Mr. Roach has a reputation that rests on his having co-invented bebop drumming as well as a fascinating range of projects thereafter, including brass bands, gospel, protest songs, duets with Cecil Taylor and Anthony Braxton, and the beloved music he made with Clifford Brown. Many of his recent performances have climaxed in his drum solos, which are so worked out in his head that they have a beautiful, carpentered simplicity: they start with bare-bones cross rhythms, build up, then break down again. Sets are tonight through Sunday night at 9 and 11:30; cover charge is $37.50; $5 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* GILBERTO SANTA ROSA, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-2672. Gilberto Santa Rosa has Latin pop hits, but onstage he holds on to the tradition of the sonero, the singer who pushes both the band and the dancers as he improvises both words and music. Tonight, with Ravel opening, admission is $10 before 9 p.m., $30 after; tomorrow, with Son by Four opening, admission is $20 before 11 p.m., $30 after (Pareles).</p>
        <p>SASHA AND JOHN DIGWEED, Twilo, 530 West 27th Street, (212) 268-1600. A longing for rapture and transcendence is never far from the surface of dance music, particularly in the utopian pulsations set out by the English disc-jockey partnership of John Digweed and Sasha. In their marathon sets of trance music, steady repetition holds time at bay and floating, whooshing sounds and voices suggest freedom from the rigors of form. Tonight; doors open at 11, with Jimmy Van M warming up and John Digweed and Sasha continuing well past dawn. Admission is $35 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>BRITNEY SPEARS, Jones Beach, Meadowbrook Parkway South, Wantagh, Long Island, (516) 221-1000. Many cliches spring to mind when considering Britney Spears: the girl can't help it, she works hard for the money, and girls just want to have fun. The stern yet bouncy ex-Mouseketeer is a human kaleidoscope containing every fantasy, positive and negative, that teenage girls conjure. Sometimes it's pretty, sometimes crass, but this shtick is always profitable. Don't worry about whether she can sing. Don't be surprised if there's no there there. Just enjoy the costume and mood changes as they swirl by. Tonight at 7:30; the $44.50 tickets are sold out but standing room is available for $29.50 (Powers).</p>
        <p>THE TRAGICALLY HIP, JEFF HEALEY BAND, GREAT BIG SEA, Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 72d Street, (212) 360-2777. New York's relatively invisible Canadian contingent always turns out in force for the Tragically Hip, a band that's hugely popular up north. Long before the Dave Matthews Band or the Wallflowers, the Tragically Hip was matching disillusioned lyrics to 1960's-flavored folk-rock, turning riff songs into chipper extended jams that throw off their frustration in brash guitar workouts. Jeff Healey leads one of Canada's better blues bands with his slide guitar. Great Big Sea, from Newfoundland, brings out the island's connection to the Celtic diaspora, fiddling and harmonizing in robust songs that are kin to sea chanteys, jigs and reels. Tomorrow at 3 p.m.; admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>JIMMY WEBB, JANIS IAN, JULES SHEAR, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. Anyone interested in the art of songwriting would clamor for a seat within earshot of this round table. Three of the best reflect on their stellar histories, which encompass the best of 1960's folk-pop, proto-feminist confession and New Wave craftiness. And you can never hear Jimmy Webb do ''Galveston'' too many times. Tonight at 7:30 and 10:30; admission is $20 (Powers).</p>
