        <p>This weekend on the History Channel, Senator John McCain discusses his imprisonment in a North Vietnamese prison. ''I was not a hero,'' says Senator McCain, heroically, ''I was witness to a hundred, thousands of acts of courage, compassion and love by men who remain my heroes to this day.''</p>
        <p>Senator McCain's recollections appear in ''Prisoners of War: Code of Conduct,'' part of a ''Sworn to Secrecy Marathon'' featuring prisoners and clandestine warfare, the History Channel's 12-hour alternative to the holiday barbecue.</p>
        <p>In fact, in observance of the long weekend, the network will be providing four such morning-to-evening marathons, from tomorrow through July 4. There will be lots of Nazis marching, as is usual on this network, and tales of the American Revolution, but also programs about cannibalism, King Tut and Dracula. Clearly, History Channel programming executives aren't slaves to thematic coherence.</p>
        <p>''Code of Conduct,'' a speedy survey of the treatment of prisoners of war from the Korean conflict through the Persian Gulf war, celebrates American heroism. It also helps explain why Senator McCain, during his brief presidential campaign, appealed even to people who didn't share his political beliefs. He presents an image of authority but also humbleness.</p>
        <p>''The best thing for me was to choose an attitude of defiance and an attitude that they would be unable to break my spirit and my will,'' he says in the documentary.</p>
        <p>The program aims to honor Senator McCain and other American prisoners of war without delving into historical complexity or political nuance. Without being artful or even particularly insightful, ''Code of Conduct'' capitalizes on mesmerizing old film footage (a History Channel specialty) and compelling stories of capture and torture. Endurance is recognized as one kind of heroism, with the message subliminally reinforced by having a movie hero (Charlton Heston) narrate.</p>
        <p>A retired brigadier general, Kenneth North, also a prisoner of war in Vietnam, describes the introductory method of torture used by the North Vietnamese: pulling a prisoner's arms behind his back and tying them together at the elbows, then yanking them higher until bones were dislocated. ''Trying to get your attention,'' comments General North, wryly.</p>
        <p>It's attention-getting, and sad and terrible, to hear about such cruelty. So the program provides some balm by explaining the inventive ways the P.O.W.'s managed to communicate with one another (in solitary confinement) and with the outside world. One American captive, dragged in front of cameras for propaganda purposes, blinked a message in Morse code. United States intelligence officers implanted messages into letters from the prisoners' loved ones.</p>
        <p>Senator McCain tells of a prisoner who gathered bits of thread and sewed an American flag inside his shirt. Every night his fellow prisoners saluted his shirt and said the Pledge of Allegiance. When the Vietcong discovered the flag, they beat the prisoner badly and threw him back in the cell. Senator McCain remembers watching this man take his revenge by sewing another flag, almost immediately.</p>
        <p>These cinematic moments are placed in context, but only briefly. We see film of diplomats scurrying and hear about the two Geneva Conventions (1929 and 1949), in which the signing countries laid out the rules governing prisoners of war. The program mentions a crucial paradox: North Vietnam said it didn't have to comply with the rules because the United States government had failed to call the war a war. Therefore, the Vietnamese argued, the P.O.W.'s were pirates and criminals, not entitled even to the meager niceties provided by the Geneva Convention.</p>
        <p>But with dawn-to-dusk holiday programming ahead, there's no time to linger on complexities -- and there are many wars to relive, over and over again.</p>
