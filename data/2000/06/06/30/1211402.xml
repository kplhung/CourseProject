        <p>Editorial on Mexico's upcoming presidential election says country has made important strides toward cleaning up its elections but serious problems remain; says irregularities by ruling PRI party tarnish Francisco Labastida's campaign and will undermine his legitimacy if he wins</p>

        <p>Mexico's presidential election Sunday will determine the outcome of a very tight race between Francisco Labastida, of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and his center-right rival, Vicente Fox. The vote will also be a test of how far Mexico has progressed from the fraud-tainted elections of the recent past. The close contest makes it imperative that all aspects of the voting and ballot counting be scrupulously fair and transparent.</p>
        <p>The policy differences separating the two leading contenders are relatively minor, particularly on issues concerning the United States. Both Mr. Labastida and Mr. Fox are broadly pro-trade and pro-business and would work comfortably with Washington on border and drug issues. The third major candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, from the center-left, is given no realistic chance of winning.</p>

        <p>Mexico's presidential election Sunday will determine the outcome of a very tight race between Francisco Labastida, of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and his center-right rival, Vicente Fox. The vote will also be a test of how far Mexico has progressed from the fraud-tainted elections of the recent past. The close contest makes it imperative that all aspects of the voting and ballot counting be scrupulously fair and transparent.</p>
        <p>The policy differences separating the two leading contenders are relatively minor, particularly on issues concerning the United States. Both Mr. Labastida and Mr. Fox are broadly pro-trade and pro-business and would work comfortably with Washington on border and drug issues. The third major candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, from the center-left, is given no realistic chance of winning.</p>
        <p>A victory by Mr. Fox would dislodge the PRI from the presidency for the first time since the party was formed by the victorious generals of the Mexican Revolution 71 years ago. Such change is overdue and would be a healthy development for Mexican democracy. But a Labastida victory could also serve democracy if it is achieved fairly.</p>
        <p>Over the past dozen years Mexico has made important strides toward cleaning up its elections. A new, independent electoral institute has been created to oversee the campaigning and assure an honest count. Lists of eligible voters have been compiled and photo identification cards issued to all qualified voters. Opposition parties now have a better chance to get out their messages and more confidence that voter choices will be respected.</p>
        <p>But serious problems remain, including the PRI's unchecked ability to use government spending to support Mr. Labastida's candidacy and the pervasive pro-government bias of most local broadcast and print media. Some local PRI operatives have been posing as ''independent'' poll monitors or have intimidated voters with fears that they will lose jobs or benefits if they fail to vote for the PRI. Such behavior tarnishes Mr. Labastida's campaign and will undermine his legitimacy if he wins. He must make every effort to bring it to a halt.</p>
