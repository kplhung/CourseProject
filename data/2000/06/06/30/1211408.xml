        <p>Gary C. Wendt, the man who built GE Capital Services into a powerhouse, was named yesterday as chairman and chief executive of Conseco Inc., the beleaguered insurance and financial services company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wendt's appointment, which had been rumored for more than a week, was hailed by Wall Street analysts, who said that his experience and track record made him Conseco's best hope for a strong recovery.</p>
        <p>Shares of Conseco, which rose sharply on Monday, jumped 14 percent yesterday, or $1.125, to $9, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>The appointment of Mr. Wendt comes two months after Stephen C. Hilbert, who founded Conseco 21 years ago, resigned as chairman and chief executive, along with Rollin M. Dick, who quit as the company's longtime chief financial officer. Both said investors had lost confidence in their credibility.</p>
        <p>Conseco, based in Carmel, Ind., had grown profitable under Mr. Hilbert through a series of acquisitions. But the company has been struggling the last two years, partly because of its costly and seemingly ill-fated acquisition of Green Tree Financial, which finances purchases of mobile homes. Conseco is now trying to sell the unit, which has been renamed Conseco Finance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wendt succeeds David W. Harkins, a company director who served as acting chairman and chief executive after the departure of Mr. Hilbert.</p>
        <p>The 58-year-old Mr. Wendt is now charged with trying to find a way to sell Conseco Finance and restore confidence in a company whose stock has lost about 82 percent of its value in the last two years.</p>
        <p>In a conference call with reporters, Mr. Wendt said yesterday that it was too early to outline a strategy for the company or say exactly what course he would take as chief executive. But he said he had accepted the job because he was familiar with the financial services industry from his tenure at GE Capital and because he relished the opportunity to turn around Conseco's fortunes.</p>
        <p>''It appears there's a challenge here,'' he said. ''There are things that have to get done.''</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts said they were pleased with Mr. Wendt's selection. But they cautioned that Conseco faces grave difficulties. The company is trying to sell Conseco Finance at far less than it paid in 1998. It is also facing a liquidity problem because of heavy borrowing, with up to $1 billion in bank debt. And profits are declining.</p>
        <p>Several analysts said they expected the company to undertake a restructuring effort in the next year. And they say that just days after the First Union Corporation said it would close its Money Store operation, it is not clear whether Conseco can find a buyer for its finance unit.</p>
        <p>''They certainly have gone out and hired the best guy to try and turn around the business,'' said Colin Devine, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ''But investors need to temper that because considerable issues with the finances remain unchanged.''</p>
        <p>The company said earlier this year that the sale of its finance unit would take place by the third quarter, but when asked about this timetable yesterday Mr. Wendt said merely that he would explore all options.</p>
        <p>Cathy Seifert, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, said Mr. Wendt would have to reassure big investors who lost confidence in the last year of Mr. Hilbert's tenure, particularly after the company reported disappointing first-quarter earnings this year.</p>
        <p>''Conseco lost a tremendous amount of institutional support,'' she said. ''It's going to take a long time to build that back up.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Seifert also said the company would have to create a financial structure that will allow investors to assess the company's value.</p>
        <p>''Trying to model this company is next to impossible,'' she said, adding, ''For quite some time this has been a rudderless ship.''</p>
        <p>At GE Capital, which consists of about 29 businesses ranging from credit cards to truck leasing, Mr. Wendt was known as a skillful and visionary leader; over a dozen years, the unit's profits grew to $4 billion from $300 million. By the late 1990's, GE Capital was the most profitable division of General Electric, accounting for about 40 percent of the company's profits in 1997.</p>
        <p>He left in late 1998 in a management shake-up that some analysts attribute in part to strained relations with John F. Welch, the chief executive of General Electric.</p>
        <p>A year ago, Mr. Wendt and other former GE Capital executives created a buyout and private equity investment fund.</p>
        <p>Days after Mr. Hilbert resigned from Conseco, however, Mr. Wendt tried to get in touch with Conseco officials at about the same time the company was trying to reach him to inquire about his interest in running the insurance giant.</p>
        <p>''Our letters crossed in the mail,'' Mr. Wendt said yesterday. ''They were calling me at the same time we were calling them.''</p>
        <p>The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the negotiations had been ''stymied'' because of a noncompete agreement Mr. Wendt had signed with General Electric.</p>
        <p>Gary Sheffer, a spokesman at General Electric, said yesterday that Mr. Wendt and the company had resolved the issue of Mr. Wendt's taking the Conseco post.</p>
        <p>''There was a negotiation to let Mr. Wendt out of his noncompete agreement,'' Mr. Sheffer said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sheffer would not elaborate on what the resolution was or comment on reports that as part of the settlement General Electric would have options to take a stake in Conseco.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Wendt said he would not comment on any talks he had with General Electric. He also declined to discuss his compensation package at Conseco, saying that it would be disclosed in public filings.</p>
        <p>Irwin L. Jacobs, the corporate financier who has been buying shares of Conseco and hinting at a takeover of the company, said he was overjoyed with Mr. Wendt's appointment.</p>
        <p>After acquiring nearly $50 million worth of stock in Conseco, most of it in the last few months, Mr. Jacobs said in an interview yesterday that he would remain a ''passive investor'' for now.</p>
        <p>''We know God can't come down here and do this,'' Mr. Jacobs said from his office in Minneapolis. ''But the next best thing to God is Gary Wendt.''</p>
