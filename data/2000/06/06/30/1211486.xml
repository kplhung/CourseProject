        <p>At the Grolier Club, an organization dedicated to book collecting, it is proper to judge a book by its cover. It is particularly so with the club's riveting exhibition ''The Art of Publishers' Bookbindings: 1815-1915.'' Displaying more than 250 books from the collection of Ellen K. Morris and Edward S. Levin, the show offers a fascinating window into the history of book production and cover design.</p>
        <p>The time span is significant. Before 1820, books were published without covers; customers took their purchases to bookbinders to have them put in leather covers. After 1820, in part because of the rise in literacy, publishers produced books with permanent covers.</p>

        <p>Bookbindings: 1815-1915'</p>
        <p>Grolier Club</p>

        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>Through July 29</p>
        <p>At the Grolier Club, an organization dedicated to book collecting, it is proper to judge a book by its cover. It is particularly so with the club's riveting exhibition ''The Art of Publishers' Bookbindings: 1815-1915.'' Displaying more than 250 books from the collection of Ellen K. Morris and Edward S. Levin, the show offers a fascinating window into the history of book production and cover design.</p>
        <p>The time span is significant. Before 1820, books were published without covers; customers took their purchases to bookbinders to have them put in leather covers. After 1820, in part because of the rise in literacy, publishers produced books with permanent covers.</p>
        <p>And so began a century of evolution in book cover design, from simple cloth bindings to leather covers embossed and gilded into extraordinarily complex abstract or pictorial compositions. Around the start of World War I, the cheap paper dust jacket arrived and the era of the intensively decorated cloth or leather binding ended.</p>
        <p>Many volumes on view here are interesting mainly for historic reasons. A book published by John Murray in London in 1834, for example, showing a wanderer blowing bubbles from a bubble pipe, is said to be the earliest cloth binding with a whole-cover pictorial image.</p>
        <p>Sections of the exhibition display common or not-so-common techniques, or show general stylistic trends like Medievalist, Teutonic, Orientalist or Art Nouveau. Other sections reveal marketing practices, like the use of a single design for a whole series of books, as in J. Hetzel's vivid, gold leaf on red designs for volumes by Jules Verne.</p>
        <p>But the exhibition is also studded with visual gems: ''The Book of the Pearl'' (1908), in which the title is surrounded by a luxuriantly profuse, gilded vine and flower pattern, with mauve accents on jade green fabric; or ''Blue Jackets of '76'' (1888), which eliminates text to make way for the bold, full-cover image of a plunging frigate.</p>
        <p>Some designs are by well-known artists, including a haunting, gilded one centered on an image of scissors and a lock of hair by Aubrey Beardsley for Alexander Pope's ''Rape of the Lock'' and Josef Hoffmann's Modernist but lavish, all-gold grid pattern for Franz Grillparzer's ''Arme Spielmann.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most spectacular volume is the art book ''Histoire et Monuments des Emaux Byzantins'' published in Germany in 1892. The opulent refinement of this massive tome's gold-and-black decoration on white Moroccan leather (as well as its silk brocade dust jacket and chromolithographic plates inside) so impressed contemporary connoisseurs that a company in St. Petersburg saw fit to produce another extravagant volume, ''Histoire du Livre,'' to document its creation.</p>
        <p>Today, on the eve of the electronic book, such sumptuous materialism seems almost surreal.</p>
