        <p>Over 40 years, Olympic broadcasts have developed into highly rated soap operas building to nightly crescendos by focusing on a few sports to the exclusion of many.</p>
        <p>Gymnastics is a biggie, for example, boxing an afterthought.</p>
        <p>Jim Lampley, who has helped describe nine Olympics, earlier this week called the prime-time Games a ''sort of bait-and-switch, hide-and-seek, piecemeal coverage.''</p>
        <p>Those tart bon mots came at an NBC news conference Wednesday to discuss a makeover of Olympic television.</p>
        <p>The overhaul does not change much at Mother NBC, which in Atlanta four years ago was the only way to watch the Olympics.</p>
        <p>But by adding MSNBC and CNBC on cable, NBC is providing avenues to show complete versions of sports ignored or shrunk into highlights in the past.</p>
        <p>Back to Lampley, who will host MSNBC's seven hours of daily coverage. He said that when he tells people  ''you're going to see an entire beach volleyball match, you're going to see the entire equestrian competition without interruption, in many cases people's jaws literally dropped.''</p>
        <p>Together, CNBC and MSNBC will be on the air 11 hours a day, catering to the fervent sports fan unsated by NBC's format. But you may need a vacation to capitalize on this bounty of long-form sports coverage. CNBC will be on from 5-9 p.m. weekdays and 4-9 p.m. on weekends; MSNBC will be on from 10 a.m. -5 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m.-4 p.m. on weekends (with daily replays at midnight).</p>
        <p>''In all, we are going to broadcast more than 20 different sports and more than 30 gold medal finals,'' said Molly Solomon, the coordinating producer of the cable coverage.</p>
        <p>The MSNBC-CNBC plan will please those outraged by NBC's minimal coverage of women's soccer and women's softball -- events won by United States teams four years ago but largely ignored by NBC.</p>
        <p>In Sydney, Australia, where the Olympics begin Sept. 16, MSNBC will carry every United States women's and men's soccer game, save the women's semifinal, which will be on NBC. MSNBC will also show every United States men's baseball and women's softball game.</p>
        <p>Cable will be the home to such long-ignored sports as beach volleyball, rowing, equestrian events, tennis and water polo. Boxing owns the 5-7 p.m. Eastern block on CNBC every day.</p>
        <p>But wait, there's more: 10 days of water polo, four archery finals and both field hockey finals!</p>
        <p>Solomon affirmed the cable philosophy: ''It's not highlights. It's not featurized segments.''</p>
        <p>NBC's mantra remains the same -- emotional storytelling. But its ability to pluck heartstrings from 7 p.m. to midnight for 17 nights will be tested more than ever because the 15-hour time difference from Sydney to the Eastern time zone will give fans a half day to study results before NBC airs the events on tape.</p>
        <p>NBC's Web site, www.nbcolympics.com, will carry instantaneous scores (and bios, analysis, diagrams and photographs) but no video, leaving each and every moving image of prime-time sports to NBC's discretionary use.</p>
        <p>But viewers must wait to see the chosen images of the prime-time sports. Nothing is being carried live. So, if the men's 100-meter dash final ends at 11 p.m. in Sydney, that's 8 a.m. the same day in New York. At the earliest, viewers must wait at least 11 hours to see it in prime time.</p>
        <p>Still, NBC is certain that results matter less than the tales, and prime-time viewers will continue to turn out. NBC's 84 1/2 prime-time hours ''are geared to putting the whole family in front of the television set,'' said Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports.</p>
        <p>A greater effort will be made to reduce the pro-United States slant of the past coverage. An estimated 48 percent of NBC's features will look at foreign athletes, 37 percent at Americans. NBC will also show more foreign anthems being played, rather than ducking out after Francis Scott Key's tune.</p>
        <p>But NBC's effort is still an American TV network's broadcast back to an American audience, so the jingo bells will still ring for Team U.S.A.</p>
        <p>''I'd be quick to point out that we're alone now amongst countries of the world that qualify athletes and teams in almost every single event of the Olympics,'' Ebersol said. ''If we don't show the Americans who are in all their events, I think that's a larger mistake for us to make, because we are the American broadcast network.''</p>
        <p>NBC's features will still emphasize the struggles endured by athletes to reach the Olympics. But, Ebersol said, the definition of a struggle has been narrowed. ''We've downgraded asthma as a major story of sacrifice,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ebersol described occasional debates over how emotional the storytelling should be, allowing that he is ''more Mantovani than Bob is.''</p>
        <p>Bob Costas, NBC's prime-time host, said: ''I agreed silently with some of the criticism of the excess in the past. But when there is a real story, real drama, that doesn't need violin strings, that doesn't need manipulation. There's some genuine emotion to it. That's what the best of Olympic broadcasting is about.''</p>
        <p>And on the first three nights, Costas will tell viewers that everything emanating from Sydney is on tape, an admission that the ''plausibly live'' ruse of 1992 and '96 -- in which events were taped but viewers were not told -- was unnecessary.</p>
        <p>''It was important for us to come 100 percent clean and say what we were going to do,'' Ebersol said.</p>
        <p>He added that ''plausibly live,'' which was intended only to explain that the taped coverage was to be shown as if it were happening live, ''really turned around and hurt us.''</p>
