        <p>Lock up your thoughts. Marc Salem is back in town.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salem is the mental magician who dazzled audiences at the Westside Theater in Midtown with his 1997 show, ''Mind Games.''</p>
        <p>Now, after a hiatus surrounding Independence Day, Mr. Salem, accompanied by a bass, piano, percussion trio, will be in residence at Feinstein's at the Regency from July 11 through Sept. 2 with ''Mind Games and All That Jazz.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Salem can still read and boggle minds. A scholar of nonverbal communication, he can confront five audience members with their drawings and, having instructed each to answer ''no'' when asked if he is the artist, proceed to identify liar after liar.</p>
        <p>He can ask audience members to think of a song from a list of songs and then identify the person who is thinking of a particular song, after having picked up interference from someone nearby who is thinking of another tune.</p>
        <p>He can call a woman in the audience by name and tell her that not only is she thinking of a stuffed baby polar bear but also about a trip to Edinburgh.</p>
        <p>And that's not all.</p>
        <p>So it is apparent that Mr. Salem, who disclaims the use of stooges or plants and maintains that everything he does can be done by ''any 10-year-old with 20 years of practice,'' has lost none of his skills, including a quick-witted talent for the ad lib.</p>
        <p>But handsome as it is, Feinstein's at the Regency may not be the ideal setting for the display of Mr. Salem's enjoyable bag of tricks. This Park Avenue nightclub, where Mr. Salem will perform at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday with 11 p.m. shows on Friday and Saturday, tends to draw a sophisticated if not jaded adult audience, and this is the sort of show that seems to work better in a theater and with a heterogenous audience. In particular, ''Mind Games''  could use a good jolt of the innocence, enthusiasm and wonder that children provide and that often communicates itself to their parents and the atmosphere in general.</p>
        <p>The intimacy of Feinstein's, where Mr. Salem seems to be working with a smaller palette than at the Westside Theater, detracts from the distance that enhances the aura of magic that can surround, say, a wristwatch that suddenly changes the time it displays.</p>
        <p>The jazz trio Vibrations, as pleasant and talented as it is, provides little more than a few attractive introductory numbers and a bit of musical commentary of the ''Twilight Zone'' sort on Mr. Salem's routines.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Salem and his wizardry provide cool fun for hot summer nights.</p>
        <p>MARC SALEM'S MIND GAMES AND ALL THAT JAZZ</p>
        <p>Written by Mr. Salem; lighting, sound and production stage management, Lennie Del Duca Jr. Produced by Allen Sviridoff. Presented by Feinstein's at the Regency. At 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street.</p>
        <p>WITH: Marc Salem.</p>
