        <p>IN addition to a rock single, ''Sparkling Blue,'' Jerry Hirshberg has had a number of design hits -- and some misses.</p>
        <p>1983 PULSAR NX -- You still see a few of these weird kitlike vehicles on the street. It came with two interchangeable rear roofs, allowing it to serve as coupe, sportback station wagon or convertible with truck bed.</p>

        <p>IN addition to a rock single, ''Sparkling Blue,'' Jerry Hirshberg has had a number of design hits -- and some misses.</p>
        <p>1983 PULSAR NX -- You still see a few of these weird kitlike vehicles on the street. It came with two interchangeable rear roofs, allowing it to serve as coupe, sportback station wagon or convertible with truck bed.</p>
        <p>1986 NISSAN PATHFINDER -- This two-door was among the first of a wave of sleeker, more carlike sport utilities.</p>
        <p>1990 GOBI PICKUP CONCEPT -- Its inspiration came one day when Mr. Hirshberg was stuck in traffic and two images ran through his mind: a grasshopper and a helicopter. The Gobi, which never reached production, promised a bubble cab and a short bed.</p>
        <p>1992 INFINITI J30 -- Developed to give the new division ''instant tradition,'' the ''retro Jag'' rear was polarizing and sales were modest; now Jaguar is doing its own retro Jags.</p>
        <p>1993 NISSAN ALTIMA -- The first generation of this midsize sedan was slightly shorter than an Accord or Camry, but had more interior space. The rounded shape especially appealed to women, but the Altima could not dislodge Honda and Toyota in the segment.</p>
        <p>1999 XTERRA -- This back-to-basics S.U.V. is wildly popular among young people.</p>
