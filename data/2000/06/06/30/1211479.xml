        <p>The Senate approved a bipartisan bill today that requires a growing number of secretive tax-exempt groups that raise and spend money on political activities to reveal their donors and expenditures.</p>
        <p>President Clinton said he would sign the measure into law, the first important change in the nation's campaign finance law in nearly a quarter-century. Only six Senate Republicans voted against the measure, which the House endorsed on Wednesday, 385 to 39.</p>

        <p>The Senate approved a bipartisan bill today that requires a growing number of secretive tax-exempt groups that raise and spend money on political activities to reveal their donors and expenditures.</p>
        <p>President Clinton said he would sign the measure into law, the first important change in the nation's campaign finance law in nearly a quarter-century. Only six Senate Republicans voted against the measure, which the House endorsed on Wednesday, 385 to 39.</p>
        <p>''Passage of this bill proves that public interest can triumph over special interests,'' Mr. Clinton said in a statement, urging lawmakers to keep pressing for a more comprehensive election law overhaul.</p>
        <p>Supporters hailed today's outcome as a major victory over Senate and House Republican leaders who had tried to block the measure, but they acknowledged that the new law might have only a limited impact on the remaining four months of this campaign cycle.</p>
        <p>''I'm not pretending we don't have other loopholes to close,'' said Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, ''but those groups that have found this an easy, painless way to go on the attack are now going to have to scramble to figure out different ways.''</p>
        <p>To avoid the new disclosure requirements, some of the groups formed under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code may reorganize either as for-profit organizations -- and lose their tax exemptions -- or as other types of nonprofits, tax lawyers said.</p>
        <p>Some donors may also rush big contributions to the groups, hoping to slip them in before the new law takes effect.</p>
        <p>Referring to Washington's center of high-powered lobbyists, Representative Michael N. Castle, a Delaware Republican who supports the bill, said, ''I am sure that the phones are ringing over on K Street right now about how to get money into the 527's before they are eliminated.''</p>
        <p>But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who heads the Senate Republican re-election campaign and voted no today, played down the measure's significance, calling it a ''relatively benign bill.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McConnell, an ardent opponent of the campaign finance overhaul who is not up for re-election this year, urged fellow Republicans who were facing re-election to vote yes ''to insulate them against absurd charges that they are in favor of secret campaign contributions or Chinese money or Mafia money.''  Mr. McConnel said he voted against the bill because it was an infringement on free speech.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas issued a statement applauding passage of the disclosure bill.</p>
        <p>''As I have previously stated,'' he said, ''I believe these third-party groups should have to disclose who is funding their ads. As the only candidate to fully disclose contributors on a daily basis, I have always been a strong believer in sunshine and full disclosure.''</p>
        <p>During the primary season, Sam Wyly, a longtime supporter of Mr. Bush, set up a Section 527 group called Republicans for Clean Air, which spent $2.5 million on issue advertisements criticizing the environmental record of Mr. Bush's leading opponent for the Republican nomination, Senator John McCain of Arizona.</p>
        <p>The final vote on the measure today was 92 to 6. The five other Republicans who voted no were Senators Paul Coverdell of Georgia, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, Connie Mack of Florida and Don Nickles of Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>Senator McCain, who championed the Senate bill, said that whatever fall-back positions the Section 527 groups took would offer fewer filing and reporting advantages than they have now.</p>
        <p>''This bill will not solve what is wrong with our campaign finance system,'' Mr. McCain said, promising to continue his fight to eliminate the unlimited donations called soft money. ''But it will give the public information regarding one especially pernicious weapon used in modern campaigns.''</p>
        <p>A broad spectrum of political players have created Section 527 committees, including liberal interest groups, wealthy individuals and a conservative group aligned with Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip.</p>
        <p>The organizations use donations for polling, advertising, telephone banks and direct-mail appeals, but are not subject to federal filing or reporting rules as long as they do not advocate the election or defeat of a specific candidate.</p>
        <p>The bill approved by Congress would require the Section 527 committees that raise more than $25,000 a year to comply with federal campaign law and file tax returns. They would have to disclose any contributors who gave more than $200 and report any expenditures of more than $500. These provisions would take effect as soon as the legislation is signed by President Clinton.</p>
        <p>The Section 527 groups would have to report their donors and spending to the Internal Revenue Service every three months during an election year. The information would then be made public and posted on the Internet.</p>
        <p>The campaign-disclosure measure would be the first alteration of campaign finance law since technical changes were made in 1979 to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974.</p>
        <p>Several groups operating under Section 527 said today that they would continue their fund-raising and political activities even as they reviewed their legal status.</p>
        <p>Karl Gallant, a DeLay ally who runs the Republican Majority Issues Committee, said he intended to ''continue on our core mission to give conservative voters a voice in the upcoming elections.''</p>
        <p>The committee, which acts as Mr. DeLay's political action committee,  expects to spend as much as $25 million in closely contested House races around the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gallant said he was uncertain about the practical impact on his group. He said the committee would comply with the law, but said, ''We are deeply concerned that Congress has placed the regulation of free speech in the hands of the tax collectors.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''We're not going anywhere. You will have R.M.I.C. to amuse and delight you throughout the election cycle.''</p>
        <p>Elsewhere on the political spectrum, the Sierra Club has conducted political activities through a 527 organization called the Environmental Voter Education Campaign since 1995. Dan Weiss, the Sierra Club's political director, said the group planned to spend about $8 million in this year's campaign on political advertising on environmental issues. He said the group supported both Republican and Democratic candidates.</p>
        <p>''We will eagerly comply with the new law as soon as it takes effect,'' Mr. Weiss said. ''But it's important to note that while we strongly support the passage of this reform, 527 money is just the tip of the soft-money iceberg. Real reform would mean banning all soft-money contributions to political parties.''</p>
        <p>One of the most lavishly financed Section 527 organizations is Citizens for Better Medicare, a group established a year ago by the pharmaceutical industry to lobby against a government-run prescription drug benefit under Medicare.</p>
        <p>The group has already spent more than $30 million on television, radio, print and Internet advertising and has been active in more than a dozen Congressional races.</p>
        <p>Dan Zielinski, a spokesman for Citizens for Better Medicare, said the group was reviewing its legal position in light of the disclosure measure but had not decided whether it would abandon its Section 527 status.</p>
        <p>''The coalition is not going away,'' Mr. Zielinski said. ''We will comply with whatever legal requirements are necessary. We'll do whatever the lawyers say we have to do.''</p>
        <p>At the other end of the financial scale from the drug industry is the Peace Voter Fund, a modestly financed remnant of the peace movement of the 1970's and 1980's. The fund, a Section 527 group, plans to engage in voter education and issue advocacy on disarmament in about a dozen Congressional districts this fall.</p>
        <p>Van Gosse, the group's executive director, said he would follow the dictates of the new law and continue the group's political activities as in the past.</p>
        <p>''Disclosure of donors is not a major issue for us,'' Mr. Gosse said. ''So we'll just say to donors in the future that they will be subject to federal disclosure requirements. It's no biggie.''</p>
