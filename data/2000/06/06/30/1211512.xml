        <p>Chicken Run  With the voices of Julia Sawalha, Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson, Benjamin Whitrow, Tony Haygarth, Phil Daniels  Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park  G  86 minutes</p>
        <p>Times are desperate for several dozen English hens at the Tweedy farm. ''We lay day in and day out, and when we don't lay enough, they kill us,'' one of them explains. Mr. Tweedy swings the hatchet but policy is set by his production-obsessed wife, who runs the barnyard like a concentration camp, with barbed wire along the fences and the number 17, as in Stalag 17, painted on one of the barrackslike hen houses.</p>
        <p>The sole holiday is a stretch of solitary confinement in a coal bin. If only the hens could escape. Led by the determined Ginger (Ms. Sawalha), they dig and drill with an eggbeater. That gets nowhere. ''We haven't tried not trying to escape; that might work,'' a hen suggests.</p>
        <p>Ginger dreams of an air route, whether by wing, slingshot or catapult. Then literally out of the blue comes Rocky, a flying rooster, or so it would appear. Rocky (Mr. Gibson) says he is a professionial. He is also an American, which draws some skepticism. ''Overpaid, oversexed and over here,'' one hen comments.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Ginger hails him as their one last hope and persuades him to teach the hens to fly. Calisthenics ensue, but early flight tests prove unpromising. Meanwhile, Mrs. Tweedy has hit on a better way to make money: grind up the birds for chicken pot pies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tweedy puts together a ghastly portable pot-pie maker. The hens' feed is increased, adding avoirdupois and taxing already questionable aerodynamics. Would this have stopped the Wright Brothers?</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE A hen's head is removed with a quiet chop, heard but not seen. The pie-making machine graphically dismembers and squashes all ingredients, and though no hens are caught in the thing, the process could be mildly unsettling to very small children. Otherwise the mishaps are plainly cartoon slapstick.</p>
        <p>SEX All the hens volunteer to share their nests with Rocky.</p>
        <p>PROFANITY None.</p>
        <p>FOOTNOTE In a process called Claymation, the figures are modeled of latex and not drawn. Generally this gives them more lifelike appearance and movement.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>AGES 3-6 Mr. Park, a British animator, is known for his Wallace and Gromit films, which are a good deal grittier than most animated movies. Here, any lasting harm is carefully avoided, but the mood is still a little darker than Disney.</p>
        <p>AGES 7 AND UP Fine.</p>
        <p>Me, Myself and Irene  Jim Carrey, Renee Zellweger, Anthony Anderson, Mongo Brownlee, Jerod Mixon, Michael Bowman, Robert Forster  Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly  R  100 minutes</p>
        <p>Behind those reflector sunglasses, Charlie Baileygates (Mr. Carrey), a  Rhode Island State Police motorcycle officer, looks like a speeder's worst nightmare. But on patrol and especially at home Charlie is milquetoast. ''I get the feeling the whole town is laughing at me,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Victim of a truly spectacular marital disaster, Charlie is the father of three African-American sons who were but babes in the backyard wading pool when their mother, a genius and Mensa chapter head, took off with their biological father. Left to raise the children, Charlie has three big, very bright and very obscene teenagers on his hands.</p>
        <p>A neighbor regularly lets his dog defecate on Charlie's lawn. On the beat a little girl screams him into submission. But then something snaps. Suddenly Charlie has another personality, named Hank. As aggressive as Charlie is passive, Hank picks fights with little children or anybody else. Hank himself, not his dog, defecates on his neighbor's lawn. And those sons had better get in line or Dad will have to ''bust a cap.''</p>
        <p>''Advanced hallucinatory schizophrenia,'' goes the diagnosis, enlivened by ''involuntarily narcissistic rage.'' It's all very confusing to Irene (Ms. Zellweger), the attractive golf course groundskeeper who has befriended Charlie and might take up with him romantically if the belligerent Hank didn't keep assaulting people.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE Some men are shot. So is a cow, which refuses to die and then is strangled by Charlie, who thinks he's doing the animal a good turn.</p>
        <p>SEX An oversized sex appliance plays a prominent role, as does a chicken.</p>
        <p>PROFANITY A deep supply of the strongest obscenities and expressions relating to the toilet.</p>
        <p>FOOTNOTE To attract the target audience (teenage and young adult, mostly male), the Farrelly brothers' movies (''There's Something About Mary'') make all possible use of sexual crudity and bodily fluids from wherever they may emanate. Deal with it -- or don't.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>UNDER AGE 12 Some will howl in protest, but no.</p>
        <p>AGES 12-14 Are they ready for the Farrellys?</p>
        <p>AGES 15 AND UP Don't be silly.</p>
        <p>Titan A.E.  With the voices of Matt Damon, Bill Pullman, John Leguizamo, Nathan Lane, Janeane Garofalo, Drew Barrymore  Directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman  PG  90 minutes</p>
        <p>In the 31st century our trusty little planet has been blown up by an electrostatic force called the Drej and the few survivors are hiding out on drifter colonies sailing around the universe.</p>
        <p>Out on Salvage Station Tau 14, the short-order cooks are roaches, and a rocket jockey named Korso (Mr. Pullman) is on the lookout for a 20-something slacker named Cale (Mr. Damon). Back when Earth was destroyed, Cale's father, a professor, gave the boy a ring that reveals the whereabouts of the Titan A.E. (after Earth), a giant space station that contains all the basics to help humans get going again on another planet.</p>
        <p>The Titan is a hot item. ''Position to destroy,'' wheezes a Drej, which talks like a disconnected air hose. Korso wants the Earth capsule to preserve the species, or so he says. Cale still resents his father for leaving him at the time of the attack (duty called) but overcomes some attitude problems to contribute plenty of ''Star Wars''-style heroics. A new planet is found. They call it Bob.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE Plenty of space pyrotechnics and annihilation, usually viewed at a distance.</p>
        <p>SEX Cale takes to a good-looking fellow drifter named Akima (Ms. Barrymore). No time at the moment, but maybe later.</p>
        <p>PROFANITY None.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>AGES 3-6 This is no simple, sunny animation for the littlest ones. The theme and characters are too intense and complicated, and some situations could be upsetting.</p>
        <p>AGES 7-10 Probably the best age for this film. The space-war razzle-dazzle will appeal, and youngsters won't be turned off by simplistic characters who for all the movie's visual accomplishments, act and talk as if they belong in Saturday morning cartoons.</p>
        <p>AGES 11 AND UP Generally too sophisticated (the viewers, that is).</p>
