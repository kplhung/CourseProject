        <p>Six years ago, when the conductor Vincent La Selva, the intrepid artistic director of the scrappy New York Grand Opera company, began his Viva, Verdi festival at SummerStage in Central Park, it was hard not to view the project as an act of ambitious insanity.

        <p>Six years ago, when the conductor Vincent La Selva, the intrepid artistic director of the scrappy New York Grand Opera company, began his Viva, Verdi festival at SummerStage in Central Park, it was hard not to view the project as an act of ambitious insanity. No other opera company in the world would think itself capable of amassing the artists and resources necessary to properly perform all 28 Verdi scores consecutively, from early oddities like ''Alzira'' to challenging masterworks like ''Otello.''</p>
        <p>But bringing opera to the people is Mr. La Selva's abiding artistic mission, and those who value his work have long been accustomed to the attendant compromises in his free outdoor productions: makeshift sets, stockroom costumes, rudimentary staging, an orchestra of solid professionals who must present often unfamiliar works under severely limited rehearsal schedules, and an amplification system more suited to rock concerts.</p>
        <p>Yet you have to give Mr. La Selva a great deal of credit for his tirelessness and vision. Whereas most free concerts pander to the general public, this Verdi cycle is challenging it. And by golly, Mr. La Selva has made good on his promise. The sixth of the projected seven summer seasons of Viva Verdi began on Wednesday night with ''Un Ballo in Maschera,'' which leaves five operas to go. As usual, several thousand enthusiastic listeners turned out for the performance.</p>
        <p>Their enthusiasm was tested. A sudden rain shower forced a 15-minute delay in Act I. Then, with just two scenes to go in Act III, rain came again, this time more heavily. During the delay a surprisingly large number of listeners stayed put, raising umbrellas over picnic dinners on the Astroturf and keeping seats dry in the bleachers. But the performance had to be stopped.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. La Selva is determined to complete the cycle as promised. At first it was announced that Act III would be performed on Monday night, the rain date. This plan has been canceled. Instead, Mr. La Selva will perform the last two scenes of ''Un Ballo'' before the complete performance of the next offering in the cycle, ''La Forza del Destino,'' on July 19 at 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>Whatever one may say about the homey productions he offers, Mr. La Selva is a strong musician and a true Verdi stylist. Amazingly, given the circumstances, he offered a shapely and arching if sometimes untidy performance of ''Un Ballo in Maschera,'' a story of perceived infidelity and assassination plots in colonial Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>Mr. La Selva's singers tend to be a mix of neophytes, like the earnest young baritone Raemond Martin  portraying Renato, the secretary to the governor of Boston, and veterans at the end of their careers, like the tenor Enrico Di Giuseppe, once a member of both the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Opera, who sang the lead role of Riccardo, the governor who has been carrying on an unconsummated romance with Renato's wife.</p>
        <p>Mr. Di Giuseppe brought an understanding of Italianate style and vocal presence to his singing, though his voice sounds worn these days. Of course, it is not really possible to assess operatic voices as processed by the SummerStage sound system. That said, the young soprano Katherine Harris, who sang Amelia, Renato's wife, seemed a promising new talent.</p>
        <p>The sets by Hal Tine were pretty humble: a pair of columns, some painted flats and assorted props. During one break between scenes it took four stagehands about seven minutes to affix a shaggy curtain to a set to evoke the hut of the ominous fortuneteller Ulrica, sung by the chesty-voiced mezzo Marisa Galvany. It hardly seemed worth the trouble.</p>
        <p>But ''grand opera'' is promised in the company's title, and Mr. La Selva is determined to give audiences at least a sense of the real thing. This is just one of the traits that has endeared him to grateful New Yorkers for 27 years.</p>
