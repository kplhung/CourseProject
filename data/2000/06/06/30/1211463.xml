        <p>Two men charged in the execution-style slayings of five workers at a Wendy's restaurant have been indicted by a grand jury on multiple counts of first- and second-degree murder, District Attorney Richard A. Brown of Queens announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said he had not decided whether to seek the death penalty for the men, John B. Taylor, 36, and Craig Godineaux, 30, and would need to do a ''thorough and painstaking'' review of the evidence.</p>
        <p>''I've got a great deal of work to do before reaching that decision,'' said Mr. Brown, who has 120 days from the arraignment, scheduled for July 27, to decide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor and Mr. Godineaux have been charged with 50 counts of first- and second-degree murder, attempted murder, robbery and weapons possessions in the May 24 killings at the restaurant, on Main Street in Flushing. The victims were bound and gagged, their heads covered with plastic bags, then were marched into a freezer room and shot one by one.</p>
        <p>Ramon Nazario, Anita C. Smith, Jean Dumel Auguste, Jeremy Mele and Ibadat Ali were killed. Two other workers -- Jaquione Johnson and  Patrick Castro -- were critically injured but have since been released from the hospital.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor also was charged with tampering with evidence. Mr. Brown said that Mr. Taylor took the keys to the restaurant and that he removed a videotape from a surveillance camera there.</p>
        <p>The men, who have been held without bail since their arrest in late May, have admitted to the murders in videotaped confessions, in which they outlined plans to rob the restaurant and kill the workers to eliminate witnesses, according to Gregory L. Lasak, the lead prosecutor in the case.</p>
        <p>The confessions also include details of how the slayings were carried out and how $2,400 in cash was stolen from the restaurant, Mr. Lasak said.</p>
        <p>In addition, one of the survivors of the shootings has identified the two suspects as the assailants, the authorities have said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor, who had worked at the Wendy's before being fired in October, tried to rob five fast-food restaurants last year, and had been a fugitive since November for jumping bail, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Godineaux, who had worked as a security guard in a clothing store,  served three prison terms in the last decade for robbery and drug offenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown has sought the death penalty in three cases since New York's death penalty law was reinstated in 1995, according to Mary de Bourbon, a spokeswoman for his office.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Mr. Brown sought the death penalty for James Allen Gordon, who was convicted of murdering three women and seriously injuring two others. Also that year, Mr. Brown sought the death penalty for George Davis Bell, who was convicted of murdering an off-duty police officer and the owner of a check cashing store.</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. Brown sought the death penalty for Steven Smelefsky, who pleaded guilty to killing two people in 1998.</p>
        <p>All three received life in prison without parole.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown, who has called the evidence against Mr. Taylor and Mr. Godineaux ''overwhelming,'' said he would need to look at their previous criminal records, their state of mind, backgrounds, motivation and other factors -- ''not simply the callousness and brutality of the crime'' -- before deciding whether to seek the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said he also had spoken to some family members of the victims about their wishes. His spokeswoman said later that the talks were not complete, and she would not say what the family members had expressed.</p>
