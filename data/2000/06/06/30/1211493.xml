        <p>Sean Kelly</p>

        <p>Reality is a fiction, or so a lot of contemporary photographers would have us believe. This well-put-together exhibition presents three who cannily play between the real and the fictitious.</p>
        <p>A single work by Joseph Cornell presides, alerting us to the world-in-a-box nature of pictures by James Casebere, Miriam Backstrom and Candida Hofer. Cornell's romanticism, however, is not reflected in these cerebral artists' implied deconstructive critiques of socially constructed realities.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Casebere's dreamy photographs, vacant, cavernous rooms, some flooded with water, are obviously roughly fabricated and strategically lighted models, but the images still convey a gloomy, oppressive feeling like that of an abandoned old prison or mental hospital.</p>
        <p>Ms. Backstrom, who lives in Sweden, shoots sets built for television shows or commercials. Images of a hospital hallway or a grungy bus station waiting room appear completely convincing until you notice the unfinished edges of the set: reality, that is, may be one thing when experienced inside certain boundaries and something else when seen from outside those boundaries.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hofer photographs real public spaces. In the context of this show, however, her images of library interiors look just as artificial as the spaces of Mr. Casebere and Ms. Backstrom, and are just as loaded with lessons about the institutional shaping of experience.</p>
