        <p>To the dismay of gay rights groups and some civil libertarians, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that it is unconstitutional for the state to require a Boy Scout troop to admit a gay scoutmaster. The court's decision, however, goes to the heart of the First Amendment's guarantee of free association. It may be a civil right to have access to employment, or to transportation, or to hotels and restaurants. But it is not a civil right to assist in raising other people's children.</p>
        <p>In the past, the court had understandably ruled that society's interest in ensuring access to certain opportunities like jobs, school and other basic necessities must sometimes override the right to associate with whomever one pleases. Everyone needs to make a living. Everyone needs an education. Thus, the court ruled that businesses or commercial gatherings like the Rotary Club cannot exclude women from their ranks.</p>

        <p>To the dismay of gay rights groups and some civil libertarians, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that it is unconstitutional for the state to require a Boy Scout troop to admit a gay scoutmaster. The court's decision, however, goes to the heart of the First Amendment's guarantee of free association. It may be a civil right to have access to employment, or to transportation, or to hotels and restaurants. But it is not a civil right to assist in raising other people's children.</p>
        <p>In the past, the court had understandably ruled that society's interest in ensuring access to certain opportunities like jobs, school and other basic necessities must sometimes override the right to associate with whomever one pleases. Everyone needs to make a living. Everyone needs an education. Thus, the court ruled that businesses or commercial gatherings like the Rotary Club cannot exclude women from their ranks.</p>
        <p>But serving as a role model for young children whose parents share common values is not the same sort of privilege as a job or an education. It is a service, and one entrusted to few people.</p>
        <p>To extend the reach of anti-discrimination laws to private groups whose purpose is not to make a profit, but to bring together people with similar values, would destroy the nation's diverse tradition of voluntary collaboration for common causes. And a world in which the government could declare which causes and which moral positions benefit society, and which do not, could only be described as Orwellian.</p>
        <p>The case arose when the Scouts informed James Dale that he could not serve as a leader of a troop in Monmouth County, N.J. Mr. Dale sued, claiming that the Scouts had unlawfully discriminated against him because he was gay, and the New Jersey courts agreed. But the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling, said that forcing a group to accept certain members may impair its ability to ''express those views, and only those views, that it intends to express.''</p>
        <p>Exercising the right to exclude others may seem intolerant, but such a right is indispensable to private groups seeking to define themselves, to chart their own moral course, and to work together for common ends. If the Boy Scouts were required to admit leaders who advocated a position contrary to its own, then men could assert the right to lead the Girl Scouts, gentiles could assert the right to head Jewish groups and heterosexuals could assert the right to lead gay groups.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dale's supporters said that the case was about status-based discrimination and that enforcing anti-discrimination laws against voluntary groups like the Scouts was valid because anti-gay beliefs are not what brought the Scouts together. But a group should not need to have an anti-gay agenda to hold the view that homosexual behavior is wrong. Many churches, for example, teach that homosexual activity is immoral while affirming that gay people should be treated with equal dignity and respect. That does not mean that they have given up their right not to appoint homosexuals to leadership.</p>
        <p>Like many Americans, the Boy Scouts attempt to walk the line between tolerance of everyone and disapproval of certain types of conduct. That they wish to express their view by example or by quiet persuasion, rather than an outspoken campaign, does not diminish their right to take a position on moral issues.</p>
        <p>As the court's majority understood, people's rights to hold moral positions, to associate with others who share the same views, and to instill those views in their children without threat of outside interference are liberties that belong as much to gay men and lesbians as to the Boy Scouts, as much to those who advocate alternative lifestyles as to those who advocate traditional morality.</p>
