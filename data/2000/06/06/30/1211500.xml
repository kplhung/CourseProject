        <p>Beyond providing an excuse to indulge in hot dogs and fireworks, the Fourth of July weekend can still call to mind the struggle around the event the holiday commemorates, the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

        <p>That would be the Bennington Battle Monument, a limestone shaft that does double duty, commemorating the Battle of Bennington in 1777 and providing a perch to which visitors can ascend for impressive views of the countryside.</p>

        <p>Beyond providing an excuse to indulge in hot dogs and fireworks, the Fourth of July weekend can still call to mind the struggle around the event the holiday commemorates, the signing of the Declaration of Independence. So perhaps a town like Bennington, whose ambience runs from the workaday to the artsy, should count itself fortunate to have so visible a reminder of Revolutionary valor.</p>
        <p>That would be the Bennington Battle Monument, a limestone shaft that does double duty, commemorating the Battle of Bennington in 1777 and providing a perch to which visitors can ascend for impressive views of the countryside.</p>
        <p>Reminders of revolutionary glory are only one diversion in southwestern Vermont, a place rich in recreational opportunities (the Appalachian Trail runs through the area) and in its association with famous people, from poets to the kin of presidents. Robert Frost is buried in Bennington. Mary Todd Lincoln spent summers in nearby Manchester, which is also the site of a mansion built by Robert Todd Lincoln, her son.</p>
        <p>I've felt the lure of the area since I lived in western Massachusetts, where I worked for a local newspaper in the early 1980's. Driving up to Bennington seemed like a pleasant escape.</p>
        <p>Now, as then, there are two ways to get around. Those who value speed can take Route 7, a highway connecting Bennington to Manchester, 20 miles north. But why go fast when there is so much to see?</p>
        <p>On a recent trip, my wife, Margaret, and I took the slow road, Route 7A, a two-laner that rises and dips across the rural landscape. We made our base in Arlington, a village that briefly served as Vermont's capital after the Revolution. Fortunately, the legislators have long since departed, leaving the place quiet.</p>
        <p>Because we liked the description in a guidebook, we booked a room at the Arlington Inn, a mid-19th-century Greek Revival mansion with a lawn fronting the main road. It turned out to be a very good choice; the friendly and responsive staff treated us and our toddler son with down-to-earth good cheer. From there we ambled around the countryside, admiring its many shades of green, and even found a couple of covered bridges, one not far from the inn.</p>
        <p>But we had some specific goals in mind, one being the Bennington Battlefield State Historic Site. Visiting it brings a surprise, as the site lies in New York, just across the Vermont line, on a small but steep hill. The British forces involved in the fighting had been heading for Bennington, on orders from Gen. John Burgoyne, to seize American supplies. Burgoyne's subordinate, Lt. Col. Friedrich Baum, made it only as far as a hill above the Walloomsac River, where he dug in.</p>
        <p>The high ground did him little good. His troops were overwhelmed on Aug. 16, 1777, by American forces under Gen. John Stark, a veteran of Bunker Hill. Baum died in the battle, as did 200 of his men. Vermont's militia, led by Seth Warner, saved the day by chasing off British reinforcements.</p>
        <p>Burgoyne, leading an army south from Canada in an effort to separate New England from the rest of the colonies, complained that Vermonters were ''the most rebellious race on the continent.'' He met his final defeat two months later, at Saratoga, N.Y.</p>
        <p>As for Warner, he is honored by a statue in front of the battle monument, built a century ago at the site of the supply house the British had hoped to take. A mile west of Bennington's downtown, in a community called Old Bennington, the 306-foot tower contains an upper floor that visitors can reach by elevator. Narrow windows offer views in all directions.</p>
        <p>Look south and you get a clear view of Mount Greylock, the highest point in Massachusetts. In the same direction, virtually in the tower's shadow, is the First Congregational Church, known locally as Old First. Completed in 1806, it is every inch the traditional white New England clapboard church-on-the-green.</p>
        <p>We first saw it illuminated by spotlights after nightfall -- a stunning sight -- as we drove into Bennington on Route 9 from Albany. The burial ground behind the church contains Robert Frost's grave, as well as the resting places of Revolutionary soldiers and several Vermont governors. The cemetery is one of several old graveyards in the vicinity bearing headstones with elaborate carvings of hourglasses and angels' heads and homespun couplets that were common in 18th-century New England. One such cemetery that is particularly worth seeing lies adjacent to Route 7A in the village of Shaftsbury. The Green Mountains form its backdrop.</p>
        <p>The culture in which these stones were created favored epitaphs that spoke of death with a bluntness now decidedly out of style. In Shaftsbury, this inscription is carved onto the stone of one Israel Cole, who died in 1787: ''You find the place where I am laid, To moulder in the dust. As you must be tis only said, That I am here the first.''</p>
        <p>From Shaftsbury it's a few miles to the busier streets of Manchester, a resort of long standing. In August 1863, Mrs. Lincoln brought her sons there to stay in the Equinox Hotel, which is still very much a part of the local scene.</p>
        <p>Land of a Lincoln</p>
        <p>Robert Todd Lincoln, her oldest (and the only of the Lincolns' children to reach adulthood) would later return to Manchester in a very big way. In 1902, a successful corporate lawyer, he bought 500 acres southeast of town and built a grand summer home, which he called Hildene. A Georgian Revival mansion, it sits atop high ground, with formal gardens and a generous view of the valley below.</p>
        <p>For the last two decades it has been owned and managed by the Friends of Hildene, a nonprofit preservationist group that bought it for $200,000 from the Christian Science Church, which had acquired it as a bequest from the last of the Lincoln descendants to live there, Mary (Peggy) Beckwith.</p>
        <p>These days it is open for tours from May to October, pretty much the time of year that Robert Lincoln's family was in residence.</p>
        <p>Our guide told us that Mary Beckwith, an animal lover who kept the mansion full of dogs and cats, was venturesome enough to learn to fly but so reticent in public that it took Pat Nixon (then wife of the vice president) several phone calls to persuade her to come to Virginia in 1960 to christen a Navy submarine named for Abraham Lincoln.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the mansion strongly reflects the presence of the younger Mr. Lincoln. Although he wore a beard in later life, he looked little like his presidential father, to judge by a portrait that hangs in the dining room.</p>
        <p>It could not have been easy being the son of the martyred savior of the Union. And there does not seem to be much in Robert Lincoln's public life to appeal to idealists. Twenty-two years old when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, he became a lawyer in Chicago, establishing a base of corporate clients that included the Pullman railroad car company; he became the company's president in 1897, only a few years after the concern had crushed its workers in the great Pullman strike.</p>
        <p>He never sought elective office but twice served in Republican administrations, as secretary of war and later as ambassador to Great Britain. In Manchester, he played golf daily.</p>
        <p>What a visitor sees at Hildene is a life lived at very great remove from the hardscrabble frontier existence Americans associate with the young Abraham Lincoln. Robert Lincoln represented a Republican Party leadership more privileged than populist, more comfortable with William Howard Taft (who visited during his unsuccessful re-election campaign in 1912) than with Teddy Roosevelt. Robert Lincoln already owned a substantial house in Chicago when he built Hildene, a mansion with 24 rooms. ''He was a railroad baron, all right,'' our guide remarked.</p>
        <p>Still, the mansion has a homey rather than an imperial air. The rooms are attractively designed but not grand. The library, from which Robert Lincoln ran the Pullman company when he was at Hildene, is small but inviting, decorated with portraits of Abraham Lincoln. The parlor nearby is painted a rose red that Robert Lincoln's wife, Mary, liked.</p>
        <p>After the visit we walked around Manchester, where a neighborhood of stately homes leads up to the town's commercial center, the Equinox Hotel on one side and the county courthouse, with its gold-colored cupola, on the other.</p>
        <p>The Lure of Exploring</p>
        <p>It all seemed very busy and prosperous, the street humming with cars and people bustling off to lunch, the golf course or upscale outlet stores. One could probably settle in pretty comfortably and perhaps not venture elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But if we had done that, we would have missed any number of things -- like finding out just how cooling it is to be inside the battle monument on a very hot day, or discovering that, upon stopping in Shaftsbury, the loudest sound we heard was birdsong.</p>
        <p>And I would have been sorry to have missed the odd tree we found outside our inn in Arlington, the one with a split trunk, an opening just wide enough for a 2-year-old to squeeze through and feel as if he was having an adventure. Our son liked that a lot, and it made for some good pictures.</p>
