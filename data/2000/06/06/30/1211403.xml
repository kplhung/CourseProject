        <p>Consolidated Edison decided in 1997 not to replace the steam generator that would cause an accident at a Westchester County nuclear reactor two and a half years later because the company was uncertain whether the move was a good financial bet in the deregulated market that was developing, according to an internal planning document.</p>
        <p>Some utility industry experts say the document may be the first evidence that electricity deregulation can compromise nuclear safety, a concern that critics have voiced for years.</p>
        <p>The accident, on Feb. 15 at Con Ed's Indian Point 2 nuclear reactor in Buchanan, N.Y., was the most serious in the reactor's 27-year history. A small amount of radioactive steam escaped after corrosion cracked a tube in one of the reactor's four steam generators, which carry superheated radioactive water.</p>
        <p>While no one was hurt and Con Edison says the amount of radiation released was tiny, the accident has had serious consequences, including the shutting of the plant for at least five months, and possibly longer, at a time of tight electricity supplies. It has also complicated the company's efforts to sell the reactor.</p>
        <p>In October 1997, Con Ed financial planners concluded that replacing the reactor's steam generators soon was the cheapest option for customers and shareholders. Their analysis noted that the generators were deteriorating -- a common occurrence in reactors -- limiting how much electricity they could produce. And if the generators were not replaced, they would have to be inspected more often, cutting the number of days the plant could run, according to the planners' document, which was provided to The New York Times by Edward A. Smeloff, a utility expert at Pace University Law School who has been critical of Con Ed's performance in running the reactor.</p>
        <p>But Con Ed's analysis also pointed out that its financial projections were highly sensitive to the price of electricity and that postponing a decision would give the company an opportunity to refine its estimates as the state made its transition to a deregulated electricity market. That transformation happened last November.</p>
        <p>In their analysis, the financial planners accepted a judgment --  which turned out to be wrong -- by Con Ed engineers that the existing steam generators were safe for continued use, although if kept in place they would need an extra inspection each year. As it turned out, Con Ed got permission to skip the extra inspection in 1999; it would have been the last one before the accident.</p>
        <p>Asked about the analysis, a vice president of Con Edison, Steven E. Quinn, said yesterday that the benefit projected for replacing the steam generators -- $85 million over 14 years -- was too small to justify the financial risk, because the uncertainties were so large. He said, though, that those uncertainties were not just the future cost of power but also how well the plant would run after the replacement.</p>
        <p>''The uncertainty on the assumptions was large,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Con Ed analysis compared three options for the reactor: replacing the steam generators and running the plant until its license expired in 2013; not replacing the generators and running the plant until 2013, but at a lower power level and with an extra shutdown every year for inspections, averaging 30 to 36 days; or simply retiring the plant in 1999 or 2001. The first option was judged the least expensive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smeloff, the director of the Pace Law School Energy Project and a former utility manager, said in a telephone interview: ''Even from a shareholder perspective, replacing steam generators in '99 made economic sense. If you assume management was acting in the best interest of shareholders, this is the choice they would have made.''</p>
        <p>But King Look, a section manager in Con Edison's generation planning department and one of the authors of the document, said the problem was that the financial projections were  highly sensitive to electricity prices, and that no one knew how those prices would run in a deregulated  market.</p>
        <p>Con Ed projected that replacing the steam generators would cost $121 million, not including the cost of the equipment itself. Con Ed has replacement generators on site, which it obtained from Westinghouse, the original manufacturer, as part of a legal settlement in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>The company figured that the cost of running the plant until license expiration in 2013 was $1.52 billion; shutting it down in 1999 would cost $59 million more, including replacement power costs, but replacing the steam generators would save $85 million.</p>
        <p>The projections were of ''net present value,'' a common technique in business analysis that means taking interest rates into account and valuing a dollar today more than a dollar a year from now. They assumed an extra annual shutdown for steam generator inspection, and assumed that with new steam generators, the plant's maximum power level could rise 30 megawatts, about 3.5 percent.</p>
        <p>The fear that deregulation may compromise reactor safety has often been voiced but, experts say, seldom if ever borne out. In 1994, Ivan Selin, then chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, reacting to nascent signs of deregulation in California, told reporters that ''even financially sound utilities are under great pressure to reduce their rates, to be competitive; they may be tempted to put off capital investment that we consider necessary to maintain equipment in top shape.''</p>
        <p>Con Edison asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in June for permission to restart the plant with the existing steam generators and run it for up to 10 months without reinspection, although the company now says it will replace the steam generators later this year. The commission is expected to rule next month.</p>
