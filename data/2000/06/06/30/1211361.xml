        <p>The Ford Motor Company won exclusive rights today to negotiate the purchase of South Korea's ailing Daewoo Motor Company with a $6.9 billion offer that if successful would be Ford's largest foreign acquisition and could significantly strengthen its operations in Asia.</p>
        <p>Ford, the world's second-largest automaker, outbid rivals including the top-ranked General Motors Corporation for the right to negotiate a purchase of Daewoo from its creditors.</p>
        <p>The negotiating price, which was higher than had been expected, does not include the assumption of any of Daewoo's estimated $18 billion in debt. Ford now has six weeks to conduct a so-called due diligence review of Daewoo, and could conceivably decide to adjust its offering price or withdraw from negotiations.</p>
        <p>Lee Yong Keun, chairman of South Korea's Financial Supervisory Commission, which has been overseeing the auction process for Daewoo Motor, said Ford ''offered the best terms, and the Daewoo Restructuring Committee and creditors chose it as the exclusive negotiator after what I heard was a difficult selection process.''</p>
        <p>For a while, Ford seemed to be the weakest candidate, as it competed against an alliance of G.M. and Fiat and an alliance of DaimlerChrysler and Hyundai Motor.</p>
        <p>Added to its Mazda Corporation unit in Japan, the acquisition of Daewoo could make South Korea a new production base for Ford in Asia, a region that is expected to lead the world in car sales over the next two decades.</p>
        <p>An acquisition of Daewoo Motor would be just the latest in a string of purchases for Ford. Earlier this year, Ford agreed to buy the Land Rover sport utility vehicle unit from BMW for $3 billion, and last year it purchased the Volvo car operations from Volvo A.B. of Sweden for more than $6 billion.</p>
        <p>At a news conference after the announcement, David Snyder, head of Ford's Asia-Pacific operation, sought to allay concerns by South Koreans that there would be widespread layoffs at Daewoo factories.</p>
        <p>''We will seek the best way for all concerned -- the employees, the suppliers and the creditors and customers -- to normalize operations at Daewoo at the earliest possible date,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Daewoo Motor is capable of producing two million vehicles annually at plants in South Korea and abroad. But last year the carmaker lost $3.9 billion on revenue of $5 billion.</p>
        <p>The choice of Ford was a disappointment for G.M., which had long been considered the favored contender for Daewoo Motor. John Mueller, a G.M. spokesman, declined to disclose what the G.M.-Fiat alliance had bid for the company and did not rule out further efforts to buy Daewoo Motor should Ford's negotiations falter.</p>
        <p>Although creditors and Daewoo officials said they did not expect obstacles in the Ford negotiations, Oh Hogen, head of the Daewoo Restructuring Committee, acknowledged that talks could be held again with the DaimlerChrysler-Hyundai and G.M.-Fiat bidders if no agreement was reached with Ford.</p>
        <p>Although DaimlerChrysler said it was not disappointed, its partner, Hyundai Motor, could face a significant threat from a Ford purchase of Daewoo. Hyundai Motor would have increasing competition in a market where it holds a 65.7 percent stake. Daewoo's market share is estimated at around 32 percent.</p>
        <p>''It means Hyundai Motor would have to expand its relationship with DaimlerChrysler,'' said Joe Lee, an automotive industry analyst at Daiwa Securities.</p>
