        <p>An overloaded ferry appears to have sunk in heavy seas Thursday and officials said today that they feared the loss of nearly 500 people, many of whom were fleeing religion-based killings in the remote Maluku islands.</p>
        <p>Rescuers said that they had found no trace of the ship or of any survivors, nearly 24 hours after the wooden-hulled ship, the Cahaya Bahari, reported in its last radio message that it was taking on water at 1 p.m. Thursday.</p>
        <p>The ferry was lost about 40 miles from land on its route from Halmahera Island, where as many as 200 Christian villagers were killed a week earlier in continuing fighting between Christians and Muslims. It was heading for Manado, the capital of the neighboring province of North Sulawesi, about 1,500 miles northeast of the capital, Jakarta.</p>
        <p>The ship, which was licensed to carry about 250 passengers, had 492 people aboard, including 290 refugees from the massacre at Halmahera, said an official with the National Search and Rescue Agency. He said there were 186 other passengers and 16 crew members.</p>
        <p>Port officials reached by telephone told news agencies they believed that the ferry had sunk. ''Of course, we are afraid many people have died,'' said Ering Musa, a local maritime official. The officials said that several vessels had reached the site where the ship had apparently gone down but that their search was hampered by fog and six-foot waves.</p>
        <p>A sprawling archipelago of thousands of islands, Indonesia is linked by a network of ferries, many of which are poorly maintained and regularly carry far more than their legal load. Disasters are common.</p>
        <p>Apparently the Cahaya Bahari was particularly overloaded because of the panic caused by the fighting, which has killed more than 2,500 people over the last 18 months and has driven thousands of people to flee to neighboring provinces.</p>
        <p>In Ambon, the capital of the Maluku Islands, people reported that the latest surge of terror continued on Thursday despite a state of emergency declared on Monday by President Abdurrahman Wahid.</p>
        <p>Although running street battles between Muslim and Christian gangs appeared to have abated, they said, the continuing sounds of gunfire and bomb blasts and the threat of sniper fire kept people locked in their homes or in refugee centers.</p>
        <p>The French medical aid agency Doctors Without Borders, which has been a mainstay of relief operations in Ambon, said seven truckloads of urgent supplies were stranded at the port because it was too dangerous to transport them. An official with the group, Philip Havet, said supplies of food, medicine and drinking water were running out for refugees and hospital patients.</p>
        <p>The situation appears especially desperate because elements of the military, whose task is to restore order, appear to have taken sides according to their religious affiliations.</p>
        <p>The state-run press agency Antara reported on Thursday that military armored cars shot volleys of gunfire at the majority Christian suburb of Batugantung, forcing people to flee their homes.</p>
        <p>At the Maranata Church in a Christian neighborhood, a priest, Maksianaya, said, ''I myself am afraid to go out because there are still snipers everywhere.''</p>
        <p>On the other side of the divided city, Malik Selang, an official at a Muslim emergency center, said the fear of snipers had forced residents to postpone the removal and burial of a man who had been killed in an earlier round of shooting.</p>
