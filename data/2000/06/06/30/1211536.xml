        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* ''CONTACT'' (Tony winner for best musical, choreography and featured actor and actress). The most potent antidepressant available in New York. Advertising has it that this show from the director and choreographer Susan Stroman is a ''dance play,'' but that hardly captures how it makes you feel. Aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble, Ms. Stroman has created the unthinkable: a sexy, polished work that restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. A theatrical portfolio of three seemingly unrelated vignettes set in different time periods, with top-drawer leading performances from Deborah Yates and the Tony winners Boyd Gaines and Karen Ziemba, ''Contact'' uses an ingeniously selected medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys. But like a classic Rodgers and Hart musical it converts the messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into something as smoothly sweet and tart as a Key lime pie. Both the intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given idealized, elegant form as ''Contact'' weaves romance from a reality we are all familiar with (2:00). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $80 (Ben Brantley).</p>

        <p>*+ ''COPENHAGEN'' (Tony winner for best play, director and featured actress). Who would ever have thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about atomic physics would be such electrifying companions? Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened. Mr. Frayn turns the encounter among the men and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (the Tony-winning Blair Brown), into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, from the fate of the world in the atomic age to the nature of friendship. Under the meticulous direction of Michael Blakemore, with three fiercely passionate performances, the result is a most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas (2:20). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $65; $25 student rush tickets at box office on day of performance (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''KISS ME, KATE'' (Tony winner for best musical revival, director of a musical, musical actor, costumes and orchestration). A mouthwatering revival, with ham as the plat du jour, of Cole Porter's sybarite's delight of a musical about battling egos in show business. As presented by a preening cast led by the wonderful Marin Mazzie and the Tony-winning Brian Stokes Mitchell, who wear a spotlight as if it were a dressing gown and vice versa, this ''Kate'' proves that ham can indeed make a banquet if the spices are zesty enough. Avoiding the attitudes that are anathema to lively revivals of vintage musicals -- reverence and condescension -- the director Michael Blakemore and the choreographer Kathleen Marshall have shaped a show that is broad, brazen and finally irresistible. The production, which doesn't seem to have a thought in its giddy head beyond entertaining us as much as it's entertaining itself, feels like one long ear-to-ear grin. The top-drawer Porter score has been beautifully orchestrated by Don Sebesky and is appetizingly sung by an ensemble that conspicuously features a sharp-edged ingenue named Amy Spanger (2:20). Beck, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $29 to $84 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''THE MUSIC MAN'' A show that makes you feel ridiculously happy one instant and seriously sleepy the next. The director and choreographer Susan Stroman, who created the inspired dance-musical ''Contact,'' isn't as confident in her take on Meredith Willson's jubilant story of a traveling con man who brings rhythm to the stolid town of River City, Iowa. Her transforming imagination stops when the music stops. The production has two perfectly agreeable stars in Craig Bierko, in the title role, and Rebecca Luker, as the frosty librarian who learns to melt. But you get the impression that most of the people onstage are just pretending to live in a land of corn-fed propriety and corny jokes, marking time until a production number comes along to let them show their stuff. When the show is singing or, especially, dancing, it often seems to have winged feet; when it's just talking or clowning around, those feet are flat (2:50). Neil Simon, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE REAL THING'' (Tony winner for best play revival, actor and actress). This immensely appealing revival of the Tom Stoppard play, from the Donmar Warehouse in London, is a rare thing even in what has been an exceptionally strong season for straight plays: an elegant comedy of infidelity filled with the sort of comebacks that people only wish they were capable of themselves. True, Mr. Stoppard's anatomy of a cerebral (and anachronistically romantic) playwright, played with all-conquering charm by the Tony-winning Stephen Dillane, is also always subverting itself, pointing out how some things, love among them, defy glib articulation. But, ah, how articulately it manages to say so. If its structural game-playing seems a tad too clever this time around, few comedies have managed to have it so successfully both ways. David Leveaux is the highly accomplished director. The delectable Jennifer Ehle, a Tony winner and a standout in an exceptionally polished cast, plays the self-possessed object of Mr. Dillane's affections (2:15). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $70 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>''NEIL SIMON'S 'HOTEL SUITE' '' An omnibus show, a repackaging of elements from Mr. Simon's previous ''Suite'' plays, with some rewriting by the playwright. It consists of four hotel room episodes, two visits each to different marriages, each pair a showcase of a separate aspect of the playwright's comic predilections. The first and third reveal Mr. Simon in bittersweet mode; they focus on an English couple, she an accomplished but insecure actress, he an urbane antiques dealer who also happens to be bisexual with a bias toward men. The second and fourth episodes show Mr. Simon's slapstick side as the marriage of a Jewish couple from Philadelphia is tested by familial rites of passage. It's well performed and snappily staged, but with Mr. Simon's retrograde battle-of-the-sexes humor in full evidence the show couldn't be less hip. Still, that's not an entirely terrible distinction; you watch with a kind of campy amazement at the jelled-in-amber social attitudes, the punch-line jokiness of the dialogue and the well-worn clowning. And besides, the nostalgia of it all may well be the point (2:20). Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays, 2:30 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $55. (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>* ''PROOF'' An exhilarating and assured new play by David Auburn that turns the esoteric world of higher mathematics literally into a back-porch drama, as accessible and compelling as a detective story. A mystery about the authorship of a particularly important proof, it is also about twin enigmas: genius and love. Without any baffling erudition the play presents mathematicians as both blessed and bedeviled by the gift for abstraction that ties them achingly to one another and separates them, also achingly, from concrete-minded folks like you and me. Perhaps most satisfying of all, it does so without a moment of meanness. As directed by Daniel Sullivan with the pace of a psychological thriller, and performed by an exemplary cast, most notably Mary-Louise Parker, the play reaches into the most competitive and difficult intellectual terrain and finds -- guess what? -- good people (2:00). City Center Stage 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Weber).  Last Chance</p>
        <p>* ''DAME EDNA: THE ROYAL TOUR.'' Delightfully appalling. In this evening of un relenting self-worship, Dame Edna Everage, the Australian housewife turned superstar, anoints herself the new queen of Broadway, and not without reason. The inspired conception (and alter ego) of the comedian Barry Humphries, Dame Edna combines the insufferable smugness of middle-class complacency with the insufferable smugness of stardom, turning all the world into her adoring acolytes along the way. The show, a testament to Mr. Humphries's status as a great physical comic as well as a loopy social satirist, becomes a lopsided conversation between the dominating Dame and her audience. The production's strength isn't in the jokes (which are of varying quality) but in the uninhibited relish with which they are delivered. Despite some mildly humiliating exercises in audience participation, the show becomes a gleeful, surrealist flight into a bubble-gum-pink empyrean (2:20). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 and $65 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE DIRECTOR.'' This funny, suspenseful and thoroughly entertaining new play by Nancy Hasty uses the con game that we call the theater as a means of exploring the more dangerous deceptions that exist in human relations. In the play, the power struggle between the director of the title and his actors go from teasing sexual games to more sinister exercises that become literally a matter of life and death. Under Evan Bergman's polished direction, the production barrels headlong toward the unknown, taking the audience along for the roller-coaster ride. A fine cast delivers excellent ensemble work (2:15). Arc light, 152 West 71st Street, (212) 279-4200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow and 3 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $37.50 to $40 (Wilborn Hampton).</p>
        <p>+ ''FOOTLOOSE.'' This flavorless marshmallow of a musical, adapted from the popular 1984 movie of the same title, is all about the liberating powers of dancing to rock 'n' roll. But as directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by A. C. Ciulla, the production numbers are less involving than an introductory aerobics class. Built around the story of a dance-crazy kid from Chicago who is transplanted to a strait-laced, Bible-thumping small town, the entire show has a blurry, removed feeling, like a Xerox of a Polaroid. Any grit or spunk that belonged to the movie, which was silly but kind of satisfying, has been sanitized out of existence (2:15). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 to $75 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN'' (Tony winner for best featured actor). Every time Cherry Jones and Gabriel Byrne make physical contact in this heart-stopping production of Eugene O'Neill's great, elegiac love story, the floodgates open to a tide of clashing emotions. The characters they play, an earthy farm woman and a burned-out actor, are as opposite as the quick and the dead. But it is clear that each is wearing a mask that only the other can remove. What makes this ''Moon,'' lovingly directed by Daniel Sullivan, so illuminating is the extraordinary transparency of its stars: their ability to play, and display, all those layers at once. To watch Ms. Jones, Mr. Byrne and the Tony-winning Roy Dotrice react to one another is to realize the degree to which O'Neill's last completed play is about how everyone is an actor, a deceiver by necessity (2:45). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Tickets: $60 and $70; $26 (at box office only) (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''OUR LADY OF SLIGO.'' The great Irish actress Sinead Cusack plays Mai O'Hara, the raging, terminally ill heroine of this drama by Sebastian Barry. And from the production's opening seconds, when Mai abruptly sits up in her hospital bed, this great Irish actress floods the stage with a magnetic force of will that makes you at once want to lean toward her and pull back. ''Sligo,'' while notable for its poetic patterns and phrases, has its stale and repetitive stretches. But Ms. Cusack, who appears far too seldom on these shores, is giving one of those performances that keeps replaying itself in your mind. Under the tender direction of Max Stafford-Clark, her performance burns white-hot, a blinding light amid mortal darkness (2:20). Irish Repertory, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 and $40 (Brantley).</p>
