        <p>Holland Cotter reviews Laylah Ali's gouache-on-paper work at 303 Gallery (S)</p>

        <p>Young American artists continue to deal with political subject matter in interestingly subtle and impersonal ways. Such is the case in the small gouache-on-paper narratives of Laylah Ali, 32, in her first New York solo show.</p>
        <p>Her characters are E.T.-like beings, with dark-skinned, stick-figure bodies and round green heads, set against a plain blue ground. The format is like a cartoon strip, though the scenes aren't comedic. Most of the interactions are coercive. Uniformed police, warriors in helmets, and priestlike figures in tall cone-head caps dominate other figures who appear to be prisoners or slaves, some of whom are physically maimed.</p>

        <p>Young American artists continue to deal with political subject matter in interestingly subtle and impersonal ways. Such is the case in the small gouache-on-paper narratives of Laylah Ali, 32, in her first New York solo show.</p>
        <p>Her characters are E.T.-like beings, with dark-skinned, stick-figure bodies and round green heads, set against a plain blue ground. The format is like a cartoon strip, though the scenes aren't comedic. Most of the interactions are coercive. Uniformed police, warriors in helmets, and priestlike figures in tall cone-head caps dominate other figures who appear to be prisoners or slaves, some of whom are physically maimed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ali skillfully interweaves cultural reference: some costumes look archaic and ''tribal,'' others contemporary. The priests's hats and robes suggest Ku Klux Klan gear.</p>
        <p>The work's graphic clarity and spartan palette bring the serial history paintings of Jacob Lawrence to mind. Where the struggles he dramatized are specific, Ms. Ali's are generic, of a kind always happening somewhere some time. Her light, precise, pictographic touch sharpens them nicely: they are like the killer scenarios of video games reprogrammed with a conscience.</p>
