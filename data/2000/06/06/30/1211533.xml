        <p>TO put it bluntly, ''The Perfect Storm'' is no ''Titanic.''</p>
        <p>This gusty oceanic epic, directed by Wolfgang Petersen (''Air Force One,'' ''Das Boot'') from Sebastian Junger's best-selling book, has lollapalooza special effects and gripping ensemble performances. But its quotient of human drama is finally too stingy for the personal stories of a group of New England fisherman battling ''the storm of the century'' to hit the emotional bull's-eye. When in its final scenes the movie desperately tries to churn up some of the celestial schmaltz of ''Titanic,'' it is too little too late and feels obligatory despite the abundance of heart and chemistry that Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane bring to their roles of a wildly-in-love young couple.</p>

        <p>TO put it bluntly, ''The Perfect Storm'' is no ''Titanic.''</p>
        <p>This gusty oceanic epic, directed by Wolfgang Petersen (''Air Force One,'' ''Das Boot'') from Sebastian Junger's best-selling book, has lollapalooza special effects and gripping ensemble performances. But its quotient of human drama is finally too stingy for the personal stories of a group of New England fisherman battling ''the storm of the century'' to hit the emotional bull's-eye. When in its final scenes the movie desperately tries to churn up some of the celestial schmaltz of ''Titanic,'' it is too little too late and feels obligatory despite the abundance of heart and chemistry that Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane bring to their roles of a wildly-in-love young couple.</p>
        <p>The film's central character (like the book's) isn't a person but an actual storm that blew up the New England coast on Halloween in 1991. But as much as we try to humanize meteorological disasters by naming hurricanes and deciphering their personalities through their histories, storms ultimately don't have feelings or even intentions. Or at least this one doesn't in its movie incarnation. The Weather Channel does a better, more thorough and soberer job of personalizing garden-variety hurricanes than does ''The Perfect Storm,'' which relies on reiterated hyperbole to convey the force of its monster while withholding the kind of detailed meteorological information that might have generated more suspense.</p>
        <p>Hollywood, for all its wondrous special effects, has never been able to get a firm grip on the weather. As impressive as some of its special effects may be, ''The Perfect Storm'' (like ''Twister'' before it) fails to convey the weather's changing moods and the ominously majestic march of events that signal inclement weather. The story follows the fateful voyage of a swordfishing boat, the Andrea Gail, into the North Atlantic as three storms collide offshore and combine to ignite a meteorological explosion.</p>
        <p>Once the movie leaves the shore, a story that began as a richly hued mosaic of life in a New England fishing town (Gloucester, Mass.) quickly succumbs to its own technological wizardry and becomes waterlogged. ''The Perfect Storm'' is so eager for its big waves to arrive as soon as possible that it shoehorns in what feels like an extraneous subplot, lifted from the book, about the rescue of another vessel and the crash of a Coast Guard helicopter. Although these sequences are meant to prepare us for the storm that has yet to overtake the Andrea Gail, they are little more than distracting adventure filler whose characters aren't even introduced, and therefore they mean nothing.</p>
        <p>Anonymity is also a big problem in the movie's middle and later portions, a nearly continuous din of wind and water in which the boat's crew members all but disappear under their slickers while desperately trying to keep their vessel afloat. Every so often the movie hurriedly flashes to shore, where the crew's loved ones huddle around their television sets waiting for news. But the film is so impatient to return to its special effects that these scenes have little resonance.</p>
        <p>As the movie repeats the images of wind and waves over and over, it begins to dawn that the storm in progress is simply too large an event for the movie to take in. Drowned out by the simulated roar of nature (reinforced by James Horner's mediocre, obtrusively pounding score), much of the shipboard dialogue is unintelligible. Even when daring individual rescues are carried out, it's difficult to tell who's saving whom.</p>
        <p>The endless visual whoosh also makes it hard to keep up with the emergency navigational procedures that prevent the boat from breaking apart. And when we don't know quite what's happening, the crew's hard-won victories seem hollow. After a while the unending tumult simply becomes monotonous.</p>
        <p>Although a few tilting shots suggest a boat pitching in the waves, the camera remains level throughout most of the storm, so you rarely have a sense of being tossed about on the ocean. In other words, a dose of Dramamine before the movie is not necessary. In denying us any sense of stomach-churning chaos, the movie keeps the violence at such a far remove that it rarely feels especially scary.</p>
        <p>The money shots are parceled out as carefully (and as parsimoniously) as the movie's personal dramas. The most awesome (familiar from the movie's ubiquitous trailer) comes very late and portrays the boat's head-first climb into a looming 90-foot mountain of water. It is the one stunner in a movie that could have done with two or three more knockout visuals.</p>
        <p>In the end ''The Perfect Storm'' feels like two movies grafted together. The first third is a glowing portrait of Gloucester and the salty, roughneck flavor of its fishing industry. In a series of short but pungent scenes, we meet its fishermen and are introduced to the risky, competitive, low-paying enterprise of swordfish harvesting.</p>
        <p>The movie's vision of this life is unabashedly romantic but convincing, thanks largely to Bill Wittliff's economical screenplay, which keeps its ear attuned to the Yankee dialect. When a fleet arrives back at port, the women ecstatically pour out of their homes to greet their men on the docks, and the town begins to pulse. The sight of tipsy couples in a waterfront bar joyously swaying in each other's arms to the lusty strains of Bruce Springsteen's ''Hungry Heart'' produces a pang of longing to embrace this elemental livelihood and the working-class solidarity that goes with it.</p>
        <p>The movie's Romeo and Juliet, Bobby Shatford (Mr. Wahlberg), a divorced, financially troubled fisherman, and his adoring fiancee, Christina (Ms. Lane), may no longer be teenagers, but they exude the radiant passion of high school sweethearts. These lovers give the movie most of its warmth.</p>
        <p>Although George Clooney has a more substantial role as the boat's captain, Billy Tyne, the character remains an enigma. Mr. Clooney conveys a darkly heroic gravity, but his lack of even a trace of a New England accent makes him seem socially out of place in a cast whose other members get the regional dialect more or less right. The movie tentatively teases us with the possibility that Billy, who has had a run of disappointing catches, will become involved with Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), a fellow fisherman who has her own boat and has had a string of good luck.</p>
        <p>Had the movie envisaged a ''Moby-Dick''-like struggle between Billy and the superstorm into which he steers the Andrea Gail with a reckless determination, ''The Perfect Storm'' might have accrued some heavy allegorical weight. Certainly Mr. Clooney's Billy, with his glowering dark-circled eyes, ruddy, stubbled face and air of impermeable masculinity, suggests a man peering challengingly into the eye of fate. But ''The Perfect Storm'' misses its opportunity to evoke a metaphysical struggle, and it is much the poorer for it.</p>
        <p>In its most solemn moments ''Titanic'' plunged us into a panorama of death, surrounding us with shipwrecked passengers moaning and crying as they slowly froze in the North Atlantic water. In the one comparable image in ''The Perfect Storm'' the camera slowly pulls from a lone man in the ocean to observe him from afar, a speck of life bobbing helplessly on the heaving waves. It's only a glimpse of eternity, and not nearly enough to stir up the awe that is missing from the heart of the film.</p>
        <p>''The Perfect Storm'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and sexual situations.</p>
