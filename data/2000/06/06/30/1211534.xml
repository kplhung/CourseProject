      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Gordon is the epitome of slacker, a slender string of a do-nothing whose passivity is part of his charm. As played by Peter Fenton in the Australian film ''Praise,'' an absorbing tale of sexual obsession, Gordon has a wasted charisma. He's the kind of guy who sits alone at the end of the bar and still radiates a forlorn arrogance.</p>
        <p>He has the look of a poet, if not exactly the soul of one, which is probably what attracts Cynthia (Sacha Horler). She sizes up this Slim Jim, peels away the wrapper and goes to work, and her appetite pulls him into an affair. He is dragged into it by her neediness and her fury, and Cynthia's robust fearlessness is the crucial element in this romantic melodrama, which is so vivid you can smell the anxiety pouring off the lovers' flesh.</p>

        <p>Gordon is the epitome of slacker, a slender string of a do-nothing whose passivity is part of his charm. As played by Peter Fenton in the Australian film ''Praise,'' an absorbing tale of sexual obsession, Gordon has a wasted charisma. He's the kind of guy who sits alone at the end of the bar and still radiates a forlorn arrogance.</p>
        <p>He has the look of a poet, if not exactly the soul of one, which is probably what attracts Cynthia (Sacha Horler). She sizes up this Slim Jim, peels away the wrapper and goes to work, and her appetite pulls him into an affair. He is dragged into it by her neediness and her fury, and Cynthia's robust fearlessness is the crucial element in this romantic melodrama, which is so vivid you can smell the anxiety pouring off the lovers' flesh.</p>
        <p>You can see it on hers, as she suffers from eczema so severe that her skin has huge patches that are mottled and raw; her nerve endings cry out for attention. And if Gordon isn't just the man to give it, then she'll take it from him. (He has physical problems, too, among them asthma and heroin addiction.)</p>
        <p>''Praise'' has been burning up the track on the film festival circuit for two years. I have yet to see it with an audience that hasn't stood outside the theater caught up in conversation afterward. It's Tennessee Williams with the ragged heedlessness of post-punk; it could be more haunted only if the soundtrack included the dolorous moan of the underground rock band Low. (The soundtrack itself, by Dirty Three, is quite good and worth seeking out, though very hard to find.)</p>
        <p>And that glint of trouble is probably what has scared distributors away. As Gordon and Cynthia tumble into a squalid world where they focus more and more on each other, things get worse. Essentially the movie is plotless. The director, John Curran, working with the writer Andrew McGahan, doesn't linger on unrelenting unpleasantness. There are jolts of humor in the big, empty room littered with beer bottles where Cynthia spends most of her time falling all over Gordon.</p>
        <p>''Praise'' is uncanny and sizzling because it has the apparently aimless feel of a bad love affair of youth, the kind of story you would overhear the thoughtless Gordon telling somebody; you would move your chair closer to catch every seamy, and often hilarious, detail. That seemingly floating quality, as the relationship slumps into one bad incident after another, is precisely what Mr. Curran wants. For him the film's explicit detail spells out the compulsiveness of his characters, something that keeps them together.</p>
        <p>Ms. Horler's frank performance is something else that keeps ''Praise'' together. With all the predictable bad taste in films, it's quite something to be startled not by mean-spirited jokes, but by an actress's openness. And her Cynthia, who is given to wearing sleeveless dresses to expose the eruptions on her skin and her soft fleshiness, is utterly aware that she and Gordon are wrong for each other and determined to stay the course anyway.</p>
        <p>Pungent, poignant and full of honest sentiment, ''Praise'' has a complicated emotional intelligence that is hard to come by in movies these days. Some viewers may find the dissipation self-conscious or arty; the meticulousness of Mr. Curran's direction and Dion Beebe's cinematography, as well as the carefully appointed mess of Cynthia and Gordon's living quarters, are hard to miss. Then again, there are always those who look for reasons that a movie that affects them isn't worth their time, even as the picture sticks with them. And ''Praise'' will stick with you. It's more than worthy of its title.</p>
