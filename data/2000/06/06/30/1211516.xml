        <p>One name stands out on the credits of ''Shower,'' a gentle Chinese comedy that opens next week in New York. Among the Chinese personnel -- the director Zhang Yang, the cinematographer Zhang Jian, and Pu Cun Xin, a popular theater actor starring as a prodigal son who comes home to run his father's outmoded neighborhood bathhouse in Beijing -- there is the conspicuously occidental moniker of the producer, Peter Loehr.</p>
        <p>A native New Yorker, Mr. Loehr, 33, is the founder of Imar Film Company. It is the first truly independent film company in China, where production has been channeled through state-owned studios.</p>
        <p>Long fascinated by Asia, Mr. Loehr moved after law school to Japan, where he found a job working for a large Japanese entertainment firm. ''I had been traveling to China for a long time,'' Mr. Loehr said on a recent visit to New York, ''when I rather naively decided that it might be a good idea to go to Beijing and make independent films.</p>
        <p>''It took two years to get the company incorporated, because no one had ever done this before. There was no precedent for me to follow, so it was a very big struggle to get the company up and running and legal. It was a very long process, so obviously I had a lot of time to read scripts and a lot of time to meet with people and learn about the country.</p>
        <p>''Zhang Yang had a script that I thought was really, really special. We got to know each other, and that lead to our first feature, 'Spicy Love Soup.' '' The movie became the second highest grossing film in China in 1998, right behind ''Titanic.''</p>
        <p>''We've always thought that the Chinese audience comes first,'' said Mr. Loehr. ''We do have something to say about China and about Chinese society. 'Shower' is our third film, and we've just finished our fourth, a violent road movie that takes place along the Vietnam border.''</p>
        <p>Unlike many of the movies that have come out of China in recent years, ''Shower'' was not originally designed for export. But when it became a hit on the festival circuit, Sony Classics acquired it for United States distribution.</p>
        <p>''When we started,'' Mr. Loehr said, ''we wanted to lay down some guidelines for ourselves: that we would make modern, urban films for the Chinese audience, that we would work with first-time directors and that we would try to do things differently than the way they were being done, because nothing was working. We had to find a way to compete with the U.S. blockbusters that were coming in, because the market for Chinese films was dying.</p>
        <p>''There aren't really barriers to foreigners, though at the beginning, we did play it very low-key,'' continued Mr. Loehr, who used the Chinese transliteration of his name in the initial publicity. ''The barrier is really that an entirely new system has to be created. We couldn't find a national distributor, so we had to find a way to market and distribute our films ourselves.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Loehr, that has meant making dozens of individual deals with local exhibitors. In less populous regions like Mongolia, he sells prints of his films on a cash basis, just as the pioneer producers did.</p>
        <p>''Playing percentage deals in bigger cities means having agents on site to count the number of admissions,'' Mr. Loehr said, ''to make certain that the theater owner isn't underreporting the gross.''</p>
        <p>Because state-financed Chinese films are always given glowing reviews in the press, Mr. Loehr has found that the occasional negative notice actually works in his favor. ''A bad review makes people curious, because they've never seen one before.''</p>
        <p>Busy Holly Hunter</p>
        <p>''I got offered opportunities last year that I couldn't turn down,'' said Holly Hunter, by way of accounting for her near-ubiquity this season. The Oscar-winning actress (for ''The Piano'') can currently be seen starring in the Showtime feature ''Harlan County War'' and in supporting appearances in ''Jesus' Son'' and ''Time Code.'' Coming up are roles in Rodrigo Garcia's ''Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her'' and Joel and Ethan Coen's ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' And she can also be heard, but not seen, in the Coens' 1984 ''Blood Simple,'' which is being rereleased on July 7.</p>
        <p>Her role as a repressed recovering alcoholic in ''Jesus' Son'' came about when Ms. Hunter was appearing in New York in the play ''Impossible Marriage'' and saw a fellow cast member reading a screenplay. ''I looked at the cover page and saw it was by Denis Johnson, one of my favorite writers, period. So I read it that night and I called the production office in Philadelphia the next day and said, 'I'd like to be in the movie.' And they said, 'Hold on, we'll let you talk to a producer.'</p>
        <p>''It's one of the privileges that I have, of being able to help smaller projects a little bit. It gave this project a little nudge.''</p>
        <p>Adieu to Miramax</p>
        <p>Miramax, the Manhattan-based production and distribution company, has seen some significant executive turnover in the last few weeks. Jason Blum and Amy Israel, both senior vice presidents for acquisitions and co-productions for the company, a Disney-owned mini-major, have left to form their own firm, Blum Israel Productions.</p>
        <p>The new company, based in Los Angeles, has five features and two television shows in active development. (''We promise they'll be good,'' Mr. Blum said by telephone.) It has set up a nonexclusive, two-year ''first look'' deal with Miramax, which means that Mr. Blum and Ms. Israel will be pitching their projects first to their former employers, Bob and Harvey Weinstein, co-chairmen of Miramax.</p>
        <p>Also departing is Cynthia Swartz, who has been with the company's publicity department for 10 years, most recently as the executive vice president in charge of special projects. Ms. Swartz has been coordinating the studio's dauntingly efficient Oscar campaigns for the last several years, racking up 122 nominations and 36 wins for Miramax films, including best picture awards for ''The English Patient'' and ''Shakespeare in Love.''</p>
        <p>In September she will become a senior vice president for publicity at Columbia Pictures, directing the New York office.</p>
        <p>Harvey Weinstein said: ''We loved working with Cynthia and wish her nothing but success. With Jason and Amy we've given birth to producers whose first-look deal will keep them part of the Miramax family.''</p>
        <p>Arts Awards</p>
        <p>The New York Foundation for the Arts paid tribute to two movers and shakers of the independent film world at its annual benefit on Monday night. Barbara Kopple, the Oscar-winning documentary maker (her ''American Dream'' was made with the foundation's support), and Sheila Nevins, who commissions original programming for HBO, were given Champions of the Arts Awards.</p>
