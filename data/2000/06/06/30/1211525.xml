        <p>''Burlesk King,'' a film by the Philippine director Mel Chionglo that  opens today at the Quad Cinema after making the rounds on the international festival circuit, is best described as a curious blend of Italian neo-realism and soft-core pornography.</p>
        <p>The movie's grim, melodramatic slice-of-life view of Manila's sexual demimonde is intercut with dreamy, slow-motion shots of undulating, nearly naked male go-go dancers and with squirming, heavy-breathing sex scenes in which various permutations of gender and number are represented.</p>
        <p>Even more curiously, ''Burlesk King'' isn't especially tawdry or prurient. Rather, Mr. Chionglo's attitude toward his characters, their bodies and what they do with those bodies for love and money is tolerant and affectionate.</p>
        <p>His hero, Harry (Rodel Velayo), is a pouty young hustler who leaves his hometown, Olongapo, along with his best friend, James (Leonardo Litton), for the seedy bustle of Manila, where he finds work as a so-called macho dancer in a nightclub. He also moonlights as a gigolo catering to clients of both sexes. He befriends a lonely romance-novel writer (Raymond Bagatsing) and an upbeat prostitute named Brenda (Nini Jacinto), who dispenses alms and big-sisterly advice to the local street urchins.</p>
        <p>Not everything goes happily. Harry gets involved in drugs and offends Brenda's sensitivities by proposing to pimp for her. For reasons that are not very clear, Harry and James fall afoul of a local harmonica-playing gangster, which leads to some pseudo-Hong Kong fight scenes; really this is a movie with something for every taste.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, these sequences are as haphazardly shot and edited as the sex scenes, and the various plot lines are so disjointed that the film never generates much emotional momentum. Its central dramatic crisis involves Harry's memories of his abusive American father, whose cruelty has soured the young man on Americans altogether, and may, for all I know, be a metaphor for the way the United States has treated the Philippines over the years.</p>
        <p>But politics are the last thing on this movie's mind. Lithe young bodies are its main concern. If all of the gyrations were edited out, ''Burlesk King'' might just eke out an hour of television melodrama. The story might even be easier to follow. But of course no one would bother to watch.</p>
