        <p>Action and drama are in store as a young man in trouble drags his family into a bad situation. Hand that general story line to a major moviemaker, and a couple of years later one can plan on spending at least 130 minutes at the multiplex. The Australian film ''Bloodlock,'' on the other hand, gets the entire tale told in 26 minutes.</p>
        <p>Not counting extras. ''Bloodlock'' is on DVD, one of 11 short films on ''Short 9: Trust,'' to be released Wednesday by Quickband, a Hollywood producer and distributor, and Warner. DVD usually entails added features, and ''Bloodlock'' has a commentary track by its directors, actors and producers, along with deleted scenes and outtakes. In the miniworld of short film, nothing takes too long. On ''Short 9,'' the ninth DVD in a series from Quickband, all 11 films and their extras are over in 160 minutes.</p>

        <p>Not counting extras. ''Bloodlock'' is on DVD, one of 11 short films on ''Short 9: Trust,'' to be released Wednesday by Quickband, a Hollywood producer and distributor, and Warner. DVD usually entails added features, and ''Bloodlock'' has a commentary track by its directors, actors and producers, along with deleted scenes and outtakes. In the miniworld of short film, nothing takes too long. On ''Short 9,'' the ninth DVD in a series from Quickband, all 11 films and their extras are over in 160 minutes.</p>
        <p>''A lot of feature films would benefit by being shorts,'' said Milos Stehlik of Facets Multimedia, a Chicago video distributor and mail order company that carries the first eight ''Short'' discs, each with about 10 short films.</p>
        <p>Rarely seen except at film festivals and on cable, shorts normally run up to 30 minutes. Many are products of young directors on their way to feature filmmaking. Shorts obviously get to the point quickly, but the curious thing about the best of them is that they do a more effective job of storytelling than most full-length features.</p>
        <p>Some films in the ''Short'' series have gone in the opposite direction and been adapted into full-length movies. ''Short 1: Invention'' includes George Hickenlooper's 25-minute ''Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade,'' which was enlarged into an Oscar-winning version by Billy Bob Thornton. ''La Jetee (The Leap),'' Chris Marker's haunting 29-minute short about an emissary from a doomed world sent to get help in the past and future, was the basis for Terry Gilliam's ''12 Monkeys.'' Mr. Gilliam is a fine filmmaker, but Mr. Marker's haunting little movie, made in 1962, got to the story first and, it could be said, more inventively and compellingly.</p>
        <p>The shortest of the shorts, generally in the two-to-six-minute range, are crazy enough to try anything. Charles Stone III's ''True'' was reworked into the ''Whassup'' Budweiser commercials. ''The Big Story,'' a five-minute Claymation film by Tim Watts and David Stoten, stars five caricatures of Kirk Douglas working in a newspaper office.</p>
        <p>Themes are recognizable but the treatments are never standard. In the 20-minute ''Multi-Facial,'' the actor Vin Diesel metamorphoses every which way in search of a role. Alain Resnais's 30-minute documentary ''Night and Fog'' documents the Holocaust in far more gripping ways than many longer films.</p>
        <p>Some of the shorts have won or been nominated for Academy Awards. ''There's always this hue and cry, 'Why have this category?' '' said Sandra Neufeldt of Quickband. ''Nobody watches these films; nobody can see them.''</p>
        <p>Instant access on DVD can help people get acquainted with a large number of them and, in the spirit of the material, quickly. ''DVD makes short-watching comfortable,'' Ms. Neufeldt said.</p>
