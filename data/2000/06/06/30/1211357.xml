        <p>AS Madison Avenue prepared for a long holiday weekend -- most agencies are to close early this afternoon and not reopen until Wednesday -- executives were scrambling to complete a spate of deals.</p>
        <p>Bates North America in New York, part of the Bates Worldwide unit of the Cordiant Communications Group, was concluding plans to expand its offerings into technology advertising by acquiring Donino, White &amp; Partners in Atlanta, a shop with billings estimated at more than $100 million from clients like BellSouth, the Digital and Applied Imaging unit of Eastman Kodak and the UUNet Technologies division of WorldCom.</p>
        <p>The plans call for Bates North America to operate a new unit, named DWP Bates Technology, after acquiring the business assets of Donino, White for a minimum of $30 million in Cordiant stock to be paid over three years. Frank Donino, chief executive at Donino, White, is to become chief executive at DWP Bates Technology, which could later be expanded to other cities.</p>
        <p>Judy Torello, a spokeswoman for Bates, said yesterday that negotiations were continuing and declined to comment further.</p>
        <p>The McCann-Erickson World Group in New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, is expanding into personnel recruitment advertising by buying Nationwide Advertising Service in Cleveland for undisclosed terms.</p>
        <p>Nationwide, with offices in 41 cities in North America, produces print and Internet ads for Fortune 100 companies, governments and universities seeking to fill job openings. Nationwide, with an estimated $400 million in capitalized billings, will operate as an autonomous unit of McCann-Erickson; John Graham will continue as chief executive and Tom Richey as president.</p>
        <p>There were two other deals involving Interpublic, the agency company that also owns Draft Worldwide and the Lowe Group in addition to McCann-Erickson. Interpublic is taking an unspecified minority stake in Software Associates International in Mount Arlington, N.J., which offers customer sales support software and database products for the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
        <p>Software Associates has 170 employees working for clients like Johnson &amp; Johnson; Shaleen Gupta, president and chief executive, continues in that post.</p>
        <p>And Draft, based in Chicago, acquired the Sloan Group in New York, a creative marketing agency that specializes in youth, entertainment and technology advertising. Sloan, which has 50 employees working for clients like HBO, will operate as an autonomous unit of Draft's KBA Marketing division.</p>
        <p>Two other deals are taking place in Britain.</p>
        <p>The Omnicom Group in New York is acquiring Court Burkitt, a London agency formed in 1986. Court Burkitt will be merged with the London office of Griffin Bacal -- part of the DDB Worldwide division of Omnicom -- to form Burkitt DDB under the aegis of BMP DDB, the DDB British agency. Terms of the acquisition, reported by Campaign, the British advertising trade publication, were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Griffin Bacal brings to Burkitt DDB clients like Burberry and Hasbro, while Court Burkitt brings clients like the John Lewis department stores and Peroni beer. Combined billings were estimated at $80 million. At Burkitt DDB, Hugh Burkitt, chairman at Court Burkitt, becomes chairman, while Jonathan Hoare, managing director at Griffin Bacal, becomes managing director.</p>
        <p>''We had an opportunity in London to build an extension of the DDB brand,'' said Tom Griffin, co-chairman and chief executive at Griffin Bacal in New York. ''The case in London is different than the U.S.,'' where Griffin Bacal will continue operating under that name.</p>
        <p>The other British deal concerned Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. in New York, which has agreed to be acquired by the WPP Group. Y.&amp; R. is buying the Partners, a London agency specializing in creative design and brand identity consulting for clients like Harrods, Unilever and Warner Brothers. Terms were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>The Partners, which has 75 employees and revenue estimated at more than $11 million, will become part of the Diversified Communications Group of Y.&amp; R. Aziz Cami, managing partner at the Partners, continues in that post.</p>
        <p>Another brand image and consulting agency, d/g in New York and Paris, agreed to sell a 60 percent stake to Future Source Communications in New York and Toronto, for undisclosed terms. The agency, formerly known as Desgrippes/Gobe, has 175 employees and revenue estimated at $30 million from clients like Coca-Cola and Unilever.</p>
        <p>The top executives at d/g will continue in their posts: Marc Gobe, 54, president and chief executive in New York, and Joel Desgrippes, 55, president and chief executive in Paris.</p>
        <p>Finally, True North Communications in Chicago acquired Event Management and Promotions in Santa Monica, Calif., which will become part of a True North division named Marketing Drive Worldwide. Terms were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Event Management, with more than 40 employees and revenue estimated at more than $10 million from clients like Kellogg and Sony, will be renamed EMP/Marketing Drive. Jamie Wark, 39, president at Event Management, will be president at EMP/Marketing Drive.</p>
