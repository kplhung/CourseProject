        <p>Young Musicians In Museum Battle</p>

        <p>Young Musicians In Museum Battle</p>
        <p>First the singer SHERYL CROW, now 70 journeyman musicians and Juilliard students: the union representing striking workers at the Museum of Modern Art claimed credit yesterday for forcing the cancellation of the first week of the museum's Summergarden concerts.</p>
        <p>The performances tonight and tomorrow would have featured musicians who graduated from the Juilliard School of Music this month or are still enrolled there, along with more experienced performers who belong to Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians. Over the eight-week series, 70 musicians were expected to play -- many in small ensembles, some in a 28-piece orchestra.</p>
        <p>But Local 802 sent letters urging the students not to appear. ''Crossing a picket line is not a great way to start your career,'' the letter said. ''Even though you may not be a union member yet, your future is with the union.''</p>
        <p>ROBERT BATTERMAN, the museum's labor lawyer, took issue with Local 802's letter-writing. ''If it weren't for the fact that we do not wish to embroil students from Juilliard in our problems, we would be seeking legal redress'' against the musicians' union and the museum union under federal labor law, he said.</p>
        <p>The strike by Local 2110 of the United Automobile Workers, which represents the museum's assistant curators, bookshop workers and other administrative workers, began on April 29. Museum officials postponed a May fund-raiser at which Ms. Crow was to perform, saying they did not want her or ticket holders to have to cross a picket line. The two sides remain divided on everything from wages to job security.</p>
        <p>''Our supporters from all corners of the artistic community have been crucial in the course of this strike,'' MAIDA ROSENSTEIN, the president of Local 2110, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Father of the Bride  And of a Cartoon</p>
        <p>Just in time for the movie ''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' TIFFANY WARD was remembering what it was like to grow up amid the adventures of a certain squirrel, a certain moose and a certain father. That would be the animation pioneer JAY WARD, who created the squirrel and moose.</p>
        <p>''I was a child when Rocky and Bullwinkle went on the air, and I was dazzled,'' Ms. Ward said. ''It was on television -- there was a premiere.''</p>
        <p>But there were times when life with father -- her father, anyway -- was too much. Before her wedding, in 1969, for example. ''He said I was much too conservative; I wasn't any fun,'' she recalled. ''He said he would wash his hands of the wedding when I turned down his idea of having a popcorn vendor and monkey grinder inside the church. I was a young bride who kind of wanted this not to be a circus.'' Still, her father hired a skywriter to spell out a message of congratulations.</p>
        <p>''When we got to the reception, the receiving line? Next to me, instead of my live father, was a dummy father. My real father and the comedy writers had done an hour of one-liners. Everybody kept going through to hear the dummy. The piece de resistance, which luckily didn't work out, was he had arranged for the Goodyear blimp to land on the golf course and take us away. It was foggy. They couldn't get clearance to take off.''</p>
        <p>Indigenous Sport  Gets Hall of Fame</p>
        <p>Cooperstown, N.Y., has the Baseball Hall of Fame, and Cleveland has the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. ROBERT R. MacDONALD says Manhattan is about to become home to the stickball hall of fame.</p>
        <p>Mr. MacDonald is the director of the Museum of the City of New York, where the new hall of fame will have its headquarters. ''This is New York's indigenous sport,'' he said, ''and its importance was, there were no economic barriers to play it. All it took to play it was the end of a broomstick and the inside of a tennis ball.''</p>
        <p>So how were the first 14 stickball hall of famers chosen? ''Since there were no statistics, it was basically bragging rights,'' said CARLOS DIAZ, the president of the World Series of Stickball, which begins tomorrow.</p>
