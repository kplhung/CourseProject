        <p>DOUG SAHM: ''San Antonio Rock: The Harlem Recordings 1957-1961'' (Norton). For a pop singer, ''crossing over,'' in the racial sense, almost always means someone of color reaching a white audience; rarely is the reverse even tried. But at 17, Doug Sahm, a white singer from San Antonio, was doing a double twist: making records in a black rhythm-and-blues style for a Chicano audience.</p>
        <p>Later, he would form the Sir Douglas Quintet, a great rock band of the 1960's and 1970's that combined British Invasion pop, urban blues, a touch of West Coast psychedelia and the two-step thump of Tex-Mex conjunto music. But Mr. Sahm never forgot his hometown: in his songs with the quintet, he left a trail of references to San Antonio, enough to convince you that it was a magical place, possibly overlooked among the important American towns of early rock 'n' roll.</p>

        <p>DOUG SAHM: ''San Antonio Rock: The Harlem Recordings 1957-1961'' (Norton). For a pop singer, ''crossing over,'' in the racial sense, almost always means someone of color reaching a white audience; rarely is the reverse even tried. But at 17, Doug Sahm, a white singer from San Antonio, was doing a double twist: making records in a black rhythm-and-blues style for a Chicano audience.</p>
        <p>Later, he would form the Sir Douglas Quintet, a great rock band of the 1960's and 1970's that combined British Invasion pop, urban blues, a touch of West Coast psychedelia and the two-step thump of Tex-Mex conjunto music. But Mr. Sahm never forgot his hometown: in his songs with the quintet, he left a trail of references to San Antonio, enough to convince you that it was a magical place, possibly overlooked among the important American towns of early rock 'n' roll.</p>
        <p>''San Antonio Rock'' explains it all. In San Antonio, a number of things naturally came together: T-Bone Walker's blues, Gulf Coast rhythm-and-blues, country music, an older generation's accordion-driven conjunto. Mr. Sahm absorbed it all, a fiendishly precocious singer and guitarist before he was legally old enough to play in the bars where he plied his trade, with a hoarse, rugged voice that he pushed into gothic swoops, shouts and trills.</p>
        <p>The CD collects the singles he recorded as a member of local bands with swanky names like the Dell Kings, the Mar-Kays, the Twisters and the Pharaohs. His manic version of Larry Williams's ''Slow Down'' is inspired by Little Richard; his own ''Why Why Why'' and ''More and More'' are lovely, slow, tortured ballads, with Fats Domino-style piano triplets and sweet harmonies from two tenor saxophones lining the song like fat fins on an old car. Typical of Norton's rereleases, the CD is well annotated; the liner notes are a full disquisition on the San Antonio scene of the late 50's.</p>
