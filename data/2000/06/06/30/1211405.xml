        <p>Will it be a grand finale over the Statue of Liberty or just another slight to New Jersey? Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City went before television news cameras yesterday to say that he felt slighted by New York City's plans for the annual Macy's fireworks display on July 4.</p>
        <p>''If you are a New Yorker, you get a wonderful half-hour spectacular,'' Mayor Schundler said in a telephone interview. ''If you are one of the million viewers along the New Jersey waterfront, you see five minutes of low-altitude rockets intended to make a nice picture of New York.''</p>

        <p>Will it be a grand finale over the Statue of Liberty or just another slight to New Jersey? Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City went before television news cameras yesterday to say that he felt slighted by New York City's plans for the annual Macy's fireworks display on July 4.</p>
        <p>''If you are a New Yorker, you get a wonderful half-hour spectacular,'' Mayor Schundler said in a telephone interview. ''If you are one of the million viewers along the New Jersey waterfront, you see five minutes of low-altitude rockets intended to make a nice picture of New York.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schundler, a Republican who has hopes of running for governor of New Jersey in 2001, said he had no problem with where the fireworks would erupt; his complaint had to do with when they would light the sky over Liberty Island and for how long.</p>
        <p>As it has for years, the Fourth of July extravaganza is to include fireworks launched from barges near the Statue of Liberty, lighting the sky almost directly in front of Liberty State Park, Jersey City's main viewing area. They will also be launched from barges in the East River and in the Hudson near the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum.</p>
        <p>But Mayor Schundler is objecting to the way in which the huge OpSail millennial event, with 300 military ships from around the world sailing into New York City's waterways over the weekend, is being orchestrated for a national television audience, leaving the fireworks display over Liberty Island for the last five minutes in a sequence of low-altitude pyrotechnics. ''The idea is to provide a nice image of the statue that will be spliced into an incredible show over the East River,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But when reporters told Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani at a news conference yesterday that there was some grumbling from Jersey City over the fireworks, he said that the displays over the Hudson were limited by the logistics of managing huge crowds in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''There is going to be a display for Liberty State Park, too,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''The real problem is we can't shut down the West Side Drive below 23rd Street.''</p>
        <p>The need to keep that stretch of the Manhattan waterfront open to traffic dictated the choices of the Statue of Liberty and the Intrepid aircraft carrier for the city's two main West Side fireworks displays.</p>
        <p>And while Mr. Schundler's complaint may be shared by others after the fireworks explode into the night on July 4, not everyone in New Jersey is troubled by the way the celebration has been planned.</p>
        <p>''We have a better view of the Statue of Liberty than people in Manhattan,'' said Amy Collings, a spokeswoman for Liberty State Park. ''We certainly don't expect any less of a crowd this year,'' she added, saying that 200,000 people were expected to witness the display from the park.</p>
