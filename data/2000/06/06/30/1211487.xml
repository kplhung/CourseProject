        <p>Through July 14</p>
        <p>Two celebrated filmmakers are having second New York gallery solo shows. Steve McQueen, the Englishman who won the Turner Prize last year, presents two significant works, one annoying and one poetic. William Kentridge, the South African known for his surrealistic, politically passionate animated films, offers disappointing nonmoving sculptures, collages and drawings related to a new film.</p>
        <p>Mr. McQueen's black-and-white ''Cold Breath'' (shown as both a full-wall projection and as a DVD video) focuses for 10 silent minutes on the artist's own nipple, which he squeezes, twists, strums and pulls with his thumb and index finger. It is monotonously literal and, with its tinny echoes of Bruce Nauman, Vito Acconci and Matthew Barney, tiresomely academic.</p>

        <p>Two celebrated filmmakers are having second New York gallery solo shows. Steve McQueen, the Englishman who won the Turner Prize last year, presents two significant works, one annoying and one poetic.

        <p>Mr. McQueen's black-and-white ''Cold Breath'' (shown as both a full-wall projection and as a DVD video) focuses for 10 silent minutes on the artist's own nipple, which he squeezes, twists, strums and pulls with his thumb and index finger. It is monotonously literal and, with its tinny echoes of Bruce Nauman, Vito Acconci and Matthew Barney, tiresomely academic.</p>
        <p>''Current,'' a slow slide projection piece, is better. It presents the overhead view of a bicycle submerged in a stream. One wheel, catching the sun, is a bright circle of light; the other is a dark ring. As the slides fade in and out, the bicycle's position shifts slightly and the watery surface changes. It all produces a rich poetry of darkness and light, geometry and flux, abandonment and recovery.</p>
        <p>The main attraction of Mr. Kent ridge's show is a procession of foot-high puppetlike figures, cast in bronze from originals made of clay and found materials like tools, twigs or an espresso pot. Some carry heavy loads and some are Bosch ian hybrids, like a man with a megaphone for a head.</p>
        <p>It is easy to imagine them animated in one of the artist's haunting films, but as static figures they are missing an essential, life-giving magic.</p>
