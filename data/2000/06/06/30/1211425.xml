        <p>A federal judge has cited New York's largest union of restaurant workers for contempt of court after finding that it defamed the Metropolitan Opera and improperly harassed its board members as part of an effort to unionize 95 restaurant workers at the Met.</p>
        <p>Judge Loretta A. Preska of Federal District Court in Manhattan also issued an injunction barring the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union from holding demonstrations or distributing leaflets that defame the Met by, for example, accusing it of having a bad reputation for labor relations.</p>
        <p>She found that the union was dishonest in asserting that it had a labor dispute with the Met when its main dispute was with Restaurant Associates, the subcontractor that runs the restaurants at the opera house. In the past year, federal officials have charged the company with 26 unfair labor practices at the Met.</p>
        <p>Michael Anderson, a lawyer for Local 100 of the union, said the decision should be overturned, calling it a rare instance of prior restraint on speech as well as a broad attack on the union's First Amendment rights.</p>
        <p>Judge Jose Cabranes of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has granted the union's request for an expedited review of Judge Preska's decision.</p>
        <p>Judge Preska ruled that the union had repeatedly defamed the Met in its leaflets and in chants. The ruling could go far to curb an often effective, increasingly popular tactic in which unions mount a pressure campaign against a company or other institution over the labor practices of its subcontractors.</p>
        <p>In the New York dispute, the union has failed to persuade Restaurant Associates to adopt an expedited way to recognize the union by collecting employee signatures rather than holding an election. So the union has decided to focus its pressure tactics on the far more visible Metropolitan Opera and on its board members, in effect asking the Met and its board to put pressure on Restaurant Associates to agree to the expedited way of granting union recognition.</p>
        <p>The union has repeatedly accused the Met of supporting unfair labor practices, arguing that the Met, having hired Restaurant Associates, shares the responsibility for how the food service workers at the Met are treated. But Judge Preska concluded that such arguments, often made in leaflets and at demonstrations, were defamatory, because, she found, the Met was not involved in the dispute.</p>
        <p>The union's lawyers called Judge Preska's injunction unusual because it enjoins nonviolent union protests.</p>
        <p>''Judge Preska's order is a prior restraint on the content of speech,'' said Mr. Anderson, the lawyer. ''It has the effect of suppressing the union from making an important argument about the most compelling issue for 21st century labor policy, that is the responsibility of an institution like the Met for the labor practices of its subcontractors.''</p>
        <p>Judge Preska issued her decision orally on June 8, and officials with the Met released a transcript of the decision on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Judge Preska faulted the union for harassment, saying it wrongly distributed fliers saying that Met board members and donors, among them Christie's, the auction house, and Alberto Vilar, the investment manager on the Met's board, supported unfair labor practices.</p>
        <p>The judge also found that the union had illegally harassed the Met's honorary chairman, Donald Crawford, the longtime chairman of the Omnicom Group, the advertising giant, by having union supporters distribute leaflets and ask hostile questions at Omnicom's board meeting.</p>
        <p>The judge seemed especially angry over the way union members threatened unspecified repercussions against a small Manhattan furniture dealer, Scully and Scully, if that company continued its annual practice of donating a piece of furniture toward an auction that raised money for the Metropolitan Opera Guild, an affiliate of the Met that donates money to musical education.</p>
        <p>The judge also said accusations of  poor labor practices were false because the Met is generally known for good relations with its 17 unions.</p>
        <p>''It has been demonstrated that substantial injury to the Met's reputation and good will has resulted from the union's acts and will continue to result unless those acts are restrained,'' she wrote in enjoining defamatory statements by the union.</p>
        <p>Over the past year, the National Labor Relations Board has charged Restaurant Associates with 26 unfair labor practices at the Met, including firing one worker and failing to give raises to another because they supported the union. Without admitting guilt, Restaurant Associates has settled all those charges, rehiring the one union supporter and giving raises to the other.</p>
        <p>Henry Tamarin, president of Local 100, said, ''Restaurant Associates employees located at the Metropolitan Opera House are continuing to work together to win the right to organize despite a nasty anti-union campaign waged by the employer.''</p>
        <p>The union has demanded that Restaurant Associates grant union recognition based on authorization cards signed by workers at the Met. The union said 76 of the 95 workers have signed cards saying they want to join Local 100. Saying an election would be fairer, Restaurant Associates insists that the workers vote on the issue. The union says it fears the company will intimidate workers into voting against the union.</p>
        <p>Sharon E. Grubin, the Met's general counsel, said the opera would not pressure Restaurant Associates. ''The Met wants to stay neutral in this dispute,'' she said. ''If these workers wish to be in Local 100, that's just fine.''</p>
