        <p>A politically potent coalition of 69 health plans, several large employers, unions and consumer advocates is beginning a broad campaign to slow the surge in spending on prescription drugs. They hope to counter drugmakers' huge marketing and advertising campaigns directed at doctors and consumers.</p>
        <p>The coalition, Rx Health Value, includes Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Kaiser Permanente and 21 other independent nonprofit managed care companies. Together, they have 83 million members. Other members include General Motors; GTE; U S West; the pharmacy benefits manager PCS Health Systems; several employer-sponsored health care associations; the A.F.L.-C.I.O.; the United Automobile Workers; American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; American Hospital Foundation; and AARP.</p>
        <p>The new group, whose members have a clear stake in cutting drug costs, plans to move on a number of fronts to try to blunt what it sees as a distortion of the health care system by the long-running marketing success of drugmakers.</p>
        <p>Among other things, the group plans to tell doctors and consumers about independent studies showing which drugs, old and new, are most effective, and will seek to increase the influence of consumers in Washington.</p>
        <p>The pharmaceutical companies spent $13.9 billion to market drugs in 1999, including pitches to doctors and advertising aimed at consumers. That was over 50 percent more than they spent in 1996, before regulators opened the way to a torrent of advertising directed at consumers. Coalition members say that has contributed to a steep rise in drug spending. Fueled by heavily advertised, expensive new products, national spending on prescription drugs has more than doubled since 1992, to an estimated $101 billion last year.</p>
        <p>Pressure is growing to spend even more. Research in biotechnology and the human genome promise a host of new products. And the House voted on Wednesday to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs, a change that is projected to add billions of dollars annually to spending.</p>
        <p>At many companies that offer generous health coverage, spending on drugs is increasing more than 20 percent annually. The prescription drug costs of insured individuals rose 29 percent annually between 1996 and 1999, researchers at Brandeis University said in a study sponsored by Rx Value Health.</p>
        <p>An organization sponsored by Blue Cross, RX Intelligence, is to begin operating today and will undertake clinical studies seeking to show which new drugs are a clear improvement. The Rx Health coalition plans to combine the findings of Rx Intelligence with analyses of the drugs' cost effectiveness and other issues and report the findings to consumers, employees, health plans and, especially, doctors and nurses who write prescriptions.</p>
        <p>It also plans to use its influence ''to get a consumer perspective in front of Congress and the regulatory agencies,'' said Barry Sloat, director of health care business strategy at Ford Motor and the auto industry's liaison to Rx Health Value.</p>
        <p>It will not be easy. With breakthroughs in biotechnology and genome research, ''expenditures on prescription drugs are going to rise very rapidly,'' said Robert D. Reischauer of the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research center.</p>
        <p>Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, said consumer advertising was worthwhile because it motivated people to consult doctors, who then found and treated previously undiagnosed problems. He said drug prices were justified because ''it's a very high-risk industry with a long time horizon'' for developing products. This year, makers will spend $26 billion, or 20 percent of revenue, finding new drugs and winning approval for them.</p>
        <p>Drug makers also contend that even expensive drugs save money because they enable many patients to stay out of the hospital. ''Our medicines are the most cost-effective part of our health care system,'' Mr. Holmer said.</p>
        <p>As an example, he said, government studies show that expensive ''clot-buster'' drugs reduce the need for hospital, rehabilitation and nursing home care, saving more than twice the cost of the drug.</p>
        <p>Coalition members contend that advertising does not provide a full picture of both the limitations and the benefits of new drugs. In May, in one of its first public moves, the coalition called on the Food and Drug Administration to tighten controls on television drug advertising, which climbed 70 percent last year, to $1.13 billion, according to IMS Health, a market research company.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jane E. Henney, the F.D.A. commissioner, said the agency was reviewing its advertising policies.</p>
        <p>Veronica Goff, vice president of the Washington Business Group on Health, a group of large employers that supports the coalition, said, ''We want to make sure that balanced, complete information gets out to consumers.''</p>
        <p>And Dan Wolfson, chief executive of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, which includes Kaiser, and a founder of the new coalition, said: ''Everybody I know over 40 is on a medication. What we don't know is the benefit.''</p>
        <p>He said Celebrex, a relatively new and expensive pain killer, is a case in point. Last year, Celebrex, part of a new class of genetically engineered drugs, was prescribed for 25 percent of people diagnosed with arthritis. But Celebrex is intended for patients who have intestinal bleeding when they use other arthritis treatments. ''We would think only 3 to 5 percent would be getting it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Largely because of consumer advertising, ''we perceive substantial overuse, misuse and underuse'' of drugs, Mr. Sloat of Ford said.</p>
        <p>''If the drug industry is going to grow at 20 percent while everything else is growing at 3 percent, this is going to be a huge issue for national policy,'' he added.</p>
        <p>At DaimlerChrysler, for example, drug costs will be close to $300 million this year, almost as much as Chrysler's entire cost for employee health benefits in the early 1980's and a 17 percent increase over 1999, said Walter Maher, vice president for public policy.</p>
        <p>The rapid increase in spending on drugs since drug companies began advertising has reached a point where it is increasingly recognized as causing pain throughout the health care system. ''Everyone is feeling it,'' said John Rother, public policy director of AARP. ''Everyone has a stake in the cost of drugs.''</p>
        <p>Managed care companies have shifted a growing share of drug costs to patients by raising deductibles and co-payments, but they still face double-digit cost increases, which they pass along in higher premiums.</p>
        <p>Drug spending is so high that even in the current tight labor market, unions are increasingly contending with unwanted choices when they negotiate new contracts: less money for health care or less for wages and retirement benefits. ''This is a huge issue,'' said Gerry Shea, an assistant to the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the drug industry, which spends about $75 million annually to lobby members of Congress and federal regulatory agencies, has usually had its way in Washington. Drug companies have received support from business groups like the National Association of Manufacturers. Drug costs are ''a delicate issue for the N.A.M., because the pharmaceutical manufacturers are members,'' Mr. Maher said.</p>
        <p>In addition, using a variety of special-interest organizations like Citizens for Better Medicare, the drugmakers have fended off attempts to pass laws or rules that might lead to lower prices. In 1997, the industry received permission from the F.D.A. to increase advertising to consumers. Drugmakers also won the right to help pay for administrative reviews of new drugs. Approvals rose by more than 50 percent in the 1990's, Mr. Holmer said.</p>
        <p>Rx Health is seeking to marshal ''enough heft so it can speak with an equal voice to the pharmaceutical industry,'' said John Golenski, executive director of the new group and a longtime consultant to Kaiser Permanente in California.</p>
        <p>''Research is producing new and better drugs,'' said Alain Enthoven, a health care expert and a professor of management at Stanford University. But, he added, ''high-quality, independent cost-benefit analysis is needed to determine if they are all worth the cost.''</p>
