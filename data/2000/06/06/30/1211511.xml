        <p>After months of intense negotiations, the National Gallery of Art in London announced today that it was acquiring its first painting by Cimabue, the 13th-century Italian painter and mosaicist who paved the way for early Renaissance artists.</p>
        <p>''The Madonna and Child Enthroned With Two Angels'' (circa 1285), an 8-by-10-inch wood panel on gold ground, was discovered by Sotheby's experts when they went to catalog old master paintings at Benacre Hall, a Palladian villa near Lowestoft in Suffolk, England. The painting was being sold by the estate of Sir John Gooch, who died last year and whose family had lived at Benacre Hall since the early 19th century.</p>

        <p>After months of intense negotiations, the National Gallery of Art in London announced today that it was acquiring its first painting by Cimabue, the 13th-century Italian painter and mosaicist who paved the way for early Renaissance artists.</p>
        <p>''The Madonna and Child Enthroned With Two Angels'' (circa 1285), an 8-by-10-inch wood panel on gold ground, was discovered by Sotheby's experts when they went to catalog old master paintings at Benacre Hall, a Palladian villa near Lowestoft in Suffolk, England. The painting was being sold by the estate of Sir John Gooch, who died last year and whose family had lived at Benacre Hall since the early 19th century.</p>
        <p>It is one of only seven or eight independent panel paintings by Cimabue in existence and the only one in private hands. It is the first work by the artist to enter any museum collection in England.</p>
        <p>''The Gallery tries to tell the story of Italian painting from the Renaissance, and every history book begins with Cimabue,'' said Neil MacGregor, the museum's director. ''But we didn't have one. We've waited 170 years to find this.''</p>
        <p>The Cimabue was to be auctioned at Sotheby's sale of old master paintings in London next Thursday but was withdrawn today after the government decided to accept the Cimabue in lieu of estate taxes and present it to the National Gallery.</p>
        <p>The Gooch estate will be given a tax break of $6.87 million, and Sir Paul Getty, a son of J. Paul Getty and a longtime supporter of the museum, has paid an additional $1.05 million to the Gooch family in compensation for the painting.</p>
        <p>Sir Timothy Gooch, an heir, said in a statement issued by Sotheby's that he was ''delighted that the painting had been acquired in this way for the national collection, even though this represented a financial sacrifice'' on the part of the family.</p>
        <p>When Sotheby's announced in February that it had discovered the Cimabue, the National Gallery made it clear that it wanted the painting. But if the panel had gone to auction and been sold to an institution or collector outside Britain, the Government would probably not have given it an export license without trying first to find a British institution that could match the buyer's price.</p>
        <p>Experts say that Sotheby's was at first reluctant to make a deal on behalf of the estate because its executives believed that the painting could get a bigger price at auction. The executives soon realized, however, that news of the National Gallery's interest would probably discourage other institutions from bidding.</p>
        <p>Talks between the National Gallery and the estate began in February but were unsuccessful because at that point the estate did not have such a large tax bill to bargain down. Then in May, Sotheby's sold the contents of Benacre Hall in a three-day sale that grossed $12.5 million, a record for a country house auction, which left the estate with a larger tax bill than it had anticipated.</p>
        <p>Estimates of what the Cimabue would bring also soared. In February, Sotheby's experts said they believed that it could fetch $3 million. In March, they revised the estimate to $7.5 million, and last month to $15.1 million.</p>
        <p>''When we first announced the sale, we were testing the waters,'' said Alexander Bell, head of Sotheby's old master painting department in London. ''We didn't have anything to compare it to.'' But as interest in the panel mounted, so did the price. ''There has been great institution and private interest outside the U.K.,'' Mr. Bell added.</p>
        <p>''The Madonna and Child Enthroned With Two Angels'' is part of a small tabernacle, a portion of which is in the Frick Collection in New York. After tests to determine the age of the wood and pigments, Sotheby's consulted Dillian Gordon, the curator of early Italian paintings at the National Gallery, who, with Sotheby's experts, concluded that it was by Cimabue.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's also took the panel to New York to study it alongside the Frick's Cimabue panel. It was then, Mr. Bell said, that experts decided that it was undoubtedly by Cimabue. ''It must be the most important early Italian picture to have been on the market in a generation,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Guggenheim Finalists</p>
        <p>The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum has announced the international finalists for its Hugo Boss Prize. The $50,000 award, named for the German men's wear company that is its sponsor, is given every two years to an artist whose work represents a significant development in contemporary art.</p>
        <p>The finalists, ranging in age from 29 to 60, are all interested in work relating to public space. The winner is to be announced in November.</p>
        <p>The finalists are Vito Acconci, 60, an American Conceptual artist; Maurizio Cattelan, 40, an Italian artist perhaps best remembered for a performance piece at the 1999 Venice Biennale in which he hired an Indian fakir to lie buried in sand for several hours at a stretch with only his hands protruding; Michael Elmgreen, 39, a Dane, and Ingar Dragset, 31, a Norwegian, both of whom live and work in Berlin and create sculptural installations; Tom Friedman, 35, an American sculptor; Barry Le Va, 59, an American Post-Minimalist sculptor; Marjetica Potrc, 47, a Slovene known for architectural installations, and Tunga, 48, a Brazilian sculptor and performance artist.</p>
        <p>''It's not the usual suspects,'' said Lisa Dennison, a deputy director at the Guggenheim and its chief curator. ''These artists span three generations.'' The Hugo Boss Prize sets no restrictions on age or nationality.</p>
        <p>Asked why no painters were among the finalists, Ms. Dennison said: ''There were plenty of painters nominated, but none were chosen. What this list shows is an international group of contemporary artists who reflect a trend we're seeing in art that engages public spaces.''</p>
        <p>Because of tight scheduling and a lack of space, Ms. Dennison said, the Guggenheim will show only the winner's work rather than organizing an exhibition of the finalists' work as it did in past years. But the museum will publish a catalog of the finalists' work. The show is to open in February.</p>
