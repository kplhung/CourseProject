        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>''CARMEN,'' Opera Festival of New Jersey. The festival opened its season with Bizet's ''Carmen,'' one of the most popular operas ever written. But this inventive summer company has more unusual fare in store for later in the season, including Hugo Weisgall's ''Six Characters in Search of an Author'' and ''Burning Bright,'' by Frank Lewin, a Princeton native. ''Carmen'' features Suzanna Guzman in the title role, Gerald Powers as Don Jose and Kristopher Irmiter as Escamillo. Michael Ching conducts, and Elizabeth Bachman, in her festival debut, is the stage director. Catered dinners are available for picnics before the performances on the grounds of the Princeton Theological Seminary. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., McCarter Theater, 91 University Place, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-2787. Tickets: $24 to $82 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>

        <p>''FALSTAFF,'' Opera Festival of New Jersey. The bass-baritone Mark Delavan has impressed critics and audiences at the Glimmerglass Opera festival and the New York City Opera with his vocally splendid and dramatically vivid portrayal of Verdi's Falstaff. This native of Morristown, N.J., is singing the role in his home state this summer. The strong cast includes Victor Benedetti as Ford, Juliana Rambaldi as Alice Ford, Jonathan Boyd as Fenton and, in her company debut, Kristen Plumley as Nanetta. Willie Anthony Waters conducts. Tonight at 8, McCarter Theater, 91 University Place, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-2787. Tickets: $24 to $82 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''RIGOLETTO'' AND ''MADAMA BUTTERFLY,'' Metropolitan Opera in the Parks. This summer is the 34th consecutive year of Met in the Parks, the company's popular free series of operas in concert performance. This weekend the traveling company goes first to Connecticut, performing ''Madama Butterfly'' tonight in New Haven. A highly touted Hungarian soprano, Georgina Lukacs, sings the title role, with Paul Charles Clarke as the callow American naval lieutenant B. F. Pinkerton. Julius Rudel conducts. Then the company moves to New Jersey to close the season with ''Rigoletto'' tomorrow night at Waterloo Village. The cast retains several members of the fine one that sang the work recently in Central Park, including Carlo Guelfi in the title role. Nello Santi conducts.

        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. There are few better places in the city to hear chamber music than this barge floating on the East River, with its live, intimate acoustics and its spectacular view of Lower Manhattan. Good weather will only enhance the experience, and the performances are often as fine as the setting. Here, Fred Sherry, a fine cellist who coordinated the programs, is joined by other performers, including James Winn, a pianist. The big piece tonight and on Sunday, is Schumann's D minor Piano Trio (Op. 63); tomorrow, it is a Beethoven Trio in B flat (Op. 11). Both programs are filled out with works by Stravinsky and Elliott Carter. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, and Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-4061. Tickets: $27; $25 for the elderly; $15 for students (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>BOSTON SYMPHONY CHAMBER PLAYERS. The Boston Symphony, in its full form, does not take up residence at Tanglewood for another week, but its envoys -- the Boston Symphony Chamber Players -- are playing two concerts this weekend. The first, tonight, includes the Mozart Flute Quartet in D, Janacek's wind sextet, ''Mladi,'' and a chamber version of the Brahms Serenade No. 1. On Sunday, the ensemble is offering Britten's Sinfonietta, Copland's Sextet and Mozart's String Quintet in G minor. Tonight at 8:30 and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Seiji Ozawa Hall, Tanglewood, Lenox, Mass. (888) 266-1200. Tickets: $26 to $33; lawn seats are $12.50. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>CARAMOOR. Set on a large estate with beautifully kept gardens and some extremely quirky architecture, Caramoor is one of the more pleasant locations for outdoor summer performances. Vocal music has the center stage for much of this weekend. Tonight, a vocal quartet -- Laura Danehower Whyte, soprano; Julia Fischer, mezzo-soprano; Francisco Almanza, tenor; and Valeriano Lanchas, bass -- offer a program called ''The Whirl of the Dance,'' with music by Bach, Brahms, Schubert, Chopin, Ravel, Rossini, Puccini, Strauss and Sondheim. They are to be accompanied by Rachelle Jonck and Giovanni Reggioli, pianists. Tomorrow, the cabaret singer Andrea Marcovicci is to be joined by the Orchestra of St. Luke's, Caramoor's resident ensemble, for a concert of American songs of the last century. Glenn Mehrbach is the conductor. For a change of pace, the Orchestra of St. Luke's is offering an all-Vivaldi concert on Sunday afternoon. ''The Whirl of the Dance'' is tonight at 8. Tickets: $25. Ms. Marcovicci's performance is tomorrow at 8:30. Tickets: $25 to $75. The Vivaldi concert is Sunday at 4:30, with a preconcert extravaganza, free to ticketholders, beginning at 1:30 p.m. Tickets: $15 to $45. Caramoor, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-1252 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>MAVERICK CONCERTS. This enterprising chamber music series, now in its 85th season, offers concerts in an open-sided barn where the sounds of nature and the music of man interact freely. After two kick-off weekends it is now in full gear. The pianist Grant Johannesen is playing a nicely varied recital tomorrow, with a Bach Toccata and Beethoven's ''Eroica'' Variations, as well as works by Chopin and Debussy. On Sunday afternoon, the Miami String Quartet and the oboist Humbert Lucarelli are collaborating on a program that includes the premiere of Robert Starer's new ''Maverick Variations,'' Bach Partita (BWV 1013) arranged for solo oboe, and two classic quartets, Haydn's ''Rider'' and Schubert's ''Death and the Maiden.'' The Starer is by no means the first premiere to be given at Maverick: John Cage's silent work, ''4'33,'' was composed for the series, part of its point being to get listeners to hear the music that was unfolding around them at all times. Mr. Johannesen plays tomorrow at 8 p.m.; the Miami String Quartet and Mr. Lucarelli perform on Sunday at 3. Maverick Concerts, Maverick Road, one mile from the junction of Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., just outside Woodstock. (914) 679-8217. Tickets: $15 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>TANGLEWOOD MUSIC CENTER ORCHESTRA. In addition to being the summer home of the Boston Symphony, Tanglewood offers a training program for talented young instrumentalists and conductors as well as concerts by those players throughout the summer. In the first concert of the season, Seiji Ozawa, Andre Previn and Robert Spano are to lead the students of the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra in a program that includes Copland's ''Grohg'' and Elgar's ''Enigma'' Variations. Sunday at 8:30. Seiji Ozawa Hall, Tanglewood, Lenox, Mass. Tickets are $10 and are available an hour before concert time. (Kozinn).</p>

The living will be celebrated and the dead remembered in new works by Roberto Villenueva, Martial Roumain and the company's director, Enrique Cruz DeJesus,  and old works by Gary DeLoatch and Al Perryman, whose ''Tell It to the Lord,'' set to gospel music and a speech by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., has been restaged by Mr. DeJesus. Tonight and tomorrow at 8. Tickets: $15; $10 for students, the elderly and the disabled.

        <p>DOUGLAS DUNN. ''The Common Good'' represents a meeting of choreographic minds. By asking various members of the dance world to contribute specific movements and thematic ideas to his new work for seven dancers and to tell him what they do and don't like about dancing, Douglas Dunn seeks to investigate aspects of the creative process. Tonight, tomorrow night and Sunday night at 8:30, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $12 (Jack Anderson)</p>
