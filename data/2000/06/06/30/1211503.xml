        <p>The second-biggest decorating job in the 18th-century, after Versailles, was not in France, England or Spain. It was the 608-room Royal Palace in Stockholm. This palace, which is now partly open to the public, is considered the largest royal city residence still occupied by a king and queen.</p>
        <p>The original Royal Palace suffered a disastrous fire in 1697 and had to be rebuilt -- a process that took 54 years. Most of the interiors were created by Carl Harleman, who, when hired, was a 27-year-old architect who had never built a thing. Harleman worked on the palace for 26 years; in fact, until he died at age 53, the year he completed it.</p>
        <p>Harleman, who is scarcely known in the United States, is credited with introducing the rococo style to Sweden and giving it a distinctly Swedish flavor. ''Harleman may have been trained by the French, but he added something Swedish to the rococo that made it his own,'' said Magnus Olausson, a curator at the National Museum in Stockholm.</p>
        <p>The National Museum has opened an exhibition of Harleman drawings from its own collection to celebrate the 300th anniversary of his birth (through Sept. 10). There are exquisite freehand sketches as well as plans for villas, gardens, household goods like silver tureens and textiles, even a sarcophagus for King Carl XII. There are sketches of the many church towers he designed, and they continue to give Stockholm its distinctive skyline.</p>
        <p>Lars Sjoberg, a senior curator at the museum for the last 26 years, explained the appeal of Harleman's work. ''French rococo is ornate and elaborate, with arabesque elements, shells, scrolls, branches and flowers seen in all kinds of ormolu mounts and veneers,'' he said. ''In Sweden, our best architects, like Harleman, refined the rococo style. He took away any decoration that was not necessary and made the rococo functional. Even the sinuous curves in his chairs were not designed only for the eye; they were engineered to fit the body.''</p>
        <p>Americans who love the Swedish antiques they find at specialist dealers like Eleish &amp; Van Breems of Woodbury, Conn. (www.evbantiques.com) and the reproductions made by Swedish Room (973 644-4775), will find Harleman's work a revelation. Everything admired about Swedish style -- the classical proportions, the pale palette, the charming textiles -- can be traced back to him. He created the forerunner of the Swedish Royal Academy of Fine Arts, so his work was passed down to generations of architects and craftsmen.</p>
        <p>The Royal Palace, occupied in 1754 by King Adolf Fredrik and Queen Lovisa Ulrika, has been redecorated over the centuries. But Harleman's royal chapel is almost unchanged, as is the magnificent lacy, gilded stucco work on the ceiling in the queen's antechamber.</p>
        <p>Perhaps a better way to see Harleman's work is to visit two of his manor houses in the Stockholm area. Because of the exhibition, the state has opened Svartsjo Palace, a small royal hunting castle Harleman designed in 1731 on the shore of Lake Malaren, the largest lake in Sweden. It can be visited this summer; in the fall it will be rented.</p>
        <p>It looks a bit like a French chateau, albeit one with a clock tower added to the roof. Its two-story great hall with trompe l'oeil windows, faux marble walls and unpainted wide-plank pine floors have all been restored to their initial style. The 10 rooms on the ground floor have been furnished with 18th-century portraits and antiques, including a rococo mirror Harleman designed, with his signature gilded bird wings flying off the frame.</p>
        <p>As both the son and grandson of royal gardeners, Harleman was initially trained as a garden designer. His Svartsjo garden is gone, so it is impossible to see how he introduced vegetables into a formal garden. As Mr. Olausson explained: ''In France, there was a division between a pleasure garden and a potager. Harleman had the idea to unite utility with pleasure, by converting the formal garden into a kitchen garden.''</p>
        <p>Harleman's early houses were much emulated. ''Svartsjo was the model for all the manor houses built in the 18th century,'' said Mr. Sjoberg, who owns five of them and is the co-author, with his wife, Ursula, of ''The Swedish Room,'' published in English by Frances Lincoln in 1994.</p>
        <p>Harleman's second manor house, the Svindersvik Pavilion, is now an adjunct branch of the Nordic Museum in Stockholm. Built as a summer retreat in about 1750 for Claes Grill, a director of Sweden's East India Company, it is a small villa overlooking a bay of the Saltsjon Sea on the eastern approach to Stockholm.</p>
        <p>It is a one-story building with a pedimented two-story bay in the center. This house, with only seven rooms, still has its apple orchard, red barns, separate kitchen and a neo-Classical party annex. With its high ceilings, large windows and symmetrical floor plan, it is a study in refined simplicity. The blue and white tile Swedish stove in the vestibule is paired with a blue and white painted reproduction, which is a wooden cupboard. The salon is decorated with handpainted 18th-century Chinese wallpaper and gilded rococo mirrors. The master bedroom is furnished with pale gray Gustavian chairs covered in green-and-white checked cotton, very similar to the reproductions that Ikea once sold in its Swedish collection. This charming villa would not be out of place in most small towns in America.</p>
        <p>The genius of Harleman (1700-1753) evidenced itself early. His father, the royal gardener, died when he was 7. ''His mother must have been a brilliant woman with a strong will,'' Mr. Sjoberg said. ''Carl was one of six small children she was left with, but she recognized his talents early on.''</p>
        <p>In 1721, on the recommendation of the royal architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, Harleman received a stipend to study art and architecture abroad. He visited the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Italy before settling in Paris for four years. There, he won the first prize for architecture in his class, at age 25.</p>
        <p>He was in Venice in 1727 when Tessin summoned him to decorate the royal palace. The rebuilding was about to resume after a 20-year hiatus caused by the costly wars waged by the romantic warrior King Carl XII. Harleman rushed home. Three months later, Tessin died and his son Carl Gustav was named commissioner of public buildings. He kept Harleman, who then went to Paris to recruit artisans to do fancy rococo masonry, stucco work and carved paneling.</p>
        <p>''No architect has ever been so gifted,'' Mr. Olausson said. ''He did everything.'' The museum show includes his drawings for carved trophies for the walls, huge wrought-iron lanterns and fanciful rococo consoles.</p>
        <p>''He oversaw everyone who had anything to do with art and handicraft,'' Mr. Sjoberg said. ''Harleman has always been a name in Sweden, but no one knew how much he did because he never told anyone. Perhaps this exhibition will show how important he is in Sweden's architectural tradition.''</p>
