        <p>'A Global Collection of Art'</p>

        <p>West Village</p>
        <p>Through July 15</p>
        <p>The artist Claudia DeMonte, who teaches at the University of Maryland and has traveled widely, organized this show of many small works around a single sweeping idea: to ask one woman from every country in the world to contribute a single piece of art -- 8 by 8 inches in size -- addressing ''the experience of being a woman.''</p>
        <p>She researched her artists through various institutional channels, from local museums and embassies to the United States Navy and the Peace Corps. Queries to certain countries were unfruitful, but more than 170 produced work for the show, and they are all on view at White Columns, arranged alphabetically by country, beginning with Afghanistan and ending with Zimbabwe.</p>

        <p>'A Global Collection of Art'</p>

        <p>The artist Claudia DeMonte, who teaches at the University of Maryland and has traveled widely, organized this show of many small works around a single sweeping idea: to ask one woman from every country in the world to contribute a single piece of art -- 8 by 8 inches in size -- addressing ''the experience of being a woman.''</p>
        <p>She researched her artists through various institutional channels, from local museums and embassies to the United States Navy and the Peace Corps. Queries to certain countries were unfruitful, but more than 170 produced work for the show, and they are all on view at White Columns, arranged alphabetically by country, beginning with Afghanistan and ending with Zimbabwe.</p>
        <p>The media range from embroidery to digital photography. Traditional motifs and modernist abstraction sit side by side. Content is in some cases overtly polemical, in others lyrical and ornamental. In general, the pieces that stand out are those that operate most logically and cogently on a miniature scale.</p>
        <p>These include a red paper cutout of figures and birds by Yu Shi Xu of China; a collage image of a sleek high-heel shoe attached to a ball and chain by Worapanit Jiya-Amondej of Thailand; a swatch of decorative weaving from Laos, artist unknown; and an image of a pattern-intensive painting of an elaborately gowned woman by Yaznur Ovganova of Turkmenistan.</p>
        <p>Some of the other work is much less persuasive. But the show is less about the strengths or weaknesses of its individual parts than about the embracing humanistic impulse that brought them together, which Ms. DeMonte writes about with touching candor in the exhibition catalog. After the show has traveled, the work will be auctioned to benefit the New York Women's Foundation.</p>
