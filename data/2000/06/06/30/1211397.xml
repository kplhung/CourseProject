        <p>Vice President Al Gore called today for more federal spending on light rail transportation systems and on buses that use cleaner fuels, saying he would devote $25 billion over 10 years to improving mass transportation in states and cities, reducing air pollution and liberating Americans from too heavy a dependence on oil.</p>
        <p>He also said he wanted to liberate them from having to travel to work every day in the same old, tired, potentially expensive and possibly sluggish way. ''You deserve the independence to get in your car and drive anywhere you want to go, on your own schedule, without having to empty your wallet at every filling station,'' Mr. Gore said at a campaign event today in Chicago, against a backdrop of the skyline and Lake Michigan.</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore called today for more federal spending on light rail transportation systems and on buses that use cleaner fuels, saying he would devote $25 billion over 10 years to improving mass transportation in states and cities, reducing air pollution and liberating Americans from too heavy a dependence on oil.</p>
        <p>He also said he wanted to liberate them from having to travel to work every day in the same old, tired, potentially expensive and possibly sluggish way. ''You deserve the independence to get in your car and drive anywhere you want to go, on your own schedule, without having to empty your wallet at every filling station,'' Mr. Gore said at a campaign event today in Chicago, against a backdrop of the skyline and Lake Michigan.</p>
        <p>''You should also have the choice, if you want it, to park your car at the light rail station and be moved swiftly into a newly thriving downtown without having to worry about gridlock,'' he said, later adding, ''You can choose which transportation fits your own life on any hectic day.''</p>
        <p>The $25 billion that he pledged brought to about $148 billion the amount of money Mr. Gore has said the federal government should spend over 10 years to make everything from power plants to family sedans more fuel-efficient and less toxic to the environment. Mr. Gore outlined his plans over three days in three swing states -- Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois -- that he was tentatively scheduled to visit yet again next week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides said that the $25 billion would finance grants for which states, cities and local agencies could compete, and it would cover projects like the rehabilitation of neighborhoods near rail stations.</p>
        <p>And he made clear in a subsequent news conference that unlike President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970's he was not trying to browbeat Americans into parsimonious use of energy. He was, in an era of enormous budget surpluses, trying to use federal spending and mostly tax incentives to nudge Americans toward more fuel-efficient, environmentally sensitive living.</p>
        <p>''I reject the idea that in order to have a clean environment and reduce our dependence on foreign oil, we all have to put on hair shirts and turn off the air-conditioners and swelter inside and feel good that we're doing our duty for the environment,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>As for domestic oil, Mr. Gore said that its producers had a lot of explaining to do and that he had informed officials with the Federal Trade Commission that he wanted its hearings into the increase in gasoline prices to be open to the public. Mr. Gore proudly noted that since he called for those hearings last week, prices had begun to decline.</p>
