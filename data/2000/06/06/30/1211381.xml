      <abstract>
        <p>Cuban government is keeping Elian Gonzalez in the news and continuing public rallies in apparent attempt to tap into overwhelming support for boy's return to rekindle some of revolutionary ardor that has cooled in recent years and to restore appeal of Pres Fidel Castro (M)</p>

        <p>''At Last in the Fatherland!'' declared the front-page headline in the official newspaper, Granma, above pictures of Elian Gonzalez stepping off the plane and being swept up in a relative's arms, an emotional end to the seven-month custody battle that captivated Cuba.</p>

        <p>''At Last in the Fatherland!'' declared the front-page headline in the official newspaper, Granma, above pictures of Elian Gonzalez stepping off the plane and being swept up in a relative's arms, an emotional end to the seven-month custody battle that captivated Cuba.</p>
        <p>Despite the triumphal headline, the newspaper quickly reminded readers that the child's return was just the beginning of renewed efforts by Cuban officials who want to see an end to an American trade embargo. They contend that the embargo and other American policies weaken their economy and encourage people, like Elian's mother, to risk their lives at sea while seeking political asylum.</p>
        <p>For those reasons, the government plans to continue the public rallies and televised discussions that provided a political play-by-play during the Elian custody battle.</p>
        <p>Foreign officials based here see the continuing campaign as an attempt to tap into the Cuban public's overwhelming support for Elian's return in the hope of rekindling a revolutionary ardor that had cooled in recent years. They said the battle over Elian was the perfect opportunity for President Fidel Castro to restore his appeal.</p>
        <p>''He got himself front and center before the country on a daily basis,'' said one foreign official. ''He re-established himself in his image as the sole leader in Cuba who still has the oomph and fire to carry on the revolution. He got an issue he could mobilize the youth, who are his audience and a group that he had not had effective outreach to before.''</p>
        <p>It is not clear whether Mr. Castro  will be able to sustain his appeal. Some people said they had tired of the government-sponsored rallies for Elian and the televised talks about the ills of American society. Many said they simply wanted the boy home with his family.</p>
        <p>''Politics is politics,'' said Maria Gonzalez, who was shopping at a Havana market. ''Human feelings should not be mixed up with that.''</p>
        <p>Yet today's newspapers were filled not only with praise for Elian and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, but also for the youths who attended the countless public rallies organized by the government. While insisting the government would not trot out the child as a symbol, the official newspaper made clear Elian's importance to a battle that it said must continue ''immediately and without a truce.''</p>
        <p>''Ahead of us is the challenge that no new Elians continue to appear,'' one article said.</p>
        <p>Already, the huge billboards with Elian's face have been replaced by others that call for the United States to end its Cuban Adjustment Act, which grants political asylum to Cubans who reach American soil. But while the custody battle strongly affected many Cubans, the policy issues now being tackled may not have the same resonance.</p>
        <p>''Elian's story was so visual, with this child and his father,'' said one foreign official. ''Can you keep that up with the Cuban Adjustment Act without any such visuals? It will be difficult.''</p>
        <p>In the short term, diplomats said, the Cuban government has scored some points through its campaign for Elian's return. They pointed to the easing of restrictions on American food sales passed this week by the United States Congress. They said that decision was a result of a growing sentiment against the embargo in the United States among people who favored Elian's return and who were turned off by the hardball tactics of Elian's Miami relatives and their supporters who sought to keep him.</p>
        <p>''They noticed it was not just about a regime, but there were real people living in Cuba,'' one diplomat said. ''A lot of people in the United States questioned the embargo, and Elian helped with that sentiment.''</p>
