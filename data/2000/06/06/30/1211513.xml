        <p>The Talented Mr. Ripley</p>
        <p>Posing as a Princeton graduate, Tom Ripley (Matt Damon, left) goes abroad presumably to help persuade the dilettante Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) to return home. Once in Europe, though, Tom finds a world that a young man on the make could easily get used to. Ingratiating himself with Dickie, Tom becomes a part of his circle, but it gradually it occurs to him that, given his talents with impersonation, he could actually become Dickie. In a homoerotic Faustian bargain played for keeps, Anthony Minghella's film, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ''offers diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look.''</p>
        <p>1999. Paramount $107.37; DVD, $29.99. 139 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>

        <p>The Talented Mr. Ripley</p>

        <p>1999. Paramount $107.37; DVD, $29.99. 139 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>Hanging Up</p>
        <p>Three frazzled sisters do their best to keep up with their elderly father's deteriorating medical condition while staying connected to frantically busy lives via cordless telephone. Even the old man (Walter Matthau) is a mean hand with a touch-tone keypad, constantly harassing Eve (Meg Ryan), the dizziest of the sisters, from his hospital bed. Maddy (Lisa Kudrow) has a slumping soap opera career on her hands, while Georgia (Diane Keaton), a famous magazine editor, has a new publication to get off the ground. And with Dad to deal with, the film's ''very busyness ensures that the characters' feelings stay on the surface'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $107.37; DVD, $24.95. 95 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.</p>
        <p>Scream 3</p>
        <p>When we left Wes Craven's ''Scream 2,'' all knife-wielding maniacs supposedly had been sent to the sidelines. Now, though, someone with those familiar concave cheeks is slicing up people on a movie set. ''Ten more murders and we have a calendar,'' says a detective. The killer really wants Sidney (Neve Campbell), the combative student who gave him so much trouble in earlier ''Scream'' blood baths. Dewey (David Arquette), the sheriff's deputy, is back, as is the scoop-driven newswoman Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette), but Sidney is the target in a film that is ''as much a personality show as it is a slasher film'' (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>2000. Dimension. $112.18; DVD, $32.99. 116 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>Women</p>
        <p>It's a sorry excuse for cramming five personal stories into one movie, but here we have a television personality (Carmen Maura) preparing a documentary in which she asks her friends what they would do if they had three wishes. Never mind that Ms. Maura is a Pedro Almodovar favorite or that her friends include Miou-Miou, Marisa Berenson, Marthe Keller and Guesch Patti and that the film was shot in Portugal. Everybody has the 40-something jitters. Think ''Rohmer crossed with Almodovar, but on a much lower artistic plane'' (Holden).</p>
        <p>1998. Fox Lorber. $89.98; DVD, $29.98. 95 minutes. French with English subtitles. No rating.</p>
        <p>Keep in Mind</p>
        <p>While the big films of summer rule the box office, video usually makes more modest gains at this time of year. Here are some current best-renters.</p>
        <p>THE GREEN MILE. A retired prison guard (Tom Hanks) recalls a time of spiritual awakening in the 30's when he ran the security on death row at a prison. Frank Darabont's film is adapted from Stephen King's novel. 1999. Warner. $109.99; DVD, $24.98. 188 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>GIRL, INTERRUPTED. Sent to Claymoore psychiatric hospital, Susanna (Winona Ryder) falls in with the house insurgent (Angelina Jolie) and learns that her problems can be hung mainly on her neurotic peevishness and a need to grow up. 1999. Columbia Tri-Star. $107.37; DVD, $24.95. 127 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>BICENTENNIAL MAN. An industrial robot named Andrew (Robin Williams) is made of metal but the emotions run gooey for several generations while the gizmo with a heart finds the woman he loves. 1999. Touchstone. $104.16; DVD, $32.99. 131 minutes. Closed captioned. PG.</p>
        <p>PLAY IT TO THE BONE. Two burned-out middleweights (Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas) sign to fight in Las Vegas and relive their botched title shots while being driven across the desert by a woman (Lolita Davidovich). 1999. Touchstone. $104.16; DVD, $32.99. 124 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>MAN ON THE MOON. Currently a schizophrenic state trooper in ''Me, Myself and Irene,'' Jim Carrey was the comedian Andy Kaufman in Milos Forman's film. 1999. Universal. $107.37; DVD, $29.99. 118 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
