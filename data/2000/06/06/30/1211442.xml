        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's opinion in the Boy Scouts case (excerpts, June 29) combines the disgraced reasoning in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and the United States military's unworkable ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy.</p>
        <p>In Plessy, constitutionalizing segregation despite the 14th Amendment, the court said, ''in the nature of things,'' the amendment ''could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color.'' In Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote: ''The Boy Scouts asserts that it 'teaches that homosexual conduct is not morally straight' . . . We need not inquire further to determine the nature of the Boy Scouts' expression with respect to homosexuality.'' Why not? Undoubtedly, because ''in the nature of things,'' homosexual conduct cannot be morally straight. Yet Chief Justice Rehnquist then implies that the Boy Scouts might not have prevailed had James Dale just stayed in the closet.</p>
        <p>A decision drawn from a discredited constitutional concept and an unworkable Pentagon policy has produced a constitutional monument to the enduring power of bigotry in our culture.</p>
        <p>ROGER WILKINS  Washington, June 29, 2000</p>
