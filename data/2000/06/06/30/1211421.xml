        <p>Erick Strickland said yesterday that he was among the many people who scratched their heads in bewilderment at the Knicks' decision to trade for him during the National Basketball Association draft Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>Not a true point guard, not one to strengthen the Knicks on the offensive backboards and not an adequate replacement for Allan Houston or Latrell Sprewell should one of them be traded, Strickland did not quite understand the team's logic in acquiring him.</p>
        <p>''Never in a million years would I have thought that,'' Strickland said on a conference call yesterday, just moments before boarding a plane from Texas to New York. ''That was probably the last place, I would have thought.</p>
        <p>''But now that it's happened, I'm sure we can work it out somehow, and I don't mind the challenge. I look forward to coming to New York because that's my style. The Knicks portray a style I've played my whole career, and I enjoy that and look forward to that.''</p>
        <p>Actually, the Knicks, who gave the Dallas Mavericks John Wallace and their first-round draft pick, Donnell Harvey, for Strickland and Pete Mickeal, are hoping that Strickland, a burly 6-foot-3 guard, can change their style a bit. Reputed to be one of the league's toughest and most bullish teams, the Knicks know their reputation is a holdover from the years of Anthony Mason, Charles Oakley and John Starks. Their current lineup is not nearly as gritty as advertised.</p>
        <p>With Strickland, the Knicks believe they immediately become more physical. He is a strong rebounder and defender who takes charges. Offensively, he plays both guard positions but is more of a scorer than a passer. A streaky shooter, he can light up the arena one night and build a brick house in it the next.</p>
        <p>Last season he averaged career highs of 12.8 points, 4.8 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 29.8 minutes a game as a starter for the Mavericks. If Strickland sounds a lot like Starks, say hello to the Knicks' new version of the former Madison Square Garden favorite. If Strickland, 26, stays in New York, the spark plug role will be his.</p>
        <p>''I look at myself as that type of guy,'' said Strickland, who has spent four seasons in the N.B.A., all with Dallas. ''I would love to come in and fill that void. I don't think I have all the antics that Starks did. One thing that I'm going to bring is tremendous heart. I'm going to come with it every night, blood, sweat and tears. I'm about winning. Period.''</p>
        <p>Despite his ability, Strickland may create more questions than answers for the Knicks. Foremost among them: does his presence mean a guard will be traded?</p>
        <p>Not necessarily, said the Knicks' coach, Jeff Van Gundy. He does not think a backcourt of Charlie Ward, Allan Houston, Chris Childs and Strickland is too crowded. Van Gundy believes the Knicks were fortunate that Houston and Sprewell stayed healthy throughout last season, and he likes the insurance Strickland represents.</p>
        <p>Van Gundy also looks forward to practices that are more physical and more competitive, with Houston and Sprewell working harder because Strickland is guarding them. He also thinks the battle for minutes could lift his guards' quality of play.</p>
        <p>''People think there's a glut of guards that we have, but that's not really true,'' Van Gundy said. ''Charlie's the only true point we have, and Chris is a 1-2 like Strickland. Latrell is at small forward. Obviously, there will be a fight for minutes, but that's just how it is. Competition is good for a team.''</p>
        <p>If the Knicks have their way, the trade for Strickland will be the first of several off-season moves. Besides going after Grant Hill, a priority is improving at point guard, and if one of the incumbents has to go, they would prefer it to be Childs.</p>
        <p>Power forward is another concern. The Knicks hope to re-sign Kurt Thomas, who becomes a free agent tomorrow, but they know that may not be enough. Because they are over the salary cap, the Knicks have only the $2.25 million exception and the $1 million exception to spend in the free-agent market, so any upgrades will have to come via trades.</p>
        <p>''You can't take care of everything in one night and sometimes you can't take care of something at all,'' Van Gundy said. ''I believe that Scott Layden and his staff are going to work on it. We know we need to improve our offensive rebounding situation.''</p>
        <p>Strickland said he was glad to be joining a contender and hoped he was in the Knicks' long-term plans. He has three years left on a six-year, $14 million contract and said he planned to use his option to terminate the contract and become a free agent after next season. He believes the grand stage of New York City is the best place to advertise his ability.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt about that; what better place to do so?'' Strickland said. ''It's the biggest market and everybody and their mother wants to play in New York. So, what better place could I be?''</p>
