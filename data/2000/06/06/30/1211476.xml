        <p>Indictments handed up yesterday charged a Manhattan doctor with raping two tourists and charged a friend of his who is also a doctor with trying to throw the police off his trail.</p>
        <p>The doctor accused of rape, Selim Can Alkoc, a resident in psychiatry at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, fled to his native Turkey after the crime, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>The other doctor, Turker Sengul, who lives in the same building as Dr. Alkoc, is charged with hindering prosecution and tampering with evidence. After Dr. Alkoc fled the country, according to the indictment, Dr. Sengul carried his pager and collected his mail in an attempt to make law enforcement officials believe that he was still in New York.</p>
        <p>Dr. Alkoc met the women, both of whom were 21, in Canada and invited them to visit him and stay in his apartment at 515 West 59th Street, according to court papers.</p>
        <p>On May 23, several days after the women arrived, Dr. Alkoc drugged them with a sedative and raped and sodomized them, the indictment states.</p>
        <p>After the women filed complaints against Dr. Alkoc, Dr. Sengul helped him get clothes and tampered with some videotapes in Dr. Alkoc's apartment, an indictment states.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sengul told prosecutors he removed several videotapes that showed Dr. Alkoc in sexual encounters with women who appeared to be drugged, The Associated Press reported. The tapes were hidden under a bed and in a vacuum cleaner in Dr. Alkoc's apartment, according to The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>Dr. Alkoc's lawyer, Brian Perskin, said last night that his client had not fled but that he had simply gone home. The police interviewed Dr. Alkoc shortly after the women filed their complaint, Mr. Perskin said. Officers searched the doctor's apartment and removed his medicines and some other belongings, but they did not arrest him, Mr. Perskin said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perskin said the police told his client that if he did not hear from them in a few days, he should not worry. A few days later, Mr. Perskin said, St. Luke's suspended Dr. Alkoc without pay. Without an income, he decided to go home to Turkey, Mr. Perskin said.</p>
        <p>A hospital spokesman said both doctors were suspended because they were under investigation.</p>
        <p>''They knew where he was,'' Mr. Perskin said. ''They had a week and a half before he left,'' he said. ''Quite frankly, I can't imagine there being much evidence if he wasn't arrested right away.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Alkoc is charged with two counts of rape, two counts of sodomy, two counts of sexual abuse and one count of assault.</p>
