        <p>Asher &amp; Partners in Los Angeles has effectively resigned its California antismoking assignment after seven years, the agency said, by deciding against participating in a mandated review for the account that began last month. The assignment, typically for a five-year term, has an annual budget estimated at $25 million.</p>
        <p>Barry Schoenfeld, partner and business development director at Asher, attributed the decision to philosophical differences with the Tobacco Control Section of the California Department of Health Services, which administers the anti smoking account. The humorous, award-winning campaign the agency has created is known for ads that show smoking cowboys complaining about health problems.</p>

The humorous, award-winning campaign the agency has created is known for ads that show smoking cowboys complaining about health problems.</p>
        <p>''People are tired of ads bashing the tobacco industry, bashing smokers,'' Mr. Schoenfeld said. ''We wanted to get back to the roots of the program, prevention and cessation.''</p>
        <p>Though the account is the second major loss for the agency, coming after its Suzuki automotive assignment was shifted to the Colby Effler &amp; Partners unit of Dentsu in Santa Monica, Calif., there will be no layoffs, Mr. Schoenfeld said.</p>
