        <p>All of the United States' selected crews, the Henley Royal Regatta's version of seeding, advanced yesterday on the second day of competition in the Temple Challenge Cup for eight-oared crews at Henley-on-Thames, England.</p>
        <p>Columbia, Yale, Brown and Rutgers were victorious in their heats of the Temple Cup, with Columbia's chief opposition, London's Imperial College, having to stop rowing when it lost its steering mechanism midway through the course.</p>
        <p>Columbia and Yale have been trading victories this year, and should they both get through their heats today, they will meet in tomorrow's quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>The only American loss in the Temple Cup came when the University of Virginia heavyweight varsity finished one and a half boat lengths behind England's Nottingham University.</p>
        <p>Columbia's entry in the Visitors' Challenge Cup for coxless fours fell victim to errant steering, hitting buoys at the start of the course and eliminating itself.</p>
