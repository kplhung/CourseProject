        <p>The macho, conservative world of Mexican politics has finally begun to show off its more feminine side as political parties battle as never before to win the votes of women.</p>
        <p>Male strippers were hired to perform at one campaign rally. Television advertisements raised questions about candidates' relationships with their former wives, a subject long considered taboo for public discussion. And while the participation of candidates' families is common in the United States, the high-profile roles of political wives and daughters  in Mexico this year has signaled a new opening for women and women's issues in government.</p>
        <p>Because of their numbers, women have been strongly courted by political candidates in Mexico since they gained the vote in 1953. But in Sunday's presidential election -- currently a statistical dead heat between the governing party candidate, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, and the center-right opponent, Vicente Fox Quesada -- women's votes may be decisive.</p>
        <p>Some 52 percent of the Mexican electorate are women; more than one-third of all voters are homemakers.</p>
        <p>Because of that power, the way the presidential candidates dress, speak and arrange their schedules, whether campaigning in urban centers or rural villages, is done to appeal to women.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the National Feminine Civic Association said that for the first time they had been invited to meetings with most presidential candidates to express their concerns about women.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox's penchant for bluejeans and cowboy boots may make him appear more down to earth among working men, but to many women they make him just plain sexy. And Mr. Labastida has turned to his wife, Maria Teresa Uriarte de Labastida, to help infuse warmth and color into his image.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Labastida is an expert on Mayan culture who moves as easily at indigenous ceremonies as she does among the Mexican elite. Pretty and poised, Mrs. Labastida often wraps her husband in bearhugs on stage and gladly complies when the crowds demand she give him a kiss. Her visibility and political self-assuredness have brought comparisons to Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>And it seems that Mrs. Labastida shares the same instinct for political combat. At a recent rally of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, for women at the National Auditorium, it was Mrs. Labastida who criticized Mr. Fox for his occasional use of vulgar language, suggesting that he was not only a bad influence on children but also undeserving of public trust.</p>
        <p>Women like Eva Nely Duarte Ochoa, 43, a homemaker and mother of three from Michoacan, hung on every word. ''To see the party recognize the talents of women, for me, is proof that they understand our needs and that they are going to pay attention,'' she said. ''Women have always participated in all parts of society, but now we are being recognized for our contributions.''</p>
        <p>The efforts appear to have paid off for the PRI. While the most reliable final polls last week showed that the support for Mr. Labastida and Mr. Fox among voters in general was too close to call, they found that Mr. Labastida was slightly more popular among women.</p>
        <p>Homemakers, the largest segment of voters among women, have long been a bastion of support for the PRI, especially those who live in rural communities, have fewer years of education and hold more conservative beliefs. And it seems that support is holding.</p>
        <p>But women's strength no longer lies only in their numbers. There has also been evidence of a coming of age as women assume greater control in their homes and communities. According to the Mexican Association of Women Executives, more and more women have moved into the work force, with close to 40 percent of all Mexican women involved in some type of economic activity for the benefit of their families. Among workers, women have an average of 1.3 years more education than men. And more than 50 percent of all university students are women.</p>
        <p>Women tend to be more sensitive than men to how well the government fulfills its responsibilities, analysts say, and less afraid to express discontent. As homemakers, they are the ones who worry most about whether there is electricity, clean water, reliable transportation and good schools and hospitals. And in the workplace, they have become vocal advocates for fair wages and safe conditions.</p>
        <p>''Women more than any other group, except maybe young people, are the most active proponents for change,'' said Martha Sahagun, a spokeswoman for Mr. Fox. ''They are the most forceful fighters and to limit their importance to their numbers devalues their significance.''</p>
        <p>Margarita Elena Tapia, a candidate for the Mexico City Council of Delegates, considers her campaign the product of women's new political power. The left-wing Center Democratic Party asked her to be its candidate, she said, because of a commitment the party had made to feminist organizations and because the grass-roots organizations at work in the neighborhoods Ms. Tapia would represent are led by women.</p>
        <p>''Only a few women have served as governors or as cabinet members,'' she said, ''but smart politicians understand that their political bases are controlled by women.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Fox, the candidate of the opposition National Action Party, is elected, he will be the first unmarried president of Mexico in recent decades. Both he and Mr. Labastida are divorced, and Mr. Labastida has acknowledged fathering a child out of wedlock. But neither candidate seems to have suffered in popularity because of these matters.</p>
        <p>Women like Olga Lidia Colina Gonzalez, a factory worker, said she supported Mr. Fox because she liked what he did for women when he was  governor in her home state of Guanajuato. ''He told everybody that women's words are worth as much as men's'' Mrs. Gonzalez said. ''Before people used to use any bad language they wanted with me. Now, wherever I go, I get treated with respect.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Labastida has appeared to win more support among conservative women, it is generally Mr. Fox who espouses more traditional positions on women's and religious issues, especially abortion. A devout Catholic, he said he believes life begins at conception and therefore he personally opposes abortion.</p>
        <p>Early in his campaign, Mr. Fox was criticized as being too macho, and even homophobic, by feminist groups when he spoke about his feelings against abortion and when his campaign ran advertisements questioning Mr. Labastida's masculinity.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Fox's pretty and articulate daughters -- two of the four children he adopted with his former wife -- drew on their own existence to soften Mr. Fox's position and blunt those attacks. In interviews with reporters, the daughters talked about how fortunate they felt that their biological mothers decided against abortion. ''Just look at us,'' said Paulina Fox, a 17-year-old who won second place in a national public-speaking competition. ''Why would you end the life of someone when there are parents looking for children to care for and make happy.''</p>
        <p>Since then, Mr. Fox has gained ground among women, and most of it comes from the educated, urban, working women who would be expected to be against him.</p>
        <p>According to a June 5 poll in the newspaper Reforma, he beat Mr. Labastida among professionals older and younger than 40, among office workers in the private sector, among general workers in public and private agencies, and among students.</p>
        <p>''His position on abortion was the only thing that made me uncomfortable,'' said Telia Cervantes Gutierrez, a 24-year-old law student. ''But when you see his daughters at his side, you know that he really believes it when he says there are alternatives to abortion.''</p>
        <p>At a Fox rally last Saturday in Mexico City's main plaza, Ms. Cervantes stood next to her mother, Evelia Garduno, 40, a homemaker who said she had decided to vote against the PRI for the first time.</p>
        <p>It used to be, Ms. Garduno said, that she was afraid to vote for change. Now, she said, change seemed the best hope for the future of her children. ''For years we have waited for better houses, better schools, better jobs,'' she said. ''I do not want to wait anymore.''</p>
