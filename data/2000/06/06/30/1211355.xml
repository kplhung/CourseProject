        <p>Bond yields fell sharply yesterday amid weakness in stocks and investor relief that the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>In the currency market, the dollar was off against the euro and the yen, making dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors because of exchange-rate advantages.</p>
        <p>The price of the 10-year Treasury note, which many market participants are using as the benchmark, rose 1 6/32, to 103 14/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.02 percent from 6.10 percent on Wednesday. The price of the 30-year bond rose 1 5/32, to 105 10/32. Its yield dropped to 5.87 percent from 5.95 percent.</p>
        <p>Robert Pugliese, director of the fixed-income department at the J. W. Genesis Financial Corporation, said the moves were exaggerated by low liquidity and volume in the market.</p>
        <p>He says that Treasury prices are too lofty, with the price of a 10-year note having run up too fast, and that more interest rate increases by the Fed are in the offing. ''I don't see prices remaining at these high levels,'' he said. ''Prices in bonds and equities will decline. The economic slowdown is a head fake, so there are more tightenings in the wings.''</p>
        <p>Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the Federal Open Market Committee, at its meeting on Wednesday, refrained from tightening again ''as more moderate economic and inflation data suggested that the previous tightenings instituted over the past year may finally be starting to lower the trend rate of economic growth to a more sustainable level, while at the same time keeping a lid on rising price pressures.''</p>
        <p>''But the issues of sustainability and extent of any slowdown are open questions at this juncture,'' he added, ''and further Fed tightening at the August F.O.M.C. meeting seems probable in light of the economy's still-buoyant forward momentum, tight labor markets and continued upcreep in inflation.''</p>
        <p>The government securities market was bolstered by the Treasury's buyback program, some end-of-the-quarter buying and softer new-home sales data that ran counter to sales figures released earlier this week.</p>
        <p>The release yesterday of updated figures for first-quarter gross domestic product caused few surprises. Some bond market participants think coming figures on consumer prices could prove unnerving, particularly if components of the price index outside of energy go up more than expected.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fine is among those paying closer heed to other coming reports.</p>
        <p>''The bond market's next major hurdle,'' Mr. Fine said, ''will be the June labor market report, which should correct any misleading perceptions resulting from last month's presumably questionable information, which showed extraordinary weakness in the midst of a very tight labor market.''</p>
