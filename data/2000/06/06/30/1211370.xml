        <p>Shares in Priceline.com dropped 8.4 percent yesterday after a report that six major airlines planned to invest in a competing Web site for customers looking for discounts on plane tickets online.</p>
        <p>The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that UAL's United Airlines, AMR's American Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Continental Airlines, US Airways and America West Airlines had invested in Hotwire.com, a San Francisco start-up scheduled to begin operating this fall.

        <p>Shares in Priceline.com dropped 8.4 percent yesterday after a report that six major airlines planned to invest in a competing Web site for customers looking for discounts on plane tickets online.</p>
        <p>The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that UAL's United Airlines, AMR's American Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Continental Airlines, US Airways and America West Airlines had invested in Hotwire.com, a San Francisco start-up scheduled to begin operating this fall. Hotwire has $75 million in financing, primarily from the Texas Pacific Group, a private investment firm that has owned stakes in Continental and America West.</p>
        <p>Priceline shares closed at $36.8125 each, down $3.375, in Nasdaq trading. The stock is down 69 percent from its 52-week high of $119.</p>
        <p>Isakowitz Tomas, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, cut the stock from a ''buy'' recommendation to ''accumulate,'' citing continuing concern about the valuation as well as the impending competition from Hotwire. Other analysts said the market had overreacted. Eighteen of the 19 analysts following the stock still rate it either a ''buy'' or ''strong buy.''</p>
        <p>''Investors still haven't learned that just having some cash, some partners and a press release does not make a leader,'' said Lauren Levitan, an analyst with Robertson Stephens. ''What makes a leader is getting out there and executing on a business plan day after day. Priceline is two years old, on the verge of break-even or profitability, and we do have ample evidence of their executional capability.''</p>
        <p>Like Priceline, Hotwire will sell so-called distressed inventory, seats that would otherwise go empty and that are not published on industry-wide sites like Travelocity.com and Expedia.com. Unlike Priceline, which requires users to bid for seats and accept the lowest fare offered, Hotwire will let them select an actual fare for the desired route. As with Priceline, the identity of the carrier, and the precise timing and routing, whether nonstop, or connecting, will be concealed until purchase.</p>
        <p>One big risk for Hotwire is that if it makes the process too easy, it could undercut the airlines' sales of full-fare tickets to business travelers, which are the source of most of their profits. Because Priceline makes the consumer go through various hurdles to get a discounted seat, it has reduced that risk for the carriers. Although only Delta Air Lines was on board when Priceline began, United, American and US Airways all joined in December and have minority equity stakes in the company.</p>
        <p>The airlines have already banded together in a fare site for leisure travelers, Orbitz.com, which is also scheduled to begin this fall. Delta, United, Northwest, Continental and American will take part in Orbitz, which is expected to offer fares similar to the deep discount tickets available on the airlines' own sites.</p>
        <p>Priceline said it expected no negative impact from Hotwire, and noted that its airline service had grown sharply in recent weeks. All eight major full-service United States airlines now work with Priceline, as well as over 20 brand-name international carriers. Priceline now sells more than 80,000 tickets a week.</p>
