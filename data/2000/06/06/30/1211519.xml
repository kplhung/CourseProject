        <p>Thrilling is the word for the performance that Amanda McKerrow and Jose Manuel Carreno offered in Natalia Makarova's staging of ''La Bayadere'' with American Ballet Theater on Wednesday night at the Metropolitan Opera House. Marius Petipa's epic ballet about love, intrigue and spiritual redemption in the India of the 19th-century imagination spoke forcefully through this performance, eloquently and intelligently put across by its principals.</p>
        <p>Ms. McKerrow has long found her natural center in the role of Nikiya, the betrayed temple dancer. Now she has added layers of dramatic projection to the combination of stylistic purity and musical climax she brings so happily to her classical dancing here. She and Mr. Carreno never let us forget that for all its melodramatic mime, ''Bayadere'' is above all a classical ballet dependent upon perfect academic form.</p>

        <p>Thrilling is the word for the performance that Amanda McKerrow and Jose Manuel Carreno offered in Natalia Makarova's staging of ''La Bayadere'' with American Ballet Theater on Wednesday night at the Metropolitan Opera House. Marius Petipa's epic ballet about love, intrigue and spiritual redemption in the India of the 19th-century imagination spoke forcefully through this performance, eloquently and intelligently put across by its principals.</p>
        <p>Ms. McKerrow has long found her natural center in the role of Nikiya, the betrayed temple dancer. Now she has added layers of dramatic projection to the combination of stylistic purity and musical climax she brings so happily to her classical dancing here. She and Mr. Carreno never let us forget that for all its melodramatic mime, ''Bayadere'' is above all a classical ballet dependent upon perfect academic form.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carreno as Solor, the warrior who leaves Nikiya to marry Gamzatti, the rajah's daughter, plumbs his role with depth and brilliance. He was a sensitive hero, troubled but commanding.</p>
        <p>In the classical choreography of the betrothal scene, his partnering of Oksana Konobeyeva, making her debut as Gamzatti, was secure and gallant. His solo here had the silken noble line that he expanded into more flamboyant exciting virtuosity (five double-assemble turns) in the Shades scene of Act II.</p>
        <p>In that world of the spirits, Ms. McKerrow moved from a persuasive dramatic heroine in Act I to the harmony of pure dance, expressive in itself. Virtuosic in her turns, charming in her skimming on toe, she was a poetic ghost.</p>
        <p>Ms. Konobeyeva did well for a first time in a role that involves strong technique and acting. The technique was inconsistent but her Gamzatti was gracious, even sedate.</p>
        <p>Yet she was very much part of the drama that erupted in Act III when Ms. McKerrow so sharply disrupted the wedding scene. As the jealous priest, Brian Reeder was nicely coherent in his mime. Here was a still-young villain, passionate in both love and hate. David Lamarche conducted.</p>
