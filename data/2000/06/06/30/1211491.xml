        <p>Through July 14</p>
        <p>A sixth-generation native of the Mississippi Delta country, Maude Schuyler Clay turned from the color photography that had been her mode to capture the look of her local landscape in black-and-white. She focuses on the flatlands themselves, their trees, bayous, old buildings and abandoned plantations -- enlivened by an occasional dog -- rather than the people and impoverished communities already documented by other photographers. And the results are often striking.</p>
        <p>The photographs are quite traditional, as befits their subject, and many have a haunting, elegiac quality. White, timeworn churches are a favorite subject, as in ''Church and Tree, Choctaw, Washington County,'' in which a prim old house of worship, standing in isolation, is played off against the free-form tree beside it. ''Cotton Field Church, Mattson, Mississippi,'' depicts a spired church sitting on its dignity across a scraggly field of cotton.</p>

        <p>A sixth-generation native of the Mississippi Delta country, Maude Schuyler Clay turned from the color photography that had been her mode to capture the look of her local landscape in black-and-white. She focuses on the flatlands themselves, their trees, bayous, old buildings and abandoned plantations -- enlivened by an occasional dog -- rather than the people and impoverished communities already documented by other photographers.

        <p>The photographs are quite traditional, as befits their subject, and many have a haunting, elegiac quality. White, timeworn churches are a favorite subject, as in ''Church and Tree, Choctaw, Washington County,'' in which a prim old house of worship, standing in isolation, is played off against the free-form tree beside it. ''Cotton Field Church, Mattson, Mississippi,'' depicts a spired church sitting on its dignity across a scraggly field of cotton.</p>
        <p>Other manmade structures are fading presences. ''Fitzgerald House, Albin, Tallahatchie County, Mississippi,'' a once-fancy abandoned dwelling, is a mere shadow of itself amid its surrounding trees and overgrowth. ''Pool, Mayfair Plantation, Sunflower County'' sits weedy and deserted in a dead landscape.</p>
        <p>Ms. Clay is also enamored of the way water seeps through the land in the form of creeks, bayous and swamps. In ''Dog on a Log, Tallahatchie County, Mississippi,'' a dog is the sole explorer of a swamp that stretches as far as the eye can see.</p>
        <p>For finding the poetry in this slow, languorous countryscape, Ms. Clay deserves much credit.</p>
