        <p>Before heading to the White House to brief President Clinton on her visit to the Middle East, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today that the administration did not feel pressed to immediately call a summit meeting between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright said that there ''was plenty of time to do what needs to be done'' and that ''our calculus is January 20,'' the day Mr. Clinton leaves office.</p>
        <p>Returning to the capital after meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, in Jerusalem and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, at Ramallah on the West Bank, Dr. Albright signaled that the time was not right for a summit meeting next week, a schedule that the Israelis have been eager for.</p>
        <p>Administration officials have consistently said the president would determine after Dr. Albright's visit whether the time was right for a summit meeting or whether it would be preferable to continue negotiations at a lower level to massage the issues that have divided the two sides for five decades.</p>
        <p>The Israelis have said they are ready for a three-way meeting with Mr. Clinton and Mr. Arafat in the Washington area next week to settle the final issues of the future of Jerusalem, the borders of a Palestinian entity and the fate of the scattered Palestinian refugees.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Albright, speaking to reporters on her airplane after a brief stop in Berlin, said there needed to be thorough preparation on the core issues before the leaders could be closeted in an isolated retreat. Otherwise, there was the risk of unnecessary failure.</p>
        <p>''There are certain issues that are the type of issues where if they are not properly prepared, then you are asking for something to be even more difficult,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In a series of talks between senior negotiators, solutions to the basic issues have been discussed in deep detail. A senior administration official said that those subjects had been ''de-mythologized'' and that some gaps had been narrowed.</p>
        <p>On the West Bank after her visit with Mr. Arafat, a senior Palestinian official, Saeb Ereket, said that teams of negotiators would return to Washington next week to talk for two more weeks and that a summit meeting was out of the question until after that.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said that a summit meeting at any time was a gamble but that Mr. Clinton was prepared to take the risk.</p>
        <p>From the Israeli side, a broad picture has emerged of what a final deal might look like. According to the Israeli accounts, it would include granting more than 90 percent of the West Bank for what would constitute, with the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian entity.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Arafat has stuck to his demands for a full withdrawal by Israel to the borders before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. In private, however, he was more flexible, realizing that some Israeli settlements would remain in the West Bank, administration officials said.</p>
