        <p>Ken Johnson reviews Deborah Butterfield's sculptures at Edward Thorp gallery (S)</p>

        <p>Edward Thorp</p>
        <p>210 Eleventh Avenue, near 25th Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through July 28</p>
        <p>Deborah Butterfield has been making essentially the same sculpture over and over for 25 years. Using pieces of found wood or metal, she glues together a construction that reads at once as raw stuff, gestural (or Cubist) abstraction and a remarkably lifelike image of a horse. It may be formulaic, but Ms. Butterfield, who lives in Montana and knows horses intimately, does it very well.</p>
        <p>In this show of two life-size and four half-size horse sculptures, however, another factor diminishes the effect of the work. Each of the horses appears to be made of pieces of weathered branches or roots. Some are made of wide, grainy serpentine pieces that are like giant brushstrokes; others are constructed from squiggly forms that create the impression of drawing in space. It is with a certain disappointment,  then, that one discovers that the sculptures are made not of wood, but of cast and craftily patinated bronze.</p>

        <p>The bronze gives the work a substance, weight and durability that will appeal, no doubt, to collectors; but it undoes the tension between the actuality of the wood and the animated equine illusion. Cast in bronze, Ms. Butterfield's sculptures ring false -- materially luxurious but aesthetically enervated simulations of the original constructions.</p>
