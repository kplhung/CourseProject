      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Alaska Airlines has allowed mechanics to perform work for which they were not qualified, skipped maintenance on test equipment and failed to tell pilots when equipment was inoperable, the Federal Aviation Administration said today.</p>
        <p>But the agency also said it had accepted the airline's remedial plan and would not shut down its maintenance operation, as officials had threatened.</p>
        <p>At the same time, a top F.A.A. official faulted his agency's performance in overseeing Alaska Airlines before the crash of one of its MD-80 jets in January, and said that F.A.A. inspectors would begin special audits of the nation's nine other large carriers in the next few days, to look for similar management problems.</p>
        <p>The official, L. Nick Lacey, the acting director of the Flight Standards Service, said the problem at Alaska Airlines was not simply the specific flaws found, but the pattern of errors and the failure to correct them.</p>
        <p>''Often there are lapses and oversights and mistakes, that type of thing,'' Mr. Lacey said, shortly after notifying the airline, based in Seattle, that it could continue operating.</p>
        <p>''What you're seeing here is going beyond that,'' he said, ''is going to the heart of why are these things happening, why are these noncompliances slipping through the system, why are these continuing over a long period of time.''</p>
        <p>Alaska Airlines, a unit of Alaska Air Group, has promised to hire an additional 130 maintenance and engineering workers, including many supervisors, and 28 more people for its flight operations department. It has also filled some long-vacant executive positions, including director of maintenance, a post that was open for nearly two years. Mr. Lacey criticized the failure to fill that job quickly, but said that his agency might have been partly at fault.</p>
        <p>''The issue is, Did we allow them not to fill it?'' he said, adding that he was ''disturbed'' by the agency's performance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lacey hinted, nonetheless, that the F.A.A. would seek a large fine against the airline for its failings.</p>
        <p>In fact, some of the findings were minor. The airline had installed enhanced medical kits in the rear overhead bins of its Boeing 737's but had not posted signs to show where the kits were. Other findings were more serious. The investigation found, for example, that the airline has a shortage of instructors to train pilots.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Lacey said today, ''what I never found in that report was unsafe airplanes in the air.''</p>
        <p>The crash that set off the F.A.A.'s investigation happened on Jan. 31, when an MD-80 jet trying to make an emergency landing in Los Angeles  plunged into the Pacific, killing all 88 people on board. The investigation has focused on the horizontal stabilizer, the movable portion of the horizontal tail that the pilots use to make the nose point up or down, but the National Transportation Safety Board, an independent agency, is still trying to determine the cause of the crash. The F.A.A. is assisting in that investigation, but Mr. Lacey would not talk about it today.</p>
        <p>The flaws found at the airline have not been tied directly to the crash. The situation is reminiscent of the aftermath of the crash of a Valujet Airlines DC-9 in the Florida Everglades in May 1996. After that crash, the F.A.A. conducted a ''white glove'' inspection of the airline and then shut it down, but for reasons that were unrelated to the crash.</p>
        <p>Such investigations often result, though, in criticism by the safety board of the F.A.A.'s program for monitoring airline safety.</p>
        <p>The inspection of the other airlines -- America West, American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, Southwest, TWA, United and US Airways -- is an unusual effort to identify management problems. ''This is not a traditional inspection when we're out there on the ramp, running around and tire-kicking,'' Mr. Lacey said.</p>
        <p>It is also intended to identify good practices that can be used at other airlines, he said, including the use of statistical systems to find troublesome parts that require more frequent maintenance.</p>
        <p>Inspectors would repeatedly re-visit Alaska Airlines to see if it was carrying out its improvement plan, Mr. Lacey said.</p>
