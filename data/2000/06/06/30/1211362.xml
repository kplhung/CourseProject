        <p>In a final day of housekeeping after concluding its term, the Supreme Court agreed today to settle a longstanding and increasingly bitter boundary dispute between New Hampshire and Maine about which state includes the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.</p>
        <p>The shipyard, a federal installation, sits on islands in the Piscataqua River, which flows into Portsmouth Harbor and forms the state boundary between Portsmouth, N.H., and Kittery, Me. According to Maine, the state boundary is in the middle of the channel, placing the shipyard on the Maine side. Consequently, Maine has been imposing its income tax on the people who work at the shipyard.</p>
        <p>New Hampshire, asserting a historical claim to all the river up to the shoreline on the Maine side, says the shipyard is in New Hampshire, which has no income tax.</p>
        <p>The United States owns the property in dispute, having begun in 1800 to acquire the five islands that make up the shipyard. For years, however, the Navy regarded the island as within New Hampshire's political jurisdiction. More recently, it has moved to an official position of neutrality, though the federal government has been withholding Maine income tax from the workers' paychecks.</p>
        <p>In March, New Hampshire filed its case against Maine directly in the Supreme Court, invoking the court's constitutional ''original'' jurisdiction to hear suits between states. In agreeing today to take jurisdiction of the case, the justices instructed the federal government to file a brief and make its views known.</p>
        <p>The case, New Hampshire v. Maine, No. 130 Original, is reminiscent of the ''original'' case the court heard two years ago between New York and New Jersey about which could claim Ellis Island. New Jersey emerged the winner.</p>
        <p>The competing claims of New Hampshire and Maine date to the colonial period. New Hampshire says it is significant that the Port of Piscataqua, now Portsmouth Harbor, was excluded from the Massachusetts Bay colony in 1691. What is now Maine was originally part of Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>For its part, Maine cites a decree signed in 1740 by King George II, setting the boundary as a line that ''shall pass up thro' the mouth of Piscataqua Harbour and up the middle of the river.''</p>
        <p>In its brief asking the court to hear its case, New Hampshire said that the shipyard ''has always been culturally, economically and politically connected to New Hampshire.'' The state ''is not able to maintain its historic connections to the shipyard without judicial assistance,'' New Hampshire said.</p>
        <p>The justices are likely to appoint a special master to hear evidence in the case and make a recommendation.</p>
        <p>As the court began its summer recess, it took these other actions today.</p>
        <p>Drug Sentencing</p>
        <p>The court vacated a Denver man's 30-year sentence for distributing cocaine and instructed the federal appeals court in Denver to reconsider the sentence in light of the Supreme Court ruling this week that the sentencing provision of New Jersey's hate-crime law was unconstitutional. The court's action today in Jones v. United States, No. 99-8176, could portend a major upheaval in federal drug sentencing.</p>
        <p>In its ruling on Monday in the New Jersey case, Apprendi v. New Jersey, the court held that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum had to be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The New Jersey law was unconstitutional because the judge, not the jury, determined after the defendant's conviction whether the crime had been motivated by bias, a finding that under the hate-crime law then resulted in an increased sentence.</p>
        <p>The drug sentence the court vacated today in light of that ruling was typical of the way drug sentencing works in the federal system. Carless Jones was indicted on and convicted by a jury of two counts of distributing cocaine, a crime that carries a statutory penalty of 20 years.</p>
        <p>The indictment did not specify a particular amount of cocaine, and the jury made no finding on that question. The presentence report informed the judge that the quantity of the drug, 165.5 grams, was enough for a life sentence. Over the defendant's objection, the judge imposed a sentence of 30 years on each count, to run concurrently. The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld the sentence, ruling that the jury had found all the necessary elements of the offense, and that the judge could make the findings necessary to determine the sentence.</p>
        <p>Abortion</p>
        <p>Following its invalidation on Wednesday of a Nebraska abortion law, the court vacated rulings by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, that upheld similar laws in Illinois (Hope Clinic v. Ryan, No. 99-1152) and Wisconsin (Planned Parenthood v. Doyle, No. 99-1156). The court also turned down an appeal by Iowa from a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which struck down that state's so-called partial-birth abortion law last year at the same time it invalidated the Nebraska law. (Miller v. Planned Parenthood, No. 99-1112).</p>
