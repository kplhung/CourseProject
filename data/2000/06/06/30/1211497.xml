        <p>The shoe designer Steven Madden pleaded not guilty yesterday to federal securities fraud charges that he helped manipulate 22 initial public offerings, including that of his own company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Madden, 42, entered his plea during a brief hearing in Manhattan federal court, and the case was assigned to Judge Kimba Wood of United States District Court. Mr. Madden also faces related criminal charges in Brooklyn federal court and a civil suit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission that seeks to bar him from heading any public company, including his own.</p>
        <p>Mr. Madden was arrested on the charges last week. His company, Steven Madden Ltd., said he would continue as chief executive but would temporarily give up his role as chairman.</p>
        <p>The cases involve I.P.O.'s underwritten by defunct broker-dealers Stratton Oakmont and spinoff Monroe Parker Securities between 1991 and 1997. Federal authorities say that Stratton Oakmont and Monroe Parker conspired with Mr. Madden to inflate the prices of new stock issues, sell ''locked up'' I.P.O. shares and conceal their illegal dealings.</p>
        <p>Principals of the two brokerage firms pleaded guilty last year to securities fraud and other charges.</p>
