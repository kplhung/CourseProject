        <p>The great harvest of songcraft that was MPB -- Musica Popular Brasileira, or Brazilian popular music, the catchall term for the work of the country's most urbane singer-songwriters from the 1960's to the 80's -- has one major limitation.  These great songs are products of single imaginations or, sometimes, small consortiums of songwriters.  And by the normal practice of the Brazilian pop music business, singer-songwriters tend to be somewhat disembodied from working bands.</p>
        <p>In Brazil there's not much distance between the best vernacular poets and the true men of letters. Indeed when the great figures of MPB perform alone onstage with a guitar, there's rarely a problem in any country; their brilliance is manifest. But when they come to the United States with bands, something gets lost in translation. The music can sound two or three decades out of date, and the poignancy of the songs can be lost in all but the voice singing them.</p>
        <p>Such, at times, was the case with Milton Nascimento during his performance at the Beacon Theater on Tuesday night. Mr. Nascimento, now in his late 50's, has gone through several phases in his career -- some staggeringly personal early work, some jazz-fusion and a more recent period of writing and interpreting very competent but somewhat formulaic pop songs. His set on Tuesday ran from 1970's ''Para Lennon e McCartney'' all the way to tracks from his latest album, ''Crooner'' (Warner Brothers Records).</p>
        <p>His old songs, many of which were written in partnership with composers like Fernando Brant, Ronaldo Bastos and Lo Borges, resist definition. They have patches of floating rubato amid rock, samba and Afro-Brazilian rhythms, and they jump between wildly different melodic strains. They mix advanced composition with folk roots; ''Calix Bento'' (''Blessed Chalice'') adapts a song performed by street groups in the state of Minas Gerais at Christmastime.</p>
        <p>They are harmonically complex, with vocal lines that go in unexpected trajectories within the chord progressions; the lyrics are often unrhymed and Mr. Nascimento sings them in a deep, relaxed voice that trembles in his long extensions of words. At times, in the student-resistance anthem ''Coracao de Estudante,'' for example, he entered a falsetto, not just as an extreme register to add a little color but also as a comfortable place to stay. His singing radiated vulnerability. And though he was far from his peak (Mr. Nascimento has recently been ill and still seems slightly frail), he has a formidable style.</p>
        <p>But his band sounded a little faceless at best, and with electric guitar and synthesizer it tended toward the dated, progressive jazz-rock of bands like Rush or Steely Dan. Mr. Nascimento's newer repertory doesn't have the natural strangeness of his early 70's songs; though the songs are still skillfully written, they are more sentimental. On the few occasions, however, when he sang with only guitar and drums to accompany him, the results were strong and moving.</p>
