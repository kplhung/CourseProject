        <p>The foreign minister of Canada and the secretary general of the Organization of American States urged President Alberto K. Fujimori today to remove his chief of intelligence as a crucial step in re-establishing a full democracy after last month's much-criticized presidential election.</p>
        <p>The proposal was one of several offered by the two officials, including ensuring the independence of the judiciary, guaranteeing access of the opposition to the media, establishing an independent human rights commission and returning a television network to an owner who was stripped of his property by the courts after critical news broadcasts.</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy of Canada and Secretary General Cesar Gaviria of the O.A.S. are heads of a three-day mission sent here by the regional organization after accusations of campaign irregularities and a questionable count of ballots in two rounds of presidential elections in April and May.</p>
        <p>The two officials stopped short of satisfying the opposition's demand for new elections, but its insistence that President Fujimori limit the powers of his intelligence services in the political process created some friction in meetings with senior officials.</p>
        <p>''This country has to put a limit on what the intelligence services can do,'' said Mr. Gaviria in an interview tonight, ''and put into better balance security and the rights of individuals.''</p>
        <p>Senior officials, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, said the two officials pressed Mr. Fujimori to remove Vladimiro Montesinos, his intelligence chief, from power as a necessary step to improve Peru's international standing. They said they had the explicit support of the Clinton administration in making the proposal, but they added that it was too early to gauge the Peruvian government's reaction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos is believed to have been the mastermind of a smear campaign of several presidential candidates in the tabloid press, as well as a campaign of harassment of opposition candidates and election observers. Though he was ousted as an army officer for suspected espionage in the 1970's, Mr. Montesinos has enormous influence over the military. He handpicked top army commanders in the months before the election and President Fujimori recently said he retains close communications with the Central Intelligence Agency and Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>
        <p>The Organization of American States mission told both the government and opposition that they must enter a dialogue to rebuild the judiciary, Congress and other democratic institutions. Alejandro Toledo, the opposition presidential candidate who charged fraud and dropped out of the race a week before the May 28 runoff, said he was ready to talk. A presidential commission appointed by Mr. Fujimori put out a statement today saying, ''The government accepts discussion of these themes with the political community and civil society.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Axworthy responded with cautious optimism tonight to the responses of both sides. ''It's not bad for the first day,'' he said in an interview. ''It took God seven days to create the world and we've been here only two.''</p>
        <p>The officials said a permanent Organization of American States mission will monitor and facilitate talks between the government and opposition and try to set timetables to guarantee results. One senior Canadian official, for instance, said officials had a goal to overhaul the government's election-counting apparatus by the 2002 municipal elections.</p>
        <p>But Peruvian officials publicly rejected any timetables. ''We are not going to establish a schedule, never,'' said Foreign Minister Fernando de Trazegnies.</p>
