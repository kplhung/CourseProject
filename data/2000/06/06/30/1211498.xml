        <p>The New York Life Insurance Company said yesterday that it was cooperating with federal authorities investigating charges that one of its bond traders received kickbacks in return for favorable bond prices.</p>
        <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States attorney's office for Manhattan were investigating whether Wall Street firms paid kickbacks or gave expensive gifts to Anthony Shen, a former New York Life trader.</p>
        <p>The government also is investigating whether more firms and traders are involved and whether fraudulent off-market trading occurred, whereby traders pay more or less than the quoted market price for a bond, the newspaper said.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for New York Life said the company was ''a victim of this scheme'' and was fully cooperating with regulatory and law enforcement authorities.</p>
        <p>A spokesman from the United States attorney's office would not comment when asked whether an inquiry was taking place.  The associate director of the S.E.C.'s division of enforcement in Washington, William Baker, was not available for comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shen was a portfolio manager at New York Life. His lawyer, Sean O'Shea, said Mr. Shen denied the charges.</p>
