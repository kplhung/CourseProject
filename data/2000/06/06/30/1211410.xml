      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Ralph Nader, in running for president as 'spoiler' candidate on Green Party ticket, is engaging in a self-indulgent exercise that will distract voters from clear-cut choice represented by major party candidates Vice Pres Al Gore and Gov George W Bush, and will particularly hurt Gore</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Ralph Nader's long history of public service championing the causes of consumers, the environment and economic justice automatically commands respect. But in running for president as the nominee of the Green Party, he is engaging in a self-indulgent exercise that will distract voters from the clear-cut choice represented by the major-party candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. His candidacy will be especially harmful for Mr. Gore, the contender closest to Mr. Nader on the environment and other issues. This political reality casts doubt on Mr. Nader's claim to be driven by policy differences rather than ego.</p>
        <p>We are equally reluctant to see the main election choices clouded by the spoiler candidacy of Patrick Buchanan on the Reform Party ticket, an effort that seems likely to pull votes from both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush. Of course, both Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Nader have the right to run. But given the major differences between the prospective Democratic and Republican nominees, there is no driving logic for a third-party candidacy this year, and the public deserves to see the major-party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field.</p>

        <p>Ralph Nader's long history of public service championing the causes of consumers, the environment and economic justice automatically commands respect. But in running for president as the nominee of the Green Party, he is engaging in a self-indulgent exercise that will distract voters from the clear-cut choice represented by the major-party candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. His candidacy will be especially harmful for Mr. Gore, the contender closest to Mr. Nader on the environment and other issues. This political reality casts doubt on Mr. Nader's claim to be driven by policy differences rather than ego.</p>
        <p>We are equally reluctant to see the main election choices clouded by the spoiler candidacy of Patrick Buchanan on the Reform Party ticket, an effort that seems likely to pull votes from both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush. Of course, both Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Nader have the right to run. But given the major differences between the prospective Democratic and Republican nominees, there is no driving logic for a third-party candidacy this year, and the public deserves to see the major-party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field.</p>
        <p>It is especially distressing to see Mr. Nader flirt with the spoiler role. For years, few Americans have made a more cogent critique of the Washington influence game and the abuses of corporate power. From his early attacks on automobile safety records to his most recent advocacy of campaign finance reform, he has elevated issues and sharpened Americans' awareness of flaws in their political system. Mr. Nader acknowledges that on his traditional issues, Mr. Gore would promise more  progress than Mr. Bush. But because he regards Mr. Gore as too much an incrementalist, Mr. Nader is saying in effect that he would choose outright defeat for the Democrats over small steps forward on those issues. That is a kind of irresponsibility that more befits a Ross Perot than someone with Mr. Nader's record and professed concerns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader may argue that he will force Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush to be more sensitive to election fund-raising reform and environmental issues. But the fact is that they have defined broad differences on these two issues without his help. The main economic issue that divides Mr. Nader from the major-party candidates is trade, and there, both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have positions that are better for the wage-earning voters that Mr. Nader claims to represent. For he and the Green Party are against all the recent trade agreements, including American membership in the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader clearly expects to use the trade issue to win votes from disenchanted union members and other workers. But protectionism runs counter to much of what Mr. Nader has fought for over the years. Foreign competition has been a factor in forcing the automobile industry to become more productive, fuel-efficient and profitable. There are also far more American workers whose jobs depend on exports, and whose families are able to buy less expensive goods imported from overseas, than there are those dislocated by trade.</p>
        <p>No doubt the last seven years under Mr. Clinton have been trying for liberals. Mr. Nader's opposition to the death penalty, his scathing critique of Democratic Party fund-raising and his willingness to embrace unorthodox positions like the gasoline tax may all have the effect of enlivening the public debate. But the only realistic role he can play this year is to tilt swing states like California in a conservative direction. Such an outcome would be contrary to the policy thrust of his career and add an unbecoming chapter to his legacy as a conscience-driven crusader.</p>
