        <p>Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's ruling today that the Boy Scouts of America can exclude gay members. The vote in the case, Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, was 5 to 4. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the decision; Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the dissent.</p>
        <p>FROM THE DECISION  By Chief Justice Rehnquist</p>
        <p>The forced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group infringes the group's freedom of expressive association if the presence of that person affects in a significant way the group's ability to advocate public or private viewpoints. But the freedom of expressive association, like many freedoms, is not absolute. We have held that the freedom could be overridden ''by regulations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.''</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's ruling today that the Boy Scouts of America can exclude gay members. The vote in the case, Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, was 5 to 4. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the decision; Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the dissent.</p>
        <p>FROM THE DECISION  By Chief Justice Rehnquist</p>
        <p>The forced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group infringes the group's freedom of expressive association if the presence of that person affects in a significant way the group's ability to advocate public or private viewpoints. But the freedom of expressive association, like many freedoms, is not absolute. We have held that the freedom could be overridden ''by regulations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.''</p>
        <p>To determine whether a group is protected by the First Amendment's expressive associational right, we must determine whether the group engages in ''expressive association.'' The First Amendment's protection of expressive association is not reserved for advocacy groups. But to come within its ambit, a group must engage in some form of expression, whether it be public or private. . . .</p>
        <p>The general mission of the Boy Scouts is clear: ''To instill values in young people.''  The Boy Scouts seeks to instill these values by having its adult leaders spend time with the youth members, instructing and engaging them in activities like camping, archery, and fishing. During the time spent with the youth members, the scoutmasters and assistant scoutmasters inculcate them with the Boy Scouts' values both expressly and by example. It seems indisputable that an association that seeks to transmit such a system of values engages in expressive activity. . . .</p>
        <p>The values the Boy Scouts seeks to instill are ''based on'' those listed in the scout oath and law. The Boy Scouts explains that the scout oath and law provide ''a positive moral code for living; they are a list of 'dos' rather than 'don'ts.' '' The Boy Scouts asserts that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with the values embodied in the scout oath and law, particularly with the values represented by the terms ''morally straight'' and ''clean.''</p>
        <p>Obviously, the scout oath and law do not expressly mention sexuality or sexual orientation. And the terms ''morally straight'' and ''clean'' are by no means self-defining.  Different people would attribute to those terms very different meanings. For example, some people may believe that engaging in homosexual conduct is not at odds with being ''morally straight'' and ''clean.'' And others may believe that engaging in homosexual conduct is contrary to being ''morally straight'' and ''clean.'' The Boy Scouts says it falls within the latter category.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey Supreme Court analyzed the Boy Scouts' beliefs and found that the ''exclusion of members solely on the basis of their sexual orientation is inconsistent with Boy Scouts' commitment to a diverse and 'representative' membership [and] contradicts Boy Scouts' overarching objective to reach 'all eligible youth.' '' The court concluded that the exclusion of members like Dale ''appears antithetical to the organization's goals and philosophy.'' But our cases reject this sort of inquiry; it is not the role of the courts to reject a group's expressed values because they disagree with those values or find them internally inconsistent.</p>
        <p>The Boy Scouts asserts that it ''teaches that homosexual conduct is not morally straight,'' and that it does ''not want to promote homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.'' We accept the Boy Scouts' assertion. We need not inquire further to determine the nature of the Boy Scouts' expression with respect to homosexuality. But because the record before us contains written evidence of the Boy Scouts' viewpoint, we look to it as instructive, if only on the question of the sincerity of the professed beliefs. . . .</p>
        <p>At least as of 1978, the year James Dale entered scouting, the official position of the Boy Scouts was that avowed homosexuals were not to be scoutleaders.</p>
        <p>A position statement promulgated by the Boy Scouts in 1991 (after Dale's membership was revoked but before this litigation was filed) also supports its current view:</p>
        <p>''We believe that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with the requirement in the scout oath that a scout be morally straight and in the scout law that a scout be clean in word and deed, and that homosexuals do not provide a desirable role model for Scouts.'' . . .</p>
        <p>As we give deference to an association's assertions regarding the nature of its expression, we must also give deference to an association's view of what would impair its expression. That is not to say that an expressive association can erect a shield against antidiscrimination laws simply by asserting that mere acceptance of a member from a particular group would impair its message.  But here Dale, by his own admission, is one of a group of gay scouts who have ''become leaders in their community and are open and honest about their sexual orientation.''  Dale was the copresident of a gay and lesbian organization at college and remains a gay rights activist. Dale's presence in the Boy Scouts would, at the very least, force the organization to send a message, both to the youth members and the world, that the Boy Scouts accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.</p>
        <p>''Hurley'' is illustrative on this point.  There we considered whether the application of Massachusetts's public accommodations law to require the organizers of a private St. Patrick's Day parade to include among the marchers an Irish American gay, lesbian and bisexual group, GLIB, violated the parade organizers' First Amendment rights. We noted that the parade organizers did not wish to exclude the GLIB members because of their sexual orientations, but because they wanted to march behind a GLIB banner. We observed:</p>
        <p>''A contingent marching behind the organization's banner would at least bear witness to the fact that some Irish are gay, lesbian, or bisexual, and the presence of the organized marchers would suggest their view that people of their sexual orientations have as much claim to unqualified social acceptance as heterosexuals. The parade's organizers may not believe these facts about Irish sexuality to be so, or they may object to unqualified social acceptance of gays and lesbians or have some other reason for wishing to keep GLIB's message out of the parade. But whatever the reason, it boils down to the choice of a speaker not to propound a particular point of view, and that choice is presumed to lie beyond the government's power to control.''</p>
        <p>Here, we have found that the Boy Scouts believes that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with the values it seeks to instill in its youth members; it will not ''promote homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.'' As the presence of GLIB in Boston's St. Patrick's Day parade would have interfered with the parade organizers' choice not to propound a particular point of view, the presence of Dale as an assistant scoutmaster would just as surely interfere with the Boy Scouts' choice not to propound a point of view contrary to its beliefs.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey Supreme Court determined that the Boy Scouts' ability to disseminate its message was not significantly affected by the forced inclusion of Dale as an assistant scoutmaster because of the following findings:</p>
        <p>''Boy Scout members do not associate for the purpose of disseminating the belief that homosexuality is immoral; Boy Scouts discourages its leaders from disseminating any views on sexual issues; and Boy Scouts includes sponsors and members who subscribe to different views in respect of homosexuality.''</p>
        <p>We disagree with the New Jersey Supreme Court's conclusion drawn from these findings.</p>
        <p>First, associations do not have to associate for the ''purpose'' of disseminating a certain message in order to be entitled to the protections of the First Amendment. An association must merely engage in expressive activity that could be impaired in order to be entitled to protection.</p>
        <p>Second, even if the Boy Scouts discourages scoutleaders from disseminating views on sexual issues, a fact that the Boy Scouts disputes with contrary evidence, the First Amendment protects the Boy Scouts' method of expression. If the Boy Scouts wishes scout leaders to avoid questions of sexuality and teach only by example, this fact does not negate the sincerity of its belief discussed above.</p>
        <p>Third, the First Amendment simply does not require that every member of a group agree on every issue in order for the group's policy to be ''expressive association.'' The Boy Scouts takes an official position with respect to homosexual conduct, and that is sufficient for First Amendment purposes. In this same vein, Dale makes much of the claim that the Boy Scouts does not revoke the membership of heterosexual scoutleaders that openly disagree with the Boy Scouts' policy on sexual orientation. But if this is true, it is irrelevant. The presence of an avowed homosexual and gay rights activist in an assistant scoutmaster's uniform sends a distinctly different message from the presence of a heterosexual assistant scoutmaster who is on record as disagreeing with Boy Scouts policy. The Boy Scouts has a First Amendment right to choose to send one message but not the other. The fact that the organization does not trumpet its views from the housetops, or that it tolerates dissent within its ranks, does not mean that its views receive no First Amendment protection. . . .</p>
        <p>We have already concluded that a state requirement that the Boy Scouts retain Dale as an assistant scoutmaster would significantly burden the organization's right to oppose or disfavor homosexual conduct. The state interests embodied in New Jersey's public accommodations law do not justify such a severe intrusion on the Boy Scouts' rights to freedom of expressive association.</p>
        <p>FROM THE DISSENT  By Justice Stevens</p>
        <p>New Jersey ''prides itself on judging each individual by his or her merits'' and on being ''in the vanguard in the fight to eradicate the cancer of unlawful discrimination of all types from our society.'' Since 1945, it has had a law against discrimination. The law broadly protects the opportunity of all persons to obtain the advantages and privileges ''of any place of public accommodation.'' . . .</p>
        <p>The majority holds that New Jersey's law violates B.S.A.'s [Boy Scouts of America's] right to associate and its right to free speech. But that law does not ''impose any serious burdens'' on B.S.A.'s ''collective effort on behalf of its shared goals,'' nor does it force B.S.A. to communicate any message that it does not wish to endorse. New Jersey's law, therefore, abridges no constitutional right of the Boy Scouts. . . .</p>
        <p>It is plain as the light of day that neither one of these principles, ''morally straight'' and ''clean,'' says the slightest thing about homosexuality. Indeed, neither term in the Boy Scouts' law and oath expresses any position whatsoever on sexual matters.</p>
        <p>B.S.A.'s published guidance on that topic underscores this point. Scouts, for example, are directed to receive their sex education at home or in school, but not from the organization. . . .</p>
        <p>B.S.A. never took any clear and unequivocal position on homosexuality. Though the 1991 and 1992 policies state one interpretation of ''morally straight'' and ''clean,'' the group's published definitions appearing in the Boy Scout and scoutmaster handbooks take quite another view. And B.S.A.'s broad religious tolerance combined with its declaration that sexual matters are not its ''proper area'' render its views on the issue equivocal at best and incoherent at worst. . . .</p>
        <p>B.S.A. has, at most, simply adopted an exclusionary membership policy and has no shared goal of disapproving of homosexuality. B.S.A.'s mission statement and federal charter say nothing on the matter; its official membership policy is silent; its scout oath and law and accompanying definitions are devoid of any view on the topic; its guidance for scouts and scoutmasters on sexuality declare that such matters are ''not construed to be scouting's proper area,'' but are the province of a scout's parents and pastor; and B.S.A.'s posture respecting religion tolerates a wide variety of views on the issue of homosexuality. . . .</p>
        <p>The only apparent explanation for the majority's holding, then, is that homosexuals are simply so different from the rest of society that their presence alone unlike any other individual's should be singled out for special First Amendment treatment.</p>
        <p>That such prejudices are still prevalent and that they have caused serious and tangible harm to countless members of the class New Jersey seeks to protect are established matters of fact that neither the Boy Scouts nor the court disputes. That harm can only be aggravated by the creation of a constitutional shield for a policy that is itself the product of a habitual way of thinking about strangers. As Justice Brandeis so wisely advised, ''we must be ever on our guard, lest we erect our prejudices into legal principles.''</p>
        <p>If we would guide by the light of reason, we must let our minds be bold. I respectfully dissent.</p>
