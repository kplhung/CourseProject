        <p>As the game stretched into its second overtime, the curses streaming out of the dusty men inside Clube Portugues Vasco da Gama on James Street grew more anguished.</p>
        <p>This was the point in the match at which men like these, almost all of them Portuguese immigrants, hands thick as hams and faces like creased leather, forgot about jobs, wives and children and began to pray for the 11 sweat-drenched players on the television, the pride of their nation: the Portuguese national soccer team.</p>
        <p>In a soccer stadium in Brussels, the Portuguese were battling the bigger, more experienced French in the semifinal match of this year's European Championship. Here in Bridgeport, home to the largest Portuguese community in Connecticut, about 200 men (and exactly 2 women) were staring at three televisions that were carrying the game live.</p>
        <p>''This is our Super Bowl,'' said Jaime Jorge, of Trumbull, a marketing executive for a national car-rental company who, like everyone else here today, took the afternoon off to come to Vasco da Gama, an 80-year-old soccer club with about 600 members. ''If you watch the game at home, you're not going to ride that roller coaster of emotion,'' said Mr. Jorge, who, at 31, was one of the youngest in the crowd.</p>
        <p>Raul Ribereiro, 52, an electrical contractor, said he had been coming to the club about five days a week since he arrived from Coimbra, Portugal, in 1982. ''This is the point where we all get together,'' he said, finishing off a pork-chop sandwich. ''We have this center and the church,'' Our Lady of Fatima, where priests still say Mass in Portuguese.</p>
        <p>More than 20,000 Portuguese or their descendants now live in and around Bridgeport, rivaling the two larger communities in Newark and in New Bedford, Mass. They began arriving in the first decades of the 20th century, mainly from the northern region near Chaves, and started new lives hauling in fishing nets, pounding railroad ties and punching timecards in Bridgeport's factories.</p>
        <p>The Vasco da Gama soccer club, like the 15th-century Portuguese explorer for whom it is named, is a point of reference and extreme pride for the men and women who gather here several nights a week and know one another by first name.</p>
        <p>The four-sided bar is made, they will tell you, of imported brown Portuguese marble. Two oblong glass cases on the wall are crammed with trophies, team photographs and banners from other Portuguese, Italian, Polish and German soccer clubs around the region.</p>
        <p>Joe Matos, 48, who normally spends Wednesday afternoons building swimming pools, had not missed a Portuguese game since the European Championship began last month. The team had surpassed expectations, winning all four of its matches thus far. Mr. Matos, who immigrated in 1967, said his boss had no choice but to let him and his colleagues take time off on game days.</p>
        <p>''We tell him, 'We got a soccer game, we gotta watch it,' '' Mr. Matos said, his hair, T-shirt and jeans coated with a fine layer of cement dust. ''He gets mad, but what's he gonna do? We've got five guys on the crew.''</p>
        <p>And the crew was here, watching the game. As the match progressed, the cigarette smoke hovering over the marble bar grew dense, the men more vociferous. Finally, in the 20th minute, a Portuguese striker rocketed a shot past the French goalkeeper, and Clube Vasco da Gama erupted with shouts of ''Golo!''</p>
        <p>''We're gonna win, 2 to 0,'' claimed Mr. Matos, smiling.</p>
        <p>But in the second half, the French, desperate to tie the game, began attacking the Portuguese goal, and the members of Clube Vasco da Gama, most of them standing up, grew agitated. ''Onde esta penalto?'' the older men would cry when a Portuguese player was tackled without a call from the Austrian referee. They bellowed curses when the French finally scored in the 52nd minute. But hope pulsed through everyone.</p>
        <p>If the team won, some of the younger men said, they planned to drive across town and wave the Portuguese flag in front of a social club for French people.</p>
        <p>As the second overtime wound down, the dusty members of Vasco da Gama twisted their bodies with every missed shot. The game finally slipped away when a Portuguese defender conceded a penalty shot. Seconds later on the field in Brussels, the French captain, Zinedine Zidane, kicked and scored, winning the game. Inside Vasco da Gama, men turned away or hung their heads in silent agony. A few began heated arguments over the referee's fatal call.</p>
        <p>Their prayers unanswered, the men's jobs, their wives and their families came zooming back into focus. Heading out into the sunny afternoon, many men talked with one another amiably, but with a noticeable air of having missed winning the state lottery by a single digit.</p>
        <p>''Take it easy,'' Mr. Matos, the swimming pool builder, told a visitor.  There was always the next game, the next tournament, the next chance for Portuguese soccer glory.</p>
