        <p>Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, has an unusual motivational tool for his rank and file: Let's go to the videotape!</p>
        <p>Girding for today's showdown on the House floor over a Republican-sponsored bill to expand Medicare coverage to include prescription drugs, Mr. Gephardt showed Democrats clips this week from ''Gladiator'' and ''Apollo 13'' to rouse his troops to fight together against the Republican legislation. Ultimately, however, the Republicans prevailed.</p>
        <p>At a meeting Tuesday of the 211 House Democrats, Mr. Gephardt dimmed the lights in a Capitol conference room and rolled the scene from ''Gladiator'' in which warriors led by the film's hero prepare to battle better-armed gladiators. (Subtext: The House Democrats are the underdogs; the Republicans are the evil gladiators, Democratic aides said.)</p>
        <p>In the part of the film viewed by the Democrats, Maximus, the hero, implores his men to fight with him and says, ''Whatever comes out of these gates, we have a better chance of survival if we stick together.'' When the underdogs win, the room full of Democrats burst into wild cheers and clapping, aides said. ''The point is, we need to stick together on this vote,'' one Democratic aide said.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Gephardt showed Democrats the clip from ''Apollo 13'' that includes the line, ''Failure is not an option.''</p>
        <p>This is not the first time Mr. Gephardt has used movie clips to rev up the minority. Last August, he showed Democrats a clip from ''Braveheart'' before the summer recess as part of Democrats' strategy to fight for more teachers. They won that fight, but their ''Gladiator''-inspired effort against the Republican Medicare legislation was much more of an uphill battle.</p>
