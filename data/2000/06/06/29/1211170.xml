        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>THE QUESTION OF INFLUENCE -- Critics of the influence of money in politics have long complained that the only real way to get a place at the table is to buy one, and Vice President Al Gore seemed to edge up on a similar assessment this week in his remarks to a mostly black crowd of first- and second-generation immigrants from Africa at a $1,000-per-person fund-raiser in Washington. Noting that the event raised $350,000 for the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Gore told the audience, ''That is a sign that this group has really entered a brand new relationship to the national politics of our country.'' He added that ''as Irish-Americans have been able to focus the attention of our policy makers,'' so, too, would the audience on Tuesday night be able ''to play its proper role in helping to focus the attention of our country on issues in Nigeria or Ethiopia or Ghana or Cameroon or South Africa.''</p>

        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>PLANS FOR PROTESTS IN PHILADELPHIA -- A national gun control organization that has displayed thousands of gunshot victims' shoes around the country is planning an advertising blitz and special shows of shoes during the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. The organization, Silent March, says its advertisements against guns will appear on 100 city buses and 50 subway trains from July 31 through Aug. 3, though convention managers currently have no plans to make a big issue of gun control. ''These advertisements are a wake-up call to the Republican Party,'' Ellen Freudenheim, a co-founder and director of Silent March, said on Tuesday in announcing the group's plans.</p>

        <p>THE DEBATES</p>
        <p>A QUESTION OF PARTICIPATION -- Gov. George W. Bush says politics just might be more important than principle in deciding whether to back bids by Ralph Nader and Patrick J. Buchanan to be allowed in this fall's presidential debates. ''I don't know,'' Mr. Bush said on Tuesday when asked if he favored letting Mr. Nader, the Green Party nominee, and Mr. Buchanan, the probable Reform Party nominee, join him and Vice President Al Gore on the debate stage. ''I haven't figured out the impact yet.'' Was he saying he would be willing to let them in only if he concluded that it would help his own White House bid? ''I am trying to win, aren't I?'' he replied, flashing a big grin. The Commission on Presidential Debates recommended last week that the debates be open only to candidates receiving the backing of at least 15 percent of voters in national polls.</p>
