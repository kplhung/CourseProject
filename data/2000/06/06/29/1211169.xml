        <p>A rental car was timidly approaching a roundabout that must have looked like a death spiral to Richard Williams during one of his first attempts at English driving rules. Their eyes the size of bottle caps, an uneasy Venus and Serena Williams tried to coach their dad from the back seat.</p>
        <p>''We were having a little trouble, but now we're able to get to the village without any accidents,'' Serena said, discussing the two-mile radius of their rented home near Wimbledon village. ''We're making it a little farther each day.''</p>
        <p>So get out of their way. Roads, lawns, nowhere is safe.</p>
        <p>Together again, the sisters are barreling through the All England Club, with horns blowing and their confidence on high beams. Just as they did when they romped through the United States Open last summer, they are healthy of body and full of enough verbal spirit to irritate Martina Hingis -- once again.</p>
        <p>And if John McEnroe would rather that the duo try a dose of humility -- as listeners said he suggested on television this week -- that is not their style. With a glittering, feathery bow in her hair from the Liberace collection, eighth-seeded Serena Williams dominated Court 18 at high noon with such powerful strokes that she all but left dimples in the strings of the helpless Yvette Basting.</p>
        <p>In 35 minutes, Williams wiped away the 186th-ranked woman in a 6-1, 6-0 warm-up drill. An hour later, fifth-ranked Venus Williams flaunted her speed and wingspan on Court 1 to chase down every angled shot off the racquet of 20th-ranked Ai Sugiyama for a 6-1, 6-4 victory in 65 minutes.</p>
        <p>It was a simple and swift start to a third day of Wimbledon that quickly underwent a gloomy and grumpy transformation. As if on cue, a bank of clouds closed in on the sun. Suddenly, spats started to erupt on the courts and darkness began falling on Pete Sampras's half of the draw.</p>
        <p>As the top-seeded Sampras labored in pain but finally put away Karol Kucera before nightfall, 7-6 (9), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, his path to Roy Emerson's Grand Slam record became easier.</p>
        <p>By early evening, third-seeded Magnus Norman, sixth-seeded Cedric Pioline and 11th-seeded Richard Krajicek had been upset. The only seeded player left in Sampras's half of the draw is No. 9 Thomas Enqvist.</p>
        <p>But can Sampras's body hold out? Today, he appeared even more distressed than usual. In the fourth set, he played through a suddenly inflamed foot.</p>
        <p>For Sampras, every point was a chore. Even as he served for the match at 5-4 in the fourth set, he squandered three match points and double-faulted twice before winning on a whistling second serve down the middle that glanced off Kucera's racquet. Sampras left the grounds without talking and went to a local hospital to have a magnetic resonance imaging test on his left foot. It is unclear whether he will be ready for his match Friday.</p>
        <p>While the men's draw is on the verge of disarray, the women's draw is more intact. Hingis joined the Williams sisters by advancing to the third round today with a 6-4, 6-1 victory against Jing-Qian Yi. Although Anna Kournikova was not considered a viable threat, a Clearasil-packing crowd of boys mourned the instant she was aced by Anne-Gaelle Sidot on match point.</p>
        <p>At least the brokenhearted were civil in their disappointment. Elsewhere, tempers were heating up. After a five-set loss, the prickly Jeff Tarango refused to shake the hand of fellow American Paul Goldstein, and later accused his opponent of faking an injury. During his upset of Krajicek, Wayne Ferreira smashed his racquet in half over a call.</p>
        <p>''I was surprised by the weakness of my racquet,'' Ferreira said. ''I was frustrated. I wasn't angry.''</p>
        <p>The distinction between real emotion and gamesmanship blurred today. It was hard to separate sarcasm from ego when the Williams sisters coyly answered their critics. With their power and sculptured forms, some have wondered when strategy would creep into their game plans. ''We definitely have great bodies, yeah,'' Serena said with a sly smile. ''Nice, slim, sexy bodies. They're right. But to go out the way Venus and I have and win a lot of tournaments -- and have a Grand Slam between us -- I think we have definitely grown in our game.''</p>
        <p>Venus Williams also had her own clever way of addressing any concerns about the sisters' humility.</p>
        <p>''I believe that Serena and I are very polite, because that's the way our parents taught us to be,'' she said. ''But I believe that when Serena and I lose a match it's because we beat ourselves.''</p>
        <p>It's this kind of confidence that rivals that of Hingis, the head honcho of self-esteem. Like Hingis, the Williams sisters have no trouble being blunt about the force of their games.</p>
        <p>''I was popping it today,'' said Serena, who served up eight aces. ''It was amazing. Sometimes, I had to pinch myself.''</p>
        <p>Playing in their first Grand Slam event together since the United States Open because of injuries, the Williams sisters have a way of splashing color on a gray day. Until today, Hingis has had little to say about them. But in a news conference, she was told about Serena's views concerning the dating scene on the tour.</p>
        <p>''I guess there's a lot of action going on around the tour,'' Serena said, taking note of the relationships between Jennifer Carpiati and Xavier Malisse, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf, plus Hingis and Norman. ''Every day I see things. My eyes light up, 'Whoa, I didn't know.'</p>
        <p>''Right now, I'm really focusing on my career. Basically, I'm really trying to keep that No. 1 in life. It's really hard if you get involved in a relationship. Next thing you know, your game goes down; all kinds of things happen.''</p>
        <p>Hingis bristled at the idea that a boyfriend on the tour could be an albatross to anyone's career.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if she has had any experiences, so how can she talk about that?'' Hingis said. ''I don't think my game went down so far, so I'm doing pretty good. I'm happy with my relationship.''</p>
        <p>The back-and-forth is on. But it can only last for so long. Venus, Serena and Hingis are on the same side of the draw.</p>
        <p>''I wish my girls weren't in the same half of the draw,'' Richard Williams said. ''I think one can make it, though. People forget that this whole world is built on confidence. That's why Serena says she should dominate this tournament. Venus and Serena, they're racehorses.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, it's best to get out of their way.</p>
