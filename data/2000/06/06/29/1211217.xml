        <p>James McGreevey, who nearly won the 1997 governor's race and who is the front-runner for next year's Democratic nomination, was all but invisible during the Senate primary that bitterly divided his party along geographic lines.</p>
        <p>But with that contest over, and Mr. McGreevey's own political patrons triumphant -- they also backed Jon S. Corzine's Senate candidacy -- he made a splashy return to the political forefront tonight with a $3 million fund-raiser. The gala event drew hundreds of party stalwarts to the Hilton Hotel here.</p>
        <p>But the evening's checks, ranging from the nominal $500-a-plate to many thousands of dollars, were written not to Mr. McGreevey's campaign account but to the Democratic State Committee. The night's haul, in fact, was a record for the state party.</p>
        <p>Many of his supporters called the total a sign of Mr. McGreevey's credibility as a candidate. ''That's a pile of dough,'' said Robert Sommer, a lobbyist and important Democratic fund-raiser. ''And it makes it very difficult for anyone to compete with him in a primary.''</p>
        <p>But the fact that the state party was the beneficiary spoke volumes about Mr. McGreevey's confidence that he will be its nominee again.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey's advisers said he hoped to raise $17 million for his race and that with tonight's receipts, he already had committments for more than $12 million.</p>
        <p>Thomas P. Giblin, the party's state chairman, viewed the donations as a step toward parity with the better-financed G.O.P.</p>
        <p>''It makes sense from the party's viewpoint to have one candidate for 2001,'' he said, adding that it was unlikely that all $3 million raised tonight would be spent this fall.</p>
        <p>How much of it, then, could Mr. McGreevey -- theoretically, of course -- hope to see spent during his governor's race next year?</p>
        <p>''About half,'' Mr. Giblin said.</p>
