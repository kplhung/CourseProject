      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Canada has become a laboratory for the automobile industry's experiment with selling cars to consumers over the Internet.</p>
        <p>The Canadian subsidiaries of Ford Motor and Toyota Motor have established test Web sites to let consumers in three regions of the country log onto the Internet to buy vehicles -- tests that could foreshadow the parent companies' global strategies.</p>
        <p>Though all automakers maintain Web pages for product and other information, car buyers in Canada can use the Toyota site to compare competitive brands, pick the model and options they want, get a price for their trade-in vehicle, arrange financing and place an order through a participating dealer.</p>
        <p>The Canadians who have tried the test Web sites seem to like them, at least partly because there is no unpleasant bargaining with a smooth-talking showroom salesman.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a haggler, and I don't like to feel that I'm being taken advantage of,'' said Kathryn Tessier, a 38-year-old chiropractor in Brandon, Manitoba, who bought a new Toyota Solara coupe in March through the Web site. ''This way, there's a bottom-line price -- it's the same deal for everyone.''</p>
        <p>An appealing feature, Miss Tessier said, was the ability to see how different options affected the total price. That led her to buy a coupe instead of her original choice, a convertible. She was also able to compare financing plans easily. She then took a test drive at a local dealer, Precision Toyota in Brandon. ''I had to see the car,'' she said. ''I just couldn't order it over the Internet.''</p>
        <p>Although car manufacturers are venturing into Internet sales slowly, the idea is nothing new. E-commerce car-dealer specialists like CarsDirect.com and carOrder.com have expanded quickly in the United States, and cars4u.com is about to begin operations in Canada.</p>
        <p>Online sales of new and used cars in the United States amounted to $19 billion last year, about 3 percent of the total market, according to Gomez Advisors, a research firm in Lincoln, Mass. But it says that by 2002, Internet auto purchases will exceed $140 billion annually, almost a 20 percent share.</p>
        <p>Such a potentially huge increase in sales is an important reason that the automakers are at least testing the business of selling on the Internet, in cooperation with conventional dealers who feel threatened by their online competitors.</p>
        <p>''Car companies control the market through dealers, and as Internet players gain more control of the purchasing process, it will be tougher for dealers to maintain their profits and their relationships with buyers,'' said Dennis DesRosiers, a Toronto-based automotive consultant.</p>
        <p>Internet car dealers do not see it that way. Barry Shafran, president of cars4u.com, said the automakers' programs would appeal to ''consumers who are not educated -- it's still the dealers who are setting prices.'' Internet car retailers, he pointed out, need to own dealerships themselves to buy new vehicles from automakers. And orders placed through manufacturers' Web sites are routed through a dealer, usually one selected by the buyer. Someone from the dealership also has to make one house call to get a signature on an order form and perhaps another to deliver the car.</p>
        <p>The Ford Motor Company of Canada Ltd. recently began a larger test program than Toyota's, with 24 participating dealers. It is selling only three brands online -- Focus, Taurus and Windstar -- in two regions of Ontario: in the populous Niagara Peninsula in the south and around the federal capital of Ottawa in the east. Toyota is selling in one region, the area around Winnipeg, Manitoba, with eight dealers participating.</p>
        <p>Although Ford contends that its BuyerConnection program is the only ''direct-order-to-the-manufacturer automotive Web site available today,'' it, too, is set up for sales through dealers.</p>
        <p>Studies show that Canadians spend as much time on the Internet as Americans do, but that they are more timid online shoppers and that 80 percent of those who buy cars hate dickering over price. The Ford and Toyota Internet projects eliminate price negotiations. Participating dealers provide what are described as discounted, or competitive, market prices.</p>
        <p>Initially, the manufacturers expect many more shopping visits than buying visits to their Web pages. ''But by the time they arrive in the dealer's showroom they are going to be pretty well armed with information about the vehicle they are going to buy,'' said Stephen Beattie, a spokesman for Toyota in Toronto.</p>
        <p>''We're modernizing the way we do business,'' he said. ''We're not trying to move to direct sales. But consumers want more information up front, and this is a tool for them.''</p>
        <p>Ford says its program is an ''integration of the bricks and clicks.''</p>
        <p>Total activity on Toyota's Web site increased 40 percent in the first month of the Internet sales test, Mr. Beattie said. It will probably become available across Canada in the fall. In the United States, Toyota Motor Sales has begun a similar test project in the Seattle-Tacoma area, with 19 dealer participants.</p>
