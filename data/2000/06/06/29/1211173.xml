        <p>Rick J. Varone, the chief executive of Staten Island University Hospital, told the board of directors Tuesday night that he was retiring immediately. He will be replaced by Andrew J. Passeri, who was an executive vice president of the hospital.</p>
        <p>Mr. Varone, who became chief executive in 1989, was the architect of an enormous expansion of the hospital, which found itself struggling to compete with centers in Manhattan and New Jersey. While he built many clinical programs and enticed many patients away from other hospitals, he also found himself at the center of controversy.</p>
        <p>In September, in one of the largest settlements ever between a health care provider in a Medicaid fraud case, the hospital agreed to reimburse the state Medicaid program $45 million for improper bills it had submitted over a five-year period, and to provide $39 million in free care for indigent patients over the next 20 years.</p>
        <p>More recently, the State Department of Health harshly criticized the center for 40 violations and fined it  $80,000 for failing to monitor and discipline its chief of neurosurgery, who the state said had operated on the wrong side of a patient's brain, among other blunders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Varone, who is 62, said that these recent problems had no bearing on his sudden announcement to step down. ''I have been talking to the board about this for a year,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''You reach a point in the job of C.E.O. of a hospital system when it is time to move on, and my wife wanted me to leave. I want to spend more time living my life.''</p>
        <p>Several board members confirmed those plans. ''Yes, there have been problems along the way, but they were not his fault in any way,'' said Dr. Albert Accettola, a retired doctor who sits on the hospital's board. ''I admired his work. I thought he did a marvelous job. I had heard he was looking to retire.''</p>
        <p>One of the first things Mr. Varone did after taking the helm of Staten Island was to oversee its merger with Richmond Memorial Hospital. Then he worked to improve the size and quality of clinical programs, building some from the ground up. The center's radiation oncology center was among the early projects, and a burn center and microsurgery unit came later. He was also working to build a major heart center.</p>
        <p>''Varone has done significant, wonderful things for our hospital,'' said Roger Acker, the honorary lifetime chairman of the board. ''I think he decided it is time to start smelling the roses.''</p>
