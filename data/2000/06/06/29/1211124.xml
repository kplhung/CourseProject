        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Brent Staples's June 23 Editorial Observer, ''The Mississippification of California Schools,'' has much truth in it. However, the problem is far more complex than Proposition 13, a lack of investment and certified teachers.</p>
        <p>Demographics of students have changed greatly in the last 20 years. Sixty percent of California children speak a language other than English. The fads presented to California teachers have increasingly been at the direction of a state political bureaucracy that changes its preferences with the wind.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Brent Staples's June 23 Editorial Observer, ''The Mississippification of California Schools,'' has much truth in it. However, the problem is far more complex than Proposition 13, a lack of investment and certified teachers.</p>
        <p>Demographics of students have changed greatly in the last 20 years. Sixty percent of California children speak a language other than English. The fads presented to California teachers have increasingly been at the direction of a state political bureaucracy that changes its preferences with the wind.</p>
        <p>Policy Analysis for California Education is correct when it urges a moratorium on further political ''help.'' The state needs to allow local districts to meet their own challenges in ways that involve local parents and teachers.</p>

        <p>The writer is an associate professor of educational management at the University of La Verne.</p>
