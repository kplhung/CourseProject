        <p>On a day largely devoted to displaying its political and fiscal mastery, the Kremlin issued its long-awaited plan to overhaul Russia's creaking economy today. True to predictions, it was the very model of modern Western economic theory.</p>
        <p>It was also considerably bolder than almost any plans that most Western nations have ever tried to push past suspicious voters and hardened special interests. But given the overwhelming popularity President Vladimir V. Putin is enjoying these days, outside experts say that for the moment, anyway, it actually has a chance to become law.</p>
        <p>Perhaps by design, the unveiling of the fiscal plan almost overshadowed the day's other major event: a solid vote by Russia's upper house of Parliament against Mr. Putin's plan to effectively disband it, fire its members and replace them with senators elected by secret ballots.</p>
        <p>The upper house, the Federation Council, voted 129 to 13 against the proposal, averting what one newspaper called Mr. Putin's proposal for ritual suicide. But many experts said the council may only have stayed the execution. Russia's lower house, which is solidly in Mr. Putin's hand and which overwhelmingly passed the measure earlier this month, seemed ready to override the vote and make the proposal law.</p>
        <p>With the new economic blueprint that it announced today, the Kremlin aims to slash the subsidies that have kept utility rates here outrageously low, and wipe out the unpaid wages, tax breaks and other obligations that have sapped the government's already limited spending power. It also will devise an entirely new energy policy for the world's largest and almost coldest nation.</p>
        <p>And those are but the major goals for this year. The rest of the plan proposes radical changes in everything from the nation's moribund banking system to its pension funds, now carved up among a bevy of government fiefs.</p>
        <p>Westerners were approving. ''It's a strong, liberal reform program,'' said Al Breach, an economist with Goldman Sachs in Moscow. ''These are the same reforms that have been bandied around in I.M.F. and World Bank programs for years, but this time it's the Russians themselves doing it.''</p>
        <p>The program was debated for months in the government and in a government research group led by the new minister of trade and economy, German Gref, which drew up the plan.</p>
        <p>In a briefing today, the prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, asserted that the government could ensure economic growth of 5 percent a year, and strengthen the ruble by half, should the proposals become law.</p>
        <p>History suggests that the changes may not be so simple to carry out. Countless reform programs under former President Boris N. Yeltsin were forgotten as soon as they were published, often perishing beneath the opposition of the Communist-dominated lower house, the Duma.</p>
        <p>But the Duma, as well as the public, is now firmly behind Mr. Putin. And with the economy buoyed by profits from soaring oil prices, it may be easier to push otherwise painful reforms through the Parliament.</p>
        <p>The government's program calls for raising energy prices, which still lag far behind the cost of production, and for greater fiscal openness in the operations of Russia's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom. A private savings system for pensions could be instituted as early as next year, while action on bank reform, which Mr. Kasyanov called a crucial goal, was put off until the fall.</p>
        <p>The lower house has already passed changes to the tax code largely drafted by the Kremlin, and the government is drawing up plans to discipline the regions' finances. The proposed tax changes would reduce the burden on companies by 20 percent this year.</p>
        <p>But before the lower house delves deeply into Mr. Putin's economic proposals, it is expected to complete his restructuring of the upper house, and that could come as soon as Friday, the Duma's deputy speaker said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's backers in the Duma said flatly that they had the 300 votes needed to override the upper house's vote today.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Putin's supporters succeed, they will have ratified the most sweeping change in the government since Mr. Yeltsin put down a Communist coup and drew up a new Constitution in 1993. The council's current 178 members, all appointees, consist of the all-powerful governors of Russia's 89 regions and the 89 leaders of their regional legislatures.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin would replace them with the governors' and legislators' nominees, who would have to survive a secret ballot by local legislators to  win their four-year terms.</p>
        <p>The proposal is part of Mr. Putin's pledge to restore central control in Russia. He has already carved the nation into seven super-regions and put his personal appointee in charge of federal money, patronage and law enforcement in each.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's aides took the Federal Council's veto calmly. ''This move was predictable,'' the Interfax news service quoted a Kremlin official as saying. ''There is no cause for worry.''</p>
        <p>The members of the Federation Council accused Mr. Putin of trying  to subvert Russia's Constitution and pull off a coup.</p>
        <p>In debate before today's vote, they proposed a constitutional convention of sorts at which the final structure of Russia's democracy would be drafted. But Boris Gryzlov, the head of the Unity faction, which essentially represents Mr. Putin in the Duma, said the legislators were no longer interested in the upper chamber's ideas.</p>
        <p>''I do not see any need in initiating conciliatory procedures,'' he said.  ''All this is a thing of the past.''</p>
