        <p>Hours after the United States Supreme Court declined to hear arguments in the Elian Gonzalez case, the 6-year-old left behind seven months of contention, conflict and court battles, and returned home to Cuba tonight with his father.</p>
        <p>Elian arrived to the embrace of relatives and the excited cheers of hundreds of flag-waving children. A crowd of students hurriedly bused in from their hometown of Cardenas waved flags and chanted: ''Elian! Elian!''</p>
        <p>They arrived just in time to meet the two planes that ferried Elian, his father and other friends and relatives from Washington. Moments later, his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, carried the boy off the plane and into the arms of his grandparents, including his two grandmothers, who had made an unsuccessful journey to reclaim the boy in January.</p>
        <p>As the boy was swept up in the arms of his grandfather, his schoolmates began singing the Cuban national anthem, and the announcer on national television described the scene.</p>
        <p>''Look at the torture they said Elian would be subjected to,'' the announcer said, referring to the claims by Cuban-Americans that the boy was being returned to a grim fate. ''That is passion. That is affection.''</p>
        <p>Despite the excitement of the small crowd at the airport, Elian was quiet, waving at times to his friends. No public remarks were made, and Cuban officials did not plan any news conferences or rallies.</p>
        <p>President Fidel Castro did not greet the child at Jose Marti International Airport, being represented instead by Ricardo Alarcon, the president of the National Assembly, who has guided the campaign for Elian's return. The airport ceremony lasted only 10 minutes before the child and his entourage were whisked off in a caravan to an undisclosed location.</p>
        <p>The homecoming was subdued, with no other rallies or marches taking place in the city. But Cubans were reminded of the importance of Elian's return, much the same way that Mr. Castro had seized on it as a case of national respect and a way to win points in his long battle with the United States. In countless past rallies, the case had been used to criticize the United States' 38-year-old trade embargo against Cuba, the conservative Cuban American National Foundation and the Cuban Adjustment Act, which grants asylum to Cubans who reach American soil.</p>
        <p>As national television broadcast the caravan leaving the airport, the voice of Elpidio Valdes, Elian's favorite cartoon character, took over the narration.</p>
        <p>''Welcome, Eliancito,'' he said. ''Now we have to keep the battle against the Cuban Adjustment Act, the blockade and the foundation.''</p>
        <p>Elian, his father, his stepmother, Nersy, and his half brother, Hianny, left Dulles International Airport in Virginia at 4:41 p.m., just hours after the Supreme Court declined to hear arguments presented by lawyers for Elian's relatives in Miami that the child had been denied a right to an asylum hearing.</p>
        <p>As Elian and his family made their way to the airport, television viewers watched a strikingly familiar scene from the vantage of helicopters as the motorcade snaked along traffic-free highways, a white Suburban in the lead. The coverage was reminiscent of the white Bronco chase at the start of the O. J. Simpson murder case in 1994.</p>
        <p>In November, Elian's mother and 10 others drowned in a failed ocean crossing from Cuba, and the boy was left floating alone in an inner tube off the Florida coast. The Supreme Court's decision today was the final development in a series of court challenges brought by Elian's Miami relatives, who cared for the boy after he was rescued last Thanksgiving until armed federal agents took him from them and reunited him with his father in late April.</p>
        <p>Within minutes of the announcement in Washington today that Elian could go home, Cuban radio and television interrupted their programming to proclaim the boy's impending arrival once the injunction that kept the child and his father in the United States expired at 4 p.m.</p>
        <p>Elian was to go from the airport to a reunion with relatives and friends at an undisclosed location. From there, he would go for an undetermined period to a special school in Havana, where teachers and psychologists would prepare him for his return to Cardenas.</p>
        <p>Before leaving Washington, Elian's father said in brief remarks that his experience in the United States had been a good one. He said he hoped Cuba and the United States would strengthen their ties.</p>
        <p>''Despite all my family's suffering, I think that this has allowed me to meet very beautiful and brilliant people in this country,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. ''And I hope in the future, this same impression I took from this country, can become true between Cuba and the United States.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton, asked at a news conference whether he had any reservations about Elian's return home and his administration's role in the outcome, said today that he had replayed it all in his head many times, and had concluded that his administration had done the proper thing.</p>
        <p>''Do I wish it had unfolded in a less dramatic, traumatic way for all concerned?'' Mr. Clinton asked. ''Of course, I do.''</p>
        <p>The bottom line, he said, was the father's right to be with his child.</p>
        <p>The boy's rescue and the attempts of his Miami relatives to keep him in America unleashed an international drama that complicated the United States' relationship with Cuba. In the end, it embroiled the White House, stirred up the presidential campaign, revitalized President Castro and tarnished the standing of the politically powerful Cuban-American population in Miami.</p>
        <p>And in a twist that few could have anticipated, the case helped galvanize support in the United States for more relaxed ties to Cuba. On Tuesday, Congress negotiated a deal to permit food sales to Cuba, with restrictions.</p>
        <p>In Miami today, supporters of the Miami relatives gathered outside the Little Havana house to mourn Elian's return to Havana. A few lashed out at reporters and cursed the Clinton administration. Many praised the Miami relatives for their persistence and expressed disbelief that most Americans believe Elian belongs in Communist Cuba. ''We are devastated that at this very moment Elian's going back to live in a country where he'll never be free,'' said Armando Gutierrez, the spokesman for the boy's Miami relatives.</p>
        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno, who had tried to persuade the Miami relatives, face to face, to turn the boy over, wished Elian well.</p>
        <p>''This little boy now knows that he can remain with his father,'' Ms. Reno said in a statement today. ''All involved have had an opportunity to make their case -- all the way to the highest court in the land. I hope that everyone will accept the Supreme Court's decision.''</p>
        <p>The Justice Department spent at least $1.8 million through June 11 on reuniting Elian with his father, assigning scores of officials and negotiators to the case.</p>
        <p>The legal challenge began in Miami, where Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, petitioned the courts for custody and for the right to request an asylum hearing for the boy. That was denied, and Mr. Gonzalez carried out a series of appeals.</p>
        <p>In Havana today, there were few joyous outbursts, in contrast to the huge public rallies that had taken place across Cuba calling for Elian's return. A few people sported worn-out Elian T-shirts that were worn by hundreds of thousands at past rallies. The sprawling seaside plaza that was specially built in January to hold demonstrations in front of the offices of the American government here was unusually empty.</p>
        <p>Many people quietly expressed relief that the boy was returning after months of what they said was manipulation by Cuban-Americans, whom they faulted for having tried to sway the child with gifts, favors and the promise of a better life.</p>
        <p>''It was time he came back to be with his family, his people,'' one woman said.</p>
        <p>Sitting with some friends in the shade of a fruit stand at a market, another woman, Barbara D'Escovert agreed: ''He will not be bad off here. He has a good house ready, and a school, too. His father wants to stay here in Cuba.''</p>
        <p>A friend interrupted with a skeptical frown.</p>
        <p>''Says who?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Ms. D'Escovert shrugged him off.</p>
        <p>''After everything Fidel has said, you think he would stay in the United States?'' she continued. ''He has a duty to return. The people put out a lot of effort for his return.''</p>
        <p>Her friend, who refused to give his name, was unswayed.</p>
        <p>''They treated him well over there,'' he said. ''One day he'll have his life made. Over there.''</p>
