        <p>''THE best thing about this neighborhood is you can step outside to get the paper and not see anybody you know,'' Mario Nievera said. Which can be a blessing, he added, ''because we live pretty public lives here.''</p>
        <p>''Here'' is Palm Beach, a posh playground for Vanderbilts, Astors and their ilk since the 1920's, and Mr. Nievera is not being boastful about the high-profile existence shared by him and his partner, Robert Janjigian. A gregarious, notebook-wielding presence at cocktail parties and charity events, Mr. Janjigian, 42, is the fashion editor of The Palm Beach Daily News, known as The Shiny Sheet for its slick finish. The gardens Mr. Nievera, 35, creates for members of the local fete set show up in Architectural Digest.  Yet, their primary residence is comfortably modest. So is its location.</p>
        <p>Sixty-seven miles north of Miami, West Palm is Palm Beach's renegade mainland sister, the grinning tomboy who married the family chauffeur and settled down to car pool and lunchbox bliss. Pockmarked with strip malls and laced with freeway asphalt, the city was founded in 1894 as the railroad stop for moneyed New Yorkers escaping harsh winters, so its landscape is nowhere as grand as that found across the bridge in Palm Beach. There the shady streets are lined with Norma Desmond Spanish villas designed in the 1920's by Addison Mizner, a theatrical architect and flimflam man.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nievera and Mr. Janjigian's house, on the other hand, is an Eisenhower-era relic, which they bought for $80,000 four years ago. A tidy sugar cube of pale beige stucco smoothly troweled over concrete blocks, its mass-market modernism shelters two bedrooms and one bath. The front door is tucked inside the carport and leads directly into the kitchen. ''I couldn't do anything about the placement of the front door, so this part of the garden is designed like a vestibule,'' Mr. Nievera said, opening a gate cut into a thick viburnum hedge alongside the house.</p>
        <p>Their slim-jim trunks standing at attention like green sculptures in a pale marble room, a formal allee of Alexander coconut palms sprouts from a carpet of glistening white pebbles. ''It's very easy to maintain,'' Mr. Nievera said. ''You see every leaf that falls, so you have to pick it up.'' Soft mounds of Mexican heather and butterfly bush soften the edges of the formal French-influenced layout, and funky metal and wire chairs painted white or delicate hydrangea blue peek through the tropical greenery.</p>
        <p>Though it seems peaceful, traffic goes by all the time, ''so it was on the market for a while,'' Mr. Nievera said. (High-profile additions to the city like the Raymond F. Kravis Center for the Performing Arts, the prestigious Palm Beach Antiques Show and the CityPlace housing development have sent real estate prices skyrocketing.)</p>
        <p>As for their house, there were myriad drawbacks. Crank-out jalousie windows, for instance, were once the last word in low-maintenance chic, but half the panes had fallen out. Indoors was an air-conditioner free zone of white and teal blue. And the flat wood roof, he recalled with a shudder, leaked. ''At first, I thought I would just fix it up and sell it,'' Mr. Nievera said, adding that the house was built in 1957 as a retirement home for its previous owner, a librarian.</p>
        <p>In addition, it sat in the front half of a 25-by-100-foot lot that was a blank horticultural slate. There was nary a shrub, Mr. Nievera recalled. He threw himself into basic improvements. ''Robert was still living in New York, and he would not move in without air-conditioning,'' he said. Nor was Mr. Janjigian thrilled with the kitchen's worn Formica countertops and outmoded appliances.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nievera changed the windows, too, replacing most with aluminum-frame French doors that opened the house's 1,200 square feet to the surrounding gardens, a space-enhancement underscored by new Italian-tile floors whose worn-white color blends with the outdoor gravel.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we've made even $20,000 worth of improvements,'' Mr. Nievera said. Indeed, like his partner, Mr. Nievera is a devotee of cheap chic. ''Those came from Pier 1,'' he said, pointing out the galvanized tin lanterns that punctuate the corners of the thin white swimming pool out back.</p>
        <p>White chaise longues, vintage Knoll, were castoffs from a landscape client, and the cedar-walled outdoor shower was built from a kit ordered from Walpole Woodworkers in Maine. Thanks to the no-winter climate, ''we have yet to use the shower inside the house,'' Mr. Nievera said.</p>
        <p>When the house had been upgraded, he gratefully handed over the decorating reins to Mr. Janjigian, who was formerly an editor at Rizzoli and wrote a book about yacht interiors. Still, Mr. Nievera was momentarily worried. Living in a small house requires a certain amount of restraint, and ''Robert has a tendency to overcollect,'' he said. ''We have a garage sale twice a year.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Janjigian, whose black-frame glasses and firm jaw give him a Cary Grant-like suavity, laughed. ''O.K., so I'm a scavenger,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One of his primary sites for shopping is the nearby town of Lake Worth, where stylish vintage furniture often goes for prices that make out-of-town friends jealous.</p>
        <p>''That was $300,'' he said of one of his Lake Worth finds, a 1940's chest, its sides paved with smoked mirror (it opens to reveal cocktail equipment). A pair of sleek Danish Modern chairs from the 1960's cost $30 from the Goodwill thrift shop in West Palm. The big square ottoman in the combination guest room and office was rescued from a Manhattan sidewalk and snappily recovered in white patent leather.</p>
        <p>As for the artwork, it is a motley array, ranging from two dozen Russel Wright wall clocks in the kitchen -- one for every hour of the day, said Mr. Janjigian, who bought them on eBay -- to three hypnotic photographs of rippling blue water snapped by the makeup maven Evelyn Lauder.</p>
        <p>''I tried a million things up there,'' Mr. Janjigian said of a long narrow bit of wall above a built-in shelving unit that his partner designed for the dining area. After a while, he settled on a bad 1960's painting of skyscrapers, as seen from the Statue of Liberty. ''Of course, it would be ideal to have a Rothko,'' he said with a grin. ''But we're not quite there yet.''</p>
        <p>Though he wanted to respect its architecture, Mr. Janjigian also wanted to avoid transforming the house into a picture-perfect paean to mid-century modernism. ''And I didn't want to get too fussy,'' he said. ''When you have a small space, you have to pick things that don't fill it up.'' Which explains why the furnishings are few but juxtaposed with spirit, creating uncomplicated but visually stimulating roomscapes.</p>
        <p>The chaise longue in the living area is classic Le Corbusier, but the exuberant gilt sconce hanging nearby is pure Palm Beach baroque, circa 1962. A bedspread printed with big tropical leaves gives a Heywood-Wakefield side table a funky South Beach look. And even though the couple try to keep Palm Beach at a distance in their private life, a bit of it remains in view: a little Torquemada-style carved wood stool that  once graced a mansion in Palm Beach.  ''Yeah, it's Mizner,'' Mr. Janjigian admitted, adding added, diplomatically: ''I mean, I had to buy it. After all, we do live here.''</p>
        <p>Budget-conscious tastemakers favor consignment and secondhand shops on South County Road in Palm Beach and Lake Avenue and Dixie Highway in Lake Worth. They are filled with ''very 1940's and 1950's glamorous kinds of stuff, things you know once  lived in a great house, with people with style,'' said Mish Tworkowski, a Manhattan jeweler and Sotheby's expert -- like red metal chandeliers in the shape of coral branches and fiercely button-tufted sofas a la Syrie Maugham. Margo de Peyster, a leader of Palm Beach's young social set, recommended the Church Mouse thrift shop at 374 South County Road in Palm Beach, (561) 659-2154. Other excellent sources are the Goodwill shop (561) 832-8893 and the dealer Peter Werner (561) 832-0428.</p>
