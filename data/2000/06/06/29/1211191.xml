        <p>Taiwan's new president said the magic words more clearly than ever this week, telling visitors that his government could agree with China's government that there is only ''one China.''</p>
        <p>But he added a condition that Beijing has said it cannot accept: that Taiwan and China must be able to interpret those words in different ways.</p>
        <p>With his latest statement, President Chen Shui-bian, the former opposition candidate and independence advocate who took office in May, came tantalizingly close to a formula that might draw Beijing into peace talks.</p>
        <p>A security aide in Taipei, Taiwan's capital, told reporters that the statement, made on Tuesday to visiting Americans and reported in newspapers today, was ''the new government's most authoritative, sincere and good-will policy statement.''</p>
        <p>What Mr. Chen said clearly for the first time was that his administration could accept an approach that was successfully used in 1992 to defuse the dispute over Taiwan's political relationship to the mainland.</p>
        <p>''The new government is willing to accept a consensus that there is one China, but each side could have its own interpretation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In 1992, with a similar, ambiguous oral agreement about Taiwan's political status, the two sides began talks between semiofficial representatives. Beijing ended those talks last year when Taiwan's president at the time, Lee Teng-hui, asserted that Taiwan and China had a ''state-to-state relationship.''</p>
        <p>Now, after the election victory by Mr. Chen, each side claims to have a different memory of how the sovereignty issue was finessed in 1992. While Beijing did not immediately respond to Mr. Chen's latest remarks, Chinese officials have said in recent weeks that they could never agree to multiple interpretations of ''one China.''</p>
        <p>Behind the word games is a fundamental chasm: most Taiwanese want the island to keep its de facto independent status, while China insists, on threat of war, that Taiwan must agree to rejoin the motherland.</p>
        <p>Beijing was angered on Tuesday when it learned that Britain had allowed Mr. Lee to make an ostensibly private visit. China calls Mr. Lee a troublemaker whose travels are intended to further Taiwanese independence.</p>
