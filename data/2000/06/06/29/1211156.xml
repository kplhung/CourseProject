        <p>A battle over Unified Energy Systems, Russia's electricity monopoly, intensified today after a group of foreign investors who oppose a plan to overhaul the company took their case to the Kremlin. The government controls more than half the company.</p>
        <p>Investors representing about 15 percent of the company's stock met with Aleksandr Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff. Mr. Voloshin, an important figure in President Vladimir V. Putin's administration, is also chairman of Unified Energy's board.</p>
        <p>The meeting came a week after disenchanted investors asked Mr. Putin to stop the restructuring plan, which they say would destroy the value of their holdings.</p>
        <p>The dispute over Unified Energy, the most actively traded stock in Russia, is viewed as a litmus test of the new Putin administration's attentiveness to foreign investors as well as its commitment to strengthening Russia's power resources.</p>
        <p>The restructuring plan would break up Unified Energy's vast network of generating stations and distributors into companies that could then be sold.</p>
        <p>The government has yet to formulate a position on the plan. But its opinion is important, as it is the single largest shareholder in Unified Energy, with a 53 percent stake. Its vote is crucial to the fate of the plan and in any move to overrule the plan's author, Anatoly B. Chubais, the company's chief executive.</p>
        <p>The dispute pits investors against Mr. Chubais, architect of Russia's privatization program and previously a favorite among foreign investors in many Russian companies because of his pro-Western views.</p>
        <p>Now, investors are criticizing Mr. Chubais for pushing ahead with a plan they say will allow powerful local business groups to buy up power industry assets at bargain prices. They say he has ignored their proposals to alter the plan. In an open letter to shareholders posted on Unified Energy's Web site tonight, Mr. Chubais replied directly to those concerns, saying, ''I am listening, but are you?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Voloshin, an opponent of Mr. Chubais, wields vast power in the Kremlin and the government. He was surprised by how strongly the investors felt about the restructuring, a person close to the situation said.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Voloshin's position is still unclear, government opposition could halt Mr. Chubais's plan, or more seriously, threaten his position in the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chubais presented a revised plan last week, but investors say it was little changed from an earlier version. They say the plan is still too vague on how regional energy companies will be split off from the main grid. Investors want regional companies merged and sold as larger units.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chubais does not need the approval of shareholders to begin carrying out the plan, although he has pledged to show it to investors first.</p>
        <p>Last year, shareholders amended the company charter to require a 75 percent vote to oust Mr. Chubais, who became chief executive of the company in 1998. Investors have threatened to call an emergency shareholders meeting in July and possibly attempt an ouster. The government and foreign investors together represent more than 80 percent of the company's stock.</p>
        <p>Unified Energy stock is trading  about 11.5 cents a share, down about 40 percent since the end of March, just before Mr. Chubais first formulated the restructuring plan.</p>
        <p>Russia's benchmark stock index is down about 24 percent over the same period.</p>
