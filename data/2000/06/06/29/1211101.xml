        <p>Visitors to this small Southern city (metropolitan population: 570,000) are often struck by the gap between its reputation as an intellectual backwater and the reality of its cultural offerings: a nationally recognized symphony, a civic ballet, a comprehensive university fine arts department, two repertory theater companies and a small but state-of-the-art performance center.</p>
        <p>City officials seeking to recruit corporate and industrial businesses always include a tour of the newly expanded Arkansas Arts Center, which is now, more than ever, at the heart of Little Rock's cultural life. A two-year campaign that ended in February raised $22 million, which was used mostly to increase the center's gallery and classroom space from 65,000 square feet to 100,000. On a recent visit, President Clinton pronounced himself ''overwhelmed'' as he was led through the center's new two-story atrium of blond wood and slate into a gallery.</p>
        <p>The center's permanent collection includes a Diego Rivera painting, ''Two Women''; a Degas pastel, ''Dancing Trios Before Class''; a Rodin bust of a young Balzac; and a Picasso oil, ''Still Life With Red Bull's Head,'' among other works. There are works on paper by  Delacroix, Vuillard, Bonnard, van Gogh, Rubens  and Rembrandt, and sculpture by Louise Nevelson and Henry Moore.</p>
        <p>The permanent collection is valued at $40 million, according to Townsend Wolfe, the Arts Center's director and chief curator. Janie C. Lee, a curator at large for the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, described the center's holdings as ''incredibly important.''</p>
        <p>The Arts Center's first serious benefactor was Winthrop Rockefeller, who served as Arkansas's governor. When he moved to the state in the 1950's Rockefeller found Arkansas's cultural menu rather skimpy. So he set about replacing the down-at-the-heels Museum of Fine Arts, which by that point t townspeople essentially ignored.He led a fund-raising campaign in Arkansas for a new arts center to be constructed around the old, seeded the project withhis own money and coaxed more from his brothers Nelson, David, Laurance and John.</p>
        <p>''Win was the key man,'' recalled Jeane Hamilton, 74, doyenne of the Little Rock arts community. ''The museum was a dead beast, and the arts were something the people of Little Rock had not given a lot of thought to. Without Win, we would have never got the center off the ground.''</p>
        <p>After the Arkansas Arts Center opened in 1963, Mr. Rockefeller and his wife, Jeanette, struggled to keep it afloat financially. The center was started as a degree-granting institution with ambitious programs in theater, sculpture and painting. Almost immediately, it had staggering deficits, which Mr. Rockefeller absorbed for a while. In its first four years it had five directors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfe, a native of South Carolina, was recruited for the job of director by Mr. and Mrs.  Rockefeller in 1968 from a teaching position at the Wooster School in Danbury, Conn..</p>
        <p>''I told Win that I would take the job on condition that I run the place with no meddling by others,'' Mr. Wolfe remembered. ''I said, 'If I'm going to be fired it's because I didn't do the job, not because I let somebody else try.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfe, who was then 32, set about imposing order on the artistic and administrative chaos he discovered in Arkansas. ''I tried to figure out how they ran up those deficits,'' he said, ''and I never could.'' He eliminated the degree programs, restricted performing arts to a children's theater and, crucially, narrowed the center's acquisitions focus to French, Italian and American drawings ''because it was something at which we could excel.''</p>
        <p>The passion of that era for paintings, Mr. Wolfe said, made the acquisition of drawings easier and less expensive. ''Few institutions and fewer people were collecting drawings back then,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For example, he snatched up a Richard Diebenkorn watercolor for $3,500 in 1973; today, Mr. Wolfe suggested, it might fetch $150,000.</p>
        <p>''Most people want paintings for their historical value,'' said Ms. Lee, the Whitney curator, ''and drawings are of secondary importance to them. Townsend had the courage to see beyond that, to recognize that drawings aren't secondary. And the level of quality he's maintained in Arkansas makes that collection very significant.''</p>
        <p>Werner Kramarsky of New York, a prominent collectors of works on paper, described the Arkansas museum's holdings ''as one of the most important contemporary drawings collections in the United States.''</p>
        <p>''It's an almost immeasurable treasure, a superb example of careful, connoisseur-based collecting,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In 1973, the center took a gamble to broaden its financial base by rejecting a bequest of $1 million from the executors for Mr. Rockefeller, who died that year. ''People would have thought Win was taking care of us from the grave,'' Mr. Wolfe explained.</p>
        <p>Instead Mr. Wolfe suggested that the trustees challenge the center to raise $500,000 from local private sources with a 3-to-1 matching provision from the Rockefeller estate. When Arkansans responded by contributing $750,000 in two months, the Rockefeller family matched the extra $250,000 as well.</p>
        <p>''The people of Arkansas had to have title to it, had to feel that it was truly theirs before the arts center could flourish,'' Mr. Wolfe said.</p>
        <p>The center continues to benefit from Rockefeller support nonetheless. Lieut. Gov. Winthrop Paul Rockefeller, son of Winthrop, is a contributor, and Abby Rockefeller Mauze, sister to the five brothers, donated the Rivera. David Rockefeller donated a 1912 oil by Redon, ''Andromeda.'' Laurance S. Rockefeller contributed 22 drawings and prints this year.</p>
        <p>But the center's latest, and largest, benefactors have been homegrown. Jackson T. Stephens, a Little Rock investment banker, contributed $5 million to the expansion campaign, then donated the Picasso, the Degas and 13 other works from his private collection. They include oils by Degas, Bonnard, Monet, Vuillard and Pissaro.</p>
        <p>Recently James Dyke, a local businessman,  deeded to the center his collection of 133 watercolors and sketches by Paul Signac. This collection will tour Europe and stop at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York before returning to Arkansas.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Wolfe's 32 years as director the arts center's endowment has grown from $34,000 to almost $23 million, and its holdings have expanded from fewer than 800 works to more than 4,000.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of thousands of people -- measured in contributions, gallery visits, outreach programs and enrollment in arts classes -- are involved in the center, and its annual fund-raising dinner and auction is the highlight of Arkansas's spring social season.</p>
        <p>''When I first started going to New York to buy things, the reaction was, 'Who is this sucker?' '' Mr. Wolfe said.''I don't get that any more.''</p>
