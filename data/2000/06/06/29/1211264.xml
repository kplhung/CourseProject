        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Real versus virtual libraries: they both provide you with information, but it's like reading about falling in love versus actually doing it. When I was 16 and a shy small-town girl across the Delaware from Philadelphia, I rode a bus into the big city to do some homework research at the main library on Logan Circle. There were probably some girls there, but all I saw were boys, boys and more boys. While searching through a card catalog (remember those?) a young man asked if I would watch his books for a few minutes. When he came back he struck up a conversation, then walked me downtown to catch my bus home, thus beginning a short but emotionally powerful relationship that I still recall vividly to this day -- as we all recall our first loves. Libraries are real places in the real world, with real books to touch and smell and savor. The other treasures -- like people meeting people -- cannot be measured against the learning gleaned from a computer screen.</p>
