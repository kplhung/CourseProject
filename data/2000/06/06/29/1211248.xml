        <p>A memorial service for a famously self-destructive performance artist is about to start, and out on the sidewalk on the Lower East Side, the sousaphonist for the Hungry March Band is teaching the tenor sax player a new song.</p>
        <p>No sheet music is required.</p>
        <p>''We're going to repeat five notes,'' Scott Moore, the man with the big horn, tells Emily Fairey. ''The first three notes everybody drew out of a bag, different notes for everyone. The fourth note is a collective B flat. The fifth note is your choice. It's sort of a tribute to his idea of random chaos.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Fairey nods like a veteran pitcher. ''Got it.''</p>
        <p>An hour later, the band files out of the community center, trailing mourners clad in every possible shade of black. The new song seems to hold the sunlit air still -- three slow chords, noirish and Mingus-y, rising to the clear, piercing B flat, improbably heroic, then dissolving into the final random chord, dense and mysterious as the abyss.</p>
        <p>The band strikes up an improvised funeral march, greasy and soulful, something out of New Orleans by way of Eastern Europe, and steps off in no particular formation. Up Eldridge and onto Houston, children cling to fences to watch the motley band go by, couples gaze bemused from tenement windows, and hipsters sway in front of cafes. Everyone smiles. Everyone loves a parade.</p>
        <p>Until the mid-20th century, outdoor bands, whether marching or stationary, played a vital role in American civic life, adding celebratory notes to every public ritual from a judge's installation to a saloon opening. Bands still roam the streets in places like India and Peru, but outside of Louisiana, professional marching bands have all but vanished from the American landscape.</p>
        <p>''It's a passe thing,'' said Joe Losh, an 81-year-old trumpeter who leads the John Philip Sousa American Legion Post Band in Manhattan and who recalled running from one parade to the next on the day Franklin D. Roosevelt announced the National Recovery Act. ''The old guys don't want to march anymore. The young guys are into rock 'n' roll; they don't want to march. All you got left is the high school bands, and once they graduate they give it up.''</p>
        <p>Larry Siegel, a band leader active in Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians who is sometimes asked to put together marching bands for parades, could not name a single year-round, semi-stable professional marching band in the city. There was, he and Mr. Losh said, simply not enough work anymore to keep a marching band busy.</p>
        <p>The Hungry March Band, a quasi-anarchist collective of 10 to 25 musicians, dancers and twirlers of widely varying abilities from the arty streets of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, begs to differ.</p>
        <p>''There's always someone who needs a marching band,'' said Theresa Westerdahl, 28, one the band's four drummers and its de facto manager.</p>
        <p>It certainly seems that way. In the three dozen or so shows -- about 15 of them paid -- that the band has played in the last year, it has led a pet store's parade of dogs, marched naked across a long white table at a dot-com mogul's millennium party in TriBeCa, serenaded marathon runners and commandeered subway trains at midnight.</p>
        <p>The band marches mostly in its own community and in the radical-friendly East Village and Lower East Side.</p>
        <p>But it has also done the twist in Times Square to protest the city's restrictive cabaret laws, blessed a church's Thanksgiving feast in Sunnyside, Queens, and rallied anti-World Trade Organization troops in Washington.</p>
        <p>The band will play for just about anyone. Last fall, the day after providing sonic support at a Manhattan demonstration against the homogenizing forces of Starbucks and Disney (purse: $200), the band played the opening of a mini-mall in Williamsburg ($400). The mall is no Wal-Mart -- its boutiquey shops are all owned by locals -- but band members were amused to hear themselves accused of selling out.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the political stuff the band does tends to be a little shrill, so it was kind of nice to be able to do the opposite and not be so partisan,'' said Jon Lewis, 36, an artist who plays the marching mellophone, a sort of trumpet-shaped French horn.</p>
        <p>The band's music is a strange blend. Into it go the mixed musical resumes of its members -- lapsed school band nerds, a jazz trumpeter who has played at the Blue Note, a drummer for a hard-core punk band, veterans of New York's experimental-noise scene, and a few near-beginners. Out flows a ragged but usually coherent sound, full of passion and surprises.</p>
        <p>''It's all these kinds of personalities rubbing up against each other, and this is what happens,'' Mr. Lewis said.</p>
        <p>The dress code is similarly loose. A few members wear actual marching-band uniforms scavenged from thrift shops, but they are just as likely to parade in purple robes or white skullcaps or feathers. The band's only nod to militarism is its ever-present flag, depicting an ear above a crossed knife and fork.</p>
        <p>Jenneth Webster, the producer of Lincoln Center Out of Doors, who has booked the band for opening day on Aug. 5, compared Hungry March to the Arkestra, the band led by the late cosmic jazz genius Sun Ra, who claimed to have descended to Earth from Saturn.</p>
        <p>''I believe that every musical ensemble is unique, but they're really unique,'' Ms. Webster said.</p>
        <p>Most of the band's shows evolve into audience participation events. At a march against trash transfer stations in Williamsburg, an old man abandoned his walker and pounded on a piece of sheet metal that was being carried in front of the band. At a winter celebration in the East Village in January, someone in the crowd handed out sleigh bells.</p>
        <p>''People love the marching band,'' said Sasha Sumner, a soprano saxophone player. ''No matter what we're doing, you have a big group of people who want to join in just from hearing it for a second.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes the results can be disorienting. But the music seems able to accommodate a lot of chaos.</p>
        <p>''It's so public that you can't really tell people they can't play,'' Mr. Moore said.</p>
        <p>The band, originally a four-piece, formed in 1997 to play the Coney Island Mermaid Parade, one of the city's freakiest annual public spectacles. (The name, bestowed by a departing founding member, refers both to the band's will-play-for-food business strategy and to a deeper hunger for something raw and real.)</p>
        <p>Then, last spring, an opportunity arose for the band to play at a sex-industry convention at the Javits Convention Center. Ms. Westerdahl, a massage therapist by day, put up recruitment posters around the neighborhood to fill out the sound.</p>
        <p>The selection process was simple but effective.</p>
        <p>''Whoever kept coming got to stay in the band,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Javits Center gig fell through, but the band took off.</p>
        <p>''We would do clandestine marches in the neighborhood,'' said Mr. Moore, a 40-year-old carpenter with a linebacker's build and an Amishman's beard, ''just to take it to the South Side,'' the still largely Hispanic section of Williamsburg. ''To see the smiles on people's faces, the little tykes, the tough guys on the corner digging it, too, really made me take notice of what a generous thing this was, and that's when practices got regular.''</p>
        <p>Practices are happenings in themselves. Sunday afternoons, members gather on an enormous concrete slab overlooking the East River in Williamsburg, set in a marsh dotted with Stonehenge-size chunks of bulldozed industrial buildings. (If it rains, they adjourn to a spot under the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.)</p>
        <p>A few Sundays ago, two teenage boys hacked their way through the weeds and watched two women in midriff-baring T-shirts juggle flaming torches while a tumbler practiced splits on the glass-strewn concrete. A stranger wandered past playing bagpipes, and Ms. Sumner and one of the trombonists tootled over to check him out.</p>
        <p>A Hasidic family walking down by the pier made a detour up onto the concrete, drawn in by the snaky, vaguely klezmer-like strains of a waltz, ''Whack Clown,'' which Mr. Lewis wrote for the memorial of the performance artist Mark Ashwill.</p>
        <p>Initially, the band improvised everything, but it found that structures somehow emerged and congealed. Soon members were writing tunes on purpose.</p>
        <p>''We're dealing with the presence of songs,'' Mr. Moore said, as if discussing an infestation.</p>
        <p>The band even plays a couple of non-original numbers, though neither is a staple of the American band repertoire: a World War II Italian Partisan anthem, ''Ciao Bella,'' and an Indian movie soundtrack hit called ''Disco Bhangra.''</p>
        <p>Not every performance is stellar. At a recent Sunday march through the East Village, starting at the ungodly hour of 10 a.m., the band, including, for the first time, Ms. Fairey's 3-year-old son, Sammy, on toy trumpet, sounded peevish, a brown stew of blats and thumps. The bass drummer, Doug Anson, walked close to cars and banged loudly, setting off their alarms.</p>
        <p>''It's a little early in the morning for us,'' Ms. Sumner conceded afterward.</p>
        <p>The band has faced other problems. Once, Mr. Moore's spats got hooked together and he fell horn first into Avenue A. As he lay helplessly tangled, all his change spilled out of his pockets and children descended on him and stole it.</p>
        <p>Last year, at a Halloween parade in the East Village, he got tangled in his spats again and fell onto Jeremy Obviren, the snare drummer. Fortunately, Mr. Obviren was wearing a foam praying mantis on his head.</p>
        <p>More often than not, though, things turn out as they did on the day of the memorial service for Mr. Ashwill last month. When the band reached Tompkins Square Park, three kindergarten-size girls emerged from the crowd and started dancing and jumping in time to the music.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Mr. Ashwill's former dance partner, DD Dorvillier, walked up and thanked the band tearfully.</p>
        <p>''The first time I heard them, I thought they were really fruity, really crazy,'' she said later. ''But today, as soon as I heard those chords in the brass I started to cry. That piece was like digging your heels in the dirt to take a big shovelful of dirt and throw it over your shoulder.</p>
        <p>''We needed them to play.''</p>
