        <p>One of the more admirable qualities of the Experience Music Project, the $240 million rock 'n' roll museum conceived by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, is its commitment to local musicians and artists.

        <p>One of the more admirable qualities of the Experience Music Project, the $240 million rock 'n' roll museum conceived by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, is its commitment to local musicians and artists. This is evident not just in its memorabilia from artists like Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix, Heart and the Sonics, but also in its centerpiece: a giant sound sculpture made up of 600 guitars strung along the branches of a metal tree rising more than 30 feet into the air.</p>
        <p>On closer examination, little metallic centipedes seem to be perched over the strings of several dozen of the instruments: these are self-playing, self-tuning guitars that have been invented for the project. Throughout the day, guitar picks on mechanical arms strike the strings as computer-controlled dampers press down on the frets, creating eerily beautiful music.</p>
        <p>The sculptor, inventor and composer behind this piece, titled ''If 6 Was 9'' (not just after the Jimi Hendrix song but also after a ratio considered in developing the instruments), is a Seattle resident who has spent his life outside the two local worlds the museum represents: rock and Microsoft. He is known as simply Trimpin, one of Seattle's best-kept secrets, an excitable, gray-bearded, German-born sound artist and recent recipient of a MacArthur Foundation fellowship.</p>
        <p>During a recent visit to Trimpin's Seattle studio, the rooms were covered with the detritus of his more-than-20-year obsession with turning acoustic instruments into sculptures that can be played by motors or by valves that release water, air and even fire. In one corner stood a piano with pistons hanging over each key. Upstairs was an old invention that combines a tuba and a stand-up bass. Notebooks full of brightly colored, heavily annotated diagrams and scores covered the tables. And on the walls hung a dozen one-string prototypes of his mechanical guitar. Trimpin tapped a key on his computer and the picks began clicking over the strings, filling the studio with sound.</p>
        <p>''I see it as a 21st-century player guitar,'' said Trimpin, who is known for his work with Conlon Nancarrow, the Mexico City composer best remembered for creating compositions for player piano too complex to be played by human hands. ''When I was asked to come up with a proposal for the museum, I wanted to do something with strings because I've never worked with strings. And I've never worked with amplified sounds. I've always used natural sounds.''</p>
        <p>The sculpture was built in just five months, with Trimpin working 14 hours a day in his studio. ''I was dealing with hums and interference, which I've never had to deal with before,'' he said. ''I had to build a completely different pick system, because a normal pick has a higher impedance that picks up all the magnetic noises. Then I thought that I could develop a fiber-optic pickup that wouldn't have hums. But I didn't have time to do that.''</p>
        <p>''Even when you think back,'' he went on, ''the basic loudspeaker design is 100 years ago. We have all these new digital recording techniques, but we still need to use a loudspeaker with this heavy coil and magnetic setup. I don't understand why that still exists. I learned from this project that I'm not satisfied with artificial, amplified sounds; when I work on my next project, I want to change them.''</p>
        <p>Another inventor might run out and try to patent the player guitar, the new picking system, the fiber-optic guitar pickup, and the 21st-century loudspeaker. But not Trimpin. Though many of his instruments, designs and ideas could make millions in the instrument-manufacturing and even the toy world, he has never applied for a patent or tried to mass produce anything.</p>
        <p>His goal is simply to combine sound, visuals and movement in new ways and, in the process, modify instruments to extend their repertory beyond human limitations. His guitars, for example, can not only be played in configurations impossible for human hands but, in the space it takes to get from one note to another, they can also switch into a completely different tuning system.</p>
        <p>Trimpin says his interest in redesigning instruments comes from his childhood in the Black Forest in Germany. ''When I got toys for my birthday or Christmas, I had to take them apart first so I could see what's inside and how it works,'' he said. ''And then I could play with it. So there was always this curiosity of how mechanics work.''</p>
        <p>During the visit, Trimpin was busy packing his fire organ so it could be shipped for a performance at the Sound Symposium in Newfoundland. It is a thermodynamic organ that uses a glass flame in a Pyrex tube to produce sound.</p>
        <p>''Normal organ pipes use forced air to make the sound, but here you get warm air rising, and at a certain temperature it creates a much more beautiful, richer sound,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>Trimpin eventually wants to incorporate the fire organ into a multimedia piece that will also use cold water dropping onto heated plates to generate pitch-specific hisses. In addition, the steam that results will be used as a screen for projections.</p>
        <p>Trimpin said that all of his ideas, even that one, evolved out of his childhood experiences. ''The fire organ is based on a big bonfire we had on top of a mountain after carnival every year in the village where I grew up,'' he said. ''You'd put some square wooden discs in a fire until they glowed, then slam them over a ramp and they'd take off and howl into the air.''</p>
        <p>But while village residents were watching these low-tech fireworks, Trimpin was listening to the steam produced by the wet discs and the whistling of their flight. ''I could always hear choirs singing and whole symphony orchestras playing in the sounds created by this tremendous heat,'' he said. ''I always looked forward to going to the bonfire because I could listen to this symphony.''</p>
        <p>Trimpin turned back to his fire organ and continued packing, trying to finish in time to hear another sort of symphony: he had free tickets to James Brown that night. ''I like to go to concerts and galleries and museums,'' he said, ''but when I go to the junkyard I have the same experience because I can fantasize about discovering things. So junkyards and museums and concerts are all on the same level for me: there are inspirations to be found at all of them.''</p>
