        <p>Vice President Al Gore wants more Americans to drive vehicles powered by electricity and to sleep under roofs latticed with solar panels, and today he explained how he would nudge them in that direction: with tax credits of up to $6,000 for buying energy-efficient cars and up to $2,000 for buying houses that meet energy-saving standards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's proposals boil down to a philosophy that says that if the federal government wants Americans to live and travel in a fashion less dependent on oil and kinder to the environment, it should make it worth their while. As president, Mr. Gore said today, he would.</p>
        <p>''When you get the tax credit, then it becomes too good of a deal to pass up,'' Mr. Gore said as he sat on a stack of drywall in the backyard of a house being built with an array of energy-saving devices in this suburb of Columbus. ''Hopefully, over time, that will change the pattern of practice so that these energy-saving options begin to be just the normal way we do things in this country.''</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt that we can save on energy -- and thus reduce pollution dramatically -- by giving these tax cuts to Americans who want to take advantage of them,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides said the ideas the vice president outlined today would represent about $48 billion in lost federal tax revenue and spending over 10 years.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mr. Gore proposed a 10-year, $75 billion package of tax breaks and other measures to motivate utility companies and manufacturers to use more energy-efficient methods to reduce the country's dependence on oil. The vice president was expected on Thursday to make additional proposals that would bring the 10-year price of what he described as a new energy and environmental initiative to much more than $125 billion.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Gore's critics have often painted him as a tree-hugging extremist or a starry-eyed idealist on environmental issues, the vice president has seized on sudden concerns over the country's dependence on oil as an opportunity to dream big environmental dreams. In remarks at a fund-raiser in Washington on Tuesday night, Mr. Gore described this moment as ''an echo'' of the energy crisis of the late 1970's.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Gore spoke today in a suburb that is not only in a swing state for the general election but also in a region of the country hit particularly hard by high gasoline prices.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign and the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas have spent much of the last week trading bitter accusations that resemble the schoolyard chant, ''I know you are, but what am I?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and his aides have asserted that Mr. Bush, as a former oilman who has received large sums of campaign money from oil and gas companies, would be unable to stand up to oil-industry interests. And Mr. Bush's aides, in turn, have combed through the vice president's past proposals and statements for suggestions or evidence that Mr. Gore at times supported higher fuel prices and had his own cozy ties to the oil and gas industry.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Bush's aides complained that the ideas Mr. Gore was promoting were recycled, unrealized proposals by the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>''They're just adding more money,'' said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>That was true of some of Mr. Gore's proposals today, but not of others. Mr. Gore's plan included a tax credit of 20 percent of the cost of home equipment that does not rely on oil, like electric heat pumps, hot water heaters and natural gas heat pumps; a tax credit of up to $1,000 for buying solar water heating systems and $2,000 for solar electricity systems; an unspecified tax credit for consumers who choose utilities in their areas that use cleaner energy sources and financial help for low-income families so that they could  ''weatherize'' their homes and save  energy.</p>
        <p>The biggest tax credits proposed for consumers were those for people who buy vehicles that run at least partly on electricity, or whose fuel efficiency has been dramatically improved in other ways. These credits range from $4,000 for fuel-efficient pickup trucks to $15,000 for fuel-efficient 18-wheel cargo trucks.</p>
