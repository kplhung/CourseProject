        <p>You would think that in an election year, the Supreme Court justices might cooperate with popular efforts to label them liberal or conservative, lining up the big decisions on a political scorecard. After all, the next president may get to appoint one or more new members to the court -- three justices are over 70, four have fought serious illnesses and some might welcome the chance to retire if the new president were likely to appoint a sympathetic successor.</p>
        <p>But in the rich and important term that they finished yesterday, the justices defied any simple political typecasting, proving once again that the court does not simply follow the election returns, and that court-packing is harder than it looks.</p>
        <p>To be sure, there are several areas -- such as the separation of church and state and the scope of federal power -- where the court did divide rigidly into two camps, and in which  future outcomes do hang by one vote.</p>
        <p>For instance, will the court uphold voucher programs that give tax money to parochial schools, deciding that they are not, as some claim, an unconstitutional ''establishment'' of religion in violation of the First Amendment? A clue came in a 6-to-3 ruling yesterday holding that the government may grant computers and other teaching aids to religious schools. Four justices -- Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy -- indicated a likely willingness to uphold voucher schemes, reasoning in an opinion by Justice Thomas that it is ''bigotry'' to exclude ''pervasively sectarian schools from otherwise permissible aid programs.''</p>
        <p>But these four justices do not yet have a clear fifth vote for the constitutionality of vouchers. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor went to great lengths in a separate, but concurring opinion, joined by Justice Stephen Breyer, to caution that the court must still review aid programs carefully to make sure they do not support too much religious indoctrination.</p>
        <p>The power of Congress to enact broad civil rights laws also hangs in a 5-to-4 balance. Earlier this year, the court threw out both a federal lawsuit by a young woman claiming damages after date rape by football players at a state university and a lawsuit by employees claiming age discrimination by a state employer, reasoning in each case that Congress had overstepped its authority in allowing such suits.</p>
        <p>Five members of the court -- Justices Rehnquist, Scalia, O'Connor, Kennedy and Thomas -- have consistently voted for such restrictions of federal power; four -- Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer -- would give more latitude to Congress. The presidential election could tip this balance.</p>
        <p>But in a wide range of other decisions this term, the justices declined to march in neat political lockstep. If the court had voted according to the popular stereotypes of ''liberal'' and ''conservative'' judges, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, who were appointed by President Clinton, would not have disagreed on whether the Constitution's prohibition on retroactive laws required the court to overturn the conviction of a child molester.</p>
        <p>Nor would Justice Scalia, a ''conservative,'' have had occasion on Monday to lecture the more ''liberal'' Justice Breyer on the importance of an undiminished right to trial by jury for a defendant accused of a hate crime.</p>
        <p>The fact that the justices do not vote along simple ideological lines results in unexpected coalitions. For instance, Justices Stevens, Kennedy, Souter and Thomas, all appointed by Republican presidents, and Justice Ginsburg struck down a law requiring television cable companies either to completely scramble, or to take off the air, sexually explicit broadcasts during waking hours. The only other Democratic appointee, Justice Breyer, joined Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor and Scalia in arguing that the restrictions were proper.</p>
        <p>And dissenting in another case, Justices Scalia and Breyer agreed that the Constitution allows a federal agent to squeeze bus passengers' carry-on bags looking for drugs; the other seven justices were convinced this was an illegal search.</p>
        <p>The court's judicial activism last term was also bipartisan. It ruled two federal laws that might be viewed as conservative to be unconstitutional: one limiting smut on cable television and the other giving police more leeway to interrogate suspects without the straitjacket of Miranda warnings. But it also struck down federal laws against gender-motivated violence and age discrimination by the states -- both likely to be favored by liberal constituencies.</p>
        <p>Ruling on state laws, the court struck down ''conservative'' measures that authorized student-led prayers at public high school football games, gave grandparents broad access to their grandchildren over a parent's objection and banned so-called partial-birth abortions. But it also invalidated ''liberal'' state laws forcing the Boy Scouts to admit a gay scoutmaster and giving native Hawaiians preferences in voting for officials in charge of native Hawaiian affairs. And this week, it invalidated the California primary system, which allowed votes across party lines, reasoning that a measure favored by political moderates like Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and Republican Representative Tom Campbell in fact violated political parties' freedom of association.</p>
        <p>The court's influence over the allocation of power and rights in our society is profound, and its power well worth reckoning in the coming election. The president holds sway over not one but two branches of government -- the executive and the judiciary. But this term's decisions should make politicians wary of simple ideological labels.</p>
