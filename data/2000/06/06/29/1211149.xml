        <p>For months, Ivan Y. Misko scraped, spackled and molded until he had properly endowed his bust of Gennadi Karpenko with the mountainous brow of a scholar, the sturdy jaw of a leader and, above all, the forward gaze of a charismatic politician peering into the Belarussian future.</p>

        <p>For months, Ivan Y. Misko scraped, spackled and molded until he had properly endowed his bust of Gennadi Karpenko with the mountainous brow of a scholar, the sturdy jaw of a leader and, above all, the forward gaze of a charismatic politician peering into the Belarussian future.</p>
        <p>As a devoted friend to the late Mr. Karpenko, a physicist and politician, Mr. Misko this spring cast his work in plaster and supervised its transformation into bronze. Now it is almost ready for unveiling at Mr. Karpenko's tomb, a ceremony that when it takes place sometime in July will be a significant political act in this authoritarian state that lies between Russia and Poland.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Karpenko was, until his death on April 6, 1999, one of the most dangerous men in Belarus as the leader of the opposition forces seeking to oust President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karpenko, a deputy speaker of the Parliament disbanded by Mr. Lukashenko in 1996, died abruptly at age 49 of what the medical authorities here said was a brain hemorrhage. Though there is no proof of foul play, the circumstances surrounding Mr. Karpenko's final hours -- he received no serious medical attention for 24 hours after he collapsed and entered a state medical center -- have caused his family to doubt that he died of natural causes.</p>
        <p>''From the very beginning I suspected that he was murdered somehow,'' said his wife, Lyudmila. ''And when other opposition leaders started disappearing months later, it confirmed my suspicions.''</p>
        <p>In a gesture of respect for Mr. Karpenko's advocacy of democracy, the American ambassador, Daniel V. Speckhard, made a private visit to the grave site last year accompanied by Mrs. Karpenko.</p>
        <p>Since the funeral, the pressure on the family has not eased. Mr. Karpenko's son, Dimitri, has been driven from his job in a state enterprise and his family remains under surveillance and harassment from Mr. Lukashenko's security forces.</p>
        <p>''I am afraid for my children,'' Mrs. Karpenko said. ''They don't have a future in this country. We are going to open the monument to Gennadi, and then we are going to leave the country. It is just too hard to live here.''</p>
        <p>As a state artist of the Soviet Union, Mr. Misko spent much of his life lionizing astronauts and other heroes of socialist labor. His studio, at the edge of a leafy courtyard near the center of the capital, is an untidy museum of the socialist realism that flourished under Communism and that Stalin saw as the best means to bend art to the service of the totalitarian state. It became state policy in 1932, the year Mr. Misko was born.</p>
        <p>A barrel-chested sculptor who chiseled President Clinton's profile on a commemorative medallion for his visit here in 1994, Mr. Misko would be the last person to say he is engaging in politics with his art. But the Karpenko bust is unmistakably an act of rebellion against the authoritarianism that exists under Mr. Lukashenko, an admirer of Stalin and the Soviet era.</p>
        <p>''I am doing it for free,'' said Mr. Misko, whose shock of white hair and mischievous eyes always seem to convey more than he says. ''I am not doing it for money -- in fact, no one wants to pay for it. The family does not have the money, and there is no one else to place the order, especially not the state.''</p>
        <p>''He was my friend for a long time,'' Mr. Misko said of Mr. Karpenko.</p>
        <p>As the bronze was being cast last week, the visage of Mr. Karpenko in clay still dominated Mr. Misko's studio, capturing what friends say was the quiet resolve of the man who unified the country's opposition parties little more than a year ago and prepared them to stage a mock presidential election that challenged Mr. Lukashenko's legitimacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lukashenko's presidential term expired last July, though he continues to rule after rewriting the country's Constitution.</p>
        <p>The unveiling of the Karpenko memorial is scheduled for sometime after the Congress of Democratic Forces, a grouping of opposition parties, convenes on July 2 here in the capital. Unless Mr. Lukashenko bans it, the congress aims to unite all opposition parties in a new challenge to the president. The congress, its organizers say, will demand fair elections this fall for a new Parliament and next year for a new president.</p>
        <p>Were Mr. Karpenko still alive, he would certainly have been the leading candidate to challenge Mr. Lukashenko, in the view of most political analysts here. Without him the opposition cannot offer a broadly acceptable leader, said Yevgeny Ogurtsov, a member of the United Civic Party and an editor whose newspaper, The Citizen, was shut down by Mr. Lukashenko in 1996.</p>
        <p>For that reason, Mr. Karpenko's death was deeply disturbing to many here, and in the months that followed, Belarussians were all the more stunned by the assault on most of the remaining opposition leaders.</p>
        <p>In the last year, the political landscape has been wiped clean, says Irina Khalip, an independent journalist who has been arrested and harassed for her coverage of corruption and political abuse under Mr. Lukashenko.</p>
        <p>''All political leaders who might have laid claim to the presidency have either died under suspicious circumstances, like Karpenko, or they have fled in fear of their lives or disappeared,'' she said. ''The remaining ones have been convicted of political crimes with conditions that they cannot participate in the elections, and so today there is almost no opposition figure who could run against Lukashenko.''</p>
        <p>''Nevertheless,'' Ms. Khalip added, ''it is a big mistake for Lukashenko to feel safe, because a new leader will appear.''</p>
        <p>Just as Mr. Karpenko did.</p>
