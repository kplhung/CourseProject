        <p>Following are excerpts from Supreme Court decision overturning a Nebraska law dealing with abortion. The vote in the case, Stenberg v. Carhart, was 5 to 4. The majority opinion was written by Justice Stephen G. Breyer; Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the dissent.</p>
        <p>FROM THE DECISION  By Justice Breyer</p>
        <p>We again consider the right to an abortion. We understand the controversial nature of the problem. Millions of Americans believe that life begins at conception and consequently that an abortion is akin to causing the death of an innocent child; they recoil at the thought of a law that would permit it. Other millions fear that a law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to lives that lack dignity, depriving them of equal liberty and leading those with least resources to undergo illegal abortions with the attendant risks of death and suffering.</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from Supreme Court decision overturning a Nebraska law dealing with abortion. The vote in the case, Stenberg v. Carhart, was 5 to 4. The majority opinion was written by Justice Stephen G. Breyer; Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the dissent.</p>
        <p>FROM THE DECISION  By Justice Breyer</p>
        <p>We again consider the right to an abortion. We understand the controversial nature of the problem. Millions of Americans believe that life begins at conception and consequently that an abortion is akin to causing the death of an innocent child; they recoil at the thought of a law that would permit it. Other millions fear that a law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to lives that lack dignity, depriving them of equal liberty and leading those with least resources to undergo illegal abortions with the attendant risks of death and suffering.</p>
        <p>Taking account of these virtually irreconcilable points of view, aware that constitutional law must govern a society whose different members sincerely hold directly opposing views, and considering the matter in light of the Constitution's guarantees of fundamental individual liberty, this court, in the course of a generation, has determined and then redetermined that the Constitution offers basic protection to the woman's right to choose. We shall not revisit those legal principles. Rather, we apply them to the circumstances of this case.</p>
        <p>Three established principles determine the issue before us. . . .</p>
        <p>First, before ''viability the woman has a right to choose to terminate her pregnancy.''</p>
        <p>Second, ''a law designed to further the state's interest in fetal life which imposes an undue burden on the woman's decision before fetal viability'' is unconstitutional. An ''undue burden is shorthand for the conclusion that a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.''</p>
        <p>Third, ''subsequent to viability, the state in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.''</p>
        <p>We apply these principles to a Nebraska law banning ''partial birth abortion.'' The statute reads as follows:</p>
        <p>''No partial birth abortion shall be performed in this state, unless such procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.'' . . .</p>
        <p>The question before us is whether Nebraska's statute, making criminal the performance of a ''partial birth abortion,'' violates the federal Constitution, as interpreted in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey (1992)  and Roe v. Wade (1973). We conclude that it does for at least two independent reasons.  First, the law lacks any exception ''for the preservation of the health of the mother.''  Second, it ''imposes an undue burden on a woman's ability'' to choose a D [short for ''dilation and evacuation,'' a generic term for abortions performed at 13 weeks or later]. . . .</p>
        <p>The fact that Nebraska's law applies both pre- and postviability aggravates the constitutional problem presented. The state's interest in regulating abortion previability is considerably weaker than postviability. Since the law requires a health exception in order to validate even a postviability abortion regulation, it at a minimum requires the same in respect to previability regulation.</p>
        <p>The quoted standard also depends on the state regulations ''promoting [the state's] interest in the potentiality of human life.'' The Nebraska law, of course, does not directly further an interest ''in the potentiality of human life'' by saving the fetus in question from destruction, as it regulates only a method of performing abortion. Nebraska describes its interests differently. It says the law ''shows concern for the life of the unborn,'' ''prevents cruelty to partially born children,'' and ''preserves the integrity of the medical profession.'' But we cannot see how the interest-related differences could make any difference to the question at hand, namely, the application of the ''health'' requirement.</p>
        <p>Consequently, the governing standard requires an exception ''where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother,'' for this court has made clear that a state may promote but not endanger a woman's health when it regulates the methods of abortion. . . .</p>
        <p>Nebraska further emphasizes that there are no medical studies ''establishing the safety of the partial-birth abortion/D and ''no medical studies comparing the safety of partial-birth abortion/D. . . . Using this law, some present prosecutors and future attorneys general may choose to pursue physicians who use D&amp;E procedures, the most commonly used method for performing previability second trimester abortions. All those who perform abortion procedures using that method must fear prosecution, conviction and imprisonment. The result is an undue burden upon a woman's right to make an abortion decision. We must consequently find the statute unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>FROM THE DISSENT  By Justice Thomas</p>
        <p>In 1973, this court struck down an act of the Texas Legislature that had been in effect since 1857, thereby rendering unconstitutional abortion statutes in dozens of states. As some of my colleagues on the court, past and present, ably demonstrated, that decision was grievously wrong . . .</p>
        <p>Abortion is a unique act, in which a woman's exercise of control over her own body ends, depending on one's view, human life or potential human life. Nothing in our federal Constitution deprives the people of this country of the right to determine whether the consequences of abortion to the fetus and to society outweigh the burden of an unwanted pregnancy on the mother. Although a state may permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a state must do so. . . .</p>
        <p>The standard set forth in the Casey joint opinion has no historical or doctrinal pedigree. The standard is a product of its authors' own philosophical views about abortion, and it should go without saying that it has no origins in or relationship to the Constitution and is, consequently, as illegitimate as the standard it purported to replace. Even assuming, however, as I will for the remainder of this dissent, that Casey's fabricated undue-burden standard merits adherence (which it does not), today's decision is extraordinary. Today, the court inexplicably holds that the states cannot constitutionally prohibit a method of abortion that millions find hard to distinguish from infanticide and that the court hesitates even to describe. . . . In striking down this statute, which expresses a profound and legitimate respect for fetal life and which leaves unimpeded several other safe forms of abortion, the majority opinion gives the lie to the promise of Casey that regulations that do no more than ''express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the woman's exercise of the right to choose'' whether or not to have an abortion. . . .</p>
        <p>In the almost 30 years since Roe, this court has never described the various methods of aborting a second- or third-trimester fetus.  From reading the majority's sanitized description, one would think that this case involves state regulation of a widely accepted routine medical procedure. Nothing could be further from the truth. The most widely used method of abortion during this stage of pregnancy is so gruesome that its use can be traumatic even for the physicians and medical staff who perform it. And the particular procedure at issue in this case, ''partial birth abortion,'' so closely borders on infanticide that 30 states have attempted to ban it. . . .</p>
        <p>There is no question that the State of Nebraska has a valid interest, one not designed to strike at the right itself, in prohibiting partial birth abortion. Casey itself noted that states may ''express profound respect for the life of the unborn.'' States may, without a doubt, express this profound respect by prohibiting a procedure that approaches infanticide, and thereby dehumanizes the fetus and trivializes human life. The A.M.A. has recognized that this procedure is ''ethically different from other destructive abortion techniques because the fetus, normally 20 weeks or longer in gestation, is killed outside the womb.</p>
        <p>The ''partial birth'' gives the fetus an autonomy which separates it from the right of the woman to choose treatments for her own body. . . . The next question, therefore, is whether the Nebraska statute is unconstitutional because it does not contain an exception that would allow use of the procedure whenever ''necessary in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the health of the mother.''</p>
        <p>In Roe and Casey, the court stated that the state may ''regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.'' Casey said that a health exception must be available if ''continuing her pregnancy would constitute a threat'' to the woman. Under these cases, if a state seeks to prohibit abortion, even if only temporarily or under particular circumstances, as Casey says that it may, the state must make an exception for cases in which the life or health of the mother is endangered by continuing the pregnancy. These cases addressed only the situation in which a woman must obtain an abortion because of some threat to her health from continued pregnancy. But Roe and Casey say nothing at all about cases in which a physician considers one prohibited method of abortion to be preferable to permissible methods. Today's majority and Justice O'Connor twist Roe and Casey to apply to the situation in which a woman desires for whatever reason an abortion and wishes to obtain the abortion by some particular method.</p>
        <p>Editors' Note:  June 30, 2000, Friday  A front-page article yesterday described the Supreme Court's decision to strike down a Nebraska law on abortion.</p>
        <p>With the continuation of the article, The Times published excerpts from the majority opinion and from one opinion dissenting. But six other justices also wrote opinions. To provide a fuller account of the range of views on the court in this case, additional excerpts appear today on Pages A20 and A21.</p>
