        <p>Editorial lauds Supreme Court's refusal to block Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba; holds case has hurt image of Miami's Cuban-American community and city's elected leaders; holds anti-Castro lobby has hurt its message by seeming to use child as political prop</p>

        <p>Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy found off the Florida coast last Thanksgiving Day, returned home to Cuba last night after the Supreme Court rejected an emergency request from the child's relatives in Miami to keep him in the United States. It was the proper legal conclusion to a bitter family dispute that dragged on for months and drew international attention. The high court was right not to take the case because there were no important issues of law that had not been resolved by lower courts.</p>
        <p>This page opposed the predawn raid in April by federal immigration agents to remove Elian from the home of his Miami relatives as an unwarranted use of force against citizens who were behaving in a recalcitrant but not violent manner. But we have supported the father's right to regain custody of  the child and to decide where he should live. The relatives had no business blocking the return of the boy to his father simply because they equated paternal custody with delivering him to Fidel Castro.</p>

        <p>Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy found off the Florida coast last Thanksgiving Day, returned home to Cuba last night after the Supreme Court rejected an emergency request from the child's relatives in Miami to keep him in the United States. It was the proper legal conclusion to a bitter family dispute that dragged on for months and drew international attention. The high court was right not to take the case because there were no important issues of law that had not been resolved by lower courts.</p>
        <p>This page opposed the predawn raid in April by federal immigration agents to remove Elian from the home of his Miami relatives as an unwarranted use of force against citizens who were behaving in a recalcitrant but not violent manner. But we have supported the father's right to regain custody of  the child and to decide where he should live. The relatives had no business blocking the return of the boy to his father simply because they equated paternal custody with delivering him to Fidel Castro.</p>
        <p>Despite pandering by politicians to the passions of Miami's Cuban-American community and despite intense community anger over the raid, there was no deadly violence. The legal system provided a rational process and has now produced a just outcome. All the parties were allowed to make their arguments in court, with the federal judges ruling that in this case only the parent could speak for the young boy in making an asylum decision.</p>
        <p>Elian may yet find his way to a normal childhood in his country. The image of the Cuban-American community in Miami, however, has suffered because of its belligerence in disrupting familial ties between father and son. The posturing by Miami's elected leaders in refusing to aid federal authorities was insupportable. Miami city politics have become more divisive than ever.</p>
        <p>On the national scene, the anti-Castro lobby has hurt its message by seeming to use a child as a political prop. Perhaps most harmful to that cause is that many Americans came to sympathize with Elian's father and became more aware of America's outdated policy of isolation toward Cuba. It is perhaps not surprising that just one day before Elian's flight home, the House Republican leaders agreed to end four decades of sanctions on food sales to Cuba. The saga of this Cuban child helped to hasten that shift in policy.</p>
