        <p>''What you see is what you get,'' Britney Spears sang at the Jones Beach Theater on Tuesday night. And what you get from this 18-year-old singer is a big smile, a little voice, gushes of sincerity, hardworking dance routines, shameless advertising and a determination to play both sides of pubescence for all they're worth. To an audience full of squealing little girls, Ms. Spears previewed adolescent romance as a realm where all that matters are a girl's feelings and her wardrobe.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spears, whose two albums have sold 16 million copies in the United States, makes Madonna seem like a tortured artist. She is eager to please and eager to sell both her music and her sponsors' products. Her face on advertising posters greeted concertgoers at the entrance; commercials were shown between sets. Since she is sponsored by both a camera company and dairy farmers, fans could have instant photos taken next to a Britney cutout with a milk mustache.</p>

        <p>''What you see is what you get,'' Britney Spears sang at the Jones Beach Theater on Tuesday night. And what you get from this 18-year-old singer is a big smile, a little voice, gushes of sincerity, hardworking dance routines, shameless advertising and a determination to play both sides of pubescence for all they're worth. To an audience full of squealing little girls, Ms. Spears previewed adolescent romance as a realm where all that matters are a girl's feelings and her wardrobe.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spears, whose two albums have sold 16 million copies in the United States, makes Madonna seem like a tortured artist. She is eager to please and eager to sell both her music and her sponsors' products. Her face on advertising posters greeted concertgoers at the entrance; commercials were shown between sets. Since she is sponsored by both a camera company and dairy farmers, fans could have instant photos taken next to a Britney cutout with a milk mustache.</p>
        <p>But her hits, which reached a nation of young mall shoppers, were what brought the advertisers. Ms. Spears gets her best material from a Swedish pop consortium led by Max Martin. Their songs chug along in minor keys, pumped up with hard-rock guitar chords and punctuated by throaty little moans. The lyrics switch between promises of loyalty and pouty kiss-offs, growing marginally more assertive on Ms. Spears's second album, ''Oops! . . . I Did It Again'' (Jive).</p>
        <p>The songs are often about being lonely or broken-hearted, wishing a lost love would come back. Yet her show keeps her surrounded with perky dancers who are as compliant as a high-school clique, following her moves and sometimes raising her aloft. Her voice, suitable for the lead in a road-show production of ''Annie,'' doesn't often stand on its own; it's carried by backup singers and, possibly, prerecorded harmonies. But she does make sure to moan.</p>
        <p>As scripted by the Swedes, Ms. Spears's main complaint is that people keep telling her that her dresses are too short. Singing ''What U See (Is What U Get),'' which insists that she's faithful even if she likes to dress and dance seductively, she wore glittery jeans and a halter top and clutched the kind of silver pole that strippers use. When she reached the line, ''Take me as I am,'' she twitched her hips in a clear bump and grind. Throughout the show, she kept tearing away baggy clothes to wear navel-baring outfits underneath. But she plays the good girl, not the vamp. The boy who won a  ''Meet Britney'' contest onstage got an arm's-length handshake and a polite ''Nice to meet you.'' With her long blond hair extensions, chesty figure and unfailing smile, Ms. Spears has often been compared to a Barbie doll. During a set that lasted slightly more than an hour, she went through enough costumes and scenarios for a Mattel showroom. She was a little girl in a bedroom full of teddy bears, a fairy tale princess, a sailor-suited U.S.O. entertainer, a hippie goddess, a Catholic-school cutup and a homecoming queen.</p>
        <p>Her finale, of course, was ''Oops! . . . I Did It Again,'' about coyly leading on a would-be boyfriend. Phallic red inflatable columns reared all around her like avenging lip glosses. As she sang its last, taunting line -- ''I'm not that innocent'' -- she descended into a fiery pit, not to be seen again. Equating adult sexuality with hellfire, she doesn't mind as long as it heats up her career.</p>
        <p>Teenypop shows always have a gaggle of opening acts with taped backups, and Ms. Spears brought along three warm-ups. No Authority, four young men in tough-guy black T-shirts, had unctuous love songs and half-hearted choreography; BBMak, who didn't dance, applied 1970's folk-rock strumming and high harmonies to protestations of love. Innosense, a five-woman group, put the moves of a cheerleading squad behind catchy, straightforward come-ons. The tour continues tonight at Jones Beach and at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., on Sunday and Monday.</p>
