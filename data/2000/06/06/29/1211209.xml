        <p>Lia Cupani tugged at the corsage on her wrist as the other graduates pinned on their mortarboards. Gabriel Levine, this year's student speaker, scanned his note card one last time before the strains of ''Pomp and Circumstance'' rose up.</p>
        <p>Then, a hitch.</p>
        <p>''I want my mommy and daddy!'' whimpered Hunter Smaldone.</p>
        <p>You could hardly blame him. He is 4 years old. Yet there he was, with his classmates at Creative Beginnings Children's Center, about to celebrate what has become a milestone in this season of commencements: the preschool graduation.</p>
        <p>In Westport, Conn., the Landmark Academy Preschool gave awards not only for ''Always says please and thank you'' but also for ''Best rester.'' And in Mineola, on Long Island, the Tutor Time Child Care center even put out a yearbook for its young graduates.</p>
        <p>No one, yet, has invited Alan Greenspan to speak. But still, preschool graduations are taking on all the trappings of similar events on college campuses -- the caps and gowns, the diplomas, the grandparents flying in from overseas, the triumphant bubble-blowing at festivities' end.</p>
        <p>At a time when pressure to achieve comes younger and younger -- parents compete to see who walks first, who reads first, who gets into Harvard early -- it only makes sense that each step, no matter how early, takes on more moment. As transitions go, the one to kindergarten might not seem so rough. But preschools across the country say they want to ease it by marking all that has come before -- even if all that's come before is block building, song singing and the A B C's.</p>
        <p>''The tradition is a grown-up thing, but it also gives a child an acquaintance with what is next,'' said Vicki Folds, vice president for early childhood education at Tutor Time, a company in Boca Raton, Fla., that operates 204 preschools nationwide. ''We can't just throw them into a new environment. We have to tell them they are ready for it, they are going to succeed.''</p>
        <p>In Hartsdale, Creative Beginnings held several dress rehearsals to prepare the 4- and 5-year-olds for the big day. Teachers tied 1,000 bright blue balloons into an archway over the blacktop playground behind the school and roped off the surrounding grassy area for the audience.</p>
        <p>As parents warmed up their camcorders on the lawn, the graduates showed off their finery back in the classroom -- a pink tulle dress for Lia, a tuxedo for Daniel Berle. The pint-size mortarboards came with elastics to fasten under the chin, but no one, sighed Josephine Covais, a teacher, wanted to wear them. Elastics are so preschool.</p>
        <p>And indeed, the graduates were feeling cocky.</p>
        <p>''We're free play!'' hollered Emily Mancuso, 5, throwing her fists in the air. ''WE get to make the rules!''</p>
        <p>''Are we going to have snack?'' asked Lia, whose teachers voted her most likely to become a congresswoman.</p>
        <p>''She looks like she's going to a wedding,'' one little girl blurted as Emily Hsu flounced in wearing a poufy white dress.</p>
        <p>The teachers here chose Gabriel to deliver the message from the graduates because he could read, and so he dictated a few brief sentences expressing the graduates' thanks to the school. ''Remember,'' his teacher, Mrs. Covais, whispered into his ear as he reviewed one last time, ''Periods mean 'stop.' ''</p>
        <p>As the graduates lined up for the procession, their teachers reminded them to wait for the music to begin, and advised the girls to hold up their dresses as they walked up the grassy hill. ''Just have fun,'' Mrs. Covais urged. ''Remember, those are only your mommies and daddies out there.''</p>
        <p>The underclassmen marched in first, tied together by a rope. The parents burst into applause, some holding bags of Cheerios brought to calm cranky younger siblings.</p>
        <p>''Dress down now!'' a teacher hissed at Emily Hsu, still carrying the bustle of her dress like a bag of groceries in front of her.</p>
        <p>The graduates sat beaming and more still than any of their parents could ever remember seeing them, as Gabriel read his speech, enunciating syllable by syllable (but remembering to stop for periods). Walking up one by one, they took their diplomas with their right hand and shook the hand of the director, Susan Stevenson, with their left.</p>
        <p>Like most graduations, this one stretched on too long, with four speakers, including two alumni, now elementary school students, who offered wise words about the good and bad things that happen to you after preschool. (Good things: no naps in kindergarten. Bad things: you get homework.) The graduates amused themselves by finding uses for their rolled-up diplomas, as telescopes or bats to hit one another.</p>
        <p>Finally, after Susan Stevenson, the director, bid them ''a great time in kindergarten,'' the graduates rushed into the waiting arms of their parents, greeted with bouquets and shouts of ''We did it!''</p>
        <p>''It squishes your heart,'' said Lia's mother, Imre Cupani, wiping her eyes.</p>
        <p>Much of the effort was for the parents, as Emily's mother, Karen Hsu, acknowledged. A chiropractor, she had canceled all her appointments for the afternoon. ''My clients don't understand,'' she said, ''but I'm really excited.''</p>
        <p>''I don't think she knows the significance,'' Mrs. Hsu added, watching her daughter. ''She just knows she's getting big and she's going to go on the bus. She's excited about getting big, I guess.''</p>
        <p>If all this seems to be taking preschoolers a bit too seriously, those who organize the graduations say the ceremonies work to the opposite effect.</p>
        <p>Parents have become so competitive, and are so bombarded by advice on how their children should be developing, said Dr. Folds at Tutor Time, that they sometimes worry too much. The graduation, she said, is a way of recognizing that every child has achieved. After all, every preschooler graduates cum laude.</p>
        <p>''Parents are looking for children to do more, sooner,'' she said. ''This helps recognize the positive things that are happening. We applaud the joyfulness of the child. We don't want to lose sight of that. We don't want to turn them into adults too quickly.''</p>
        <p>To that, Craig Cupani, Lia's father, could only sigh wistfully from behind his camcorder. ''It's the first big step in life,'' he said. ''Then elementary school, junior high, high school, college. Then she's gone.''</p>
