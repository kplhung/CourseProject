        <p>His tenacious play, effervescent personality, matchless wit and unswerving dedication made him Mr. Net. Yet at a time when a possible Nets renaissance is taking place,  Jayson Williams will not be around to enjoy it.</p>
        <p>Arguably the most charismatic player in the league, Williams, 32, retired yesterday after 10 seasons. His doctors have told him that the broken right leg he sustained in a  collision with Stephon Marbury on April 1, 1999, will never allow him to withstand the rigors of professional basketball again.</p>
        <p>Williams never played after the injury, missing all of last season.</p>
        <p>''This has been a hard choice for me,'' Williams said yesterday in a statement. ''I loved playing basketball. I loved being a Net, and I loved the fans here in New Jersey. I believe strongly in our ownership's commitment to bringing our team up to championship quality and I wanted very much to be a part of that effort. But I know from the pain in my knee and what my physicians have told me that my injuries won't allow me to return.''</p>
        <p>The timing of Williams's decision will likely give the Nets $3.8 million  to sign a free agent this summer. Nets President Rod Thorn said yesterday that the team had not yet been granted the $3.8 million, which would be allotted under the disabled player exception. But the Nets, the National Basketball Association, the players association and Williams's agent, Sal DiFazio, have negotiated  to bring forth the agreement. Also,  Williams's six-year, $86 million contract will probably be removed from the Nets' salary cap total on April 1.</p>
        <p>In return, Williams, who played only 30 games after signing his contract in January 1999, will receive all of the money -- about $60 million -- remaining on the deal.</p>
        <p>Williams is expected to have many opportunities to remain in the spotlight through television appearances and perhaps even broadcasting, and Thorn said the Nets were exploring ways to maintain his involvement with the franchise.</p>
        <p>''Fortunately, you're talking about somebody that does have his foundation, his interest in charities, his interest in broadcasting, in movies,'' DiFazio said. ''There's a life after basketball for Jayson Williams, and it may in some cases be related to basketball. He's been deluged by opportunities in the entertainment industry and broadcasting.''</p>
        <p>Williams, an all-Big East selection during his career at St. John's, was selected in the first round of the 1990 draft by the Phoenix Suns, who traded him to the Philadelphia 76ers. He played two seasons with Philadelphia and, after being traded from Philadelphia in October 1992, Williams played seven seasons with the Nets. After struggling early in his career, he became one of the league's best rebounders, averaging 12 rebounds a game his last four seasons. In 1997-1998 Williams, a 6-foot-10-inch center, averaged 12.9 points and a career-high 13.6 rebounds and was named to the Eastern Conference All-Star team, his only All-Star selection. For his career, Williams averaged 7.3 points and 7.5 rebounds a game.</p>
        <p>''Jayson was a terrific basketball player who played with peak intensity in every game,'' Thorn said. ''During his eight years with the Nets, he became both an integral part of our team and a great favorite with the fans. We will all miss his enthusiasm, his gift for the game, his leadership skills.''</p>
