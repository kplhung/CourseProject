        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy has had discussions with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in recent weeks about the possibility of allowing private companies to manage some of the city's worst schools, mayoral aides said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles said that in weekly meetings, the mayor had been urging Mr. Levy to turn over responsibility for the operation of at least 20 failing schools to private companies..</p>
        <p>''This is a discussion we've been having for a number of weeks now,'' Mr. Coles said yesterday. ''But the chancellor has not given us a full-scale comprehensive proposal on how this would be done.''</p>
        <p>Newsday reported yesterday that Mr. Levy was considering a plan to turn some failing schools into charter schools, which would enable him to turn them over to private management companies. Charter schools are public schools that receive a charter from the state that allows them to be managed by a nonprofit or profit-making organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy's aides would not discuss the plan yesterday. But a spokeswoman for Mr. Levy said he was ''considering many alternatives to improve the performance'' of failing schools.</p>
        <p>''Privatization and chartering are not off the table,'' said the spokeswoman, Pam McDonnell. ''But any specifics at this time would be premature.''</p>
        <p>For several years, Mr. Giuliani has been pushing the Board of Education to privatize aspects of the school system, including summer school programs, custodial services and management of troubled schools. But the board has experimented only with small-scale privatization. Last year District 27 in Queens hired a private company to run its summer school program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coles said the mayor put $60 million into the Board of Education's budget for 2000-2001 to privatize the management of at least 20 percent of the city's 99 most troubled schools, which are known as ''schools under registration review,'' or SURR schools. The experiment would probably be limited to failing schools in the chancellor's district, which is made up of 40 underperforming schools around the city.</p>
        <p>''It's clear that the board has not had any success in turning around these schools,'' Mr. Coles said. ''So it makes all the sense in the world to bring in a private manager with a record of success in turning around schools.''</p>
        <p>One of the city's four charter schools, the Sisulu Children's Academy in Harlem, is run by Victory Schools Inc., a private company. New York State charter school law allows regular public schools to convert to charter schools, but only if the parents of a majority of its students support the change. Under the law, parents also have a say in who manages the school.</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said the union would support the plan if it complied with the law, and if the companies chosen to manage the schools worked with the union.</p>
        <p>''If it's done under the proper laws we will obviously be a part of it,'' Ms. Weingarten said. ''Are these private companies a panacea? Absolutely not. But are we willing, if parents want to try this, to work with it? Of course.''</p>
        <p>Any privatization plan also would need approval from the Board of Education. William C. Thompson Jr., the board president, said yesterday that he could not comment on the plan because he did not know any details. But Terri Thomson, the board member from Queens, said she was intrigued.</p>
        <p>''I would want to see the contracts with the companies and know what exactly they would be responsible for,'' she said. ''But I'm open to the idea.''</p>
