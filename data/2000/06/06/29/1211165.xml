      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Standing above an immense crowd in Mexico City's central square recently, Francisco Labastida, the governing party's presidential candidate, kept giving his followers, over and over, a single message.</p>
        <p>''We are going to win,'' Mr. Labastida intoned. ''We are going to win.''</p>
        <p>In fact, it is not clear, just days before the vote on Sunday, that Mr. Labastida, the candidate of the long dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, is going to win, although he may.</p>
        <p>Even at that big rally, his supporters were oddly dispassionate. Most were brought in from out of town by bus and hurriedly left after he spoke, even skipping a free concert by Juan Gabriel, one of Mexico's most popular singers.</p>
        <p>The final opinion polls, published last week, show Mr. Labastida in a tie with Vicente Fox, the right-of-center opposition candidate. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leftist contender, was trailing well behind, and millions of voters were still undecided. By law, campaigning ended today.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks PRI leaders, sensing this softness in their once rock-hard support, have mobilized all their machinery and myriad links to the government in a blistering campaign against Mr. Fox, swaying the press and tarnishing him with accusations that he took illegal campaign donations from foreigners.</p>
        <p>No one knows how the voters will react to the nasty turn in the campaign. Never before have Mexicans faced a such a close contest under an election agency with enhanced powers to ensure an accurate tally.</p>
        <p>Enrique Jackson, a leading PRI lawmaker, electrified a congressional hearing on June 21 by displaying a series of checks that he said proved that Mr. Fox had received donations from people and companies in Belgium and, far worse, the United States, Mexico's historical adversary. Campaign laws prohibit funds from businesses and foreigners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson said the checks showed that Mr. Fox was backed by ''powerful foreign groups that have an appetite for our country.''</p>
        <p>The allegation was made hours before Mr. Fox had a long-scheduled prime-time interview on Televisa, the main national television network, and he spent much of his appearance parrying questions.</p>
        <p>In fact, the checks that Mr. Jackson presented did not indicate the money trail from overseas to the Fox campaign that he described. One check was written a year ago, before the campaign was officially under way.</p>
        <p>Miguel Hakim, a businessman whose company was said to have made contributions, produced documents to show that his transactions were not donations to Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox filed a defamation suit today against the PRI, but his denials have been less potent in the press than Mr. Jackson's allegations.</p>
        <p>The PRI came down hard on Ramiro Berron Lara, an engineer from Petroleos Mexicanos, the state-owned petroleum company better known as Pemex. He complained in the press that his superiors had tried to make him campaign for Mr. Labastida during working hours.</p>
        <p>At a new conference, the director of Pemex, Rogelio Montemayor, a PRI politician, denied that the company had leaned on any employee to back Mr. Labastida. He described Mr. Berron as a problem employee who was facing disciplinary action for ''distributing pornography'' on the company's Internet network.</p>
        <p>Shaken, Mr. Berron responded by showing a list on which he was assigned to register 10 Pemex employees to vote for Mr. Labastida. He said the ''pornography'' was a joke that a friend had sent on the Web, and wondered why his superiors were reading his e-mail.</p>
        <p>In the following days, workers at one Pemex refinery complained to the newspaper Reforma that they were required to present current PRI party credentials and pledge help for Mr. Labastida to ensure their jobs and benefits.</p>
        <p>Monitoring by the Federal Elections Institute, the government agency that is organizing the election, showed that the broadcast media had shifted sharply in favor of Mr. Labastida at the end of the campaign. While the two major national television networks remained more balanced, elections officials said, the media in the provinces, where the hottest battle between Mr. Labastida and Mr. Fox is being waged, strongly colored the news to benefit the PRI candidate.</p>
        <p>In a few cases coverage of Mr. Fox's campaign faced suppression. Josh Tuynman, the national editor of Mexico City's English-language newspaper, The News, said he resigned last week in protest over instructions from the pro-PRI publishers to play down any stories about Mr. Fox.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox's campaign has galvanized a diverse range of Mexicans who want what they refer to, with near-religious fervor, as ''the change,'' an end to the PRI rule. His followers' spontaneous vigor showed at the huge rally that Mr. Fox held last weekend in that same vast plaza in downtown Mexico City. His campaign slogan is a simple ''Now!'' describing the time when his voters want to be done with the PRI.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fox has made problems for himself. He raised doubts about his qualities as a statesman with a show of stubbornness in a discussion with the two other leading candidates on live television in May, a day his supporters call ''Black Tuesday.''</p>
        <p>Probably his most serious error was his failure to lure more support from Mr. Cardenas, who opposes the PRI from the left. Mr. Fox grew impatient with Mr. Cardenas's resistance to his overtures and lashed him a number of times with his country-talking tongue, making it more difficult for Mr. Cardenas's voters to cross over.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardenas, in his own teeming closing rally in the Mexico City square last Sunday, echoed the PRI's accusations about Mr. Fox's campaign finances and called him a liar and an ''electoral delinquent.'' He said hardly an unkind word about Mr. Labastida.</p>
