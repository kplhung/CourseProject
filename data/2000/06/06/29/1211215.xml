        <p>The strikingly different reactions to the Supreme Court's ruling on abortion today underscore how Vice President Al Gore is trying mightily to catapult the court into a front-and-center issue in the presidential campaign, while Gov. George W. Bush wants the matter to fade from the political horizon.</p>
        <p>Soon after the court announced its 5-to-4 decision striking down Nebraska's ban on the type of abortion that opponents call partial-birth abortion, Mr. Gore upended a planned talk in Blacklick, Ohio, about the environment and energy, and instead opened his remarks by warning that the unexpected closeness of the vote demonstrated the importance of electing a president who would pick justices who would protect abortion rights. He said nothing about the procedure addressed by the court.</p>

        <p>The strikingly different reactions to the Supreme Court's ruling on abortion today underscore how Vice President Al Gore is trying mightily to catapult the court into a front-and-center issue in the presidential campaign, while Gov. George W. Bush wants the matter to fade from the political horizon.</p>
        <p>Soon after the court announced its 5-to-4 decision striking down Nebraska's ban on the type of abortion that opponents call partial-birth abortion, Mr. Gore upended a planned talk in Blacklick, Ohio, about the environment and energy, and instead opened his remarks by warning that the unexpected closeness of the vote demonstrated the importance of electing a president who would pick justices who would protect abortion rights. He said nothing about the procedure addressed by the court.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Bush made no mention of the broader makeup of the court, though he did upbraid the justices for not upholding the right to ban what he called ''the brutal practice'' of the procedure opponents call partial-birth abortion.</p>
        <p>The contrasting strategies -- and remarks from the two rivals -- reflect differing political imperatives. The Bush strategy is to make the abortion issue go away, and, for his campaign, the timing of today's ruling is not propitious. The last thing the Republicans want one month before their nominating convention is another spectacle that turns rancorous over abortion. Not only that, the ruling comes as Mr. Bush is mulling whether he dares pick a running mate who favors abortion rights and how he can finesse the issue in the party platform.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore wants to do whatever he can to keep the matter alive -- and paint Republicans as riven by internecine squabbles over abortion. In fact, Gore officials have been waiting gleefully for months in anticipation of today's decision.</p>
        <p>''This is the worst news that the Bush campaign could get,'' said Ann Stone, national chairwoman of the Republicans For Choice PAC.</p>
        <p>The closeness of the ruling, Ms. Stone said, gave Mr. Gore a fresh hook to declare that abortion rights may be endangered, and to shore up his sagging support from women.</p>
        <p>Richard N. Bond, the former Republican Party chairman who for years has counseled the party not to let itself split over abortion, said the best thing Mr. Bush could do was to keep a low profile on the issue.</p>
        <p>''They'll try to paint Bush as risky, extremist, out of touch, intolerant,'' Mr. Bond said of Democrats. ''I don't think Bush is going to take the bait on this. What can a presidential candidate do about a Supreme Court decision?''</p>
        <p>As if on cue, Mr. Gore put out fresh bait. He seized on the ruling -- and another that gives states greater leeway to restrict anti-abortion demonstrations outside health clinics -- and tried to reignite the abortion issue in the Republican Party. For months, in speech after speech, the vice president has warned that religious conservatives like Patrick J. Buchanan and Jerry Falwell would ratify prospects for the bench if Mr. Bush is elected.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Gore said: ''The next president will nominate at least three and probably four, perhaps four, justices to the Supreme Court. One extra vote on the wrong side of those two issues would change the outcome and a woman's right to choose would be taken away.''</p>
        <p>Specifically, Mr. Gore recalled that Mr. Bush has said he respects Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, both of whom were dissenters in the decision today.</p>
        <p>On Air Force II tonight on a flight from Columbus, Ohio, to New York, Mr. Gore stepped up his attack, asserting that Mr. Bush was determined to overturn Roe v. Wade, which affirms a woman's right to an abortion.</p>
        <p>''His views about choice are really quite extreme,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>President Clinton was also on script, asserting at a news conference here that the court's stand on abortion was ''very much in the balance, depending on what appointments are made in the next four years.''</p>
        <p>It was no surprise that Mr. Bush, in his remarks, failed to mention the prospect of vacancies on the Supreme Court. While conservative groups have trumpeted the balance of the court as a high-stakes voting issue, Mr. Bush almost never raises it. He does not want to put off moderate and swing voters who may support abortion rights. He also knows, perhaps, that usually only the most partisan voters think about the makeup of the court.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Bush told supporters in Cleveland, ''I hope to be able to come up with a law that meets the constitutional scrutiny. And, unlike Al Gore, I pledge to fight for a ban on partial-birth abortion.''</p>
        <p>The court's ruling is discouraging for Mr. Bush and many Republicans not only because it gives Mr. Gore another rationale to talk about the court. In addition, the Republicans' embrace in the last few years of eliminating the so-called partial-birth procedure allowed the party to maintain its anti-abortion position in a way that is more palatable to many voters than suggesting overturning the Supreme Court's constitutional rationale allowing abortion. Even many Democrats who favor abortion rights tell pollsters they object to the ''partial-birth'' procedure.</p>
        <p>But with today's decision, it may be difficult for politicians like Representative Rick Lazio, the Republican who is running for the Senate from New York, to declare that he favors abortion rights but voted to prohibit some late-term abortions.</p>
        <p>''It will no longer be credible for politicians to claim to be pro-choice while supporting these abortion bans,'' said Janet Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, which represented the doctor in the Nebraska case.</p>
        <p>Another complication is that some Republicans have already begun debating whether they should keep language in the party platform that applauds efforts ''to sign into law an end to partial-birth abortions.''</p>
        <p>In addition to energizing Democrats, the ruling today may embolden conservatives, some of whom want Mr. Bush, like Mr. Gore, to turn it into a rallying cry to discuss the court itself. But in their determination that Mr. Bush capture the White House, they are reluctant to press him to be outspoken on the issue.</p>
        <p>''I would like him to aggressively criticize the decision and to say how important it is that we have judges who respect innocent human life,'' said Phyllis Schlafly, the prominent abortion opponent.</p>
        <p>Asked if Mr. Bush should raise the abortion issue more, Ms. Schlafly said, ''I don't know that he has to make it the first thing he talks about at every stop. There's so much to talk about.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Bill Graves of Kansas put it this way: ''Many Republicans are prepared to put aside differences on abortion and other issues in exchange for the greater good: the election of George Bush as president.''</p>
