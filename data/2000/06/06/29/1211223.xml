        <p>When the House finally voted yesterday morning to require secret campaign slush funds to disclose their donors, the margin of victory was huge. It was hard to remember that this very bill was narrowly defeated two weeks ago and belittled by foes as something the public did not care about. In trying to combat this supposedly unwanted measure, Representative Tom DeLay and the Republican leadership cooked up a sham alternative that was so punitive toward unions and violative of the privacy rights of nonpolitical groups that their own members could not swallow it. In the end, Mr. DeLay had no choice but to get out of the way and allow a vote on reform or be stampeded by fellow Republicans.</p>
        <p>The measure passed by the House in a post-midnight session yesterday would stop a new, particularly indefensible form of campaign abuse -- the spread of tax-exempt groups created under Section 527 of the tax code to raise money from secret sources and spend it on campaign ads. Mr. DeLay has created his own secret groups and harvested uncounted sums for the campaign. Some supporters of Gov. George W. Bush paid for ads attacking Senator John McCain in March, but they were eventually found out. A spectrum of groups from the Sierra Club to various right-to-life organizations were also raising money for ads under the Section 527 rubric.</p>

        <p>When the House finally voted yesterday morning to require secret campaign slush funds to disclose their donors, the margin of victory was huge. It was hard to remember that this very bill was narrowly defeated two weeks ago and belittled by foes as something the public did not care about. In trying to combat this supposedly unwanted measure, Representative Tom DeLay and the Republican leadership cooked up a sham alternative that was so punitive toward unions and violative of the privacy rights of nonpolitical groups that their own members could not swallow it. In the end, Mr. DeLay had no choice but to get out of the way and allow a vote on reform or be stampeded by fellow Republicans.</p>
        <p>The measure passed by the House in a post-midnight session yesterday would stop a new, particularly indefensible form of campaign abuse -- the spread of tax-exempt groups created under Section 527 of the tax code to raise money from secret sources and spend it on campaign ads. Mr. DeLay has created his own secret groups and harvested uncounted sums for the campaign. Some supporters of Gov. George W. Bush paid for ads attacking Senator John McCain in March, but they were eventually found out. A spectrum of groups from the Sierra Club to various right-to-life organizations were also raising money for ads under the Section 527 rubric.</p>
        <p>The Senate is due to vote on the bill today, and a similar lopsided tally is possible. A nearly identical measure was already approved, 57 to 42. But some senators who voted no last time under pressure from Trent Lott and Mitch McConnell are now worried about being punished in November by voters who have begun to pay attention to campaign reform as an issue.</p>
        <p>The Senate needs to act quickly, since every day of delay guarantees that more truckloads of secret money will be harvested by the slush fund organizations.</p>
        <p>The rush to be on the right side of this issue proves several things. When there is a clear up-or-down vote on campaign reform, reform wins. Opponents have to resort to trickery to avoid a vote, because they know that lawmakers cannot afford to be against something desired by the public. The other lesson is that bipartisanship can carry the day against an entrenched Republican leadership. Mr. DeLay and Mr. Lott have always looked petty and highhanded in opposing sound reform backed by a broad spectrum of the members of Congress.</p>
        <p>Three Republicans -- Representatives Christopher Shays of Connecticut, Michael Castle of Delaware and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina -- came together to work with the Democrats, led by Martin Meehan of Massachusetts, to make an unbeatable combination. Lloyd Doggett of Texas, a Democrat who at times tried to use the issue for partisan advantage, played a constructive role in the end. In the Senate, Mr. McCain has gotten crucial support from another Republican, Olympia Snowe of Maine. They have joined in their efforts with two Democrats, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Whatever happens, campaign reform will not go away. It will be important to remember that the bill requiring disclosure of secret slush funds was dismissed two weeks ago by many reputable pundits and lawmakers as having no chance. It now could be signed by President Clinton in the next couple of weeks. The same ''experts'' have also said that a soft-money ban -- ending the practice of huge unregulated sums contributed by corporations, unions and rich donors to political parties -- also has no chance. If everyone feels that way, the leaders should let there be an up-or-down vote. If that happens, reform will win again.</p>
