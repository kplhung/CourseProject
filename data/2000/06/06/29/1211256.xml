        <p>Jeff Tarango's reputation as the menace to high society at the All England Lawn Tennis Club continued today when he refused to shake the hand of Paul Goldstein after his loss because of what he termed ''bush league'' gamesmanship.</p>
        <p>Goldstein, widely respected on the ATP Tour as a gentleman, felt himself cramp and called for a trainer before Tarango served at 9-10 in a long and tense fifth set. Although it is well within the rules for Goldstein to receive treatment, Tarango thought the timing was too convenient.</p>

        <p>Jeff Tarango's reputation as the menace to high society at the All England Lawn Tennis Club continued today when he refused to shake the hand of Paul Goldstein after his loss because of what he termed ''bush league'' gamesmanship.</p>
        <p>Goldstein, widely respected on the ATP Tour as a gentleman, felt himself cramp and called for a trainer before Tarango served at 9-10 in a long and tense fifth set. Although it is well within the rules for Goldstein to receive treatment, Tarango thought the timing was too convenient.</p>
        <p>''Of course he was faking the injury,'' said Tarango, who lost his second-round match to Goldstein, a fellow former Stanford player, by 3-6, 6-2, 5-7, 6-2, 12-10. ''He was fine. Cramping is no excuse to get a trainer. I thought it was bush league. It's my call whether I want to shake a guy's hand or not.''</p>
        <p>After winning on his fifth match point, Goldstein walked toward Tarango, who stalked to his chair.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'You don't want to shake my hand?' '' Goldstein said. ''He said, ''Why don't you call the trainer before you serve?' ''</p>
        <p>After the crowd jeered the departing Tarango, the 23-year-old Goldstein lifted his arms in appreciation for the fans' support. But the incident marred his moment.</p>
        <p>''I'd be lying if I said it didn't,'' Goldstein said. ''I really feel comfortable in the way I handled everything, and I don't feel like I did anything unethical.''</p>
        <p>That was the general consensus. Neither tour officials nor players who were asked criticized Goldstein's decision to call a trainer.</p>
        <p>Tarango, 31, has been viewed as a cantankerous player for years. But he has been at his most outrageous at Wimbledon. In 1995, Tarango's wife slapped a chair umpire after he lost a match, which prompted the club to ban him for the 1996 event.</p>
        <p>Smashnova Hit With Fine</p>
        <p>Anna Smashnova of Israel angrily hit a ball at her opponent's husband during her match today, but struck a female spectator instead.</p>
        <p>Smashnova, who defeated Katalin Marosi-Aracama of Hungary in three sets in the second-round match, will be fined, tournament organizers said.</p>
        <p>The spectator who was hit, a Briton in her 30's, didn't require medical treatment, and Smashnova apologized to her.</p>
        <p>Smashnova, 23, hit a ball at her opponent's husband, Andreas Aracama. ''I was provoked,'' she said. ''He was laughing and clapping at mistakes.''</p>
        <p>''All I said to my wife was 'vamos,' which means 'let's go' in Spanish,'' the Argentine Aracama said.</p>

        <p>It's Good to Be Back</p>
        <p>After five years, Martina Navratilova returned to Wimbledon today as she took Court 18 to play doubles with Mariaan de Swardt.</p>
        <p>''Of course, it was fantastic to be out there again,'' Navratilova said after a three-set victory.</p>
        <p>Her return was not fueled by a desire to break Billie Jean King's record of 20 titles (singles, doubles and mixed doubles) here.</p>
        <p>''The first time I thought about the 20 titles is when I read about it in the newspaper,'' said Navratilova, who has won 19 titles here and is also entered in mixed doubles.</p>
        <p>Moving Right Along</p>
        <p>Although they have been a maligned group in the past, the same young American men who have been playing in the shadow of Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras are doing well at Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>With victories today, 56th-ranked Jan-Michael Gambill, 76th-ranked Paul Goldstein and 99th-ranked Justin Gimelstob made the third round.</p>
