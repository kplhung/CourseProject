        <p>Once there were few places in Africa as grim as Uganda, now there are few as hopeful.

        <p>Once there were few places in Africa as grim as Uganda, now there are few as hopeful. And the man who claims the credit is campaigning hard for voters to reward him in perhaps an odd way: He wants them to admit that Uganda is still backward and not yet ready to open up to political parties.</p>
        <p>President Yoweri Museveni is balder and bulkier than when he was a bush fighter, his once-brilliant reputation dulled recently at home and abroad. But he is still the man who brought Uganda back and did so with a certain steady charm -- on full display the other day when a group of college students heckled him for more than 20 minutes as he tried to give a speech.</p>
        <p>''Give us a chance to talk,'' he said to the hecklers at Makerere University here. He leaned back and scratched his nose patiently, waiting for quiet. ''That's not how democracy works,'' he said. ''Democracy works by hearing and then deciding in a calm way.''</p>
        <p>For the past few months Mr. Museveni, 56, has been lecturing not only students but all Ugandans on his version of democracy. And on Thursday voters will decide between two political systems: whether to continue with the ''Movement,'' which Mr. Museveni champions, or switch to a multiparty system, outlawed since Mr. Museveni fought his way to power in 1986 after two violent decades.</p>
        <p>The Movement is what Mr. Museveni calls a no-party state. It is an umbrella group with the goal of uniting all Ugandans to which all Ugandans theoretically belong -- its symbol is a big yellow bus. His argument is that political parties divide Ugandans by ethnicity and religion -- and that those splits gave rise to leaders like Idi Amin and Milton Obote, whose reigns ended the lives of tens of thousands of Ugandans. Now, even after 14 years under his rule, Mr. Museveni says Uganda has still not matured enough politically or economically for the return of political parties.</p>
        <p>''We tried having a lot of parties but we failed,'' he said in Luganda, the language of Uganda's largest ethnic group, the Baganda, at a recent rally just outside Kampala. ''We messed up with bad leadership. It's up to you people to decide whether you want to move with the Movement or move with the bad.''</p>
        <p>But a growing column of opponents say the Movement is becoming a one-party state in disguise. Some go so far as to call Mr. Museveni its new-style dictator. Under law, political parties can exist in name, but they cannot hold rallies or conventions or field candidates for office. Real democracy, opponents say, requires more than one political party.</p>
        <p>''It's an excuse, a pretext,'' said Paul Ssemogerere, leader of the Democratic Party and a former presidential candidate against Mr. Museveni. ''You have ethnic divides in America. When Dukakis ran for president, the Greek community was enthusiastic.''</p>
        <p>''You have WASP's, the Jewish vote, the Latino vote, the black vote,'' he added. ''But is that an argument against democracy? If anything, it is a point for democracy that you are able to give voice to all communities. That is the beauty of democracy.''</p>
        <p>There is little doubt how this referendum will turn out. Mr. Ssemogerere and other leading opposition figures have called for a boycott, and their rallies are filled with people who say they will not vote. So it seems certain that the Movement -- headed by a still-popular Mr. Museveni -- will win.</p>
        <p>But with elections for president and Parliament coming next year, the real questions will be Mr. Museveni's margin of victory and the percentage of Uganda's 9.6 million registered voters (the total population is about 23 million) who come out to vote. The results will give both Mr. Museveni and his opponents vital clues for the national mood as they focus on the contests next year.</p>
        <p>Still, the referendum comes at a telling time for Uganda and in some ways Africa itself. To the nation's credit, foreign diplomats and other observers say, the peaceful campaign in Uganda contrasts sharply with Zimbabwe, led by a long-serving former guerrilla fighter.</p>
        <p>But at a time of so much pessimism about conflict and corruption around Africa, Mr. Museveni has been campaigning as his image abroad -- and with many of his own constituents -- has hit a low because of his nation's participation in the war in Congo. Mr. Museveni has for years been considered one of Africa's most progressive leaders. He liberalized the economy, invested in the infrastructure and in education and stressed African self reliance. He stood first among a ''new breed'' of African leaders praised several years ago by President Clinton (all of whom subsequently dragged their nations into war).</p>
        <p>But in August 1998, he and his neighbor to the south, Rwanda, supported rebels seeking to overthrow Congo's president, Laurent Kabila. Even if Uganda can convince the world that its reasons are good -- rebels who attack Uganda are based in Congo -- it has been harder to justify its behavior. Soldiers are accused of rank profiteering, dealing in diamonds, timber and gold.</p>
        <p>Worse, troops from Uganda and Rwanda have themselves clashed three times in the Congolese city of Kisangani -- most recently this month when both sides rained down shells indiscriminately, killing at least 600 people, mostly civilians, according to aid groups. Even the United States, often accused of being too lenient with Uganda, strongly condemned Mr. Museveni.</p>
        <p>''Congo has to some extent caused his performance to be re-evaluated,'' said one Western diplomat here, who asked to be anonymous.</p>
        <p>Though the result of the referendum does not seem in doubt, Mr. Museveni has been campaigning ferociously. He has visited nearly all of Uganda's 45 districts and recently  has spent hours on radio programs answering call-in questions.</p>
        <p>While the referendum is supposed to be between two systems, Mr. Museveni has made it very much about himself and his performance. He reels off the accomplishments not of a political system but of his government: providing more electricity, making primary education essentially free, opening the economy to foreign investors.</p>
        <p>He jokes that life has improved so much that poor farmers use mobile phones while hoeing their fields. He says that the work is far from done, and that continuing the Movement is the only way to keep improving.</p>
        <p>But his opponents say that the glass of Uganda is really half empty. Poverty and unemployment remain high. The Congo war is unpopular. Mr. Museveni, they say, gets more autocratic each year. (He may run for only one more five-year term.) He seems tolerant, they say, but that disguises a harder side. Several protesters at Makerere were arrested and beaten up.</p>
        <p>From students in Makerere to clerks in small towns, Ugandans themselves do not seem overwhelmingly excited about the referendum, now that the nation has become accustomed to voting. Turnout to civic education classes has been low. Many Ugandans do not see their choice as clear as either Mr. Museveni or his opponents portray it.</p>
        <p>At a rally for the Democratic Party, Edith Namutebi, 22, said she liked Mr. Museveni but not the Movement, which she said is not open enough. So she will not be voting.</p>
        <p>For many young people like her, the evils of Uganda's past are only a hazy memory. Just shy of half all Ugandans are under the age of 15, nearly all born since Mr. Museveni became president.</p>
