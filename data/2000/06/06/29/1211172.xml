        <p>When the National Hockey League's restricted and unrestricted free agents begin shopping for contract offers on Saturday, there will be one fewer member of the group than the players association had hoped.</p>
        <p>Left behind will be Aleksei Yashin, the former captain of the Ottawa Senators, who missed last season because of a contract dispute. An arbitrator ruled yesterday that Yashin owes the Senators one more season on a contract that would have been completed last season had he chosen to report.</p>
        <p>''If a player chooses not to play at all, then that is the player's decision,'' wrote the arbitrator, Lawrence T. Holden Jr. ''What the full performance concept requires is that the player render performance for the full term of years specified . . . without illegally holding out if the player wants to obtain the negotiated benefit of free agency.''</p>
        <p>Holden will rule next month on a further demand, by the Senators and the N.H.L., that Yashin owes the team $7 million in damages. He was scheduled to earn $3.6 million last season but his agent, Mark Gandler, told the Senators last fall that Yashin wanted a contract extension for two more seasons beyond 1999-2000 for $23 million before reporting.</p>
        <p>After being suspended by the Senators, Yashin practiced in Europe and played with the Russian team in the world tournament in May. Yashin, 26 years old and a six-year veteran, was runner-up for the Hart trophy as most valuable player in 1998-99 when he scored 44 goals in 82 games.</p>
        <p>Neither Gandler nor the Senators nor the N.H.L. returned calls requesting comment yesterday. The Senators will hold a news conference today. The players association, in a statement, said it disagreed with the decision, particularly because the arbitrator based his finding on agreements between John Ziegler, the former president of the league, and Alan Eagleson, the former executive director of the union.</p>
        <p>Eagleson was deposed as union boss and served time in a Canadian prison for some of his activities while in power. Ziegler was forced to resign by team owners following a players strike in 1992.</p>
        <p>''This case was not about whether Aleksei should or should not have played during the 1999-2000 season,'' said Ian Pulver, a lawyer for the union. ''This was a case about whether Aleksei owes another year on his contract.''</p>
        <p>It is the second major decision by this arbitrator in a week. Last Thursday, Holden ruled for the union and against the league in the case of Mike Van Ryn, a junior player who was drafted two years ago by the Devils. Holden declared Van Ryn an unrestricted free agent because he was 21 years old and no longer a college student, as he was when the Devils drafted him.</p>
        <p>The union said it did not know if it would appeal the Yashin decision. Although the ruling could have a long-term, chilling effect on the leverage of players, it is likely to help resolve the Yashin situation in the short term, to the benefit of both the player and the team. Yashin is unlikely to return to Ottawa, but the Senators can trade his rights.</p>
        <p>Because Yashin is less than 31 years old, he would have had limited mobility, even as a free agent, because he would have fallen into the restricted category. Any team holding his rights -- Ottawa, at the moment -- could have kept him by matching another salary offer or could accept up to five first-round draft choices as compensation.</p>
        <p>A club dealing for him now, following the arbitrator's decision, would be free to accept his contract as is while extending it at a higher rate, as Yashin and his agent requested before last season.</p>
        <p>Although the Senators won a point against Yashin through the arbitration, their roster was weaker than it might have been. They lost to Toronto in the first round of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>The implications of yesterday's decision for hockey and other sports are unclear. The league said no new policy was set. In summarizing the position of the Senators, the arbitrator wrote: ''The Club argues that once a player enters into a binding contract, the player should have as much of an obligation to fulfill it as a club has. The club asks why should a player obtain the benefits of free agency without fulfilling his contractual obligations.''</p>
