        <p>Judy Angelo Cowen, a photographer who specialized in portraits of children, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 83 and had homes in Manhattan and Elberon, N.J.</p>
        <p>Born Judy Bach in Manhattan, Ms. Cowen was educated at the Dana Hall School and Pine Manor College in Massachusetts. After the death of her husband, Lt. Harry Angelo, a member of the United States 30th Infantry Division who was killed in 1944 at the battle of St. Lo in Normandy, Ms. Cowen began experimenting with photography, using as subjects her young son and his cousins. By the early 1950's, she had built her own darkroom, where she worked year round.</p>
        <p>During the next decade, her portraiture expanded to the children of celebrities and the socially prominent, and for the next 30 years she traveled to sittings across the United States. Her work, in which children were allowed to roam freely in their own element, was hailed for its subtlety and eloquence.</p>
        <p>In 1962 she married Arthur Cowen Jr., the chairman of the securities firm Cowen &amp; Company. Mr. Cowen died in 1986.</p>
        <p>She is survived by a son, John M. Angelo of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Lorie Cowen Levy of Irvington, N.Y., and Jill Cowen of Manhattan; a stepson, Tony Cowen of Manhattan; eight grandchildren; and a sister, Carol Gruntal of Westchester, N.Y.</p>
