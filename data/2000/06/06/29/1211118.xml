        <p>WHEN 9-year-old B.J. Pinchbeck could not find a good Web site to help him with his science project, he and his father decided to build one. Four years later, B.J. Pinchbeck's Homework Helper (www.bjpinchbeck.com) has become an indispensable bookmark for many middle-schoolers and their parents. The site, operated by DiscoverySchool.com, has amassed more than 580 links organized by subject and B.J. has become a kind of Stephen Jay Gould for preteenagers.</p>
        <p>B.J. is now 13, an age at which popularity can be a double-edged sword. He receives between 20 and 40 e-mail messages a day asking for help, even on days when he would rather be in-line skating or playing Age of Empires online.</p>

        <p>''It's kind of hard,'' he said. ''It's getting frustrating, particularly in the summer.'' The reach of the Web means that he now gets e-mail from countries where students do not get a two-month vacation. And, his father reminds him, he is receiving a lot more e-mail from American students in summer school. ''Yes,'' he said a little wearily. ''That's another thing we have to consider.''</p>
