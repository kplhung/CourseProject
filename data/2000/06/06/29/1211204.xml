        <p>The New York State Banking Department released new rules yesterday meant to prevent the abuses of high-cost loans that have victimized thousands of homeowners.</p>
        <p>Several consumer and housing groups, protesting the regulations as far too weak, briefly disrupted the presentation at the state banking board meeting in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The rules, which the board is expected to adopt in the next few days, would make New York the second state to regulate so-called predatory lenders. The first was North Carolina, which enacted a law last year.</p>
        <p>New York's superintendent of banking, Elizabeth McCaul, said that while many high-cost lenders help people who have limited credit ratings, ''this regulation makes clear that abusive, predatory lending practices will not be tolerated.''</p>
        <p>Predatory lenders typically use high-pressure tactics to talk homeowners into exorbitant loans that often force them into bankruptcy or foreclosure. The most frequent victims are the elderly, women and residents of minority neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>The rules cover the advertising, brokering and issuing of high-cost home loans. The state said they would help ensure that borrowers understood the terms of their loans and could afford to repay them. The rules would curb repeated refinancing that did not help borrowers and the ''packing'' of loans with excessive points, fees and other charges.</p>
        <p>But critics said the rules were a major disappointment, especially since New York is the nation's biggest banking center and has had more predatory loans than any other state. New York's rules fall far short of the North Carolina law, the critics said, and the final version is weaker than the initial draft issued several months ago.</p>
        <p>The new rules ''would largely let predatory lenders off the hook,'' said Sarah Ludwig, director of the nonprofit Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project and an organizer of New Yorkers for Responsible Lending. ''The proposed regulation,'' she said, ''invites shady lenders and brokers to find ways to get around the law.''</p>
        <p>Among the many criticisms were the failure to ban prepayment penalties, which tend to lock victims into onerous loans, and a loophole that would permit lenders to ignore ''the borrower's apparent lack of capacity to repay the loan.''</p>
