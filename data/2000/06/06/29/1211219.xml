        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani attacked Consolidated Edison yesterday for Monday's power breakdowns, accusing the utility of shoddy management and saying he had decided to reinstate an investigatory panel to review the utility's service to consumers.</p>
        <p>The city's top lawyer followed suit, saying the city was withdrawing a settlement offer it had made to the utility in a lawsuit over last year's blackout in Washington Heights.</p>
        <p>Although Monday's power failure was smaller, confined to eight buildings on the Upper East Side, and briefer than others in recent years that crippled large sections of the city, several city officials said yesterday that they were angered by Con Ed's decision to reduce power so early in the summer.</p>
        <p>''The troubling question is, if they can't handle an 88-degree day in June, what happens when it gets to 98 in August?'' said Michael D. Hess, the corporation counsel.</p>
        <p>Both the mayor and Mr. Hess expressed dissatisfaction with the company's explanation that it decided on the reductions because power consumption had nearly reached its capacity, especially since the city had received assurances that it would spend $315 million to upgrade its systems to prevent a recurrence of last year's blackout. That 19-hour power failure prompted the city to sue Con Ed, with the Giuliani administration seeking compensation for police and emergency service expenses and threatening to ask the Public Service Commission to take action against the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hess said yesterday that the lawsuit  had been ''close to settlement until this hiccup on Monday.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Con Edison, Joseph Petta, responded to the mayor's complaints yesterday, saying that ''no electrical power company in the world can guarantee no outages.'' But he said a $100 million upgrade of cables and other equipment in New York City since last year's blackout in upper Manhattan ''has gone a long way to further improving the most reliable energy distribution system in the country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Petta said that electrical consumption by New York City businesses and residents on Monday was at its third-highest level of any day in history, and that electric supplies were growing tighter because ''the economy is booming and fuel prices are higher.'' He said Con Ed thought that ''more plants are needed to meet the growing demand.''</p>
        <p>Con Edison officials have pointed out that just eight buildings and about 76,000 customers were affected for just a few hours on Monday.</p>
        <p>At his daily press briefing, Mayor Giuliani rejected assertions by Con Ed executives that heavy use of air-conditioners, combined with the increased demands of computers and other electrical appliances, had pushed the generating capacity of the company's suppliers close to the limit.</p>
        <p>''It's no excuse to say people use too much power,'' the mayor said. He then announced that he would reappoint a City Hall task force, including Mr. Hess and John Dyson, one of the mayor's closest advisers and a former deputy mayor, to examine the utility's performance in delivering electricity to New Yorkers. Last year, the panel was established to investigate Con Ed's management and distribution system, and to demand changes.</p>
        <p>''Con Edison should be prepared for people using too much power,'' the mayor said, adding the the task force would ''make recommendations on the demands we now should make'' on the utility. Among them, he said, is likely to be a revised system of handling power disruptions like the one on Monday, in which ''a lot of people at Con Ed didn't appear to know what they were doing.''</p>
        <p>In lashing out at the company yesterday, Mr. Giuliani joined other top city officials in viewing with some skepticism Con Ed's suggestion that it faces a severe long-term problem in generating capacity, instead of the more immediate snags caused by failures in its power lines and distribution system. Con Ed, under the mandates of federal deregulation of the electrical utility industry, sold all three of its oil-powered electrical plants in New York City last year.</p>
        <p>Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, who was consulted by Mr. Giuliani yesterday, said Con Ed's assertions that its generating capacity was being pushed to the limit ''may be a ploy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone said Con Ed, working in consort with the utilities that have bought its New York City plants, might be using power disruptions to put pressure on regulators to approve construction of a new electrical power plant in the city.</p>
        <p>Mr. Petta replied that Con Ed ''can't comment, since we no longer own those plants.'' The three former Con Ed plants have been bought by KeySpan, Orion Power Holdings and the NRG unit of Northern States Power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said he had instructed Mr. Hess, Mr. Dyson and others he appointed to his mayoral task force to investigate Con Ed's management policies, and the broader assertions that it had reached the limit of its generating capacity.</p>
        <p>''There is a management issue,'' he said, adding that Con Ed's senior management appeared on Monday not to immediately recognize the severity of the problem on the Upper East Side. He described management questions as ''the most important in the short term.''</p>
