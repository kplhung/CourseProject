        <p>The newest crop of television stars are devoid of ego, blind ambition and agents who request astronomical salaries. They don't undermine their co-stars, and their so-called friends don't go blabbing to the tabloids.</p>
        <p>No, a new age of decorum has not dawned in the television world. The new stars are animals: dogs, cats, crocodiles, snakes, turtles and even giant squid.</p>
        <p>Some of the animals play other animals (a dog named Howard is the new Lassie). Others are on trial (like those on ''Judge Wapner's Animal Court''). Others undergo surgery (on ''Emergency Vets''). Many are just being themselves while being stalked by indefatigable humans (''Crocodile Hunter'' and ''Jack Hanna's Animal Adventures'').</p>
        <p>After years of relative scarcity, shows about animals are multiplying: some two dozen can now be found on television. And they are being watched by ever larger audiences.</p>
        <p>''When I started eight years ago, there were three or four animal shows on television,'' Mr. Hanna said. ''Now -- golly day! It's hard to believe.''</p>
        <p>In recent months, two shows about extinct creatures on the Discovery Channel have drawn the largest audiences ever for cable programs other than sports or news. ''Walking with Dinosaurs,'' which used computer graphics to create the world of the dinosaurs, was watched by 10.7 million people. ''Raising the Mammoth,'' a documentary tracking an expedition that unearthed a wooly mammoth, was watched by 10.1 million people.</p>
        <p>Animal Planet, a cable network that features programs about animals 24 hours a day, is the fastest-growing channel on cable television, now reaching 60 million households, or 60 percent of those with televisions. On a good night, its audience size is equal to or greater than Larry King's on CNN. This fall National Geographiccoei will start up its own cable channel, with a large percentage of its programming focusing on the animal kingdom.</p>
        <p>On a typical day, the majority of cable subscribers are offered 32 hours of animals. The Learning Channel, the Pax network and even CNBC, the financial network, offer wildlife programs, as PBS has for decades.</p>
        <p>But the genre has changed. In the 1960's and 70's  nature programming typically offered the heavy monotone of a narrator with instructional shots from Africa, India or other faraway places, as in ''Wild Kingdom'' and ''The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau.''</p>
        <p>Later came programs centering on fights to the death -- in the trade,  ''fang television'' -- and offerings like the Fox network's ''When Good Pets Go Bad,'' which served up videos of snarling pets turning on their masters.</p>
        <p>The new programs are livelier than the early vintage and less violent than the fang-heavy ones. They feature colorful hosts and include more close-up photography.  They seek to educate and entertain at the same time. And they are heavily promoted.</p>
        <p>''The quality of the material has progressively gotten better,'' said Larry Gerbrandt, a media analyst with Paul Kagan Associates, which  follows programming trends. ''The footage has gotten more exciting and networks like Discovery and Animal Planet have really figured out how to generate ratings.''</p>
        <p>Television programmers, media analysts like Mr. Gerbrandt and academic experts attribute the resurgence to the expanding array of cable channels; the relatively low costs of making wildlife documentaries, which are now shot with vastly improved cameras; and the growing adoration e for nonhumans of every stripe.</p>
        <p>The animal genre ''couldn't compete in a network world,'' said Jeff Sagansky, president of the Pax network, which recently added reruns of Mr. Hanna's ''Animal Adventures'' to its daily schedule. ''But it can compete in more of a niche world,''  he said of the new universe of cable, digital cable, satellite TV and smaller broadcast networks like Pax.</p>
        <p>The smaller networks crave original programming that they can call their own, but they do not have a lot of money for the writers, producers, crews and actors. The wildlife shows require only a small staff.</p>
        <p>''So far, these animals have not been signed by Aftra, so you don't pay residuals,'' Mr. Sagansky joked, in a reference to the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.</p>
        <p>The programs are also attractive to parents troubled by increasingly racy network shows.</p>
        <p>''It's a safe harbor on the dial,'' said Clark Bunting, president of Animal Planet. ''People are looking for the opportunity to do something as a family and not have the kids on the computer, dad watching sports and  mom watching something else.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bunting said that the programs were also simply good television, produced with the goal of entertainment. ''A typical show used to be about lions in the Serengeti, and the story was about the alpha male and the beta female and all that sort of thing,'' Mr. Bunting said. ''Now, people have used elements of story to hook the viewers and bring them in.''</p>
        <p>Animal Planet's No. 1 lure is Steve Irwin, host of ''The Crocodile Hunter,'' the network's top-rated program, which is regularly shown on Sunday and Wednesday nights and is watched in an average of 400,000 households. Its popularity led Animal Planet executives to run the show every night from June 18-24 in what was heavily promoted as ''Croc Week.''</p>
        <p>The first two nights' programs brought Planet's highest prime-time ratings ever. The June 18 edition of ''Crocodile Hunter'' was watched by more than one million viewers, the largest audience in the channel's four-year history.</p>
        <p>Mr. Irwin, known for his thick Australian accent and khaki outfits, seems to regularly court death in the program as he roves the swamps of Florida, the Australian outback and Sumatra in search of crocodiles and any other large and dangerous animal he can come upon.</p>
        <p>In one recent episode, he jumped into a river and wrestled a ''crocker'' into submission with his bare hands. In another, while visiting the  Komodo dragons of Komodo Island, Mr. Irwin wound up being chased by one that bit into the back of his boot as he scurried up a tree. He caught his breath and excitedly told the camera, ''This is a great demonstration of how dangerous they are!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Irwin has been the subject of a ''Saturday Night Live'' skit, is negotiating a movie deal and will soon have his own action figure.</p>
        <p>Helping the nature genre as a whole is a new generation of small video cameras that capture shots that would have been impossible even a couple of years ago.</p>
        <p>''Now,'' Mr. Bunting said, ''you can fly in formation with Canada  geese, and your sense of perspective, as a viewer is you think that you're a goose.''</p>
        <p>The network's other defining show, ''Emergency Vets,'' focuses on the animals rushed to the Alameda East Veterinary Hospital in Colorado. A typical scene: Zorro, a potbellied pig who rides a skateboard in a traveling animal show, eats some plastic, which causes an infection in an upper molar on the left side of his mouth. The infection spreads to his sinus system and causes his head to swell. The vets extract the tooth and give him antibiotics, and Zorro is free to perform again.</p>
        <p>Akira Matsuka Lippit, a professor of cinema at San Francisco State University, suggests that the current animal craze has a broader explanation than intense interest in snakes and potbellied pigs. He links it to a sweep of technological advances that are distancing people from simpler ways of life.</p>
        <p>''There is a rapid increase in a kind of technologization of the culture and there is perhaps a desperate attempt to reconnect the human body and existence to a certain kind of animal, and natural, state,'' said Mr. Lippit, author of the recent book ''Electric Animal: Toward a Rhetoric of Wildlife'' (University of Minnesota Press).</p>
        <p>Bernard Rollin, a professor of philosophy and physiology at the University of Colorado who has written extensively on the relationship between animals and society, said the programs' popularity might also be related to urbanization.</p>
        <p>''People are fascinated by animals because we're removed from animals,'' Mr. Rollin said. Such programs give humans a glimpse of natural phenomena that their very distant ancestors lived with every day, he added.</p>
        <p>Within the television industry, there is nonetheless a concern that animal programming is reaching a saturation point. ''I'm sure some of them are going to be weeded out,''  said Mr. Hanna.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, he said, it will come down to the survival of the fittest.</p>
