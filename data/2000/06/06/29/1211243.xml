        <p>The purpose of the roof that went up over the bench in the visitors' bullpen at Shea Stadium last night was not to protect the Florida Marlins. That is a Rocker Roof, and when the Mets play host to the Atlanta Braves tonight, it will shield the notorious John Rocker from harm.</p>
        <p>The Mets had one more meeting with the Marlins before their four-game showdown with the Braves, who hold a two-game lead over the Mets in the National League East. The first reliever to emerge from the left-field fortress last night was Ricky Bones; the Mets should not expect Atlanta's relievers to be so generous.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the roof that went up over the bench in the visitors' bullpen at Shea Stadium last night was not to protect the Florida Marlins. That is a Rocker Roof, and when the Mets play host to the Atlanta Braves tonight, it will shield the notorious John Rocker from harm.</p>
        <p>The Mets had one more meeting with the Marlins before their four-game showdown with the Braves, who hold a two-game lead over the Mets in the National League East. The first reliever to emerge from the left-field fortress last night was Ricky Bones; the Mets should not expect Atlanta's relievers to be so generous.</p>
        <p>Called in with the bases loaded and a two-run lead in the sixth inning, Bones could not stop a sudden outbreak of wildness and sloppy play that helped the Mets earn their seventh victory in a row, 6-5.</p>
        <p>With Armando Benitez unavailable because he had pitched three of the last four games, John Franco preserved the Mets' victory with his third save.</p>
        <p>Franco, who struck out Preston Wilson with a changeup in a crucial spot on Tuesday, ended the game by getting Wilson to ground out, again on a changeup.</p>
        <p>Of course, another left-handed reliever, Rocker, will command most of the attention tonight, when a news media contingent comparable to one for a playoff game descends on Shea.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's going to make or break us, but it's a big series,'' Franco said. ''We're playing well and they're playing O.K. The main thing is hopefully everyone realizes there's a baseball game going on, and they're not coming to see the circus.''</p>
        <p>A crowd of 37,252 watched another tight game last night, when the Mets scored five runs in the sixth inning to come from behind and win. Florida's starter, Brad Penny, had walked three of his last four hitters, the last forcing in a run, when Bones was summoned.</p>
        <p>But Bones walked Derek Bell to bring in a run, and then got Mike Piazza to ground toward the hole between short and third. Shortstop Andy Fox could not field it, and the Mets tied the score at 4-4 on the error. Mark Johnson came up, and he lashed a two-run single to left that gave the Mets a 6-4 lead.</p>
        <p>Johnson, whose two-run homer was a crucial blow in Monday's victory over the Marlins, was making his first start since being recalled from Class AAA Norfolk. He was a late addition to the lineup, starting because of lingering soreness in the right shoulder of third baseman Robin Ventura.</p>
        <p>Ventura, who injured the shoulder diving for a ball on Sunday, acknowledged the soreness before the game but said it was unrelated to his off-season shoulder surgery.</p>
        <p>Ventura walked as a pinch-hitter in the sixth inning and was replaced by a pinch-runner, pitcher Mike Hampton. He said he would play tonight.</p>
        <p>''It was just one of those things,'' Ventura said. ''It's June. Why take a chance? Just wait another day.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' sixth-inning outburst gave the victory to Bobby J. Jones, who fell behind by 4-1 but worked six innings to even his record at 3-3.</p>
        <p>After the Mets took their 6-4 lead, Dennis Cook allowed two hits to give one run back. Cook, who has struggled lately, tossed a towel, shook his head and muttered to himself on the bench. But Pat Mahomes escaped the seventh-inning jam, then worked a 1-2-3 eighth.</p>
        <p>The Mets have identified setup relief as one of their main targets as they approach the trading deadline, partly because they have been unable to rely on Mahomes -- who is also a long reliever and spot starter -- to fill that role.</p>
        <p>But if Mahomes emerges as a dependable pitcher in the later innings, General Manager Steve Phillips said, it could change whom he pursues in a trade.</p>
        <p>The Mets could also rest Turk Wendell more often if they could use Mahomes late in games.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>If the Yankees' talks with the Cubs about SAMMY SOSA fall through, the Cubs apparently will not have much luck if they turn to New York's other team.</p>
        <p>There are no active talks between the Mets and the Cubs regarding Sosa, and the Mets seem to think that acquiring Sosa would deplete them for the future. Without acknowledging Sosa, General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS said, ''There were big acquisitions that we considered that we are no longer considering.''</p>
        <p>The Mets covet Seattle shortstop ALEX RODRIGUEZ, who will be a free agent this winter and would not cost them any prospects.</p>
        <p>If the Mets get Rodriguez, they would have significant offensive players at catcher and all four infield positions, which would make it easier to go with a young outfield made up partly of the prospects other teams want in trades.</p>
        <p>The Mets are also aware of Rodriguez's often-stated promise to consider the depth of a club's farm system in deciding where he signs, which could give the Mets even more reason to hold on to their top prospects.</p>
        <p>As for this season's shortstop, it seems more and more likely that the Mets will stay with MELVIN MORA to replace the injured REY ORDONEZ. A baseball official said the Mets' talks with San Francisco about RICH AURILIA appear to be over, and Baltimore has sent mixed signals as to the availability of MIKE BORDICK.</p>
        <p>MIKE PIAZZA's run-scoring groundout in the third inning last night gave him runs batted in in 11 consecutive games, breaking the club record he set last year. Piazza later faced a shift in which the Marlins' second baseman played directly behind second base. Piazza grounded a single through the vacated hole. . . . EDGARDO ALFONZO and TODD ZEILE were given routine days off and were not in the starting lineup.</p>
        <p>Pitching matchups for the Braves series are GREG MADDUX vs. RICK REED tonight, KEVIN MILLWOOD vs. MIKE HAMPTON tomorrow, JOHN BURKETT vs. AL LEITER on Saturday and TOM GLAVINE vs. GLENDON RUSCH on Sunday. The Sunday game will begin at 1:10 p.m., as originally scheduled. ESPN chose a different game for its 8 p.m. telecast.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow night's game is sold out. As of 8 o'clock last night, the Mets had sold 41,500 tickets for tonight, 39,000 for Saturday and 36,500 for Sunday.</p>
