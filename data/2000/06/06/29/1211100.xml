        <p>THREE a.m. on a summer Friday here. A smoke-filled room is packed with men, faces lighted by computer monitors, adrenaline running from online combat. Bicycles clutter the alley outside the door under the sign that reads NG Cafe.</p>
        <p>The men are muttering into their headsets, discussing attack strategies with teammates seated only a few computers away. Brown and green scenes of soldiers, terrain and tanks scroll rapidly across the screens. A mobile phone rings. ''What?'' a man snaps at the caller who interrupted him. ''I'm playing computer games.''</p>
        <p>NG Cafe is a Net cafe, or a wangba, the businesses that serve as late-night entertainment sites for hundreds of Beijing residents. The putative reason the wangbas operate is to provide online access. But the global scope of the Internet seemed to be mostly an afterthought in a room where 18 of the 20 computers were engaged in electronic warfare with opponents sitting nearby. To many Chinese men, the emergence of the networked computer has less to do with e-commerce than it has with e-battle.</p>
        <p>Six juniors from nearby Peking University have come for an all-night session of Starcraft, a popular multiplayer computer game. One of the students, Simon Zhang, said that his economics professor had joked that Americans routed the Iraqis in the Gulf War because they had more experience playing video games. ''There's some logic to his joke,'' Mr. Zhang said.</p>
        <p>Everyone in the room is male, a demographic reflected in the fact that the bathroom has only a urinal. Everyone else is directed to a brick hut across the alley. Most of the men, mainly students and professionals who work nearby, arrived around midnight, and many will not leave until dawn.</p>
        <p>One man has fallen asleep, his head collapsed against the table. Another is asleep, sprawled across three chairs. An orange sign on the wall reads: ''Loud Yelling is Prohibited''; it was prompted by the frequent over-exuberance of players in the throes of victory or defeat. Smoke burns their eyes, and some computer keys are charred from errantly placed cigarettes.</p>
        <p>The fact that the government considers the playing of computer games in wangbas illegal has not stopped thousands of them, and their cousins, the game parlors (which typically do not provide Internet access, just locally networked computers) from springing up across China. The term cafe seems excessively elegant for the one-room hovels heated by coal stoves that are NG Cafe's lower-end counterparts and where customers generally pay about 50 cents an hour and play for hours on end.</p>
        <p>But the proliferation of wangbas and game parlors in the last three years has vexed a government that aspires to monitor social, political and economic trends. Wangbas, the government believes, have the potential to alter all three.</p>
        <p>When the Internet came to China about five years ago, observers around the world thought that it would help reshape the politics and economics of the country by introducing residents to ideas and ways of life that the government had tried to restrict.</p>
        <p>When NG Cafe opened, its owners predicted that most of the business would come from people seeking Internet access.</p>
        <p>But Wang Peng, who works nights at the cafe, said that in the seven months since the NG Cafe opened, game playing had grown to about 70 percent of business. Visits to wangbas and game parlors from Kashgar to Kunming to Kaifeng revealed similar ratios: people are less likely to be chatting online than battling online. Some wangbas, particularly those near universities, have customers who mostly use the computers for e-mail messaging, chatting or surfing the Web. But the further the cafes are from educated affluent areas, the more computer games take center stage.</p>
        <p>Computer games are to Chinese men what pickup basketball games are to American men. Instead of going to the neighborhood court, Chinese men head to their neighborhood wangba. Here, those who are most savvy on the battlefield earn the respect of their peers and engage in the digital equivalent of trash talk.</p>
        <p>''It's a social activity,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''Playing a game on the Net is very different from playing a game on a machine because you can feel other people's hearts beating during the game.''</p>
        <p>He typed in a message to his teammates in Chinglish, a Chinese-English hybrid: ''go zhou. wo dian ta.'' (Go attack Zhou, I've electrified him.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Zhang's roommate, Otto Hua, 21, said there were some weeks when he played multiplayer games for more than 20 hours.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the government prohibited the playing of computer games in wangbas, a restriction that has been sporadically enforced. (Wangbas were still permitted to provide Internet access, just not for gameplaying.)</p>
        <p>In 1999, the government repeated the restriction as part of a collection of regulations that also prohibited wangba customers from engaging in activities endangering national security and disrupting public security and order.</p>
        <p>Editorials published in The People's Daily depict wangbas, game parlors and computer games as a ''plague'' and a ''poison.''  Newspapers and television broadcasts regularly report on students addicted to computer games who do not return home for days, steal money from their parents and give themselves to the wangbas in indentured servitude to pay their bills.</p>
        <p>Wangba owners must now go to their local public security bureau to register within 30 days of receiving a business license. In the last several months, government enforcement has become stricter. Several hundred unregistered wangbas and game parlors in Beijing were closed in March, and several hundred wangbas and game parlors in Shanghai were raided last year.</p>
        <p>Some wangbas have responded to the clampdown. Feiyu, a wangba chain south of Peking University, has restricted game playing. But other wangba owners are resisting limits on their lucrative businesses. Last year, a wangba owner in the province of Zhejiang challenged the restrictions in court saying that despite its social harm, computer gaming has the potential of aiding development of information technology in China. In February, the courts rejected the claim, citing wangbas' societal harm.</p>
        <p>By 4:30 a.m., the sky over NG Cafe is light. Mr. Zhang and his classmates leave at 5:30 a.m. after five hours. By 8 a.m., most of the older customers have left and another wave of players, mostly younger, arrives, ignoring the sign that prohibits elementary and middle school students from entering.</p>
        <p>''We're not afraid of the regulations,'' said Zhang Shi Miao, 13, a student at a middle school. ''The government is overreacting. Most people don't become addicted to computer games. It's just for fun.''</p>
        <p>Many customers are unaware that playing computer games in wangbas is forbidden.</p>
        <p>''We don't know about these rules. Therefore the responsibility is not on us,'' said Mr. Zhang when told of the regulations. ''If they don't strictly administer the law, then we can still go on playing.''</p>
        <p>He said it was unlikely that the government would suddenly strictly enforce the prohibitions.</p>
        <p>''There are too many interests in computer-game playing for that to happen,'' he  said. ''In America you would call it lobbying. In China we call it bribery.''</p>
