        <p>If the Sammy Sosa deal is going to be finished, somebody is going to have to give it a good shove. Maybe that will be George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, who is eager to make a big deal. Maybe it will be the Cubs, faced with the possibility that the Yankees' current offer might be the best they can get.</p>
        <p>Cubs executives are waiting for the Yankees to cave in to their demands. Yankee executives are weighing the huge cost, in prospects and dollars, of acquiring Sosa, and are exploring other modest improvements, such as trading for Oakland's John Jaha or San Diego's Ed Sprague. The stalemate continues.</p>
        <p>According to a person with knowledge of the trade talks, this is the Yankees' current four-player offer: the Cubs will receive the Class AA outfielder Jackson Melian, the Class AAA pitcher Jake Westbrook, outfielder Ricky Ledee and a choice of two minor league infielders -- either Alfonso Soriano, who is one of the Yankees' top prospects, or D'Angelo Jimenez, a touted infielder who has been out all year after breaking a bone in his neck in the off-season.</p>
        <p>The Cubs want more; they want five players. They want Melian, Ledee, Westbrook and both Soriano and Jimenez, or one of those two and pitcher Alex Graman, a 22-year-old left-hander with Class A Tampa.</p>
        <p>''They've been pretty much there all week, and they are at an impasse,'' said a person with knowledge of the talks. ''But sides appear to be pretty well entrenched. Nothing has changed these last couple of days. There has been no progress. It doesn't look like there's going to be any change.''</p>
        <p>Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, is said by others to be very reluctant to surrender such a significant package of prospects, knowing that the cost will be double edged. The Yankees will have to give Sosa a four- or five-year extension for something in the range of $17 million to $20 million a year, and in addition, the Yankees would suffer for all the low-priced talent they would give away. Soriano, Melian, Westbrook and the others could serve the Yankees for the next half-decade for bargain basement salaries, and the Yankees might have to acquire older, more expensive players instead.</p>
        <p>So the Yankees are looking at other ways to improve and keep their prospects. They know they need pitching, like Francisco Cordova or Jose Silva of the Pirates, or the Rangers' Esteban Loaiza, with Ramiro Mendoza and Roger Clemens currently on the disabled list and little talent ready for the major leagues at Class AAA Columbus.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have had fruitless talks with the Baltimore Orioles about B. J. Surhoff so far. The Orioles have asked for Ledee and Melian, but the Yankees have had more promising discussions with the Athletics about the 34-year-old Jaha and with the Padres about Sprague, 32.</p>
        <p>Jaha hit 35 homers for Oakland last year, but he has been battling injuries this season and only recently has returned to the lineup, batting .178 with 1 homer in 26 games before last night. Jaha is adept at working the count and drawing walks. Even with his low batting average, he has accumulated a .429 on-base percentage, and is averaging 4.72 pitches per plate appearance, at a time when 3.7 pitches per plate appearance is considered average.</p>
        <p>Oakland, which is loaded with first base/designated hitter types like Jaha, has talked with the Boston Red Sox about the slugger as well. The Yankees could probably get Jaha for a good, but not great, prospect or a serviceable relief pitcher.</p>
        <p>Sprague was hitting .274 with 10 homers in 117 at-bats before last night's game for the Padres, who have been devastated by injuries and are looking to trade the veterans for young players. He hit 22 homers last year, and has 8 homers in 74 at-bats this year against left-handed pitchers.</p>
        <p>The Yankees could use Jaha or Sprague against lefties, mix one of them in at first base and D.H., the way they wanted to do with Jim Leyritz before it became clear that Leyritz's diminished bat speed rendered him ineffective early in the season. The Yankees would like to acquire Jaha or Sprague, regardless of whether they make the Sosa deal.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' losses keep mounting, however: 26 defeats in the last 41 games, a 37-35 record over all. ''The only thing that's helping us,'' David Cone said after Tuesday's 7-6 defeat, ''is that there is consistent mediocrity in the division. That's what is keeping us in the race.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner, executives say, is angrily pressuring Cashman to make a big deal. The Cubs, on the other hand, do not appear to have much of a market for Sosa, with few teams willing to dump a truckload of prospects and then have enough money to negotiate a new deal with Sosa, who can veto any trade possibility.</p>
        <p>If there is a nudge from either side, the deal can be finished, Sosa would be in pinstripes and Ledee would face the unhappy fans in Wrigley Field. But that nudge is required.</p>
