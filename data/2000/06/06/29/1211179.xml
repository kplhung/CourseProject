        <p>An Iraqi man brandishing two machine guns and explosives shot his way into a United Nations office today in Baghdad, Iraq, killing two officials, wounding seven and taking some 50 hostages. After a siege of nearly three hours, he gave himself up and said he had taken the hostages to demand an end to United Nations sanctions against his country.</p>
        <p>Iraqi officials, who later made the man available to reporters and television cameras, identified him as Fuad Hussein Haider, 38, a car mechanic.</p>
        <p>But the demands he made and the fact that Iraqi citizens do not normally have access to automatic weapons in a country that is very tightly policed raised questions among diplomats and some officials here about possible complicity of the Iraqi government or one of its many security services.</p>
        <p>''The reason is the embargo, the death and murder of thousands of Iraqi children and elderly,'' Mr. Haider told reporters after the event in an unusual news conference in Baghdad. ''I wanted to relay a message, to explain the tragedy.''</p>
        <p>United Nations officials said that Mr. Haider had demanded the resumption of now banned civilian flights between Baghdad and Amman, Jordan; an increase in food rations distributed under the ''oil-for-food'' program; an end to American and British sorties over no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq, and compensation for Iraqis who have suffered because of them; and the installation outside United Nations headquarters of a statue in memory of Iraqi children who died because of the embargo.</p>
        <p>Benon Sevan, who directs the Iraqi oil-sales program from New York and is also in charge of United Nations staff security, told reporters that the gunman first tried to enter the oil-sales program's offices at the edge of Baghdad in a heavily fortified former hotel school shared with United Nations arms inspectors.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Haider could not get into that building, he went to the offices of the Food and Agricultural Organization in a wealthy residential neighborhood near Baghdad University.</p>
        <p>The Iraqi police and officials of the Food and Agricultural Organization said Mr. Haider began to fire in the office reception area on the ground floor, then went upstairs and continued shooting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haider told a different story to reporters in Baghdad. He said that he did not shoot first, but was fired at by Iraqi guards in the building.  ''When the guards opened fire on me, I started shooting indiscriminately,'' Mr. Haider said. ''I wanted to take foreigners working in this organization as hostages.''</p>
        <p>He said he was prepared to die, as many other Iraqis had died since sanctions were imposed in 1990 after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, and that he had been persuaded to surrender by an Iraqi official.</p>
        <p>The United Nations identified the dead as Yusuf Abdilleh, a Somali administrative officer, and Marewan Mohammed Hassan, an Iraqi hired to maintain a computer data base.</p>
        <p>The Food and Agricultural Organization, based in Rome, works with the oil-sales program both in areas controlled by the Iraqi government and in autonomous Kurdish regions, where the United Nations takes direct charge of relief projects.</p>
        <p>Among the seven injured in the building were a Nepali consultant and four government-supplied guards. Mr. Sevan said that 50 hostages were being held at one point. There was no explanation for why it took the government more than two hours to send police reinforcements  to free them.</p>
