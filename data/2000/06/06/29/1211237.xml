        <p>True North Communications in Chicago said yesterday that it would reorganize the top management of its media operations as Mike Drexler, executive vice president and worldwide media director at FCB Worldwide in New York, leaves.</p>
        <p>''The time has come for me to turn the mantle over to a team of executives who I know will take True North's media operations to the next step,'' said Mr. Drexler, 61, adding that he planned ''to focus more on the new-media world.''</p>
        <p>Scot Butler, 49, executive vice president and media director at the Chicago office of FCB, succeeds Mr. Drexler as worldwide media director and also takes a new post, president at TN Media, the True North media services agency.</p>
        <p>Two executives of FCB sibling shops are being given the added duties of executive vice presidents at TN: Michael Bracken, 52, executive vice president and media director at Temerlin McClain in Irving, Tex., and Lillian Kennedy, 44, managing partner and media director at the Bozell Group in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drexler began his advertising career in 1960 as a media assistant at Ogilvy &amp; Mather in New York, now part of the WPP Group. He joined Bozell in 1986 and held posts there that included worldwide media director. After Bozell was acquired by True North in late 1997, he became chairman at TN. He was named to his FCB post in January.</p>
