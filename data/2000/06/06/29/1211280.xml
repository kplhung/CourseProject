        <p>The Knicks went into last night's draft with an eye for a trade. Over the last three days, General Manager Scott Layden was increasingly interested in Dallas guard Erick Strickland.</p>
        <p>When the Knicks' turn came at No. 22, they chose Donnell Harvey, a 19-year-old, 6-foot-8-inch power forward who played for the University of Florida for one year, and two hours later they announced the trade that sent Harvey and John Wallace to Dallas for the 6-3 Strickland and the last pick in the draft, the Cincinnati small forward Pete Mickeal.</p>
        <p>''We set up our priority list and we went down the list of players and at a certain point we made the trade,'' Layden said. ''We chose Harvey for Dallas.</p>
        <p>The Knicks had been interested in either the 7-0 Jason Collier or Jamaal Magloire, but both were taken. With both centers off the board, the decision apparently was easier for Layden.</p>
        <p>Strickland, 26, started 67 of 68 games for the Mavericks, averaging 12.8 points a game, shooting 43 percent from the floor, and averaging 4.8 rebounds a game.</p>
        <p>''In order to get Erick Strickland at this time, we feel very good about this trade,'' Layden said. ''We're excited to have him here. He plays hard, with a lot of energy. He's going to help us get better. We feel good about our roster.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks seem to have a logjam in the backcourt -- Charlie Ward, Chris Childs, Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston -- but would not comment whether the Knicks intended to package one of the guards to improve their frontcourt that features questions surrounding the aging, injured and inconsistent Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson and Marcus Camby.</p>
        <p>Throughout the playoffs, Coach Jeff Van Gundy's refrain was a cry for rebounding. In 16 games, opponents had a total of 67 more rebounds than the Knicks.</p>
        <p>It was not their first acquisition at guard. With the 39th pick of the draft, and the second round, the Knicks chose the St. John's shooting guard, Lavor Postell.</p>
        <p>Layden said that he had been keeping an eye on Strickland throughout the season, but thought more seriously about trading for him in the last three days. ''He's primarly a defensive-rebounding type of guard,'' Van Gundy said. ''He's really just a guard. We were very fortuntate that Latrell and Allan played all 82 games this year. I thought that we could upgrade. Erick will help push those two guys.''</p>
        <p>Both Layden and Van Gundy spoke about Strickland, Postell and Mickeal, a perimeter player from Cincinnati, and constantly praised their energy and work ethics, perhaps hinting that was a missing ingredient in the team that lost in the Eastern Conference finals to the Pacers.</p>
        <p>''I think if somehow you can look at all three picks, those three guys play hard and with energy and they are tough guys,'' Layden said.</p>
        <p>Layden added: ''We were very happy to see him at 39. He has had very good camps, so we're happy that he's with us. Of course, we got a chance to see him play a lot. Once again, he brings some energy to our team that we're excited to see.''</p>
        <p>Postell, at 6-6, averaged 14.3 points a game in his senior year. He was a second team All-Big East selection this past year and led St. John's in rebounding, with 6.9 rebounds a game. But he dominated at the Chicago predraft camp where his stock first rose.</p>
        <p>''To be honest, I was just excited for my name to be called,'' Postell said, with 40 friends and family crowded in his house in Albany, Ga., yelling in the background. ''I'm just happy to be going to the Knicks. It's a good situation for me. It's going to be good for me to be back in New York, after being at St. John's.''</p>
        <p>Postell views his coming to the Knicks as his chance to step out of the shadows, where he lurked at St. John's for four years. ''Of course I do,'' he said. ''I just want to go in and give some quality minutes. I'd like to hopefully play 20 to 24 minutes a game.''</p>
        <p>But who, exactly, might Postell be teaming with in the backcourt? As of last night, the situation was murky. ''Who plays will all work itself out,'' Van Gundy said. ''The best players will play.''</p>
        <p>Strickland, a left-handed point guard who can also play shooting guard was undrafted four years ago and had a short stint in the Continental Basketball Association, but has had success especially in the last year.</p>
        <p>Wallace was a free-agent acquisition last August, but he did not pan out, averaging 6.5 points in just 60 games. He played only four minutes in the playoffs, pulling down one rebound, scoring no points and picking up a personal foul.</p>
