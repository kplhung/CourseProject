        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In the ''Real Books on Real Shelves'' section of the June 22 letters, writers aptly noted the various advantages that research at a library offers versus searching the Internet at home or in a dormitory (''The Library as the Latest Web Venture,'' June 15). But one vital advantage of the library that's often overlooked is its environment. A library is planned and designed for quiet study, and it provides an atmosphere conducive to thinking and peaceful reflection. But while doing research on the Net at home, one has to put up with a myriad of distractions: the telephone, the kids, pets, the television, the refrigerator and so on. (And that's not even getting into the distractions of working in a dorm room!)</p>
