        <p>ONE morning in early June, Dr. Peter Del Tredici led the way around the Arnold Arboretum at Harvard University to some of the beautiful old plants he says are tough enough to ride the roller coaster of recent climate changes.

        <p>ONE morning in early June, Dr. Peter Del Tredici led the way around the Arnold Arboretum at Harvard University to some of the beautiful old plants he says are tough enough to ride the roller coaster of recent climate changes. Among them was the Chinese fringe tree (Chionanthus retusas), with its masses of little white blossoms covering its broad branches like a silken shawl.  The fragrance was so intoxicating I wanted to open my arms and walk right into it.</p>
        <p>Dr. Del Tredici, the arboretum's director of living collections, grinned at the obvious effect of this forgotten tree, brought there by the Scottish plantsman Robert Fortune in the 1800's.</p>
        <p>''That tree's been here 100 years,'' Dr. Del Tredici said. ''It doesn't need watering, and it grows as well here as in Southern California.'' In the next five years, he predicted, it will be as popular as Cornus kousa, the Japanese dogwood, the common replacement for the Florida dogwood, which is disappearing from Eastern woodlands because of the stresses of soil and air pollution, invasive species and anthracnose.</p>
        <p>The arboretum, founded in 1872 and designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, rambles for 265 acres over the hills of Jamaica Plain, Mass. As plant explorers continue to add to the collection of 7,000 woody plants, it stands as a vast repository of the temperate world's hardiest specimens. It's Dr. Del Tredici's living laboratory, where he observes, almost daily, which plants survive the ups and downs of contemporary weather.</p>
        <p>''February was like April, March was like December,'' Dr. Del Tredici said. There are droughts in regions that once got dependable rain, and deluges in regions used to long dry spells.</p>
        <p>The fringe tree bumps shoulders with another wonderful toughy, the Japanese spicebush (Lindera obtusiloba), a shrub about 10 feet tall and just as wide, with grass-green lobed leaves that turn bright yellow in the fall. They were definitely a statement, and I wanted them both.</p>
        <p>I also changed my mind about the flame azalea, Rhododendron calendulaceum, which I've grown to loathe from seeing too many hot-pink gumdrops and salmon bushes pruned within an inch of their lives, baking under full sun on an emerald-green lawn. But here, dozens of them descended a wooded hill in varying shades of yellow, orange, pink and salmon. The dappled shade of tall oaks softened their jarring colors; no electric pruners had ruined their naturally graceful shape.</p>
        <p>''They do equally well in sun or shade, dry or wet,'' Dr. Del Tredici said. ''They've performed here constantly for 100 years, no matter what the climate.'' Inferior hybrids and cultivars, he said, have displaced the original species, which not only is gorgeous, but also resists powdery mildew.</p>
        <p>Another delightful little-known plant is Aristolochia manshuriensis, or Manchurian Dutchman's pipe, which has showy yellow flowers in early spring, before it covers itself with big trident-shaped leaves. It's hardy to Zone 4, or where temperatures can drop to minus 30.</p>
        <p>And if you don't have a fragrant winter hazel, Corylopsis glabrescens produces soft yellow flowers in early spring; treat yourself to one near the house. It likes partial shade and moist soil, however, so don't kid yourself if you live in a desert.</p>
        <p>Dr. Del Tredici, who teaches at Harvard's Graduate School of Design, tries to get his students' heads out of the design clouds. It's a good lesson for homeowners as well.</p>
        <p>''What happens after the landscape design is installed?'' he asked them. ''It's not the end, it's the beginning.'' Think in terms of maintenance: ''Don't put a plant right in the mowing corridor,'' he added. Dr. Del Tredici, for instance, didn't recommend ginkgo trees for Harvard Yard. ''The world view of the maintenance guy is: how much the trees drop and when they drop it.''</p>
        <p>Most of us won't live long enough to see the trees that we plant come into their prime, but that's no reason not to start them for the next generation. And it's a revelation to see the venerable specimens at the Arnold, which has remained true to its plant collecting roots. What a relief to walk for miles along winding paths, drinking in plants that have been planted by the dozens, along banks and hills, and tended for more than a century.</p>
        <p>Some of my personal discoveries that day were the Japanese tree lilac, Syringa reticulata, a 30-footer whose spreading branches were covered with white fragrant blossoms; an old Franklinia alatamaha, with striated dark and light gray bark (its twisting, arching branches will bear creamy white, three-inch flowers in August); and a 30-foot-tall Chinese Stewartia (Stewartia sinensis) whose satiny smooth bark is mottled with rose-orange, tan, gray and green. Another uncommon species, the Chinese Zelkova (Zelkova sinica) grows to 40 feet, and its exfoliating bark exposes bright orange patches. Such trees provide great interest in winter.</p>
        <p>The evergreen sweet bay (Magnolia virginiana var. australis), has narrow leaves with silvery undersides and fragrant flowers in June and July. And if you are looking for a hardy upright holly, with lots of red fruit for winter, try Ilex pedunculosa, the longstalk holly. Dr. Del Tredici recommends it as an informal hedge or a specimen.</p>
        <p>White Enkianthus (Enkianthus perulatus), which eventually grows six feet tall and just as wide, is hardy to Zone 5, or minus 20. It is covered with small white flowers in spring, and its foliage turns fire engine red in the fall.</p>
        <p>The hawthorns are something to see blooming over acres of orchard grass, with mown paths ambling through like ones on an English estate. And there's a drive designed by Olmsted through 80-foot hemlocks and mountain laurel, in full bloom in early June.</p>
        <p>''The hemlocks are all dying of the woolly adelgid, so enjoy it now while you can,'' Dr. Del Tredici said. The Chinese hemlock (Tsuga chinensis), which has been growing at the arboretum since 1910 and is now 60 feet, has not been bothered by the adelgid.</p>
        <p>High on Peters Hill, Dr. Del Tredici has planted his ''savannah,'' clusters of drought-tolerant, flat-topped trees like sumacs, honey locusts, yellowwoods and Kentucky coffee trees. Many are legumes, plants that can fix nitrogen (transform it into food) as well as fertilize the soil. They are also tolerant of heavy clay soil.</p>
        <p>As for conifers, Dr. Del Tredici recommends the California incense cedar, Calocedrus decurrens, which is hardy to Zone 5 and can grow to 60 feet tall even in the East. It's narrow, with bright green foliage, and tolerant to clay and drought.</p>
        <p>And for gardeners plagued by deer, the Japanese plum yew, Cephalotaxus harringtonia Prostrata, is a low-growing evergreen that tolerates clay, likes sun or shade and apparently tastes terrible to voracious deer.</p>
        <p>We'll see how long that lasts. Deer, like these plants, have a great capacity for change.</p>
