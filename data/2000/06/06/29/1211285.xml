        <p>Liberty Coach Richie Adubato didn't need to offer excuses for his team's sputtering season. The Liberty began the defense of its Eastern Conference title without a stable center. A pivotal sixth player, Tamika Whitmore, was overweight and unable to play more than a few minutes without becoming winded. Then Crystal Robinson, the 3-point shooting ace, sprained her ankle.</p>
        <p>But the Liberty made the most of a lackluster effort by the Phoenix Mercury to snap out of its funk last night with an impressive 82-69 victory before 13,054 fans at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>Robinson hit 4 of 6 3-point attempts to finish with 14 points to go with 7 rebounds.</p>
        <p>But the night belonged to the Liberty's Tari Phillips, a 6-foot-1-inch power forward acquired in a trade with Portland. Phillips led all scorers with 22 points.</p>
        <p>Phoenix whittled a 41-23 halftime lead down to 3 points, at 51-48, with 12 minutes 11 seconds remaining. Phillips seemed to take the challenge personally. She scored on a pass from Teresa Weatherspoon, hit an eight-foot jumper and followed that with a layup to give the Liberty a 63-56 lead with 7:21 remaining.</p>
        <p>''Phillips admitted being nervous when the Liberty's lead was reduced to 3. Then I got angry,'' she said. ''I said I don't want to replay that scene because I knew how it felt after the game against Los Angeles, and I knew I didn't want to feel like that again.''</p>
