        <p>WHEN scheduling bumps Max Weinberg's past life into his present, the marathon begins at 2:30 p.m. He scampers on stage at Madison Square Garden, climbs the drum platform and shoots soundcheck drum blasts that ricochet off 20,000 empty seats.</p>
        <p>''I have the best seat in the house,'' Mr. Weinberg comments dreamily, even after all these years. He'll return hours later to play with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, but now he's rushing to his steady gig at Rockefeller Center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weinberg has not played the Garden since 1988, near the end of the glory days, when Mr. Springsteen would introduce his drummer as ''mighty, mighty Max,'' all thunder, no fireworks, imprinting drum surges on hits like ''Born to Run.''</p>
        <p>But when Mr. Springsteen bade the band adieu, Mighty Max reverted to Max Weinberg from South Orange, N.J., becoming just another unemployed drummer with a sore back and seven hand surgeries.</p>
        <p>Such is the success of Mr. Weinberg's dogged, at times hangdog, efforts to keep playing -- weddings here, bar mitzvahs there -- that young fans recognize him not from this reunion tour with the E Streeters and the Boss, but from his 90's gig, in which he reinvented himself as a boss, the drummer-leader of the Max Weinberg Seven, the band on ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien.''</p>
        <p>So on nights like tonight, when a New York concert date coincides with the TV show, Mr. Weinberg runs a physical and psychic marathon between NBC, where he wears a silk suit and tie and plays crisp, elegant jump blues and swing, and his rocking past, at the Garden.</p>
        <p>There, after taping ''Late Night'' and dunking swollen hands in ice, he puts on Mighty Max's black jeans and vest, sits stiffly to ease back spasms, and whomps away  for three hours, gazing at the Boss.</p>
        <p>If there is a heaven on earth for 49-year-old guys in glasses who were supposed to store their adolescent drums in the garage and get real jobs, Mr. Weinberg, a nice, square joe so endlessly grateful for his good fortune that he just gave Springsteen tickets to the Jersey girl who jilted him in ninth grade, is living it.</p>
        <p>''It's milk and honey, a privilege,'' Mr. Weinberg says later, squeezing into the closet-size rehearsal room at NBC to pore through 3,000 titles, selecting 24-bar musical tidbits for Mr. O'Brien's guests as they walk in.</p>
        <p>Here, riffing with seasoned musicians, Mr. Weinberg, an otherwise contained and cautious sort -- declining, for example, to comment on Mr. Springsteen's headline-making song ''American Skin,'' about the Amadou Diallo shooting -- relaxes, beaming as he smashes cymbals.</p>
        <p>''I like us to look sharp and play sharp,'' he remarks, odd for a rock demigod. It's odder yet that Mr. Weinberg made his name in rock. For with his dressing room wall an altar to Buddy Rich and his favorite performer, pre-Springsteen, Sammy Davis Jr., Mr. Weinberg more closely resembles his 50's persona on ''Late Night.''</p>
        <p>He had a childhood steeped in Broadway musicals, and a relentless work ethic ever since he was an under-age drumming phenomenon in a three-piece mohair suit, taking any gig in northern New Jersey for love and for the money. The scary years when his father, a lawyer who lost two summer camps he owned in the Poconos, remain fresh.</p>
        <p>In 1974 he was living at home, a student at Seton Hall and drumming for ''Godspell'' on Broadway, when he saw a Village Voice ad. ''I showed up for the audition with just a snare, a high-hat and a bass because I didn't want to carry all my drums from 'Godspell,' '' Mr. Weinberg recalls. ''Bruce saw I was a real meat-and-potatoes drummer, and that I had the true backup mentality.'' Mighty Max was born.</p>
        <p>After they parted 15 years later, Mr. Weinberg, who speaks reverently about Mr. Springsteen (they both still live in New Jersey), floundered. With a wife and two children, he needed work.</p>
        <p>He lasted six weeks in law school and a few years as a music scout. His wrists itched: he missed making thousands rise and dance. So at 41, Mighty Max returned to his prepubescent self: scouring the Yellow Pages, he'd take any gig, earning $125 drumming at bar mitzvahs. He was hired for the Broadway rock opera ''Tommy.'' Second substitute drummer.</p>
        <p>WHEN Mr. O'Brien replaced David Letterman at ''Late Night'' in 1993, Mr. Weinberg lunged for the band leader job. In getting it, he has become a cool guy to the next generation, exploring his cross-dressing comic self and, best, working steady, drumming his heart and hands out.</p>
        <p>''To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds again?'' he says at 7 p.m., after taping a vigorous, demanding ''Late Night.'' ''What a thrill! I love signing autographs for people who are kind enough to ask for them.''</p>
        <p>Gosh, Max!</p>
        <p>His face wiped clean of TV makeup, he waits for his driver. Soon he'll gobble steamed chicken, gulp two protein shakes, zoom to the Garden. Change clothes, wrap fingers, warm up with metronome and practice pad: Mighty Max, sideman.</p>
        <p>Then, drumsticks will become a roaring blur, spitting broken tips, as his old Boss duels with him on guitar. Streaking pain will be buried in the rush of seeing thousands rise and dance.</p>
        <p>The driver is late. Anxious?</p>
        <p>''No!'' If they fire him, he still has his day job. Besides, he says, with a quietly confident smile: ''They can't start without me.''</p>
