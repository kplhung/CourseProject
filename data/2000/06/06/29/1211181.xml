        <p>Is Chase Manhattan Bank ready, finally, to join the big leagues of investment banking?</p>
        <p>This is the bank, after all, that was practically a laughingstock on Wall Street a couple of years ago when it so visibly failed to persuade Merrill Lynch or any other big name brokerage firm to accept a takeover bid. Instead, it settled for consolation prizes, agreeing to pay billions of dollars to acquire the much smaller Hambrecht &amp; Quist, which specializes in technology, and Robert Fleming Holdings, a venerable London merchant banking firm.</p>
        <p>So when Chase announced late last month that it had agreed to buy the obscure Beacon Group for an estimated $450 million -- an investment banking boutique started by Geoffrey T. Boisi, a former star at Goldman Sachs -- it looked to some like yet another expensive acquisition in a piecemeal attempt at building an investment banking presence.</p>
        <p>For years Chase has been the place corporations turned to when they needed money to finance their own acquisitions, a business synonymous with the hostile takeovers of the 1980's. But to compete with Morgan Stanley, Goldman, Merrill Lynch and the like -- all of which excel not only in finance but also in the much more prestigious and lucrative specialties of providing merger advice and offering new stock to the public -- Chase needed to look and act more like them.</p>
        <p>Chase, for all its success in commercial banking on a global scale, has an image problem in the clubbier precincts of Wall Street. And that was only reinforced earlier this year when James B. Lee Jr., the 18-year veteran head of investment banking at Chase, was championed on the cover of Forbes magazine, complete with a list of takeover targets and this message to Chase clients: ''We'll write you a check.''</p>
        <p>Wall Street insiders were struck by how Mr. Lee (universally called Jimmy within the business) appeared as a promotional, highly aggressive 1980's-style power broker. So much so, according to Michael Mayo, a senior bank analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, a competitor, that institutional shareholders he talked to ''actually sold shares based on that Forbes story.'' He added, ''It was arrogant.''</p>
        <p>Still, it was a shock when Chase announced, as part of the Beacon acquisition, that Mr. Lee, 47, would spend more time with clients and his family and that Mr. Boisi would become his boss. The not-so-subtle signal, analysts said, was that Chase was willing to go to any lengths to join the inner circle, even at the risk of alienating Mr. Lee, one of the most powerful executives at Chase.</p>
        <p>''Jimmy did a fantastic job building Chase's business,'' Mr. Mayo said. ''But this shows how much the bank is committed to going to the next level. There are different personalities needed for different times in a company's life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boisi, 53, is indeed a different personality -- a well-regarded adviser who for 21 years thrived in the intense but self-effacing business atmosphere at Goldman. He reached the third-most-powerful spot there before leaving in the early 1990's after, some people said, he failed in efforts to be named to the top position at the firm. That position was filled by two senior partners, Robert E. Rubin and Stephen Friedman.</p>
        <p>His comeback was engineered by William Harrison, Chase's chairman, who surprised Mr. Boisi during a routine strategy session in early May when he asked him to join the company, Mr. Boisi said. For more than two years he had been advising Chase's top echelon, first Walter Shipley and then, after Mr. Shipley retired as chairman, Mr. Harrison.</p>
        <p>''I felt they had similar fundamental values,'' said Mr. Boisi, who will become Chase's head of investment banking in July. ''Right at the top there was a collegial partnership and that felt good.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harrison insisted that the Forbes article about Mr. Lee ''had nothing to do with the changes at Chase.'' Mr. Lee, he said, had been looking to spend less time on administration and Chase needed a skilled manager, having gained more than 200 new professionals with the recent acquisitions. The bank also expanded its venture capital operation, Chase Capital Partners, which invests in emerging companies.</p>
        <p>But other Chase executives said that Mr. Harrison was not pleased with Mr. Lee's portrayal in the article and wanted to move quickly to shake things up. Negotiations between Mr. Boisi and Mr. Harrison lasted less than two weeks.</p>
        <p>And even the day before the announcement, one executive said, it was not clear whether Mr. Lee would stay. A former executive said that Mr. Lee described the management shuffle to some friends and colleagues as an unwelcome demotion.</p>
        <p>In an interview two weeks ago, Mr. Lee said he welcomed the change. Earlier this year he cut the number of people who report to him, voluntarily sharing the responsibility with other Chase executives, so that he could spend more time with clients. And, so far, the talk about him leaving is untrue. ''I just got off the phone with a senior person at a competitor and I told him I was happy,'' Mr. Lee said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boisi's return, meanwhile, to a big institution striving to get ahead sets up a powerful personal drama with Chase's Wall Street rivals. Not only will he be going head to head against his former colleagues at Goldman, Mr. Boisi also faces a formidable competitor at Citigroup, where Mr. Rubin, the former Treasury Secretary who once shared the top spot at Goldman, is now co-chairman.</p>
        <p>When asked if he was prepared for the contest, Mr. Boisi did not answer directly, instead offering an anecdote to make his point.</p>
        <p>''Years and years ago I used to ask young recruits, 'What do you want on your tombstone?' '' he said. One day one of the recruits turned the question on him. He thought about it, he said, and replied, ''To be a successful, respected competitor.''</p>
        <p>In other words, he relishes the challenge. And challenge it will be.</p>
        <p>''There is a lot of cultural meshing to be done,'' said Judah Kraushaar, a bank analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''The question is how do they take all these capabilities and drive them into Chase's bigger customer base.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boisi was born in 1947, the second of six children, and raised in a devout Catholic home in Westbury, on Long Island. His father, James, was a vice chairman at J. P. Morgan; his mother, Edith, a homemaker. He attended Boston College where, on the last day of his freshman year, he met his wife, Rene.</p>
        <p>After graduating in 1969 with a degree in English, Mr. Boisi immediately went to the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, where he got his M.B.A. in 1971. He was recruited by Goldman, becoming just the fourth person in what was then a fledgling mergers- and-acquisitions practice.</p>
        <p>It did not take long for the young and ambitious Mr. Boisi to become a star. Mergers and acquisitions was once a genteel business but as the new era of hostile takeovers was born, Goldman moved from insisting on only representing corporations seeking to fend off a takeover to a full participant on all sides. Mr. Boisi was soon involved in nearly every major takeover battle of the 1980's -- including advising the buyout firm of Forstmann Little &amp; Company in the epic 1988 battle for RJR Nabisco that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company ultimately won.</p>
        <p>At 31, Mr. Boisi became Goldman's youngest partner. In 1980 he became head of the mergers and acquisition department and in 1986, he took sole responsibility for running the investment banking division, where he spent four years at the helm, helping to create Goldman's now formidable global finance presence.</p>
        <p>Even now, he still bursts with pride over what his old firm has accomplished. ''Goldman Sachs is considered to be a pretty good place,'' he said, ''and I had something to do with that.''</p>
        <p>He seems to have made few enemies in his rise, a rarity in the backstabbing world of Wall Street.</p>
        <p>''Geoff was very well organized, disciplined and exceedingly focused,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''He is a very decent guy.''</p>
        <p>If anything, former colleagues say, what distinguished Mr. Boisi at Goldman, which prides itself on collegiality, was his zeal for debating even the smallest points. ''His personality fills a room,'' said Robin Neustein, a managing director at Goldman who worked with him.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Boisi also took time to attract and shelter new talent. ''I was always a believer in giving opportunities to the younger people,'' he said. At Goldman, he even played football with junior analysts on weekends, and trolled university campuses looking for promising undergraduates. ''I was trying to identify who the leaders were and talk to them and get them on board,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boisi brought that same intensity to his activities off Wall Street. Richard F. Syron, the former chairman of the American Stock Exchange who said he served as vice chairman for Boston College's board of trustees when Mr. Boisi was chairman, recalled one spring in the early 1990's when they were responsible for finding a new president for the college.</p>
        <p>''He had constructed this extraordinary process, a two-week schedule for gathering information,'' Mr. Syron said. ''We talked to the dean of every school, every member of the board, past and present, every department head and a lot of alumni.'' And the was before the search began. All told the two spent 100 hours -- working late into the evenings -- listening to every important person affected by the decision.</p>
        <p>''He's quite cerebral in a way that does not come across as purely intellectual,'' Mr. Syron said. ''Geoff is someone who starts looking at something at a macro level and drills down to the details to see how they fit in a larger picture.''</p>
        <p>So why didn't Mr. Boisi end up running Goldman? Wall Street executives were surprised when he resigned in 1991. But he would have had to wait a considerable time until Mr. Rubin and Mr. Friedman, who had recently been named co-chairmen, left their posts. The irony is, had Mr. Boisi stayed, he would most likely have been named their successor in 1994, less time then he expected to wait.</p>
        <p>''I knew what I was giving up,'' he said of that time. He was silent for a moment, before recounting the moment he made up his mind to leave. It was early 1991, and he had taken a business trip to Australia to make a three-hour presentation to a client. After the meeting, he caught a flight to Rome where he spent half a day recruiting a potential Goldman board adviser. All told, he said, he spent more than 24 hours on planes -- plus the time in meetings -- away from his wife and four children.</p>
        <p>''One Thursday was completely obliterated from my life,'' he said. ''Given what I wanted to do with the kids and my life, I thought it was healthy to leave.''</p>
        <p>For two years after that he devoted his efforts to the National Mentoring Partnership, an organization he co-founded in 1989 that matches up students with corporate sponsors. And in 1993, he started the investment advisory firm Beacon, which would become a collection of friends and former Goldman colleagues, including David A. Coulter, the former chairman of Bank of America, and Richard Herbst, a former Goldman banker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boisi now says that he is not daunted that at an age when many Wall Street executives are looking to spend more time in the Hamptons, he will be starting over, again logging long hours at the office, on planes and in meetings, hoping to create at Chase the successful atmosphere that made Goldman what it is today.</p>
        <p>''It will be building, person by person,'' he said. ''We are going to be guerrilla warriors. That is going to be instilled.''</p>
