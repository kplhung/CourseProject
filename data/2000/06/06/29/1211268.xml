        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report (news article, June 23) about the threat that Ralph Nader's presidential candidacy poses to Vice President Al Gore's chances of election.</p>
        <p>Now that Mr. Nader has the Green Party nomination he sought (news article, June 26), I trust that some reporter will ask him how comfortable he feels about the strong possibility that his candidacy will determine whether it will be Mr. Gore or Gov. George W. Bush of Texas who makes the next several appointments to the Supreme Court, where many cases are decided by the narrowest of margins.</p>
