        <p>The Gannett Company, whose stable of newspapers is already the largest in the country, announced yesterday that it had agreed to acquire Central Newspapers Inc., the owner of The Arizona Republic, The Indianapolis Star and four other daily newspapers, for $2.6 billion in cash.</p>
        <p>That price tag makes the deal the second largest in newspaper history. It is topped by the recent purchase of the Times Mirror Company, which publishes The Los Angeles Times, by the Tribune Company, which owns The Chicago Tribune, for $8 billion.</p>

        <p>The Gannett Company, whose stable of newspapers is already the largest in the country, announced yesterday that it had agreed to acquire Central Newspapers Inc., the owner of The Arizona Republic, The Indianapolis Star and four other daily newspapers, for $2.6 billion in cash.</p>
        <p>That price tag makes the deal the second largest in newspaper history. It is topped by the recent purchase of the Times Mirror Company, which publishes The Los Angeles Times, by the Tribune Company, which owns The Chicago Tribune, for $8 billion.</p>
        <p>The acquisition is the end of the long reign of the Pulliam family, the descendants of the company founder, Eugene C. Pulliam, a conservative publishing clan whose members include Dan Quayle, the Republican former vice president. The family has long been a political force in Indiana and Arizona -- indeed, one investment banker pointed out that neither state observes daylight time ''because Eugene Pulliam always refused to change his clock.''</p>
        <p>Louis A. Weil III, chairman and chief executive of Central, said last night that the sale to Gannett was an acknowledgment that Central simply lacked the scale necessary to be successful in today's market of large media properties.</p>
        <p>''We were too big to be small and too small to be big, as a public company,'' Mr. Weil said.</p>
        <p>Douglas H. McCorkindale, president and chief executive of Gannett, said in a statement that the company expected to operate Central's newspaper properties ''in keeping with the high standards established by the Pulliam family.''</p>
        <p>To effect the deal, Gannett is offering to buy all of Central's publicly traded Class A stock for $64 a share. The stock, which has risen 118 percent since the company put itself up for sale three weeks ago, closed yesterday at $64.25, up 12.5 cents. Gannett, which is based in Arlington, Va., is also offering to purchase Central's Class B shares for $6.40 a share.</p>
        <p>A Pulliam family trust, which owns just under 83 percent of those  shares and thus controls approximately 78 percent of Central's shareholder votes, has granted Gannett an option to purchase its shares. The remaining 17.2 percent of the Class B shares are owned directly by members of the Pulliam family.</p>
        <p>Under Indiana law, which governs in this case, a shareholder meeting will not be necessary if at least 90 percent of each class of stock is tendered to Gannett, said Eric Tooker, Central's general counsel. If a shareholder meeting is necessary, the Pulliam trust's shares alone are sufficient to ensure that the merger will be approved.</p>
        <p>The cash purchase price will be taxable to Central investors. But John P. Miller, an analyst and assistant portfolio manager at Ariel Capital Management in Chicago -- Central's largest shareholder outside the Pulliam family -- said the arrangement protects investors from market risk going forward.</p>
        <p>Gannett already publishes 89 daily newspapers worldwide, including USA Today, the nation's largest-selling weekday newspaper. It announced on June 8 that it planned to acquire 21 additional daily papers in Louisiana, Maryland, Ohio, Wisconsin and Utah from the Thomson Corporation for $1.125 billion.</p>
        <p>Gannett also operates 22 television stations, including KPNX-TV in Phoenix, where Central's home office and one of its key properties, The Arizona Republic, are based. According to Gannett, the transaction does not involve the transfer of any broadcast licenses, and therefore does not require the approval of the Federal Communications Commission. However, if the federal cross-ownership rules, which govern the ownership of multiple media outlets in a single market, have not been modified before KPNX's license is up for renewal in October 2006, Gannett would need a waiver from the F.C.C. to continue owning both the television station and the Phoenix newspaper, the company said.</p>
        <p>Shares of Gannett rose 86 cents yesterday, to $58.99.</p>
        <p>The price tag announced yesterday is roughly 11.8 times Central's expected earnings in the current year, before interest, taxes and depreciation, only slightly higher than the value given to the Times Mirror earnings in the Tribune Company deal. If Gannett is able to trim costs -- by eliminating Central's corporate overhead, for example -- the price tag would represent an even better value, one analyst said.</p>
        <p>The deal is an excellent one for Central's shareholders, said Thomas A. Russo, a partner in Gardner Russo Gardner, which is listed as Central's second-largest institutional shareholder. ''But my dream outcome would have been to get Gannett stock at this price,'' Mr. Russo said.</p>
        <p>Central was advised in the deal by Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company advising the Pulliam family trust. Gannett did not use an investment banking firm for the deal.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 1, 2000, Saturday  An article in Business Day on Thursday about the Gannett Company's purchase of Central Newspapers Inc. referred imprecisely to the owners of Central's Class B shares. While members of the Pulliam family own the majority of those shares, they do not own all of them.</p>
