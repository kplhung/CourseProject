        <p>Who is more tarred by the big oil companies and therefore more responsible for the high price of gasoline? That was the burning question in the presidential contest today as both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore campaigned in Ohio.</p>
        <p>The latest accusation came from Mr. Bush, who said that although Mr. Gore had accused him of cozying up to big oil, it was really Mr. Gore who was doing so because he had proposed extending a tax break to the industry for deep-water drilling in search of natural gas.</p>

        <p>Who is more tarred by the big oil companies and therefore more responsible for the high price of gasoline? That was the burning question in the presidential contest today as both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore campaigned in Ohio.</p>
        <p>The latest accusation came from Mr. Bush, who said that although Mr. Gore had accused him of cozying up to big oil, it was really Mr. Gore who was doing so because he had proposed extending a tax break to the industry for deep-water drilling in search of natural gas.</p>
        <p>The Gore camp replied that this was a foolish accusation, that the tax break provided an incentive for natural-gas exploration, which could help increase domestic supplies, reduce dependence on foreign oil and thereby cut energy prices for consumers.</p>
        <p>The exchange was the latest in an escalating back-and-forth as each candidate tries to paint the other as  less likely to fight to reduce the price of gas at the pump. Polls show that gas prices remain Americans' No. 1 concern as they begin their summer vacations.</p>
        <p>The prices have risen most sharply here in the Midwest, in the states most up for grabs in the presidential election. Both candidates have encouraged a federal investigation into gasoline prices, which have exceeded $2 a gallon in some areas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said he would encourage foreign oil producers to increase the supply of crude oil and the domestic industry to increase exploration, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Mr. Bush also wants to deregulate utilities to spur demand for natural gas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore laid out a sweeping plan on Tuesday to reduce dependence on foreign oil. It would provide more than $125 billion in tax breaks over 10 years to businesses that provide cleaner forms of energy; one proposal would extend the moratorium on royalties paid by natural-gas companies while they drill under the Gulf of Mexico. The moratorium is scheduled to expire in November.</p>
        <p>At a campaign stop here today, Mr. Bush, a former oil executive himself and the recipient of $1.5 million in campaign contributions from the gas and oil industries, told reporters: ''My opponent is giving major oil companies a huge tax break. I believe a royalty moratorium ought to happen when the price declines. We ought not to have moratoriums when the prices are high.''</p>
        <p>Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said that the tax breaks would help bring down the cost of fuel and that Mr. Bush's position showed his true colors because it aligned him with the oil companies.</p>
        <p>''This policy provides an incentive to increase domestic energy production, reduce our dependence on foreign oil and cut energy,'' Mr. Hattaway said. ''Bush clearly favors big oil at the expense of cheaper, cleaner forms of energy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who has received less than $100,000 in contributions from oil and gas interests, has been casting Mr. Bush as the darling of big oil and more likely to look out for his friends in the industry than for the average consumer. So it was with some zeal that Mr. Bush and his aides seized on the chance to portray the vice president as the one giving the industry a break.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bush went further. He suggested that the oddity of the vice president's call for tax breaks for the oil industry -- the same industry that Mr. Gore says has Mr. Bush in its clutches -- was emblematic of a candidate who would, in the bumper-sticker parlance of the Bush campaign, ''say anything to get elected.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush used both a sledgehammer and a scalpel to make his point.</p>
        <p>First, the sledgehammer: ''Al Gore yesterday apparently said he never made comments about raising prices of gasoline, yet in his book, 'Earth in the Balance,' he advocated higher taxes on fuel use and he supported a B.T.U. tax, which would raise gasoline prices on people,'' Mr. Bush said. ''When you tax energy, it raises the cost. He advocated it, strongly advocated it, two such measures, and now that the political heat is on he's changing his tune. Changing his tune. He advocates for raising taxes, raising gas prices, and he denies he ever did that.''</p>
        <p>Then the scalpel: ''This is another example where he doesn't know what the meaning of 'raise' is,'' Mr. Bush said. This was a reference to Mr. Gore's quibbling over the definition of the word ''raising'' -- as in money -- in his April 18 sworn testimony about his fund-raising.</p>
