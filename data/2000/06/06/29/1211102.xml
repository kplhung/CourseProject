        <p>The biggest bridge club in the United States is Honors in New York City, which had 19,600 duplicate tables in play last year. It is not, however, the biggest in the world.

        <p>The biggest bridge club in the United States is Honors in New York City, which had 19,600 duplicate tables in play last year. It is not, however, the biggest in the world. That title appears to belong to the St. Erik Club in Stockholm, where the 1999 total was 22,000 tables. In third place is Center Klubberne Birkerod in Denmark, which averages 19,000 tables annually. But other candidates may yet come forward.</p>
        <p>Honors was founded seven years ago by Gail Greenberg, who has had considerable support from Jimmy Cayne and Laurie Vogel. After three years it outgrew the East Side brownstone in which it began, and it is now quartered comfortably at 115 East 57th Street, where experts conduct teaching programs.</p>
        <p>One of Greenberg's favorite deals was played in a major women's team championship many years ago when her last name was Moss. As South she opened one club, and West bid two no-trump, showing length in the red suits. Greenberg eventually bid seven spades, knowing that her partner held good spades and both red aces. What she did not know was that her partner held three small clubs, the worst possible holding.</p>
        <p>Unexpectedly, West doubled the grand slam and led the heart queen. South won in dummy and drew trumps with the ace and king. She threw her heart loser on the diamond ace, and it was time to think about the clubs.</p>
        <p>West had shown length in both hearts and diamonds and had produced a doubleton spade. She therefore had at most one club. But was it a singleton honor, a small singleton, or a void? Inspiration came. The only explanation for West's double was that she believed her partner to be on lead. It was a Lightner double asking for a club lead. So West had to be void in clubs, and South led dummy's club nine. When East played low, she finessed confidently and made the doubled grand slam.</p>
        <p>In the replay, North was the declarer in seven spades doubled. This was a Lightner double from the correct side of the table, and the club lead duly defeated the slam. In the post-mortem North-South discovered that they could have saved the day by retreating to seven no-trump. Then the Lightner double would have guided the declarer to the winning play in clubs.</p>
