        <p>When Lothar Matthaus departed for Germany after the MetroStars' seventh game nearly two months ago, the team was languishing at the bottom of the Major Soccer League standing with a 2-5 record. And after a stay with the German national team that was even more frustrating, he rejoined the MetroStars tonight for their game against San Jose, finding the team fighting for first place in the Eastern Division.</p>
        <p>So it was not surprising that Matthaus would push his 39-year-old body a little harder than he should, trying to help his team win. From the start, he was more active and aggressive than he had been in his first stay with the team, and in the 55th minute, on a harmless ball outside the box, Matthaus leaped and used a bicycle kick to send the ball back to midfield. But as he landed on his back, he immediately grabbed his lower back.</p>

        <p>When Lothar Matthaus departed for Germany after the MetroStars' seventh game nearly two months ago, the team was languishing at the bottom of the Major Soccer League standing with a 2-5 record. And after a stay with the German national team that was even more frustrating, he rejoined the MetroStars tonight for their game against San Jose, finding the team fighting for first place in the Eastern Division.</p>
        <p>So it was not surprising that Matthaus would push his 39-year-old body a little harder than he should, trying to help his team win. From the start, he was more active and aggressive than he had been in his first stay with the team, and in the 55th minute, on a harmless ball outside the box, Matthaus leaped and used a bicycle kick to send the ball back to midfield. But as he landed on his back, he immediately grabbed his lower back.</p>
        <p>For five minutes, Matthaus waved off the calls from the bench, but then Abdul Thompson Conteh took the ball and moved right at Matthaus, who gingerly tried to backtrack. He deflected the ball slightly with his foot, and goalkeeper Tim Howard made the save, but Matthaus went right to the bench with a strained back and hamstring, ending his night. He had to watch as the MetroStars settled for a scoreless tie with the Earthquakes at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>Playing through injuries and the unfamiliar pressure of battling for first place, the MetroStars had their opportunities but still slipped into a first-place tie with the New England Revolution. The MetroStars (8-7-2, 26 points) actually hold first place by virtue of a tie breaker, but that was hardly enough to make them happy.</p>
        <p>What Coach Octavio Zambrano saw was an opportunity for a victory  that had gotten away. ''We didn't seize the opportunity to win a game that was there for us to win,'' Zambrano said. ''It doesn't feel like we're in first place. I think that we would legitimately be in first place with a win.''</p>
        <p>The MetroStars started the day without their keeper, Mike Ammann, who had played every minute of the regular season. Ammann twisted his back in Tuesday's practice and after trying to work out in the morning, the team opted to sit him for tonight's game, and likely for Saturday's game at Tampa Bay as well.</p>
        <p>In Ammann's place, Howard got his first M.L.S. start after playing two games with the United States' Under-23 National Team and registering a victory in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. With four saves, he got the first shutout of his career.</p>
        <p>''As long as we get the points, a tie is O.K. once in a while,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars tested San Jose keeper Joe Cannon more than Howard was tested. Their best scoring opportunity came in the 66th minute, when Adolfo Valencia raced in on the left side and Cannon blocked his shot with his legs as he slid. Roy Myers, a second-half substitution, ran onto the loose ball with the net wide open, but just before he could get a foot on it, Jim Conrad slid through and knocked the ball wide of the net.</p>
