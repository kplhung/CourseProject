        <p>An extraordinary law enforcement presence will be massed along New York City's waterways for OpSail 2000 on the Fourth of July.</p>
        <p>Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that 28,000 police officers -- the greatest number the city has ever deployed in a 24-hour period -- would be on duty, reinforced by nearly 2,500 members of the Coast Guard and teams of federal agents from around the country.</p>

        <p>An extraordinary law enforcement presence will be massed along New York City's waterways for OpSail 2000 on the Fourth of July.</p>
        <p>Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that 28,000 police officers -- the greatest number the city has ever deployed in a 24-hour period -- would be on duty, reinforced by nearly 2,500 members of the Coast Guard and teams of federal agents from around the country.</p>
        <p>The huge presence is needed, a variety of law enforcement and military officials said this week, because OpSail is a sprawling program with multiple events, each of which requires a particular security effort, from protecting the president to keeping curious boaters away from anchored Navy ships.</p>
        <p>''We've never had this many venues at once on the Fourth of July,'' Mr. Safir said.</p>
        <p>Mukesh Chandrani, special agent in charge of the Secret Service in New York, said that because of the scale of the event, the National Security Council had given OpSail a security classification that puts it on the order of the Olympics or the World Cup soccer tournament. He said the planning for the security had been taking place for months.</p>
        <p>''We have a very good security plan, and this is going to be a good, enjoyable event for the public,'' Mr. Chandrani said. ''The public should not be concerned about any security threats at this point.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chandrani and other officials rattled off a long list of missions, including maintaining security zones around military vessels at anchor in the harbor, protecting the president, vice president and first lady and deterring any terrorists who might use the high-profile program to gain attention for their cause.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, the authorities must perform the more mundane tasks of directing traffic on land and sea, stopping drunken boaters and public drinkers and protecting the public from five enormous fireworks displays. Moreover, the authorities must be on hand to assist small craft that become imperiled in the swift, tricky tides of the city's rivers. As many as 70,000 small boats may turn up for the event.</p>
        <p>The authorities said they must also maintain order among the thousands of sailors and marines on liberty who will be roaming New York's streets at night. Liberty is a nautical term that, in durable naval tradition, often translates to bar-hopping and woman-hunting, punctuated by the occasional fight.</p>
        <p>With so many concerns, security responsibilities will be shared by several agencies, including the Police Department, the Secret Service, the F.B.I. and the Customs Service, as well as the New Jersey State Police, the Navy and the Coast Guard. The planning extends all the way to the city's Medical Examiner's office, which decided to maintain a refrigerated morgue truck on East 30th Street just in case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir said that although no credible threat had yet surfaced, the preparations this week were to cover any possibility.</p>
        <p>On the water, the Coast Guard was preparing to deploy more than 200 small boats and 53 cutters, said Captain Richard E. Bennis, captain of the Port of New York.</p>
        <p>The vessels will include the traditional white Coast Guard craft with the red stripe, which will be conducting law enforcement and safety patrols, and gray-and-black vessels that will enforce safety zones around military ships and dignitaries.</p>
        <p>Captain Bennis said that the city's waterways had been divided into 12 sectors, and that each sector would be patrolled by roughly 20 boats under the command of a large cutter.  Much of the Coast Guard effort will be focused on protecting an 11.2-mile line of ships that will be anchored between Manhattan's West Side and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir said that the Police Department had one principal suggestion for the public: use public transportation. All along the city's main roads, from the Belt Parkway to the West Side Highway, many main roads will be closed.</p>
        <p>''If you bring your car, you are going to be very frustrated,'' Mr.  Safir said. ''You are not going to be moving.''</p>
