        <p>The departure of Elian Gonzalez for Cuba yesterday afternoon received extensive live coverage from every television news organization, with the all-news cable channels devoting most of their time during five straight hours to the story.</p>
        <p>The departure of the private jet taking Elian back to Havana was covered by ABC News, CBS News and NBC News as well, all of which interrupted regular programming for about an hour.</p>
        <p>The news coverage began shortly after noon when the Supreme Court announced that it had declined to intervene in the case. The coverage included reports from Havana, Washington and Miami, where Cuban-Americans were still protesting the decision that allowed Juan Miguel Gonzalez to take his son back to Cuba.</p>
        <p>On the three all-news cable channels, CNN, MSNBC and Fox News, the afternoon included a long period of live helicopter coverage of the Gonzalez family in a white van heading for the airport. The coverage was visually similar to the white Bronco chase at the start of the almost around-the-clock coverage of the O.J. Simpson murder case in 1994.</p>
        <p>As one CNN executive put it, ''I don't want to call it a Bronco but it certainly looked like a Bronco.'' Steve Capus, the executive producer of special coverage for MSNBC, said, ''It was certainly reminiscent of live events the country has watched in the past.''</p>
        <p>Eason Jordan, the president of newsgathering for CNN, said, ''People expect us to be on top of every breaking story. This is a story that involved President Clinton, Vice President Gore, Attorney General Reno, Congress and the Supreme Court and has had impact on Cuban-American relations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Capus said MSNBC had devoted time to President Clinton's news conference, as well as the Supreme Court's decisions on partial birth abortion and gays in the Boy Scouts. But much of the day was devoted to coverage of the Gonzalez departure, he said.</p>
        <p>''In the cable news business, a day like this is what we live for,'' Mr. Capus said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jordan said CNN, the only news channel with a permanent bureau in Havana, will continue to cover whatever developments take place in Cuba. ''Elian Gonzalez is probably the most famous child on the face of the earth,'' Mr. Jordan said. ''Beyond the policy issues it is also obviously a great human interest story.''</p>
