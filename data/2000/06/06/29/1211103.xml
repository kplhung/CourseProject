        <p>THE Internet transformed the world by linking computer networks. The World Wide Web transformed the Internet by making it easy to link files on those computers.</p>
        <p>Now another major transformation is occurring, in the form of programs like Napster and Gnutella. These programs, best known for allowing college students to swap music files, make it easy to link one computer directly to another for the purpose of transferring files anonymously. In the case of Gnutella and similar services like Freenet, CuteMX, JungleMonkey and Hotline, central computers are bypassed altogether.</p>
        <p>And that, to paraphrase Elvis Presley, has the Web all shook up. By enabling millions of computer users to search for files and transfer them from one desktop computer to another, instead of the current model in which files are typically stored on and retrieved from a central Internet computer called a server, the balance of power shifts from the commercial interests that now dominate the Internet to the individual.</p>
        <p>Napster is a good place to start to understand how these new ''peer to peer'' services differ from the majority of Internet sites today because it is relatively simple, is limited to MP3 music files and is the most consumer-friendly of the services. A similar service for Macintosh computers is Macster (www.macster .com). Gnutella, Hotline and Freenet are a bit more complicated and are still used mainly by techies.</p>
        <p>Napster is the new Elvis of the Internet, the rebel that rocks the establishment because of its wild popularity among young people and its whiff of dangerousness. According to Napster, hundreds of thousands of people are signing up every day on www.napster.com, adding to the 14 million who have already registered to use it. The company acknowledges that many of these users are sharing copyrighted music, mainly digital MP3 music files that have been copied from commercial audio CD's. The program can, of course, be used in a completely legal fashion by people trading uncopyrighted music files, perhaps including your as-yet undiscovered garage band or your latest rap compositions. The tool itself is not intrinsically illegal.</p>
        <p>The music industry sees Napster as the devil in disguise. It fears that when CD-quality songs are free for the taking over the Internet, people will be less willing to pay $15 or more for a CD in a store. So the Recording Industry Association of America and major record companies are suing Napster, seeking to shut it down.</p>
        <p>Napster, which is based in San Mateo, Calif., was still very much in business on a recent afternoon. Eddie Kessler, Napster's vice president of engineering, checked the logs and said there were more than 450,000 people connected to Napster's servers at that moment, sharing millions of song files.</p>
        <p>What were these people doing? Probably the same thing I was, looking for songs. I went looking for ''Jailhouse Rock,'' and within five minutes it was on my computer. My cost? Zero. Revenue to Elvis's estate and to the record company? Zero. Illegal? Napster says no. But ask a copyright lawyer, and the answer is most likely to be yes.</p>
        <p>Napster makes it easy for people to violate copyright laws. Most of the traffic is in music that one would otherwise have to buy in the stores.</p>
        <p>It works like this: You download the Napster client program to your Windows computer from Napster's Web site. (Macintosh, Linux and other versions are expected soon.) Once the software is installed, and after you promise not to violate any copyright laws, you register a screen name and designate which files on your computer you want to share with others. Typically these are your MP3 files. You are not required to share your files, but Napster is based on community sharing, and most people give as well as take.</p>
        <p>Clicking on the Napster icon connects you to one of Napster's server computers. The servers do not store any files. They merely act as matchmakers. Type in a search query for ''Elvis,'' and in seconds you see a list of the first 100 Elvis Presley (and some Elvis Costello) tunes being offered by all currently connected Napster users. For lesser known artists, only a handful of tunes may show up.</p>
        <p>Transferring a file from someone else's computer is as simple as clicking on a bar that says ''Get Selected Songs.'' At that point, Napster enables a seamless Internet connection between your computer and the one containing the file you want. Seconds, minutes or hours later, depending on the speed of the Internet connections on both ends of the exchange, the file pops into your computer.</p>
        <p>The song can then be played through computer speakers, transferred to an audio CD with a CD-R drive, or -- with the new digital audio receivers that are soon to come to market -- played through a home stereo system. It can also be left in the shared-music folder so other Napster users can copy it from you.</p>
        <p>Napster's transfer screen shows both the files arriving at your computer, and the files that other people are siphoning from your hard disk. Are you lonesome tonight? With the click of another button, you can enter a public chat session with other Napster users on your server -- up to about 6,000 people per server -- or send an instant message to anyone connected to Napster at the time.</p>
        <p>There is a reason Napster is so popular among college students, besides the fact that many of them are broke and do not object to getting music for free. A typical three-minute song file is more than 3 megabytes in size, or more than 25 million bits (there are 8 bits to the byte). A cable modem or D.S.L. modem that transfers several million bits per second is clearly preferable to a dial-up modem that is limited to 14,400, 28,800 or even 53,000 bits per second. Napster would not be nearly as popular if college students did not have easy access to 10-megabit (10 million bits per second) Ethernet connections in their dormitory rooms and libraries.</p>
        <p>Napster makes it easy to search not only by the name of the artist or the song title, but also by such important variables as bit rate, connection speed and ping rate.</p>
        <p>Bit rate refers to the sampling quality of the digital copy; in general, the higher the bit rate, the more closely the recording is to the original. A bit rate of 128 or higher is, for most listeners, virtually equivalent to audio CD quality. But the higher the bit rate, the larger the file.</p>
        <p>File transfers take forever if you are downloading to or uploading from someone who is using the equivalent of a hand-cranked modem. Napster allows people to restrict their music searches to computers that have high-speed connections. Listing your connection speed is voluntary, and some people with fast connections may lie because they do not want everyone to be copying their music files. The ping rate indicates the time it takes, in milliseconds, to send a test signal (the ping) to the target computer and to get a reply (the pong). A double-digit ping rate is good.</p>
        <p>Gnutella (gnutella.wego.com) also allows the sharing of copyrighted music files, but its impact is likely to be felt much more broadly once the software is made easier to use. Unlike Napster, Gnutella bypasses a server completely and is designed to allow individuals to send and receive all kinds of files without going through a central computer. Music, movies, TV shows, pictures, novels, software -- anything that can be digitized can now be stored and shared with other computers without going through a giant portal or central file server.</p>
        <p>Viewed one way, Gnutella is a hammer that can break censorship on a global level because once a file is in circulation, the only ways to contain it are to shut down the Internet or confiscate individual PC's. In other words, it would be nearly impossible. Viewed another way, Gnutella and its siblings can also break copyrights and business models and law enforcement in the digital realm. The commercial software industry, which says $12 billion was lost to software pirates last year, has nightmares over the potential losses from programs like Gnutella, Hotline (www.bigredh.com), JungleMonkey (www.junglemonkey.net) and Freenet (freenet.sourceforge.net). There is no pressure point or server system that can stop the hemorrhaging, as the recording industry association is attempting to do by suing Napster.</p>
        <p>In the end, I deleted the downloaded Elvis files from my computer. It simply did not seem fair to Elvis's estate or his record company to enjoy his music without paying something for it. Indeed, Napster may soon impose a subscription fee as a way to compensate the record companies and artists whose music is being bootlegged.</p>
        <p>But now that the technology exists for millions of Web users to share files easily, the genie is out of the bottle. Once again, the technology has outpaced the laws, business models and public discussion needed to cope with it. The debate is just beginning.</p>
