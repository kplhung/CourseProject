        <p>The e-book market got another boost this week as Franklin Electronic Publishers unveiled the first handheld reader to be sold for under $150. The slim, lightweight device, called the eBookMan, will be sold in at least three versions this fall, with prices starting at $129.95.</p>
        <p>''It's tough for people to spend $500 on a machine to read a $20 novel,'' said Barry Lipsky, Franklin's president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>The machine will also function as an MP3 player, a listening device for digital audio books, an address book, schedule keeper and a repository for voice memos. It includes a stylus and is designed to recognize handwriting.</p>
        <p>The least expensive version, Mr. Lipsky said, will probably be issued in a translucent blue. It will feature 8 megabytes of RAM, enough room for about 20 standard novels. The next step up, for $179.95, has the same features with a clearer screen, a backlight and a forest green shell. The silver-colored model, for $229.95, includes all those options plus 16 megabytes of RAM. Each model includes a slot for a multimedia card for extra memory.</p>
        <p>Franklin has years of experience in developing handheld electronic dictionaries and translators that sell for as little as $15. Instead of having to dumb down a high-priced computer, Mr. Lipsky said, Franklin was able to capitalize on its experience in the low-end market.</p>
        <p>Prototypes of the eBookMan, shown at PC Expo in New York this week, look like Palm organizers at first glance. They also come with a cradle that plugs into a computer via a U.S.B. port. But the screen is several inches longer and an inch wider than most handheld organizers.</p>
        <p>It is that extra size, said Dr. Peter N. Yianilos, the company's chief technology officer, that makes reading Huck Finn an easier experience than squinting to read it on other handheld organizers. For years, books, magazines and newspapers have been printing columns of eBookman size. ''People are used to dealing with text of that width,'' he said.</p>
