        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Limited Partnership: The Black Internet Entrepreneur Had the Idea; the White One Became the Venture's Public Face'' (''How Race Is Lived in America,'' front page, June 14):</p>
        <p>As an African-American man employed in the new media industry, I am amazed at the number of new businesses receiving capital financing. I am also amazed at how many of them are not minority businesses.</p>
        <p>You captured the subtle racism that so many Americans ignore when they say ''things are better than they were.'' But things are not better; we deny more because we try to convince ourselves that we have advanced.</p>
        <p>Though many Americans try to accept those who are ''different'' based on their character, often they don't live in the same neighborhood, are not enraged by the injustices that black people suffer, and do not have to fear for their lives or those of their children if they encounter the police.</p>
