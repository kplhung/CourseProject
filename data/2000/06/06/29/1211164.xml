        <p>In convincing the Supreme Court that it should have the right to bar gays from its ranks, the Boy Scouts of America has definitively established itself as an organization that considers homosexuality a detriment to the well-being of its young members.</p>
        <p>But as the public becomes more tolerant of lesbians and gay men -- and less accepting of discrimination against them -- some civil rights advocates said yesterday that the Boy Scouts' victory could ultimately harm the group.</p>
        <p>Though the organization's membership has grown to nearly 5 million, from 4.3 million in 1997, its aggressive legal campaign to exclude gay leaders has provoked disenchantment from religious groups, school boards and parent volunteers around the country.</p>
        <p>A dozen municipal governments, including Washington, Chicago and San Francisco, have severed relationships with the scouts or are considering measures to keep the group from using public buildings. In Connecticut last month, authorities removed the group from its list of charities eligible for state payroll deductions. And after learning of the decision yesterday, the United Methodist Church, which sponsors 15 percent of Boy Scout troops, said it would encourage local congregations to sever ties.</p>
        <p>''The Boy Scouts have a hollow, Pyrrhic victory,'' said Ruth Harlow, deputy legal director for Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, which argued the case of James Dale, an Eagle Scout assistant scoutmaster whose troop expelled him after learning he was gay.</p>
        <p>''Their leaders and lawyers have convinced five members of the Supreme Court of their narrow, discriminatory vision,'' Ms. Harlow said. ''Now they have to live with that vision.''</p>
        <p>Boy Scout officials dismissed the notion that the decision would spark a backlash against the group. ''We feel that American families never left the values that the Boy Scouts never left,'' said Gregg Shields, a spokesman for the group. Membership grew, Mr. Shields noted, even as the scouts waged a 10-year legal battle to retain the ban. Even if donors or sponsors pulled out, he said, the scouts would find other support. ''We'll be just fine,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But David A. Rice, vice president of Scouting for All, a group that opposes the scouts' policy, said the ruling would force corporate sponsors and cities with antidiscrimination laws to review their relationships with the group.</p>
        <p>''This narrows the organization and pushes it more firmly into the hands of religious conservatives and the right wing,'' Mr. Rice said. ''Many public-spirited companies will find they can no longer be involved with the scouts.''</p>
        <p>So far, defections have been minimal. Fewer than a dozen United Way chapters have withdrawn financing, among them the United Way of Somerset County, N.J., which last month pulled its annual $30,600 gift after the local scout council refused to sign its nondiscrimination policy.</p>
        <p>New York City officials said they would try to stop the scouts from using school buildings or receiving support from any publicly financed agency. Christine Quinn, a member of the City Council, said that by accommodating scout meetings, the city was violating its human rights law.</p>
        <p>In Monmouth County, N.J., where Mr. Dale served until his ouster in 1990, reaction was mixed. Some, like Dolores Dalzell, 62, a former den mother, expressed relief. ''I don't think it's proper,'' she said about gay scout leaders. ''I wouldn't want my children exposed to them.''</p>
        <p>Others said they were disturbed that the Boy Scouts could now legally discriminate. Lynda Montague, 28, a secretary from Sayreville, said the ruling persuaded her to prevent her 8-year-old son from joining the scouts when he gets older. ''I don't want him to belong to a group that promotes bigotry,'' she said.</p>
