        <p>Late last season, Stephon Marbury pulled a reporter aside and told him that the Nets needed a thug. Not a criminal, of course, but a player who would push opponents around, make them think twice about barreling down the middle of the defense, finish his nifty passes with power dunks and play with the tenacity Marbury grew up seeing on the playgrounds of Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Marbury has that rough attitude and now so does one of his teammates. The Nets used the first pick of tonight's National Basketball Association draft in Minneapolis to select Kenyon Martin, a 6-foot-9-inch, 230-pound forward from the University of Cincinnati who blocks shots, slams with strength and plays with a scowl.</p>
        <p>Marbury loves it.</p>
        <p>''I think Kenyon will definitely fulfill a need that we have,'' Marbury said tonight. ''He is very intimidating. He can block shots, run the floor.</p>
        <p>''I think the fact that he played at Cincinnati is definitely a plus; everybody knows that Bob Huggins's kids are very tough and very physical,'' he said of the Bearcats' coach. ''Kenyon approaches the game like a lot of guys in the N.B.A.''</p>
        <p>Martin began sobbing as soon as Commissioner David Stern called his name. It was not unlike the scene five years ago when Marbury was drafted No. 4 by Milwaukee in 1996.</p>
        <p>''It was unreal,'' said Martin, whose college career ended with a broken leg in March. ''I've been through so much over the last few months -- getting hurt and my family seeing me struggle.</p>
        <p>''It was a relief. It feels like I'm starting a new life.''</p>
        <p>In accordance with the league's rookie scale, Martin will be signed to a three-year, $10 million contract that gives the Nets the option to pick him up for a fourth year.</p>
        <p>In taking Martin, the consensus national player of the year, the Nets picked for the present rather than the future. They considered Martin; Stromile Swift, who played two seasons at Louisiana State; and the high school phenom Darius Miles.</p>
        <p>Swift and Miles have tremendous potential, but their impact next season would not be significant, the Nets reasoned. Martin, on the other hand, is ready to contribute now.</p>
        <p>A senior who improved greatly over his four years of college, the 22-year-old Martin will immediately strengthen a front line that lost Jayson Williams for good today when the team president, Rod Thorn, announced his retirement just hours before the draft.</p>
        <p>Byron Scott, who was hired as the Nets' coach on Tuesday, said improving the club's defense and rebounding were his first priorities. Then he wants to insert a running game.</p>
        <p>Martin does all three things well. In addition to averaging 18.9 points, he finished eighth in the nation in blocked shots (3.45) and 13th in rebounds (9.7). He also handles the ball well and fills the lane quickly and with authority on fast breaks.</p>
        <p>''Everybody in our war room felt like he was the guy who can help us right away,'' Scott said. ''He's a man. We don't have to baby him and wait three or four years for him to develop. He'll be ready to move in and start at small forward. I think he can become one of the better players in this league.''</p>
        <p>Taking Martin was not without risk. He broke his right fibula during the Conference USA Tournament and underwent surgery in which two screws were placed in his ankle. After examining Martin last week, the Nets' doctors assured Thorn that the injury would not cause problems.</p>
        <p>Thorn said overlooking Martin's injury was the most difficult part of the decision, and with good reason. Not only is Williams now gone, but the career of the starting shooting guard Kerry Kittles may also be in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, Kittles had his right knee operated on for the fourth time in three years. He will miss at least half of next season while rehabbing from a cartilage transplant, and he may never return from the injury.</p>
        <p>Martin assured the Nets that he is fine and will be ready for training camp. He recently had one of the screws removed from his ankle, and he squashed speculation that he would have to undergo another surgery before next season.</p>
        <p>Martin and Keith Van Horn give the Nets what is potentially one of the best forward tandems in the Eastern Conference.</p>
        <p>Marbury likes the frontcourt duo and looks at Van Horn, Martin and himself as a devastating threesome. ''We have a triangle now and that's what gets you championships,'' Marbury said.</p>
        <p>Martin said: ''I bring heart and determination. I'm a hard-nosed guy and I go out every day like it's my last game. That's what I'm going to do.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The Nets selected SOUMAILA SAMAKE, a 7-2, 230-pounder from Mali in West Africa, with their second-round pick, the 36th pick of the draft. The 22-year-old Samake played 60 games for the Cincinnati Stuff of the International Basketball League last season, averaging 9.7 points, 7.6 rebounds and a league-high 2.7 blocks.</p>
