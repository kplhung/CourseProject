        <p>Most weekdays, the competition for available taxis can seem like hand-to-hand combat. For people in wheelchairs, though, it is not just maddening, it is impossible: none of the city's 12,187 yellow cabs can pick them up.</p>
        <p>But today, the Taxi and Limousine Commission will begin a long and very likely contentious process, one under way in several other large cities, that officials hope will bring about a complete, and very costly, transformation of the taxi fleet over the next five years.</p>
        <p>If it works, the whole look of the New York yellow taxi would change -- cars and minivans would disappear, replaced mostly by tall sport-utility vehicles more at home in the mountains than in Midtown. And people in wheelchairs would be able to enter the same taxi-hailing fray as other New Yorkers, a change that many advocates for the disabled thought would never come.</p>
        <p>''The yellow taxi really is as recognizable a symbol of New York as the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building, and we think the time has come to make them available to everyone,'' said Terence J. Moakley, an associate executive director of the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association, which represents 2,200 disabled veterans in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>A movement to make taxis accessible has been around since at least 1990, the year the Americans With Disabilities Act was passed, forcing cities to make buses and other public transportation accessible but generally excluding private taxi and livery companies from those requirements.</p>
        <p>Though New York officials hoped that those companies might voluntarily add some accessible cabs, that did not happen. In fact, advocates say that in a city with up to 50,000 residents who use wheelchairs, there are no yellow taxi companies and only two livery companies -- one formed last year at the urging of city officials -- that can respond to calls from wheelchair passengers. Between them, the livery companies operate seven wheelchair-equipped vans, or about one for every 7,100 residents who might need them.</p>
        <p>In 1996, more than a dozen New York advocacy groups for the disabled, with the endorsement of a long list of elected officials, formed the Taxis for All Campaign, which began to pressure the Taxi and Limousine Commission to make changes. And last year, Diane McGrath-McKechnie, the commission's chairwoman, began to meet quietly with owners of yellow medallion fleets and livery car fleets, essentially asking them to start changing the industry themselves before she forced them to.</p>
        <p>The owners were given until May 1 of this year to come up with a plan that would provide, if not the ability of wheelchair users to hail cabs, at least a way for them to call a car and be served quickly and at the same price as other passengers.</p>
        <p>But because the owners did not come up with a plan that was aggressive enough by the deadline, Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said, the commission has proposed a rule requiring any new yellow cabs bought after next July 1 to be wheelchair accessible. Livery companies would either have to buy enough accessible cars to provide equivalent service to disabled passengers or have to enter into contracts with other companies to provide that service for them. The proposed rule will be debated at a public hearing today at the commission's lower Manhattan headquarters.</p>
        <p>As it stands, the only alternatives for wheelchair users are city buses, which are now all accessible, or a shared van service provided by New York City Transit called Access-a-Ride, for which trips must be arranged days in advance. (Because of demand, many wheelchair passengers say, it is impossible to arrange quick trips with the two private livery companies; their vans are sometimes booked a week in advance. In addition, they are more expensive than regular car services.)</p>
        <p>''You're left with a situation where disabled New Yorkers and others who visit here have this huge gap in service,'' said A. Gifford Miller, a city councilman from the Upper East Side who has pushed for accessible taxis. ''It's a big problem for everyday life. If you want to go, for example, to the doctor's office and it's not right around the corner from your house, you have to pay for ambulette service, which is extremely expensive. You can't call a car or go outside and get a taxi.''</p>
        <p>Yellow taxi fleet owners say that  the burden of accessibility would fall unfairly on them. In theory, livery companies could get by with converting only a small part of their fleets to respond quickly to demand from wheelchair users' calls. But for people in wheelchairs to have an equal chance of hailing a yellow taxi, most of the taxis, if not all, would have to be made accessible.</p>
        <p>Medallion industry officials add that vans big enough to accommodate wheelchairs cost thousands of dollars more than the minivans starting to appear in their fleets. And installing a wheelchair lift and making changes to the vans so that chairs can fit can cost more than $7,000 per cab.</p>
        <p>In a statement to be delivered at today's hearing, Ronald Sherman, president of the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, argues that even if those costly conversions were made, the system would still be impractical for both wheelchair users and cab drivers.</p>
        <p>''High demand coupled with a driver shortage has made competition for taxi service fierce, if not downright combative,'' Mr. Sherman wrote. ''For these reasons, it is unlikely that people with disabilities would be successful in hailing a yellow cab that is equipped to accommodate them.''</p>
        <p>He added that drivers, who generally lease cabs on a daily basis from the fleets, would also resist leasing accessible taxis because loading wheelchair passengers would take time and cut down on the number of fares they picked up on their shifts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moakley and other advocates say they understand the practical problems and will accept a longer period for the changes to be phased in. Mr. Miller, the city councilman, added that the city should also explore taxi industry rule changes and perhaps public subsidies that would give owners and drivers the incentive to make the change.</p>
        <p>But proponents of taxi accessibility quickly add that the demand exists for fleet owners to make money serving disabled passengers. A survey of 400 disabled city residents conducted last year found that 87 percent said they would take taxis and livery cars if they could, and 53 percent said they would probably use them at least once a week.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot people out there who want quick ways to get to the office, to restaurants, to the theater, to visit friends,'' Mr. Moakley said. ''I hate to use the cliche, but this really is one of those 'Field of Dreams' situations. If you build it, they will come.''</p>
