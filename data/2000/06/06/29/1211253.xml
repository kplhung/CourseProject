        <p>Speedy Claxton was always a step behind Erick Barkley as they made their way through the playgrounds. Barkley was the phenom and Claxton the steady partner. Last night, Claxton finally pushed his way in front as both headed to the National Basketball Association.</p>
        <p>After the two spent the last two weeks traveling the nation together, finding themselves banded together in workouts for various teams, Claxton made the first step into the N.B.A., going from Hofstra University to the Philadelphia 76ers with the 20th pick in the first round of the draft. While he began a celebration, Barkley waited. Projected as high as the back end of the lottery, Barkley sat through all the stops that had seemed destined for a point guard, even watching the Knicks pass by the chance for the second straight year to snag a St. John's star in the opening round. Finally, at No. 28, Barkley went to Portland.</p>

        <p>Speedy Claxton was always a step behind Erick Barkley as they made their way through the playgrounds. Barkley was the phenom and Claxton the steady partner. Last night, Claxton finally pushed his way in front as both headed to the National Basketball Association.</p>
        <p>After the two spent the last two weeks traveling the nation together, finding themselves banded together in workouts for various teams, Claxton made the first step into the N.B.A., going from Hofstra University to the Philadelphia 76ers with the 20th pick in the first round of the draft. While he began a celebration, Barkley waited. Projected as high as the back end of the lottery, Barkley sat through all the stops that had seemed destined for a point guard, even watching the Knicks pass by the chance for the second straight year to snag a St. John's star in the opening round. Finally, at No. 28, Barkley went to Portland.</p>
        <p>''It's always happened to me,'' said Claxton, who spent the evening with his coach, Jay Wright, and a large contingent of the Hofstra family, at Bogart's, a restaurant down the street from the school. ''People always underestimated me. I'm glad that I proved everybody wrong. But I still have a lot of work to do.''</p>
        <p>Claxton and Barkley once played in the same backcourt for Christ the King High School before heading off their separate ways. Claxton went unheralded to Hofstra University, where he lifted the program to an N.C.A.A. berth in his senior season. Barkley spent one season at a prep school before playing two years for St. John's, leading the Red Storm to the N.C.A.A. tournament's final eight two years ago and a second-round berth this season.</p>
        <p>Barkley's stay at St. John's was hounded by the specter of a National Collegiate Athletic Association investigation, an interrogation that spurred his decision to bypass his final two years of eligibility and declare for the draft. Claxton played his full four years at Hofstra, waiting his turn. And it was not until his senior year that he began to earn the acclaim that has come to him, perhaps not fully realizing just how much interest there was until he went to the predraft camps and played as well as any point guard.</p>
        <p>When Larry Brown's Sixers grabbed him at No. 20, it marked the first time a Hofstra player was taken in the first round since 1973, when Rich Laurel was taken at No. 19.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most surprising, the Sixers had not even brought him in for an interview or workout.</p>
        <p>''I was very surprised, but I'm looking forward to it,'' Claxton said. ''It's a great city. They just thought I was a good player. Coach Brown said to me, 'You've found a way to play wherever you're at. You will here, too.' He said I'll definitely play.''</p>
        <p>While they have taken differing paths to the N.B.A., Claxton and Barkley united by phone last night. Claxton waited to see where Barkley would land, then called him. ''I've dreamed of this for years, and for it to come true now is unbelievable,'' Claxton said. ''I'm just happy. That's the only way I can explain it. I'm happy that we both made it. I think we'll both do well in the league.''</p>
