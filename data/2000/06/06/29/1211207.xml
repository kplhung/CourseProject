        <p>TO: JOHN ROCKER  RE: IF YOU GO . . .</p>
        <p>FIRST things first. It is not the No. 7 line, not to New Yorkers, anyway, no more than Sixth Avenue is the Avenue of the Americas. It's the Flushing line, after Flushing -- location of the first and last stop in Queens (Main Street Flushing).</p>
        <p>Nor is it a tourist attraction, or mainly a train to Shea Stadium. The Flushing line is a typical subway workhorse that takes people to and from work, school, shopping and such. On an average business day, 400,000 people ride the Flushing line. In 24 hours, nearly 45,000 people go through the turnstiles at Main Street, heading for ''the city,'' of which Queens is a part, of course. But people from Queens have always called Manhattan the city and probably always will.</p>
        <p>Though you managed to give it some notoriety, the 72-year-old Flushing line, which runs mostly on elevated tracks, is pretty typical of New York City's buses and trains. It has plastic and steel seats, scratchiti on the windows, and an erratic air-conditioning system that is no match for the wafts of refrigerated air that caress visitors to Atlanta's Peachtree Center.</p>
        <p>But the view! And we do not refer to the sight of the Manhattan skyline from the first few stops in Queens, though that view is worthy of a postcard. No, we refer to less tangible views, glimpses into parts of New York far away from its towering skyscrapers and Midtown affluence.</p>
        <p>The Flushing line -- inside its cars and outside its windows -- takes you to the core of New York. In about a half-hour (a little longer for the local), the Flushing line takes riders 9.43 linear miles between Times Square and Main Street, Flushing. And light years in every other way. As the train heads east, the towers of Manhattan become a backdrop to the low-rise buildings of Sunnyside, Woodside, Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, Corona and Flushing -- a swath of Queens where people speak more than 100 languages and come from almost everywhere, no exaggeration.</p>
        <p>Census figures and studies by the City Planning Commission provide the statistics, from the number of countries represented in Elmhurst (110) to the number of legal immigrants who settled in downtown Flushing between 1990 and 1996 (nearly 20,000, mostly from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea).</p>
        <p>GLIMPSES of the streets below the elevated Flushing line illustrate the statistics if you know what you are seeing: the Banco Popular beneath the 82nd Street station in heavily Colombian Jackson Heights; the Korean characters in store windows just a few stops farther into Queens, and then, when you emerge from the station in Flushing, you forget about ''the city'' and feel as though you are in Hong Kong or Beijing.</p>
        <p>The faces and voices on the train tell the same story. Stories, that is. Consider Car 9696 of the local Flushing train that left Times Square at 12:50 yesterday afternoon. Car 9696 was the reality underlying your crude caricature.</p>
        <p>A sampling: two teenage girls with Beastie Boy backpacks, listening to their disc players. Two middle-age women talking animatedly in Spanish. A young man visiting from St. Martin looking for the E train (he changed at 74th Street). A sorry-looking man in filthy jeans begging for change. An equally sorry-looking woman lugging a tattered net shopping bag. An Asian woman with her son, a boy of about 7 in a parochial school uniform, so busy working on the computer in his lap that he never looked up.</p>
        <p>Young Kim, 38, was in that car, heading home to Jackson Heights from his restaurant job in Lower Manhattan. He came here from South Korea 12 years ago, he said, and takes the Flushing line every day.</p>
        <p>Dinesh Kumar, who emigrated from India four years ago, was on his way from his Sunnyside home to Queens College, about a 45-minute ride, counting the bus from Main Street. He is studying computer science.</p>
        <p>On the ride back, it was no different. A beefy man with a Playboy bunny tattoo on his left arm; two little boys reading ''Pocahontas'' together; Robert Smith, 23, commuting from Flushing to the Police Academy in Manhattan. Nobody with blue hair, coming or going.</p>
        <p>And oh, yes -- a tourist. From Atlanta. Brian Marzo, 17, riding on Car 9696 yesterday with his parents. ''Ignorant,'' he said of those nasty comments you made. ''I think it's a beautiful thing, diversity. Atlanta just doesn't get exposed to as much as New York does.''</p>
        <p>Look at it this way, Mr. Rocker: insights into 100 countries in about a half-hour. Then again, you'd probably prefer a bus. The chartered kind. With curtains.</p>
