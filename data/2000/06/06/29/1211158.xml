        <p>A toughened Chesapeake Bay restoration agreement intended to achieve a tenfold increase in oyster production and a 30 percent drop in watershed land lost to suburban sprawl was signed today by state and federal officials who hailed it as an environmental model for the nation.</p>
        <p>''There is nothing else like it,'' said Carol M. Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in praising the pact's inclusion of the anti-sprawl pledge by the governors of Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania. ''This is the first-ever federal-state-local agreement to have that commitment.''</p>
        <p>The revision of the 18-year-old multigovernment agreement was announced in a ceremony here on the bay's western shore. Speakers celebrated the slow mending of the bay's tattered ecology and the innovative standards and timetables set for further cleansing the vast bay resource, which covers 64,000 square miles and serves 15 million people.</p>
        <p>The agreement's most controversial and ambitious goal is the anti-sprawl commitment, which would mean a 30 percent reduction in the projected loss of the bay's farm and forest land to development by 2012. This would spare an estimated 30,000 acres a year if the state governments live up to that commitment across the next decade.</p>
        <p>''It's the first quantitative target of its sort that one of the nation's regional water body cleanups has adopted,'' said Michael Hirshfield, vice president for resource protection at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a watchdog group of scientists and volunteers.</p>
        <p>''Sprawl has been discussed for years and enough people felt this new agreement had to take it on, so it does,'' Mr. Hirshfield said in an interview while praising the separate commitment to preserve 20 percent of watershed land from development permanently by the year 2010.</p>
        <p>While the agreement sets voluntary goals, over the years state and local governments, prodded by environmental groups, have slowly enacted laws to meet many of the escalating goals of the pact. These have produced such recent successes as the resurgence of rockfish and the flourishing of pelicans and other birds. But progress is offset by the effects of pollution runoff from farms and suburbs and wetland loss through over-development.</p>
        <p>The agreement also includes a pledge to protect and revive the devastated blue crab population, with the first cautious harvest goals to be set across the next year. More promising is the commitment to a tenfold increase in oysters, one of the crucial food-chain creatures needed for filtering impurities from the bay.</p>
        <p>If met as promised by 2010, this would mean a restoration to about 15 percent of the output of the bay's oyster heyday a century ago when 20 million bushels were harvested annually and the bay was one of the world's premier seafood resources. Development and pollution devastated the bay and reduced the take to less than 500,000 bushels. But scientists have developed a promising technique of recreating the high-rise oyster reefs of a century ago.</p>
        <p>With the bay shimmering in the background, Gov. Parris N. Glendening of Maryland recalled ''the darkest of times'' two decades ago when the bay's vitality was sapped and the first uncertain agreement was pledged. Mr. Glendening noted the firmer political commitments that grew to support the pact. This year, his state earmarked $25 million for the oyster program, and Virginia declared a vast swath of the bay off-limits to commercial crabbing so female crabs would be protected and the population might rebound.</p>
        <p>Federal and state agencies spend about $150 million a year on programs devoted to reducing nutrient and toxic pollution, restoring vastly eroded underwater grasses and reviving waterway passages for migratory fish, a prime barometer of a healthy bay. Progress against nutrient pollution has included a drop of 6 million pounds annually in phosphorus and 42 million pounds in nitrogen, but has come with a warning that expected population growth will intensify the problem.</p>
        <p>For all the optimism of the Chesapeake Executive Council, which includes the District of Columbia as well as the three states, members noted that the overall goal of seeing the bay removed from the environmental agency's list of ''impaired waters'' remained unmet. Among other problems, the bay, including its tidal rivers, does not meet standards for dissolved oxygen.</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists expressed disappointment that the agreement did not ban the dumping of dredge spoil in the bay nor address problems like nitrogen pollution from cars and power plants.</p>
        <p>''But over all,'' Mr. Hirshfield said, ''compared to other areas of the country I'm familiar with, in terms of specific actions this stacks up very well.''</p>
