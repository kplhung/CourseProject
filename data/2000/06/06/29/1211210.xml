        <p>When Ra miro Mendoza last pitched  Saturday in Chicago -- he left the game with a big lead and a bad feeling. The lingering twinge behind his right shoulder troubled him and he told reporters he was scared about his health.</p>
        <p>Despite a rebuke from Manager Joe Torre, who said reporters had overblown Mendoza's words, the pitcher proved correct. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list today, retroactive to Sunday, with what the Yankees described as weakness in the posterior of his shoulder. Torre said the decision to rest Mendoza actually came Tuesday, when the pitcher was supposed to play catch in the outfield.</p>
        <p>Torre said Mendoza was not comfortable and the team shut him down. Torre said he had forgotten to announce the move because of the circumstances of Tuesday's game, an extra-inning loss that featured the ejections of the manager and his bench coach, Don Zimmer.</p>
        <p>Since the Yankees currently have a rotation as banged up as a junk-yard jalopy, they are in the market for pitching help and did not want to let other teams know just how dire things were until the last possible moment.</p>
        <p>Torre was pragmatic in the face of yet another hurdle in what has evolved into a disconcerting first half of the season. ''We've had a pretty good run for four years,'' he said. ''I'm not about to throw in the towel. The luck portion of baseball comes when you stay healthy. If we can just continue to stay close, that's all we need to do, hopefully. Right now, our one mindset has to be to get to 10 games over.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees did not call anyone up to join the 25-man roster tonight and their starters for Friday and Saturday, in an already patchwork rotation, remained unclear. But after Torre had to go to the bullpen in the third inning to replace starter Ben Ford tonight, it is almost certain the Yankees will have to call up a pitcher to shore up a weary staff. Mendoza, who missed a start early in June with the same injury, said tonight that he did not expect to need more tests.</p>
