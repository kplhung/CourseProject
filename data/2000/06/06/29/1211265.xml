        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was relieved to read Candy Schulman's letter (Incoming, ''Conspicuous Consumption'') in response to your article about televisions and VCR's in cars (''Where the TV Meets the Road,'' June 15). It's always surprising to me how many articles focus on technology hype and forget to report other viewpoints. The article reminded me of my latest favorite commercial to hate: the dad is in the hotel room cheering for his son's soccer game, watching it live on his computer, ''proving'' once again that humans can have meaningful relationships without actually showing up. Perhaps it's pushing concepts like these that is the real reason you hear about millionaires in Silicon Valley having problems finding a date.</p>
