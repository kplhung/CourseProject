        <p>Hoping to raise public awareness of an international election to help administer the Internet, public interest groups announced yesterday a voter registration and education campaign to recruit what it called cybercitizens.</p>
        <p>The campaign urges Internet users to join the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which was selected in 1998 to take over administration of the network's addressing, or domain name system.</p>
        <p>The nonprofit group, known as Icann, is holding its first global elections this fall. Anyone age 16 or older with an e-mail address is eligible to join the group. Those who register on Icann's at-large membership Web site, http://members.icann.org/ by July 31 will be able to vote in the first election.</p>
        <p>The public-awareness effort was announced by the Center for Democracy and Technology, Common Cause and the American Library Association, three groups that have been working with Icann to try to ensure that individual Internet users are properly represented on Icann's board.</p>
        <p>While representatives of business and of technical groups have already elected nine board members, Icann will hold elections this fall for the first five of what ultimately will be nine at-large members, who will represent Internet users in general.</p>
        <p>Although Icann defines itself as a standards-setting body with a role limited to the technical functions of the Internet, it has already made rules to protect trademark interests from so-called cybersquatters, or speculators in domain names. And in its next meeting, scheduled to begin July 13 in Japan, the group is expected to begin moving on plans to add new top-level domains to supplement the popular .com, .net and .org suffixes.</p>
        <p>Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, said the goal of the campaign was to educate Internet users about Icann and how the group's decisions could affect them.</p>
        <p>''They are essentially effecting what is going to be a critical identity and property right of every person in the 21st century, said Mr. Berman.''</p>
        <p>The center, Common Cause and the library group said they would be alerting their members about the campaign. Mr. Berman said that any company or group wanting to post information on the campaign is welcome to copy the information on the ''Become a CyberCitizen'' page on the center's Web site, www.cdt.org.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the library group said it would be urging librarians around the country to post the campaign information on the first page that Internet users see when using public computers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roberts said that about 20,000 people have already registered and that updated numbers with country-specific information should be posted on the Icann Web site this week</p>
