        <p>A commission appointed by the mayor to monitor the Police Department's anti-corruption efforts has found that the internal system for disciplining officers is staffed with inexperienced lawyers and mired in delays, according to a draft report.</p>
        <p>The highly critical report, by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Commission to Combat Police Corruption, does not conclude whether officers are treated too leniently or too harshly by the system, which handles accusations of misconduct, like failing to wear the proper hat or making a false statement, that do not rise to the level of criminal charges. But it does say the system is so slow and ineffective that officers have little confidence in it.</p>
        <p>The criticism comes as the department faces the possibility of a federal civil rights lawsuit over its handling of accusations of excessive force, and it could contribute to the perception that the police are unable to discipline their own. After a three-year inquiry, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are negotiating with the city for the appointment of a federal monitor to oversee the department because of its poor performance in investigating brutality cases. The prosecutors have said they will sue if the city does not agree to a monitor.</p>
        <p>Draft copies of the report were sent to the Police Department and officials at City Hall for review, and a copy was given to The New York Times. In a sharp blow to the department, the draft report recommends that some internal disciplinary cases be prosecuted by the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the outside agency that investigates complaints of police abuse filed by civilians. Department lawyers now prosecute those cases before an administrative law judge. And while the draft stresses that the police commissioner should still have the final word on discipline, it also urges that the city explore setting up a new, separate agency to pursue administrative misconduct cases for all agencies.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani did not return calls about the draft report last night. Police Commissioner Howard Safir declined to comment on it, saying through a spokesman that the department would discuss the final report when it was released. But a senior police official said that while the department did not agree with the overall thrust of the report, ''there were several good points'' and ''we're looking at them to see if changes should be implemented.''</p>
        <p>The mayor created the commission in 1995 after he successfully blocked a City Council attempt to create an independent agency with wide-ranging authority to investigate police corruption. Some critics on the Council have criticized it as ineffectual.</p>
        <p>The commission's eight-month study examined the department's internal disciplinary system, known among police officers as the trial room.</p>
        <p>It reviewed the summaries of 750 cases against officers that were closed from November 1998 to October 1999, and closely examined the files of 49 cases closed in the spring of 1999.</p>
        <p>The commission found that the trial room's prosecutors were inexperienced and poorly supervised. The report said that inadequate trial preparation, a frequent failure to make timely contact with witnesses and poor presentations at hearings led to case dismissals and damaged the effectiveness of the prosecutions.</p>
        <p>The most serious problem, the report said, was the lengthy delays, which in some instances lasted up to two years before an officer's case reached an administrative hearing. The delays, the draft says, have ''serious negative consequences for the department's disciplinary system, including impact on the viability of prosecutions, deterrence, fairness to members of the service who are ultimately exonerated, and the public's perception that the department is willing, and capable, of effectively disciplining its own members.''</p>
        <p>The commission also found that the department did not routinely gather data on how long disciplinary cases took. The delays not only adversely affect the quality of the cases, with the memories of witnesses fading over time, but also place the careers of defendant police officers on hold. Advancement within the department is generally barred for officers with an open disciplinary case.</p>
        <p>The internal disciplinary system consists of one office that tries the cases against the officers and another that oversees the department's administrative law judges. In the administrative hearings, the standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt, as in criminal trials, making it easier for the department to prove its case.</p>
        <p>A little more than half of the cases are based on allegations of misconduct uncovered by the department's Internal Affairs Bureau and its inspections units, which handle less serious cases.</p>
        <p>The allegations of wrongdoing range from work rule violations like the failure to properly fill out paperwork to the failure to take police action.</p>
        <p>The balance of the cases are based on civilian complaints of police abuse and are also prosecuted by the department in the trial room.</p>
        <p>The police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which has long complained about what it says is the unfair treatment of officers in the trial room, has in recent months stepped up its criticism, arguing that the department is seeking heavier penalties to stave off the federal lawsuit.</p>
        <p>''It's good that finally light is being shined on this issue,'' said Patrick J. Lynch, the union president. ''It's out of control, it's inefficient and it's being run by people who are inept. And right now, this is seriously affecting morale of the police officers. We need to have an independent hearing officer, truly independent.''</p>
        <p>A senior City Hall official who was familiar with the report praised the commission. ''They found an area that's a terrible weak spot,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>Richard J. Davis, the chairman of the commission, would not comment on the findings, but he released a statement saying he would discuss the report after its formal release, which he said would occur shortly.</p>
        <p>''The commission continues to believe that the Police Department is committed to having an effective disciplinary system and will continue to work with the department to help achieve this goal,'' Mr. Davis's statement said.</p>
        <p>While the commission's review was under way, the department undertook several of its recommendations, including adding law clerks for the administrative law judges. And the department has halted trials for two weeks, partly in an effort to clear the backlog through plea deals.</p>
        <p>''We believe the system is working well, but that doesn't mean it can't be improved,'' the senior Police Department official said. ''Hopefully the report will make the system better.''</p>
