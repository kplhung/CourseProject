        <p>If their names were not Jeter, O'Neill, Williams, Cone, they would be no more credible than the Florida Marlins or the Minnesota Twins. If not for their gaudy World Series rings, they would be written off as possible contenders.</p>
        <p>If not for the pedigree, this is what would be said about the Yankees: Their pitching is terrible. They can't catch the ball. Their offense is sterile.</p>
        <p>They stink.</p>
        <p>They have the big names, however, and the rings and the pedigree, and even after games like tonight's, when Detroit crushed four homers among eight extra-base hits and destroyed the Yankees, 13-6, it seems as if it's only a matter of time before the Yankees rebound and at least play adequately.</p>
        <p>But with each successive defeat, they are moving closer to being defined by a slump that has now encompassed one-fourth of the season's schedule.</p>
        <p>Ben Ford made his fourth start as a professional tonight, and with the Yankees needing a solid start, he lasted only two batters into the third inning; before the end of the third, the Tigers led, 11-1. The Yankees have dropped 26 of their last 41 games, and are three games out of first place in the American League East, behind the Toronto Blue Jays.</p>
        <p>As the rout played out, Coach Don Zimmer turned to Manager Joe Torre on the bench and said, ''This has happened to you before.''</p>
        <p>In referring to a manager of a struggling team that appears allergic to success, Zimmer was looking at the big picture. ''Yeah,'' Torre said, recalling his stints as manager of the Mets, Braves and Cardinals. Torre then turned to Derek Jeter, who just turned 26 years old and has collected three championship rings and has not played a full season on a losing team since his days at Kalamazoo Central High School. ''This has never happened to you,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, and I'm already tired of it,'' Jeter said.</p>
        <p>The Yankees could do nothing but wallow in their fate tonight. Before the game, Ramiro Mendoza was placed on the disabled list, already inhabited by Roger Clemens. Andy Pettitte was told he will pitch Thursday on just three days' rest. And the Yankees made plans to start Orlando Hernandez on Saturday, if his elbow is all right. Oddly, a healthy David Cone is the one pitcher unaffected by all the uncertainty, and he has not won since April 28.</p>
        <p>So there was real pressure on Ford when he took the mound tonight. ''There may have been a little too much pressure,'' Torre mused later.</p>
        <p>Ford could not keep his fastball down and the Tigers got two runs in the first inning and three in the second. Tony Clark crushed a homer leading off the third, Ford walked the next hitter and he was replaced, trailing, 6-0. Allen Watson replaced him and surrendered three homers in the span of 11 hitters, leaving Zimmer, Torre and Jeter to compare the most miserable days of their baseball lives.</p>
        <p>''You have to be in that dugout to appreciate how much they're hurting,'' Torre said of his players. They go back to the dugout after giving up runs in bunches, he said, and players start yelling to pump each other up, as they always have. ''And sometimes they hear their own echoes,'' the manager added.</p>
        <p>''We've never struggled like this,'' Pettitte said. ''It's easy to win. It's easy when you're on top. We've got to forget about complaining and forget about feeling sorry for ourselves -- I don't think anybody is at all. I mean, teams are loving this. We've been beating up on teams for three or four years and they see us down, and they are going to try to bury us.</p>
        <p>''We've got to remember that. We're not even halfway through the season, and we've got to keep playing hard. We realize we've got a lot of guys banged up, we've got a lot of things going on, and I think everybody is just waiting for it to turn around.''</p>
        <p>Pettitte paused, heard his own echoes, absorbed his own words. ''The thing is, you hate to just keep saying, 'It'll turn around.' ''</p>
        <p>Pettitte will pitch Thursday night trying to reverse the slide. The Yankees have lost six of their last seven games on this trip; they have dropped all five games in Detroit's new Comerica Park this year.</p>
        <p>In the last 41 games, Yankee pitchers have allowed 390 hits and 166 walks in 358 2/3 innings -- a staggering 1.55 baserunners per inning -- and accumulated a 5.24 earned run average. The Yankees rank among baseball's worst fielding teams, with Chuck Knoblauch first in errors (15) among second basemen, Jeter fifth (with 10 errors) at shortstop, the third baseman Scott Brosius eighth (with 6).</p>
        <p>''It's a new experience,'' Jeter said, ''and I'm sick of it.''</p>
        <p>Andy Stankiewicz was the Yankees' shortstop eight years ago. Kevin Maas was the designated hitter, Mel Hall and Danny Tartabull were outfielders, and Melido Perez was the ace. They were all part of the last Yankee team to finish under .500, winning 76 and losing 86 in 1992.</p>
        <p>The 2000 Yankees are still two games over .500, but they are sinking fast, dragging down their names, their rings and their pedigrees with them.</p>
