        <p>The Supreme Court ruled today by a 5-to-4 vote that the Boy Scouts have a constitutional right to exclude gay members because opposition to homosexuality is part of the organization's ''expressive message.''</p>

        <p>The Supreme Court ruled today by a 5-to-4 vote that the Boy Scouts have a constitutional right to exclude gay members because opposition to homosexuality is part of the organization's ''expressive message.''</p>
        <p>The decision overturned a ruling last year by the New Jersey Supreme Court that applied the state's law against discrimination in public accommodations to require a New Jersey troop to readmit a longtime member and assistant scoutmaster, James Dale, whom it had dismissed after learning he was gay.</p>
        <p>Writing for the court today, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said that the court intended neither to approve nor disapprove the Boy Scouts' view of homosexuality, but that the First Amendment's protection for freedom of association meant that the state could not compel the 6.2-million member organization ''to accept members where such acceptance would derogate from the organization's expressive message.''</p>
        <p>He said ''Dale's presence in the Boy Scouts would, at the very least, force the organization to send a message, both to the youth members and the world, that the Boy Scouts accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.'' [Excerpts, Page A28.]</p>
        <p>The four dissenters did not object to the general principle that an organization cannot be forced to adopt or incorporate an unwanted message -- a principle the court applied unanimously five years ago in upholding the right of the Boston St. Patrick's Day parade organizers to exclude a group that sought to march under a banner of Irish gay pride.</p>
        <p>But the dissenters objected strenuously to that principle's application in this case, because they said the majority had done little more than accept at face value the Boy Scouts' assertion of the central importance of their opposition to homosexuality. But except in briefs filed in cases defending their membership policy, the Boy Scouts had never made the ''clear, unequivocal statement necessary to prevail'' on a claim that homosexuality was fundamentally incompatible with the organization's mission, the dissenters said.</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Justice John Paul Stevens filed the main dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and David H. Souter, who also filed a dissenting opinion.</p>
        <p>In permitting the Boy Scouts' First Amendment interests to trump New Jersey's antidiscrimination law, the majority relied heavily on its 1995 St. Patrick's Day parade case, in which the gay marchers had claimed the protection of a Massachusetts civil rights law. That decision and the ruling today indicated that the court would continue to weigh on a case-by-case basis the competing claims of a private group's right to exclude unwanted participation and a public policy against discrimination.</p>
        <p>The majority today drew a distinction between this decision and a trio of Supreme Court rulings from the 1980's rejecting the arguments of all-male organizations, including the Rotary Club, that they had a First Amendment right to exclude women.</p>
        <p>The court held in those cases that because the exclusion of women was not part of the shared goal or expressive message of those organizations, the application of state civil rights laws to require the admission of women did not place an unconstitutional burden on the members' right of association.</p>
        <p>While none of the court's free association cases have dealt with exclusion by private organizations on the basis of race, that analysis would presumably permit a white supremacy group to exclude blacks if racial exclusion was an inherent part of the group's identity and message.</p>
        <p>In his opinion, Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, No. 99-699, the chief justice quoted from various Boy Scouts publications and explanations of the policy, noting that though the terms ''morally straight'' and ''clean'' in the Scout Oath and Law ''are by no means self-defining,'' Scout officials interpreted them as statements of opposition to homosexuality.</p>
        <p>Ruth Harlow, deputy legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund in New York, said today that the Boy Scouts had won only a ''hollow, Pyrrhic victory'' because to win the case, it had to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction the centrality of its opposition to homosexuality. ''The Boy Scouts have fought long and hard for something that has marginalized their institution,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Evan Wolfson, another lawyer with the Lambda organization, who represented Mr. Dale before the court, said the decision ''requires you to declare yourself an institution with an anti-gay message, and we don't think there are many organizations in this day and age willing to declare themselves as that.''</p>
        <p>In his dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens noted several newspaper articles from the last few weeks that described a gay pride day at the Central Intelligence Agency, a New England boarding school's acceptance of openly gay couples as dormitory parents and the extension of benefits to gay partners by the major automobile makers. ''The past month alone has witnessed some remarkable changes in attitudes about homosexuals,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Rehnquist responded: ''Indeed, it appears that homosexuality has gained greater societal acceptance. But this is scarcely an argument for denying First Amendment protection to those who refuse to accept these views.''</p>
        <p>In a statement on its Web site, the Boy Scouts said that as a private organization, the Scouts ''must have the right to establish its own standards of membership if it is to continue to instill the values of the Scout oath and law in boys.'' The statement continued: ''Thanks to our legal victories, our standards of membership have been sustained. We believe an avowed homosexual is not a role model for the values espoused in the Scout oath and law.''</p>
        <p>Drawing on the distinctions between this case and the earlier rulings on all-male clubs, the chief justice said that, to claim the First Amendment's protection, ''a group must engage in some form of expression, whether it be public or private.''</p>
        <p>Justice Stevens said in dissent that the majority's distinction was unpersuasive because just as the all-male clubs had not made the exclusion of women a central goal, ''there is no shared goal or collective effort to foster a belief about homosexuality'' in the Boy Scouts, ''let alone one that is significantly burdened by admitting homosexuals.''</p>
        <p>Justice Stevens said: ''The only apparent explanation for the majority's holding, then, is that homosexuals are simply so different from the rest of society that their presence alone -- unlike any other individual's -- should be singled out for special First Amendment treatment.''</p>
        <p>The civic and cultural standing of the Boy Scouts, the ''sincerity'' of which the majority opinion noted in several places, may have had more to do with the outcome of the case than Mr. Dale's sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>The case attracted dozens of briefs, a number depicting this legal battle -- which the Boy Scouts have been waging in courts around the country for 20 years -- as the cutting edge of the current culture wars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dale was an Eagle Scout and popular member and then assistant leader of the troop he had joined at the age of 8 when, 12 years later, he was ejected after his picture appeared in a New Jersey newspaper article about a gay student conference at Rutgers, where he was co-president of the gay and lesbian students' organization. He brought suit under a New Jersey law that prohibits discrimination in places of public accommodation.</p>
        <p>Because the New Jersey Supreme Court found as a matter of state law that the Boy Scouts fit the definition of a public accommodation, rather than a purely private organization, that aspect of the case was not open to the justices' re-examination.</p>
        <p>THE SUPREME COURT: THE NEW JERSEY CASE  Correction:  July 1, 2000, Saturday  An article on Thursday about groups that disagreed with the Supreme Court ruling allowing the Boy Scouts of America to exclude gays misstated the position of the United Methodist Church. Although the church opposes discrimination based on sexual orientation, it did not encourage congregations to sever ties with the Boy Scouts.</p>
