        <p>Congress moved decisively today toward enacting the first major change in the nation's campaign finance law since 1979, closing a loophole through which millions of dollars have secretly flowed. President Clinton strongly supports the bill.</p>
        <p>Early this morning, the House overwhelmingly approved bipartisan legislation to require a growing number of shadowy tax-exempt groups that raise and spend money on political advocacy to disclose their activities and donors. The vote was 385 to 39.</p>
        <p>Senate Republican leaders who had fought the measure conceded today that the Senate would approve the House bill. After a brief debate tonight, a final vote was scheduled for Thursday. The outcome is not in doubt. Three weeks ago, the Senate passed virtually the same measure, 57 to 42. ''This will pass overwhelmingly,'' said one senior Senate Republican aide.</p>
        <p>The startling events of the past 24 hours were a major victory for Senator John McCain, who made overhauling campaign finance law a centerpiece of his failed presidential bid this year, and his bipartisan allies in Congress.</p>
        <p>But their bill to constrain the undisclosed political activities of nonprofit groups is far less comprehensive than the legislation to overhaul the election laws that Mr. McCain has tried to push through the Senate.</p>
        <p>Today's vote represented a stern rebuke to House and Senate Republican leaders who tried to kill the measure by offering a much broader bill only to see that plan backfire. By clamping down only on the tax-exempt groups, the leaders hope to dilute support for more extensive measures.</p>
        <p>''This is truly a remarkable first step, but I don't think anyone is expecting a major bill beyond it this year,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. ''There will be calls for stronger reform, but not until 2001, after the excesses we're sure to see this year.''</p>
        <p>Representatives Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, told reporters that they would continue their fight for broader campaign finance legislation to restrict issue advertisements and ban unregulated donations called soft money. ''We're not going to let this go,'' Mr. Meehan said.</p>
        <p>At issue are scores of tax-exempt groups formed under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code. These groups raise money for polling, advertising and other political activities, but do not have to disclose contributors, as long as they do not back candidates.</p>
        <p>The committees span the political spectrum. One group, Republicans for Clean Air, ran $2.5 million in advertisements attacking Mr. McCain and praising Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the Republican primaries. Liberal groups, like the Sierra Club, also have 527 committees.</p>
        <p>The legislation passed by the House and before the Senate would require the 527 political groups with annual gross receipts of more than $25,000 to follow federal campaign law and file tax returns. They would have to disclose contributors who gave more than $200, and report expenditures of more than $500. A violator would face a 35 percent tax on all contributions and expenditures.</p>
        <p>The groups would have to report their donors and spending to the I.R.S. every three months in an election year. The information would be posted on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Since the Senate endorsed the measure sponsored by Mr. McCain and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, Senate and House Republicans have tried to dilute its impact by offering a competing bill expanding disclosure requirements to labor unions, business groups and trade associations.</p>
        <p>But critics complained that this approach was overly punitive toward the unions, while letting corporations off the hook. In recent days, traditional Republicans allies like the Christian Coalition and National Right to Life Committee balked at the disclosure requirements, and House Republican leaders relented.</p>
        <p>Eager to be perceived as backing up their support for disclosure, all senior House Republicans except the House majority whip, Tom DeLay of Texas, who is closely allied with a 527 organization, joined this morning's lopsided vote in favor.</p>
        <p>After that show of strength, top Senate Republicans were in no mood today to block the popular measure.  ''Senator Lott is not putting his body on those railroad tracks,'' said John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for the two presumptive presidential nominees, Gov.  George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore, applauded the House vote and urged Senate passage.</p>
        <p>Even as Congress moved to close one area of campaign abuses, lawyers and other campaign finance experts predicted that the 527 committees would receive a flood of donations before the law took effect. They also said it was likely that many groups would try to change to another nonprofit status to avoid the disclosure requirements.</p>
