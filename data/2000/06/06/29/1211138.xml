        <p>The summer movie season had started off so promisingly. ''Mission: Impossible 2'' racked up $91.8 million in American theaters on the long Memorial Day weekend, fueling a record-breaking $171 million holiday and causing swoons of ecstasy to ripple through the corporate corridors of major movie studios. After that, who knew what the rest of the summer of 2000 might bring? Perhaps there would be yet another bumper crop of $100 million movies, just like last summer.

        <p>The summer movie season had started off so promisingly. ''Mission: Impossible 2'' racked up $91.8 million in American theaters on the long Memorial Day weekend, fueling a record-breaking $171 million holiday and causing swoons of ecstasy to ripple through the corporate corridors of major movie studios. After that, who knew what the rest of the summer of 2000 might bring? Perhaps there would be yet another bumper crop of $100 million movies, just like last summer. Some even predicted that the hot months would see not just one, but two or even three $200 million blockbusters.</p>
        <p>And then something happened.</p>
        <p>The horizon darkened. The engine began to make a funny pinging sound. Slowly, silently, the air went out of the tires. And the summer movie season of 2000 began to sink into the doldrums -- at least compared with last year's.</p>
        <p>There were very few outright financial disasters among the films released in the five weeks after Memorial Day, the biggest bomb being the animated ''Titan A.E.,'' which cost more than $85 million and is expected to bring in somewhere around a third of that, causing 20th Century Fox this week to close the Phoenix animation studio that created it. But even the movies that were opening well (''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' ''Shaft,'' ''Me, Myself and Irene'') didn't seem to be clicking with audiences with quite the intensity that movies had exhibited in the summer of 1999.</p>
        <p>Take it weekend by weekend:</p>
        <p>On Memorial Day, strong holdover business from the hits of May (''Gladiator'' and ''Dinosaur''), mixed with an explosive opening for Paramount's ''Mission: Impossible 2'' and very promising debuts for Disney's ''Shanghai Noon'' and DreamWorks' ''Road Trip,'' created a 29 percent increase from 1999's holiday box office, when ''Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace'' was early in its lucrative run. The next weekend, June 2 to 4, when only one major Hollywood film opened, the Martin Lawrence comedy ''Big Momma's House,'' there was again an increase, 23 percent, from the 1999 figure for the same weekend.</p>
        <p>But each of the next three weekends saw dramatically lower receipts than the parallel weekends of 1999. On the second weekend of June 1999, ''Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' earned $54.9 million. This year on that weekend, the Nicolas Cage action film ''Gone in 60 Seconds'' led the field with $25.3 million. On the third weekend of June last year, Disney's animated ''Tarzan'' was the leader with $34.2 million. This year it was ''Shaft,'' with $21.7 million. And last year on the fourth weekend in June, Adam Sandler's ''Big Daddy'' was in first place with $41.5 million. This year it was Jim Carrey in ''Me, Myself and Irene'' at $24.2 million.</p>
        <p>There's nothing wrong with the grosses for most of these films -- ''Shaft,'' for instance, showed much more strength on opening weekend than most had expected and has been holding up very well -- but as a group they are just not generating as much box-office heat as last year's crop.</p>
        <p>In each case, the total weekend grosses for the top 12 films paled in comparison with those of 1999 -- down 19 percent in the second weekend in June, 21 percent in the third and 23 percent in the fourth.</p>
        <p>And that's only part of the story, because the holdover business -- the amount of money that movies make in their second, third and subsequent weekends -- was also, in many cases, weaker than last summer's, when even a movie like ''The General's Daughter,'' a Paramount film that never rose to first place at the box office, could go on to make more than $100 million.</p>
        <p>''I think it's the quality of the pictures,'' said Marvin Antonowsky, a former studio marketing executive now working as a freelance marketing consultant. ''There's only one film that's going to do $200 million this summer, and that's 'Mission: Impossible 2.' You've got the Jim Carrey movie doing something like half of what the Adam Sandler comedy did in the same weekend last year. Category by category, from big action pictures to broad comedies, the films are just not as strong. Last summer we had two successful romantic comedies with Julia Roberts. This summer I don't see any big picture for the female audience, no romantic comedies at all. It's a very weak summer.''</p>
        <p>Certainly the summer of 1999 was something of an anomaly, bracketed by the eagerly anticipated return of George Lucas's ''Star Wars'' series and the unexpected successes of ''The Sixth Sense'' and ''The Blair Witch Project'' in the season's second half. But in between, the summer also produced one $100 million success after another.</p>
        <p>''I've been cautious in saying that this could be a record summer because last year was just so amazing,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, a Los Angeles company that monitors box-office performance. ''The bottom line is that last year there were films that people really wanted to see that were marketed brilliantly and followed on the momentum of 'Phantom Menace.' The whole situation just pushed up everything and revved up audiences. And the strength of the holdover last year told us that the word-of-mouth was very, very strong. Ultimately, it comes down to the product.''</p>
        <p>Dan Fellman, president of distribution at Warner Brothers, attributed some of the lackluster box office to the scarcity of PG-13 movies. Too many movies are R-rated, he said, and that's bad for the summer, when studios are trying to draw more young people into theaters.</p>
        <p>''I think we're in a cyclical business, and you never really know where your hits are coming from,'' he said. ''You have to take the broader picture. Look at the year to date. It's already up 4 percent over last year for the whole year. If the summer comes up a little bit flat, I think the prognosis for the fall and holiday period looks absolutely terrific. I think we may end up the year on a high note, beating last year's record.''</p>
        <p>Some object to comparing this year with last, saying that 1999 was not part of a continuing upward trend but highly unusual.</p>
        <p>''Last year was abnormally high,'' said Jim Tharp, head of distribution at DreamWorks. ''I think if you look at an average of three years or so, this summer probably won't be down quite so much.''</p>
        <p>Others point to what they say is a strong lineup of films opening in the second half of the season as evidence that it is not too late for the summer to turn around. Those films include ''The Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps'' with Eddie Murphy, Robert Zemeckis's ''What Lies Beneath'' with Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer, ''The Hollow Man'' with Kevin Bacon, Bryan Singer's ''X-Men,'' the slasher-spoof ''Scary Movie'' and Disney's ''The Kid'' with Bruce Willis.</p>
        <p>But the turnaround had better begin quickly. Many think that if the season has any chance of shaking off the doldrums, it is with this weekend's new batch of films for the Independence Day holiday.</p>
        <p>''Certainly I think this is a key weekend if we are ever going to close the gap this summer,'' said Jeff Blake, head of distribution at Columbia Pictures. Columbia's own picture, ''The Patriot,'' starring Mel Gibson, opened on Wednesday. On Friday Mr. Gibson will be joined by George Clooney in ''The Perfect Storm'' and Robert De Niro battling animated characters in ''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.''</p>
        <p>''What should help us,'' said Mr. Dergarabedian, ''is that this year, with the holiday falling on a Tuesday, you have what amounts to a five-day holiday weekend.'' Although you have two of the films going after the same kind of audience, the action audience, there is enough time in a long weekend for people to see more than one film, and I believe they will. Then you have what could be effective counter-programming with the third film, 'Rocky and Bullwinkle,' which is aimed at a family audience.''</p>
        <p>DreamWorks also intends to capitalize on the generally glowing reviews that greeted the release of its animated ''Chicken Run'' last week by expanding into several hundred more theaters. ''That was always the plan, to build on word-of-mouth and be in a strong position for the long holiday weekend,'' Mr. Tharp said.</p>
        <p>Another factor working in this weekend's favor, as least as far as a year-by-year comparison goes, is that last year's holiday movie menu was not particularly strong. The top-grossing film was Barry Sonnenfeld's ''Wild, Wild West,'' which earned $36.4 million over the four-day weekend, followed by ''South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut'' with $14.7 million. Given a full five-day holiday weekend and the paucity of the competition remaining at the box office, this year's holiday films have at least a shot at attracting more people.</p>
        <p>Robert G. Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture group, said it was dangerous to take too narrow a look at the box office because of the differences between specific weekends, or even specific months, from one year to the next.</p>
        <p>''If you're comparing things to last year, it's a pretty dramatic difference because it was an extraordinary year,'' he said. Then, sounding a cautiously optimistic note, he added: ''That being said, I think that, clearly, May of this year was probably as big as or bigger than any May in history, and June is probably not going to be as big. But if you're looking ahead to the Fourth of July weekend, you have some really big movies opening, and my hope is that it will drive the rest of the business. People like to go to the movies, and they go more often when they see movies they enjoy.''</p>
