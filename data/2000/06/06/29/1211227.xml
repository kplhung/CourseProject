        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton defended her two-week-long wave of attacks on Representative Rick A.

        <p>''I don't think the congressman has anything to fear from me; I think the only thing he has to fear is his own record,'' Mrs. Clinton said, emerging from an hour of mostly gentle questioning on ''The Early Show'' on CBS.

I think that's information that the voters need.''</p>

        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton defended her two-week-long wave of attacks on Representative Rick A. Lazio yesterday, asserting that she was simply trying to highlight contrasts between the two candidates for Senate, and disputing Mr. Lazio's contention that she was orchestrating a campaign based on fear.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the congressman has anything to fear from me; I think the only thing he has to fear is his own record,'' Mrs. Clinton said, emerging from an hour of mostly gentle questioning on ''The Early Show'' on CBS. ''I'm going to keep on demonstrating as clearly as I can to New Yorkers what his record is, what his positions have been, and how many times he has voted against the interests of New York. I think that's information that the voters need.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said that she had no apologies for either the remarks she had made about Mr. Lazio in speeches and news conferences, or the five advertisements her campaign has run attacking his record. Though it is unusual for a candidate in the early stages of a campaign to begin attacking an opponent, particularly with television ads, in this case, it reflects an attempt by Mrs. Clinton to use selected votes by Mr. Lazio to present him as more conservative than most voters in New York.</p>
        <p>''Campaigns are about information,'' Mrs. Clinton told Bryant Gumbel on the program, broadcast from the CBS affiliate in Syracuse. ''I don't think giving information is negative; I think it's informative. From my perspective, there's going to be a lot of contrast in this campaign.''</p>
        <p>Picking up the theme at a news conference after her television appearance, Mrs. Clinton said: ''Part of my campaign is to draw contrasts between me and my opponent. Because I believe the people upstate and the people in the rest of the state deserve to know where we stand on the issues.</p>
        <p>''It's summertime, and we've only got, what, four months left before the election,'' she continued. ''I have run for nearly a year against another opponent. And I have a new opponent, and it's a new campaign. And there are some people who say, you know, he's a more traditional Republican opponent and there are many differences between us on issues.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's remarks were in response to Mr. Lazio's assertion that she was distorting his views with advertisements highlighting votes he had cast, for example, against Democratic legislation that would allow patients to sue their H.M.O.'s. Mr. Lazio complained that the advertisements were ''about fear'' and predicted they would stir distrust of her among New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's spokesman, Dan McLagan, described Mrs. Clinton's remarks as ''a smoke screen to hide the fact that she has no record whatsoever of ever lifting a finger for New York or New Yorkers.''</p>
        <p>The exchange between the two candidates over campaign tactics -- there was little talk of policy differences yesterday -- comes at a time when Mrs. Clinton has been making a concerted effort to raise questions about Mr. Lazio's political views and credentials. There has been no evidence, in the form of polls, to suggest whether Mrs. Clinton's attacks have changed the course of the race.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, even some of Mr. Lazio's supporters said that the attacks appeared to have put him off-balance and forced him to devote time to dealing with them rather than laying the foundation of his campaign. And Mrs. Clinton left no doubt yesterday that she would continue a line of attack that her aides have concluded is successful.</p>
        <p>''These are real differences,'' she said. ''I am not calling him names, or engaging in the kind of activities that I don't approve of. That's not the kind of campaign I'm running.''</p>
