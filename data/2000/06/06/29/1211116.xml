      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Alas, the first program in Pilobolus Dance Theater's new season at the Joyce Theater is more or less a bust. The exception among the four pieces on Tuesday night was ''A Selection,'' created last year in collaboration with Maurice Sendak and Arthur Yorinks, directors of the Night Kitchen, a children's theater company.</p>
        <p>As an artist, Mr. Sendak has contributed not only a backdrop (a town aflame in the scary but compelling style of his book illustrations) but also an outside eye. ''A Selection,'' a phantasmagoria on a Holocaust theme, was commissioned by the American Dance Festival, which just awarded the company its Samuel H. Scripps-American Dance Festival Award for achievement in modern dance.</p>

        <p>Alas, the first program in Pilobolus Dance Theater's new season at the Joyce Theater is more or less a bust. The exception among the four pieces on Tuesday night was ''A Selection,'' created last year in collaboration with Maurice Sendak and Arthur Yorinks, directors of the Night Kitchen, a children's theater company.</p>
        <p>As an artist, Mr. Sendak has contributed not only a backdrop (a town aflame in the scary but compelling style of his book illustrations) but also an outside eye. ''A Selection,'' a phantasmagoria on a Holocaust theme, was commissioned by the American Dance Festival, which just awarded the company its Samuel H. Scripps-American Dance Festival Award for achievement in modern dance.</p>
        <p>The piece is full of enigmatic images with surreal and fearlessly tossed bodies. They are stunningly rendered by the troupe, especially Otis Cook as the rubber-legged personification of evil.</p>
        <p>Above all the work does not share divorce between ideas and movement as evident in the rest of the program.</p>
        <p>''Tsu-Ku-Tsu,'' a New York premiere, had all the earmarks of a work created on assignment. The springboard was a match between Pilobolus and Leonard Eto, a Japanese musician who takes a contemporary approach to the taiko drums, which are familiar from tours of Kodo drummers. Mr. Eto had approached the Dance Umbrella,  producer of experimental dance in Boston, for a collaborative project and was commissioned to work with Pilobolus.</p>
        <p>This was not an outlandish choice: one of the group's early and best duets was ''Shizen,'' accompanied by the haunting melody of a Japanese flute. But Alison Chase, who choreographed the new piece with help from the dancers, was faced here with percussion and rhythm. The beat and reverberation at the core of Mr. Eto's complex performance onstage are too dominant for the Pilobolus style.</p>
        <p>This is movement that usually banks on the linkage and leverage of bodies, which are reduced here to an image to two mini-sumo wrestlers locked in a hold. Elsewhere the choreography tends toward mere gymnastics without the metaphoric dimension one expects from Pilobolus.</p>
        <p>The idea of transformation nonetheless informs the initial image after Mr. Eto raises an arm to strike a big hanging drum before he moves on to the small drums. As Steven Strawbridge's lighting changes from near-obscurity, three crouched figures in Angelina Avallone's short kimonos are revealed to be six dancers (three on the backs of three others).</p>
        <p>A faster beat sends them rolling and tumbling on the floor. Springs in the air, cartwheels and dives precede the sumo duet for Mr. Cook and Gaspard Louis. Matt Kent and Benjamin Pring are part of some entangled clusters: Rebecca Anderson and Josie Coyoc, first leaning head to head, arch into backbends that leave them legs up.</p>
        <p>Some might see their grouping as a plant. Objectively, it is one of several isolated episodes. The end recalls the old nightclub  acrobatic adagio acts: upright performers supported in a fanny lift by a partner.</p>
        <p>''Femme Noire,'' choreographed by Ms. Chase in collaboration with Ms. Anderson and Rebecca Stenn, was a sketch on an angst-behind-the-glamour theme. Ms. Anderson, as a fashion model doing the backstroke on the floor and playing with a picture hat, did her best with a minimum of material.</p>
        <p>The sincerity behind ''Gnomen,'' a male quartet, is not in doubt, but neither is its sanctimonious tone. Mr. Cook, Mr. Kent, Mr. Louis and Mr. Pring each took turns as the protagonist either succored or stoned by the others.</p>
