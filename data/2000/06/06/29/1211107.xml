        <p>THE history of architecture reaches back past the palazzi and pyramids to the dawn of Simple Chic: the lean-to. But humankind was bested in its attempts to create a stylish habitat 500 million years earlier by, of all things, an invertebrate.</p>
        <p>The lowly mollusk should rightly be credited with creating the world's first beach house in the brilliant form of the seashell, that Cambrian-era dwelling that today is sometimes prized and polished, and sometimes trampled underfoot.</p>
        <p>Christopher Gow, importer, creator of objets and consummate handyman, would probably live in a seashell if he could. Long a fan and student of whelks, conchs, periwinkles et al., he is also a founder of Ruzzetti &amp; Gow, a Manhattan company that gathers shells around the world, silver-coats them in Rome and uses them to adorn antique and contemporary chandeliers and furniture. Mr. Gow, 37, sells seashells far from the seashore: this week, he is opening his first boutique, at 162 East 74th Street. But he has also converted a small apartment above a busy Midtown street into a combination living space, atelier and beach house.</p>
        <p>While others take citified polish to the seaside, Mr. Gow, who grew up in English coastal towns, made the reverse commute: he used the rudest of materials -- castoff fabric, flea-market finds, staples, glue and lots of shells -- to fashion an apartment that feels more like a getaway than many Hamptons retreats. ''It's outrageous, some of these places,'' he said. ''If you couldn't see the ocean, you'd think you were in the middle of the city. The antiques hail from 18th-century royal palaces.'' The standard for beach-house decor, he added, ''should be that if waves washed it all away, there should be nothing lost where the financial value is greater than the emotional value.''</p>
        <p>His own silver products are as polished as his own decor gets. Even his walls are relaxed. Mr. Gow, a specialist in 19th-century European sculpture at Sotheby's for the last decade, amassed auction catalog after catalog, finally finding himself with a mountain of records. In a simple, bold step, he stacked them above a bookcase in his apartment, without aid of shelves. Eventually an adjoining wall started to buckle, and the catalogs all shifted precariously sideways. In design terms, his ''nonfunctional library'' is a stunner. ''The more structurally unsound it is, the better, because it enhances the herringbone effect,'' he said of his Leaning Tower of Sotheby's. ''It really is moving, though, and I have a feeling something is going to go bump in the night soon.'' He seems perfectly at ease with the fact that it would be next to impossible to extract a single catalog without running a serious risk of avalanche. ''I don't think I would,'' he said frankly.</p>
        <p>Then there is his ingenious answer to the small, dreary terrace off a studio apartment Mr. Gow also rents one floor up. ''I was at a cocktail party at Princess Marina Pignatelli's,'' he explained, ''and I met this Australian man named Fabian Compton, and he told me how he painted these trompe l'oeil rugs on people's floors. And I told him I'd love to have a trompe l'oeil swimming pool.'' Now he has one, with a ''deep end'' painted a deeper blue. After all, if you're not going to use it, who needs the real thing?</p>
        <p>Mr. Gow (rhymes with wow) studied art history and decorative arts in France, but his is an Englishman's home, cozily filled with furnishings and bric-a-brac, and conducive to relaxation. Over 10 years, he has steadily brought in all manner of finds from street and flea market. He asked Mr. Compton to stencil a trompe l'oeil kilim onto the sea grass matting in his living room, which adds to the sense of crowded pattern.</p>
        <p>''It brings an aspect of whimsy to decor,'' Mr. Gow said. And it even fooled his mother, Joan Gow, who during a recent visit from Kent, England, tried to kick aside the ''rug'' to vacuum underneath.</p>
        <p>He installed an antique mantelpiece to create the illusion of a fireplace. And no problem was so big that it couldn't be covered up. ''That is some nasty thing covered with a drop cloth,'' he said, pointing to the white living room sofa strewn with Moroccan cushions.</p>
        <p>For his small study, Mr. Gow took a large piece of green silk he found in the rubbish at Sotheby's -- it had been used to wrap a sculpture from Japan -- and fashioned a harem-style ceiling with nothing more than a wire hanger and a stapler. ''There's not one terribly expensive thing in here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Except the silvered fruits de mer, which range from $50 for a starfish to $1,300 for a 22-inch-long conch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gow's love affair with water fauna dates at least to the time when, at 13, he won a marine biology prize for a paper on limpets. Now, shells fill jars in the kitchen, instead of food staples; they pile up in dresser drawers, where linens and clothes would be; they spill into the filing cabinet in the study. And what was once the dining room, and has been for five years the showroom, should rightly be called the grotto. On almost every surface sit silvered shells, sea urchins, starfish, pomegranates, ears of corn, asparagus, apples.</p>
        <p>Artisans have been practicing this kind of craftsmanship on the Italian peninsula since the days of the Roman Empire. The workshop used by Mr. Gow has been operated by the same family for generations and has for decades done restoration work on silver pieces for the Vatican. In the last two years, following the tradition of the Italian shell grottoes of the Baroque era, he began to decorate furnishings, and has designed some wrought-iron tables and light fixtures to resemble coral.</p>
        <p>All told, it's a transformation for a loft space that was formerly a Korean massage parlor, complete with bulletproof door. Before Mr. Gow started his renovation, the space had been divided only by several rudimentary walls (by an artist named Peanut Butter). More improvements were made by Mr. Gow's next roommate, an artist named Herbert Hoover, who made kitchen chandeliers out of conduit and bits of hardware. (His designs had a starring role in the film ''Runaway Bride,'' where they appeared as creations by Julia Roberts's character.)</p>
        <p>MR. GOW moved to New York after a stint working in Dallas as the curator of the private art collection of the developer Trammell Crow. He got an M.B.A. at Southern Methodist University and, in 1989, began working at Sotheby's. In 1995, his good friend Giampiero Ruzzetti came to town with a few seashells that had been silvered in Rome and proposed that they begin selling the shells as a sideline.</p>
        <p>The business took off, and Mr. Gow, who had studied malacology -- the branch of zoology dealing with mollusks -- while taking a degree in botany at Durham University in northern England, now found himself in a crash course in international shell buying: he wanted to take care, he said, to avoid trafficking in any shells from endangered species.</p>
        <p>He was happier with his freelance success than Sotheby's was. ''I remember I was up for my performance review, and they asked me how I thought my sideline was going,'' he said. ''And I said, 'Oh, the shells?' And they said, 'No, your work here at Sotheby's.' ''</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. Gow left the company, having bought out Mr. Ruzzetti, and began working from his West 37th Street apartment.</p>
        <p>He is flattered by the suggestion that he appears to share the mollusk's talent for creating a comfortable, compelling environment with what is more or less readily at hand. ''Except that a mollusk's shell increases in size, and mine hasn't,'' he said. ''It's just grown inside with objects that have come and gone.''</p>
        <p>Many of those objects are going to the new Ruzzetti &amp; Gow store and showroom on East 74th Street. But enough arrangements will remain to form an octopus's garden. His idea of home is a place where ''everything is chosen to be stimulating to the eye, but also for comfort factor,'' he said, displaying an attitude toward decor that many English people share.</p>
        <p>In ''The Englishman's Room,'' David Hicks, the interior designer, described his countrymen's fondness for a cosmopolitan collection of furniture, books and objects ''somehow sympathetic to each other'' as ''far less studied than many American rooms -- and far cozier than European ones.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gow agrees. ''That's the beauty of English decorating: the stylishness and comfort,'' he said. ''Too many American interiors are too contrived and put together purely for aesthetic criteria.''</p>
        <p>And while his precious shells have an almost kitschy element of ostentation, Mr. Gow says they are not intended as such.</p>
        <p>''It's about bringing nature back into the environment,'' he said. ''The silver heightens the contrasts, and it enhances the texture of the outside, while the inside stays intact.''</p>
        <p>The silver is not meant to one-up nature, he said, but ''to ennoble it.''</p>
        <p>Knowing when to stop is important. ''Barbra Streisand wanted a rose,'' Mr. Gow said. ''We had a courier hand-carry it back from Italy, but it didn't pass quality control. There are very few cases in which we can improve on nature. Most things are better left and appreciated as they are.''</p>
