        <p>Elian Returns to Cuba After Justices Decline Case  Elian Gonzalez returned to Cuba with his father and other family members aboard a chartered jet, hours after the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal brought by Miami relatives who wanted an asylum hearing for the boy.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Sadness and anger pervaded the crowd that gathered outside the house in Little Havana, in Miami, where Elian was taken shortly after being found at sea in an inner tube in November and where he lived during most of the custody battle.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Russia Unveils Economic Plan  The Kremlin issued its long-awaited plan to overhaul Russia's economy. It would slash subsidies that have held down utility rates, devise a new energy policy and wipe out unpaid wages, tax breaks and other obligations that sap government spending power. The announcement almost overshadowed another major event: a vote in Parliament's upper house against President Vladimir V. Putin's plan to effectively disband it.</p>

        <p>U.S. and Russian Missile Plan  Russia and the United States will hold a joint defense exercise against short- and medium-range missiles, an American official said.</p>

        <p>Delay Urged on Missile Defense  A group of more than 40 China scholars and former diplomats want President Clinton to delay a decision on building a national missile defense, saying it may do more harm than good to American interests.</p>

        <p>Iraqi Storms U.N. Office  An Iraqi man brandishing two machine guns and explosives shot his way into a United Nations office in Baghdad, Iraq, killing 2 people, wounding 7 and taking about 50 hostage. After a siege of nearly three hours, he gave himself up, saying he wanted an end to United Nations sanctions against his country.</p>

        <p>Two Iranian Reformers Jailed  Iranian officials sent a student leader and a human rights lawyer to jail without trial. At the same time, the national police commander held responsible in an attack on student protesters last year was fired.</p>

        <p>Mideast Meeting in Doubt  The Israelis and Palestinians appeared to remain far from meeting the conditions set down by the Clinton administration for an early summit meeting in Washington.</p>

        <p>Court Rules Governments Can't Ban Type of Abortion  The Supreme Court, ruling 5 to 4 in a Nebraska case, said the government cannot bar doctors from using a procedure widely known as ''partial-birth abortion,'' because it may be the most medically appropriate way of terminating some pregnancies.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Boy Scouts Can Bar Gays  The Supreme Court, ruling 5 to 4 in a New Jersey case, said the Boy Scouts may exclude gay members because opposition to homosexuality is part of their ''expressive message.''</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>House Endorses Drug Benefit  The House passed a bill offering prescription benefits to 39 million elderly and disabled people on Medicare, but only after Democrats walked off the floor to express frustration at being unable to get a full debate on a proposal to establish more extensive drug coverage.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Campaign Finance Legislation  The House overwhelmingly passed bipartisan legislation to require tax-exempt groups that raise and spend money on political advocacy to disclose their activities and donors.</p>
        <p>A21</p>
        <p>Defending Gore on Fund-Raising  President Clinton, in a wide-ranging news conference, defended Vice President Al Gore against accusations of campaign finance irregularities, saying that Mr. Gore had made ''a compelling case'' that he did nothing wrong.</p>
        <p>A21</p>
        <p>No Pass for Reagan Attacker  A Washington psychiatric hospital withdrew its recommendation that a court let John W. Hinckley Jr. leave the hospital for unsupervised weekly visits with his parents.</p>
        <p>A18</p>
        <p>California Official Steps Down  Chuck Quackenbush resigned as insurance commissioner rather than risk impeachment over accusations that he diverted millions in earthquake insurance settlements.</p>

        <p>EDUCATION</p>

        <p>Effort on Police Corruption Is Inefficient, Panel Says  A commission appointed by Mayor Giuliani to monitor the Police Department's anti-corruption efforts has found the internal system for disciplining officers staffed with inexperienced lawyers and mired in delays, according to a draft report.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Fallout From Power Failure  Mayor Giuliani, responding to an East Side power failure on Monday, accused Con Edison of shoddy management and said he was reinstating an investigatory panel to review the utility's service to consumers. The city's top lawyer withdrew a settlement offer arising from last year's Washington Heights blackout.</p>
        <p>B1</p>
        <p>Transforming Yellow Cab Fleet  The Taxi and Limousine Commission will hold a hearing on a proposal to require new yellow cabs bought after July 1, 2001, to be wheelchair accessible, meaning they would mostly be tall sport-utility vehicles.</p>
