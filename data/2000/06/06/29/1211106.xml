      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The romantic and political intrigues of an imaginary India were as exciting as ever when a new set of dancers took over the principal roles in ''La Bayadere'' at American Ballet Theater's performance on Monday night at the Metropolitan Opera House. Solor, Nikiya and Gamzatti, the three leading characters, seemed young people tragically caught up by forces beyond their control.</p>
        <p>The evening was dominated by the Solor of Angel Corella. This impetuous warrior rushed headlong into the ballet's dramatic complications. Mr. Corella soared through his solo in the betrothal scene, and his dancing grew ever more exultant in the Kingdom of the Shades scene.</p>

        <p>The romantic and political intrigues of an imaginary India were as exciting as ever when a new set of dancers took over the principal roles in ''La Bayadere'' at American Ballet Theater's performance on Monday night at the Metropolitan Opera House. Solor, Nikiya and Gamzatti, the three leading characters, seemed young people tragically caught up by forces beyond their control.</p>
        <p>The evening was dominated by the Solor of Angel Corella. This impetuous warrior rushed headlong into the ballet's dramatic complications. Mr. Corella soared through his solo in the betrothal scene, and his dancing grew ever more exultant in the Kingdom of the Shades scene.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Ashley Tuttle was delicate as Nikiya, the temple dancer who loves Solor. Although her dancing was strong and secure, there was an appealing vulnerability about her characterization, and she resembled an elusive spirit in the Kingdom of the Shades.</p>
        <p>Because Gamzatti, who also loves Solor, is blessed with wealth and social status and is used to having her own way, she can easily appear mean-spirited and little more. Gillian Murphy's dancing expressed Gamzatti's pride. But there was an intensity in her miming that suggested how sincerely, and even desperately, Gamzatti desired Solor.</p>
        <p>The corps de ballet, led by Oksana Konobeyeva, Ekaterina Shelkanova and Irina Dvorovenko, was once again exquisitely precise as the spectral Shades. Guillaume Graffin looked dignified as the Radjah, and Sascha Radetsky seemed appropriately demented as the grotesque Head Fakir. David Lamarche conducted.</p>
