        <p>A young boy was hit and killed by an Amtrak train yesterday evening on an elevated section of tracks along the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The boy, who the police said was 11 or 12, was hit about 7:40 p.m. near 135th Street and 12th Avenue, an industrial area that is a popular spot for graffiti writers. There were spray cans found near the body, the police said.</p>
        <p>As the train, which originated in Montreal, approached, the engineer saw three children on the tracks, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>''The engineer saw them, he tooted his horn, he engaged his brakes,'' said Capt. Thomas E. Cody of the 30th Precinct. ''Unfortunately, he wasn't able to come to a stop in time.''</p>
