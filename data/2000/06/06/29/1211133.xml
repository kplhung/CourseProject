        <p>It is important that Jews and Catholics continue to improve relations. Much progress has been made, but the future depends on honesty and sensitivity.</p>
        <p>In commenting on the Italian Jewish Communities' objection to the beatification of Pope Pius IX (news article, June 28), Msgr. Carlos Liberati, the Vatican official overseeing Pius's cause, said: ''The church has tried everything to improve relations with the Jews. But they don't forgive us the slightest thing.''</p>
        <p>The ''slightest thing'' is the forced baptism and later kidnapping by the church of 6-year-old Edgardo Mortara from his Jewish parents in Bologna in 1858.</p>
        <p>How can we ascend to higher ground when such a grievous injustice against a Jewish family and the Jewish community is dismissed as a slight thing?</p>
