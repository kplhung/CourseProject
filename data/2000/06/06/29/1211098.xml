        <p>Domesticated Texas Bluebells</p>
        <p>Q. I've loved Lisianthus in florists' arrangements, so I bought a potted one. But now I realize that I know nothing about the plant. It seems to need a lot of water because it wilts readily. I assume it's an annual. Can it be planted outside? Does it bloom constantly?  A. Lisianthus russellianus is another name for Eustoma grandiflorum, the prairie gentian, or Texas bluebell, originally a wildflower of the Western plains.</p>

        <p>Domesticated Texas Bluebells</p>
        <p>Q. I've loved Lisianthus in florists' arrangements, so I bought a potted one. But now I realize that I know nothing about the plant. It seems to need a lot of water because it wilts readily. I assume it's an annual. Can it be planted outside? Does it bloom constantly?  A. Lisianthus russellianus is another name for Eustoma grandiflorum, the prairie gentian, or Texas bluebell, originally a wildflower of the Western plains.</p>
        <p>Of course you can plant it outside. You can plant anything outside, temporarily, anyway. Choose a spot in full but not broiling sun where the soil is neutral to slightly alkaline, well drained and not too rich. Be careful when transplanting, the delicate taproot resents disturbance.</p>
        <p>Feed sparingly, and water only when the soil is dry an inch down. Unless it has outgrown its pot, there's a good chance your plant is wilting because it's too wet, rather than the reverse. Lisianthus is vulnerable to a wide range of fungi, molds and bacteria, all of which thrive in damp conditions.</p>
        <p>Prairie gentian is a slow-growing annual (or biennial grown as an annual) that will flower for two months or more, depending on the variety. Frost will kill it, but by then it will probably be all bloomed out.</p>
        <p>Until about 20 years ago, if you could find Lisianthus at all, you could count on it to be two to three feet tall and a third as wide, with single pale purple flowers. These days, there are many variants, often sold without descriptive labels. You can get doubles. You can get them in rose, white, blue or picotee. You can also get much smaller plants. If yours has Lisa or Mermaid in its name, it will never be more than about eight inches tall.</p>
        <p>They'll Be Sorry</p>
        <p>Q. I have read that cayenne pepper can be used to ward off squirrels. How does it work? Are the peppers hung like tree ornaments? Sprinkled on the ground? I tried using camphor balls around the plants, but the neighbors complained about the smell and when I last looked the squirrels were thriving.  A. The active ingredient is capsaicin (pronounced cap-SAY-ih-sin), the chemical that makes hot peppers hot. It burns anything it touches and is particularly excruciating on the sensitive membranes in mammalian eyes, noses and mouths. Birds appear to be unaffected; capsaicin is used as a coating for birdseed to discourage squirrel raids.</p>
        <p>To defend against rabbits, squirrels, deer and muggers, you can buy commercial repellents that contain pure capsaicin, or you can make a kitchen cupboard version. One formula calls for mixing  1/2 cup finely chopped jalapenos or the much hotter habaneros with  1/2 gallon of water. Boil for 20 minutes, strain and use as a spray. Be sure to use gloves while working with the peppers. Keep the pot covered, let it cool covered and don't inhale the vapors; hot or cold, capsaicin is highly volatile and can burn.</p>
        <p>You can also just buy large quantities of ground cayenne and, observing the same caution, sprinkle it on the cherished items. Either way, the pepper will have to be reapplied at least once a week and after every heavy dew or rain.</p>
        <p>It is not as foolproof as it sounds. You have to assure contact; vapors dissipate rapidly, and the smell alone won't do it. Many animals rapidly become used to, if not fond of, spicy food. And it's easy to forget and get burned yourself, especially if you touch the protected plant and then rub your eyes.</p>
        <p>That's primarily how it works against squirrels, by the way. They rub their faces with their peppery paws and wind up in agony. But squirrels are not stellar learners; some of them make the connection and some don't.</p>
