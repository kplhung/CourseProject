        <p>That is how the marketing executives at M&amp;M/Mars see it, anyway. So, after 46 years, the company has decided to change the name of its Plain variety of M&amp;M's candy -- you know, the one without the peanuts -- to what it hopes is a more appetizing moniker: Milk Chocolate.</p>

        <p>''WHAT does the word ''plain'' insinuate? Dull, bland, simple, ordinary, boring?</p>
        <p>That is how the marketing executives at M&amp;M/Mars see it, anyway. So, after 46 years, the company has decided to change the name of its Plain variety of M&amp;M's candy -- you know, the one without the peanuts -- to what it hopes is a more appetizing moniker: Milk Chocolate.</p>
        <p>''The name change is a long time coming,'' said Michael Tolkowsky, vice president for marketing and licensing at the M&amp;M/Mars division of Mars Inc. in Hackettstown, N.J.</p>
        <p>''For all this time,'' he added, ''we've always internally sort of felt like 'Hey, that's not nearly the best way to refer to it.' M&amp;M's milk chocolate is too good to be called Plain.' "</p>
        <p>To spread the word about the name change, M&amp;M/Mars is introducing an ambitious multimedia campaign that begins this week. The $10 million campaign, created by BBDO New York, carries the theme: ''Same great chocolate. Much better name.''</p>
        <p>The campaign takes the tongue-in-cheek tone that has recently become a staple of ads for M&amp;M's, which are centered on animated anthropomorphic confectionery characters with contemporary personas infused with attributes like sarcastic humor and sassy tongues. The M&amp;M's characters have been around since 1954, but they had pleasant, passive personalities, all but begging consumers to eat them.</p>
        <p>That went the way of the 5-cent candy bar in 1995 when BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, was awarded the M&amp;M account.</p>
        <p>''When we got the business, the characters were very appealing, but they were somewhat two-dimensional,'' said Charlie Miesmer, vice chairman and senior executive creative director at BBDO New York, who oversees the M&amp;M's creative effort along with Susan Credle, a copywriter, and Steve Rutter, an art director. ''We've made them somewhat irreverent kind of characters that are human.''</p>
        <p>''So when the need comes five years later to announce a product change,'' he added, ''you can do it in the context of that background.''</p>
        <p>One aspect of the campaign is to lampoon America's seeming preoccupation with politically correct speech. In one spot that mimics a public service announcement, to be shown on television and in movie theaters, people describe their jobs with euphemisms like ''administrative assistant'' for secretary and ''domestic care giver'' for baby sitter. They are followed by the Red M&amp;M's character, which declares, ''I am not a Plain M&amp;M, I am a Milk Chocolate M&amp;M.''</p>
        <p>Another commercial features Patrick Warburton, the actor best known for his role as Elaine's boyfriend Puddy in ''Seinfeld.'' Mr. Warburton, who has appeared in three other spots for M&amp;M's, is seen with Red looking up synonyms for ''plain'' in a thesaurus. As Mr. Warburton rattles off several unflattering synonyms, Red asks, ''So you think 'plain' is a bad word?'' With restrained contempt, Mr. Warburton looks at Red and says, ''Let's look up 'stupid.' ''</p>
        <p>''His delivery is marvelous,'' Mr. Miesmer said. ''He has this wonderful, restrained, laconic kind of humor.''</p>
        <p>A print ad features Red, with an unusually enlarged head, growling to his fellow character Yellow, ''Whaddya mean this name change has gone to my head?'' The ad will appear through early fall in publications including Cosmopolitan, GQ, People, Rolling Stone and Sports Illustrated.</p>
        <p>Other elements of the campaign will include a satellite ''media tour'' featuring the Red character and promotional tie-ins at the Nascar Independence Race on Saturday in Daytona, Fla.</p>
        <p>The name change takes the Plain variety back to its original designation at its debut in 1941; the name was switched from Milk Chocolate to Plain when the Peanut variety was introduced in 1954.</p>
        <p>There have been other changes, like an updating of the logo and the addition of pictures of M&amp;M candy pieces, but the familiar brown-and-white color scheme remains the same. M&amp;M/Mars did research among consumers to determine whether the name change would be deemed confusing, Mr. Tolkowksy said, and found it would not be.</p>
        <p>Not everyone, though, agrees it's a good idea.</p>
        <p>''I think it's just a bad case of what I call tinkering,'' said Jack Trout, president of Trout &amp; Partners, a marketing strategy company in Greenwich, Conn.</p>
        <p>''People's habits change so slowly,'' he added, ''and if that has been called Plain, then it's Plain. I don't care what you call it.''</p>
