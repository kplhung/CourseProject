        <p>Musical Surprise And Financial One</p>
        <p>OPRAH WINFREY managed a surprise yesterday that topped the surprise that had been planned.</p>
        <p>The planned surprise was a performance by the choir of the Abyssinian Baptist Church at a lunch for A Better Chance, a nonprofit organization that places minority children in a network of 200 private and public high schools.</p>
        <p>The president of A Better Chance, JUDITH B. GRIFFIN, sings in the choir and arranged the appearance at the Waldorf-Astoria without telling her fellow singers that they would be singing for Ms. Winfrey.</p>
        <p>Ms. Winfrey had not been told about the choir's appearance, either, and when Ms. Griffin announced it, Ms. Winfrey's mouth formed the word ''wow,'' and she sang along.</p>
        <p>The performance was Ms. Griffin's way of thanking Ms. Winfrey for spreading the word about A Better Chance as only Ms. Winfrey could.</p>
        <p>''We said we needed to make the organization visible'' when Ms. Winfrey became involved with A Better Chance, Ms. Griffin said. ''Being on your show twice certainly gave us that, particularly the show where you gave me $1.2 million.''</p>
        <p>When the choir finished, it was Ms. Winfrey's turn at the microphone.</p>
        <p>''I have written a check for $10 million,'' she said. She handed it to Ms. Griffin, who was, for the moment, speechless -- she said the word ''shock'' -- and hugged Ms. Winfrey. Then Ms. Winfrey left the ballroom, trailed by what appeared to be two plainclothes security men.</p>
        <p>Lazio Complains Of Air Assault</p>
        <p>The only thing that was not predictable was the computer file name that REPRESENTATIVE RICK A. LAZIO'S campaign used for a press release complaining that HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON'S Senate campaign should reimburse the government for her time on the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy during OpSail 2000 next week. The file name was ''Air Strike.doc.''</p>
        <p>''It is clearly no accident that the first lady and her husband have chosen New York -- a state whose only connection to them is Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign -- as the site of their Indepedence Day activities,'' Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, BILL DAL COL, said in ''Air Strike.doc.'' ''Calling this an 'official' event is laughable.''</p>
        <p>A Tough Way To Get a Cab</p>
        <p>The actor DANNY GLOVER, whose complaints of discrimination by cabdrivers prompted Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to order an undercover sting operation last November, is shooting a film in which he plays a taxi driver.</p>
        <p>''He's putting himself in the cabdriver's place,'' said PAM GRIER, who portrays Mr. Glover's girlfriend, a waitress in a diner next door to the taxi dispatcher's office. ''He's bringing a spotlight to the fact that the paranoia of fear has created an injustice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Glover filed a complaint with the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission in November, charging a cabdriver with discrimination for refusing to allow him to ride in the front passenger seat. Mr. Glover, who is black and has a bad hip that he said made him uncomfortable in the rear seats of cabs, said he was already angry because five cabs had not stopped for him several hours earlier.</p>
        <p>A week later, the mayor said the city would take away the taxis of drivers who were caught refusing to pick up minority passengers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Grier said that the film, ''3 A.M.,'' is about a serial killer who preys on cabdrivers. It was written and is being directed by LEE DAVIS, a longtime assistant director for SPIKE LEE'S 40 Acres and a Mule production company.</p>
        <p>''We're dealing with the fear of cabdrivers and how they think,'' Ms. Grier said. ''It's a paranoia that can be overblown, and paranoia grows. I think how our democratic society works is you walk a mile in another man's shoes. He's portraying someone from another point of view.''</p>
