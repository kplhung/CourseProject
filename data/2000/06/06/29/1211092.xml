        <p>Q. I have impaired vision and find that the white background and black type used in Microsoft Word documents is hard on my eyes. Is there any way to change the background color of the documents for easier reading?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, there is a setting within Microsoft Word that will let you create and use documents that have a dark blue background with white text on the screen. You may find that combination easier to read, and your files will still print normally.</p>

        <p>Q. I have impaired vision and find that the white background and black type used in Microsoft Word documents is hard on my eyes. Is there any way to change the background color of the documents for easier reading?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, there is a setting within Microsoft Word that will let you create and use documents that have a dark blue background with white text on the screen. You may find that combination easier to read, and your files will still print normally.</p>
        <p>To change the setting in Microsoft Word 97 and 2000 for Windows, open the Word document you want to view, go to Tools in the menu bar and select Options. A box with several tabs will pop up on the screen. Click on the General tab and then check the box for ''Blue background, white text.'' Click on O.K.</p>
        <p>If you are a Macintosh and Word 98 user, go to the Tools menu in the Mac's menu bar and select Preferences from the list. That will call up the tabbed Preferences box. Click on the General tab, check the ''Blue background, white text'' box and  click on O.K.</p>
        <p>Windows and Macintosh systems have a number of features to help users with impaired vision and other disabilities use the computer more easily. In Windows 98, for example, if you go to the Start menu, then to Settings and to Control Panel, then double-click on Accessibility Options, you can change your screen to a high-contrast, white-on-black display with extra-large fonts and icons. Within Accessibility Options, you can also assign mouse functions to the keyboard and create keyboard shortcuts for common tasks.</p>
        <p>You may also want to use the Windows 98 Accessibility Wizard to set up your system for better ease of use. To find the Accessibility Wizard, go to the Start menu, then to Programs. Find Accessories on the list and then go to Accessibility, where you should find the Accessibility Wizard. (If you do not find it on the list, it may not have been installed on your computer and you will have to install it from your Windows 98 CD-ROM.)</p>
        <p>Microsoft has a detailed section about Accessibility on its Web site at www.microsoft.com/enable. The page is full of links to documentation on customizing Windows to suit your needs, as well as guides for special hardware and software products. You can also sign up for a newsletter on accessibility issues and get a free documentary video on the topic.</p>
        <p>Apple Computer has also included  a number of options in the Macintosh operating system that are designed to aid users with disabilities. In most versions of the Mac OS, you can find items called CloseView and EasyAccess in the Control Panels area under the Apple menu. (Version 9 of the Mac OS calls that control panel Universal Access.) CloseView will let you magnify the contents of your screen up to 16 times, and EasyAccess will allow you to assign mouse functions to keys and condense multiple keystroke commands to just one key, amoong other features. With the Mac's Speech control panel, you can also configure the Mac to read the text of alert boxes out loud.</p>
        <p>You can find more information on adjusting the Macintosh for special needs on Apple's site at www.apple .com/education/k12/disability. The page contains links to a library of Apple software and other shareware designed for users with disabilities, as well a product guide and news updates.</p>
        <p>Q. I am left-handed and find it hard to ''right click'' with the mouse. Can I change the functions of the two mouse buttons?</p>
        <p>A. You can reverse the functions of the buttons on your mouse by going to the Start menu, then to Settings and the Control Panel. Double-click on the Mouse control panel and click on the button for Left-handed. That will reassign the old ''right click'' contextual menus and special dragging function to the outside button on the standard mouse and put the normal click and drag functions on the inside button for left-handers.</p>
