        <p>The Nasdaq composite index had its biggest gain in seven sessions yesterday as investors flocked to technology shares while shunning most blue-chip standbys.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index jumped 81.38 points, or 2.1 percent, to  3,940.34, its best advance since June 19. Major contributors were the four Nasdaq stocks that Lehman Brothers selected as ''uncommon values'' that would outperform the broad market over the next 12 months.</p>
        <p>Juniper Networks surged 10, to 136 7/16; BEA Systems, 7 3/64, to 45 63/64; Tellabs, 5 5/16, to 68; and Gemstar International, 4 1/2, to 54 3/8. Of the six other Lehman picks, Hewlett-Packard rose 7 1/16, to 123 11/16; Agilent Technologies, 4 5/16, to 79 3/4; Cendant, 1 3/8, to 14 1/4; Eli Lilly, 2 3/8, to 87 1/8; and Nortel Networks,  7/8, to 67 7/8. Micron Technology slumped 1 1/2, to 88 1/2.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average, which at one stage was up nearly 116 points, held on to a gain of just 23.33 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,527.79.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 4.27 points, to finish at 1,454.82.</p>
        <p>All major gauges gave ground after the Federal Reserve warned of a continued inflation risk even though, as expected, it took no action to raise short-term interest rates further. Analysts said they found nothing in the central bank's statement to dispel the belief that at least one more rate increase, probably at the Aug. 22 meeting, was likely, barring the appearance of convincing evidence that economic growth had slowed.</p>
        <p>''That cloud is still going to be hovering over the party,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer for Wells Capital Management.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Paulsen also pointed to the next wave of corporate earnings, which will start being announced next month and which should be about 20 percent higher than in the second quarter of 1999. If this coincides with perceptions of an economy that has moved from unsustainably rapid growth to one headed for a so-called soft landing, then that ''could be a dynamite combination'' for stocks, he said.</p>
        <p>''The Fed basically said there are still inflation worries,'' said Kenneth Sheinberg, head of listed trading at SG Cowen.</p>
        <p>Sixteen of the Dow's 30 stocks fell yesterday, but hefty gains by Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., up 3 7/8, to 113 5/8, and Coca-Cola, up 2 1/8, to 60, kept the average in positive territory.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Fall  By Reuters</p>
        <p>Treasury bond prices fell yesterday after the Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged but left the door open for a rate increase in August.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 7/32, to 104 5/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.95 percent from 5.94 percent.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury note increased 4/32, to 102 29/32. The note's yield declined to 6.10 percent from 6.08 percent on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>In corporate finance, the German telephone giant Deutsche Telekom  sold $9.5 billion of dollar-denominated bonds yesterday as part of its record $14.6 billion global bond sale. The dollar portion was increased 90 percent from an original $5 billion.</p>
        <p>Results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes:</p>
        <p>(000 omitted in dollar figures)</p>
        <p>High Price: 99.800  High Yield: 6.483%  Low Yield: 6.400%  Median Yield: 6.470%  Accepted at low price: 67%  Total applied for: $31,326,386  Accepted: $14,310,797  Noncompetitive: $1,615,777  Interest set at: 6 3/8</p>
        <p>The two-year notes mature June 30, 2002.</p>
