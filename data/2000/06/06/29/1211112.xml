        <p>Mr. Carroll, 58, grew up in Texas, where his uncle ran a honky-tonk: ''I learned swing, the two-step and the cowboy stuff at a very early age.'' After the Air Force and an early career in television production, his interest in software took him to NASA and then to Boeing. And, of course, he kept dancing.</p>
        <p>''Most good engineers also have a strong creative bent,'' he says. ''Otherwise, they would just be plodders.'' He has just added a new page to his site for people who want to learn the steps in just one minute. He has called it, with an engineer's precision, ''0 to Tango in 60 Seconds.''</p>
