        <p>Scarcely two hours after the polls closed on Tuesday night, Representative Merrill Cook acknowledged the inevitable. His turbulent three and a half years representing Utah's Second Congressional District had caught up with him.</p>
        <p>With fewer than half the votes counted, Mr. Cook conceded to Derek W. Smith, a business owner and political newcomer who went on to win nearly 59 percent of the vote, making Mr. Cook the first Republican incumbent to lose in a primary this year. One incumbent Democrat has fallen, Representative Matthew G. Martinez of California's 31st District, who lost to State Senator Hilda Solis.</p>
        <p>But unlike Ms. Solis, who has no opponent in November, Mr. Smith will face a formidable challenger, Jim Matheson, a political neophyte, as well, but also the son of an immensely popular former governor, the late Scott M. Matheson. With Democrats needing a swing of six seats to regain the House majority they lost in 1994, this is one seat they believe they have a strong chance to win back.</p>
        <p>The winner will become the district's fifth representative in the last 10 years.</p>
        <p>In Utah's other major Republican primary, Gov. Michael O. Leavitt withstood a spirited challenge from the right and defeated Glen P. Davis with 61 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leavitt, who is seeking a third four-year term, will face Bill Orton, a former Democratic congressman, in the general election, a contest that could be competitive because of the high profiles of both candidates.</p>
        <p>The victory by Mr. Smith ended a seven-week campaign that turned from nasty to nastier, reaching a climax of sorts on a Salt Lake City street last Wednesday, when he and Mr. Cook stood for 45 minutes arguing as reporters looked on.</p>
        <p>Their confrontation was a continuation of verbal assaults over personal finances, voting habits and prospects for success in November. Yet for Mr. Cook, it was just the latest chapter in a brief Congressional career that was never short of distractions.</p>
        <p>More than for any notable legislation, he brought attention to himself here and in Washington for public temper tantrums, staff turnover and a recent trial in which a jury found that he had not paid a former consultant almost $200,000.</p>
        <p>In his brief concession speech, Mr. Cook accused reporters of blowing his past out of proportion and denounced the Republican leadership in Washington for withholding full support, saying, ''You can't win when the party big shots won't stand up for you.'' And today, he expanded the blame to include Democrats who had voted in the open primary solely to drive him out of office and disgruntled former employees.</p>
        <p>He also broadened his criticism of party leaders, accusing them of following ''two sets of rules, one for incumbents, one for Merrill Cook.''</p>
        <p>He did receive considerable help from many leading Republicans. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, and the House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, and the majority whip, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, all traveled to Utah to raise money for Mr. Cook.</p>
        <p>But some other House Republicans, including Representative Christopher B. Cannon, who represents Utah's Third Congressional District, supported Mr. Smith.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cook, who became wealthy as the owner of an explosives company, vowed that his political career would not end after November, hinting that he might return as an independent, which he has done before. In eight years as an independent before he won the Congressional seat, he ran twice for governor and once for mayor of Salt Lake City, the Congressional seat, the school board and the Salt Lake County Commission -- losing all six times.</p>
        <p>Still wide-eyed after a sleepless night, much of it spent celebrating, Mr. Smith said he felt relieved that he could now look forward to a campaign against Mr. Matheson that he predicted would focus more on issues than personality. He said a barrage of attacks by Mr. Cook had forced him to spend time defending himself, rather than discussing issues like education reform, tax cuts, job creation and expanding voter participation through use of the Internet.</p>
        <p>In Washington, Representative Thomas M. Davis III, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a statement that the party would now throw its full support behind Mr. Smith.</p>
        <p>''The bad news is a Republican incumbent lost,'' Mr. Davis, of Virginia, said. ''The good news is we have a strong nominee in this seat for the fall. Merrill Cook has been a fine representative for the citizens of Utah, working tirelessly on their behalf. His presence will be missed here in Washington after November. I wish him all the best, and I am confident he will join us in supporting Derek Smith this fall.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cook said he would have to think about it.</p>
