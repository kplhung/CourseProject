        <p>The Kmart Corporation has unexpectedly placed its account in review after more than five years at Campbell Mithun in Minneapolis, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Billings were estimated at $100 million.</p>
        <p>Stephen Pagnani, a spokesman for Kmart in Troy, Mich., confirmed a report about the review yesterday in the daily fax edition of Advertising Age.

        <p>The Kmart Corporation has unexpectedly placed its account in review after more than five years at Campbell Mithun in Minneapolis, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Billings were estimated at $100 million.</p>
        <p>Stephen Pagnani, a spokesman for Kmart in Troy, Mich., confirmed a report about the review yesterday in the daily fax edition of Advertising Age. He attributed the decision to the selection of a new chairman and chief executive, Charles Conaway, who will seek to stimulate sales that have sagged in the face of increased competition from retailers like Target and Wal-Mart.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pagnani described the review as open, adding that Campbell Mithun would take part. The review is to be narrowed to five or so agencies in late July, he said, with a decision expected by September.</p>
        <p>Lori Mikesell, a spokeswoman for Campbell Mithun, said the agency would ''enthusiastically'' participate. Campbell Mithun is best known for Kmart campaigns featuring Penny Marshall and Rosie O'Donnell and a Big K commercial that featured Bob Hope.</p>
