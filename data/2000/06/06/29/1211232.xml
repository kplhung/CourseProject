        <p>South Korean news reports said Ford Motor had won exclusive negotiating rights to buy the heavily indebted Daewoo Motor from a committee of creditors, beating out rival bids from an alliance between DaimlerChrysler and Hyundai Motor and an alliance between General Motors and Fiat. The Korea Economic Daily said the Ford and Daimler-Hyundai bids were each about $6 billion and the G.M.-Fiat bid was lower. G.M. said its alliance was still bidding. None of the other companies or the creditors would comment on the reports.</p>
