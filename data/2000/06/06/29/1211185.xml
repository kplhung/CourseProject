        <p>A group of more than 40 American scholars on China and former diplomats is urging President Clinton to delay a decision on whether to build a national missile defense, arguing that the proposed system may do more harm than good to American economic and military interests.</p>
        <p>''We are concerned that a precipitous decision to deploy would adversely affect U.S. relations with China,'' the group says in a letter to be issued on Thursday, ''by unnecessarily increasing tensions between the two countries and provoking a series of negative steps by China that would undermine American security.''</p>

        <p>A group of more than 40 American scholars on China and former diplomats is urging President Clinton to delay a decision on whether to build a national missile defense, arguing that the proposed system may do more harm than good to American economic and military interests.</p>
        <p>''We are concerned that a precipitous decision to deploy would adversely affect U.S. relations with China,'' the group says in a letter to be issued on Thursday, ''by unnecessarily increasing tensions between the two countries and provoking a series of negative steps by China that would undermine American security.''</p>
        <p>Signers of the letter, which was to be delivered to the White House, include an ambassador to China under President Reagan as well as China specialists from around the United States. Signatures were gathered by the Council for a Livable World, a private group in Washington that lobbies for nuclear disarmament.</p>
        <p>Strong political momentum has gathered for construction of a limited defensive system intended to protect against a possible small missile attack from countries like North Korea or Iraq. Mr. Clinton is supposed to decide this summer, after a key test on July 7, whether to begin construction of radars in Alaska.</p>
        <p>But many foreign policy experts, scientists and former security officials have questioned the plan on technical or strategic grounds, and it is strongly opposed by Russia, China and even American allies in Europe.</p>
        <p>''I'm concerned that the plan will raise the stakes in the arms race by stimulating the Chinese and others to make more missiles,'' said one signer of the letter, Arthur W. Hummel Jr., who was ambassador to China from 1981 to 1985. ''Second, I have grave doubts about whether it will work.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, a group of former top officials including retired Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Sam Nunn, a former Senator from Georgia who was influential on military issues, and William J. Perry, a former Defense Secretary, made a similar public call for delay, as did a separate group of Russia experts.</p>
        <p>The proposed system, which involves 100 missile interceptors based in Alaska in the first stage, would violate the Antiballistic Missile Treaty signed with the Soviet Union in 1972. The administration has tried, without success, to persuade Russia to agree to treaty revisions, arguing that limited defenses would not undermine Russia's nuclear forces.</p>
        <p>But China's objections run deeper.  Officials here say that in a showdown with the United States, the deterrent effect of China's small nuclear force, which includes perhaps 20 long-range missiles, would be vitiated by the American plan. Officials warn that China will be forced to build far more missiles or develop decoy measures, and say the American plan will set off a global arms race.</p>
        <p>American officials respond that China plans to improve its missile forces anyway and that the proposed defenses are not intended to offset Chinese power.</p>
