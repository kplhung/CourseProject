        <p>Re ''Nader, Nominated by the Greens, Attacks Politics as Usual'' (news article, June 26):</p>
        <p>If Ralph Nader and Patrick J. Buchanan, the probable Reform Party nominee, want to get into the presidential debates with the major party candidates, they should start by agreeing to debate each other. By scheduling a series of NaderBuchanan debates in the days leading up to the first Bush-Gore debate, they could attract considerably more attention to their candidacies than either could on his own.</p>

        <p>If Ralph Nader and Patrick J.

By scheduling a series of NaderBuchanan debates in the days leading up to the first Bush-Gore debate, they could attract considerably more attention to their candidacies than either could on his own.</p>
        <p>Then, if the voters, after watching these debates, find Mr. Nader and Mr. Buchanan credible and attractive candidates, the candidates' poll numbers would rise and the Presidential Debate Commission would face even greater pressure to allow them to take part in the Bush-Gore debates.</p>
