        <p>The House passed a bill tonight offering prescription drug benefits to 39 million elderly and disabled people on Medicare, but only after a day of pitched battle, in which frustrated Democrats walked off the House floor at one point.</p>
        <p>The bill was passed by a vote of 217 to 214, with 5 Democrats voting for the measure and 10 Republicans voting against it. But the bill, which would expand Medicare more than any other measure passed in the 35-year history of the program by offering coverage for drug costs to all beneficiaries, now goes to the Senate, where its fate is uncertain.</p>
        <p>The House vote came at the end of a day of high drama and political high jinks as each party tried to outdo the other in proving its zealous commitment to the elderly.</p>
        <p>Even as they championed a major extension of Medicare coverage, Republicans found themselves on the defensive throughout the day.</p>
        <p>Criticizing the Republican bill as a sham, a hoax, bad medicine and a risky scheme that would ''privatize'' Medicare, the Democratic minority  used a variety of parliamentary and procedural tactics to delay the work of the House. The Democrats also expressed their frustration at being unable to get a full debate on their proposal to establish much more extensive drug coverage.</p>
        <p>Republicans shot back that the Democrats were throwing temper tantrums and were engaged in political grandstanding, stunts and shenanigans to scare the elderly and win votes in this fall's elections.</p>
        <p>Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois said, ''Democrats are standing in the way of progress.'' President Clinton threatened to veto the House Republican bill, which he denounced as an empty promise.</p>
        <p>''It puts special interests above the public interest,'' Mr. Clinton said after the House voted.</p>
        <p>Under the Republican bill, the government would pay subsidies to insurance companies to encourage them to offer a product that does not now exist: insurance policies covering drug costs of the elderly and disabled. The policies would not cover any other medical expenses.</p>
        <p>Democrats strongly support Medicare drug benefits, but want a larger role for the government and a smaller role for the insurance industry. Under the Democratic bill, premiums and benefits would be the same for virtually all beneficiaries in all parts of the country. Under the Republican plan, the government would describe a model or standard policy, but premiums, benefits and copayments could vary from one private drug plan to another, so long as the overall value was equivalent to that of the model policy.</p>
        <p>The Democratic plan appears to be more generous than the Republicans' standard policy. Monthly premiums would be $25, compared with $37, there would be no deductible and the beneficiary's maximum out-of-pocket costs would be $4,000 a year, compared with $6,000.</p>
        <p>Under current law, Medicare generally does not cover drug costs for people outside the hospital. One-third of Medicare beneficiaries have no insurance to help pay such costs.</p>
        <p>Republicans won a majority of the elderly vote in elections for the House two years ago, and Democrats see the prescription drug issue as an opportunity to regain their advantage with the elderly, and their majority in the House.</p>
        <p>Representative Robert Wexler, Democrat of Florida, criticized the Republican measure, saying: ''This bill does not provide prescription drug coverage to senior citizens. It provides political cover for Republicans.''</p>
        <p>The Senate last week rejected the Democratic approach to Medicare drug benefits when it came up suddenly and unexpectedly on the floor. The Senate Finance Committee is working on drug legislation and may vote on it soon.</p>
        <p>At a meeting of the House Rules Committee at 2:30 a.m. today, Republicans set highly restrictive rules for today's floor debate. The rules were narrowly approved in the full House on a largely party-line vote of 216 to 213.</p>
        <p>The rules allowed the Democrats only 10 minutes at the end of the day to propose an alternative to the House Republican bill. Democrats wanted to offer a measure costing $100 billion over five years, but House Republican leaders insisted that the Democrats could not offer anything costing more than $40 billion, the cost of the Republican bill.</p>
        <p>To show their displeasure, Democrats forced the House to take nine roll-call votes before it even began debating the substance of the Republican bill.</p>
        <p>Just before final passage of the Republican bill, the House tonight rejected a scaled-down version of President Clinton's plan to offer drug benefits through Medicare. The vote on the measure, which came in under the $40 billion limit set in the rules, was 222 to 204.</p>
        <p>Of the day's political infighting, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, said, ''The Democrats have been planning this circus for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Representative Deborah Pryce, Republican of Ohio, said: ''The Democrats are throwing a temper tantrum to divert attention from the merits of our bill. In walking out of the House today, they walked out on America's seniors.''</p>
        <p>After marching out, Democrats held a news conference on the east steps of the Capitol, then returned to the House floor a half-hour later.</p>
        <p>The AARP, formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons, did not endorse or oppose either bill.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Congress, Horace B. Deets, the group's executive director, said, ''We are pleased that both the House Republican and Democratic bills include a voluntary prescription drug benefit in Medicare -- a benefit to which every Medicare beneficiary is entitled.'' But Mr. Deets expressed concern that ''many beneficiaries may elect not to participate'' in the Republican plan. People with low drug costs may not view it as a ''good buy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The National Senior Citizens Law Center, which represents many Medicare recipients, opposed the House Republican bill, saying subsidies would be ''grossly inadequate'' for many of the elderly.</p>
        <p>Under the House Republican plan, a widow with income of $13,000 a year and drug expenses of $4,800 a year would have to spend nearly one-third of her income on drugs and insurance if she bought the standard coverage. She would have to pay $4,194, or 87 percent of her drug costs, out of her own pocket.</p>
        <p>In this example, the widow would pay $37 a month, or $444 a year, in premiums, plus the $250 deductible and half of the next $2,100 in drug expenses ($1,050). The insurance policy would pay the other half. The beneficiary would have to pay the remainder of her drug expenses, $2,450.</p>
        <p>Republicans said their bill was superior to the Democrats' because it would let elderly people buy policies tailored to their needs.</p>
        <p>But Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said, ''Instead of making prescriptions more affordable for all seniors, the Republican bill hands a huge subsidy to the insurance industry. Republicans are forcing seniors to deal with private insurance companies, which have said they will not offer prescription coverage.''</p>
        <p>Democrats repeatedly quoted Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, who has said his members are not interested in selling drug insurance of the type envisioned in the House Republican bill.</p>
        <p>Democrats who voted for the bill on final passage were Representatives Ralph M. Hall of Texas, Jim Maloney of Connecticut, Matthew G. Martinez of California, Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota and James A. Traficant Jr. of Ohio.</p>
        <p>The 10 Republicans who voted against the bill were Representatives Helen Chenoweth-Hage of Idaho, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Greg Ganske of Iowa, John Hostettler of Indiana, Ernest Istook of Oklahoma, Constance A. Morella of Maryland, Ron Paul of Texas, Mark Sanford of South Carolina, Bob Schaffer of Colorado and Nick Smith of Michigan.</p>
