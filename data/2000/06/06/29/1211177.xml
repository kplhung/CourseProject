        <p>Lee Long spent the evening of his 34th birthday, in June 1994, on a date with his new girlfriend, munching on Kentucky Fried Chicken at her place in Brooklyn, catching part of an episode of ''N.Y.P.D. Blue'' and, after riding the train home to Jackson Heights, Queens, stopping at the corner store for some strawberry ice cream.</p>
        <p>Mr. Long spent his next six birthdays in prison for crimes -- rape, robbery and sexual abuse -- he did not commit. It was sheer twist of circumstance -- the route he walked from the subway station, the stops he made in the subway station for a pack of tokens and at the store for the pint of ice cream -- that put Mr. Long in the view of police officers who were looking for a suspect in a rape and robbery that had occurred in the neighborhood shortly before he got off the train.</p>
        <p>Based on a description that was broadcast over the police radio, an officer picked up Mr. Long on the street as he neared home. He was later identified by the victim, who said she was sure, when she saw his boots, that it was Mr. Long who had attacked her and stolen her jewelry. He was arrested, convicted and sentenced to 8 to 24 years in prison.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Long, 40, was set free after serving six years, and after his lawyers, from Legal Aid, persuaded prosecutors to reinvestigate the case. New evidence was uncovered that lent credibility to Mr. Long's alibi that he was either in Brooklyn or on his way to Queens at the time of the attack in Queens.</p>
        <p>In reversing Mr. Long's conviction, Justice Joseph G. Golia of State Supreme Court in Queens said, ''The wrong man was convicted.''</p>
        <p>As Judge Golia read to the end of his decision, the man who came into the courtroom wearing handcuffs was free to go, and he put his hands under his eyes, seeming to fight back tears, before turning to his lawyers and prosecutors to thank them and moving slowly out of the courtroom.</p>
        <p>Speaking briefly with reporters outside the courthouse, Mr. Long described his ordeal as a nightmare and said that ''God and faith'' were the only things that got him through. He was then escorted into a district attorney's car and taken to a cousin's house.</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers and prosecutors said that a piece of evidence that would have given Mr. Long a solid alibi had been overlooked in the trial: a police officer, who was new on the force at the time, called Mr. Long's girlfriend, Yvette McCormick, after he was taken into custody. She told the officer that Mr. Long had been with her in Brooklyn and then on the train home when the rape occurred.</p>
        <p>The rape occurred between 10:45 p.m. and 11:15 p.m., according to court records. Ms. McCormick and Mr. Long testified that he left Brooklyn about 10:30 for the train ride, which lasted more than an hour. But the prosecution persuaded the jury that Ms. McCormick was only trying to save Mr. Long from prison.</p>
        <p>It was not until the investigation was reopened that the authorities uncovered the timing of the initial conversation with Ms. McCormick: before Mr. Long could have contacted her and concocted an alibi.</p>
        <p>It did not help Mr. Long's case that his arrest in the rape and robbery was not his first brush with the law. Since moving to New York City from Birmingham, Ala., when he was 26, Mr. Long had served two 30-day jail sentences, one for petty larceny and the other for assault in the third degree, and had a drug problem. But at the time of his arrest, he was attending a methadone clinic for the drug problem and was caring for a sick uncle.</p>
        <p>Questions also arose in the new investigation about the victim's identification of Mr. Long, which was based mostly on clothing and the boots, which she later said she only ''felt,'' and did not see. There was no DNA testing because investigators found no evidence of hair, semen or blood that they could test. Defense lawyers and prosecutors also gave separate lie detector tests to Mr. Long, which he passed, according to court records.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Long was released yesterday, Seymour James, the lawyer in charge of the criminal defense division of the Queens Legal Aid office, which represented him, said: ''It's a wonderful feeling to see a person released who we know is not guilty. It's what we work for all the time.''</p>
