        <p>In a raucous news conference on a sprawling Silicon Valley corporate campus affectionately called Larryland by its inhabitants, Lawrence J. Ellison, the chairman and founder of the Oracle Corporation, today defended his company's yearlong spying operation against Microsoft as a ''civic duty'' similar to investigative reporting by the press.</p>
        <p>''All we did was to try to take information that was hidden and bring it into the light,'' Mr. Ellison said. ''I don't think that's arrogance. That's a public service.''</p>

        <p>In a raucous news conference on a sprawling Silicon Valley corporate campus affectionately called Larryland by its inhabitants, Lawrence J. Ellison, the chairman and founder of the Oracle Corporation, today defended his company's yearlong spying operation against Microsoft as a ''civic duty'' similar to investigative reporting by the press.</p>
        <p>''All we did was to try to take information that was hidden and bring it into the light,'' Mr. Ellison said. ''I don't think that's arrogance. That's a public service.''</p>
        <p>His remarks came a day after Oracle acknowledged hiring a detective agency in Washington, D.C., to document ties between Microsoft and three advocacy groups.</p>
        <p>The news conference, at the end of a previously scheduled product announcement, was characterized by Mr. Ellison's determined defense of his business ethics and of his company's behavior as an appropriate method for combating Microsoft's business tactics.</p>
        <p>The hourlong session took on a surreal quality as questions about whether Mr. Ellison's behavior was ''Nixonian'' were interspersed with inquiries about Oracle's products and the company's market share in the Internet software business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellison repeatedly asserted that the spying operation was justified by Microsoft's own business practices, which recently led the federal judge who heard the antitrust case against the company, Thomas Penfield Jackson, to rule that Microsoft should be broken in two.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if we're alone in this,'' Mr. Ellison said. ''The Justice Department felt the need to investigate this company, too.''</p>
        <p>The 55-year-old software entrepreneur, whose wealth has come close in recent months to rivaling that of William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, said his company had done nothing wrong in commissioning the investigation, which came to light this month after the detective agency was linked to a failed attempt to buy the trash of the Association for Competitive Technology, a Microsoft ally.</p>
        <p>Two other groups backing Microsoft in the antitrust case, the Independent Institute and the National Taxpayers Union, were also targets of the Oracle investigation, which began last June. Documents showing Microsoft's financial support for those groups were later cited in articles in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.</p>
        <p>In acknowledging on Tuesday that it had paid for the investigation, Oracle declared, ''Left undisclosed, these Microsoft front groups could have improperly influenced one of the most important antitrust cases in U.S. history.''</p>
        <p>Today, though saying that he would take complete responsibility for the effort, Mr. Ellison said he had not known until Tuesday about the tactics involved or even the name of the detective agency. The agency, Investigative Group International, is headed by Terry Lenzner, a former Watergate investigator who has also worked for President Clinton's lawyers and the tobacco industry.</p>
        <p>''I really didn't spend a lot of my time planning the investigation,'' Mr. Ellison said. ''We have a group in Washington that looked after that. Believe it or not, I spend most of my time worrying about our E-business suite, our applications server and our database server.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellison, who has long deflected controversy with combative humor, insisted that he had nothing to hide. And he challenged Microsoft to undertake its own investigation of Oracle.</p>
        <p>''We will ship them our garbage,'' he said. ''We will ship our garbage to Redmond, and they can go through it. We believe in full disclosure.''</p>
        <p>Officials at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Wash., were quick to rise to the bait.</p>
        <p>''The only thing more disturbing than Oracle's behavior is their ongoing attempt to justify these actions,'' Microsoft said in a statement. ''Mr. Ellison now appears to acknowledge that he was personally aware of and personally authorized the broad overall strategy of a covert operation against a variety of trade associations.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, in a pot-and-kettle tit-for-tat, Microsoft noted that Oracle had financed its own share of lobbying groups, including ProComp, the Progress and Freedom Foundation, the Software and Information Industry Association and the Computer and Communications Industry Association -- all of which have taken stands against Microsoft.</p>
        <p>A spokesman said Microsoft's top executives, including Mr. Gates and Steven A. Ballmer, were in an all-day executive retreat and were unavailable for comment.</p>
        <p>The verbal fencing between Oracle and Microsoft is likely only to sharpen as they compete with increasingly parallel industry strategies.</p>
        <p>Last week Microsoft introduced its vision of Internet-based computing that it called its Microsoft.NET strategy. Mr. Gates said it would take years for all the products in the strategy to reach the marketplace.</p>
        <p>Oracle executives responded today by saying that their company already had a complete line of software for Web-based computing. Both Mr. Ellison and his chief marketing executive, Gary L. Bloom, said Microsoft's strategy should actually be called Microsoft.NOT, as in ''not yet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellison said he did not communicate frequently with either Mr. Gates or Mr. Ballmer. Indeed, he showed a particular dislike for the two Microsoft executives and the company they have built into the world's largest independent software developer.</p>
        <p>''They're special,'' he said. ''They're the only ones we've felt the need to investigate. They're the only ones who destroyed the most innovative company in Silicon Valley in the last decade -- Netscape.''</p>
