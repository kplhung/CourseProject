        <p>Most of his fellow draftees were pressing their shirts and nervously waiting for their dry-cleaned suits to arrive at the hotel. Darius Miles spent the anxious hours before tonight's National Basketball Association draft like most teenagers.</p>
        <p>''I played Super Mario Brothers with my best friend,'' Miles said. ''Video games, movies. Anything to kill the time.''</p>
        <p>Kids, they're so impatient. Miles had to wait only 18 years and 8 months to become the highest-drafted high school player. Taken third by the Los Angeles Clippers before a few thousand stunned fans at the Target Center, Miles stole the attention and thunder from many of the other well-known prospects.</p>
        <p>As expected, the Cincinnati power forward Kenyon Martin went No. 1 to the Nets, and the Vancouver Grizzlies plucked Stromile Swift out of Louisiana State as the second pick.</p>
        <p>The Bulls chose Marcus Fizer of Iowa State, the power forward who was thought to be going to the Clippers with the third pick, at No. 4. Florida's Mike Miller went No. 5 to the Orlando Magic.</p>
        <p>The most intriguing development of the night involved the Magic, which dumped two of its lottery picks -- Nos. 10 and 13 -- and two of its players to create salary cap room for the beginning of the free-agent signing period that begins July 1. Tim Duncan and Grant Hill may be pipe dreams no longer.</p>
        <p>Keyon Dooling, the No. 10 pick, was sent to the Clippers along with Derek Strong and Corey Maggette for a future first-round pick. And the rights to the Magic's pick at No. 13, Courtney Alexander, the nation's leading scorer out of Fresno State, were dealt to Dallas for a future first-round pick.</p>
        <p>The draft again had a young flavor. After Martin, 10 straight underclassmen were taken. DeShawn Stevenson became the 11th player in the last five years to go straight from high school to the N.B.A. when the Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.) senior was selected 23rd by the Utah Jazz.</p>
        <p>The selection of St. John's Erick Barkley at No. 28 by the Portland Trail Blazers broke the record for underclassmen selected in the first round of the draft. Eighteen were picked, breaking the mark of 17 set in the 1996 draft.</p>
        <p>In addition, a record seven players born outside the United States were drafted in the first round.</p>
        <p>Kevin Garnett had been the highest-selected prep player when he was taken fifth in 1995, but the 6-foot-9-inch, 217-pound, wafer-thin Miles surpassed his idol, who plays for the hometown Timberwolves. Walking to the podium with a radiant smile, Miles wore an oversized gray suit and a gold hoop earring. He was so excited about the selection, he hugged Commissioner David Stern and patted the commissioner's graying thatch.</p>
        <p>''Maybe if I have a couple of good years, you guys will say that's the greatest high school player ever to get picked,'' said Miles, from East St. Louis (Ill.) High, who became the 14th player in the modern era to go straight to the N.B.A. from high school. He is the 10th high school player since Garnett to be drafted in the first round.</p>
        <p>Martin's entrance was almost as electrifying. The highlight tape rolled before he strode toward the podium in a Nets baseball cap. Ducking inside for strong layups, rejecting shots or taking alley-oop passes and throwing them down maliciously, he looked great on celluloid.</p>
        <p>With Martin unable to work out for teams because he broke his leg three months ago during the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, video was all the Nets had to go on.</p>
        <p>''Kenyon was the best player in the draft,'' Miles said. ''He worked hard for four years in college. I'm just a high school guy.''</p>
        <p>A teary-eyed Martin said: ''These last three months have been outrageous for me -- knee rehabbing and all that stuff. It's been unreal. When they called my name it was like a sigh of relief. I worked so hard for four years, and now I guess it's panning out for me. I can't stop now. I have to get better from here and just move on.''</p>
        <p>Martin, the consensus player of the year, became the third senior chosen No. 1 over all in the past four years and the first player from Cincinnati to be taken with the first pick. Oscar Robertson was a territorial choice of the Cincinnati Royals in 1960, and thus was not eligible to be selected by any other team.</p>
        <p>Miles talked of how much a fan he was of Garnett and Chris Webber, his two favorite players.</p>
        <p>''I look at K.G. a little more because he was in the same situation as me, and he went through the same things,'' Miles said. ''He's a great man and a great player. Hopefully, I can be a lot like him.''</p>
        <p>He also did not say anything disparaging about the Clippers, the losing franchise that has jaded some of the brightest and youngest N.B.A. stars over the past two decades. ''I think the Clippers are a good, young team,'' he said. ''I feel we can develop as the years go on, and hopefully we'll be a playoff team.''</p>
        <p>If Miles beaming or Martin crying in the green room did not qualify as the draft's most touching moments, then Mateen Cleaves's going to Detroit as the 14th pick a few months after he led Michigan State to the national title did.</p>
        <p>Cleaves, a 6-2 guard, joined Morris Peterson, taken 21st by Toronto, as the second group of teammates to be selected in the first round after Martin and DerMarr Johnson, who was taken No. 6 by the Atlanta Hawks. ''I had to pinch myself when we won it all, and I have to pinch myself now,'' Cleaves said. ''Seems like a fairy tale, me going home to Detroit. I'm going to have to place a call to Grant and tell him to stay. I'd be honored to be his teammate.''</p>
        <p>Chris Mihm, the 7-foot Texas center, was taken seventh by the Bulls, and the Michigan freshman Jamal Crawford was selected eighth by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Shortly afterward, the two teams swapped picks. The Bulls traded the rights to Mihm and an undisclosed amount of cash for Crawford.</p>
        <p>With the ninth pick, the Houston Rockets selected Minnesota center Joel Przybilla. The Gopher sophomore, who quit school amid the university's academic scandal, received a chorus of boos before he took the podium to meet Stern. He was later traded to Milwaukee for rights to Jason Collier, the Bucks' No. 15 pick, plus a future first-round selection.</p>
        <p>Speedy Claxton of Hofstra was taken No. 20 by the 76ers. The 5-11 point guard wowed scouts at the predraft camps, including his breathtaking two-handed dunk in Chicago last month that stunned the gathering of general managers and coaches.</p>
