        <p>I HAVE never been one to flirt with the pleasures of self-denial. If I gave up something, it was usually someone else's idea. Saying goodbye to a favorite doll whose chemically treated, artificial hair gave me a rash was my mother's idea. Come to think of it, that woman also masterminded the campaigns to purge chocolate, nail biting and no-handed wheelies from my life.</p>
        <p>But I made my own decision to bid farewell to eBay a few months ago. Maybe it was because I caught myself cutting back on groceries to pay for things like corn-shaped salt and pepper shakers. Or maybe it was because I realized that the (other) bidders resembled characters in a Joseph Heller novel, obsessed shoppers doomed to sell the same Hummel figurines and Squealer beanie babies to one another for the rest of their lives. If you think about it, how many Seals and Crofts songbooks could have been printed in the first place?</p>

        <p>I HAVE never been one to flirt with the pleasures of self-denial. If I gave up something, it was usually someone else's idea. Saying goodbye to a favorite doll whose chemically treated, artificial hair gave me a rash was my mother's idea. Come to think of it, that woman also masterminded the campaigns to purge chocolate, nail biting and no-handed wheelies from my life.</p>
        <p>But I made my own decision to bid farewell to eBay a few months ago. Maybe it was because I caught myself cutting back on groceries to pay for things like corn-shaped salt and pepper shakers. Or maybe it was because I realized that the (other) bidders resembled characters in a Joseph Heller novel, obsessed shoppers doomed to sell the same Hummel figurines and Squealer beanie babies to one another for the rest of their lives. If you think about it, how many Seals and Crofts songbooks could have been printed in the first place?</p>
        <p>So when bad publicity hit eBay, the online auction house, last spring and forced it to suspend the sale of a painting whose price may have been inflated by shill bidding, I knew that I was clean. I felt smug knowing I would never again bid, and never again have to wait 20 minutes in a post office line to purchase a $21.17 money order to pay for Fire King dinner plates.</p>
        <p>I have no theories about why certain people have addictive personalities or what sets them off. But if you do, I would like to hear them because last week I broke my vows. Well, partly. Although it may be true that I (1) bid on eBay and (2) bought Fire King dinner plates, I would like to point out that I did not (3) stand in line at the post office to get a money order.</p>
        <p>Instead, I paid for my fix instantly, using a new online payment system called PayPal, a free service from X.com. It enabled me to send a $26 credit card payment via e-mail to the seller. (For sellers who do not have an account, PayPal opens one for them and deposits the money. Then the sellers visit PayPal.com to complete a simple registration process.)</p>
        <p>That same day the plate seller informed me that my order was in the mail. There would be no weeklong delay waiting for a check to clear or for a money order to navigate the postal system.</p>
        <p>The beauty is that you can send money -- real money, not one of those gimmicky Internet currencies that can be spent only at a few partners' sites -- to anyone with an e-mail address. You pay either by credit card or from a bank account, which you register when you open an account. The payment is credited to the seller's account, and the seller can leave it there or withdraw it by requesting either a check or bank transfer. PayPal is especially popular for online auction purchases but is equally useful for other payments. My husband, for instance, used PayPal to send $15 for a shareware program directly to the author.</p>
        <p>In some ways, PayPal resembles an electronic wallet because it stores personal data to enable you to buy things without revealing private information to merchants. But unlike wallets that accompany you online, your PayPal account information is stored on the company's servers. To make payments, you must visit the Web site.</p>
        <p>PayPal's success in opening more than two million accounts since it  opened last year has emboldened a growing number of online payment competitors, including PayPlace.com, payMe.com and eBay's own Billpoint.</p>
        <p>''But there is really nothing else like Paypal because it's incredibly easy and has removed a lot of barriers to making online payments,'' said Avivah Litan, research director for payment systems at the Gartner Group, a research firm.</p>
        <p>Of course, for impulse bidders like me, those advantages are also flaws. Have I mentioned that I was so inspired that I also bid on six yards of vintage fabric for kitchen curtains ($27, via PayPal), an egg cup (outbid, luckily), a patterned tablecloth (ditto) and a little vase (pending)?</p>
        <p>To distract myself from the lure of two Kraft Kiddie Kup Swanky Swig glasses, I phoned Vince Sollitto, an X.com spokesman, to complain that it was PayPal's fault that I was spending so much. Mr. Sollitto was unmoved. ''That's not a bad thing in our business,'' he pointed out.</p>
        <p>In fact, my bad habits are at the heart of his business. The more payments I make, the more money Paypal earns. Paypal, which doesn't pay interest on the accounts, makes money by investing the account balances.</p>
        <p>That brings me to another shortcoming: PayPal earns more interest the longer the money is left in the accounts, so the company would love it if buyers and sellers would make their transactions from one PayPal account to another. But if an account holder requests a withdrawal, it can take up to 48 hours for an electronic bank transfer to be made and a week or for a paper check to be received.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sollitto said the delays were inevitable. ''When you request a paper check, the bulk of the delay is Uncle Sam,'' he said, invoking the check-is-in-the-mail defense. One eBay seller I queried via e-mail last week -- O.K., I bid on his plates, which I am happy to say went to someone else -- told me that he does not accept PayPal payments because it takes too long to get the money out of an account.</p>
        <p>But the biggest drawback to PayPal is that you have no protection if you pay a fraudulent seller. Unlike credit card companies, who limit liability to $50, PayPal will not help you get your money back.</p>
        <p>''Our whole goal and job is to help you make payments quickly,'' Mr. Sollitto said. ''It's the same as if you would write a check and mail it.''</p>
        <p>So don't go crazy and authorize a $2,000 credit card payment, the maximum that PayPal allows in a six-month period, to someone you don't know. You'll limit your risk by using PayPal to make smaller payments;  one cent is the minimum amount.</p>
        <p>I wish I could say that was the sale price of the three juice glasses with oranges painted on them that I bought on eBay. But even at $9.99, I can still afford (some) groceries.</p>
