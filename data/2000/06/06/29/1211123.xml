        <p>If anyone needs further proof that compact disc technology is becoming as commonplace as old magnetic tape found in audio and video cassettes, look to Sony's newest Mavica digital still camera.</p>
        <p>Its high-resolution pictures (2.1 megapixels) are not stored on conventional flash memory cards, nor on 3.5-inch floppy disks like previous models or even on Sony's own MemorySticks. Instead, the Mavica MVC-CD1000 carries a CD recorder that stores up to 160 snapshots on a recordable 3.5-inch CD.</p>
        <p>Sony executives said the $1,300 camera, expected to be available in the United States in August, was the first of its kind.</p>
        <p>Americans are believed to use as many as 260 million CD or CD-R drives on their personal computers, Sony estimates. By placing pictures directly on small high-capacity CD-R's, consumers can place the discs (about a third of the size of full-size CD's) in conventional CD-ROM and CD-R drives and view their pictures.</p>
        <p>The CD-R's can store up to 156 megabytes of digital information, compared with a floppy disk that stores up to 1.44 megabytes and MemorySticks that have a current capacity of 64 megabytes. Perhaps the biggest benefit, Sony spokesmen said, is that the special CD-R's are relatively inexpensive, costing about $4 per disc.</p>
        <p>Storing pictures in the camera on a CD-R shortens recording time in the Mavica, making it possible to shoot more images more rapidly than models using other storage mediums, according to Sony specifications on the camera.</p>
        <p>Like earlier Mavicas, the MVC-CD1000 includes optical zoom and a digital image stabilization that eliminates unwanted shakes.</p>
