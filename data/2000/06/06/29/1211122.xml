        <p>TAMEEKA MITCHEM remembers her first foray into journalism as something of a disaster. In April 1999, she volunteered to work for Harlem Live, a nonprofit Web site (www.harlemlive.org) produced by New York teenagers. When another reporter could not make a scheduled interview at a local community organization, Tameeka went instead.</p>
        <p>''I was so nervous, and that's weird because I'm not a nervous person,'' she said. ''I was reading the information in the cab on the way over. I think I asked one question three times.''</p>
        <p>Six months later, Tameeka was Harlem Live's editor in chief, helping to manage the Web site's staff of more than 30. The site, created in the mid-90's, publishes news and features concerning Harlem, mostly on community-based organizations that, she said, ''don't get all that much attention.''</p>
        <p>Tameeka was not interested in being a reporter or an editor when she joined Harlem Live. ''I was looking for something to put on my college application,'' she said.</p>
        <p>It worked. In a few months, she will leave the site to attend college in Virginia. Her major: journalism.</p>
