        <p>In a pointed reminder of how far Nassau County is from recovery, the county's bond rating was downgraded again today, even as the state's bailout of the county began in earnest with the first meeting of its newly appointed fiscal oversight board.</p>
        <p>Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, downgraded the county's bond rating to BBB-, the last level above junk status.</p>
        <p>It could have been worse: the agency had threatened to downgrade Nassau's bonds to junk -- or noninvestment grade -- by June 30 if the county failed to show fiscal responsibility. Analysts at the agency said that Nassau was spared junk bond status only through the extraordinary intervention of the state, which offered the cash-starved county a $100 million bailout plan and created an oversight board to monitor its finances.</p>
        <p>But the downgrade was nonetheless a remarkable rebuke, coming as it did even after the state intervention spurred Nassau's oft-divided leadership to agree earlier this month to enact $52 million in budget cuts and new revenues. And it served to highlight the seriousness of the problems that the county faces as its new fiscal oversight board met here this afternoon to begin its work.</p>
        <p>Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the board, which is called the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, said that he understood Standard &amp; Poor's decision to downgrade the county.</p>
        <p>''They have a set of data, they have their models, and frankly, had it not been for the formation of this august panel here, it would have turned to junk,'' he said after the board met. ''And that would have been a pity, because the people of Nassau County would have had to pay for that.''</p>
        <p>One other rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, downgraded Nassau to the last level above junk status in February. But Standard &amp; Poor's had kept the county two notches above junk, and county officials had hoped that the state's intervention and their recent budget cuts would stave off further downgrades.</p>
        <p>But Standard &amp; Poor's explained in a statement that it decided to downgrade the county because of its ''weak current financial position and ongoing fiscal and operating challenges,'' and noted that it was the state's actions that kept the bonds above junk.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the state bailout, the county must find $50 million in budget cuts and new revenues this year and $70 million in each of the next three years. If the county fails to keep its part of the bargain, the oversight board will become a control board with the power to make budget decisions. But county officials and board members alike said that they hoped it did not come to that.</p>
        <p>Today, the board approved $52 million in budget cuts and new revenues that the county agreed to on June 12, clearing the way for the state to begin providing aid.</p>
        <p>But the county cannot afford to coast on the strength of this one, small victory for long: Mr. Zarb said today that he wanted the county to come up with its 2001 budget -- which must include $70 million in new cuts and new revenues -- by Labor Day, along with a four-year plan of how the county plans to become solvent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zarb, the chairman of the group that runs the Nasdaq stock exchange, was appointed to the oversight board by Gov. George E. Pataki, along with Richard M. Kessel, the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority; Robert G. Smith, a member of the New York City Financial Control Board: and Ronald A. Stack, the head of the public finance department of Lehman Brothers.</p>
        <p>The Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, named Robert Wallach, the chairman of a financial services holding company on Long Island. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, named David H. Peirez, a lawyer, and State Comptroller H. Carl McCall appointed Martin D. Payson, a former vice chairman of Time Warner Inc.</p>
