        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We take issue with your report that France is pressing Poland to show greater support for European defense if Warsaw wants to keep its prospects alive for joining the European Union (''Poland Is Pressed to Choose Between Europe and U.S.,'' news article, June 4).</p>
        <p>President Jacques Chirac never asked Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek whether Poland wished to be part of Europe or ''the 51st state'' of the United States. The meeting referred to in the article at which Mr. Chirac reportedly made this comment never took place.</p>

        <p>Poland's candidacy for membership in the European Union has been accepted by all member countries, and France strongly supports it. In joining the European Union, Poland will bring its political support and valuable military contribution to the European Union's common security and defense policy.</p>
        <p>Does this mean it will be less of a NATO ally than it is today? Of course not. Nobody in Europe believes that the commitment to European security and defense policy contradicts the commitment to NATO.</p>
        <p>FRANCOIS DELATTRE  JAROSLAW KUREK  Washington, June 27, 2000</p>
        <p>The writers are spokesmen for, respectively, the embassies of France and Poland.</p>
