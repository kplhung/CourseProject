      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A boxing promoter testifying in the federal racketeering and bribery trial of the president and founder of the International Boxing Federation said today that he had paid another I.B.F. official a $100,000 bribe to force a rematch of a 1995 heavyweight fight between George Foreman and Axel Schulz.</p>
        <p>The first bout between Foreman, then the I.B.F. heavyweight champion, and Schulz, a German fighter, had ended in a controversial decision for Foreman that was booed and ridiculed by many in the Las Vegas audience who believed Schulz had won.</p>
        <p>Cedric Kushner, one of the promoters of the fight for Schulz, told the jury today that less than two months after the fight he had pressed the I.B.F.'s president, Robert W. Lee Sr., and the organization's executive committee to order a quick rematch after such a close and controversial decision.</p>
        <p>Kushner said that after he had made his appeal at the I.B.F.'s annual convention, the sanctioning body's rankings chairman, Colin Douglas Beavers, came to him with a proposition that he said came from Lee, whom Beavers called ''the boss.''</p>
        <p>''He said he could ensure or secure the response on the rematch that I was looking for for $100,000,'' Kushner said under questioning by Assistant United States Attorney Jose Sierra.</p>
        <p>''I used some foul language and suggested that he was crazy,'' Kushner said. ''He said, 'You know how the game is played and I will have to tell the boss.' I was truly outraged because it seemed like such an absurd amount of money, since I remember Lee telling me at ringside at the fight that he thought Schulz got robbed.''</p>
        <p>Kushner testified on Monday that he had paid other bribes between 1987 and 1994 to Beavers for what he believed were favorable rankings for his fighters.</p>
        <p>At Beavers's suggestion, Kushner said, he broached the subject of the $100,000 payment with Wilfred Sauerland, a wealthy German businessman who was also a promoter. Kushner said he and I.B.F. officials had known that Sauerland was under pressure from German television and boxing officials to get a rematch, since the first Foreman-Schulz bout had attracted 30 million television viewers on HBO alone.</p>
        <p>Sauerland agreed to provide the money, Kushner said, and the I.B.F. issued a letter on June 6, 1995, publicly directing Foreman to fight Schulz again. Kushner said that Sauerland arrived from Europe two weeks later with the cash payment, which Kushner said Beavers then collected at Kushner's home in East Hampton, N.Y. But Foreman subsequently relinquished his I.B.F. title rather than fight Schulz again. Asked by Sierra if he attempted to get back the $100,000, Kushner said no. ''I didn't think in this kind of business that there were refunds,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lee and his son, Robert Lee Jr., are charged with 39 counts of racketeering, bribery and tax evasion; they are accused of extorting $338,000 from boxers and their managers.</p>
        <p>Like other promoters who have testified, Kushner said he never paid money directly to Lee and talked only in veiled, indirect terms with Lee about the payments. Like many others who testified during the 10 weeks of trial so far, he painted a sordid picture of the boxing business, in which there were no loyalties and little honor.</p>
        <p>Kushner portrayed his fellow promoter Don King as someone who had attempted to steal boxers away from him. Several times he derisively referred to Robert Arum, the powerful owner of Top Rank Inc., as someone who never negotiated in good faith.</p>
        <p>In testimony earlier this week, Kushner, a South African native, said he had paid bribes to Beavers to get the I.B.F. to lift its ban on boxers from South Africa. He also said that no matter what he paid to the group, he knew he was ''second fiddle'' to King, who he said was favored by the I.B.F.</p>
