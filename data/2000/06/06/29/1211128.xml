        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Without question, politics is a big factor in missile defense debates (front page, June 23). One aspect that wasn't mentioned is budget politics, which has slowed the rush to deploy national missile defenses.</p>
        <p>In 1996, Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich introduced the Defend America Act, which would have required rapid deployment of national missile defenses. Even with this push from the two senior Republicans in Congress, the bill never came up for a vote. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that its proposed system would cost $60 billion, which was too much for a majority of legislators in both parties.</p>

        <p>With the budget running a surplus, cost is a lesser factor in the current debate. But whether the public would rather spend the surplus on missile defenses than on education, health care or other priorities is far from clear.</p>
