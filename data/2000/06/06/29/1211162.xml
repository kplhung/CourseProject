        <p>GERMANY: KOHL FILES MISSING -- Most of the computer files in the Chancellery of the former leader, Helmut Kohl, were destroyed after his election defeat in 1998. Buckhard Hirsch, who has led a parliamentary inquiry into financial wrongdoings by Mr. Kohl, told Parliament that two-thirds of the files were deleted. All files linked to the 1992 sale of an east German oil refinery to Elf Aquitaine of France are missing, Mr. Hirsch said. Prosecutors in Germany, France and Switzerland are investigating the payments of tens of millions of dollars in kickbacks on this sale.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: DOG BREEDING BAN -- Politicians agreed on a nationwide ban on the breeding of so-called attack dogs after huge public protests set off by the fatal mauling of a 6-year-old boy in Hamburg. A statement said the ban would apply to pit bulls, Staffordshire bull terriers and bull terriers, ''as well as other individual dog breeds and cross-breeds deemed dangerous.'' The German railways announced a ban on allowing fighting breeds on its trains and in railway stations.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: OFFICIAL APOLOGIZES -- After drawing wide criticism when she was quoted as saying Queen Elizabeth II should vacate her palaces, Mo Mowlam, the cabinet office minister, apologized and said the comments were merely confirmation of something she said six years ago. ''I apologize if I have caused any upset, but it was six years ago,'' Ms. Mowlam told Sky Television. ''It was not anti-monarchist. It was an attempt to ask, in the 21st century, what about a modern palace?''</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: PRINCELY WARNING -- Britain's media watchdog warned that Prince William, 18, has a right to some privacy even after he leaves high school this week. ''Now he is leaving school it is certainly not a free-for-all,'' said Lord Wakeham, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission. Among other things, the news media should be sure its articles are accurate, he said, and should not harass the prince.</p>

        <p>VATICAN: MOBSTER'S CONFESSION -- Vatican television said it plans a live broadcast on Saturday of a confession by Salvatore Grigoli, a Sicilian mobster convicted of murdering an anti-Mafia priest, Giuseppe Puglisi, in 1993. The Justice Ministry agreed to transfer the prisoner to the Paul VI auditorium in the Vatican for the broadcast. Mr. Grigoli's talk, on ''spilling innocent blood,'' is part of a Jubilee Day dedicated to the Union of the Blood of Christ, a Catholic association.</p>

        <p>ITALY: STATE COMPANY CLOSES -- Italy closed a chapter of its modern history by shutting down I.R.I., the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction, a state holding company founded under Mussolini. At its peak in the 1960's, I.R.I. employed 600,000 people and controlled, among other assets, major shipping lines, Alitalia Airlines and R.A.I., the state television company. By 1997, I.R.I. carried a $12 billion debt, and was given three years by the treasury to sell off its holdings and go out of business.</p>

        <p>CHINA: FALUN GONG -- A Chinese Army officer, Lt. Col. Zhao Xinli, has been committed to a psychiatric hospital for refusing to renounce the practice of Falun Gong, the exercise and meditation group banned last year, according to a Hong Kong rights group. Detentions of Falun Gong members in some cities have increased in the last week, the Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said. Most practitioners are briefly detained, but officials have remanded more recalcitrant members to prisons, labor camps or psychiatric hospitals.</p>

        <p>MYANMAR: U.N. ENVOY IN TALKS -- A new United Nations envoy will go to Myanmar for three days of talks with the military rulers and Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, an elected government still in waiting since its victory in 1990 was never acknowledged by the junta. The envoy, Razali Ismail of Malaysia, is a former ambassador to the United Nations who was known for his forthright style. The junta, which calls itself the State Peace and Development Council, has said it hoped for more sympathy from an Asian. The former envoy was a Peruvian.</p>

        <p>JORDAN: PALESTINIAN DIES -- A young Palestinian police officer, Yousef Mahmoud Abu Nahel, who was critically injured in mid-May in an exchange of fire between Palestinian officers and Israeli soldiers in Ramallah, died in a hospital in Jordan. There will be a military funeral for him in Gaza today; he is the seventh Palestinian to die as a result of the violence last month.</p>

        <p>IRAQ: AIR MANDATE RENEWED -- The Turkish Parliament renewed permission for American and British planes to use the Incirlik air base to patrol the no-flight zone over northern Iraq. Parliament has extended the mandate every six months since the end of the 1991 Persian Gulf war, when the zone was set up.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS -- BRAZIL: SENATOR EXPELLED -- For the first time in its history, the Brazilian Senate has expelled a member. Luiz Estevao, a prominent real estate developer and member of the ruling coalition, was accused of having siphoned off more than $100 million in government money intended for the construction of a federal courthouse in Sao Paulo. With the expulsion, Mr. Estevao, who denied the charges, also loses his parliamentary immunity and is expected to be arrested shortly.</p>

        <p>SUDAN: U.N. CURBS STAY -- Under pressure from the United States, the Security Council postponed until mid-November -- after the American presidential election -- a decision on whether to lift sanctions on Sudan. The government of Sudan has now met all the requirements imposed in 1996, after the Sudanese were accused of harboring several suspects in the attempted assassination of the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak. Diplomats say all 14 other council members want sanctions lifted.</p>
