        <p>METS fans greet the dawn of a new day this morning with a rush of anticipation of a big showdown. The Mets open a four-game series with Atlanta in what can safely be called the first critical series of the season.</p>
        <p>''We've got a lot of important games coming up,'' Mike Piazza said yesterday. ''We're not going to put a do-or-die perspective on this series, but this is a huge series.''</p>
        <p>More than the Yankees, more than any other National League team, Atlanta is a franchise that has defined the Mets in recent years; it is the franchise against which the Mets measure themselves.</p>
        <p>But this time the terms of the competition are different. This time the competition has a face, a name, a personality. The new face of the Atlanta Braves belongs to John Rocker, the relief pitcher whose anti-gay, anti-ethnic, anti-New York comments in a magazine article last year earned him a fine and suspension, as well as a notoriety that has made him something of a pariah.</p>
        <p>Rocker is a product of the dot.com age of information, in which every word, every image, is captured by a widening range of news media. Devoured.</p>
        <p>In the long, meandering history of the Braves -- from Boston to Milwaukee to Atlanta -- the face of the franchise has often been a player: Warren Spahn, the Hall of Fame pitcher; Hank Aaron, the career home run leader. During the last decade the face of Atlanta has been its three All-Star pitchers: Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz.</p>
        <p>Then John Rocker decided to go off on his own and grab the marquee billing: like Gladys Knight and the Pips, or Diana Ross and the Supremes, it's now John Rocker and the Atlanta Braves. Rocker was stunning last season and suffocated the Mets. Near the end of National League Championship Series, the Mets began to reach Rocker.</p>
        <p>Last night, Lenny Harris said he believed that Rocker lost more that a few games with his statements. He lost part of that mantle of a closer's invincibility.</p>
        <p>Harris said he feels Rocker may have lost some face. ''We used to look at him and say: 'Man, here comes Rocker. This guy, he's tough to hit,' '' Harris said. ''Then next thing you know, he comes out with something like this. You say: 'Aw man, this guy is silly. He doesn't know what he's talking about.' He's lost some respect; he's lost a lot of points out there. When I saw I was going to face John Rocker, I'm like, this dude here is pretty bad. I've really got to let him make a mistake before you can beat him. Now you're like, 'Forget it' at the plate. 'I'm going to try to kill this guy.' ''</p>
        <p>Now Rocker is dragging his teammates into a fray they didn't want to be in. The team and Rocker will be protected like a visiting premier or minister to New York.</p>
        <p>''I know it's a distraction for that team,'' Harris said. ''You can tell by the comments his teammates make from time to time.''</p>
        <p>Atlanta with Rocker has become like a traveling medicine show, with a beefed-up news media asking the same questions, dredging up the same history. Rocker, attempting to hold true to character, is still running to the mound, still pumping his fists and assuming the bravado of the conqueror.</p>
        <p>The bottom line is how will this affect the standings. Will the Mets lose or gain from Atlanta's distraction? The Rocker of this season is hardly the Rocker of old. He has 12 saves, but his control has been so inconsistent -- why isn't that surprising? -- that he was sent briefly to the minors. He'll be tested as never before during Atlanta's four games in New York.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be exciting baseball, like a playoff atmosphere,'' Piazza, the Mets' catcher and top hitter, said. ''There's going to be a lot of reaction. But we're not going to go into this series and lose our focus on baseball. We can't worry about one guy. You got Greg Maddux, you got Tom Glavine, Andruw Jones, Chipper Jones.''</p>
        <p>Piazza, unlike Harris, said he doesn't think more or less of Rocker as a player because of what he said as a civilian. ''I always try to humanize my opponents,'' Piazza said. ''I've never built anybody up. I don't build up these huge confrontations because I get too wired.''</p>
        <p>The prelude to the series with Rocker and Atlanta began as the Mets completed a  sweep of Florida last night for their seventh straight victory.</p>
        <p>Now fasten those seat belts. The Mets, frustrated by Atlanta for the last three seasons, must overcome history to overcome Atlanta. Atlanta's problem is much more deep-seated. Rocker's Braves not only need a new personality, they desperately need a face lift.</p>
