        <p>Two divergent literary groups converged this month on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. One was made up of the editors of The Paris Review, a distinguished quarterly of literature and poetry. The other was the Electronic Literature Organization, a new group founded to support the works of hypertext authors. A quirky clan of writers who write for the computer screens, hypertext authors invite readers to chart their own paths through stories by clicking on seemingly random words.</p>
        <p>The gathering, with George Plimpton as host, was something of a coming out party for the hypertext crowd, said Robert Coover, an author of traditional novels and a champion of new media. Amid wall-to-wall bookshelves on the second floor of the Paris Review's offices, Mr. Coover and other E.L.O. founders used a slide-show screen and laptop computer to project images of the E.L.O.'s Web site (www.eliterature.org) and samples of previous hypertext projects.</p>

        <p>Some members of the audience, whose eyes were wandering, did not appear to be immediately persuaded. But at least, some hypertext authors said, they were getting a glimpse.</p>
        <p>The next step is to try to get traditional writers interested in embarking on what Mr. Plimpton called a field of writing that he knew ''nothing about.''</p>
