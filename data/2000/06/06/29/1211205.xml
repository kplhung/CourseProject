        <p>Lawyers presented closing arguments today in a pretrial hearing to determine whether Michael C. Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy's, should be tried as an adult for the 1975 murder of his next-door neighbor, Martha Moxley.</p>
        <p>This afternoon's summations followed the testimony of three defense witnesses who said that Mr. Skakel never confessed to the killing in the late 1970's while he was attending a private school for troubled youths in Maine, contradicting two prosecution witnesses who testified last week that he had admitted the crime.</p>
        <p>In fact, today's witnesses said Mr. Skakel had vehemently denied any involvement in the killing, but had buckled somewhat under beatings and humiliation from school officials and classmates, saying that he could not recall what happened the night Miss Moxley died.</p>
        <p>One former classmate, Sarah Petersen, testified that the school's director, Joseph Ricci, once said, ''Skakel, you'll never leave here until you admit you killed that girl.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Skakel, now 39, is charged as a juvenile because he was 15 at the time Miss Moxley, also 15, was found bludgeoned to death with a golf club under a tree in her family's yard in Greenwich, Conn. A juvenile court judge must now decide if there is ''reasonable cause'' to try Mr. Skakel as an adult.</p>
        <p>In his closing argument, the prosecutor, Jonathan C. Benedict, said  that there was, and that because Mr. Skakel could not be sent to a juvenile institution he should be tried as an adult.</p>
        <p>A conviction as an adult could mean life in prison, while a conviction as a juvenile would carry little if any jail time.</p>
        <p>In his closing argument, Mr. Skakel's defense lawyer, Michael Sherman, argued that even if his client were guilty, no jail time would be necessary. The law in 1975 put a priority on rehabilitation of juvenile offenders, and Mr. Sherman argued that this case has the benefit of nearly a quarter-century's hindsight.  ''For 25 years, he has lived an exemplary life,'' Mr. Sherman said of his client. ''Even if he did do it, he still does not need rehabilitation.''</p>
        <p>The judge, Maureen Dennis, said she would issue a written decision as soon as possible after carefully reviewing transcripts of testimony and the law as it existed in 1975 regarding the transfer of juvenile cases to Superior Court.</p>
        <p>The pretrial hearing resumed this morning with an added air of drama because Mr. Skakel's cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was sitting in the front row of the small courtroom.</p>
        <p>I am here to support my cousin,'' Mr. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer, said. ''This is a horrible, unspeakable tragedy, but it only compounds it to blame Michael, who is innocent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherman called three former students at the Elan School in Poland Spring, Me., who testified that they never heard a confession from their classmate, Mr. Skakel.</p>
        <p>''The whole time I knew Michael Skakel there, he said over and over again he wasn't responsible for what happened,'' said the first witness, Alice Dunn.</p>
        <p>But she testified that Mr. Skakel changed his story after being beaten during a group therapy session called a ''general meeting.'' As part of the meeting, she said, Mr. Skakel was put into a boxing ring where a succession of fellow students were  sent in to hit him. ''I saw him beaten into submission,'' Ms. Dunn testified. ''Only then he said over and over again: 'I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.' ''</p>
        <p>Under cross-examination, Ms. Dunn admitted telling a grand jury last year that in private conversations after the general meeting, Mr. Skakel told her that he might have been responsible for the murder.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if I did it; it was either myself or my brother but I don't know if I did it. I was in a blackout. I don't remember what happened,'' Mr. Benedict said, quoting from the grand jury transcript. Ms. Dunn replied, ''Yes, it was part of my testimony,'' but she insisted that she never took those comments to be a confession.</p>
        <p>Mr. Skakel's older brother, Thomas, was also a suspect in the Moxley killing, but recently his lawyer, Emanuel Margolis, said officials did not believe he was involved.</p>
        <p>The final defense witness was Bernadette Coomaraswamy, a lawyer and state magistrate, who was a juvenile court prosecutor in the 1970's and a close friend of the Skakel family's who lived nearby. She testified that she did not believe Mr. Skakel needed further rehabilitation.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Benedict asked if her assessment was based on the premise that Mr. Skakel was not guilty, she said, ''No.'' Mr. Sherman asked her to clarify that no rehabilitation would be needed even if Mr. Skakel were guilty. ''Even if he did it,'' she said. ''Yes.''</p>
