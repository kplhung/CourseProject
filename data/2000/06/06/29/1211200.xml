        <p>One of the nation's largest credit card companies agreed today to a demand from bank regulators to reimburse its customers at least $300 million for misleading and improperly billing them.</p>
        <p>The regulators accused the Providian Financial Corporation, the nation's sixth-largest issuer of credit cards, of deceiving hundreds of thousands of consumers, many of them with credit problems, with phone calls and mass mailings full of confusing sales pitches. As a result, people paid annual fees when they had been told there would be none, received credit cards they did not know they had signed up for and were subjected to higher interest rates than the company had advertised, according to the government, which conducted a yearlong investigation.</p>
        <p>Providian signed a joint agreement with the federal Comptroller of the Currency, the attorney general of California and the San Francisco district attorney's office. Providian agreed to halt the practices objected to by regulators.</p>
        <p>About 3 million of Providian's 13 million customers are likely to receive reimbursement checks later this year, regulators said. In addition to the $300 million in reimbursements, which regulators called a minimum, Providian will pay a $5.5 million fine to the City of San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Consumer advocates said the $300 million in restitution was one of the largest penalties they knew of in a case involving consumer deception. It is 10 times the amount Wall Street analysts had initially expected and will wipe out the equivalent of more than one-third of Providian's 1999 profits after taxes.</p>
        <p>''Providian has engaged in a pattern of abusing consumers by misleading them,'' said Daniel P. Stipano, the director of the comptroller's enforcement and compliance division.</p>
        <p>As part of the agreement, Providian, whose credit card operation is led by David R. Alvarez, neither acknowledged nor denied breaking the law but did agree to change its practices.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, we thought seriously about fighting'' the government, Shailesh Mehta, Providian's chief executive, said today in a conference call with reporters. ''This was purely a business decision'' based on the calculation that litigation would have cost more than the settlement, Mr. Mehta added.</p>
        <p>In recent months, the number of consumers complaining to the comptroller's office about Providian's practices has declined significantly, Mr. Mehta said.</p>
        <p>The bank, which is based in San Francisco, was the nation's fastest-growing issuer of credit cards over the 12 months ended March 31, increasing the size of its portfolio -- which is chiefly credit card debt -- by 54 percent, according to Friedman Billings Ramsey, an investment banking firm in Arlington, Va.</p>
        <p>Providian focuses its marketing on the growing number of Americans who have credit problems and is known for its sophisticated use of databases in singling out potential customers.</p>
        <p>The case, which regulators said began because of complaints from Providian customers, also offers the latest evidence of a growing consumer backlash against credit card companies struggling to maintain their profit margins. So many consumers have complained about receiving their bills too close to the payment deadline to avoid a late fee, for example, that the comptroller began an investigation into the practice earlier this year. Bank One's giant First USA credit card unit has received the most complaints.</p>
        <p>The agreement comes as bank regulators, state officials and members of Congress are vowing to look more closely at predatory lending, particularly to people with bad credit histories or low incomes.</p>
        <p>''This is an historic occasion,'' said June D. Cravett, the head of the consumer and environmental protection unit of the San Francisco district attorney's office. She said it indicated that federal regulators were now paying more attention to the banks' treatment of their customers.</p>
        <p>Most of the current government efforts against this sort of fraud focus on confusing, high-interest home-equity loans that are pitched to people who often have few other lines of credit open to them and can lose their houses if they default. In 1994, Congress passed a law intended to curb deceptive loans by increasing disclosure by lenders, but regulators have since warned that the law has had little effect. The Federal Reserve recently formed a multiagency task force that is studying ways to curb predatory lending.</p>
        <p>Consumer advocates said the Providian settlement showed that home-equity loans were not the only worrisome practice in the so-called sub-prime lending market. ''People who don't have good credit are preyed upon in all sorts of areas -- when they try to get a credit card, when they try to get a home-equity loan, when they try to get a mortgage on a house,'' said Frank Torres, the legislative counsel at Consumers Union, an advocacy group that publishes Consumer Reports.</p>
        <p>The case also reflects a new level of aggressiveness among bank regulators, they said. The comptroller, part of the Treasury Department, has indicated that it now considers deceptive lending practices to be a potential threat to banks' ''safety and soundness,'' which it is responsible for monitoring. And the government's agreement with Providian is the first time regulators have punished a company by using the Federal Trade Commission Act, Mr. Stipano said. The act gives the government latitude to investigate marketing practices.</p>
        <p>In its agreement with Providian, the comptroller described selling pitches that one regulator compared to a Catch-22.</p>
        <p>In one pitch, Providian boasted of charging no annual fee but then required customers to pay $156 a year for credit protection, the government said. If, after seeing the charge, they asked not to receive the protection, they were charged an annual fee.</p>
        <p>In another, Providian telemarketers, working from scripts, refused to tell people what interest rate they would receive no matter how many times they asked. Instead, the employees would repeat, using slightly varied language, the idea that Providian would significantly beat a consumer's current interest rate. In reality, the difference was usually slight and, because of the complicated rules, often ended up being higher, Mr. Stipano said.</p>
        <p>Providian made the confusing sales pitches to people with both poor and normal credit.</p>
        <p>To make the payments to customers, Providian said it would use $36 million of cash reserves and take a $163 million charge. Because restitution is tax deductible, it will not show up as a $300 million loss on the company's earnings report. Providian still faces many private lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Last week, when Providian announced the likely size of a settlement, its stock fell more than 10 percent. Today, it gained $2, to $85, as investors were cheered by the news that the case is now largely over, said Todd Pitsinger, an analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey.</p>
