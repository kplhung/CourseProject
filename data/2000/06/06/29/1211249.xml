        <p>The transportation and logistics battalions began arriving several months ago. Sailors have been brought from as far away as the Middle East. Dozens of American warships are preparing to take position in line with several aircraft carriers, destroyers and cruisers from across the globe.</p>
        <p>Battle stations, New York. OpSail is coming.</p>
        <p>In what the planners say will be the biggest maritime operation in history, more than 300 military ships from nations across the world will be sailing into the waterways around New York City for the millennium's July 4th.</p>
        <p>The review of military vessels, parade of tall ships and a fireworks display will close out a series of events in a big show beginning this weekend that will include concerts, receptions and tours of ships.</p>
        <p>The last time there were so many military ships in New York Harbor, naval officers joked, the British were about to invade.</p>
        <p>But managing the logistics and security is no joke. Officials from the Navy, Coast Guard, Secret Service and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have long been preparing for visits from 300 ships participating in the events, somewhere between 40,000 and 70,000 private boats carrying spectators, more than 12,000 military personnel, more than 5,200 invited guests, hundreds of Secret Service agents and the president of the United States in an area that appears -- to the nonboater -- to be without traffic lights, marked lanes or enforceable speed limits.</p>
        <p>''Son, it is going to be crazy,'' said one naval officer, who did not want his name used because, of course, the official military line is: ''It's all under control.''</p>
        <p>Ultimate responsibility for the operation, which was ordered by Congress as a millennium celebration, falls to Rear Adm. John B. Padgett III, the commander of the Navy's Northeast Region, and Rear Adm. H. G. Ulrich III, the commander of Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12. But more than 1,500 people have been working for months to pull together the operation.</p>
        <p>In February the Navy and Coast Guard began bringing in security workers, housing them in New York City hotels. Early this month, they moved them to a command center at Pier 94 near West 54th Street, where they have been elbow-to-elbow with the Secret Service, the Port Authority, other government agencies and the ''force protection'' units, which will be responsible for escorting ferries carrying invited guests and enforcing the normal water traffic laws, monitoring everything from litter to speed.</p>
        <p>There will even be space for the Judge Advocate General's office, in the event that someone in the military needs to be disciplined.</p>
        <p>''They have been working on planning this thing for almost two years,'' said Chief Petty Officer William Messing, who is helping coordinate the transportation and logistics for the events, officially called International Naval Review 2000 and OpSail 2000.</p>
        <p>Navy and Coast Guard personnel will help enforce special regulations: pleasure craft cannot travel faster than 10 knots (about 8 miles per hour); no seaplanes over the Hudson; boats must stay away from the staging area on Governors Island, the command center for the anti-terrorism forces.</p>
        <p>And there is to be nothing but water within 500 yards of the U.S.S. Hue City, a guided-missile cruiser that will have President Clinton aboard while he reviews the parade of ships.</p>
        <p>The first time Congress passed an enabling act to allow warships of other countries to enter domestic United States waters was in 1890, when President Benjamin Harrison was authorized to invite foreign warships to a naval review in New York Harbor to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Columbus's landing in 1892.</p>
        <p>Congress passed a similar enabling act in October 1996 to commemorate the millennium, and this time, warships from 43 nations are coming. The American contingent during the review will include 14 government ships -- one from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 3 from the Coast Guard and 10 from the Navy -- and the Marine Corps is providing land-sea amphibious assault vehicles for demonstrations around the city.</p>
        <p>At about 8 a.m. on July 4, the president, on the Hue City, will pass the anchored warships lining the harbor and the river to the George Washington Bridge. The review will be followed at 9:45 by a parade of about 300 tall ships. In the evening, 60,000 fireworks will be fired from 13 barges anchored at five locations in the harbor.</p>
        <p>The command center team at Pier 94 will be watching over all that, as well as helping coordinate some side shows, including the movements of three New York Fire Department tugs, which will be spouting arching lines of red, white and blue water.</p>
        <p>One of the most difficult tasks, those involved say, has been amassing the resources to transport guests  from shore to three Navy ships -- 2,500 to the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy; 1,700 to the amphibious assault ship Nassau, a carrier-like craft for helicopters; and 1,000 to the destroyer Mount Whitney.</p>
        <p>To get V.I.P.'s from the shore to the ships, the organizers turned to  NY Waterway, which normally ferries 32,000 commuters to and from  New York City each day.</p>
        <p>For several months, Arthur Imperatore Jr., the president of NY Waterway, has been directing construction of landing barges that will nestle against ships and docks that are too high or too low for ferry boarding.</p>
        <p>In the days before the events, the Secret Service will conduct security sweeps of the barges, ferries and docks to be used by the guests.</p>
        <p>''This is the biggest naval review of all time, and they want things to go without a hitch,'' Kenneth Favara, a construction superintendent at NY Waterway, said as he and Mr. Messing reviewed the construction of two barges in a Weehawken, N.J., shipyard.</p>
        <p>Mr. Favara has worked on projects for the city before, like building barges for an emergency evacuation of Rikers Island. But after talking to a supervising Secret Service agent, he realized that he had done nothing like this.</p>
        <p>''I've got a guy who is doing a plumbing job next week over there,'' he said, pointing to a Manhattan pier. Then he added with a playful smile: ''But the Secret Service lady told me that I might want to hold off on that, unless I want my guy to be starring down the barrel of a couple of AK-47's.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 30, 2000, Friday  An article yesterday about preparations for the festival of tall ships and military vessels in New York Harbor next week misstated the mile-per-hour equivalent of 10 knots, the speed limit to be imposed for pleasure boats. Ten knots is 11.5 miles per hour, not 8.</p>
