        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>At the City Council's hearing on whether left-handed people should be protected by anti-discrimination law (news article, June 22), a high school student called it discriminatory that banisters and handrails are often on the right side of public stairwells -- at least from the perspective of someone climbing up.</p>

        <p>At the City Council's hearing on whether left-handed people should be protected by anti-discrimination law (news article, June 22), a high school student called it discriminatory that banisters and handrails are often on the right side of public stairwells -- at least from the perspective of someone climbing up.</p>
        <p>But people walk on stairs in both directions. It would seem the same stairwell that oppressively discriminates against lefties on the way up also discriminates against righties on the way down. Can they sue, too?</p>
        <p>The student also asserted that ''societal discrimination results in the death of the left-handed population an average of 14 years earlier than the right-handed population.'' However, the study that purported to reveal such a gap was soon refuted.</p>
        <p>A 1993 study by the National Institute on Aging found no increase in mortality associated with handedness -- not surprisingly, since insurance actuaries would long ago have made it their business to uncover such a correlation.</p>
