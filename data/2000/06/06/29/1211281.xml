        <p>MANHATTAN: HOTEL UNION CONTRACT  The New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council -- eight unions representing 25,000 New York hotel workers -- has negotiated a contract that calls for a 21.67 percent wage increase over the agreement's five years. The contract, which union members ratified on Tuesday, also improves health benefits and raises the maximum pension for future retirees to $1,000 a month from $750.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: NOBEL MONUMENT REJECTED  The Landmarks Preservation Commission voted 9 to 0 yesterday to reject a city plan for a monument dedicated to Alfred Nobel on the grounds of the American Museum of Natural History. The commission said the 19-foot statue was too large for the site. Some neighbors objected to the statue because of sidewalk congestion; others because Nobel invented dynamite.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: HOTEL PROTEST  Thirty residents of the Martha Washington Hotel demonstrated yesterday, citing construction hazards, tenant harassment and the beating of a union picket. Nonunion workers are renovating the single-room-occupancy hotel, at 30 East 30th Street, for tourists. Although some citations have been issued, heat and water disruptions persist, the protesters said. The owner, Property Markets Group, denied harassing anyone and said most tenants endorsed the upgrading of their rooms.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: CYCLIST KILLED  A cyclist died early yesterday after crashing into a Metropolitan Transit Authority bus near Shea Stadium. The police said the bus had just left the Casey Stengel depot at 5:19 a.m. and was crossing Roosevelt Avenue at 126th Street when the cyclist lost control, went over the handlebars and slammed into the bus's rear passenger door. James Anyansi, an M.T.A. spokesman, said that the bus driver had had the right of way.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: H.M.O. SCORECARD  The New York State Health Accountability Foundation, an organization that provides health care information to businesses, released a report yesterday on care provided by local health maintenance organizations. New York H.M.O.'s rated close to national averages in most areas. A notable exception was the percentage of children enrolled in commercial H.M.O.'s who are immunized: 76 percent in New York compared with the national average of 65 percent.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: EMERGENCY CELL PHONES  City officials announced that they had collected more than 18,000 cellular telephones that were being reprogrammed to automatically call 911. The phones will be distributed to livery cab drivers, victims of domestic violence and other people at risk. One thousand phones will soon become available for cabdrivers through the Taxi and Limousine Commission.</p>

        <p>PISCATAWAY: INTERNET SEX STING  The pastor of a Pennsylvania church was arrested in a sting operation yesterday when he arrived at a New Jersey fast-food restaurant for what he thought would be a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old boy he had met on an Internet chat room. The pastor, William Cabell, 53, of the Faith United Church of Christ in State College, Pa., was arrested when the ''boy'' turned out to be an F.B.I. agent.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: CHARTER SCHOOLS UPHELD  The state's highest court has upheld New Jersey's landmark charter school law. In its unanimous ruling yesterday, the State Supreme Court turned back attempts by school districts in Englewood, Clifton, Franklin Township and Highland Park to revoke charters of new schools in their towns. Public school officials who filed the lawsuit complained about loss of funds to charter schools, which are outside the control of local boards of education.</p>

        <p>CAMDEN: DELAWARE RIVER DREDGING  The House of Representatives, in a 249-to-176 vote late Tuesday night, defeated an amendment that would have withheld $29.8 million earmarked for the dredging of the Delaware river. United States Representative Rob Andrews, the amendment's sponsor, is pledging to work to halt the project, which he calls ''environmentally risky.'' The United States Army Corps of Engineers plans to deepen the river to 45 feet from its current depth of 40 feet to allow ships to carry more cargo to the Ports of Camden and Philadelphia. But environmentalists oppose the dredging, saying it could stir up river toxins.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: CORZINE LEADS IN POLL  A new opinion poll showed Jon S. Corzine, left, leading Representative Robert D. Franks in the race for United States Senate from New Jersey by a 46-to-26 percent margin, with 23 percent of voters undecided. The poll, by Quinnipiac University, showed that 62 percent of 1,004 registered voters had not yet heard enough about Mr. Franks to form an opinion of him. Three of five voters have been paying a fair amount of attention to the Senate race thus far, the poll showed.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: INDIAN DISPUTE  Accusing the federal government of trespassing on its land, the Schaghticoke Indian tribe is threatening to close part of the Appalachian Trail on the busy Fourth of July weekend. The decision could affect hundreds of hikers and campers who use the trail, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said on Tuesday. Officials said they would plan rerouting, creating a longer walk. The tribe says its efforts to deal with land claims and federal recognition continue to be frustrated.</p>
