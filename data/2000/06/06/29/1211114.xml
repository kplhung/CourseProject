        <p>MUSIC enthusiasts who have turned to the Internet to download their favorite rock, to name a popular genre, and have not been living under a rock for the last couple of years, are probably aware that the specter of music piracy haunts their every mouse click.</p>
        <p>Recently, the issue of copyright infringement has been rigorously raised by lawyers for the recording industry and some musicians -- Metallica, for example -- who complain that the swapping of music files by people who use online services like Napster amount to nothing less than the theft of intellectual property.</p>

        <p>MUSIC enthusiasts who have turned to the Internet to download their favorite rock, to name a popular genre, and have not been living under a rock for the last couple of years, are probably aware that the specter of music piracy haunts their every mouse click.</p>
        <p>Recently, the issue of copyright infringement has been rigorously raised by lawyers for the recording industry and some musicians -- Metallica, for example -- who complain that the swapping of music files by people who use online services like Napster amount to nothing less than the theft of intellectual property.</p>
        <p>Now help in protecting digital music on the Internet, which experts expect will become a $4 billion industry by 2004, appears to be coming from an unlikely source: the computer user's own sense of rhythm.</p>
        <p>Last week, Net Nanny International, a developer of Internet filtering software, announced that it had signed an agreement with the digital music retailer Musicrypt.com Inc.</p>
        <p>The agreement cleared the way for Musicrypt.com to use an encryption technology developed by Net Nanny to help prevent unauthorized music downloads. Net Nanny's patented biometric technology identifies computer users by the way they type in their passwords.</p>
        <p>This software-only security system, Called BioPassword, creates a user profile based on how a person types in a computer password.</p>
        <p>Technicians say that that the profile is derived from typing characteristics like hand size and speed, the pressure with which keys are struck and the length of time keys are held down, characteristics that are different for each person. Each time a person types in a password, BioPassword is able to identify them by their keystrokes.</p>
        <p>John Heaven, president and chief executive of Musicrypt.com, which was founded in 1998 and is based in Toronto, said in a telephone interview that turning to a biometric approach solved a number of problems.</p>
        <p>In the past, Mr. Heaven said, simple passwords offered little comfort to artists and recording companies because passwords could be shared, giving access to unauthorized users. And encryption schemes that lock the use of downloaded music to the computer that performed the download have not been popular for obvious reasons.</p>
        <p>''Now we are solving the machine lock-down problem that digital rights management has been trying to wrestle with,'' said Mr. Heaven, who explained that the downloaded music, no matter where it was played, would require a password from the user for authentication. This, he said, would make the music truly portable.</p>
        <p>''By actually authenticating a user, biometrics will provide the missing link to secure e-commerce transactions,'' said Samir Nanavati, a partner with the International Biometric Group, a New York-based biometric consulting company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heaven said he planned to launch the biometric security measures in the fall.</p>
