        <p>Providian Agrees to Pay $300 Million to Customers  Providian Financial, the nation's seventh-largest issuer of credit cards, agreed to a demand from bank regulators to reimburse its customers at least $300 million for misleading and improperly billing them.</p>
        <p>About 3 million of Providian's 13 million customers are likely to receive reimbursement checks later this year. Consumer advocates said the $300 million in restitution was one of the largest they knew of in a case involving consumer deception. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>Gannett to Buy Central Newspapers  Gannett, whose stable of newspapers is already the largest in the country, agreed to acquire Central Newspapers, the owner of The Arizona Republic, The Indianapolis Star and four other daily newspapers, for $2.6 billion in cash. The deal is the second largest in newspaper history, behind the Tribune Company's acquisition of the Times Mirror Company. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Tyco in a Deal for Mallinckrodt  Tyco International agreed to buy Mallinckrodt, a health care company, for $3.24 billion in stock. Tyco said it would also assume nearly $1 billion in Mallinckrodt debt. With the acquisition of Mallinckrodt, Tyco's health care business would become the leader in bulk analgesic pharmaceuticals and a leader in the fast-growing respiratory care business. Shares of Mallinckrodt rose $2.59375, to $31.34375. Tyco fell $2.3125, to $45. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Technology Shares Stage a Rally  The Nasdaq composite index jumped 81.38 points, or 2.1 percent, to 3,940.34. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 23.33 points, to 10,527.79. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 4.27 points, to 1,454.82. [C11.]</p>
        <p>Rumors for WorldCom and Sprint  WorldCom and Sprint have not yet called off their proposed merger, but already rumors are swirling about which companies might try to buy one of them. [C10.]</p>
        <p>FedEx Profit Beats Expectations  FedEx said its fourth-quarter profit rose 11 percent, to $245 million, or 85 cents a share, compared with $221 million, or 73 cents a share, in the period a year earlier, on a rebound in United States shipments. Analysts had expected 81 cents a share. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Investors Take Case to the Kremlin  A battle over Unified Energy Systems, Russia's electricity monopoly, intensified after a group of foreign investors who oppose a plan to overhaul the company took their case to the Kremlin. Investors representing about 15 percent of the company's stock met with Aleksandr Voloshin, above, the Kremlin chief of staff who is also chairman of Unified Energy's board. The meeting came a week after investors asked President Vladimir V. Putin to stop the reorganization plan, which they say would destroy the value of their holdings. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Campaign for an Internet Election  Public interest groups announced a voter registration campaign to recruit what it called cybercitizens and raise public awareness of an international election to help administer the Internet. The campaign urges Internet users to join the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which was selected in 1998 to take over administration of the network's domain name system. [C12.]</p>
        <p>2 Models for Predicting Elections  Economics now offers two distinct approaches to predicting election outcomes. One has its roots in macroeconomics, examining how national economic performance affects voting. The other is grounded in microeconomics, using a real financial market in which participants can place their bets on the results. Hal R. Varian: Economic Scene. [C2.]</p>
