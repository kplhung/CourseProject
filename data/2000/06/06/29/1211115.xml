        <p>Celebrations  Independence Day may not arrive officially until Tuesday, but on either side of the Hudson no one is waiting until then to set off the figurative fireworks. At 3:30 p.m. Saturday on the Great Lawn of Battery Park, the Alliance for Downtown New York will present a free concert featuring the Grammy Award-winning pop singer Shawn Colvin and the British folk rocker Billy Bragg. At the first Liberty State Park Music and Heritage Festival, in Jersey City on Saturday, music, sailing ships and other activities will surround an environmental conference. On the big day, at 7:15 p.m. Tuesday, Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra will spotlight the music of Louis Armstrong in a free two-set concert bracketing the fireworks at 9 p.m.</p>

        <p>Celebrations  Independence Day may not arrive officially until Tuesday, but on either side of the Hudson no one is waiting until then to set off the figurative fireworks.

        <p>Just Looking  ''Van Gogh: Face to Face'' has moved from Midwest to East. Covering the full range of the artist's portraiture, this popular exhibition, which started its tour in March at the Detroit Institute of Arts, opens on Sunday for a run through Sept. 24 at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Assembled from private collections and museums around the world, the show consists of some 80 drawings and paintings. Many works are being exhibited in the United States for the first time.</p>
        <p>Fusing Styles  What resulted when composers examined their national heritage and fused its style with the classical European musical tradition? That question will be addressed in ''Points of Origin: Composers Confront Their Traditions,'' this year's Summergarden series of eight weekends of free concerts in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art. Beginning tomorrow, the garden opens at 6 p.m each Friday and Saturday through Aug. 19; the concerts start at 8:30. The eight programs, performed by young artists and recent graduates of the Juilliard School of Music, feature the works of nearly 30 composers, particularly Bela Bartok, Charles Ives and Igor Stravinsky.</p>
        <p>Reflections  Interviews with the comedian and host Steve Allen, the documentary filmmaker Ken Burns, the cookbook author and host Julia Child, the actress Tyne Daly and others are featured on ''Perspectives,'' a new venture by the Museum of Television and Radio and RealNetworks. In the interviews, the subjects share memories of the people and events that shaped their careers and lives. ''Perspectives'' can be found at www.mtr.org and www.RealGuide.com and viewed by using RealPlayer</p>
