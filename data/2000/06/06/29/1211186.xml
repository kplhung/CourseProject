        <p>President Clinton turned an hourlong news conference today into an effort to bolster Vice President Al Gore's campaign and to defend him from accusations of campaign finance irregularities. He said Mr. Gore made ''a compelling case'' that he did nothing wrong and argued that the ''so-called scandals'' of the last eight years ''were bogus.''</p>
        <p>In a wide-ranging discussion that included gasoline prices, the death penalty, missile defense, Elian Gonzalez, prescription drug coverage and how much brain power it takes to be president, Mr. Clinton invoked Mr. Gore's name more than a dozen times.</p>
        <p>He dismissed polls showing Mr. Gore running behind Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, noting that this week alone one poll showed a 13-point lead for the presumed Republican candidate while another indicated a virtual tie. The president said that once Americans examine Mr. Gore's record, his economic policy and his understanding of new technology, ''it's still more likely than not that he will win.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said he did not see a need for Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint a special counsel to investigate Mr. Gore's involvement in campaign fund-raising, including his appearance at a Buddhist temple in California in April 1996. The president said that she had already considered, and rejected, an outside review and that ''the best thing to do is for the American people to make their own judgments about it.''</p>
        <p>But he seized the moment -- as he does increasingly often these days -- to argue that his White House has been repeatedly vindicated of wrongdoing despite a Washington ''scandal machine.''</p>
        <p>''The word 'scandal' has been thrown around here like a clanging teapot for seven years,'' he said. And he quickly cited a Washington Post column that he said concluded ''a whole bunch of this stuff was just garbage, and that we had totally innocent people prosecuted because they wouldn't lie.'' He cited numerous investigations of members of his cabinet, and of his own financial dealings in Arkansas, but never mentioned his impeachment.</p>
        <p>The president also plugged Mr. Gore when asked about the brain power needed to be a good president and gently tweaked Mr. Bush, who has said he plans to surround himself with the best advisers to compensate for areas in which he is not an expert.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's so much a question of intelligence generically,'' Mr. Clinton said in describing the qualities it takes to be president. ''I mean, I think it's more a question of curiosity and willingness to learn what you think is important,'' a clear reference to suggestions that Mr. Bush often skims the surface rather than delving deeply.</p>
        <p>''I guess I think that no president can say, well, it should be enough for the voters if I get the best advisers in my party and they come up with a position and I take it,'' he added. ''So what the voters will have to analyze here is how important is the fact that Al Gore spent 20 years working on arms control issues, for example, and dealing with all these things?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton spent most of his time pressing the legislative agenda for his last seven months in office. He urged Congress to take the deal he offered this week: prescription drug coverage for senior citizens, a longtime item on Mr. Clinton's list, in return for the elimination of the ''marriage penalty'' in the tax system, a longtime Republican desire.</p>
        <p>He urged the Senate to approve permanent normal trade relations with China, as the House has already. ''I ask Congress, let's not waste these precious weeks,'' he said. But his advisers acknowledge that Mr. Clinton will be lucky to get one or two of his priorities through an election-year Congress, and say he will focus instead on negotiating an Israeli-Palestinian peace by September, and other foreign policy initiatives.</p>
        <p>Asked about capital punishment, Mr. Clinton expressed concern about racial disparities among those facing execution for federal crimes. Seventeen of the 21 federal prisoners facing the death penalty are members of minority groups. Mr. Clinton also said he was concerned that prosecutors in a dozen Southern states had accounted for more than half of the federal cases in which the death penalty had been sought.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's comments gave some hope to lawyers for Juan Raul Garza, a migrant farm worker convicted of marijuana smuggling and three drug-related murders. He is scheduled next month to become the first person facing a federal execution in nearly 40 years.</p>
        <p>''We're encouraged by the president's comments,'' said Gregory Wiercioch, a lawyer with the Texas Defender Service who is representing Mr. Garza and preparing to file a request for clemency. ''What President Clinton is realizing is that the Justice Department's authorization is like a rigged lottery.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's news conference came shortly after the Supreme Court handed down several major rulings, and Mr. Clinton fielded questions on many of them, including the court's refusal to hear a case dealing with Elian Gonzalez -- who left Washington for Cuba only hours after Mr. Clinton spoke -- and its decision backing the Boy Scouts' ability to exclude gay members.</p>
        <p>He said he wished the return of Elian to Cuba had ''unfolded in a less dramatic, less traumatic way for all concerned.'' He made a last-minute offer to the departing family, ''If he and his father decided they wanted to stay here, it would be fine with me.''</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Clinton signaled no major departure from the United States embargo on Cuba, saying it would be up to Fidel Castro to reach out to the United States. He deflected comparisons to his recent decision to lift the embargo of commercial exchanges against North Korea -- despite the fact that North Korea had engaged in actions that closely parallel those he accused Fidel Castro of committing.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Clinton said he supported the notion of selling American food and medicine to Havana, the substance of a deal struck this week among House Congressional leaders, he said he was concerned about restrictions in the legislation on travel to the island.</p>
        <p>On the Supreme Court's decision to permit the Boy Scouts to bar gays, Mr. Clinton called the Scouts, of which he is honorary president, ''a great group.'' But he said he hoped the decision was ''just one step along the way of a movement toward greater inclusion in our society because I think that's the direction we ought to be going in.''</p>
