        <p>If New Yorkers with nothing else to do today planned to take a ride on the No. 7 train to Shea Stadium and hoped to be in the same car as John Rocker, they should find some other way to waste their time. Rocker, a baseball official said yesterday, has told Major League Baseball he will not take the train to the game the Atlanta Braves will play with the Mets tonight.</p>
        <p>Rocker, the Braves' walking controversy, had announced last week his intention to ride the same train whose occupants he disparaged in a magazine interview that earned him a suspension and a fine. But officials on all sides of baseball urged him to reconsider and use another means of transportation, and he has acceded to their wishes.</p>
        <p>''There will be no train ride,'' said the official with knowledge of Rocker developments. ''His concentration is on the game. These are very important games.''</p>
        <p>The Braves, who will play the Mets for the first time since their intense playoff clash last October, also issued a statement in which Jim Schultz, the team's public relations director, said, ''It's our understanding that Mr. Rocker is not going to ride the subway.''</p>
        <p>Such statements notwithstanding, New York City police officials said yesterday that a police detail would be at the team hotel today to accompany Rocker on whatever means of transportation he chooses. If he boards the team bus, the police will follow the bus. If he takes a taxi, they will follow the taxi. In short, they do not plan to let him out of their sight.</p>
        <p>Gene Orza, the players association's associate general counsel, said he conveyed his view to the relief pitcher that he should not take the train and added, ''I think he's interested in being cooperative.''</p>
        <p>In declaring last week that he would go to Shea by subway, Orza said, Rocker ''meant it in kind of the nature of an apology, saying to the people of New York, 'O.K., I'll ride the train and we'll have some fun with it.' ''</p>
        <p>But, Orza added: ''Given New York's security concerns, he wasn't going to see those people. He'd be surrounded by police officers. It would not be the kind of ride he initially envisioned, which was having some fun with the people in New York.''</p>
        <p>Kevin Hallinan, baseball's security chief, met with Rocker in Montreal, where the Braves played the past two days. Hallinan, the baseball official said, explained to Rocker the problems a subway ride would create and recommended he change his travel plans.</p>
        <p>Some police officials had an idea that Rocker should change his hotel plans, too, staying not in Manhattan at the hotel where the Braves stay but at the Marriott Hotel across from La Guardia Airport, only minutes from Shea Stadium. That change would keep Rocker away from crowded Manhattan streets and make it unnecessary for him to ride the No. 7 train. But the idea was dropped after Rocker assured the Braves that he would not take the train.</p>
        <p>Officials involved in providing protection for Rocker and security for the stadium met yesterday afternoon at police headquarters in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Five groups have signed up for a permit for a park area about 50 feet from the Willets Point/Shea Stadium subway station to protest Rocker's presence. It is unclear how many people the protest may draw, but police officials are prepared to deploy a large contingent of officers to oversee the 4:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. event.</p>
        <p>The department still plans to have about 600 officers on hand for the game. They will include an undisclosed number of plainclothes officers and others on horses to prevent fans from moving onto the field.</p>
        <p>In Montreal yesterday, some Braves players arrived in the visiting clubhouse to find the names above some lockers altered and the missing letters used above Rocker's locker to form a phrase that is insulting to gays. Rocker was not in the clubhouse at the time, and Wally Joyner, a Braves first baseman, rearranged the letters to spell the pitcher's name. Joyner said he wanted to remove the offending phrase before Rocker saw it.</p>
        <p>Rocker did not speak with reporters for a second straight day.</p>
