        <p>It has been something of an unofficial tradition in New York City for leaders of political parties to hold elective office, one notable exception  being on Staten Island. Now, that borough's Democratic Party chairman is trying to become a part of the wider tradition, and is discovering that change is not easy.</p>
        <p>Ordinarily, a party leader's path to an Election Day victory is a relatively clear one, assisted by the wide backing of his party's foot soldiers. But John W. Lavelle, the Democratic chairman on Staten Island, is seeing something less than unanimous good will and support for his quest to run for an Assembly seat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lavelle wants to succeed Elizabeth A. Connelly, who announced in April that she would not seek re-election after 27 years in office. But Mr. Lavelle finds himself with some competition from within his own party.</p>
        <p>Raymond G. Jorgensen, a Democratic district leader in the 59th Assembly District and a shop steward with Local 1180 of the Communications Workers of America, is running an aggressive campaign for the party's nomination in the September primary. And Mr. Jorgensen has made clear his objection to the prospect of Mr. Lavelle holding both positions.</p>
        <p>''He just became the party leader last year,'' Mr. Jorgensen said. ''He came in with the intention of rebuilding the party. There were other people interested in running, but John Lavelle swept everyone else's name out of the way and anointed himself as the candidate. You can't serve two masters.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lavelle, a Metropolitan Life Insurance Company executive, became Democratic Party chairman in September, after his predecessor, Robert J. Gigante, was elected a State Supreme Court justice. Mr. Lavelle said being an elected official would not only be in the tradition of his party counterparts, but would enable him to be a more effective party leader. Mr. Lavelle's decision surprised many Democrats. When he became party chairman, he told The Staten Island Advance that he had no interest in holding elective office.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Lavelle offered his name as a possible candidate within hours of Mrs. Connelly's announcement. And several others were waiting to run for the seat, including Mr. Jorgensen. Mrs. Connelly had even indicated her tacit support for another candidate, Michael J. Cusick, an aide to Senator Charles E. Schumer and former chief of staff to Assemblyman Eric N. Vitaliano.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Cusick's fate that left many Democratic officials bitter. Two days after Mrs. Connelly's announcement, Mr. Cusick's father, Peter P. Cusick, a State Supreme Court justice, died.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cusick had expressed interest in running for the Assembly seat, but he said he was overcome by the events surrounding his father's funeral. Within two weeks, party leaders met and, in the executive board, recommended that Mr. Lavelle receive the party's endorsement, a suggestion that was ratified at the party's convention. Mr. Cusick, a Democratic state committeeman, said that in the two weeks before the party convention, ''it looked like a consensus was building behind my candidacy.'' Of the political rallying behind Mr. Lavelle instead, he said he felt ''not betrayed, but disappointed by the way it happened.'' Mr. Cusick said he was disappointed that Mr. Lavelle ''went back on his promise not to run for office.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lavelle said he did not say that he would not run for office, but said he did not see himself pursuing the offices that would become open in 2001.</p>
        <p>Although most of Staten Island's Democratic elected officials -- including Mr. Cusick -- are now supporting Mr. Lavelle, several have suggested privately that it is without much enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jorgensen has sought to tap into that discontent, his efforts summed up in a campaign flier asking the question of the Democratic leader: ''Leader or Tyrant?''</p>
        <p>The 59th Assembly District includes many of the neighborhoods on Staten Island's north shore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jorgensen and Mr. Lavelle stress many of the same issues, including the need to improve public transportation in the borough.</p>
        <p>But there is another point on which they and most Staten Island Democratic leaders agree: the internal battle will not serve their party in November, when the victor must run against the Republican candidate.</p>
