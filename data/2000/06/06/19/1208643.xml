        <p>The more things change . . . ?</p>
        <p>It is 1930, and William Randolph Hearst is nervous. The medium called radio will not go away, and Mr. Hearst cannot get his newspaper executives to react quickly enough to the threat.</p>
        <p>This is what he told them, according to ''The Chief,'' a new biography by David Nasaw that was published by Houghton Mifflin:</p>
        <p>''Our publishers themselves may not be interested in radio but certainly their children are, and the publisher should learn from his children what an important part radio plays in the life of the nation today. It is an effort to read a newspaper; it is no effort to listen to a radio.''</p>
