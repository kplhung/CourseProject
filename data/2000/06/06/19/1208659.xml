        <p>Zach Apter, a 23-year-old management consultant in San Francisco, is hardly the typical CBS viewer; he cannot remember watching anything on CBS since he was in high school.</p>
        <p>That was before ''Survivor.'' Now Mr. Apter is so involved with the hit CBS series about survival and relationship tests on an tropical island near Borneo that he has organized a pool with his friends ($100 each) to select which contestant winds up as the final survivor.</p>
        <p>''It is the most over-the-top thing on TV that I've ever seen or heard of,'' Mr. Apter said. ''I'm not going to miss a single one.''</p>
        <p>These are words from a man who is less than half the median age of a viewer of CBS -- long identified as the network of the rural and the retired.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Apter is far from alone. ''Survivor,'' a breakout hit in every way, has stunned the television industry by generating for CBS the kind of ratings with young viewers that normally are associated with shows on the Fox network or ABC. Last week, ''Survivor'' pulled in the most viewers under the age of 50 of any series CBS has played on a Wednesday night at 8 p.m. in the 13-year history of the Nielsen people-meter system, which breaks down viewers into demographic groups.</p>
        <p>The show's success has enormous financial implications for CBS. Young viewers usually translate into high prices for commercials because many advertisers pay a premium to reach the young, who watch less television than older viewers and are more likely to be willing to change brands. One reason CBS's revenues have lagged behind those of other networks has been its inability to attract that premium money.</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' was sold in advance to full sponsors, including Reebok, Budweiser and the Army. But is has two 30-second commercials available for the rest of its episodes, and these are being snapped up by advertisers like movie companies, which always look to reach young viewers. An executive connected to the talks said CBS was charging as much as $300,000 each for these commercials, 50 percent more than the full sponsors have been paying.</p>
        <p>And in what will almost certainly create another windfall, CBS is considering expanding the ''Survivor'' finale on Aug. 23 from one hour to two, which would open up an hour's worth of high-priced commercials. The network may charge as much as $600,000 for the new spots. (In the final episode, the last four contestants will first be narrowed to two and then to one final survivor.)</p>
        <p>Many of the young viewers CBS is  hoping to cash in on simply had not been available to it before. Eric Robinson, a motion picture talent agent in New York, who is also 23, said, ''What other shows are on CBS?'' But he is watching ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>''I wanted to see the type of drama that would unfold with these people stuck on an island,'' he said. ''It's like 'Real World' meets 'Lord of the Flies.' And I wanted to see people eat rats.'' And so they did on last Wednesday's third episode of the 13-episode summer series.</p>
        <p>Elise Hartley, also 23, a government consultant in Washington, said she had heard about the show on a radio commercial -- not because she had been watching CBS.</p>
        <p>The fact that Ms. Hartley heard about the show through radio was not an accident. CBS, realizing it was unlikely to reach a young audience using only its own airwaves, began promoting ''Survivor'' last year on the Internet. Then it started buying time on outlets it knew young people would be plugged into: cable channels like MTV and Comedy Central and rock radio stations.</p>
        <p>Later, of course, that became much easier when Viacom merged with CBS, bringing along those two cable channels. CBS already had numerous radio stations in its corporate family through its subsidiary Infinity Broadcasting.</p>
        <p>But now CBS may not need MTV as much. The success of ''Survivor'' gives it an opportunity to speak directly to an audience it has not been able to reach for years.</p>
        <p>''We've had this goal for years, trying to get younger,'' said Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television. Three years ago he bought the  comedy ''Family Matters'' away from ABC, where it had a big audience among children and teenagers. They did not watch it on CBS. He tried police dramas like ''Easy Street'' and youthful comedies like ''Grapevine.'' They died quickly.</p>
        <p>But now the news is better thanks to what CBS is calling the halo effect  created by ''Survivor.'' Last week, for example, CBS had six of the top 10 shows among viewers between the ages of 18 to 49, a feat it had not achieved in any season in memory that did not include the Olympics.</p>
        <p>And a host of CBS shows have scored big gains from last year among viewers under 35: ''King of Queens'' is up 39 percent; ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' is up 34 percent; and the Monday edition of ''48 Hours'' is up 37 percent.</p>
        <p>Most telling, is that in the last two weeks CBS has plugged the two-hour slot after ''Survivor'' on Wednesday nights with repeats of theatrical movies; they were up 110 percent with viewers under 35.</p>
        <p>CBS is moving as best it can to capitalize on the access ''Survivor'' is providing to the young crowd. It already announced that it would change the start date of its follow-up reality series, ''Big Brother,'' from Thursday July 6, to Wednesday the July 5 to take advantage of the ''Survivor'' lead-in. (CBS has hopes that ''Big Brother,'' a documentary of the lives of 10 people locked together in a house where every move is on camera, will have similar fascination for younger viewers. It will run for 90 episodes.)</p>
        <p>Now CBS is revamping its Wednesday schedule for the summer. On June 28, the network will broadcast repeats of its two best comedies, ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' and ''King of Queens,'' from 9 to 10 p.m. after ''Survivor.'' Later this summer it will put shows like ''Judging Amy'' and ''JAG'' in that time period, hoping to showcase them for young viewers.</p>
        <p>That plans reflects Mr. Moonves's overall strategy of letting young viewers see the CBS shows they may have liked all along.</p>
        <p>''There is no reason why the median age for 'Raymond' is 49 and the media age for 'Frasier' is 41,'' he said. ''Other than the fact that one is on CBS and the other is on NBC.'' He said CBS would use ''Survivor'' to promote some new shows for fall, including ''Yes, Dear,'' which is about young married couples, and the remake of ''The Fugitive.''</p>
        <p>Studios that have been reluctant to sell their better shows to CBS because they did not think they could appeal to young viewers may come calling if they think they have a shot at the time period after ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>Though they are watching the show, at least some of the young viewers are not taking it too seriously. One of the participants in Mr. Apter's ''Survivor'' pool, Ben Decker, a 24-year-old management consultant from San Francisco, called the program ''sort of ludicrous'' and questioned whether it was going to work for CBS in the long run. But for now he is totally committed to CBS -- at least one night a week. After all, he has a serious rooting interest.</p>
        <p>''What we really find funny is watching CBS drum up suspense and contention between the contestants,'' he said. ''I think if CBS could, they would set these people against each other with swords and tridents in a pit full of tigers.''</p>
