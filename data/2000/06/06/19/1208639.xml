        <p>Call it the Web portal to the great beyond.</p>
        <p>''Welcome to heavenlydoor.com! Find a funeral home or cemetery near you!'' reads the greeting on the home page of HeavenlyDoor.com, which has been busily signing deals to offer one-stop shopping for a complete line of death-related services.</p>
        <p>Just last week it announced deals with SympathyFlowers.com; Classicmemorials.com; Mooney &amp; Company, a provider of sympathy and cremation cards; and the Funeral Fine Art Collection, which according to the news release offers ''high-end urns.''</p>
        <p>The deals enable the partners to sell their wares on HeavenlyDoor.com's site, in exchange for up to 40 percent of the revenues.</p>
        <p>The company was formed in November and went public in January, and so far it has mainly offered a free online service linking people who want to plan funerals -- in many cases, years before anyone actually dies -- with one of the 100 funeral homes it has signed up as members.</p>
        <p>But as last week's deals indicate, the company is expanding into transactions. Helen Maynard, HeavenlyDoor's senior vice president, said the company was discussing similar arrangements with insurance companies, airlines and hotels. Starting in September, the company plans to offer Heavenly Store, an online supermarket of funeral-related services.</p>
        <p>''Religious jewelry, ash-scattering services -- there are just so many facets of the funeral industry that people don't automatically think of on their own,'' Ms. Maynard said.</p>
        <p>But there's a business-to-business play in the works, too. By autumn, HeavenlyDoor hopes to have an electronic marketplace up and running that will hook funeral homes up with makers of caskets, embalming fluids and other vendors.</p>
        <p>Ms. Maynard said HeavenlyDoor.com planned to negotiate discount contracts for its funeral-director members, and would hope to make its money in transaction fees.</p>
