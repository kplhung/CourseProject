        <p>Vivendi, Seagram Boards Meet to Consider Merger  The boards of both Vivendi and Seagram met over the weekend to weigh Vivendi's $33 billion acquisition of Seagram. A decision was expected as early as today.</p>

        <p>When Assault Victims Are Identified  Amateur video taken during the attacks on dozens of women after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on June 11 were widely disseminated, but usually with the women's faces blurred so they could not be identified. But on five news programs and in The New York Post, the women were clearly identifiable, several with their shirts taken off and others with no clothes at all. The coverage showed how competition can overtake news organizations in a 24-hour news cycle and how questionable ethical decisions made by one outlet can influence others. [C13.]</p>
        <p>Banks Push One-Stop Shopping  Banks and brokerage firms are racing to offer the newest thing in online financial services: a single place where customers can find up-to-date information about all of their financial accounts. Less than a year ago, big financial firms saw this innovation, known as account aggregation, as a threat to their customers' privacy and financial security. But now, fearing an onslaught of competition on the Internet, they are embracing it as a convenience for customers and a powerful tool for building their own business. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Questioning a Microsoft Initiative  Microsoft plans to announce a new initiative this week that would shift the locus of computing off the desktop and out into a ''cloud'' of large server computers located on the Internet. The goal is to maintain a central role for Microsoft's software. But an influential critic, David Gelernter, said the plan misjudged the computer industry's direction -- that rather than moving to an increasingly Web-centric model, computing is instead becoming rapidly decentralized, with the key information distributed among millions of individual desktop computers.

        <p>Guideposts Magazine to Accept Ads  Guideposts magazine, founded by Dr. Norman Vincent Peale 55 years ago, has been spinning out stories filled with hope and inspiration, and it has refused to run any form of advertising. But that is about to change. Faced with the same problems that are affecting the rest of the subscription-only magazine industry, Guideposts has decided to start accepting advertising in January, albeit from ''wholesome'' sources.

        <p>Genomics as the New New Thing  Soon, perhaps within days, researchers expect to announce completion of the decade-long project to map the human genome. Stand by for the New Genomics to become the next big thing in the New Economy. Aided by extensive computer processing power, the genome researchers have been engaged in what is essentially a giant software project. Sequencing the human genome involves sifting through the three billion units of DNA at the heart of every human cell to identify the 80,000 or so genes that define all inheritable physical and behavioral traits.

        <p>Aetna Said to Reject ING Offer  ING Groep, based in the Netherlands, said Aetna had rejected its offer to buy Aetna's financial-services and international units because it was not high enough. ING also confirmed that Aetna was talking with other companies about buying those divisions. [C2.]</p>
