        <p>Other pros had a lot to say about Woods's domination of the Open.</p>
        <p>David Duval, who shot 71 to finish seven over par: ''What I like best about this tournament is the fact that if you're playing excellent golf, you can do what Tiger's doing, and if you're not quite on, you do kind of what I did. It exposed where my weaknesses have been this year and where I haven't been as sharp as I needed to be.''</p>

        <p>Other pros had a lot to say about Woods's domination of the Open.</p>
        <p>David Duval, who shot 71 to finish seven over par: ''What I like best about this tournament is the fact that if you're playing excellent golf, you can do what Tiger's doing, and if you're not quite on, you do kind of what I did. It exposed where my weaknesses have been this year and where I haven't been as sharp as I needed to be.''</p>
        <p>Fred Couples, who shot 73 to finish nine over par: ''Whoever beats Tiger has to play his best. But he's so strong and making so many birdies; I can count the putts I made on one hand and he's made four or five putts a day. But it's fun to see. He's a great player and what he's doing here is basically lapping the field.''</p>
        <p>Rocco Mediate, who shot 77 to finish 13 over par: ''Tiger Woods is the man, plain and simple. I don't know why it is some people are doubting this guy a bit. I had people asking me if anyone could catch him. Are you kidding me? As long as he was upright, he was going to win. I really think he can win 10, 15 tournaments a year.''</p>
        <p>Tom Kite, who shot 71 to finish 13 over par: ''You need competition. I think there will be some players who will step up to the plate. Some good young players. I think Tiger wants that. He wants that competition. He wants to be pushed, and he needs it. The best victories anybody has is when you have to fight the hardest.''</p>
        <p>Paul Azinger, who shot 69 to finish eight over par: ''I think some people said Tiger didn't have the game to win the U.S. Open. Whenever you put the onus on a guy like that, he shows up. He's a lot like Jack Nicklaus in that. There's a big gap in distance off the tee between him and the field, and he's just a terrific putter.''</p>
