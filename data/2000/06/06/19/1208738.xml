      <abstract>
        <p>Ian Reifowitz letter disputes June 15 letter criticizing white journalist David Simon for presuming to write about blacks (June 11 article in series on race relations); says that if we accept that race and ethnicity have trumped our ability to understand, empathize and write about the sufferings or joys of others, we are finished as a society</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I reject the argument made in a June 15 letter that David Simon, the  white journalist featured in the June 11 installment of your series on race, should not have written about black drug addicts in Baltimore because it was not ''his story to tell.'' This assumes that only black people can or should write about black people, and implies that there exists a single, unanimous perspective that all black Americans hold.</p>

        <p>Many black Americans did not grow up in an inner-city community, so they would not be any better ''witnesses'' than Mr. Simon to such a story. If this philosophy is pushed to its fullest conclusion, only autobiographies will become acceptable representations of life. If we accept that race and ethnicity have trumped our ability to understand, empathize and write about the sufferings or joys of those with whom we share this country, we are finished as a society.</p>
