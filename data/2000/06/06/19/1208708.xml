        <p>As Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigns around New York in her Senate bid, voters almost never ask her about Whitewater, the wide-ranging investigation into Arkansas land deals that an independent counsel has been pursuing for more than six years.</p>
        <p>Nor do they raise questions about the firing of workers in the White House travel office, her immense good fortune in the commodities markets, or any other matter that has been investigated. When a reporter makes a rare query along those lines, Mrs. Clinton successfully fends it off by saying that such things have been ''investigated to death'' and that she believes people are tired of them.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mrs. Clinton's campaign has been concerned enough to poll voters on their views about the investigations, which are nearing completion with her campaign in full swing.</p>
        <p>In the coming week, Robert W. Ray, the independent counsel who has been investigating the Clintons, is expected to file a report with a special judicial panel that will deal in part with whether Mrs. Clinton played any role in the firing of seven longtime employees in the White House travel office.</p>
        <p>The report will not be made public, but people close to the investigation say it is highly unlikely that it will recommend that anyone be criminally prosecuted. Mr. Ray, who replaced Kenneth W. Starr as the independent counsel last October, may announce that conclusion publicly.</p>
        <p>The report itself, which will remain under seal for at least three months, is expected to include a narrative that will touch on whether Mrs. Clinton was a force behind the decision to fire the employees and whether she or any White House aides tried to conceal her role.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's political aides have said they believe that scandal-weary voters no longer care about these issues. More to the point, her supporters have argued that the scandals have been shown to be without substance and that the Clintons have been targets of a concerted effort by their political enemies to discredit them and undo the results of two presidential elections.</p>
        <p>''I have no concern about these things,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a recent interview. ''I don't know how it will be used to be damaging to me, if that's the idea behind it.''</p>
        <p>Here is a summary of those issues, what Mrs. Clinton has said about them, what is publicly known and what questions remain.</p>
        <p>Travel Office Firings</p>
        <p>On May 19, 1993, only a few months into the Clinton administration, seven longtime employees of the White House travel office, which handles arrangements for journalists accompanying the president on trips, were dismissed and ordered off the White House grounds. They were quickly replaced by friends and relatives of the Clintons, most of them from Arkansas. White House officials said that evidence of gross financial mismanagement had led to the dismissals, allegations that were later found to be unsubstantiated.</p>
        <p>After several news reports suggested that the firings had been improper, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, looked into the matter and sent Mrs. Clinton a series of questions about her role in it.</p>
        <p>In March 1996, the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight began its own investigation and sent Mrs. Clinton additional questions. About the same time, Attorney General Janet Reno authorized Mr. Starr, the Whitewater prosecutor, to look explicitly into Mrs. Clinton's actions in the matter.</p>
        <p>The committee turned up what appeared to be a stark conflict between Mrs. Clinton's account of the shake-up and documents written by David Watkins, the senior White House aide who carried out the firings.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton portrayed herself as a peripheral figure, someone who had only casually asked to be kept informed. Mr. Watkins described a climate of fear stoked by Mrs. Clinton, who wanted the travel office employees fired immediately. In a memo to Thomas F. McLarty III, then the White House chief of staff, he wrote, ''we both knew there would be hell to pay'' if ''we failed to take swift and decisive action in conformity with the First Lady's wishes.''</p>
        <p>And in a written chronology of events leading up to the firing, Mr. Watkins quoted Mrs. Clinton as saying, ''We need those people out and we need our people in.'' He also wrote that he had spoken directly to Mrs. Clinton about his efforts to fire the employees. In addition, a week before the dismissals, he said, he had been told by Harry Thomason, an Arkansas friend of the Clintons and a Hollywood producer, that Mrs. Clinton told him she was ''ready to fire them that day.''</p>
        <p>In her response to the General Accounting Office, Mrs. Clinton said she had played no role in the decision to fire the employees, though she might have expressed concern about the travel office.</p>
        <p>Her lawyer told the G.A.O. that ''Mrs. Clinton does not know the origin of the decision to remove the travel office employees'' and that ''she did not direct that any action be taken by anyone with regard to the travel office other than expressing an interest in receiving information about the review.''</p>
        <p>In her answers to the House committee, Mrs. Clinton said she did not remember telling Mr. Thomason on May 12 that she was ready to fire the office employees that day. Although Mr. Watkins's documents portray Mrs. Clinton as intensely interested in the firings, she told the committee investigators that she had been greatly preoccupied with other matters.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to remember the specifics of conversations that occurred almost three years ago,'' she told investigators, adding that ''the spring of 1993 was a busy and stressful time.'' She said she was busy adjusting to ''a change in living circumstances, putting my daughter into a new school and increased entertainment and media demands of the White House,'' as well as attending to her father, who had suffered an ultimately fatal stroke.</p>
        <p>Arkansas Dealings</p>
        <p>Much of the investigation of Mrs. Clinton's role in the range of issues known collectively as Whitewater has centered on what she did as a lawyer for various Arkansas clients, and allegations that she tried to conceal or minimize her role.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray, the independent counsel, is expected to file his report on these matters with the special panel, made up of three judges, sometime in the fall. It is uncertain whether its contents will be available before the November election.</p>
        <p>One issue is how Mrs. Clinton came to represent Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, a thrift institution that was operated by James B. McDougal. Mr. McDougal and his wife, Susan, were partners of the Clintons in the Whitewater real estate investment in the Ozarks. Another issue is whether she sought to use her influence as the governor's wife to seek special treatment from a state agency for Madison, which was owned by her Whitewater partner.</p>
        <p>In the early years of the Whitewater controversy, Mrs. Clinton said that she became the billing partner at her law firm for Madison Guaranty because Richard Massey, a young associate at the firm, had asked for her help.</p>
        <p>She said that Mr. Massey brought in the account in 1985 because of his association with a young man who worked for Madison. In April 1994, she told a nationally televised news conference:</p>
        <p>''There was a very bright young associate in our office who had a relationship with one of the officers at Madison, a young man whom he had known,'' she said. ''Those two young men thought it would be legal under Arkansas law for a savings and loan to issue preferred stock, but there was absolutely no law on that, but they couldn't be sure.''</p>
        <p>She said that ''the young attorney'' came to her because she knew Mr. McDougal.</p>
        <p>The following year, she added another detail in an interview with the Resolution Trust Corporation, the organization created to liquidate the assets of failed savings and loans. She said that Mr. McDougal still owed the law firm money from a previous case and that she became involved because she was the most likely person to get him to pay the debt before the law firm would agree to represent Madison.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Massey testified before Congress in January 1996, he remembered events differently. He said that he was not responsible for signing up Madison as a client and he did not recall any conversation with Mrs. Clinton in which he asked her to help him sign up Madison and deal with Mr. McDougal's past debts.</p>
        <p>Other witnesses have said that Mr. McDougal had settled his debts with the law firm well before the time in 1985 that Mrs. Clinton agreed to work on the Madison account.</p>
        <p>Also at issue was a task Mrs. Clinton undertook for Madison six days after Madison became a client. She telephoned Beverly Bassett, the state securities commissioner in her husband's administration, to discuss a proposal for Madison to float preferred stock. Mrs. Clinton told investigators for the R.T.C. that she did not remember whom she spoke to at the agency. She said she had only been trying to find out who was the appropriate official for Mr. Massey to contact.</p>
        <p>In an interview with National Public Radio on Jan. 13, 1996, she said: ''Well, my memory about that is that I called the office. I do not believe that I ever talked to the commissioner. And the reason that I called is that we didn't know -- namely Mr. Massey and the law firm -- who in the securities office was to handle this kind of work because it was something new for Arkansas.''</p>
        <p>But the regulator, by then Beverly Bassett Schaffer, recalled the conversation in detail when she testified before the Whitewater committee. She said that Mrs. Clinton, in fact, had spoken with her and discussed the substance of the proposal to issue the stock. Mr. Massey, for his part, testified that he had already known which person in the state securities office to deal with on that issue.</p>
        <p>Another lingering issue the final report is likely to address is the batch of missing billing records discovered inexplicably in a family room of the White House years after they were sought by investigators. The billing records bear on two issues: how much work Mrs. Clinton did on the Madison account and her role in helping with a troubled real estate transaction known as Castle Grande.</p>
        <p>The billing records showed that she put in about 60 hours of work on the Madison account over a little more than a year. Her lawyers have said that confirms her assertion that her contribution was minimal.</p>
        <p>But the billing records show that most of her work came in a short period, and that it was devoted to helping Mr. McDougal and Seth Ward, a Little Rock businessman, develop a plot near Little Rock known as Castle Grande. Mrs. Clinton first said that she had never done any work on Castle Grande, which was termed a sham transaction by bank examiners.</p>
        <p>When the billing records showed that Mrs. Clinton billed for more than 30 hours of work on Castle Grande, she said that she had never known the project by that name. She said that the development had been known in her office only as the International Development Corporation.</p>
        <p>At one time, lawyers in the independent counsel's office fiercely debated whether to charge Mrs. Clinton with perjury. One senior prosecutor even drafted a sample indictment, but that course was ultimately rejected.</p>
        <p>The independent counsel did end up successfully prosecuting several other Arkansas figures, however, including Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, who resigned from office.</p>
        <p>F.B.I. Files</p>
        <p>Allegations about Mrs. Clinton's role in the improper acquisition by the White House of some 900 confidential Federal Bureau of Investigation files had two components.</p>
        <p>First, an F.B.I. agent said he had been told that Mrs. Clinton was behind the hiring of Craig M. Livingstone, the White House official who was at the center of obtaining the files. Second, some Republicans charged that the files had been acquired at Mrs. Clinton's behest to be used as a political intelligence-gathering tool. Many of the files were of prominent Republicans.</p>
        <p>In March, however, Mr. Ray said that he had completed his investigation and that the files had been acquired through a series of errors committed by midlevel officials at the White House. And he dismissed the notion that Mrs. Clinton had been behind Mr. Livingstone's hiring.</p>
        <p>''In the F.B.I. files matter, the independent counsel determined that there was no substantial credible evidence that any senior White House official, or First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, was involved in seeking confidential Federal Bureau of Investigation background reports of former White House staff from the administrations of President Bush and President Reagan,'' Mr. Ray reported.</p>
        <p>Commodities Trades</p>
        <p>One issue that was never investigated was Mrs. Clinton's extraordinary profits in trading in the commodities markets over nine months in 1978 and 1979. Records show she turned an initial investment of $1,000 into profits of nearly $100,000. She initially said that she had placed all the trades herself and had made her decisions by consulting a friend, James Blair, a poultry company executive whose business was regulated by the state, and studying the market in The Wall Street Journal.</p>
        <p>She later acknowledged that Mr. Blair had placed many of her trades on her behalf.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's good fortune in the commodities futures market has been in the news in recent days, but the reason was that her Republican opponent for the Senate, Rick A. Lazio, was the subject of newspaper reports about his own investments. The news accounts reported that Mr. Lazio, a Long Island congressman, had turned a $2,300 stock market investment in a company owned by his political supporters into nearly $16,000 in a matter of weeks.</p>
