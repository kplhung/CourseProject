        <p>Two of the biggest names, Gen. Colin L. Powell and Senator John McCain of Arizona, have emphatically proclaimed their lack of interest.</p>
        <p>Another widely rumored contender, former Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, recently bowed out. And the governor on whom the early speculation centered, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, is giving more and more Republicans pause.</p>
        <p>With little more than a month to go before Gov. George W. Bush settles on the person with whom he wants to share the Republican presidential ticket, the list of possibilities seems to be getting shorter.</p>
        <p>But that does not mean it is getting a whole lot clearer, because Mr. Bush is holding his cards so close to the vest that even his most trusted advisers insist they have not been able to sneak a peek.</p>
        <p>Karen P. Hughes, the Bush campaign's director of communications, said that Mr. Bush leaves the room when he gets a call from former Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney, who is supervising the selection process.</p>
        <p>''Get out a Ouija board,'' another adviser said when asked about the status of Mr. Bush's thinking on the matter. ''I'm not kidding, I'm totally clueless.''</p>
        <p>On Friday, the Texas governor told reporters that he was making progress and talking frequently with Mr. Cheney. But he also said he had no intention of divulging the content of their conversations or bringing too many people into the loop.</p>
        <p>''I don't need a committee to figure out who's best to be the vice president,'' Mr. Bush said, adding, ''I'm going to take my time.''</p>
        <p>That, of course, has not prevented fellow Republicans from handicapping the race. And some of the buzz they are generating seems to have a grounding in reality, because Republican officials, those who have no direct link to Mr. Bush's campaign and those who interact frequently with his advisers, keep coming up with the same handful of names.</p>
        <p>First and foremost among them is Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, whose aides have acknowledged that he received a questionnaire that Mr. Cheney sent out to prospective vice presidential nominees. Republican officials noted that Mr. Keating is Roman Catholic, performed well on a national stage after the Oklahoma City bombing, has a squeaky-clean image and has long been friendly with Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ridge, also Catholic, is said to be still in the running, although his support of abortion rights -- and the grief it has caused him with Catholic leaders in his state -- make him a riskier, more controversial choice. Republican strategists said that if Mr. Bush, who opposes abortion, were doing poorly with voters in the political center, Mr. Ridge might make more sense.</p>
        <p>But polls suggest that the Texas governor is doing well with independents and moderates, and would be wiser to avoid any possible alienation of religious conservatives.</p>
        <p>''The most basic rule of picking a vice president is 'First, do no harm,' '' said one adviser to the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>This adviser and Republican officials said that other politicians who seemed to be getting at least some degree of genuine consideration included Elizabeth Dole, Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee and Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska. These sources put less stock in Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, whose name occasionally gets bandied about.</p>
        <p>But they cautioned that the final pick could be someone who is generating absolutely no discussion, especially if recent history is any guide.</p>
        <p>In 1988, Mr. Bush's father took even members of his inner circle by surprise when he hitched himself at the last moment to Dan Quayle. Bob Dole's selection of Jack Kemp in 1996 also came out of left field.</p>
        <p>In many ways, Republican officials and several of Mr. Bush's advisers said, the Texas governor is freer than recent Republican nominees to let his eye wander or to go ultimately with his heart and his gut.</p>
        <p>In 1980, when Ronald Reagan selected Mr. Bush's father, who had opposed him in the primaries, he was working to unite the conservative and moderate wings of a fractured Republican party. In 1996, Mr. Dole's unexpected choice of Mr. Kemp was partly an attempt to inject some excitement into an underdog effort.</p>
        <p>''The party's united now,'' said one of Mr. Bush's advisers, alluding to recent polls showing that 9 out of 10 Republicans support Mr. Bush. The adviser added that because of Mr. Bush's advantage over Vice President Al Gore in most of those surveys, ''He's not in the position of having to throw the long ball.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's advisers and Republican strategists agreed that geography, which would favor someone like Mr. Ridge, the governor of a swing state with 23 electoral votes, was increasingly unimportant.</p>
        <p>''With the 24-hour media outlets and all the different outlets today, people can become known nationally instantly,'' said William Dal Col, the manager of Rick A. Lazio's Senate campaign, who also managed Steve Forbes's two campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination. Others added that the country's regional differences were no longer as pronounced as they once were.</p>
        <p>A more important factor to Mr. Bush may simply be choosing someone with whom he is extremely comfortable. He has said over and over that he wants a running mate whom he likes and who likes him, and while that may sound like a stock platitude, people who know him well note that he is a stickler for loyalty who puts great value on the ease and pleasantness of his interactions with associates.</p>
        <p>''That's Bush's top priority, far more than any tactical, geographical or political consideration,'' said one Republican official who interacts with the campaign.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Bush's advisers added that he does not want to replicate the dynamic between Mr. Reagan and his father, who were not that close when they entered the White House and whose staffs regarded each other warily.</p>
        <p>That concern favors candidates like Mr. Keating and Mr. Ridge, both friends of Mr. Bush's for many years. And because both of them are governors and not members of Congress, Republican officials said, they would also help Mr. Bush underscore his pledge to eradicate Washington's partisan acrimony and gridlock.</p>
        <p>To a lesser extent, officials said, Mr. Hagel and Mr. Thompson could fit into that pitch. Neither has served in the Senate for long. Both have exhibited some maverick tendencies, as their support for Mr. McCain in the primaries demonstrated. And both had long careers outside politics.</p>
        <p>''One of the qualities that Bush has so successfully capitalized on is his outsider status,'' said Scott Reed, who managed Mr. Dole's presidential campaign. ''As he picks a running mate, I believe he will be looking for someone from outside of Washington.''</p>
