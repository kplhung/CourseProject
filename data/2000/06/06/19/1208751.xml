        <p>Debbie Black of the Miami Sol crouched, her head pushing against Teresa Weatherspoon's stomach as if she were a wrestler settling into position. The Sol was trailing the Liberty by 14 points with 18 minutes remaining last night, but Black bumped against Weatherspoon and glared at her with as little regard for personal space as an annoying subway rider.</p>
        <p>Weatherspoon went sprawling onto the court, then converted both free throws. The next time down the floor, Vickie Johnson slammed into Black, who crashed to the court. The crowd at Madison Square Garden roared as forward Sue Wicks raised her arms, whipping the crowd into a frenzy. When Crystal Robinson fired a dazzling diagonal pass to a waiting Tari Phillips, and she banked in the layup, the Liberty led by 18 points, its biggest lead of the game.</p>
        <p>It seemed as if the game was over. Unfortunately for them, the Liberty players thought so, too. They missed their next seven shots, allowing the Sol to get back into the game.</p>
        <p>Clinging to a 3-point lead with 41.1 seconds left, the Liberty buckled down and eked out a tense 58-52 victory over the Sol. But no one was entirely happy with the way the victory almost got away.</p>
        <p>''We really got high off that play, but I think she was satisfied that she got us to the point where you're waving your hand to the crowd,'' Wicks said.</p>
        <p>The Sol (3-6) seemed to surge from the game's increasingly violent encounters. As players on both sides began thumping to the floor, the Sol went on an 11-0 run on the strength of 9 consecutive points by Marlies Askamp, who finished with 14.</p>
        <p>''I wore a new suit and I sweated all through it,'' said Richie Adubato, coach of the Liberty (4-5). ''With an 18-point lead, you should be able to sit back and relax.''</p>
        <p>That was the problem. Suddenly, the Liberty had trouble on offense, making one basket in 11 minutes and shooting 7 for 26 in the half.</p>
        <p>It was an astonishing turnaround after the Liberty had turned a tight game into a 10-point lead at halftime.</p>
        <p>With eight minutes left in the first half, Weatherspoon dribbled upcourt and found Becky Hammon cutting to the basket. Hammon looked as if she was going to pass but instead floated inside for a layup, giving the Liberty a 20-19 lead. Buoyed by two 3-pointers by Robinson, who finished with a team-high 13 points, the Liberty led by 10.</p>
        <p>But the Sol pushed the Liberty in the second half. Katrina Colleton, who finished with a game-high 19 points, hit a jump shot at the shot-clock buzzer to cut the Liberty's lead to 7 with eight minutes to play. Shantia Owens cut it to 6 by hitting one of two free-throw attempts. Colleton cut it to 3 with 6:18 to play on a long jumper.</p>
        <p>Eventually, though, it was the Sol's sweaty, flushed faces that were twisted in frustration. Ghastly free-throw shooting smothered the Sol's furious comeback, as it shot 52.9 percent from the line for the game.</p>
        <p>The Liberty players did what the Sol could not: make free throws, especially in the game's waning minutes, when they hit 7 of 8 to preserve the lead.</p>
        <p>With 17.5 seconds left in the game, Sheri Sam converted a shot to cut the Sol's deficit to 5. But it was too late.</p>
        <p>''It would be a shame to actually lose a lead like that,'' Phillips said. ''It was a matter of pride.''</p>
