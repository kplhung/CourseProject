        <p>The police arrested another man yesterday who they said participated in sexual attacks against women in Central Park after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade last week.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Lonnie Hopson, was arrested at his home at 8203 Rockaway Beach Boulevard in Queens about 1 a.m. He was charged with one count of first-degree sexual abuse and one count of first-degree riot and held pending arraignment today.</p>
        <p>Detective George Nagy, a police spokesman, said Mr. Hopson was recorded on amateur videotape among the frenzied crush of men who abused dozens of women in the southeastern corner of the park on June 11. He was arrested without incident, the police said.</p>
        <p>Like almost all of those arrested thus far, the authorities said, Mr. Hopson, 18, does not have a criminal record.</p>
        <p>The police said detectives were led to Mr. Hopson by an anonymous caller who saw his picture published in newspapers and broadcast on television. The figure in the picture was distinctive. In it, the suspect wears a football jersey bearing the number 20 and a thick gold chain. His hair is braided in wide cornrows.</p>
        <p>The authorities would not say what role they believed Mr. Hopson played in the attacks, saying more details would emerge when he was arraigned. Mr. Hopson became the 17th suspect to be charged. The police have released photographs of 20 other men wanted for their roles in the attack.</p>
        <p>The arrest of Mr. Hopson came on a day of continued calls for justice from the scene of the unrestrained sexual menacing and violence that rippled through the park that day, just north of the intersection of Central Park South and the Avenue of the Americas.</p>
        <p>Much like the front steps and vestibule of the Bronx apartment building where Amadou Diallo was fatally shot by the police last year, that small section of the park has entered the city's civic geography, attracting tourists, politicians, activists and the news media. It has already been the site of several rallies.</p>
        <p>In successive news conferences yesterday, members of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care and the National Organization for Women, along with the Rev. Al Sharpton, appeared near the intersection and spoke into microphones and to banks of television cameras.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharpton arrived with two women, Ashanna Cover and Josina Lawrence, who stood by the street lamp where they said they were attacked.</p>
        <p>''These women have returned to the scene of the crime,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''Today is Father's Day. We will hope that all fathers take a stand against this reckless, misogynist behavior and do what is necessary to restore a sense of security and respect to our daughters in the city.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharpton also said he would lead all-male rallies starting next Saturday, beginning with a rally in Harlem and then moving on from borough to borough. ''We need to really deal with the fact that some young men feel it is appropriate and even fun to do what happened in the park last weekend,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Two hours later, roughly 200 demonstrators arrived at the intersection and began a march to the Central Park station house to protest the Police Department's handling of the attacks. ''We are here one week from the hour'' of the abuse, said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat who represents the 14th District in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Walking in the drizzle, Corinne Hickman, a college student who had traveled from Washington to walk in the rally, said the attacks and the department's response were ''absolutely deplorable.''</p>
        <p>''It shows what society thinks of women,'' she said. ''We're either out here marching or out here screaming for help.''</p>
