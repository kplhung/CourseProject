        <p>It must be the shoes.</p>
        <p>Mikael Pernfors's screaming-red shoes beneath his tennis whites were more conspicuous yesterday than a map-wielding tourist walking not a hundred feet away in Central Park.</p>
        <p>The other men on the senior professional tennis tour tease Pernfors about his choice of treads. Imagine if they knew Pernfors's size-7 1/2 shoes were women's.</p>
        <p>''All the guys on the tour give me a lot of grief for red shoes,'' the 36-year-old Pernfors said. ''But I figure if they're going to waste energy on that, I'm going to keep on playing with them.''</p>
        <p>He did not have to expend much energy yesterday, playing a near-perfect match to defeat Henri Leconte of France, 6-2, 6-2, in the final of the LastMinuteTravel.com Masters championships at Wollman Rink. It was the season-ending event on the senior tour.</p>
        <p>As consistent as the Swede Pernfors was yesterday -- he committed just two unforced errors in the second set and took home the $100,000 winner's check -- Leconte was wild, going for big shots but watching them sail out of bounds or into the net.</p>
        <p>''Today I couldn't miss and Henri could,'' Pernfors said.</p>
        <p>Despite his distinguishing treads, Pernfors was nearly anonymous in the anticlimactic final of a clay-court event plagued by rain and marquee players' injuries and defeats. In the doubles final yesterday, Jose-Luis Clerc and Tim Wilkison defeated Gene Mayer and John Lloyd, 6-4, 4-6, 10-7.</p>
        <p>The singles final of the first tournament in Central Park was set up for a Jimmy Connors-John McEnroe showdown but instead featured two players who had never won a Grand Slam title. Pernfors and Leconte each got as far as one French Open final in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Together, they took care of the big names last week. McEnroe lost to Pernfors on Thursday and to Leconte on Friday. With two losses in his round-robin group, McEnroe left the tournament in his hometown kicking and screaming, throwing a temper tantrum on the court.</p>
        <p>Connors defaulted with a hip injury that same night, and Bjorn Borg left what he said would be his final professional event in the United States with losses in all three of his matches. Leconte defeated Mats Wilander in the semifinals on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes the Americans boo if there's not an American in the final, but I was happy to be in the final,'' Leconte said.</p>
        <p>The charismatic left-hander struggled with his serve and could not break Pernfors's concentration. ''He played well,'' Leconte said of Pernfors. ''He has a game that doesn't suit mine.''</p>
        <p>Pernfors won National Collegiate Athletic Association titles at the University of Georgia in 1984 and '85. He achieved his highest ranking, 10th, on the regular tour before knee injuries cut his career short. The senior tour has revived his competitive spirit.</p>
        <p>Pernfors said he could not imagine playing better, although it was an unexciting final. ''Today wasn't that much of a high,'' he said. ''It was an easy match. It's not like beating McEnroe in a close match. But I am very very happy. Even if these guys are not in their prime, it's such a thrill to go out there and beat them.''</p>
