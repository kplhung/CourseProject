        <p>Hands on hips, Oscar De La Hoya stood alone in his corner of the ring, stunned by the decision. His promoter, Bob Arum, leaned against the ropes and looked stone-faced into the future.</p>
        <p>According to De La Hoya, his welterweight title loss to Shane Mosley on Saturday night could be his last fight. As a surprised Arum listened after the split decision was awarded to Mosley, the 27-year-old De La Hoya announced that retirement was one option he was considering after suffering the second defeat of his heretofore golden career.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to rethink my whole game plan in life,'' said De La Hoya. who is 32-2 after losing two of his last three fights. ''I'm considering a lot of things. We all know this is a business, and a rematch would make a lot of money, but I'm not looking at it that way. Right now, I'm thinking about my health, my career, my life.''</p>
        <p>He then added: ''A lot of things go on in your head after a fight. It'll take me a few days to rethink things.''</p>
        <p>It was another in a series of classic De La Hoya contradictions, the least of which was his performance in the later rounds before a crowd of 20,744 at the Staples Center. Mosley (35-0) dominated from the seventh round on, including a ferocious slugfest in the 12th and final round, to capture the World Boxing Council welterweight title.</p>
        <p>Despite evidence to the contrary, De La Hoya believed he had won the fight by a point, clinging to the notion that the defending champion should receive the benefit of the doubt in a split decision.</p>
        <p>Two judges saw the fight quite differently, though, with Pat Russell giving Mosley the last six rounds and Lou Filippo scoring five of the last six for Mosley. Russell (115-113) and Filippo (116-112) had Mosley winning, while Marty Sammon thought De La Hoya had won, 115-113. All three judges scored the final round for Mosley. Still, if De La Hoya had won that round, Russell's score would have been 114-114 and De La Hoya would have kept the 147-pound title.</p>
        <p>''Why not give it a draw?'' De La Hoya said. ''Why take it away from me like that? It's not justice.</p>
        <p>''When you see things like this happen, it turns me off. It's tough to live with what goes on around boxing. I just don't feel I can continue on like this. He deserves it. He's a good champion. I have no problem with him winning.</p>
        <p>''It's a no-win situation. What if I do box Shane Mosley? I would not get the decision. In my mind, when I didn't get the knockout, I said forget about it.''</p>
        <p>De La Hoya had plenty of chances to floor Mosley for the first time in the challenger's career. Instead, Mosley recovered from early danger, wore down De La Hoya with his speedy attacks and clinched the victory with a devastating finish.</p>
        <p>Connecting at will with his right hand, Mosley outscored De La Hoya, 45-18, in punches landed in the 12th round.</p>
        <p>''He was flat-footed and wasn't much of a boxer in that round,'' Mosley said. ''He didn't bounce and move like I've seen him do.''</p>
        <p>In only his third fight since moving up two classes to welterweight, Mosley impressively weathered De La Hoya's power and consistently beat him to the punch, especially with quick jabs. Mosley landed 42 percent of his punches (284) to 36 percent (257) for De La Hoya. ''I was never really hurt,'' Mosley said. ''I got hit with good shots, but I never got hurt where I was wobbled. This was my time. This takes my career to another level. I just had to make sure I had enough energy to close the show out in the 12th round.''</p>
        <p>A rematch loomed even as Mosley's celebration swirled around the ring. Mosley had agreed to one before signing the contract to fight De La Hoya. Arum said he expected the two fighters to meet again in November if details can be worked out.</p>
        <p>''We'd have to consider Los Angeles; however, Las Vegas would have to be in the running to bid on this rematch,'' Arum said.</p>
