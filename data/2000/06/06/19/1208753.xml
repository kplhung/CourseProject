        <p>A US Airways Airbus and a smaller turboprop plane came within 100 feet of colliding at La Guardia Airport last week, but the air traffic controller responsible for the incident never reported it to the Federal Aviation Administration as required, the F.A.A. said yesterday.</p>
        <p>It was the second time that the controller, whose name was not released, committed an operational error and then compounded it by failing to report it, an F.A.A. official said. The controller has been decertified and may be fired, said the F.A.A. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>The near-collision early last Monday, just after midnight, between an Airbus A-320, which had just landed, and a Beech King Air turboprop that was taking off, came as air safety regulators are focusing increased attention on near-collisions and on conditions at La Guardia in particular.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the National Transportation Safety Board released a study that found that the risk of collisions on the ground between airplanes had been growing lately because of increasing air traffic.</p>
        <p>And on Saturday, the N.T.S.B. told the F.A.A. that La Guardia's rules for spacing between planes landing and taking off on intersecting runways, which allow a plane to depart as long as no large plane is within two miles of landing, do not allow enough space. The board's recommendation was prompted by a near-collision at La Guardia in April 1998 in which a landing DC-9 missed a departing Airbus A-320 by as little as 20 feet.</p>
        <p>That incident, too, was never reported by La Guardia controllers.</p>
        <p>In last Monday's incident, which was first reported in today's Washington Post, the controller cleared the Airbus to land on La Guardia's Runway 4 at 12:18 a.m., the F.A.A. official said.</p>
        <p>As the Airbus touched down, the controller cleared the turboprop to take off on Runway 31, which intersects Runway 4 at a right angle. The turboprop passed less than 100 feet above the Airbus, the official said.</p>
        <p>The incident was reported by the Airbus's pilot on Thursday, the F.A.A. official said, although the controller was required to report the incident to supervisors and to the F.A.A. immediately.</p>
        <p>The controller failed to report another near-collision that occurred on Dec. 2, 1998, the F.A.A. official said. After that incident, which was found to be the controller's fault, the controller was decertified, retrained and put back on the job, the official said.</p>
        <p>This time, the controller may be dealt with more harshly, the F.A.A. official said.</p>
        <p>''The real crime is not reporting it,'' the official said. ''If you make a mistake, that's fine, we're all human, and it can be corrected. But when you fail to tell your supervisor, that's a no-no.''</p>
        <p>The controller, the official said, ''could be canned.''</p>
