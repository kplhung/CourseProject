        <p>A push by labor unions to lift New York State's minimum wage to $6.75 an hour, from $5.15, has turned into one of the last major battles in this year's legislative session in Albany as small businesses lobby fiercely to block an increase.</p>
        <p>Business lobbyists are pressing the Republican-controlled State Senate to vote against the increase before the end of the session, scheduled for Thursday. The Assembly, which is dominated by Democrats, overwhelmingly approved the $6.75 wage two weeks ago by a vote of 120 to 24.</p>
        <p>Union officials assert that the minimum wage needs to be lifted well above the $5.15-an-hour authorized by the federal government because living expenses are so high in New York. But corporate leaders assert that raising the minimum wage would hurt small businesses, especially upstate, where pay levels are generally lower than in New York City and its suburbs.</p>
        <p>''It's the kind of issue that excites fierce support and opposition from such diametrically opposed groups that there would never be a legislative resolution until the very last minute,'' said Edwin Donnelly, the chief lobbyist for the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O.</p>
        <p>The wage issue is heavy with political consequences this year, since all 211 seats in the Legislature are up for grabs in November. Many Republicans fear that if they oppose a higher minimum wage, the Democrats and labor unions will flog them over the issue in the fall campaign.</p>
        <p>Some Republican lawmakers consider an increase to $6.75 in January to be preposterously steep and say the Assembly Democrats proposed so large a jump not with the expectation that it would become law, but in the hope that it would become a winning campaign issue. Many Senate Republicans are also unhappy with a provision in the Assembly bill that would raise the minimum wage each year at the same rate that the statewide average wage rises.</p>
        <p>''The immediate raise to $6.75 and the escalator are poison pills to make sure this doesn't pass,'' said Assemblyman John J. Faso, the Republican minority leader. ''I think this is a political gesture.''</p>
        <p>Historically, New York has not raised its minimum wage above the federal level, but some Assembly Democrats said it was time to do so because the $10,000 a year paid to full-time workers making the minimum wage was too low to support a family. They also noted that Connecticut and Massachusetts had raised their minimum wage above federal levels. Connecticut's is $6.15 an hour and will rise to $6.70 on Jan. 1, 2002. The Massachusetts minimum of $5.25 will go to $6 in January, and $6.75 a year later.</p>
        <p>''In the 1960's you could support a family on the minimum wage, but you can't do that in any guise, way or form now,'' said Catherine Nolan of Queens, chairwoman of the Assembly Labor Committee and the bill's sponsor.</p>
        <p>''We're not asking for $12 an hour, we're asking for $6.75, which is achievable. The more money you put into people's pockets, the more money they spend. So this would help the economy by generating more goods and services.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Nolan said the business groups were shocked that the higher minimum wage sailed through the Assembly, and have responded with a huge lobbying campaign in the past two weeks.</p>
        <p>Mark Alesse, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business, an association of small businesses, said he was confident that a higher minimum wage would not be approved this year, but Mr. Donnelly of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. expressed confidence that labor would prevail on the issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alesse called a raise to $6.75 ''a hideously bad idea.''</p>
        <p>''The small-business community is completely unanimous against this,'' he said. ''It will hurt the business climate and in particular the small-business community.''</p>
        <p>Contending that most minimum-wage workers in New York were teenagers, he said raising the minimum wage would do little to lift families out of poverty. Instead, raising the minimum wage would cause many small businesses to lay off low-wage workers, he said, because it could squeeze their profit margins.</p>
        <p>One of business's biggest fears is that if the minimum wage does go to $6.75, it would put pressure on employers to give raises to workers earning $6.75 to $9 an hour. Many union leaders also say that is how a higher minimum wage could help lift many low-wage families out of poverty.</p>
        <p>Several lawmakers said Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, was caught between business lobbyists who want him to stop any minimum-wage increase and Republican pragmatists who are urging him to negotiate with Assembly leaders for  a smaller increase.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno was consulting with labor, business, the Assembly and Gov.  George E. Pataki, said Mr. Bruno's spokesman, John McArdle.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to do something in such a way that's not going to put smaller business at a disadvantage, while also recognizing labor markets out there,'' Mr. McArdle said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki has said he is open to increasing the minimum wage, although he fears that it could hurt the tourism industry in the Catskills and the Adirondacks, where many workers at hotels, restaurants and ski resorts are paid the minimum.</p>
        <p>As for the increase to $6.75 approved by the Assembly, Charles Deister, a spokesman for the governor, said, ''It's certainly something he'll take a look at.'' He added that the governor thought the minimum wage was an issue that should be handled at the federal level, not the state level.</p>
        <p>The Working Families Party, a new political party set up with the support of several labor unions, is one of the main forces behind the push for a higher minimum wage. Some Senate Republicans, worried that their seats are vulnerable, are hoping to gain the endorsement of the Working Families Party, which would give them an extra ballot line. But the party has said it will look to whether a candidate has backed the higher minimum wage.</p>
        <p>Some lobbyists said that if the Senate took no action on the minimum-wage bill, it might seek to placate organized labor by approving another labor-backed bill, one that would require a day off each week for farm workers and would extend overtime coverage to them. Under current law, farm workers can be required to work 365 days in a row and do not qualify for time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours a week.</p>
