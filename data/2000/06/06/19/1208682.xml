        <p>''Sometimes it happens with no warning,'' explained the man as he emerged from eight back-breaking hours underground, rubbing his coal-smudged face.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you hear a creaking sound,'' he said of the final seconds before a tunnel collapses. ''Then you hear pop-pop-popping and you run as fast as you can to get out.''</p>
        <p>In eight years of dreary toil, the last two of them here in northern China's coal capital where he came in search of better wages, 35-year-old Jin Qian has seen cave-ins and fires and explosions. He has heard the tell-tale creaking and run for his life, and he has seen co-workers get obliterated.</p>
        <p>But far more routine, he and other miners say, are the physical injuries that can leave a worker maimed for life. They speak of broken arms and crushed fingers, of hands split by picks, of battered ribs and collapsed lungs.</p>
        <p>This is the harshest face of coal mining in China -- a country that produces more coal than any other in the world and that, its own alarmed officials admit, has probably the world's worst mine safety record.</p>
        <p>''China's produces one-fourth of the world's coal, but accounts for four-fifths of the world's coal-industry fatalities,'' Wang Shengshen, a mining engineer at the Chinese University of Mining, said at a recent conference.</p>
        <p>Zhang Baoming, head of the State Coal Industry Bureau, said in a journal article this March that accidental deaths in China's coal mines ''have wavered at around 10,000 a year.'' Those are the official numbers, which mining experts here say are an undercount and do not begin to account for the nonfatal injuries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zhang, whose agency is trying to combat the problem with intensified mine inspections nationwide, cited international data indicating that for every million tons of coal produced, China had 11 times as many reported fatalities as Russia, 15 times as many fatalities as India and 182 times as many as the United States.</p>
        <p>In China, most dangerous of all are the small, private mines that in many regions surround giant, state-run mining companies, as they do in Datong.</p>
        <p>Here, in the thousands of privately run mines, each burrowing into the thick seam of embalmed energy beneath these rolling prairies, men wearing head lamps climb down crude shafts where they use picks and crowbars to pry loose chunks of coal.</p>
        <p>With shovels and by hand, they heap the coal onto metal carts that are jerked through long corridors to the open air. Finally, it is loaded onto trucks for eventual sale throughout China and abroad.</p>
        <p>China, as its thickly polluted skies attest, makes intense use of its vast coal reserves, burning it to fuel most electric plants and factories and often even for home heating and cooking.</p>
        <p>The large state mines, some of them virtual cities unto themselves, usually give workers better job security, health care and pensions, and their operations are more mechanized.</p>
        <p>In theory at least, these mines are watched over by the state-run labor organization; while coal mining is dirty and dangerous anywhere, they tend to take better precautions against explosions, fires, cave-ins and other special hazards. But slumping prices in recent years have led to charges of scrimping on safety.</p>
        <p>The smaller mines are usually run by private entrepreneurs, who sometimes have subcontracted facilities that were originally developed by a local government. These operations, too, are increasingly subjected to safety inspections.</p>
        <p>But because the labor is so arduous and risky and these mines offer no long-term benefits, their front-line digging jobs are shunned by all but the most desperate workers: underemployed farmers from nearby counties or work-gangs contracted from distant regions.</p>
        <p>One worker in a private mine, Wang Jing, said that more than half the men in his nearby village are willing to risk the drudgery and danger because they could not scratch a living out of the semi-arid hills of Shanxi province, just below the Mongolian desert.</p>
        <p>The miners work six or seven days a week in eight-hour shifts, with no break for a meal. Each is paid according to how many carts he fills, and the most dogged workers can make $120 in a good month, miners said.</p>
        <p>In addition to better inspections, the Chinese government has begun to close down tens of thousands of the smallest and most dangerous mines -- in part because of safety, but also because of surplus production capacity and evidence that reckless tunneling on the fringes may impair the long-term production of the state mines. But some of the closed-down mines, workers here said, have secretly reopened.</p>
        <p>Resting on the large bed he shares with two fellow villagers, weary after his 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. turn underground, a migrant from Sichuan province reflected on his plight.</p>
        <p>''Our mine is pretty safe,'' said the man, who gave his surname as Zhao.  For the last four years he has worked in a private mine where 200 workers in two shifts produce about 500 tons of coal a day.</p>
        <p>''The owner knows that the mine must be safe if it is to keep operating,'' he said. ''Still, small accidents happen constantly. Doing such hard physical work at piece rates, it's unavoidable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zhao, 36, has a wife who farms and a 12-year-old boy in school back in Sichuan. Like most of his work crew, who are all from the same county, he returns home once a year during the Chinese New Year.</p>
        <p>Of his monthly wages of about $110, he said, he saves $60 to send back home.</p>
        <p>The mining work, he said, is ''really tough.'' But back in his home village, each family has only a fraction of an acre of farmland, not enough to survive on. He hopes after several years to return with savings  ''to try something different, maybe animal husbandry, growing pigs or chickens.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zhao said that when injuries occur, most of the private mines in the Datong area pay for medical care but that workers who suffer permanent disabilities have little choice but to move back home, with no compensation for crushed opportunities. And the medical care the owners pay for, he said with a laugh, is not always the best around.</p>
        <p>''When you're injured you get the cheaper medicines rather than the better ones, and you have to get better sooner rather than later,'' Mr. Zhou said. ''That's the way the market economy works.''</p>
