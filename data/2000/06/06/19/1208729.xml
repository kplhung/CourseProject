        <p>Consumers who said they would not take a drug because of the information about side effects offered in advertisements said they were influenced more by such information in television commercials than by comparable information in magazine ads, according to a study released on  Thursday by the Time Inc., at the third annual Health Summit Breakfast in New York. The breakfast was organized by two magazines owned by Time: Time and Health.</p>
        <p>Sixty-one percent of the respondents to the study, which was conducted among 1,000 consumers aged 18 and over in April, said that information about side effects in TV commercials would deter them from taking a drug, while 38 percent said such information in magazine ads would deter them from taking a drug.</p>

        <p>The study, which was presented by Caryn Klein, the director for advertising research at Corporate Marketing Intelligence, an in-house research unit at Time Inc., also found that awareness of direct-to-consumer advertising is at an all-time high, up 7 percent from 84 percent of the respondents in 1998, to 90 percent in 2000. In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration relaxed standards governing television spots.</p>
        <p>THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA  Correction:  June 24, 2000, Saturday  An entry in the Addenda listing on the Media Business page on Monday about a study released by Time Inc. on pharmaceutical ads misstated the percentage of consumers who said they had been deterred from taking a drug by information provided about side effects. Of the respondents who saw medication ads on television and said they would avoid a particular drug as a result, 61 percent said the reason was information on side effects. Of those who saw medication ads in magazines and said they would do so, 38 percent attributed their reluctance to information on side effects.</p>
