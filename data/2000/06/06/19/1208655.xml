        <p>It's easy to understand how the premiere of ''Survivor'' on CBS last month drew 16 million viewers and became one of the network's greatest successes. The show, about a group of strangers pitted against one another on an island in the South China Sea while television cameras looked on, was almost impossible to avoid, with a TV Guide cover, articles in numerous newspapers and a barrage of on-air promotion.</p>
        <p>Far more unusual, however, has been the success of an obscure Japanese cooking show called ''Iron Chef,'' which is emerging as the newest cult hit on television. Since its introduction on the Food Network last summer it has become that cable channel's second-highest-rated show after ''Emeril Live!''</p>

        <p>It's easy to understand how the premiere of ''Survivor'' on CBS last month drew 16 million viewers and became one of the network's greatest successes. The show, about a group of strangers pitted against one another on an island in the South China Sea while television cameras looked on, was almost impossible to avoid, with a TV Guide cover, articles in numerous newspapers and a barrage of on-air promotion.</p>
        <p>Far more unusual, however, has been the success of an obscure Japanese cooking show called ''Iron Chef,'' which is emerging as the newest cult hit on television. Since its introduction on the Food Network last summer it has become that cable channel's second-highest-rated show after ''Emeril Live!''</p>
        <p>It's a classic illustration of what network people call ''appointment viewing'': shows people actually make plans to watch, instead of watching by chance or because they're too lazy to change channels. But it's also an example of something new: the way cable television, the Internet and old-fashioned word of mouth can combine to propel quirky phenomena into the mainstream.</p>
        <p>Even Julia Child has expressed her delight with the show (in the current issue of Gourmet). But the appeal of ''Iron Chef'' extends well beyond food enthusiasts. Julie Yaeger, a 31-year-old vice president for publicity at Miramax (who says she is ''into the ordering in and eating out phase'' of life), for example, was channel-surfing when she was stopped by the ''Iron Chef.'' That was last September. Since then she and her boyfriend, the actor Paul Rudd, and a group of friends frequently get together Friday nights to watch the show.</p>
        <p>''Iron Chef'' is a rococo blend of highbrow and low, of culinary artistry and wrestling match vulgarity, of fantasy and practicality (though there are no recipes). What captures and holds viewers like Ms. Yaeger is the show's combination of kitsch and craft and the way it cloaks earnest competition and serious cooking in the goofiest trappings, including English dubbing that seems modeled on the exclamatory rhythms of kung-fu movie translations.</p>
        <p>The show combines Japanese formalism with American-style showmanship to create a hybrid that is the equivalent of a Pokemon for grown-ups. There is, clearly, a universal appeal in these timed contests between supremely skilled artisans who chop flesh and fruit with speed and ferocity, and with very big knives.</p>
        <p>Every week a chef challenger comes to the show to try to defeat one of the regulars, a Cooking Iron Man. (On Sunday, in a special edition taped in New York, Bobby Flay, chef of Mesa Grill and Bolo -- and a Food Network star himself -- will be the challenger.) Moments before the cooking contest begins, each chef is given a single ''theme ingredient,'' which must be the centerpiece of every course in a multicourse meal. The ingredients can be as pedestrian as a potato, as exotic as bird's nest and oat yam.</p>
        <p>The cooks, with a supporting cast of assistants, have one hour to finish. Dishes are prepared in a real-time frenzy. Beautiful and sometimes bizarre creations (sturgeon-head ice cream and frog-fish creme brulee) emerge from this on-the-spot creation of a menu. A panel of four judges tastes, comments and declares the winner.</p>
        <p>The show always opens with a quotation from Brillat-Savarin, the 18th-century French gourmet and philosopher, which appears on the screen: ''Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you what you are.'' Then a narrator briefly recounts the tale of Takeshi Kaga, a wealthy man with a fantasy ''to encounter new and original cuisines, which could be called true artistic creations.''</p>
        <p>We see the slender Mr. Kaga, who dresses like Liberace, sampling food and surveying the scene. The opening ritual continues as Mr. Kaga chooses a yellow pepper from a pile of peppers, bites into it and smiles mysteriously. ''Iron Chef'' aficionados debate whether his smile is ironic or not. Is it a smile or, in fact, a smirk?</p>
        <p>The camera pans across the Kitchen Stadium, a studio with red-draped backdrops and torch-lit runways. Portentous music throbs, as the four Iron Chefs come rising out of the stage like fountains in front of a Las Vegas hotel. The narrator introduces the challenger chefs and video clips of their restaurants, shot in the homespun style of a local commercial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaga unveils the ingredient of the week, sounds the Gong of Fate, and the culinary samurai prepare to do battle. The commentators, former Japanese sports announcers, have transported the play-by-play patter of the sports arena to the kitchen. ''Look at this, check it out,'' one of them pants during one session featuring pork bellies.</p>
        <p>Though challengers do receive free advertisements for their restaurants, their real reward is honor. There is no cash prize. The show's resident Iron Chefs aren't unseated, even if they're defeated. So it doesn't diminish the fun to discover that host Kaga is an actor (who has played Jean Valjean in ''Les Miserables'' and Jesus in ''Jesus Christ Superstar''), and that chefs are informed in advance of possible ingredients that may be selected for the battle. The show's purity transcends its fakery.</p>
        <p>From 1993 through 1999 ''Iron Chef'' was one of Japan's most popular shows. It became an underground favorite in Los Angeles and San Francisco three years ago, when local cable stations broadcast it during Japanese-language programming blocks. Web sites proliferated, in English and Japanese. Food Network bought ''Iron Chef,'' which its producer, Fuji Television Network, had translated into English, but wasn't prepared for the response.</p>
        <p>''When I first took a look at the show, I was immediately captured by the humor, and my culinary staff was transfixed as well by the food information,'' says Eileen Opatut, the network's head of programming, who is nevertheless astonished by the show's popularity. Nielsen Media Research reports that about 222,000 people watched each ''Iron Chef'' episode in May, as against the 131,000 viewers seven months earlier. These numbers are tiny by network standards but impressive in the world of cable, which reaches many fewer homes and operates with much smaller programming and marketing budgets.</p>
        <p>It's impossible to explain why some shows cross the line. ''Antiques Road Show'' -- which tours the country and features experts who appraise viewers' antiques -- has become the top-rated program on PBS, with a regular audience of almost 14 million fans. ''The Crocodile Hunter'' on Animal Planet is about to spawn its own toy line. ''Iron Chef'' isn't yet in that league: no dolls wearing chef's hats are due any time soon. Even so, its success is remarkable.</p>
        <p>Fuji Television Network, which produced the original 290 episodes of ''Iron Chef,'' spared no expense on food ingredients. The company spent $7.7 million on exotica like matsutake -- a Japanese mushroom that cost around $300 an ounce -- and electric eel and lobster (used by one chef to flavor an asparagus dish, which required the lobster to be discarded after its essence was extracted).</p>
        <p>''The show seems associated with the years of the economic bubble, and the absurd extravagances of the late 80's,'' said Jordan Sand, who teaches Japanese history and culture at Georgetown University and who discovered ''Iron Chef'' when he was living in Japan in 1994. ''Since it ran in the post-bubble years, it must be parodic. It was more funny because the dream was over.''</p>
        <p>Whether or not ''Iron Chef'' signaled a cultural response to economic stimuli, the elaborate machinations of the chefs undoubtedly harken to a particularly Japanese kind of food fetishism. ''Iron Chef'' follows the tradition of Mr. Ajikko, the main character of a Japanese cartoon series shown in the 1980's about a boy who traveled around the country challenging chefs to culinary battles. And remember ''Tampopo,'' the 1987 Japanese comedy, in which all of life boiled down to the perfect bowl of noodles?</p>
        <p>In the United States the word has spread in many ways. Paul Witcover's girlfriend forced him to watch the show the first time and then he was hooked. They've broken up, but each remains faithful to ''Iron Chef.''</p>
        <p>''Look at the cooks, the effort and the passion they put into their work; that cannot be faked,'' said Mr. Witcover, 41, who writes science fiction. ''Did you see the first woman chef?'' he asked. ''She slices her hand open and the blood is flowing. There are no doctors on hand so, they take masking tape and tape her hand, and she continues to cook. The samurai aspect rose to the core with this woman who wounds herself and battles on''</p>
        <p>Mr. Witcover introduced the show to Dan Von Behren, who works for a computer software company. ''Now I have hundreds of people who can pontificate about the beauty of the 'Iron Chef,' '' he said. On Thanksgiving he and three friends, from different cities, convened to have their own ''Iron Chef'' cook-off.</p>
        <p>''I watch N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' Mr. Behren said. ''I watch West Wing. I love the Simpsons.'' Still, what attracts him to ''Iron Chef'' is a bit of a mystery to him. ''I don't know how to describe it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Knowing how to cook, or wanting to cook, or being a grown-up, is not a prerequisite. Sam Tobis, a 10-year-old fifth-grader in Manhattan, took a look at the show after overhearing friends of his parents talking about it. He was mesmerized by the sight of a chef frying the scales of sea bass and then serving them with chocolate sauce.</p>
        <p>''It's the skill mixed with the rarity of everything that's going on,'' he said, offering a persuasive argument for the show's attraction. ''It's so 21st century. Everything is weird and different.''</p>
