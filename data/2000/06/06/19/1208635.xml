        <p>No two presidents would seem as different personally and politically as Dwight Eisenhower and Bill Clinton. But the similarities in the circumstances of their presidencies are significant.</p>
        <p>Since Franklin Roosevelt, only three presidents have served for eight years, and one, Ronald Reagan, had fallen in the polls in his final year. Eisenhower continued to be widely popular, as Mr. Clinton has today. Had the Republicans not passed the 22nd Amendment in 1951, limiting the president to two terms -- something they did to spite a dead man, Franklin Roosevelt -- Eisenhower would almost certainly have beaten John Kennedy in 1960.</p>
        <p>This year the Republicans are finally getting a payoff from the term limitation: Gov. George Bush does not have to run against President Clinton, who has already beaten his father and Bob Dole.</p>
        <p>Eisenhower and President Clinton both had to govern with the opposition in control of Congress. Eisenhower, like Mr. Clinton, moved to the center on the issues of the day, at the expense of all-out support from his  core constituency, in his case the Republican right.</p>
        <p>Each man had his vice president as his party's candidate for the presidency. Eisenhower regarded the election of Vice President Richard Nixon as a referendum on his performance; Mr. Clinton sees Vice President Al Gore in the same light.  A major difference between Presidents Eisenhower and Clinton is that Eisenhower, a world figure long before he became president, did not have to worry about his reputation.  Yet as his public service was drawing to an end, Eisenhower turned his concerns more to long-range matters than to short-term political gains -- something Mr. Clinton is doing today.</p>
        <p>A theme of Eisenhower's last term was protecting America's land heritage; similarly, Mr. Clinton has acted to designate more wilderness areas. ''There are things that must be done,'' Eisenhower told his brother Milton, things like his program called the Soil Bank, intended to save and build the nation's soil. He wanted  the government to acquire marginal land, especially in the Great Plains. Take it out of wheat, he said, and turn it back to native grass or forest. Eisenhower refused to sell off public lands or to open the national wilderness areas or national parks to commercial or mineral exploitation. Mr. Clinton has made and is making similar efforts.</p>
        <p>Another common theme at the end of the two presidencies is the pursuit of peace. Eisenhower wanted to end the arms race; he was the first to end nuclear testing in the atmosphere, and he wanted an accommodation with the Soviet Union. Mr. Clinton wants to bring peace to the Middle East and Northern Ireland, and to resolve the conflict between India and Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Today, Eisenhower's trips to promote peace have been almost forgotten. In 1959 Air Force One replaced the Columbine, a propeller craft, and the new plane could fly around the world. (When Eisenhower boarded Air Force One, it was the first time he had ever ridden in a jet.) He went to, among other countries, India, Greece, Spain, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkey, Italy, Germany, Britain, France and Iran.</p>
        <p>And he went from triumph to triumph. In Bonn, London and Paris, his landing and motorcade drew immense crowds. In India, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru told him the crowds were bigger even than the ones Mohandas Gandhi had drawn.</p>
        <p>But Eisenhower's popularity, at home and abroad, was not enough to propel Richard Nixon into the presidency. What Mr. Clinton does for Mr. Gore is yet to be discovered. But it is already apparent that while Mr. Gore wants to run on the president's  record, he also wants to set his own agenda.</p>
        <p>So it was, too, for Nixon, when he stressed that the big difference between him and John Kennedy was that he had experience in government at the top. Nixon almost made it seem that he, not Eisenhower, was running the government. But this was precisely the area in which Eisenhower was the most sensitive. The standard Democratic criticism of Eisenhower was that he reigned rather than ruled; the president wanted it understood that he never delegated the decision-making powers.</p>
        <p>So in an August 1960 press conference, when reporters asked Eisenhower to name one major idea of Nixon's that he had adopted, the president replied: ''If you give me a week I might think of one. I don't remember.''</p>
        <p>Those two sentences may well have cost Nixon the victory in what was the closest presidential election in American history. And they certainly highlight the fundamental difference between a sitting president who wants to protect his legacy and a vice president running for president who wants to build a legacy of his own.</p>
