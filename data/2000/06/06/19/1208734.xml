        <p>Vice President Al Gore plans in a speech on Tuesday to propose a $200 billion program to help low- and middle-income taxpayers build retirement accounts separate from what they will receive from Social Security, his aides said.</p>
        <p>As described by Gore aides, the program would work like 401(k) savings plans, but instead of employer contributions, the federal government would make contributions in the form of tax credits, providing in some cases up to a 3-to-1 match.</p>
        <p>Called ''retirement savings plus,'' the plans would offer tax relief for couples with combined annual incomes of up to $100,000, or individuals making up to $50,000. Mr. Gore's program would provide the greatest benefit for couples with incomes of less than $30,000 and would not be available to couples making more than $100,000. His aides estimated that the program would cost the government $200 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>The voluntary program, devised to compete with Gov. George W. Bush's proposal for individuals to invest an unspecified portion of their Social Security payroll tax in the stock market, would create a fund for each participant that could expand by a maximum of $2,000 a year.</p>
        <p>A married couple making up to $30,000 could contribute up to $500 a year. They would then receive a tax credit of $1,500, bringing their account to $2,000. A couple making $100,000 could contribute $1,500 to their account and earn a tax credit of $500.</p>
        <p>Like individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans, contributions to the accounts would be tax deductible, accounts would grow tax free and withdrawals would be taxed. Private financial institutions would manage the accounts. Gore aides say an individual who took part in the program for more than 35 years would yield about $200,000 for retirement over and above Social Security.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's plan does two things that Mr. Gore had criticized in the plan offered by Governor Bush, his Republican rival. One, it allows people to invest taxpayer money in the stock market through the account managers. Two, it greatly increases the amount of the surplus that Mr. Gore would devote to tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has been critical of Mr. Bush for devoting $1.3 trillion dollars of the surplus to an across-the-board income tax cut over 10 years. But now, with this new savings plan, Mr. Gore's total of targeted tax cuts comes in at $500 billion over 10 years, twice what he had proposed before and half of Mr. Bush's proposal.</p>
        <p>Gore advisers, in interviews today, said that the Gore plan is a hedge against what they see as the risky alternative that Mr. Bush is proposing. They said financial institutions would be limited to offering investment options based on broad-based mutual funds for equities, bonds and government securities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore intends to lay out the  plan in a speech on Tuesday in Lexington, Ky. The speech begins the second week of his three-week ''progress and prosperity tour'' (sometimes called the ''prosperity and progress tour'' by Mr. Gore) in which he is traveling to crucial battleground states to try to get credit for the booming economy. In New York last Tuesday, Mr. Gore called for a new program to supplement Social Security, but he offered only a broad outline. Details were released today in an effort to build momentum for the speech on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The retirement plan is a vivid example of how Mr. Gore is trying to take advantage of the growing federal budget surplus by spending it on  groups of voters whom he needs in November -- in this case, low-income and middle-income working families, the core Democratic base that polls have indicated are slipping from Mr. Gore's grasp.</p>
        <p>Republicans said Mr. Gore's proposal revealed a weakening of his stance against putting taxpayer money in the financial markets and would thus contribute to an overall impression of Mr. Gore as someone without reliable core values.</p>
        <p>''This week the vice president will flip flop flip by coming out for the use of tax money to be invested in the market to help people retire,'' said Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's campaign spokesman. ''It's his third position in six months on the soundness of using tax money to invest in markets to secure people's retirement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer pointed to the Clinton administration's now abandoned position laid out in this year's budget proposal to allow government-controlled investments in the markets, and then to a Gore speech in May when he criticized Mr. Bush's plan to allow people to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the market.</p>
        <p>''He's doing this to blunt Governor Bush's approach to allow people to invest in the markets to help them retire with more money,'' Mr. Fleischer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer was not the only one suggesting today that Mr. Gore was perhaps going through multiple reinventions.</p>
        <p>These transformations were among the main subjects of the morning's talk programs, as Mr. Gore's new campaign chairman, William M. Daley, the commerce secretary, made the rounds. He was asked repeatedly about the vice president's continually evolving personas.</p>
        <p>Tim Russert posed the question on the NBC program ''Meet The Press'': ''Fairly or unfairly, there's a perception that Al Gore has changed positions on abortion, on gun control, Elian Gonzalez, wearing earth tones, wearing sports shirts, wearing coats and ties, changing campaign chairmen, moving from Washington to Nashville, suddenly in favor of a $500 billion tax cut -- that Gore has no center, that he flips and panders as a politician. Is that a problem?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley replied: ''There's a problem because those are all misconceptions that have been developed by either the opposition or by media who aren't really following this day to day.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''The fact of the matter is, Al Gore has been consistent about working for the average man and woman out there and trying to address their problems.''</p>
        <p>Although organized labor helped Mr. Gore secure the nomination, its enthusiasm for the vice president has been dampened lately by his support for a bill to make normal trade relations permanent with China and his selection of Mr. Daley as his chairman to replace the ailing Tony Coelho. Mr. Daley led the administration's fight on Capitol Hill to pass the trade bill, which labor had vehemently opposed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley said today that he had talked with several labor leaders over the last few days, including John Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who met with Mr. Gore on Friday to complain about the Daley appointment. Mr. Daley suggested his talks with labor leaders had been fruitful and said he expected to meet with Mr. Sweeney on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Other Gore aides spent the day briefing reporters on the retirement plan.</p>
        <p>They said that while the chief goal of the plan would be to provide a cushion for retirement nest eggs, participants could withdraw their savings at any time without penalty for three specific purposes: to cover catastrophic health expenses, to help buy a first home or to pay for a child's college education. For most 401(k) programs recipients have to pay a penalty if they withdraw money before retirement for any reason.</p>
        <p>In addition, the plan would encourage the rate of personal savings, which has plunged by more than a half over the last decade. And they said that at a rate of return of 5.3 percent, an account for an individual could grow to $202,000 over 35 years.</p>
        <p>They also suggested that the program would be simplified by having the Internal Revenue Service create a mechanism to deposit people's tax credits and a share of their tax refunds directly into the accounts.</p>
