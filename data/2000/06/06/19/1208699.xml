        <p>The carnage was strewn all over the grass at Yankee Stadium. It was the bloodiest scene since the Boston massacre of 1978. The Chicago White Sox leveled the Yankees yesterday, piling on to what they had done to the Yankees the day before and the day before that and the day before that.</p>
        <p>Four games, four White Sox victories, four Yankees losses. The sweep ended in humiliation for the Yankees as the White Sox battered them for 12 runs in the first two innings and went on to win, 17-4. The series was reminiscent of the brutal way the Yankees swept a four-game series at Fenway Park in September 1978.</p>
        <p>That series was meaningful because the Yankees were in the process of completing their comeback from a 14-game deficit to the Red Sox. The White Sox are not in the same division as the Yankees, but this series was meaningful because the two teams could very well play for the American League pennant in October.</p>
        <p>That's a pretty remarkable statement, because who would have thought when this season began that the White Sox would be anywhere near the A.L. pennant in 2000? Did anyone anywhere pick the White Sox to win the A.L. Central? Certainly no one in baseball. Certainly no one who watches baseball games and gets paid for it.</p>
        <p>But Zachary Kram did. He said the White Sox would win 100 games (their .647 winning percentage computes to 104) and finish first. Zachary is a 5-year-old baseball fan who scrutinizes standings and box scores daily in Olney, Md. Not only did he put it on paper, when the season began, that the White Sox would unseat the Cleveland Indians as division champions, but he also wrote that they would defeat the Yankees, four games to three, in the American League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>The idea seemed preposterous at the time, but the way the Yankees have played the past five weeks, Zachary might want to reconsider that part of his forecast.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to say it's embarrassing,'' Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, said, ''but you sure don't like getting your butt kicked like we have over this weekend.''</p>
        <p>The weekend, however, was only the nadir of the extended period in which the Yankees have been a troubled team. For five weeks they have played a succession of winning teams, and they have been unequal to the task. They have won 12 games and lost 16, and this week they will play two of the teams again -- the Red Sox and the White Sox.</p>
        <p>''I'm not really concerned about what has happened,'' Torre said. ''If it continues, I'll be concerned because we're obviously going to lose ground. That's a concern. But I'm not concerned with what has happened affecting our confidence. We've gone through some tough times late in the season in a couple different years and have had to rebound. We're capable of doing that. But this is the first time we haven't beat the clubs we've had to beat for a while.''</p>
        <p>The remarkable fact about this period is that the Yankees, despite compiling a losing record, have gained half a game in the standing. When the period began, May 16 against the same White Sox at the same location, they were a full game behind the Red Sox. But they enter their four-game series in Boston tonight half a game back. The Red Sox, in the same span, have won 12 and lost 17. Another impressive contender.</p>
        <p>''If we had a team like the White Sox or the Braves in our division, it would be a huge concern,'' first baseman Tino Martinez said. ''But since nobody in our division is running away with it, there's no need to panic. We're a game out, so it's O.K. It's not O.K., but our position is all right because we still have a chance to start playing better.''</p>
        <p>Martinez and other players said it did not really matter that the Yankees were playing and losing to the good teams. The way they have been playing, they said, they could just as easily be losing to bad teams. Indeed, the series before this stretch began was in Detroit, and the Yankees lost all three games.</p>
        <p>The difference between the past few years and this period, Martinez said, is that ''when we weren't playing well, we'd find ways to win games; now other teams are finding ways to beat us.''</p>
        <p>Right fielder Paul O'Neill acknowledged that the Yankees were not accustomed to the development that has overtaken them the past several weeks. But he added: ''I think everybody's tired of talking about it. Every series has been made out to be this big world series, and I think we're tired of hearing about it.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees did not begrudge the White Sox their conquest. They saluted the Chicago upstarts as a collection of good young players, full of energy, enthusiasm and confidence. In the same five-week period, the White Sox have a 23-8 record and have gained the majors' best record (44-24) and a seven-and-a-half-game division lead over Cleveland.</p>
        <p>''They're dynamite,'' Torre said. ''They're up there swinging the bat with so much confidence. I respect what I see. It's no fun watching it because we're on the other side of the field, but they're certainly playing with a lot of confidence. What I see is familiar because we've worn that hat.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees vowed to wear it again. ''We have to go into Boston and turn things around,'' O'Neill said. ''It's a good time to get out of here. Sometimes a change of scenery can do good.''</p>
        <p>Especially when the stadium grass has turned red from the blood that was spilled during the weekend.</p>
