        <p>Joao Gilberto began his Carnegie Hall concert on Friday night in a rather agitated state, as did his audience. He was an hour late getting to the stage. Looking a little bit like Hunter S. Thompson in a pair of dark glasses, he explained that he had locked his regular spectacles in his hotel room.</p>
        <p>The rumors and guesses that preceded this simple explanation were proof of the enduring fascination with Mr. Gilberto, who has a Greta Garbo-like reputation for hermitism and perfectionism. First it was announced that President Clinton's motorcade had slowed down midtown traffic, making it hard for Mr. Gilberto to get to the show. But word got around that he was staying at a hotel less than a block away, and another part of the myth clicked in among aficionados: since he reputedly doesn't go anywhere by foot, he must have been snagged in traffic while riding around the corner.</p>
        <p>What's truly fascinating about Mr. Gilberto is the length of time he has spent working on the same songs in the same way. His first bossa novas, in the late 1950's, were perfect distillations lasting two minutes or less; the clever pushing and pulling between his stammering guitar rhythms and his voice, and the shrewd, quiet, no-vibrato blankness of his singing style helped create a languorous, innocent mood in popular culture shared by the Western world: James Dean, ''The Red Balloon,'' Chet Baker, bossa nova. Since then his recorded output has remained small. And if he isn't always playing his early repertory -- his first new album in nine years, ''Joao Voz e Violao'' (Verve/Universal) contains seven songs he hasn't recorded before -- the style of his music sounds to all but the most trained ear like a continuing extension of his first eureka moment.</p>
        <p>During Friday night's concert, part of the JVC Jazz Festival, he lingered over this slowly widening battery of songs. He has only written a few of them; the rest were composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim, Carlos Lyra, Dorival Caymmi and other Brazilian songwriters of the 1950's. But Mr. Gilberto has rather radically personalized them all and made them uniform, so that his versions are the ones you tend to hear in your head.</p>
        <p>Friday's concert offered some famous numbers and withheld others. (''Desafinado,'' ''Corcovado,'' ''Wave,'' ''Samba de Uno Nota So,'' yes; ''The Girl From Ipanema,'' ''Chega de Saudade,'' ''A Felicidade,'' no.) Unlike Willie Nelson or Louis Armstrong, two other singers who worked out comparably original rhythmic concepts in popular music, Mr. Gilberto uses barely any improvisation in his performance. It is ritual by re-enactment, the purpose of which is to arrive at a place of concentration where his tiniest vocal susurations -- his pronunciations of P's and B's, the opening of his lips to sing a line, the single word ''janela'' (window) -- become jolts.</p>
        <p>Other than apologizing for being late and wearing dark glasses, his only spoken words were requests to the sound crew to hear more bass in his voice and more guitar. His concern paid off: by the song ''Estate,'' halfway through, the show was a seance. Mr. Gilberto possesses the definition of a ''head'' voice, and much of his singing has a nasal quality suggesting a muted trombone. Almost conversationally, he connected phrases for several bars at a time; there were the slightest changes here and there, like the elongation of syllables in ''Corcovado'' and the rushing of lyrics in ''One Note Samba'' that left the guitar lines lagging behind. Positioning his picking hand above the strings, like a classical guitarist, he kept a steady bass line with his thumb on the first and third beat; the rest of his hand played syncopated havoc with time.</p>
        <p>He played a set that included bossa novas, an older samba-cancao (once sung in a 1940's croon but refigured to suit him), and George Gershwin's '' 'S Wonderful.'' Mr. Gilberto is drawn toward poems of observation and memory: on waiting for a woman (''Rosa Morena,'') his home state of Bahia (Gilberto Gil's ''Eu Vim da Bahia''), the ineffable effect of samba on ducks (''O Pato'') and humans (''Samba da Minha Terra'').</p>
        <p>It's all a long sigh, originating from somewhere deep inside. Toward the end of a nearly two-hour concert, the opening jitters long gone, it seemed as if he had found his way to that place.</p>
