        <p>After 16 hours of deadlock, the Security Council today gave a qualified endorsement of Secretary General Kofi Annan's certification on Friday that Israel has withdrawn from southern Lebanon. At the same time, it expressed concern over Beirut's charges that the Israelis continue to encroach on Lebanese soil.</p>
        <p>The council's endorsement is important because it opens the way to stationing United Nations peacekeepers across southern Lebanon and authorizes them to help the government restore its authority in the often chaotic border region.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan, who is visiting the Middle East, threatened to scrap his visit to Lebanon, scheduled for Monday, if the council declined to support his confirmation of the withdrawal, based on field inspections by United Nations peacekeepers.</p>
        <p>Some diplomats said Lebanon complained that Israel violated its border as recently as today, driving equipment across it to build a fence. Lebanon has also accused the Israelis of holding on to patches of its territory.</p>
        <p>''The presence of any Israeli soldier inside the Lebanese borders would mean the violation of the borders drawn by the U.N,'' Mr. Annan said today in Cairo. He promised to refer any such violation to the Security Council.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, the council convened to consider a statement approving Mr. Annan's certification of the Israeli withdrawal, but failed to reach consensus after 10 hours of discussions. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright intervened, organizing a conference call that linked President Emile Lahoud of Lebanon, Mr. Annan's special envoy for the Middle East, Terje Roed-Larsen, at the United Nations, and other officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roed-Larsen told the Security Council that without its endorsement, Mr. Annan would cancel his visit to Lebanon. Mr. Annan conveyed the same message to Mr. Lahoud, officials and other diplomats said.</p>
        <p>After six more hours of consultations today, the council finally produced a statement that ''welcomed'' the secretary general's report but also endorsed the work done by the United Nations verification teams.</p>
        <p>Prospects looked bleak this morning after Russia asked council members to return to consultations and seek clarification of Lebanon's complaints. Some diplomats said Russia instructed its delegation not to override Lebanon's objections. Russia wields veto power in the council, precluding adoption of a meaningful statement without its support.</p>
        <p>To end the stalemate, the French and British delegations crafted a new sentence addressing Lebanon's complaints. It said that ''the council notes with serious concern reports of violations that have occurred'' since Friday, and it called upon all parties ''to respect the line as identified by the United Nations.''</p>
        <p>Lack of the council's endorsement would not only have embarrassed the secretary general but would also have undermined the credibility of his current Middle East visit. Mr. Annan hoped to use the momentum of the Israeli withdrawal to galvanize other stalled peace talks in the region.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan, who arrived in Cairo this evening from Tehran, Iran, is scheduled to meet Mr. Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss in Beirut on Monday, and to visit the United Nations peacekeeping mission at its headquarters in Naqura, in southwestern Lebanon. He is later expected to go to Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian territories and Syria.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roed-Larsen, who supervised the complex verification process, said Friday that the United Nations mission in southern Lebanon would be expanded to 5,600 peacekeepers from the current 4,400. They are to set up fixed positions along the border and conduct regular patrols. He has envisioned an eventual strength of 8,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roed-Larsen postponed his own visit to Beirut this weekend to remain available here for the Security Council. In the course of the verification, he met regularly with senior officials of Lebanon, Israel and Syria, among other countries.</p>
        <p>The United Nations inspection teams checked the length of the 72-mile border before reporting to Mr. Annan on Friday that the Israelis had withdrawn. But within hours, Mr. Hoss asserted that Lebanese specialists accompanying the inspectors had witnessed Israeli encroachments. Mr. Lahoud separately called Mr. Annan's confirmation of the withdrawal inaccurate.</p>
        <p>The Security Council, in its statement today, called on the Lebanese government and armed forces to move faster to take control of southern Lebanon. The statement said the council would review whether to extend the peacekeeping mission's mandate at the end of July. It pointedly noted, ''The United Nations cannot assume law and order functions which are properly the responsibility of the government of Lebanon.''</p>
        <p>Diplomats said France, which contributes troops to the peacekeeping mission, wants Lebanon to assume responsibility for what has become a lawless region rather than leave it to the United Nations.</p>
