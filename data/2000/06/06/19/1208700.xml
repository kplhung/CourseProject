        <p>Much has changed in Mexico to make the current campaign for the presidency the fairest and most competitive in the country's history.

        <p>Much has changed in Mexico to make the current campaign for the presidency the fairest and most competitive in the country's history. The media has been opened up to broadcast free-wheeling debates, an independent election agency has reduced the governing party's margin for fraud, and for the first time an opposition candidate might have a chance to win.</p>
        <p>What has not changed is what opposition leaders say are the governing party's long-entrenched practices of vote-buying, coercion and doling out pork. In fact, some election observers say, such things are worse than ever, perhaps because in a stunningly close race in which so much else has been altered, they remain the party's most reliable, time-tested tools.</p>
        <p>The practices, ranging from the artful to the absurd, have been documented all across Mexico in recent days as the election, now just two weeks away, approaches.</p>
        <p>In a Yucatan village last week, the state governor himself handed out to poor women 1,003 washing machines, part of the tens of thousands that he has distributed across the state.</p>
        <p>In Tabasco state, officials appeared suddenly with disaster funds -- delayed since flooding in October -- and paid homeowners who support the governing party $600, and those who support the opposition $200.</p>
        <p>Welfare mothers and corn farmers in 13 states have reported being told that they will be cut off from cash payments unless they pledge to vote for Francisco Labastida, the candidate of the governing party, known as the PRI.</p>
        <p>At the same time, civil servants from a string of government ministries and state-run institutions like the national oil company Pemex have stepped forward to complain that superiors are threatening to dismiss them unless they campaign for Mr. Labastida.</p>
        <p>''I've not seen a campaign before this in which such vast resources have been spent to buy votes and such tremendous efforts made to twist voters' arms,'' said Rogelio Gomez Hermosillo, director of Alianza Civica, a watchdog group that has monitored 50 federal and state elections in Mexico since 1988.</p>
        <p>The PRI's tactics have provided an extraordinary demonstration of the still-robust powers of the aparato, the nationwide machinery of political control exercised by the Institutional Revolutionary Party during its seven decades in power.</p>
        <p>Recent election polls have shown Mr. Labastida to be locked in a close race with Vicente Fox, a former governor who has attracted opposition votes from across the political spectrum. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leftist former mayor of Mexico City, is running a distant third.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardenas and Mr. Fox have been trading bitter attacks, but last week the deluge of vote-buying reports so angered both men that they signed a pact to coordinate efforts to prevent further vote coercion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardenas, accusing the PRI of ''blackmailing citizens for votes,'' warned that he might not accept the election results as legitimate.</p>
        <p>Scores of incidents of voter coercion, many with an eerily similar ring suggesting a systematic effort coordinated from Mexico City, have been documented by a congressional election oversight committee, and by at least three independent watchdog groups.</p>
        <p>Some hard-line PRI leaders have acknowledged that a central PRI strategy has been to persuade officials who administer government social programs to use them to benefit the Labastida campaign.</p>
        <p>''The federal government's social programs are PRI programs, and we're going to use them to win the presidency,'' Manuel Bartlett, a former interior minister now working in the Labastida campaign, said last month.</p>
        <p>But Marco Provencio, a spokesman, said President Ernesto Zedillo had insisted that members of his government obey laws barring officials from using government resources on behalf of candidates. ''If opposition parties believe programs have been used in illegal ways, let them turn over their evidence to the authorities,'' Mr. Provencio said.</p>
        <p>A congressional committee monitoring the presidential campaign has received 86 complaints about the use of government resources to benefit mostly PRI candidates. It has drawn up a dozen complaints for presentation to the special prosecutor for election crimes, said Representative  Elodia Gutierrez, the congresswoman from Mr. Fox's National Action party who heads the committee.</p>
        <p>''The buying of votes has been flagrant,'' she said last week. But in an interview, she held out little hope that officials suspected of electoral crimes would be charged.</p>
        <p>The special prosecutor, who has had law enforcement responsibilities in dozens of elections since his office was founded in 1994, has never indicted a single person on charges of vote-buying, vote-coercion or diverting government resources to a political campaign, she said.</p>
        <p>In several recent cases, law enforcement officials in states governed by the PRI have been discovered in what opposition leaders say are election-related crimes.</p>
        <p>In Merida, Yucatan, officials at the local headquarters of Mr. Fox's campaign, after hearing noises, waited at night with a video camera. They filmed uniformed Yucatan state police officers on their roof, tampering with telephone wires. Other intruders had penetrated the National Action Party's offices.</p>
        <p>Jose Alberto Castaneda, the party's state president, filed a complaint, but the Yucatan authorities brushed the matter aside, saying the police had been investigating a burglary, Mr. Castaneda said in an interview.</p>
        <p>In Morelia, the capital of Michoacan, another state controlled by the PRI, doctors from the state attorney general's office handed out medicines, confiscated by the state police from criminals, to voters in poor neighborhoods who agreed to sign a pledge to vote for PRI candidates, according to a complaint filed by  Guadalupe Sanchez, a congresswoman from Mr. Cardenas's party.</p>
        <p>The reports of abuses began emerging in May, shortly after Mr. Labastida stumbled in the first candidate debate. To strengthen his faltering campaign, he met with dozens of federal officials and state governors to plead for help.</p>
        <p>Presidential aides said public servants would campaign only in their free time, but subsequent events have suggested that many bureaucrats responded to Mr. Labastida's call by virtually abandoning official duties to campaign full time, often from their offices.</p>
        <p>For instance, senior officials of the System for the Development of Families, a taxpayer-financed welfare agency, called its 150 top bureaucrats to a meeting during working hours in an auditorium at headquarters, Maria del Refugio Montoya, a senior researcher at the agency, said in an interview. They were told to organize gatherings with friends and neighbors at which they were to present a Labastida video and elicit vote pledges, she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Montoya's supervisor ordered her to organize one of the Labastida events. ''Do we have to do this?'' Ms. Montoya asked.</p>
        <p>''Yes we have to -- or do you want to have problems?'' her supervisor responded, Ms. Montoya said.</p>
        <p>Another civil servant to complain was Ramiro Berron, a senior technician at Pemex, the government oil monopoly. Last week he said in a public letter to his colleagues that he and other employees had been ordered to campaign for Mr. Labastida using Pemex offices, telephones and other resources, on threat of dismissal. He noted that civil service laws bar public servants from using state resources for political activities.</p>
        <p>''Your bosses are threatening to fire you, but don't be tricked into committing crimes,'' his letter said.</p>
        <p>Progresa, which channels cash payments from the Social Development Ministry to 2.6 million poor women, is the government program used most systematically to favor the PRI, said Representative Gutierrez, the oversight committee chairwoman.</p>
        <p>Carlos Jarque, the secretary of social development, said last week that his agency was working energetically to keep Progresa free of political manipulation. A letter distributed to Progresa beneficiaries reminded them that the program did not obligate them to vote for any candidate.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jarque's two predecessors resigned from the Zedillo cabinet to work for Mr. Labastida, and this spring the senior official in charge of Progresa's computerized list of beneficiaries also joined the campaign. Beneficiaries in dozens of villages in 13 states have since complained that they have been told by the program's village organizers that unless they pledge to vote for Mr. Labastida they will be cut from Progresa.</p>
        <p>In the Yucatan village of Cuzama, for instance, a Mayan mother of four who receives a $106 government check every two months said her neighborhood Progresa coordinator had called a May 23 meeting at which Labastida pamphlets were distributed to 80 women. The coordinator, Gladys Arjona, told them to put their names and voter identification numbers on a Labastida sign-up sheet, three who attended said in interviews.</p>
        <p>''If you don't, you'll lose your Progresa,'' Mrs. Arjona announced, the three women said. Mrs. Arjona, who lives in a house shaded by banana trees, acknowledged that she was host for the Labastida meeting. ''But everything was voluntary,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In the nearby town of Uman, preparations began two days before for the June 11 rally where Yucatan's governor, Victor Cervera, distributed the 1,003 portable washing machines. PRI supporters who had signed up to receive the washers were called to City Hall to make an $11 down payment and to turn over their voter identification cards to a local PRI leader. The town's 200 town workers were told that they had to attend the governor's rally or forfeit three days' pay, a municipal employee said.</p>
        <p>The night before the rally, the police blocked streets around Uman's central plaza, and municipal workers unloaded the washers from trucks, stacking them in front of City Hall. After dark, PRI squads fanned out through the town, splashing whitewash on walls painted with Fox advertisements. At 8 a.m. Sunday, the governor's convoy arrived, and Mr. Cervera handed out the washers, to chants of ''Long Live the PRI!''</p>
