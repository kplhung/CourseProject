        <p>ADVERTISEMENTS touting cash giveaways and other sweepstakes have cluttered the Internet for years, mostly appearing on search services and other high-traffic informational Web sites.

        <p>Now, though, sweepstakes are migrating with increasing frequency from informational sites to the front pages of Internet merchants.

        <p>ADVERTISEMENTS touting cash giveaways and other sweepstakes have cluttered the Internet for years, mostly appearing on search services and other high-traffic informational Web sites. For marketers, the object of the game was, and is, to compel million-dollar dreamers to fork over their e-mail addresses and other valuable personal information.</p>
        <p>Now, though, sweepstakes are migrating with increasing frequency from informational sites to the front pages of Internet merchants. Last week, for instance, buyers could register to win a trip to Universal Studios from CDNow, a BMW from Buy.com, and a trip to see a Dave Matthews Band concert from Borders.com, among many other come-ons.</p>
        <p>Often, the goals are similar to those of advertisers -- namely, get the consumers' e-mail addresses, and their consent to send follow-up missives about new products and sales. But for e-commerce executives, sweepstakes offer other, more immediate benefits, including the chance to attract new customers and keep existing customers coming back to the site. And because investors have diminishing patience for Internet merchants that use generous, if not ludicrously expensive, product giveaways and free shipping promotions to snare new customers, e-tailers see sweepstakes as a much more affordable way to achieve marketing goals.</p>
        <p>''As e-commerce companies look more closely at their marketing budget, they're shifting more and more of that money into promotions, and sweepstakes in particular,'' said Steven Krein, chief executive of Promotions.com, which conducts promotions on behalf of Internet companies. ''It's much more attractive than giving price-offs, or giving stuff away with every purchase.''</p>
        <p>Although there is no shortage of original ideas on the Web, one of the more imaginative sweepstakes offers from e-commerce sites lately is the ''Win-a-Guy'' sweepstakes from OurHouse.com, which sells home improvement supplies. In the contest, those who buy something on the site earn chances to win a week's worth of services from Lou Manfredini, who goes by the name Mr. Fix It on a Chicago radio program and on NBC's ''Today'' show.</p>
        <p>''The idea had to do with the tone of sweepstakes in general, which is that they're fun,'' said Gary Briggs, OurHouse.com's chief marketing officer. ''We wanted to do more than just say, 'Come to the site, get a free coffee maker.' ''</p>
        <p>The current Win-a-Guy sweepstakes is OurHouse.com's second such effort. The first, which ran from February through April, generated more than 100,000 registrants -- of which 85,000 agreed to accept marketing messages by e-mail.</p>
        <p>As with other e-commerce executives who use sweepstakes, Mr. Briggs has changed the campaign to fit his marketing goals of the moment. When the site rolled out in November, he said, the first contest was intended to acquire new customers, with a $10 discount for first-time buyers who registered for the sweepstakes. By contrast, Mr. Briggs said the current contest ''is more about driving people for repeat visits and purchases.'' And so it rewards repeat buyers with more chances to win.</p>
        <p>The best testament to the success of this promotion, of course, is the revenue ultimately generated from contest registrants. Those who entered the first Win-a-Guy sweepstakes bought $30 more worth of goods per order than those who did not, Mr. Briggs said. And under the current campaign, repeat customers in the sweepstakes have bought $20 more worth of goods per order than other repeat customers.</p>
        <p>Such fine-tuning and statistical tracking is at odds with the reality of most sweepstakes initiatives, said Jim Nail, an analyst with Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm. ''We've been shocked at how little tracking people do for any of their promotions,'' Mr. Nail said. ''When we recently asked about the cost of promotions or what kind of customers they generated from them, about 60 percent didn't know.''</p>
        <p>Steve Hamlin, vice president for operations at iQVC, the Internet division of the shop-by-television company QVC, said that when the site ran its only sweepstakes two years ago, iQVC did not track the success of the program, aside from logging the names and e-mail addresses of the 19,000 registrants.</p>
        <p>That will change, he said, with a new sweepstakes later this year. That sweepstakes will dovetail with an ongoing contest on the QVC network, in which announcers disclose a ''lucky number'' eight times a day. QVC customers whose membership numbers match the lucky number receive a $10 account credit, and are eligible to win cash and prizes. Mr. Hamlin said the Web site would join the contest, disclosing lucky numbers periodically and announcing winners.</p>
        <p>Integrating the two programs, he said, will enable the company to lure more television customers to the Internet. ''When we bring customers to the Web, their yearly purchases increase 25 percent,'' Mr. Hamlin said. ''So obviously, the more we can bring over, the better.''</p>
        <p>A frequent refrain of sweepstakes naysayers is that the types of people who seek quick riches or product giveaways are the least desirable customers a company could engage. But Jonas Steinman, co-founder of iWon.com, which is backed by CBS, said such opinions were baseless. IWon, a so-called portal site, has given away more than $21 million in sweepstakes cash to registered users since it started in October.</p>
        <p>''Ninety-three million out of 190 million adults participated in a sweepstakes or another game of chance in the U.S. last year,'' Mr. Steinman said. ''Contrary to the myth that participants are somehow lower end, they're increasingly reflective of the demographics of the country.''</p>
        <p>As for the buying behavior of sweepstakes participants on the site's shopping channel, Bill Daugherty, iWon's other co-founder, would not disclose specifics, but said the site's merchant partners were ''incredibly pleased with the conversion rates of our users.''</p>
        <p>CDNow, which sells music CD's online, has also found that sweepstakes provide fertile ground for customers. According to Samantha Liss, the company's senior director for brand marketing, between 8 and 12 percent of those who sign up for sweepstakes and agree to be sent follow-up e-mail messages eventually become paying customers.</p>
        <p>CDNow started using sweepstakes on the site at the end of 1997, Ms. Liss said, and now runs one a quarter. The company initially paid outside experts to manage the campaigns, she said, but now conducts all such efforts with internal staff members. ''We've got it down to a turnkey operation now,'' she said. ''We've got almost a template for it.''</p>
        <p>CDNow's promotions manager handles the sweepstakes, she said, and four other employees devote ''a couple days, tops, per quarter'' to the events.</p>
        <p>Ms. Liss said CDNow had been able to extract sponsorship fees from companies interested in using the sweepstakes as a marketing opportunity. At the end of last year, for example, CDNow ran a millennium promotion, in which it gave away an Oldsmobile Alero. Oldsmobile provided CDNow a car to give away, bought advertising for the event and paid an undisclosed amount to CDNow for sponsorship rights.</p>
        <p>Given such an arrangement, Ms. Liss said, the company's sweepstakes have become a revenue source in their own right -- an invaluable asset for a business that, like many other e-tailers, is struggling. Ms. Liss declined to say how much revenue the site had generated from its sweepstakes operations. ''I'll just say it's been a very nice vehicle for us,'' she said.</p>
