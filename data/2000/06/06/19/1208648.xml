        <p>A giant skull with red lasers shooting out of its eyes slowly descended from the top of the stage until it hovered over the audience of 20,000 people at Arrowhead Pond here on Friday night. Its bone-white teeth clattered open and shut, as an evil laugh reverberated through the arena. Then flash pots exploded, the sounds of a thunderstorm pealed through the air and -- who emerged onstage? Was it Metallica? Iron Maiden? No, it was Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg.</p>
        <p>The era of arena rap is upon us. This week what may be the slickest, largest-scale, most professional and most punctual rap tour to date kicked off in California. Full of spectacular light displays, elaborate sets and expensive short films, it had all the pomp and eye candy of a Pink Floyd concert. Billed as the Up in Smoke tour, it featured, besides Dr. Dre and Snoop, Ice Cube, Eminem and an extremely brief reunion by N.W.A., the pioneering gangsta rap band that included Dre and Cube.</p>

        <p>A giant skull with red lasers shooting out of its eyes slowly descended from the top of the stage until it hovered over the audience of 20,000 people at Arrowhead Pond here on Friday night. Its bone-white teeth clattered open and shut, as an evil laugh reverberated through the arena. Then flash pots exploded, the sounds of a thunderstorm pealed through the air and -- who emerged onstage? Was it Metallica? Iron Maiden? No, it was Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg.</p>
        <p>The era of arena rap is upon us. This week what may be the slickest, largest-scale, most professional and most punctual rap tour to date kicked off in California. Full of spectacular light displays, elaborate sets and expensive short films, it had all the pomp and eye candy of a Pink Floyd concert. Billed as the Up in Smoke tour, it featured, besides Dr. Dre and Snoop, Ice Cube, Eminem and an extremely brief reunion by N.W.A., the pioneering gangsta rap band that included Dre and Cube.</p>
        <p>The spectacle was a far cry from typical hip-hop shows, at which performers often appear onstage hours late and then proceed to spend more time giving instructions to their D.J.'s than actually rapping. Also weaved into the show were Xzibit, Warren G., Nate Dogg, Kurupt, Tha Eastsidaz and the Westside Connection. (The tour comes to the Continental Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., on July 15.)</p>
        <p>The four-hour show was a slap in the face to hip-hop detractors. For one, it let the air out of the notion that because hip-hop is a studio medium, it doesn't translate onto the stage unless the act includes a live band. None of the headliners on this tour had live instruments or even dancers. They just used D.J.'s, combined with strong performances and lavish production, which was enough to keep the audience riveted and on its feet for the entire show. In the case of Dre and Snoop, this meant a 90-minute set crammed with hits stretching back to the late 80's.</p>
        <p>The tour also blew away the notion that the hip-hop audience is fickle, and that careers are impossible to sustain. Most current rock stars would love to have the longevity of Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, who began putting West Coast hip-hop on the map with N.W.A. in 1987.</p>
        <p>In fact Dr. Dre's resurrection has been one of the most impressive in contemporary music. In 1996 his career ground to a halt when he left the violence-torn Death Row label he helped start, repudiated the gangsta lifestyle in favor of positive messages and started his own record company, Aftermath. But last year he came back with his negativity guns blazing, putting out one strong single after another, chewing out his fans for abandoning him while he was in the lab inventing hot new gangsta beats for them.</p>
        <p>Radio at the time had seemingly surpassed Dre's laid-back, driving West Coast sound in favor of more minimal, sophisticated and rhythmically adventurous beats. But Dre turned back the clock, and now, on the West Coast at least, his music dominates urban radio, through his own singles and his collaborations with Eminem, Snoop and the other members of N.W.A.</p>
        <p>A short film shown before his performance glorified all the gangsta cliches of luxury living and merciless killing that just won't go out of style. Onstage these headliners were a perfect team: Ice Cube was a masterful performer, Snoop had a winning persona, Eminem held his own as a dizzying rhymer, and Dr. Dre just stood there, proudly representing his beats.</p>
        <p>Between acts an M.C. kept the crowd entertained, at one point leading a cheer rarely heard at a hip-hop show: ''All the Caucasians in the house, make some noise!'' The audience was a mix of ages and races, which seemed to clash only slightly, as when groups of black teenagers scoffed, ''Eminem fans'' at passing white concertgoers.</p>
        <p>But on Friday night at least the tour avoided another hip-hop stereotype: that the shows are dangerous to attend. A spokesman for the Anaheim police said there were only a few arrests, mostly for disorderly conduct and drug possession, par for any arena show. The performers, on the other hand, have not been so well behaved. On the road for less than a week, two of them, Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg, have already run afoul of the law (for marijuana and domestic violence charges, respectively).</p>
