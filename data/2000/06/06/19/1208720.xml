        <p>With chants, scriptures and a moving tale of his own to mark continuity and a new beginning, Edward Michael Egan took the throne of St. Patrick's Cathedral yesterday and, in ancient rites of magisterial splendor, was invested as the ninth archbishop of New York, the nation's most visible Roman Catholic leader.</p>
        <p>Five weeks after his appointment by Pope John Paul II, the tall, commanding 68-year-old churchman, a theological conservative and canon lawyer who has been the bishop of Bridgeport, Conn., for 12 years, entered the packed cathedral in a choral procession of ecclesiastical banners, honor guards and church officials.</p>
        <p>It might have been a scene from Raphael or Titian: the cathedral bathed in Florentine light, arches within arches, vaulted stone pillars, soaring stained glass, the rapt faces of priests, nuns and laity arrayed in the vast, gray drafty interior, and at the focus a bishop radiant in white vestments.</p>
        <p>Smiling broadly, relaxed, obviously enjoying himself, he made his way up the center aisle to the basso profundo of the cathedral organ and the sustained applause of 2,700 people, including members of his family, 800 friends from Bridgeport and hundreds more in clerical garb and habits of religious orders.</p>
        <p>On the crowded altar, still in the red skullcap of a bishop, he presented his letter of appointment from the pope -- a document in Latin on parchment -- to the archdiocesan officials. It was read aloud by the Vatican's ambassador to the United States, Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo, then stamped with the seal of the archdiocese and handed to church officials for the archives.</p>
        <p>As thunderous applause swelled over the echoing cathedral, Archbishop Egan donned a miter of office, was seated in the carved wood throne of St. Patrick's and thus formally succeeded Cardinal John J. O'Connor as head of the nation's most prominent Catholic archdiocese, a 10-county realm of 2.4 million members, 413 parishes and hundreds of schools, hospitals and other institutions.</p>
        <p>''I humbly stand before each and every priest, deacon, religious and member of the laity at this beautiful service to announce that I come only to serve you, and all of the community in the three boroughs and seven counties of the archdiocese of New York,'' he declared moments later in his first homily as archbishop. ''I come with joy to serve to the best of my ability.''</p>
        <p>He recalled having served as vicar for education in the New York archdiocese for three and a half years in the 1980's, and said he had been ''continually captivated by the wonder and goodness'' of a community of faith that educated its children, aided the sick and needy, held tenaciously to church teachings and rejected ''all forms of discrimination, mistreatment and cruelty.'' [Transcript, Page B5.]</p>
        <p>The archbishop devoted most of his homily, however, to the story of a young man he met one summer in New York -- a parable-like tale of blood, compassion, riches and, ultimately, humility. At an ordination ceremony with Mother Teresa in a poor area of Highbridge in the Bronx, he said, a man suddenly staggered into the church, bloody from a beating, shouting and sobbing for help. Mother Teresa and other sisters, he said, took the man into a room off the altar, calmed him, washed his wounds and found him a place to stay.</p>
        <p>After the service, the archbishop said, a young man who had been in church approached him and asked to talk about what he had seen. The man, Jon Bokron, told him, ''I'm making a pile of money in the market, but I need to be part of what I witnessed in that sacristy.'' The man eventually became a priest and was ordained by Bishop Egan.</p>
        <p>''This is what I am coming to join,'' the archbishop said, ''a community of faith whose compassion and sacrificial self-giving can melt the heart of a young man making a fortune on Wall Street.''</p>
        <p>Two years after becoming a priest, the man died of leukemia, and Archbisop Egan was at his bedside in his final days. ''I felt his loss intensely,'' the archbishop said. He noted that the gold crucifix on his chest, worn only on the most important occasions, had belonged to Father Bokron, and was a reminder of him and of Christ. ''It is my inspiration, it is my strength,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While Archbishop Egan did not speak of policy matters or the direction his administration of the archdiocese might take, he concluded his homily with a message in Spanish, a gesture to Hispanic people who make up one-third of the archdiocese. ''You can be sure that in the coming years, I will do all that is possible to serve you as our Father, God, has served,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's investiture -- known as a Ceremony of Canonical Possession -- began two days of installation rites at the cathedral, each followed by receptions around town to welcome the new archbishop, who moved last night into his official residence on Madison Avenue behind the cathedral.</p>
        <p>Today's ceremonies are to be more elaborate and celebratory: a Mass of Installation with Archbishop Egan presiding, a procession of 700 priests and an audience of 3,500, including eight cardinals and hundreds of other church dignitaries, as well as scores of public officials and other invited guests.</p>
        <p>Among those scheduled to attend are the four United States Senators from New York and Connecticut; the New York Senate candidates, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio; Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas; Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's 90-minute ceremony was a more formal affair, a blend of solemn ritual and canon law to invest authority in the new archbishop, but it was full of pageantry and music, celebrated with vespers, a service of evening prayers, choral psalms and scriptural readings, unfolding as the day waned. There were prayers in Ukrainian, Korean, Malayalam (a language of southwest India), Tagalog, Arabic, Vietnamese, Spanish and Igbo (spoken in Nigeria).</p>
        <p>The skies were overcast and gray as the archbishop-elect arrived on the cathedral's north terrace shortly before 4 p.m. Wearing the red skullcap, and a white chasuble over a red alb, he was met by Archbishop Montalvo, the papal nuncio, and by Bishops Robert Brucato and Patrick Sheridan, the apostolic administrator and the vicar general of the archdiocese.</p>
        <p>On a day that was largely scripted, the archbishop-elect, surprising his security detail, turned aside on the steps to bless 4-month-old Amanda Brennan Hoffer, held by her father, John, while her mother, Danielle, snapped pictures. The family, from Hillsborough, N.J., beamed, and so did crowds on Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>The cathedral's great central doors then swung open and the archbishop-elect entered, taking his place at the rear of a procession of banners, student honor guards, archbishops and bishops from across the country and dozens of priests and other officials of the archdiocese.</p>
        <p>At the head of the procession were members of an intercultural council, under a banner proclaiming ''Unus Dominus, Una Fides, Unum Baptisma'' (''One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism''). Then came students carrying banners representing the counties of the archdiocese: Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Sullivan, Ulster and Dutchess.</p>
        <p>The cathedral interior glowed softly under the high chandeliers as Bishop Sheridan presented the archbishop-elect with a crucifix, which he kissed. Msgr. Anthony Dalla Villa, the rector of St. Patrick's, then handed him an aspergil, a Holy Water sprinkler, which he used to bless the procession and the crowds.</p>
        <p>As the procession moved toward the sanctuary, votive candles flickered in violet shadows on the edges of the nave and transept. Organ music vibrated against the stone and marble, and a 100-voice choir sang timeless hymns and haunting psalms in the late spring afternoon.</p>
        <p>On the altar above the crypt where Cardinal O'Connor was entombed after his death on May 3 at the age of 80, the archbishop-elect sat on a faldstool, used by a bishop in a church not (or in this case not yet) his own. He handed his letter of appointment to Archbishop Montalvo, who read it aloud.</p>
        <p>''Even as we mourn the sad passing of our venerable brother John Joseph O'Connor, the late archbishop of New York, we naturally and spontaneously choose you, venerable brother, whom we know to be an experienced herald of the Gospel and administrator well versed in the affairs of the church, to fill the vacant see of New York and to resume the interrupted governance of the Catholic community there,'' the papal letter declared.</p>
        <p>The letter was then given to Msgr. Edward O'Donnell, the chancellor of the archdiocese, who notarized it by affixing the archdiocesan seal and turned it over to the Board of Consultors, which empowers a bishop to exercise authority.</p>
        <p>At that moment, the pope's appointee became the ninth archbishop (and 12th bishop) to lead the archdiocese. Archbishop Egan then put on an ivory-white miter and was escorted by Archbishop Montalvo to the cathedra, the throne of St. Patrick's, where he was seated and welcomed by the assembled officials.</p>
        <p>Archbishop Egan's homily, especially the story of the young man inspired to the priesthood, touched many in the crowd, including Msgr. Kevin Sullivan, the chief operating officer of Catholic Charities in Manhattan. ''I think that's just a tremendous vision to encourage all of us New Yorkers to recognize, especially in a city that knows a lot of power, a lot of wealth,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Francisco Hernandez, a Mexican immigrant who lives in the Bronx and attended the service with his wife, said he was impressed with the archbishop's efforts to reach out to the Spanish-speaking community. ''We're saddened by the death of Cardinal O'Connor, who was very good to us,'' he said. ''But another chosen person is here, and he'll represent us, he'll take care of us. He is making us feel like we're part of the church and part of the people.''</p>
        <p>As Archbishop Egan left the cathedral, shaking hands with old friends, winking, beaming, stopping momentarily to thank well-wishers, Evelyn Aquaro, a retired teacher, began to cry. ''The procession at the end brought tears to my eyes,'' she said, ''because it brought forth all my Catholic background and all the teachings. I was very moved by the ceremony. I was impressed with the archbishop, his manner, and I was really touched by the way he was able to speak in other languages.''</p>
        <p>Archbishop Egan is fluent in Latin, Italian and French and learned Spanish in Bridgeport, home to many Hispanic Catholics. Much of his 43-year career has been spent in upper echelons of the church, including 14 years in the Vatican, where he often worked with the pope, and seven years as an aide to Cardinal John Cody in Chicago.</p>
