        <p>Colombians have every reason to believe the worst about their largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. It has profited from the drug trade and killed civilians. The group often kidnaps the wealthy and kills those who will not pay. So most Colombians had little reason to doubt the government claim that the FARC was behind an especially horrible extortion and bombing last month.</p>
        <p>Before dawn on May 15, armed men broke into Elvia Cortes's house in a rural area 50 miles north of Bogota and demanded the equivalent of $7,500. They placed a collar around her neck and told her that if she did not pay, it would explode. Bomb-disposal experts worked for hours to defuse the device. It exploded, decapitating Ms. Cortes and killing a local technician.</p>
        <p>Officials of Colombia's police, military and government, including President Andres Pastrana, immediately blamed the FARC. Police photographs of a desolate Ms. Cortes, wearing pearl earrings and the terrifying collar, ran in newspapers  all over the world, often with captions identifying the FARC as responsible.</p>
        <p>The bomb's political effects have been significant. Mr. Pastrana canceled an important session of the government's peace talks with the FARC. Colombians' revulsion at the bomb has led many to conclude that the government should not be trying to make peace with the FARC. The bombing provided a chance for journalists and editorialists in Colombia and the United States to revisit the FARC's crimes, and to endorse, with graphic and emotional urgency, a military aid package for Colombia now before the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>But then the Colombian government changed its mind. On May 31, Attorney General Alfonso Gomez said it was increasingly clear that the FARC was not responsible for the crime, a statement echoed by other officials. There has been an arrest, reportedly of a family member of a neighbor who had a personal dispute with Ms. Cortes.</p>
        <p>Since war has existed, combatants have sought to invest atrocities with a politically convenient interpretation. They can use the pressures of a wartime climate and journalists' conventions about what is news to manipulate coverage. The effects of the spin often remain after it has been discredited -- as it was in the case of Elvia Cortes.</p>
        <p>Reports that the government had changed its view were not featured prominently, even in Colombia. The reversal was gradual and deliberately undramatic. Moreover, Colombian reporters work in a climate of political pressure and personal risk. Many of the nation's better journalists are in exile. The FARC's exoneration was not reported by some American newspapers that had published news accounts about the incident or editorials blaming the group. Three days after the attack, The Los Angeles Times ran a passionate editorial detailing the crime, condemning the FARC and arguing for military aid. ''A FARC spokesman denied responsibility, but that's hard to believe,'' the editorial said.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the bombing, Mr. Pastrana suspended a meeting in which the government, FARC and ambassadors from most members of  the European Union were going to  examine peasant coca production.  The FARC's goal was to persuade the Europeans not to back fumigation. Since coca cultivation in FARC-controlled territory is one of the main justifications for Washington's military aid package, the meeting was important and controversial. It still has not been rescheduled.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration, which has increasingly distanced itself from the peace process in Colombia, supported Mr. Pastrana's decision. ''These barbaric acts have to cease'' if the rebels are serious about peace, Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said on May 17.</p>
        <p>Colombia's war has a long history of crimes that were not what they seemed. When the FARC murdered three American environmentalists last year, the guerrillas first accused the right. On the other side, the guerrillas were wrongly accused of murdering a prominent conservative politician, Alvaro Gomez, in 1995. Eventually military men with ties to the right-wing paramilitaries were arrested.</p>
        <p>Acts of war in Colombia today are carried out for the hearts and minds of not only Colombian peasants, but also Bogota's burghers and the United States Congress. Those who immediately concluded that the guerrillas were at fault may have lent their services to a distortion of fact that could reverberate in Colombia, and Washington, for years to come.</p>
