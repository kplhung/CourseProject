        <p>The time has come to get more people enrolled in Medicaid. Every child in New York State should have health insurance. It is a really good idea to raise the amount of income people on government-sponsored insurance can earn.</p>
        <p>Interestingly enough, these are not the quaint policy suggestions of liberal public servants or advocates for the poor, but rather plans of action ordered up in recent months by the Republican mayor of New York City and the Republican governor of New York, both of whom, not so long ago, championed policies that in some respects were in direct opposition to these notions.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose administration until very recently made concerted efforts to dissuade people from seeking Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor, last week announced an aggressive effort to find these very people and help them get signed up. It was a far cry from his other most visible foray into health care policy, when he tried (and failed) to privatize the city's public hospital system.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki, who from the moment he took office has sought to hack away the state's Medicaid budget, recently championed far-reaching legislation to help vast numbers of the state's uninsured population get coverage at the government's expense. Also this year, for the first time in his tenure, he declined to propose cuts to Medicaid. And he assured that the state's hospital system would not lose financing that many state business leaders wanted to see discontinued.</p>
        <p>The shifts in both leaders' views on health care policy seem influenced by a variety of factors. Some may be political: Americans have made clear their concern for health care issues, and both men will likely seek elected office again. Some are philosophical: the mayor's own battle with cancer has caused him to be more compassionate, he has said, and each official likely hopes that his legacy will include fixing one of the largest social problems of this era.</p>
        <p>But one thing is for sure: the bear hug they have given to public programs as a result has dazzled, if not confounded, some of their greatest critics. ''Both are giving strong public support to publicly sponsored health coverage,'' said State Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, chairman of the State Assembly Committee on Health. ''In just 1998, you would not have thought of the governor as a booster for expanding Medicaid. And in the mayor's case, he would have been actively hostile to it.''</p>
        <p>In the case of the mayor, the shift has been both dramatic and sudden. He acknowledged last week that his cancer had helped him to recognize the importance of health insurance, which 1.8 million New Yorkers lack. But it was only in April that he snapped at a health care advocate who asked him if he felt bad for pushing people out of welfare and subsequently off Medicaid, pointing out that the poor were welcome to use the public hospitals free.</p>
        <p>But last week, Mark Green, the city's public advocate, who has tussled with the mayor over every social program imaginable, including the issue of the uninsured, nearly had to pinch himself when Mr. Giuliani told him that he wanted to work together to get more eligible people on Medicaid.</p>
        <p>''If you pushed me to the wall two months ago and asked me, 'What is the mayor's health care policy?' I would have said, 'To privatize public hospitals which should not and will not happen,'' Mr. Green said. ''And now, better late than never, he has picked up one of the most important health care issues the city can pursue.''</p>
        <p>The governor did not have his own health crisis epiphany, and his shifts have been more subtle. For example, he has always supported some form of health insurance for children, but wanted a more limited program than the one that ultimately passed, a fact long forgotten by even many health care advocates. Further, it was pressure from labor unions and the state's hospitals that resulted in the generous health care financing package that passed last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's aides have said that his first years in office were devoted to cleaning up deficits left by the Cuomo administration and that now he is free to be more generous. But Governor Pataki -- and the mayor as well -- are acutely aware, said health care policy experts, that polls show most New Yorkers, particularly in prosperous times, believe that every person ought to be insured. ''I think that each of them, when presented the opportunity, has seen the advantage of health insurance coverage,'' said James R. Tallon, the president of United Hospital Fund, the philanthropy group.</p>
        <p>But here is a bit of history. In 1998, Assembly Democrats and the governor argued over how to expand Child Health Plus, a state-federal initiative to cover all uninsured children, including those whose parents do not qualify for Medicaid or are in the United States illegally.</p>
        <p>The Assembly proposed that the program be made available at little or no cost to families earning up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level, or $48,000 a year for a family of four, up from 200 percent of the poverty level. The governor favored a plan that kept the income eligibility level where it was, leaving out more than 200,000 children. In the end, the wage ceiling was lifted and thousands more children enrolled, and Mr. Pataki later appeared in television advertisements, surrounded by children, boasting about the program.</p>
        <p>''It took a lot of beating up by the Children's Defense Fund,'' Mr. Gottfried said. ''And once it got passed, he became the world's biggest booster.I think what that proves is that the issue of the uninsured has enormous political potency.''</p>
        <p>Last December, Mr. Pataki incurred the wrath of many conservatives by agreeing to renew a state program that pays hospitals about $1.3 billion a year to train new doctors and treat poor people who cannot pay for care. Added to that program was free health insurance for entire families earning up to 150 percent of the federal poverty line. The program, called Family Health Plus, will cost nearly $600 million in state and federal money, subsidized in part by something else few thought Mr. Pataki would ever agree to -- a 55-cent-a-pack tobacco tax increase.</p>
        <p>Hospital executives, who had been gearing for a long battle with Mr. Pataki and who were gnashing their teeth in the months leading up the agreement, cannot stop praising the governor today. ''We have a very favorable arrangement with him,'' said Dr. John W. Rowe, chief executive of Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. ''He has been particularly responsive as hospitals have experienced more stress.''</p>
        <p>Then, there is the mayor. Just last year, state investigators posing as poor people seeking Medicaid discovered that workers in city welfare offices failed to provide Medicaid applications to eligible people. And as part of getting people off welfare rolls, many who were nonetheless eligible for Medicaid were discouraged from trying to obtain benefits, causing the number of beneficiaries to drop substantially in recent years.</p>
        <p>But under the mayor's new plan, the city's schools, hospitals, food stamp offices, police station houses and others would work to help enroll more than 900,000 people eligible for government health insurance who are not now covered. The program would direct eligible poor people into either Medicaid or Child Health Plus or Family Health Plus, which is expected to start in January 2001.</p>
        <p>Asked last week if he had experienced a major shift in his thinking on this issue, Mr. Giuliani said, ''I don't think it's a major shift.''</p>
        <p>''I think we've always tried to do a great deal for the uninsured,'' he said, citing a city program, Health Pass, intended to help small businesses get employees enrolled. A smaller version of that program, which forced people to use public hospitals in exchange for low-premium insurance, failed. ''I think we were thinking too small,'' Mr. Giuliani added.</p>
        <p>The mayor also once blocked a program for children with asthma, largely because one of its administrators, Dr. Irwin Redlener, the president of the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, publicly questioned some of its components. Suddenly, Dr. Redlener said, the grant disappeared. ''It has been hard to look at his record and say this was an administration that cared about health care access,'' Dr. Redlener said. ''Today, we are looking at a sea change in attitude and responsibility.''</p>
        <p>The mayor's program will certainly not solve the entire problem of the uninsured. Many uninsured people work and do not qualify for the program. And letting people know they are eligible is only a small part of getting people enrolled in Medicaid, health care experts say. The enrollment process, between its exhaustive application and financial investigations, needs more work than public awareness, they assert.</p>
        <p>But even those who criticized the mayor as recently as a month ago are thrilled with the step. ''This is a tremendously positive step,'' Dr. Redlener said. ''I think that it is important for people like me to not only applaud what he is doing but to pledge full cooperation.''</p>
