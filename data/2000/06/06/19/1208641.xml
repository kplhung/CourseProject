        <p>CONVERTING the loose change on the bedroom dresser into ''real money'' is probably on the bottom of most people's ''to do'' lists, right up there with organizing the sock drawer.</p>
        <p>But a new campaign for Coinstar, the nation's largest manufacturer of self-service coin-counting machines, seeks to reverse those sentiments by using humor to exhort consumers to dump the contents of their piggy banks into the company's machines and become empowered by their ''new found'' money.</p>
        <p>The $10 million brand-building TV campaign is the first for Coinstar by the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of the Omnicom Group since the agency's office in Playa del Rey, Calif., was awarded the account in November.</p>
        <p>''The new Coinstar campaign represents a notable evolution, both strategically and creatively, from previous advertising efforts,'' said Rich Stillman, vice president for marketing at Coinstar in Bellevue, Wash.</p>
        <p>''In the past, our ads focused on the rational benefits of our service, such as convenience and ease of use. To better connect with consumers the new ads are designed to strike an emotional chord, conveying a brand personality for Coinstar that is human, empathetic, inspiring and fun.''</p>
        <p>Coinstar estimates that two-thirds of Americans accumulate on average over $600 worth of change every year. Research found, however, that only about 12 percent have ever tried using the Coinstar service.</p>
        <p>''So, our main strategy is to build awareness and trial of our service,'' Mr. Stillman said, asserting that ''125 million Americans live within two miles of a Coinstar machine.''</p>
        <p>The bright green and purple self-service coin-counting machines are in more than 7,500 groceries nationwide, including Albertson's, Food Emporium, Kroger and Safeway. The machine is a PC that counts coins and reimburses consumers after subtracting an 8.9 percent fee for the service, with the supermarkets collecting 1 percent of that. In addition, the machine issues vouchers and dispenses discount coupons from other marketers.</p>
        <p>Coinstar's research found that the predominate experience when using its machine is that most customers go into a supermarket with a jar of coins expecting to collect $25 to $30, but have severely underestimated how much money they actually have.</p>
        <p>''The feeling that people get is a little bit like winning the lottery,'' Mr. Stillman said. ''It's just a fun experience. And that was the part we wanted to capture.''</p>
        <p>Two 30-second humorous television commercials demonstrate how coins can be changed into something useful in unusual ways by featuring everyday situations and exaggerating them for effect into ''what if'' situations.</p>
        <p>For instance, one spot, which unfolds the story without dialogue, features a 12-year-old boy sauntering down a city sidewalk when two older boys torment him by tossing coins at him from a second-story window. Day in and day out the boy simply picks up the coins without missing a beat. The spot then cuts to the tormented boy at a Coinstar machine converting a large jar of coins. As an announcer states, ''Turn your change into something useful,'' the two bullies are shown hanging out the tenement window waiting to throw coins at the boy when they hear ''Beep. Beep. Beep.'' As a shadow appears, they look down to the street and see the younger boy operating a wrecking ball he has rented to get revenge.</p>
        <p>A second commercial features a waitress in a cocktail lounge dealing with a troublesome regular customer played by the character actor Mike Hagerty, who is known for bit parts on television shows that include ''Friends.'' In the spot, the heavyset sleazy businessman comes in daily for a beer and harasses the waitress. He cheaply tips her by placing coins in the front pocket of her apron, invading her personal space at the same time. After suffering the final indignity of a slap on the buttocks, the waitress visits the Coinstar machine. The next night as the customer places his hand in the waitress's apron his fingers are zapped. The scene then cuts to the waitress putting her newly purchased Stun King stun gun in her locker. The spot was unscripted with the dialogue ad-libbed by Mr. Hagerty.</p>
        <p>Both spots end with the announcer stating the tagline, ''Coinstar. How much do you have?''</p>
        <p>''Hopefully, the campaign will get people to start looking at that change as being a lot more than what they think it is and here's an easy way to get rid of it and get cash for it,'' Jerry Gentile, managing partner and creative director at TBWA/Chiat/ Day.</p>
        <p>Using humor as a vehicle is certainly not unusual for TBWA/Chiat/ Day, which is known for work that entertains, in particular its campaigns for longtime clients like Energizer, Nissan and Taco Bell. The Coinstar effort is yet another campaign to fall into Madison Avenue's long-running, contentious debate over just how effective humorous advertising is in peddling products.</p>
        <p>''I just think that people's lives are just constantly being bombarded with stuff, and I think you have got to find a way that doesn't strangle people with messages,'' Mr. Gentile said.</p>
        <p>''I think the key with something like this, when it's a low interest product -- something you don't think about everyday -- you have to bring something to it to put a little more importance or a little more interest in the subject,'' he added. ''I think humor seems to be universal. It just seemed like an obvious way to go.''</p>
        <p>The spots began running last month in 12 markets, including Chicago, Denver, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington. Coinstar will add additional markets later this year while three radio commercials, with a similar creative format, began running this month.</p>
