        <p>The sleeper of the dance season may well be ''Harmonielehre,'' Peter Martins's new ballet set to John Adams's music of the same title. Mr. Adams, who was welcomed with a burst of applause as he stepped into the pit, conducted his own score for the New York City Ballet on Saturday night at the New York State Theater.</p>
        <p>It was a festive occasion, an all-Adams program that included four earlier Martins works set to this composer's music. Mr. Adams, who took a bow after the premiere, returned at the end to gesture in appreciation to the orchestra, conducted during the rest of the evening by Maurice Kaplow and Richard Moredock.</p>
        <p>As the eighth premiere in City Ballet's Diamond Project, ''Harmonielehre'' seems to have crept up late in the season as an unexpected major effort. Suggestive of a cosmic allegory, it may also strike some as a high-art ''Fantasia.'' Yet as a highly acclaimed American composer, Mr. Adams has often acknowledged an openness to popular influences on his classical roots and post-Minimalist aesthetic.</p>
        <p>What is clear is that Mr. Martins's ballet is an ambitious work full of startling images that take off imaginatively from the composer's ideas.</p>
        <p>One of the surprises is the combination of Mark Stanley's richly nuanced lighting and Alain Vaes's striking backdrops. The overall atmosphere resonates with echoes of nature's turbulence: muddy canyons and purple galaxies seen first from the sky and then the earth.</p>
        <p>The choreography has its own strange fascination, with Mr. Martins's use of insistent motifs. There is a woman who dances mainly through bourrees. Another is constantly manipulated by two men, and a teenager is carried on a man's shoulder and rarely sets her bare foot on the floor.</p>
        <p>The City Ballet's aesthetic, as promoted by George Balanchine, is to use music as a springboard for dance. Balanchine was once accused of merely visualizing the music by having dancers and patterns onstage illustrate the structure of a score. Balanchine's genius, however, was to add a dimension to the music that in fact illuminated the music. This is the truism that has been repeated for 60 years about Balanchine's work. It should never be forgotten. Balanchine knew that music is transformed by dance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martins is his most faithful disciple in this respect. One has only to read Mr. Adams's comment in the company's current Stagebill to gauge the effect of City Ballet's approach. Referring to the fast tempo Mr. Martins gave to his music in the 1990 ballet ''Fearful Symmetries'' (which closed Saturday's program with especially swift and brilliant dancing), Mr. Adams says: ''When I first heard 'Fearful Symmetries' at City Ballet, I was shocked. But I understood why they'd done it. It's a splendid piece of choreography.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams's comments elsewhere, on the recording of his 1985 ''Harmonielehre,'' translate the title as a treatise on harmony, referring to a book by Arnold Schoenberg. Mr. Adams sees his score in part as a parody of Schoenberg ''without the intent to ridicule.'' The virgin ear might hear various influences, but Mr. Martins has played especially with the lyricism that is in dialogue with the music's energetic pulse.</p>
        <p>Some of the not-so-hidden scenario, however, comes directly from Mr. Adams's ideas, powered by dreams. Interested in Jung's writings, he calls the second of the score's three movements ''The Anfortas Wound,'' referring to Jung's tale of a king whose wounds cannot heal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martins's second section is thus a literally dark passage, with Darci Kistler, in a white striped leotard, carried and maneuvered between Jock Soto and Charles Askegard, who wear slit black velvet skirts and patterned black tops (costumes by Mr. Vaes).</p>
        <p>Partnering Ms. Kistler in turn or whirling around like evil birds, they symbolize a sickness of the soul that is nonetheless cured when Edward Liang and Adam Hendrickson, functioning like two good spirits, restore Ms. Kistler from a spiritual death.</p>
        <p>Mr. Liang and then Mr. Hendrickson, announced by a burst of trombones and chimes, had opened the ballet with their diagonals of fast, high leaps and introduced eight men in green and their partners on toe. The first section is the best, a cascade of dances close to the music's rhythmic texture. The patterns are circular.</p>
        <p>Amid this whirlwind energy, echoed in the rivers of the topographical backdrop, Janie Taylor floats with her bourrees in a quiet duet with Jared Angle to a sustained lyrical passage in the music.</p>
        <p>She, too, is occasionally manipulated by her partner. This is not a ballet with extended dancey phrases. There are instead turns, twists and tangled partnering, seen in the ensemble that bursts in again before the darker second movement, danced in front of a black backdrop.</p>
        <p>This hell is replaced at the beginning of the third movement by a childlike vision of heaven: pale blue chiffon drapes and dresses for barefoot women with loose hair. Mr. Adams had a dream about his infant daughter's being carried on the shoulder of a medieval mystic. James Fayette carries Ashlee Knapp, a 13-year-old student from the School of American Ballet. He shifts his weight and she tumbles around his body. The image is odd and striking, leading into an even more unexpected swirl of dancers and music as a galaxy lights up the background.</p>
        <p>By comparison with the rest of the program, which included ''The Chairman Dances,'' ''Todo Buenos Aires'' and ''Slonimsky's Earbox,'' a ballet like ''Harmonielehre'' is strange, in the best sense.</p>
