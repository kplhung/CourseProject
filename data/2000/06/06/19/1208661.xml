        <p>SDOON, perhaps within days, researchers expect to announce completion of the decade-long project to map the human genome.</p>
        <p>If you hadn't already been paying attention, both BusinessWeek and The New Yorker recently produced major articles on J. Craig Venter, the scientist-entrepreneur who broke from the public science orthodoxy a few years ago and started a commercial race to finish the treasure map. (BusinessWeek, in its captain-of-industry feature, declared a ''genome gold rush'' and explained its election of Mr. Venter to cover-photo status this way: ''Well, Craig, you've earned it.'')</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Venter's enterprise, the Celera Genomics group of the PE Corporation, finishes first, or whether the $3 billion publicly financed, international Human Genome Project somehow wins at the wire, completion will be a significant milestone -- not only for molecular biology, but for computer science. And for business, of course. Stand by for the New Genomics to become the next big thing in the New Economics.</p>
        <p>Aided by extensive computer processing power, the genome researchers have been engaged in what is essentially a giant software project. Sequencing the human genome, as the task is known, involves sifting through the three billion units of DNA at the heart of every human cell to identify the 80,000 or so genes that define all inheritable physical and behavioral traits. This identification process is not the same as decoding, however. For even after all those genes have been identified, each one still needs to be translated to determine its meaning.</p>
        <p>Think of each gene as a snatch of encrypted software -- a set of instructions that tells cells which proteins to produce in order to make, repair or regulate some part of the human body. To researchers, each gene initially seems like a piece of encrypted e-mail. Simply knowing that there's a gene in the In Box isn't enough; somebody has to unscramble the code to understand what the gene actually means.</p>
        <p>So this first phase is only a starting point. But eventually, sequencing the human genome is expected to give medical researchers the knowledge to devise new techniques for diagnosing, treating and even preventing all sorts of diseases in which genetic differences play a role -- whether purely physical afflictions like cancer or mentally manifested ones like schizophrenia.</p>
        <p>Already, some useful data has emerged from this effort, as the mappers have published various gene sequences -- the coded text of individual genes. An early leader in translating genomic data into actual drugs is Human Genome Sciences, a Rockville, Md., company that is currently in human trials with two gene-based therapies. One is meant to protect the body's blood-forming cells during cancer chemotherapy; the other is being tested as a wound-healing agent.</p>
        <p>How soon these, or other gene therapies, might reach the market is hard to predict. But the business and investing worlds, eager to find the next hot market, are prepared to celebrate the gene kings in the same way they've feted the Internet titans.</p>
        <p>It was no accident that the chairman and chief executive of Human Genome Sciences, William A. Haseltine, recently shared a stage with Steve Case, chairman of America Online, at a dinner held by the prestigious Economic Club of New York. The organizers, presumably, have already figured out that the New Economics and the New Genomics are adjacent steps on technology's ever-ascending spiral staircase.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haseltine allowed as much. After Mr. Case delivered a speech about the Net as ''a massive social phenomenon,'' Mr. Haseltine took the podium and said, ''I couldn't do the work I do today without the advances that have been made in computation.''</p>
        <p>And then Mr. Haseltine, speaking without notes, laid out a number of issues in genomics that -- even if he didn't explicitly draw the parallels -- have their computing and Internet counterparts.</p>
        <p>He referred to the harnessing of genes and proteins as a new medicine, whose benefits he described in new-economic terms as ''a new and scalable form of productivity.'' He spoke of the public-policy goal of ensuring a ''uniform access to the new medicine,'' a phrase resonant with the goals of digital-divide advocates who seek equal Internet access for all.</p>
        <p>And making clear that, whether the code is digital or genetic, business is business, Mr. Haseltine argued that ''protection of intellectual property in its multiple forms is crucial.'' In this newest chapter of the information age, the data continues to have intrinsic value.</p>
        <p>A reason Mr. Venter and Celera hurried to complete their own human genome database was so they could sell that information to other researchers. Likewise, Mr. Haseltine, a former business partner of Mr. Venter's, has sought to stake a commercial claim by patenting his company's gene work. So far Human Genome Sciences has applied for more than 7,500 human-gene patents and has been granted more than 130.</p>
        <p>To his Economic Club audience, Mr. Haseltine patiently explained that gene patents make no ownership claim on each individual's personal DNA chemistry. The patents, he said, cover only specific, applied knowledge about human genes. He said such knowledge resulted from considerable money and effort, which would not be expended without the lure of a commercial payoff.</p>
        <p>It all sounded reasonable. And it sounded like the same capitalism that has long driven advances in the software industry.</p>
        <p>As it happens, Mr. Haseltine addressed the Economic Club only a few hours after a federal judge ordered the breakup of Microsoft. Is it irony, or symmetry, that genomics is reaching its big milestone at the same historic moment that the government wants to break up the world's most powerful software company?</p>
        <p>Microsoft is being censured for the way it has wielded market power over the desktop operating system. Will some other company, someday, be investigated for its market power over the genome -- the basic human operating system?</p>
        <p>The one certainty is that the gold rush is on. BusinessWeek says so. And now, any Nasdaq investor who saw selling pet food over the Internet as the apotheosis of technology should get ready: Be prepared to gaze in slack-jawed wonder at what computers and DNA software compilers are about to let us in for.</p>
