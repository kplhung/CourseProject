        <p>MANHATTAN: APPLE TOURS CRITICIZED  The city's Consumer Affairs Department has accused New York Apple Tours of lying to customers since the bus company was ordered off the road. The department said Friday that Apple Tours employees have told tourists that Apple Tours was the same company as New York Double Decker Buses. Double Decker is a separate company. It agreed to honor Apple Tours tickets sold before the May 31 suspension of Apple Tours' license. The president of Apple Tours, Hayim Grant, above, denied the charge.</p>

        <p>FALLSBURG: PRISONER MOVED  Arthur Shawcross, a serial killer who spent the last nine months in solitary confinement for selling artwork on the Internet, is back in the general prison population. Mr. Shawcross, who was convicted of killing 11 Rochester-area women a decade ago, was released Saturday from solitary confinement at Sullivan Correctional Facility, where he is serving 250 years to life. Mr. Shawcross created art and signed autographs and gave the items to friends outside prison, who sold them on eBay, an Internet auction site. In return, the friends said they would buy Mr. Shawcross items he needed.</p>

        <p>BRIDGEPORT: CHARITABLE GIFTS QUESTIONED  A state organization that raises money for charity from state employees is being criticized again. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport and the New York-based Catholic League are upset that Catholics for a Free Choice, which supports several causes contrary to church doctrine, is one of the groups eligible for money from the organization, the Connecticut State Employees' Campaign for Charitable Giving. The campaign has also been criticized for dropping the Boy Scouts of America.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: DIETARY LAWS  New Jersey is poised to become the first state to enact a law regulating the sale of food prepared under Muslim dietary laws. The bill, which passed the State Legislature unanimously, would put New Jersey at the head of efforts to place Islam on an equal legal footing with Christianity and Judaism, The Star-Ledger in Newark reported yesterday. The New Jersey bill offers protection from pricing fraud and requires producers to follow the rules. The bill is headed to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman for signing.</p>

        <p>HACKENSACK: FASTER TOLLS  Tollbooths will be removed in the E-ZPass-only lanes at the George Washington Bridge's lower level and at the toll plaza from the Palisades Interstate Parkway. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said the change was a first step toward allowing E-ZPass users to go through toll checkpoints at highway speeds, The Record in Hackensack reported yesterday. Toll scanners would be mounted above the lane, the newspaper reported. Such a system would permit E-ZPass users to drive through without slowing to 5 miles per hour, as they have to now.</p>
