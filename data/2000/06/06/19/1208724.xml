        <p>It's 6,000 miles from here to St. Andrews, the auld gray toon in Scotland where golf grew up. But when Tiger Woods strode off Pebble Beach as the United States Open champion, it seemed as if he were already marching to the first tee at St. Andrews, where the British Open and a career Grand Slam are waiting.</p>
        <p>His opportunity for an ''Open double'' was all most people had to look forward to today as he shot a smooth 67 to dominate the 100th United States Open by a record 15 strokes with a record 12-under-par 272 total. After that dazzling performance, some observers are all but conceding him the British Open, which begins July 20.</p>

        <p>It's 6,000 miles from here to St. Andrews, the auld gray toon in Scotland where golf grew up. But when Tiger Woods strode off Pebble Beach as the United States Open champion, it seemed as if he were already marching to the first tee at St. Andrews, where the British Open and a career Grand Slam are waiting.</p>
        <p>His opportunity for an ''Open double'' was all most people had to look forward to today as he shot a smooth 67 to dominate the 100th United States Open by a record 15 strokes with a record 12-under-par 272 total. After that dazzling performance, some observers are all but conceding him the British Open, which begins July 20.</p>
        <p>''If Tiger doesn't win at St. Andrews, there should be a stewards' inquiry,'' said Sir Michael Bonallack, the recently retired ruler of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, which governs the British Open. ''He can drive it over all the bunkers on his tee shots, he has a great short game and he's a great putter.''</p>
        <p>Bonallack's opinion should be respected. Before he was the world's most influential golf administrator, he was arguably Britain's best amateur of the 20th century, a five-time British Amateur champion.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing how different the wind can be at St. Andrews,'' Woods said. ''On the first hole at the 1998 Dunhill Cup matches there, I hit a 2-iron and a sand wedge one day, a driver and 4-iron the next day. And there are bunkers there that you never see until the wind changes; the genius involved in designing a course like that.''</p>
        <p>He is also aware that winning at St. Andrews would complete his career Grand Slam.</p>
        <p>''We all knew that if there were any two tournaments to win the Grand Slam on, it would be these two venues,'' Woods said. ''It doesn't get any better than this -- Pebble Beach and St. Andrews, and there's no better site to have it occur than the home of golf. That's where it all started. To get that claret jug would be a good feeling.''</p>
        <p>In those 1998 Dunhill Cup matches, he shot 66, 70, 66, 72, a total of 14 under par. But that was in November. In July, the fairways there will be firmer, the greens harder.</p>
        <p>If the prevailing wind blows at St. Andrews, Woods will be driving the green on three of the par-4 holes -- No. 9, No. 12 and No. 18, which is in the shadow of both the R. and A.'s gray stone clubhouse and the shop of Old Tom Morris, the legendary pro there. If there is no wind, he will also drive the green on No. 10.</p>
        <p>Old Tom Morris, incidentally, held the previous record for the largest winning margin in a major championship, 13 strokes in the 1862 British Open at Prestwick.</p>
        <p>And if Woods wins the British Open, he will be the youngest golfer to have completed the career Grand Slam. He's 24. Jack Nicklaus was 26 when he completed his career slam with the 1966 British Open at Muirfield.</p>
        <p>Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Gene Sarazen are the only others to have achieved the career Grand Slam by winning the Masters, the United States Open, the British Open and the Professional Golfers Association Championship. Woods won the Masters in 1997 and the P.G.A. last year at Medinah No. 3 outside Chicago.</p>
        <p>For Woods even to be within the British Open of a career Grand Slam in his fourth full season on the pro tour testifies to his dominance over the last 13 months with 13 tournament victories (five this year) on the PGA Tour and in Europe, a remarkable average of one a month.</p>
        <p>''He's been more dominating over this period,'' Nicklaus has said, ''than I ever was over any similar period of time.''</p>
        <p>Woods is so much more than just the world's hottest golfer for a few months, as David Duval was early last year, as so many others have been over the years. If he doesn't win, he's almost always in the hunt.</p>
        <p>For those awed by his distance off the tee, don't forget that of today's pros he has the best short game. He's the best putter, the best thinker, the best competitor. The tougher the tension, the better he plays.</p>
        <p>He's never satisfied. Even with a big lead, when he hooked his tee shot on the 18th in the second round onto the rocks of Carmel Bay, he uttered expletives that were heard on television. He later apologized.</p>
        <p>For all his length, he won this Open with the accuracy of his tee shots into the fairway and his putting.</p>
        <p>He's the Microsoft of golf. If the other pros could find a judge who would split him in two, they would.</p>
        <p>''Tiger is playing better than he ever has,'' his swing guru, Butch Harmon, said before his par 71 for a 10-stroke lead on Saturday. ''He's confident. He's mature. We've built his swing together, so it's pretty easy to tweak if something goes wrong. If he plays good golf, he's going to win.''</p>
        <p>Woods took charge of this Open during his opening-round 65, which featured five par-saving putts, each at a missable distance.</p>
        <p>''Those 8-foot or 10-foot par-saving putts,'' Wood said, ''making them makes you feel better than you do when you make a birdie.''</p>
        <p>But that virtually perfect putting stroke wasn't an accident. Early in the week, he wasn't satisfied with his putting stroke.</p>
        <p>''Since I got here,'' he said after the first round, ''my stroke hasn't been as comfortable as I'd like to have it. I was making putts, but there are certain ways of making putts. Either they go in properly or you just kind of scoot them in. I didn't like the way I was rolling the ball.</p>
        <p>''I was making quite a few putts in the practice rounds, but the ball wasn't turning over the way I like to see it roll. I found that my posture was a little off, my release wasn't quite right. I just needed to get some reps in. Once I get enough reps, I feel a little more comfortable.''</p>
        <p>He had the ball turning over the way he likes to see it roll; that's how fine a distinction Tiger Woods makes in analyzing his putting stroke. Just another reason why he's now going to St. Andrews for the career Grand Slam.</p>
