        <p>Orlando Hernandez trudged a few feet behind the mound, allowed a new ball to tumble out of his glove and crouched like a catcher. El Duque stared at the grass below his cleats for about 10 seconds that felt more like 10 minutes. Hernandez looked uncomfortable. Everyone on the Yankees felt uneasy, too.</p>
        <p>Jose Valentin had just smashed a grand slam and the Chicago White Sox had nine runs in the first inning when Hernandez dropped the ball, lowered his head and waited for the inevitable. Manager Joe Torre was fast approaching and the boos were escalating, so El Duque stood, scooped up the ball, handed it to Torre and ended his brief debacle with a wounded ego and a sprained right elbow.</p>
        <p>The debacle was not brief for the rest of the Yankees. It stretched across nine torturous innings, culminating in a 17-4 loss to the White Sox. On Saturday, the Yankees had rallied from an 8-0 deficit before losing, 10-9, but they had no dramatic rallies on this gray, gloomy day and were swept in a four-game series at Yankee Stadium for the first time since the White Sox did it in July 1990.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to say it's embarrassing,'' Torre said, ''but you sure don't like getting your butt kicked like we have over this weekend.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees were despondent after the White Sox outscored them by 42-17 in the series, with Torre referring to this slide as ''a blow to the organization'' and General Manager Brian Cashman saying, ''We're playing as bad as we can play.'' The anxiety increased because El Duque was found to have a sprained elbow after he underwent X-rays and a magnetic resonance imaging test at Beth Israel North Hospital.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are unsure whether Hernandez (6-6), their leading winner, will make his next start against the White Sox on Friday in Chicago, and they are hopeful that he does not have to join Roger Clemens on the 15-day disabled list.</p>
        <p>''It's obviously not an immediate D.L. situation,'' Cashman said. ''We think he'll make a start. We're not ruling out Friday, but we're not guaranteeing it either.''</p>
        <p>Cashman said that doctors prescribed rest for Hernandez and that he would be re-evaluated this week, but it seems improbable that he will be able to make his scheduled start. With Clemens sidelined, the team will monitor Hernandez and decide if he can pitch within a week.</p>
        <p>The Yankees would probably allow El Duque to miss a start, but it would be logical to place him on the disabled list if he had to miss more than one.</p>
        <p>This is the first time Hernandez, who missed a start in May because of an upper back injury, has had elbow complications, adding to an already bleak situation for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes,'' Torre said, ''you have to sit back and take it.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees have held repeated discussions about acquiring the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa or Detroit's Juan Gonzalez, and this drought could intensify the owner George Steinbrenner's desire to improve the team. After losing for the sixth time in seven games, the Yankees (34-29) remained a half-game behind the American League East-leading Red Sox, whom they play in a four-game series starting tonight in Boston. But, suddenly, the Toronto Blue Jays trail the Yankees by a half-game.</p>
        <p>Cashman reiterated that there were more quality position players available than pitchers and acknowledged that the Yankees' poor play could make a trade tougher to execute. The Yankees are fortunate that the other teams in the division have also been inconsistent.</p>
        <p>Despite dropping 16 of 28 games, the Yankees have gained a half-game. Still, the standings cannot hide a struggling team that was down by 9-0 after one inning, by 12-0 after two and by 16-0 after five. The Yankees had not allowed nine runs in a first inning since 1979, and the White Sox had not scored nine in a first in 38 years. Derek Jeter was 16 the last time the Yankees were battered for 17 runs.</p>
        <p>''Certainly, it concerns you,'' Paul O'Neill said. ''You don't want someone to come in and embarrass you.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez looked as if he might have hurt himself on the first batter of the game. He sprinted to cover first on Ray Durham's grounder to Tino Martinez and jumped for the base, buckling as he landed and perhaps hurting his back.</p>
        <p>Then the devastation began. After Hernandez walked Valentin, Frank Thomas laced a booming double to make the score 1-0. El Duque walked a batter and Paul Konerko singled home a run, prompting an injury visit from Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach. Hernandez told Stottlemyre that he was fine.</p>
        <p>But Chris Singleton smashed a two-run double and Carlos Lee singled in a run to put the Yankees in a 5-0 hole. Hernandez was not fine. His fastball was limping and his usually impeccable control was awry. He threw first-pitch balls to 6 of 11 batters and went to four three-ball counts, which resulted in three walks and the grand slam.</p>
        <p>Hernandez tugged on his jersey, adjusted his cap and dug around the dirt, searching for a comfort zone. He gave up two singles to the next three batters and later told Torre that he first felt pain in his elbow on the No. 9 batter Mark Johnson's single.</p>
        <p>Still, even though Stottlemyre and catcher Jorge Posada both quizzed Hernandez on how he felt, he continued pitching.</p>
        <p>Hernandez threw 11 pitches after feeling the pain, walking Durham and surrendering Valentin's grand slam on a 3-2 fastball.</p>
        <p>''If you know he's hurt, you don't dare'' let him pitch, Torre said. ''I'm sorry he went two more hitters.''</p>
        <p>Watching Hernandez toil for two-thirds of an inning shocked some Yankees.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't like they were getting cheap hits,'' Jeter said. ''It was like a couple of guys on and 'bam!' A couple of guys on and 'bam!' Before you knew it, it was 9-0.''</p>
        <p>Before you knew it, the Yankees had flopped again.</p>
        <p>Torre speculated that teams are bound to get even with the Yankees after they dominated baseball for three of the last four years. That trend might be changing.</p>
        <p>''We've enjoyed ourselves for four years,'' Torre said. ''We're on our heels and we need to bounce back. We sort of know now what other clubs felt when they played us.''</p>
