        <p>Vivendi and the Seagram Company are preparing to vote today on Vivendi's purchase of Seagram for roughly $33 billion in stock. The companies' boards met over the weekend to discuss the deal, and an agreement could be announced by the end of the day or Tuesday morning, according to a person close to the talks.</p>
        <p>Vivendi owns 49 percent of Canal Plus, the French pay television company, and that company's board is also expected to meet today to approve the Seagram acquisition. Canal Plus is a public company and French law requires that it approve any merger undertaken by Vivendi.</p>

        <p>Vivendi and the Seagram Company are preparing to vote today on Vivendi's purchase of Seagram for roughly $33 billion in stock. The companies' boards met over the weekend to discuss the deal, and an agreement could be announced by the end of the day or Tuesday morning, according to a person close to the talks.</p>
        <p>Vivendi owns 49 percent of Canal Plus, the French pay television company, and that company's board is also expected to meet today to approve the Seagram acquisition. Canal Plus is a public company and French law requires that it approve any merger undertaken by Vivendi.</p>
        <p>In addition to equity of roughly $33 billion, Vivendi is expected to assume $6.6 billion in Seagram debt.</p>
        <p>Two people close to Seagram board members said Edgar Bronfman Jr., Seagram's chief executive, had pushed for a final vote as early as Sunday, but that some directors were reluctant to move that rapidly.</p>
        <p>Charles Bronfman, Edgar Bronfman Jr.'s uncle and a director, has been reducing his stake in Seagram, and there have been reports that he is not happy with the company's performance. One of the people with knowledge of the board said Charles Bronfman did not want to vote on a sale as quickly as his nephew hoped.</p>
        <p>Over the weekend, Mr. Bronfman had misgivings about selling the company founded by his father and about the real value of Vivendi's stock, according to a third executive with knowledge of the board. Nevertheless, this person said, it still seemed quite likely the deal would go through. Mr. Bronfman could not be reached, and a Seagram spokesman declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's board meeting began at 11 a.m. in New York and continued for six hours, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting.</p>
        <p>The final price of the deal is still being negotiated, a person close to the talks said, in part because Vivendi's stock has fallen 14 percent, to $94.40, since word of the deal leaked out last Tuesday. But the price is expected to be around $75 a share. Seagram shareholders are likely to get a collar -- a feature limiting how much the deal price can vary -- if Vivendi's stock falls further. Seagram stock closed at $61.4375 on Friday.</p>
        <p>Edgar Bronfman Jr. is set to become vice chairman of the new company under Vivendi's chairman, Jean-Marie Messier. Mr. Bronfman plans to commute from New York to Vivendi headquarters in Paris.</p>
        <p>Vivendi has indicated that it will sell all or part of Seagram's liquor business to reduce or eliminate Seagram's debt. Vivendi also plans to sell roughly 30 percent of its water business.</p>
        <p>In addition to its stake in Canal Plus, Vivendi is the second-largest cellular telephone and telephone operator in France, and it has a joint venture with Vodafone AirTouch to create a mobile Internet portal in Europe. Seagram owns Universal Studios, several theme parks, a record company and a leading liquor operation.</p>
