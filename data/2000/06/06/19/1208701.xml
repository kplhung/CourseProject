        <p>It was an elementary school summit meeting. Crammed around the low table in the first-grade classroom sat the parents (fidgeting nervously), the principal, the first-grade teacher, the speech therapist and the 11-year-old translator, who had been hauled out of her sixth-grade class for the meeting.</p>
        <p>The news was not unexpected. Eduardo Barros, who like nearly 80 percent of the incoming students in Public School 139 arrived speaking no English, needed to spend another year in first grade to improve his language and comprehension skills.</p>
        <p>''Mommy,'' said Edda Barros, who translated the news about her brother to her parents, ''they are saying that Eduardo has too much trouble reading and understanding. They do not want to put him in second grade and then move him back down. It is better if he does another year.''</p>
        <p>Edda's was not an unfamiliar role. She accompanies her parents, who were born in Ecuador, to the bank, to the doctor and on shopping trips, as well as to all school functions. It is her job to make sure her brother understands and completes his homework and to riffle through electric and gas bills, business letters, rent notices and school and community announcements. Edda's cousins, some in their 20's, often call with questions about English phrasing. One, who is 30, has used her help to get through a computer course. After learning about American traditions for holidays like Thanksgiving and Easter, Edda explained the customs to her family and insisted that her mother stuff and bake a turkey in November and hide candy eggs around the apartment in April.</p>
        <p>Like millions of young children in immigrant families, Edda is much more than a translator for first-generation parents who speak little English. She interprets American culture, customs and mores for her parents, at times gently correcting and advising them. She plays a vital and at times nerve-racking role, navigating the complex and intimidating world of hospitals, law offices and officialdom. One slip, she knows, could mean disaster.</p>
        <p>She assumes, as do more than half the students in her class, responsibilities and duties usually left to parents in English-speaking families. Along the way, she must listen to unvarnished and unsettling accounts of her father's illnesses and looming financial difficulties. It can be, she says, overwhelming.</p>
        <p>''There are times, especially with doctors, when I have no idea what they are talking about,'' Edda said in English, seated in her Queens apartment with her parents. ''But I have to translate something. My parents rely on me. I have to keep asking and asking what it means, what they are talking about. And sometimes I have my own life, my own work to do, but I have to stop to help my brother or leave to go with mother or father. It is tiring.''</p>
        <p>Teachers and administrators in schools like P.S. 139, where 36 different languages are spoken and 77 of the 100 children in kindergarten come from homes in which the parents speak a foreign language, say young children must often mediate with parents to get them to conform to American society. And each new hurdle loads more onto the children.</p>
        <p>''It is often too much for their fragile nervous systems,'' said Khanna Borukhov, a teacher in the English as a Second Language program at P.S. 139.</p>
        <p>''They want to be leaders, but they do not have the capacity. They struggle to validate themselves, going from family appointment to family appointment. It leads to a kind of role reversal. Parents can begin to resent the power the child assumes. The parent wants to be a parent and the child wants to be a child, but because of the circumstances they cannot. With all that pressure it is hard for the child to function academically.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Gary D. Goldenback, the supervisor of the E.S.L. program for District 28, which includes P.S. 139, says that when children are taken out of school to accompany parents to appointments or on routine chores, the missed classes can affect homework and test scores.</p>
        <p>''When this is done excessively, it can even harm chances for promotion,'' he said. ''One should remember that some of these parents do not even have the English facility to buy a subway token or ask directions, so they must take the child along.''</p>
        <p>Conflict often comes in later years, when parents try to reclaim the authority they have ceded.</p>
        <p>''This has contributed to the gang culture,'' said Frayda Sharaby, an E.S.L. teacher at P.S. 139. ''These older children look for other avenues where they can again exercise authority.''</p>
        <p>Conflict also often erupts around benign and simple tasks. Many immigrant parents will not sign school permission slips or allow their children to go on overnight trips.</p>
        <p>''A lot of these families live in fear of deportation,'' said Dr. Goldenback. ''They fear that something could happen to the child if they sign anything, even a report card. At school, a child may be told every day to get his parents to sign a slip, and at home, his parents may be steadfastly refusing to cooperate. It is a lot of pressure.''</p>
        <p>And there is pressure on these students to Americanize their parents. ''Bangladeshi women will typically not leave their homes, day or night, unescorted,'' said Dr. Goldenback. ''The school can call, say a child is sick, but it does not mean the mother can come. She may have to wait for her husband. What looks like negligence is not.''</p>
        <p>Just as parents fight to grasp the new world, teachers fight to comprehend the old. Discussions about summer camps, for example, have disturbed children from the former Yugoslavia, where families were held in detention centers. Simple rituals, such as fire drills, have sent some children into hysterics.</p>
        <p>''We had a child who thought we were being bombed,'' said Steven C. Rosenberg, the principal of P.S. 139.</p>
        <p>And school officials, as well as parents, can become perplexed by it all.</p>
        <p>Cristina Chin, the co-president of the P.S. 139 parents' association, said she resorted at one point to speaking with a parent in an improvised sign language. And Mr. Rosenberg's best efforts to bridge the language gap have sometimes backfired. ''I brought a boy in the office to help translate for a couple that did not speak English,'' he said. ''He listened and told me, 'That's not my kind of Chinese.' ''</p>
        <p>Classrooms must also adjust to new traditions, such as allowing Muslims to skip lunch during Ramadan, and new cultural sensitivities.</p>
        <p>''I had a child from Iran in my class,'' said Ms. Sharaby, the E.S.L. teacher. ''One day Mitre did something I perceived as brilliant. I said it was not just one thumb up, but two thumbs up. She fell to the floor laughing.'' The thumbs up sign, it turns out, is a foul insult in Iran.</p>
        <p>The new wave of immigrants is so diverse that it is also impossible to keep up with the plethora of languages, even in schools such as P.S. 139, where teachers or administrators speak Spanish, Korean and Russian.</p>
        <p>The parents-night meetings are broken down into clusters, so children can translate what is being discussed. Newsletters go out in Russian, Spanish, Korean and Chinese, in an effort to reach at least some of the community in their own tongue. And teachers, dizzy with the infusion of cultures, customs and languages, look for ways to make the American experience relevant.</p>
        <p>''How are the Pilgrims like Russians?'' Jackie A. Neuwirt, the first-grade teacher in classroom 1-229, asked her pupils one morning last week.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Neuwirt, whose parents did not speak English when they arrived in Queens in 1959 from Israel, explained to her pupils that the Russians came to the United States to escape religious persecution and find freedom. She pointed to a bulletin board in her classroom labeled ''We are the children of the world'' that had 15 figures, labeled with names of countries like Peru, Azerbaijan, Nepal and Taiwan, that represented the cultural backgrounds of her 20 students.</p>
        <p>''How many other people came for this reason?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>The music teacher at P.S. 139, Fern Nash, has the school choral group do songs in Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Yiddish, French, Korean, German and Mandarin.</p>
        <p>''We incorporate the school's diversity into the program,'' she said.  ''I have Chinese kids who know songs in Yiddish and have danced in Indian costumes. It is all here.''</p>
        <p>Years later, some who assumed the role of interlocutors say it was not only burdensome but uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Neuwirt's sister, Zeporah Becker-Gonzalez, a fifth-grade teacher at John I. Smith Elementary in Miami, remembers what it felt like to be the family translator.</p>
        <p>''I was often embarrassed that my parents could not speak English or assimilate,'' she said. ''I wanted to be just like the other kids. I wanted to be an American.''</p>
        <p>One way she rebelled was by refusing to respond in Hebrew when her parents spoke to her. Despite the family tensions, she said she believed she was a stronger person for the experience.</p>
        <p>''They could not help me with my homework,'' she said of her parents. ''I had to do it myself. I could not depend on them to help me as much as other parents that spoke English. It made me more self-reliant than other children.''</p>
