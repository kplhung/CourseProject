        <p>Southern Baptists are off the scale of political incorrectness. Why do they insist on traditional roles for women, denounce abortion and homosexuality, and evangelize to people of all religious backgrounds? The answer is that as the culture moves steadily away from a biblical morality, our 16 million members and 41,000 churches are applying the brakes.</p>
        <p>At last week's annual meeting in Orlando, we reaffirmed our beliefs in our traditional way -- democratically. The convention passed a revised confession of faith, restating our beliefs, urging Christians to oppose racism and stating that the office of pastor in our denomination ''is limited to men as qualified by Scripture.''</p>

        <p>Southern Baptists are off the scale of political incorrectness. Why do they insist on traditional roles for women, denounce abortion and homosexuality, and evangelize to people of all religious backgrounds? The answer is that as the culture moves steadily away from a biblical morality, our 16 million members and 41,000 churches are applying the brakes.</p>
        <p>At last week's annual meeting in Orlando, we reaffirmed our beliefs in our traditional way -- democratically. The convention passed a revised confession of faith, restating our beliefs, urging Christians to oppose racism and stating that the office of pastor in our denomination ''is limited to men as qualified by Scripture.''</p>
        <p>Our conservatism comes from our members and remains dominant through their determination. The Southern Baptist Convention really is a convention. Messengers elected by local congregations debate and vote in a setting that is part New England town meeting and part sawdust revival. Sessions mix business and inspiration. Memorable actions are proposed directly from the floor.</p>
        <p>Three decades ago, conservatives detecting theological defection in our denomination's seminaries and boards launched a movement to recover the denomination for biblical orthodoxy. It emerged just as the denominations of mainline Protestantism were swerving to the left. In 1979, the convention embraced biblical inerrancy, the belief that the Bible is the very word of God, completely without error. Conservatives have won our presidency every year since.</p>
        <p>The so-called moderates have mostly left the convention, forming a series of shadow organizations, each of which emerges with a larger letterhead and smaller numbers. Meanwhile, our denomination has become the evangelical behemoth, more than twice the size of any other Protestant body, with congregations in all 50 states and 1,000 new churches each year. Though proud of its rural roots, the convention is now dominated by suburban churches, and its fastest growth is among ethnic churches.</p>
        <p>Southern Baptists know they are in a race against time and the direction of the culture. As issues like homosexual marriage, abortion, euthanasia, and attacks upon the natural family have exploded, Baptists have held themselves captive to God's word.</p>
        <p>Arguments over women in the pastorate and order in the Christian home (two years ago, the convention declared that wives should submit to their husbands) are not well understood by outside observers. For the vast majority of Southern Baptists, these issues are settled by the word of God. Fewer than 1 percent of our churches have ever called a woman to preach. Southern Baptists experience family trouble like everyone else, but at least they know how God intended to order the family.</p>
        <p>In essence, Southern Baptists are engaged in a battle against modernity, earnestly contending for the truth and authority of an ancient faith. To the cultured critics of religion, we are the cantankerous holdouts against the inevitable. But so far as the Southern Baptist Convention is concerned, the future is in God's hands. If faithfulness requires the slings and arrows of outraged opponents, so be it.</p>
