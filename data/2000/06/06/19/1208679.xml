        <p>The war between Ethiopia and Eritrea came to an official halt today, closing two years of fighting in one of the fiercest wars in Africa, as the nations signed a preliminary cease-fire and agreed to work toward a final settlement.</p>
        <p>The two nations' foreign ministers, who did not speak to each other during the negotiations, shook hands after the 15-point document was signed in Algeria.</p>
        <p>Haile Woldensae, the Eritrean foreign minister, said it was ''the first concrete step toward peace between the two countries after a useless war.'' His Ethiopian counterpart, Seyoum Mesfin, called the agreement ''historic.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Woldansae's characterization of the war as ''useless'' has often been used to describe the border war that has crippled two economically developing countries and killed tens of thousands of its young men and women. It has also uprooted hundreds of thousands of Eritreans and destroyed, for perhaps many years, the once close relationship between the two nations.</p>
        <p>The document signed today is not a final cease-fire, but it does provide detailed plans for disengaging the two armies and devising a lasting solution. Most important, the plan calls for creation of a 15.5-mile buffer zone along the border, all in Eritrean territory, acknowledging Ethiopia's gains on the battlefield since the latest round of fighting began on May 12. But in a concession to Eritrea, its officials and citizens may return to the buffer zone as negotiations progress on the final accord.</p>
        <p>The plan also calls for United Nations peacekeepers to patrol parts of the zone, as well as the main areas of contention. Those areas are likely to include Zalambessa and Bure to the east, and Badme to the west, where the hostilities began in May 1998. Eritrea has claimed pockets along the 620-mile border as its own, under colonial treaties, and had moved troops into those zones. They were pushed back by Ethiopian troops in the last month of fighting.</p>
        <p>The United Nations has not yet approved a peacekeeping mission and so there are no estimates of its size, duration or timing. But this is a  time of increasing skepticism about peacekeeping missions in Africa. Peacekeepers were taken hostage in Sierra Leone, and a cease-fire in Congo -- where such a mission has already been approved but no soldiers have been deployed -- has been repeatedly violated by all sides.</p>
        <p>Anthony Lake, a former American national security adviser who helped broker the agreement today, echoed remarks by other foreign officials that this proposed peacekeeping mission is ''different'' from others. He noted that the armies of the two participating countries are ''highly disciplined'' and that the leaders of both nations are committed to the agreement.</p>
        <p>''The good news is that each of them -- repeatedly over the last two years and again today -- said they were very serious once they signed about implementing it,'' Mr. Lake said in a telephone interview today from Algiers, where he attended the signing ceremony.</p>
        <p>''I think there is a very strong reason to believe this will not be like other cessation of hostility agreements on other parts of the continent,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The most important element of the final peace accord will be the demarcation of the border -- which was never settled when Eritrea, for a generation the northernmost province of Ethiopia, gained its independence in 1993. The question will be settled technically by United Nations cartographers, using old colonial treaties and other documents.</p>
        <p>Like other officials, Mr. Lake portrayed the signing today as a ray of hope for Africa, at a time when the continent is torn by so much conflict in places like Sierra Leone, Angola, Congo and Burundi. He and others noted that the accord was largely the product of the Organization for African Unity, which will also oversee how it is carried out.</p>
        <p>If the peace accord works, Ethiopia and Eritrea, which had been seen generally as two stable nations with promising economies, may be back on track for development. ''There is a growing stereotype that what Africans do is kill each other,'' he said. ''That simply is not true.''</p>
        <p>''The fact is that most Africans want to live in peace, just like most Americans and everyone else,'' he added. ''I worry that the stereotype to the contrary is going to damage our ability to work with them in the coming years. So I hope this is one ripple of reality against this stereotypical current.''</p>
