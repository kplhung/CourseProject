        <p>A yellow-cab driver died early yesterday after being punched in the face by a passenger on Central Park South, the police said. A 32-year-old man was arrested and charged in the attack later in the day.</p>
        <p>The police said three men entered a cab driven by Mohammed Butt, 50, at 1:25 a.m. as it idled at a taxi stand at 40 Central Park South near Mickey Mantle's restaurant. The men demanded to be taken to three different destinations, they said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Butt argued with the group, the police said, and one of the passengers stepped from the cab, walked to the driver's side door and punched Mr. Butt in the mouth through an open window.</p>
        <p>The men fled, the police said. Mr. Butt, spitting blood, soon began complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. He was taken to St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center, where he was pronounced dead at 2:45 a.m.</p>
        <p>At 4:30 p.m. the police arrested Salim Malik of Elmhurst Avenue in Queens and charged him with misdemeanor assault, said Detective Edward Reuss, a police spokesman. No more serious charge was filed because Mr. Butt's death has not been classified as a homicide, pending an autopsy by the medical examiner, Detective Reuss said.</p>
        <p>A police spokeswoman, Sgt. Gerry Falcon, said of the cause of Mr. Butt's death, ''It appears right now that it was cardiac arrest.''</p>
        <p>But among fellow drivers and the dead man's friends and family, the opinion was unanimous: Mohammed Butt had been killed on duty, and was the victim of the job-related violence that has claimed 10 livery-cab drivers and another yellow-cab driver this year.</p>
        <p>''People think we are slaves,'' said Ghulam Khan, a yellow-cab driver who lived with Mr. Butt at 34-11 Bradley Avenue in Long Island City, Queens. ''They can abuse us, mistreat us, murder us and run away.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Butt moved to New York from Sialkot, Pakistan, seven years ago. He had been waiting for immigration papers that would allow his four children and wife to move to the United States. ''He was thinking of the future,'' a cousin, Nisir Butt, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khan said he and Mr. Butt would often talk on cellular phones while driving, chatting about their plans and sharing information about traffic. The last phone call came early yesterday morning, Mr. Khan said. He recalled his friend saying: ''Something bad has happened. Come here immediately.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Khan said he sped from Penn Station to Central Park South, and, arriving at the park's edge, he saw the police commotion, which was just 100 yards from where the sexual assaults occurred during and after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade last week. His friend, Mr. Khan said, gasped and spat blood before he was loaded into an ambulance.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Khan and Mr. Butt's cousin said Mr. Butt had not had heart problems.</p>
        <p>At the taxi stand yesterday, cabbies demanded that the police treat the death as a murder. One driver, Daniel Abayev, 24, said the dispute and punch might have been recorded on the video surveillance cameras of the hotels and residential high-rises that line Central Park South.</p>
        <p>''They have video cameras around here,'' Mr. Abayev said. ''The police have got to get them. They have to find these bad men.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Abayev and others said they were concerned that the case would get little official attention. Mr. Butt was dead. The cabbies were angry and frightened. Without being classified as a homicide, it would not become a priority.</p>
        <p>''Everybody treats us like we are animals,'' he said. ''We got the accents. We don't talk the good English. No police think of us, except maybe to give us tickets.''</p>
