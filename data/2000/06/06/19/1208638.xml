        <p>''Republic stock skyrockets on news of possible sale.'' That was the headline in The Arizona Republic on Friday, June 9, the day after Central Newspapers Inc., The Republic's parent, put itself on the market.</p>
        <p>Only days earlier, acting on the rumors that the company was up for sale, six reporters and four supervisors added more of Central's stock to their 401(K) retirement accounts.</p>
        <p>It was good retirement planning: Central's stock jumped 40 percent on the news, closing on Friday at $57.1875.</p>
        <p>It was not a good career move, however. In a letter to readers published on Friday, Pam Johnson, the newspaper's executive editor, said that the supervisors were suspended without pay for an undisclosed period; letters noting the incident were recorded in the reporters' personnel files.</p>
        <p>In her notice, Ms. Johnson wrote that, while the staffers involved had done nothing illegal in trading on the rumors of the sale, ''This was in violation of our newsroom ethics policy, which says Republic journalists should never attempt to gain from information that the general public does not have access to.''</p>
        <p>Speaking in an interview on Friday, she added, ''We found some undeniable circumstances and have dealt with it.'' About those involved, she said, ''It was an unfortunate lapse, and many of them are taking this hard, that they've disappointed themselves, their peers and us.'' None of those involved, she said, had direct responsibility for coverage of the newspaper group's move.</p>
        <p>There have been other stock-trading issues in newsrooms the last year. At The San Jose Mercury, a business columnist, Chris Nolan, was disciplined for accepting stock in an initial public offering. Ms. Nolan maintained she had never written about the company involved and had informed her editors of her plans.</p>
        <p>But The Republic has had shocks from a variety of sources. Last fall, a high-profile columnist, Julie Amparano, was dismissed when named sources in several columns were impossible to find.</p>
