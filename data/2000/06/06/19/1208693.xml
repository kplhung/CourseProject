        <p>Yoel Judah walks slowly, talks fast. It is a disarming contradiction, to watch the casual way he saunters into a room, usually a son or two in tow, and to hear his words tripping and tumbling over each other, his voice all low and lyrical.</p>
        <p>Judah ambled into Gleason's Gym in Brooklyn recently to work out with his boxing star of a son, Zabdiel Judah. They were dressed alike, stylish in designer T-shirts and billowing jeans. Jumpy teenagers and former fighters shook Zab's hand or slapped his back, but they huddled with Yoel. Zab is the newly crowned junior-welterweight champion of the International Boxing Federation, a 22-year-old who will defend his title for the first time on Saturday, but his father is the one with all the answers.</p>
        <p>As Zab busied himself with sparring, his father stood ringside, arms draped over the ropes. Yoel never took his eyes off his son in the ring, but he still managed to conduct three or four simultaneous conversations with those gathered around him. Occasionally, he barked encouragement.</p>
        <p>''Good, there you go,'' Yoel said. ''Back up! Go in! Good.''</p>
        <p>Yoel is a seventh-degree black belt and a former world-champion kick boxer, but more important, he is the undisputed ruler of Team Judah, a stable of seven fighting sons who range in age from 8 to 24. They call him Abba, Hebrew for father. They, like many large families, are insular -- you see the fun and wish you could join but cannot. Yet there is something eerie about this family of fighters and its patriarch.</p>
        <p>''Well, you know, I got an aura around me,'' Yoel said after the workout.</p>
        <p>The aura's name is Order. Yoel Judah's life has always been about order and violence and scratching out an identity within the two. Like the yin-yang philosophy he loves so well, order and violence are his pendulum. Those forces govern every aspect of his life as well as the lives of his sons, whom he has reared almost single-handedly.</p>
        <p>Yoel, who is in his early 40's, once kept his distance as a father and lost the custody of his children. He worked feverishly to reclaim them, though, and has since made them the center of his world. He has full custody of all seven sons, although their mother still sees them occasionally.</p>
        <p>Yoel's is a world without question: he gives the rules, and the boys follow. The family is coiled in discipline, and yet it seems to thrive in the environment. The boys idolize their father. They are polite, diligent, soft spoken and eager to please. None have been lost to the prison system or the streets of Brooklyn. And none expect anything less than to succeed.</p>
        <p>Zab knocked out Jan Bergman (38-3) in the fourth round on Feb. 12 to claim the I.B.F. junior-welterweight title at Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Conn. He will defend his title on Saturday against Jason Rowland (21-1) in Glasgow, on the Mike Tyson-Lou Savarese undercard.</p>
        <p>Zab has 23 professional victories, 18 by knockout, and no losses, and boxing writers have long called him ''Pernell Whitaker with power.''</p>
        <p>Zab's manager of four years, Shelly Finkel, said the differences between the two left-handers are almost too subtle to detect. ''I've managed Pernell for 17 years,'' Finkel said, ''and the only difference is that Zab's punch is better.''</p>
        <p>Within New York boxing circles, he was considered championship material years ago. ''I don't get excited too much about any fighter,'' said Joe Guzman, a boxing historian, ''but Zab Judah is the best fighter out there, maybe with the exception of Roy Jones. He is a kid who's going to make $50 million, and you see a fighter like that once every 10 years.''</p>
        <p>Godliness and the Crossbar</p>
        <p>Yoel Judah gave his sons biblical names: Ariel, Daniel, Zabdiel, Joseph, Josiah, Michael and Yoel Jr. Zab's namesake is found in I Chronicles 27 of the Old Testament, a soldier in charge of King David's first army division of 24,000 men. The man's life is encapsulated in one sentence about his occupation and his ancestry.</p>
        <p>''He was a leader of an army, and his father was Jashobeam,'' Zab said. ''It's deep.''</p>
        <p>In Jewish genealogies, the story of the son always begins with the father. It grounds him, explains him. And it is the same with the Judah family. At 13, Yoel embraced a century-old hybrid of Christianity, Judaism and black nationalism, and today he and his sons call themselves Israelites, or Black Jews. The movement is informal and varied, and some branches of the Israelites have even been accepted by Reform Judaism. The Judahs do not belong to a formal congregation. Instead, they huddle in their East Flatbush home in the evenings or on weekends to hear Yoel tell them about the men of God. King Solomon is a favorite.</p>
        <p>''Godliness means you got laws that govern you, and the laws are good,'' Yoel said. ''If you don't fear God and you don't have any guidance, I'm going to have to watch you because you might do anything. You're an outlaw. I got a lot of friends like that, and now they're in the Crossbar Hotel.''</p>
        <p>As a child, Yoel craved the guidance of his father, James Judah, but James, a decorated Korean War veteran and club fighter, instilled in his son little beyond a reverence for self-discipline and an ability to fight. James divorced Yoel's mother, Viola, when Yoel was 12, and after that he was gone.</p>
        <p>In need of a father figure, Yoel and his older brother, James, found a group of retired fighters who hung out at the Police Athletic League in Brownsville. They introduced the boys to karate, and Yoel said he immediately fell in love with the structure and science of the sport. Within the long workouts and the Zen mind-set, he found order.</p>
        <p>''I was a really crazy martial artist,'' he said, ''doing knuckle push-ups and 300 sit-ups and running from Brooklyn to Queens and all that stuff.''</p>
        <p>He became a seventh-degree black belt, and was a world champion kick boxer with 11 title defenses while also dabbling as a professional boxer, with a 5-0 record. He befriended neighborhood boxers like Mark Breland and a young Mike Tyson. But even after he had children of his own, Yoel was not aware that all the laurels came with a price. The realization came after he had been away at a fight sometime in the early 1980's. At the time, he was living with the mother of his children, Yamima, whom he never married.</p>
        <p>''I was fighting then, and I went away to Florida to a fight, and she was messing with the drugs here,'' he said, his voice getting husky with emotion. ''She got messed up, and basically, she left them for two days in the house. So the authorities came in and snatched them. I come home, and my whole family is just gone.''</p>
        <p>The children were placed in foster care, and for the next year and a half, Yoel was allowed to see them only for an hour on Fridays. He got jobs digging ditches and working on construction sites and he never missed an appointment to see his children.</p>
        <p>''That's one of those things, man, in my life where I could have really flipped out, but I kept my composure,'' he said. ''The judges later awarded me full custody, but at the time, the things I had wasn't up to their standards. I had to have this and that, make X amount a year, so I said: 'O.K., that's what I have to do? I'll do it,' and it took me about a year to put it all together.</p>
        <p>''I went after it like a madman -- got me a good job, bigger crib, car, money in the bank, prove myself clean, everything. And once I had them back, yo, I wasn't ever going to lose them again. Had to hold tight.''</p>
        <p>Chores and a List of Don'ts</p>
        <p>Years later, he still holds tight. Everyone who knows the Judahs has heard about the worksheet, a rotating list of chores Yoel keeps posted in the kitchen. Each evening after coming home from the gym, the boys are expected to mop the floors, put out the garbage, do the dishes and clean the basement. Zab is no exception, even though he now has his own place in Rosedale, Queens. When he comes home for dinner or a visit, which is almost daily, he has to pitch in. Yoel said the chores keep Zab humble and hungry.</p>
        <p>''Yoel runs a tight house,'' Yoel's brother, James, said, ''and it's immaculate.''</p>
        <p>Rules extend beyond housework. Michael, 16, said the don'ts are too many to recall. Don't break stuff. Don't do drugs. Don't go to bed late. Don't forget your chores. Don't go anywhere without telling Yoel. Don't hang out on the streets. (Punishments run anywhere from being grounded for a month to doing 100 knuckle push-ups on the concrete driveway.)</p>
        <p>''Sometimes he gets this look on his face, this mean look,'' Michael said with a laugh, ''and you know it's time to get serious.''</p>
        <p>Fighting was one area Yoel always took seriously. Before and after he retired from kick boxing in 1991, he had the children tag along when he went to the gym. They lined up, ringside, and watched his moves and learned to fear their father almost as much as they loved him.</p>
        <p>''You watch him flip around dudes his size and then look at our size, and we'd be like, 'Hold up, if he can do them like that, what could he do to us?' '' Zab said. ''So pretty much, we never did too much.''</p>
        <p>Not only did the karate and boxing lessons keep his sons in a protective gym most of the afternoon, Yoel hoped the training would also give them the confidence to walk away from fights. During the early years, they lived in Bedford-Stuyvesant, so he knew they would be tested.</p>
        <p>''When you know how to fight, you don't easily jump into a fight,'' he said. ''Boxing will let you walk down a street at 1 o'clock in the morning, not because you're cocky, but because you're confident. At the same time, boxing gives you wisdom. You won't be a fool.''</p>
        <p>But an undercurrent of anger courses through a contact sport like boxing. No matter how much you study the art and the grace of boxing, its execution will inevitably end in pain. That is the point: to leave the other guy in more pain than you. So as the boys learned the mechanics of the fight, a few like Zab could not help but try it out now and then. Zab even said he and his brother Daniel were ''the fightingest brothers in Brooklyn.''</p>
        <p>''I was not a troubled, bad kid,'' Zab said, ''but I had all this energy. I was just bound to be a boxer.''</p>
        <p>So, it seems, were all the Judahs. Three of them have won the Golden Gloves, the well-known amateur tournament: Ariel, once; Daniel, twice; and Zab, three times. Some, like Michael, have also maintained their study of the martial arts.</p>
        <p>But Zab is the hope of his father, the world champion. That is why Yoel doctored Zab's birth certificate when the 16-year-old was too young to enter the Golden Gloves the first time around. Zab thanked him by winning the tournament. Two years later, when Lou Duva, who was then a manager with Main Events, invited Zab to spar with Pernell (Sweet Pea) Whitaker, it was Yoel who told his son to play it cool in front of the promoters.</p>
        <p>''I was overwhelmed,'' Zab said, ''but the whole time Dad was saying: 'Be careful of the hand that gives you gifts. Nobody gives you nothing for nothing.' And he was right. It was good advice.''</p>
        <p>Yoel said Zab has ''grown into a very smart kid.''</p>
        <p>''But you know, I raised all my sons to think for themselves,'' he said. ''I told them, 'I'll help you as much as I can, but you got to make it happen because one day I'm not going to be around, and I want you to survive and take care of yourself.' All my sons' lives are better than mine because I made it that way.''</p>
        <p>An Undercurrent of Independence</p>
        <p>Zab Judah has spent a short lifetime listening to his father, absorbing his order. So when it is his turn to talk these days, he speaks in the same low, rumbling way. He even tosses up like-minded phrases about ''the awareness of self.'' It is clear that the Judahs are a family too tightly laced for notions of real independence. Yoel will not let go of Team Judah, and Zab will not ask him to do so.</p>
        <p>''Me and my guys, we're like a fortress,'' Yoel said. ''I love them. They love me. Case closed.''</p>
        <p>Zab still depends on his father, especially where his rising career is concerned. Zab is currently entertaining a $5 million contract renewal from Main Events, as well as endorsement offers from Magic Johnson, the Wayans brothers and Pepsi. He has top-drawer representation in Finkel, his manager, and his earnings have topped $250,000. But Yoel still has final say on all matters, which is why Zab waited six months to buy a $60,000 gold Cadillac Escalade with some of his prize money. He wanted his father's permission first.</p>
        <p>''He taught me everything I know,'' Zab said. ''Why would I take advice from my father my whole life, and then one day put someone over him just because they're XYZ? I just wouldn't allow that to happen.''</p>
        <p>But under that loyal veneer, things are changing for Zab. He is a man now, and he was reared to act like one, to think for himself. And sometimes, especially lately, he thinks about not being a boxer.</p>
        <p>Sitting in his pearlized sports utility vehicle after the workout, he quietly said that he would never have pursued the sport had his father not been a fighter. There is a lot of pride and a little resentment in his voice when he talks about such things. Because now that he is successful, Zab knows what kind of world and profession his father has given him. He loves his father, but there is an unmistakable strain. Zab is at the age when one wants to break free and forge ahead, confident and capable and separate. But he cannot move far from his father.</p>
        <p>As for boxing, he has never been seriously injured, he said, but he does ache and bleed. He spends extra hours in the ring working on defense because of friends like Stephan Johnson, a Brooklyn fighter who died last fall from a boxing-related concussion. Zab also knows plenty about those in the boxing business who would take advantage of the unwary, so he buys books on financial planning and invests most of his earnings in the stock market.</p>
        <p>There is still plenty of bravado in him, of course. He still has a few ideas about greater greatness, about becoming the undisputed champion of the world and fighting two opponents on the same night. He also wants to have a family of his own, and he wants to be a good father. He wants to be a role model and a best friend, just as his father is to him.</p>
        <p>But Zab's fathering will be different. In his family, when he is the father, he said that boxing will not be encouraged. Zab's order will have to come from somewhere else. His will not be the fighting kind.</p>
        <p>''No way,'' he said, his voice hovering above a whisper. ''From me being in it and knowing the game and knowing what's behind it, I would never try to put my child through that. I'm going to try to make enough of a life for me, my kids and their kids.''</p>
