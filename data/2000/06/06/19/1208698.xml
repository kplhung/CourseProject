        <p>The emotions were swirling again for Chuck Knoblauch yesterday before the Yankees' 17-4 loss to the Chicago White Sox, confusing emotions that he has conceded will not soon vanish. Knoblauch is the second baseman who does not understand why his throws to first base sometimes act like paper airplanes, sailing without any direction.</p>
        <p>He shrugged his shoulders and scrunched his face when he casually fielded questions. He spoke about the difficulty of having an ailing father on Father's Day, about being unable to persuade his mother to visit him from Texas and about how any progress he makes in combating his problem will probably be incremental.</p>

        <p>The emotions were swirling again for Chuck Knoblauch yesterday before the Yankees' 17-4 loss to the Chicago White Sox, confusing emotions that he has conceded will not soon vanish. Knoblauch is the second baseman who does not understand why his throws to first base sometimes act like paper airplanes, sailing without any direction.</p>
        <p>He shrugged his shoulders and scrunched his face when he casually fielded questions. He spoke about the difficulty of having an ailing father on Father's Day, about being unable to persuade his mother to visit him from Texas and about how any progress he makes in combating his problem will probably be incremental.</p>
        <p>''You guys see the baseball stuff,'' Knoblauch said. ''It might not be a baseball thing. It probably isn't. It's probably something else.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch suggested that he received some sort of treatment to deal with his chronic throwing problems following the 1999 season, but he has refused to discuss what he might have done. He has ignored the reams of unsolicited advice he has received and snapped his fingers to indicate that, if this were a trivial problem, it would have been solved by now.</p>
        <p>While Knoblauch has acknowledged that he will undergo some treatment, he has refused to disclose whether it will be with a sports psychologist. When he was asked why he was reluctant to talk about what he might have done to address the problem previously, the second baseman bristled slightly.</p>
        <p>''What did you do this winter?'' he said, repeating a reporter's question. ''The winter is personal. I know people want to know, but I don't think I should talk about it.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch fielded two grounders yesterday in the five innings he played and tossed soft, accurate throws to first both times, which caused the fans to explode in applause. As gracious as it was for fans to cheer for Knoblauch, he would obviously prefer it if a routine throw did not attract intense attention.</p>
        <p>When Knoblauch whipped a ball into the stands on Saturday, it struck Marie Olbermann, the mother of Keith, a broadcaster for Fox Sports. Although some players discussed the bizarre nature of whom the ball hit, Knoblauch said he was unaware the ball hit Keith Olbermann's mother until reporters told him yesterday.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was Father's Day, a difficult day for anyone who has lost a father or who feels as if a father has been lost. Ray Knoblauch coached Chuck during his amateur career, and Chuck credits his father with helping him reach the major leagues. But Knoblauch has not really been able to speak with his father during his two-year throwing ordeal because Ray has Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        <p>''It's never easy,'' Knoblauch said. ''It's not just because it's Father's Day. It doesn't change. That's never easy.''</p>
        <p>After Knoblauch made three errors in Thursday's game and he and Manager Joe Torre agreed that he should leave Yankee Stadium, the first thing Knoblauch did was call his mother, Linda. Knoblauch, who talks to his mother almost every day, said she told him she wanted to travel to New York and hug him. Still, Knoblauch has been unable to pry his mother from Texas.</p>
        <p>''I've asked her to come, but she can't,'' Knoblauch said. ''She doesn't want to leave him.''</p>
