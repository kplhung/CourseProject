        <p>By relaxing rules and applying only a spotty enforcement of travel restrictions, the Clinton administration is opening Cuba to American travelers at a rate not seen in more than 40 years.</p>
        <p>While administration officials deny that the increased travel is intended to undermine the 38-year-old embargo against Cuba, the new flow has given rise to a flurry of business, personal and political contacts, and there is a renewed push in some circles -- both Democratic and Republican -- to relax the commercial boycott, one of the last relics of the increasingly distant cold war.</p>
        <p>The number of Americans traveling legally to Cuba has surged by 10 percent a year in the last five years, Treasury Department officials said. And the number traveling to Cuba on the sly more than doubled in the same period, they said.</p>
        <p>According to Cuban government figures, about 135,000 Americans visited Cuba last year on individual or group trips sanctioned under the administration's increasingly relaxed rules. And some 22,000 Americans went last year illegally through third countries, according to the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council.</p>
        <p>The increase in Americans going to Cuba reflects an administration strategy to encourage contacts between civilians in both lands, partly as a way to help Cuba prepare for a smooth transition after President Fidel Castro, who has ruled since 1959, is no longer in power.</p>
        <p>The administration has helped make those growing numbers possible by allowing direct flights to Havana from New York and Los Angeles this year, and adding more flights from Miami, which now reach four cities in Cuba. The number of people traveling directly to Cuba grew by almost 50 percent last year.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Commerce Department increasingly approves licenses for private planes, like those that carried executives in January to the first trade show of American medical products in Havana.</p>
        <p>[Speaking on CNN's ''Both Sides with Jesse Jackson'' on Sunday, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said, ''I think we have to keep pursuing, through ways that we can, the people to people contacts and trying to expand the space for the people'' of Cuba.]</p>
        <p>Charles S. Shapiro, the director of the State Department's Office of Cuban Affairs, said that by making more contact with Americans, Cubans ''understand they can make decisions in their own lives.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether the new strategy is a way to relax the embargo while avoiding the political firestorm that would accompany a formal attempt to do so, Mr. Shapiro said, ''Absolutely not.'' Congress is needed for any substantial policy switch, he said. ''What the president can do is make some changes in the margins.''</p>
        <p>In 1996, Congress codified the Cuban embargo into law. That stripped the president of the ability to lift sanctions by executive order, as he has done, for example, with Vietnam. But the president retains a right to define who can travel, and the administration is considering additional measures to ease travel further, including lifting the once-a-year restriction on visits by Cuban-Americans, officials said.</p>
        <p>Representative Mark Sanford, a South Carolina Republican, returned from a recent trip to Cuba and introduced a bill to let Americans travel freely to the island, arguing that the trade ban is failing and the limits on travelers are unconstitutional. ''I thought we were supposedly shutting the place down,'' he said, ''and you see all this new hotel construction.''</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, some members of the Congressional Black Caucus who went to Havana returned denouncing the embargo. The American Farm Bureau threw its weight behind a Republican proposal to allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba after two Democrats from Arkansas returned eager to sell rice. A top official of the United States Chamber of Commerce emerged from a meeting with Cuban officials saying that Cuba is willing to negotiate compensation for properties it confiscated from American companies more than four decades ago.</p>
        <p>The ''people to people'' contacts were authorized with bipartisan support in the 1992 Cuban Democracy Act but were not broadly put into effect until last year. Access to Cuba, the top Caribbean tourist destination a half century ago, has been limited for decades to American journalists, government officials and Cuban exiles visiting relatives. Now the flow includes the likes of the Yale Glee Club, the Baltimore Orioles and 130 students from Buxton High School in Williamstown, Mass.</p>
        <p>''You can put me next to a person on the street and I'll tell you how they can go to Cuba,'' said Pamela Falk, a professor of international law at the City University of New York law school. ''Most Americans can fit into one of the legitimate categories.''</p>
        <p>Vicki Huddleston, the top American diplomat in Cuba, said in Los Angeles this month that the goal is to channel information and ideas. ''No island can remain an island with open communication,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But some supporters of the trade ban are skeptical.</p>
        <p>''I don't see the benefits of the people to people policy,'' said Representative Robert Menendez, a Cuban-American Democrat from New Jersey. ''There have been hundreds of thousands of visitors and millions of dollars spent, and Castro has become more oppressive.''</p>
        <p>In May 1999, the administration for the first time gave about 150 universities, as well as high schools, religious groups and other organizations, the authority to license their members for travel to Cuba.</p>
        <p>Groups that formerly clashed with Treasury Department officials over the travel restrictions say their fortunes have changed. When the San Francisco-based group Global Exchange staged a protest trip by 200 Americans in 1994, Treasury Department authorities confiscated passports and froze the group's bank account. Today, Global Exchange is licensed to take Americans on tours to attend film festivals, conduct language courses, even take an ecological bike trip, said Pam Montanaro, a trip coordinator.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Americans who do not bother to get government approval face little risk of prosecution, administration officials said.</p>
        <p>Unauthorized travelers include everyone from Cuban-Americans -- who run afoul of the rules by traveling more than the approved one family visit a year -- to beachcombers, fishermen, political activists, sex tourists and others. Though about 22,000 Americans traveled illegally to Cuba last year, Treasury Department authorities levied only about 200 civil penalties, officials said. And they did not refer a single case to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.</p>
        <p>More than 100 cases of suspected travel violations have languished for months because defense lawyers have demanded hearings for their clients and the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control has no judges to conduct them.</p>
        <p>The travel restrictions in reality are curbs on spending money in Cuba. Authorized American travelers are allowed to spend up to $183 a day. Unapproved visitors who spend cash could face up to 10 years in prison, $1 million in corporate fines, $250,000 in individual fines or civil penalties up to $55,000 per violation.</p>
        <p>Federal authorities admit that their contradictory mandate -- to make authorized travel easier while impeding tourism -- makes the restrictions on Cuban travel some of the most difficult to enforce. Yet they insist the law remains an effective deterrent for most Americans.</p>
        <p>Enforcement is complicated because many of the unauthorized travelers fly to Cuba through third countries, like the Bahamas, Canada or Mexico. Eager for the foreigners' cash, Cuba obliges Americans by failing to stamp their passports.</p>
        <p>That leaves United States authorities to rely largely on the honor system to determine which travelers have broken the law.</p>
        <p>Some analysts say the increased legal travel is already building bridges between Americans and Cubans. The American tide is ''keeping the Cuban government off balance,'' especially as it seeks to attract investment but maintain control, said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council in New York, a nonprofit center financed by businesses that seek to understand opportunities in Cuba.</p>
        <p>But those seeking to maintain the economic pressure on Cuba are dismayed by growing signs that American tourism is becoming mainstream. Urban bookstores offer a dozen guidebooks to Cuba; rental villas in Cuba are offered on the Internet by an agency based in Austin, Texas; the Web site of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, the youth-oriented clothing company, offers tips on how to ''go play'' in Cuba, while noting that ''it's technically illegal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Menendez, the New Jersey lawmaker, said American visitors are spending time on the beach and in nightclubs -- not engaging the island's dissidents or independent journalists. He accused the administration of ''casting an economic lifeline to the regime'' in Havana to ease economic pressures there and avert a social explosion, which in turn, could produce a refugee exodus.</p>
