        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your front-page series ''How Race Is Lived in America,'' beginning June 4:</p>
        <p>Having grown up in Mississippi in the 1940's and 50's, I can understand why whites are much less willing to talk about race. It's much harder to talk about when you know you are in the wrong. I hate the prejudices that are still a part of me because of the environment that I grew up in, although I am a giant stride ahead of the generation before me.</p>

        <p>My prayer is that African-Americans will bear with me as I try to do my best with my prejudices and that I will do the same when they exhibit their prejudice against whites. Both races must accept where the other has come from, right or wrong. We are here now and would be wise to look forward rather than backward.</p>
