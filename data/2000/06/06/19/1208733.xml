        <p>Tiger Woods looked natural making unforgettable shots, he looked natural making history, and it seemed natural that Woods, the world's best player, won the 100th United States Open today in record-setting fashion. Woods was making a dramatic statement that his skills have never been in more perfect harmony.</p>
        <p>On a picture-perfect day at Pebble Beach, one of golf's most sacred locations, Woods finished with a 12-under-par total of 272 to win the Open by a record-setting 15 strokes over Ernie Els of South Africa and Miguel Angel Jimenez of Spain, who tied for second place at three over par.</p>
        <p>It was the largest victory margin in a major championship, surpassing the 13-stroke margin by Old Tom Morris at the 1862 British Open. The winning margin also broke the United States Open record that had stood for 101 years, surpassing the 11-stroke victory by Willie Smith in 1899.</p>
        <p>Woods also set the record for lowest score in relation to par (12 strokes), breaking the previous record of eight under par set by Ben Hogan in 1948 and equaled by Jack Nicklaus in 1980, and Lee Janzen in 1993 and three others. And Woods's winning total of 272 tied the all-time winning totals set by Nicklaus and Janzen.</p>
        <p>Woods has now won two majors by record-setting margins, his 12-stroke victory at the Masters in 1997, and today's victory, which left a huge gap between him and a world-class field. When Woods reached 12 under par by making a 10-foot birdie putt at the par-5 14th hole, he became only the second player to reach 12 under in Open history, tying Gil Morgan, who did it in 1992.</p>
        <p>But unlike Morgan, who faded and lost the 1992 Open to Tom Kite, Woods turned this event into an affirmation of his skills, leaving people shaking their heads in awe.</p>
        <p>At 24, Woods has already won three major championships -- the Masters in 1997, the P.G.A. Championship last year and today's victory at the Open. His ambition is to be remembered as the greatest player ever. And today, he completed one of golf's great performances.</p>
        <p>''The Masters and the P.G.A. Championship were special wins, but to win our national championship, being an American, is a great feeling,'' said Woods, who won three consecutive United States Amateur championships (1994 to 1996), and who has 23 victories worldwide since turning professional in 1996.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to describe the thoughts that are going through your mind. You grow up dreaming of beating all the best players, and then you're walking down that fairway about to win. It was a great feeling.''</p>
        <p>When Woods won the Masters, it was a stunning performance by a 22-year-old who overpowered Augusta National Golf Club with his length, while making putts from all over the greens. But this victory was perhaps more impressive. The golf course was more difficult. It required more accuracy off the tee, more course management and more patience.</p>
        <p>The Open has often been called golf's most demanding test, and Woods passed it easily, like a class valedictorian.</p>
        <p>The outcome was all but decided Saturday morning, when Woods took a record-breaking six-stroke lead after two rounds. At that point, the rest of the field needed strokes, and Woods was not giving any.</p>
        <p>There was a time, when Woods first turned professional, when people wondered if he had the game to win an Open, whether he had enough accuracy off the tee, or enough control with his short irons, or enough patience. Those questions have been silenced. Woods can win on any golf course that has tee boxes, fairways and greens.</p>
        <p>Only Nicklaus, who won three different majors by age 23, has won three different majors quicker than Woods. And at next month's British Open at St. Andrews, Scotland, the birthplace of golf, Woods will attempt to complete the career Grand Slam, winning all four majors faster than anyone else.</p>
        <p>On today's final hole, Pebble Beach's picturesque par-5, 543-yard No. 18, the drama surrounded whether Woods would break the scoring record of 272. After his tee shot and a lay-up approach, Woods hit his third onto the green, about 15 feet left of the hole, giving him a chance to putt for birdie and a record 271.</p>
        <p>As Woods walked to the green, he removed his hat to acknowledge the roaring gallery, and some fans dropped to their knees and bowed repeatedly. Woods missed the putt for birdie, but he made the next putt for par, settling for a 272 total, one of the few things Woods settled for during an amazing four-day performance.</p>
        <p>''It was just one of those great weeks,'' said Woods, who won for the fifth time this year, including his last two starts. ''I made a lot of putts, big putts that I really needed that kept my momentum going.''</p>
        <p>Starting the day at eight under par, Woods parred his way through the front nine, then provided more memories on his triumphant march to the Open trophy.</p>
        <p>At No. 10, Woods made a 12-foot putt for his first birdie of the day. That one putt seemed to send a charge through Woods's body, just as it sent a charge through the gallery.</p>
        <p>Two holes later, Woods made an 18-foot putt for birdie, to reach 10 under par.</p>
        <p>Then at the par-4 No. 13, Woods hit another incredible shot, an iron approach that nearly went into the hole, passing by the left side of the cup and stopping less than 2 feet from the hole. Woods tapped in for another birdie that moved him to 11 under par.</p>
        <p>At that point, one could sense the momentum building. Woods made a another birdie at the par-5 No. 14, chipping to 8 feet on his third shot, then making still another putt. At No. 16, Woods just missed a 15-foot putt by less than a foot that would have moved him to 13 under par.</p>
        <p>Then at No. 17, Woods saved par with a superb bunker shot that settled just a foot from the cup, another display of his almost magical touch around the green.</p>
        <p>Then came the finish, with Woods taking his well-deserved walk down the last fairway, soaking in the adulation.</p>
        <p>It was a week filled with emotion. The absence of Payne Stewart, the defending champion who was killed in a plane crash last October, was felt by the entire field, and Nicklaus, who missed the cut, bid a tearful farewell to the gallery at No. 18 on Friday, playing perhaps his final major.</p>
        <p>But the mantle of golf's most dominant player is clearly worn by Woods. And at the 100th Open, everyone else was truly playing for second place.</p>
        <p>''The highest point?'' asked a puzzled Woods, when asked for his highest and lowest points of the week. ''I never really had a low point.''</p>
