        <p>Bob Thirkield of Cincinnati paced in the terminal at Kennedy International Airport on Saturday evening like an expectant father in a hospital waiting room.</p>
        <p>''I always feel like I'm about to have a baby when I do this,'' said Mr. Thirkield, 76, a retired businessman and sometime pilot, tugging at his  collar and nervously clutching a bottle of Diet Coke.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thirkield was one of 26 pilots, all volunteers, awaiting the arrival of 154 ''children of Chernobyl,'' who were sickened by the aftermath of the worst nuclear accident in history. The pilots were to fly the children, ages 8 to 15, to American host families scattered across the United States for a summer of medical care and relaxation.</p>
        <p>While these children are not terminally ill, their health suffers from the fallout of the 1986 disaster, when fire ripped through a nuclear reactor in Ukraine, killing 28 people outright and spewing radiation over vast stretches of northeastern Europe. Over the years, the high levels of radiation lingering in the area have caused thousands of deaths and illnesses, particularly thyroid cancer.</p>
        <p>Though many of these children were not even born when the accident occurred, they are plagued with mouth sores and respiratory problems and are prone to illnesses because of their weakened immune systems. Here, the children are to receive basic medical care -- visits to pediatricians, eye doctors and dentists -- which their families cannot afford at home.</p>
        <p>This was Mr. Thirkield's third year as a volunteer pilot for the eight-week program, sponsored by Children of Chernobyl, a nonprofit group based in Youngstown, Ohio, and AirLifeLine, a group of volunteer pilots who give poor patients free flights to receive medical care.</p>
        <p>''They are like my children,'' Mr. Thirkield said. ''By the end of the summer, their eyes shine a little bit brighter. You ask them what their favorite food is, and they say McDonald's and pizza.''</p>
        <p>The program began in 1992 with 11 children. Since then, with more  American families willing to be hosts, the number of children has grown steadily, said Joe Knable, 44, the president of Children of Chernobyl.</p>
        <p>''We want them to enjoy themselves here, go back to Chernobyl and become leaders in their own communities,'' Mr. Knable said. ''The fact that their parents are willing to send them on a plane to a country they themselves have never been to, to have them spend a summer with a family they've never met, says something about how much these children need this.''</p>
        <p>For many of the children, this was their first time away from home, and for some, who had been helped by the program before, it was a much-anticipated return trip. One child draped himself in an American flag, and another sported a T-shirt plastered with the boy band 'N Sync, her favorite American singing group.</p>
        <p>Back home the children have little access to clean air and water. Mr. Thirkield said that one girl he had flown kept a hedgehog as a pet, because she said it ate the rats that infested her house.</p>
        <p>Anastasia Sergeeva, 10, who made the trip last year from Minsk, in Belarus, said through a translator that everything here was ''brighter and shinier.'' She said she made so many new friends during her trip last year that she could not ''count them on my fingers and toes.''</p>
        <p>''But America is not my home,'' she said. ''There's so much fun in America. I know I will always have fun here, but I have lots of responsibilities that I need to still do in my hometown.''</p>
        <p>Sergei Volochkovich, 11, arrived yesterday after traveling more than 30 hours from Chechelnyk, his village in Ukraine. ''I cannot believe I am finally here,'' he said. He still had more traveling to do to get to his host family in Ohio, but Sergei said he did not care. Dropping his duffel bag on the ground, he stretched his arms out and twirled.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 20, 2000, Tuesday  An article yesterday about ''children of Chernobyl'' visiting the United States for a summer of medical care and relaxation referred imprecisely to the number of deaths and illnesses caused by the accident at the nuclear plant in Ukraine in 1986. As was noted in a correction in this space on Saturday, referring to an article published on June 6, the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has said that 31 people died in the first weeks after the accident. Other estimates of deaths ultimately caused by it range from dozens to tens of thousands; estimates of illnesses range from hundreds to tens of thousands.</p>
