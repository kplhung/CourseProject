        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Representative Nydia M. Velazquez provides a rationale for eliminating the federal estate tax (Op-Ed, June 15), but she doesn't mention one factor that accounts for its unpopularity among people at all socioeconomic levels.</p>
        <p>The estate tax is imposed on the accumulated wealth of a financially successful person when that person dies, even though part of that wealth has already been taxed as annual income when it was received and part of that wealth is unrealized capital gain on assets that have not been sold.</p>

        <p>Representative Nydia M. Velazquez provides a rationale for eliminating the federal estate tax (Op-Ed, June 15), but she doesn't mention one factor that accounts for its unpopularity among people at all socioeconomic levels.</p>
        <p>The estate tax is imposed on the accumulated wealth of a financially successful person when that person dies, even though part of that wealth has already been taxed as annual income when it was received and part of that wealth is unrealized capital gain on assets that have not been sold.</p>
        <p>The tax therefore violates two basic principles of tax fairness: that income can be taxed only once by a taxing authority and that capital gains cannot be taxed until they are realized, that is, until underlying assets are actually sold at a profit.</p>
