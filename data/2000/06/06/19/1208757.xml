        <p>Miguel Angel Jimenez had never been happier to finish 15 strokes behind.</p>
        <p>Playing his first tournament at Pebble Beach, Jimenez tied for second place with Ernie Els at three over par, 15 strokes behind Tiger Woods, who won the 100th United States Open in record-setting fashion.

        <p>Miguel Angel Jimenez had never been happier to finish 15 strokes behind.</p>
        <p>Playing his first tournament at Pebble Beach, Jimenez tied for second place with Ernie Els at three over par, 15 strokes behind Tiger Woods, who won the 100th United States Open in record-setting fashion. For Woods, it was an unforgettable weekend. But it was for Jimenez, as well, a 36-year-old Spaniard who recorded his highest finish in a major championship and won $391,150.</p>
        <p>''I feel great finishing second in this tournament,'' said Jimenez, who entered the Open ranked 20th in the world. ''Tiger Woods was playing a different tournament after two rounds. I feel after two rounds, I was playing against everybody else. He played great. It was a great performance.''</p>
        <p>Three of the top six finishers were Europeans: besides Jimenez, there was Lee Westwood of England and Padraig Harrington of Ireland, who finished tied for fifth place at five over par. Tony Jacklin of England was the last European to win a United States Open, in 1980, but Jimenez was not surprised by the strong showing.</p>
        <p>''It says something about the quality of players all over the world,'' he said. ''On this course, you need to concentrate and keep your intensity all the time.''</p>
        <p>As for Els, who has won two United States Open titles (1994 and 1997), he had a unique experience playing in today's last group with Woods.</p>
        <p>''He dominated from Day One,'' Els said. ''From the first hole, he started dominating and never let go. I had the privilege to play with him. When you have a guy playing like that, you have no chance.''</p>
        <p>Asked about his own performance, Els said: ''I played one good round of golf. But if I played out of my mind, I probably still would have lost by five, six, or seven.''</p>
