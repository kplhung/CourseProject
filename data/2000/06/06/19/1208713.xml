        <p>Christina Zarek, a Pennsylvania Democratic campaign aide, was a little crestfallen. ''Five graphs,'' she said as she mingled with reporters on Wednesday at a medical center in Scranton, where Vice President Al Gore was speaking. ''It took up the first five graphs.''</p>
        <p>What brought out Ms. Zarek's gloom was the front-page report in The Tribune, the Scranton daily, about Mr. Gore's appearance at an airport rally here the night before. In a speech to 400 supporters, Mr. Gore had introduced a Democrat running in a critical special legislative election as John Wansacz.</p>
        <p>The problem was, the candidate's name was Jim. And The Tribune devoted the first five paragraphs of its lead article to the goof.</p>
        <p>That was one of several dispiriting media moments last week for the vice president, a week that his staff had been certain would be a winner for him. With Gov. George W. Bush on hiatus at the family compound in Kennebunkport, Me., Mr. Gore took the opportunity to unveil his ''prosperity and progress tour,'' a multiweek drive to revive his flagging campaign by reminding voters of what some strategists say has the potential to be a Gore trump card: the Clinton administration's economic record.</p>
        <p>But the message never seemed to sink in. An announcement of the tour at the New-York Historical Society in Manhattan proved to be short on the details Mr. Gore had promised about what he would do with the government's quickly growing surplus. The national news media was so unimpressed that ABC News did not even feature the event on its nightly newscast, and while some national dailies, including The New York Times, played it on the bottom half of Page 1 the next day, USA Today and The Los Angeles Times put it inside.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's campaign spokesman, Chris Lehane, said the ho-hum play was not a major concern; there would be ample time, he explained, for readers and viewers to absorb the message of the prosperity tour. But on Thursday, as Mr. Gore was planning to discuss some of the policy details missing from the tour's kickoff, another day was lost when Tony Coelho stepped down as campaign manager. That move, which revived impressions of a campaign in frequent turmoil, dominated the news coverage, leaving some Gore advisers in a state of frustration.</p>
        <p>''It's not a good thing,'' said one aide who demanded anonymity. ''But how bad a thing will be determined by how disciplined we stay. If we're able to get through the next 48 hours, then we have a whole new series of events to try to make lemonade out of lemons.''</p>
        <p>The shake-up, in fact, was the dominant political news story on the Sunday morning talk shows. William M. Daley, the campaign's new chairman, appeared on at least five of them to try to refute the suggestion that Mr. Gore was in trouble. On the CBS News program ''Face the Nation,'' Mr. Daley said the campaign dynamic would shift as the pressure built on Mr. Bush to elaborate on his proposals. ''Then we will begin to see the contrast,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The confluence of events last week sometimes seemed out of any handler's control. The Scranton visit, for example, had another unexpected complication when Mercy Hospital, affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, at the last minute withdrew an invitation to the vice president to speak after Bishop James C. Timlin cited Mr. Gore's support for abortion rights. ''No Mercy for Gore,'' The Tribune said.</p>
        <p>The week also illustrated what is in the view of some Democrats and Republicans alike Mr. Gore's surprisingly tough struggle to get out a message that clicks with voters.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to say 'smothered in the crib,' '' Tom Hannon, the political director of CNN, said of the Coelho development's deflating effect just as the prosperity tour was getting started. ''But the timing from their standpoint is not very felicitous. This is clearly going to step on their rolling out of the new Al Gore look.''</p>
        <p>Though it is early in the campaign, polls show Mr. Bush's numbers rising at Mr. Gore's expense, a reflection in part of the Bush campaign's seeming ability over the past several weeks to dominate the news coverage with policy declarations.</p>
        <p>''How perceptions are changed begins with the way the day-to-day press covers the candidacy,'' said Greg Stevens, who was the media consultant to Senator John McCain, a presidential candidate known for enjoying the give-and-take with reporters. ''The interesting thing to me is that Gore in person is a pretty engaging person. But that certainly does not come across at all in the exposure in the media.''</p>
        <p>Why Mr. Gore has not established a more winning presence in the news media is, of course, a subjective question. The topic has a chicken-or-egg component: is the press taking its cue from the polls in shaping its depiction of him, or are the people answering pollsters' queries based on conclusions drawn from newspapers and the nightly news?</p>
        <p>To Mr. Lehane, a candidate's ups and downs are partly a function of the predictable ebb and flow of a campaign and the desire of the press corps to build up and tear down. ''I think there's a natural cycle to all these campaigns,'' he said. He added that in the current instance, the ''serious'' nature of the issues on which Mr. Gore would be concentrating on the tour did not lend itself to sensational coverage.</p>
        <p>But some political observers say the problem goes deeper, that Mr. Gore has never managed to shed his wooden image and that he tries too hard to ingratiate himself. During his remarks at the Allied Services medical center, where the campaign moved its event after Mercy rescinded its invitation, Mr. Gore told the gathering: ''Tipper says hello. She enjoyed very much her trip to Scranton. She came back really glowing.''</p>
        <p>Even the words ''prosperity and progress'' earn talk-show snickers. ''Very hip,'' David Letterman wisecracked on Wednesday night. '' 'Progress and prosperity': his campaign slogan is from the '39 World's Fair.''</p>
        <p>Some commentators say Mr. Gore's tight handling of the news media has helped create negative impressions. Mr. Gore frequently gives one-on-one interviews with television anchors in local markets, and during his daylong visit to Scranton he was ushered into a stuffy equipment room at the medical center for a series of rapid-fire satellite interviews with anchors in places like Evansville, Ind., and Parkersburg, W.Va.</p>
        <p>But reporters who travel with Mr. Gore regularly say they get to ask him questions in a news conference setting less than once a week. In such a tightly controlled environment, people in the news business say, it is not surprising that reporters grasp for any development that does not follow the script -- and that blunders, no matter how innocent, get magnified, as when a candidate gets a local politician's first name wrong.</p>
        <p>Mark Halperin, the political director for ABC News, suggested that the fairly uninspiring initial response to the prosperity tour by the national press grew out of a general mistrust of the campaign's repeated efforts to reinvent Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''The vice president, unfortunately for him, is not cut much slack,'' Mr. Halperin said. ''I think the Bush campaign has gotten some traction in saying, 'This is just Al Gore Version 6.0.' How many more times can they let the guy say that this is the start of the campaign?''</p>
        <p>Democrats say, however, that with an emphasis on prosperity, Mr. Gore may have finally found a word he can repeat to his heart's content, one that has enduring power beyond the media's ability to discredit it. ''This is the message that Gore has to be on,'' declared Paul Begala, a former adviser to President Clinton and now a host of ''Equal Time'' on CNBC. ''I will say that when he focused on Elian Gonzalez, I was very unhappy. Now he's got the right focus.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the vice president's boosters think the issue plays so well for him that even the most skeptical articles can work in his favor. As Joe Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, put it, ''Every single one of those process stories will contain the words 'peace,'  'prosperity' and 'Al Gore.' ''</p>
