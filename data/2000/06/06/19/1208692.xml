        <p>The Clinton administration is exploring with some of its NATO allies and Russia the possibility that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia be allowed to leave office with guarantees for his safety and his savings, senior American and NATO officials say.</p>
        <p>The discussions are delicate and informal, the officials stress, emphasizing that the administration is not preparing any offer to Mr. Milosevic -- who has been indicted by an international war crimes tribunal -- and will not make one.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, ''if we were presented with a hard and fast offer that would get Milosevic out of power, we'd have to think very hard before saying 'no,' '' a senior administration official said.</p>
        <p>Another senior official said that the United States would condemn any proposal that would allow Mr. Milosevic to go anywhere but to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. ''That's the policy,'' the official said. ''But 'Would we act to stop it or quietly acquiesce?' is another question,'' the official said, then added carefully: ''There has been no formal discussion of this -- that I am aware of.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic raised the question of his future last summer, after the war over Kosovo ended, officials say. But Washington rebuffed any discussion of a deal.</p>
        <p>Various proposals have been raised to Washington and Athens in recent weeks by emissaries saying they come from Mr. Milosevic, the officials said. But what is less clear is whether they are fully authorized, and whether Mr. Milosevic is serious about doing a deal, or simply trying to ''see how the ground lies,'' an American official said. ''What we would never do is make him an offer, because he'll just pocket it.''</p>
        <p>Any deal, even without clear American fingerprints, would also put Vice President Al Gore into a difficult position during the presidential campaign and could undermine the international tribunal that indicted Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>It is also not clear why Mr. Milosevic would choose to leave power now, the officials caution. While his position is slowly disintegrating, along with Yugoslavia's economy, his current seat is probably the safest place for him. ''It would be hard for him to trust assurances from anyone, inside or outside the country,'' an official said.</p>
        <p>Within his ruling party, Mr. Milosevic has said that it is important to wait out the Clinton administration, and that a President George W. Bush  would be more ''realistic'' toward Serbia and carry less personal animosity from the Kosovo war.</p>
        <p>Still, President Clinton raised the issue of Mr. Milosevic's future with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, at their recent summit meeting, Russian officials have told some NATO-country officials. According to the Russians, Mr. Putin told Mr. Clinton that Miami seemed as good a place for Mr. Milosevic as Moscow, the officials said.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has made the ouster of Mr. Milosevic one of its main policy goals and regards him as the central obstacle to democratization and stability in southeastern Europe. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has told her top aides she wants Mr. Milosevic out of office before she goes, yet Mr. Milosevic has frustrated Washington, outflanking the opposition.</p>
        <p>''There is keen interest in these proposals in Washington,'' said a NATO-country official. ''They can't be seen to be shopping. But they are sending signals that should a clear proposal come, it would be seriously entertained. And that shows they're serious. If you write about it, it will be full denial. But it's the best solution for everyone, and they could spin it as victory, as his head on a platter. There is a strong argument that democracy should be put ahead of the person.''</p>
        <p>Greece is one of the countries actively exploring the possibility of a deal for Mr. Milosevic's ouster, which could mean exile abroad for him and his family or, less likely, pledges of safety inside Serbia from any successor government that promises not to extradite him.</p>
        <p>Orthodox Greece provided humanitarian aid to Serbia and Kosovo even during the air war and has acted as a go-between for NATO and Belgrade in the past.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Milosevic saw the former Greek foreign minister, Karolos Papoulias, and some important Greek businessmen, including some with close ties to the United States. Mr. Milosevic is said to have asked to see former Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, whom he trusts, but officials say that they are looking for more signals of seriousness from Belgrade before Mr. Mitsotakis would be authorized to go.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Milosevic is beleaguered and unpopular, and the country is having severe economic problems, the Serbian opposition is weak and there are no signs of potential insurrection. The army and the police have not cracked. Russia and China, which opposed NATO's use of force in Kosovo and have interests in Serbia, have been willing to help Mr. Milosevic and his government with credits, loans and energy supplies.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the officials say, Mr. Milosevic is showing signs of nervousness. He is not seeing a broad range of people or traveling widely inside the country; there is evidence of a grain shortage that will drive up food prices; and there have been a series of assassinations of senior officials and criminal leaders, none of them solved, that indicate instability.</p>
        <p>The opposition is becoming more of a widespread movement inside Serbia, with opinion polls showing a growing desire for change and an end to international isolation, even if the current leaders of the opposition are not popular themselves.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, international sanctions against Yugoslavia are becoming better coordinated and seem to be biting those close to the government. Just last week, officials say, Cyprus, a favored spot for Serbian money and money laundering, finally agreed to shut down the office of Beogradska Banka on technical grounds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic and his family are believed to have large amounts of money in foreign banks, although the size and location of the holdings are not known.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic seems tired and irritable, the officials say, and they note that his speeches have a kind of ideological fury more reminiscent of the views of his influential wife, Mirjana Markovic, a professor of sociology who founded the Yugoslav United Left Party.</p>
        <p>Some in his own party are said to be looking beyond him, and the security of his family -- especially his son, Marko, who is involved in a wide range of business activities -- is a concern.</p>
        <p>Marko Milosevic, although on a list of individuals banned from travel to European Union countries, was recently in Greece on a false diplomatic passport, one official said, and he is now believed to be in Japan, possibly on his way to China.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Milosevic's conviction that a Bush administration would be more realistic and less emotional toward him, a Bush foreign policy adviser cautioned that there was no agreed policy, and that the situation in Serbia could change a lot in six months.</p>
        <p>''But Milosevic should take no comfort from the prospect of a Bush administration,'' the adviser said. ''There will be no sense of letting bygones be bygones. The strategy may change in different ways, and it will be worked out with the Europeans. But the idea that a bunch of Kissingerian realpolitikers will focus energy elsewhere and let him mind his own business is not something he should bank on.''</p>
