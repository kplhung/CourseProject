        <p>The first time that George W. Bush was arrested, he had just stolen a Christmas wreath.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, then a 20-year-old junior at Yale, was head of a notoriously rambunctious fraternity, and with the Christmas holidays approaching, he and some of his buddies had declared themselves the ''decorating committee.'' They took off for a festive shopping street, where Mr. Bush spotted the wreath in a hotel -- and stole it.</p>
        <p>It was not the perfect crime. Mr. Bush later recalled that he and his friends had perhaps had a few beers and were loud and boisterous. In addition, a police car was approaching.</p>
        <p>The police arrested Mr. Bush and charged him with disorderly conduct. Eventually the charges were dropped, but the episode underscored Mr. Bush's path through the uproar of the late 1960's: at a time when many university students risked arrest for their vociferous political protests, Mr. Bush broke the law not out of principle but for a prank. Others denounced the police as ''pigs,'' while Mr. Bush instinctively stood with the establishment, even as he casually breached its law.</p>
        <p>Born at the earliest fringe of the baby boom, Mr. Bush was pressed during his years at Yale, 1964 to 1968, to take sides in the great battles then unfolding over politics, civil rights, drugs and music. Mostly he was a noncombatant in those upheavals, but when forced to choose, he ultimately retreated to the values and ideals established by his parents' generation, and to their accepted methods of rebelling.</p>
        <p>In short, while some students took to the barricades, Mr. Bush took to the bar.</p>
        <p>Unlike others of his generation, like Bill Clinton or Al Gore, Mr. Bush never wore his hair long, agonized over Vietnam, wrestled with existentialism or cranked up Rolling Stones songs to annoy his parents (instead of hard rock music, he listened to soul). Even today, Mr. Bush thunders in his stump speeches against boomer-style self-indulgence and appeals for a ''responsibility era'' that in some respects sounds like the 1950's; he likes values as clean-cut as his hair.</p>
        <p>Many young people of privilege who encountered the 1960's began to question the system and their own values; Mr. Bush seems to have grasped his more tightly than ever. He may have broken the law, but he never questioned it. And today, much of his underlying political philosophy rests on the belief that the nation still needs to reverse the psychology of permissiveness and liberalism that began to take root in the country in the late 1960's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was a rabble-rouser of sorts, but only in the high-spirited way that fraternity boys a generation earlier had swallowed goldfish or sat on flagpoles. For all the buffeting that late-night television has given Mr. Bush over questions of drug use, he was in most respects a very conventional young man, and classmates say they do not recall him ever using marijuana or other illegal drugs.</p>
        <p>One of the very few differences in mores between Mr. Bush and his parents came with changing patterns of courtship, for Mr. Bush busied himself with a string of girlfriends, while his father and mother both had married the only person they had ever kissed. Indeed, like many of his conservative peers, the only revolution for which the younger Bush ever demonstrated any enthusiasm was the sexual one.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Bush was frolicking around Yale, a young man named Al Gore was studying at Harvard. But they were very different. Mr. Gore had barely arrived on campus when he began going around the dormitories, campaigning for a spot on the freshman council; later, he spent his time worrying about Vietnam. He was, in short, just the kind of serious and self-important student whom the less reputable Mr. Bush liked to mock.</p>
        <p>''Can you imagine how much it hurt,'' Mr. Bush once joked to a crowd, ''to know that Dad's idea of the perfect son was Al Gore?''</p>
        <p>Excelling in Personal Relations</p>
        <p>The Yale years can help address one of the fundamental questions often raised by critics of Mr. Bush: is he smart enough to be president?</p>
        <p>The answer among those who knew him best is overwhelming and indignant -- absolutely. Many friends are angry that people even ask the question.</p>
        <p>''This guy is very smart,'' said Lanny J. Davis, a former special counsel to President Clinton and a supporter of Al Gore, as well as a fraternity brother of Mr. Bush at Yale. ''This notion of lightness is totally missing the point. There are many smart people, intellectually smart as well as street smart, who don't have the energy or motivation at times to act smart, but that doesn't mean they're not smart. There are times when George coasted through Yale courses or through exams or seemed overly facetious. But don't mistake that for not being intellectually acute.</p>
        <p>''My memory of George -- and I've no reason to say nice things about him, because I hope he loses -- is that he was an astute observer of people and had an incredible talent for getting along with people,'' Mr. Davis said. ''I tell my fellow Democrats not to underestimate him.''</p>
        <p>The notion that Mr. Bush is a low-wattage leader seems to be based on two factors.</p>
        <p>First, Mr. Bush never was a strong student. His transcript at Yale, leaked to The New Yorker, shows that he was a solid C student. Although a history major, he sampled widely in the social sciences and did poorly in political science and economics while achieving some of his best grades (the equivalent of a B+) in philosophy and anthropology. (The anthropology class, however, was taught by Margaret Mead that year and was enormously popular because she offered among the easiest grades at Yale.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was not much of a student of politics, for he earned only a 73 in Introduction to the American Political System and a 71 in Introduction to International Relations. Few, if any, professors seem to have left a mark on him, or he on them.</p>
        <p>Several professors who taught him said he had simply been one student in a huge class. As the historian John Morton Blum put it, ''I haven't the foggiest recollection of him.'' Erich Segal, who later met Mr. Gore at Harvard and based the main character in ''Love Story'' partly on him, taught a classical comedy course that Mr. Bush took, but Mr. Segal said he had no memory of him.</p>
        <p>The transcript indicates that in Mr. Bush's freshman year, the only year for which rankings were available, he was in the 21st percentile of his class, meaning that four-fifths of the students had better grades than he did.</p>
        <p>Second, Mr. Bush is determinedly nonintellectual. He never seems to want to play with ideas and hold them up to the light; he drops names like Nolan Ryan, not Kierkegaard.</p>
        <p>''I would agree that he's not contemplative or reflective,'' said Michael M. Wood, a friend at both Yale and, earlier, Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. ''He's not a guy who would go off by himself thinking of something. He's more likely to be hiding in a tree to jump down on somebody.''</p>
        <p>In a long interview about his past, Mr. Bush quickly became edgy when he was asked about the internal motivations and pressures that have driven him over the years.</p>
        <p>''Now that we've gotten into the kind of psychoanalyst world of trying to figure me out, I think it's -- I say that sarcastically because, you know, this is not the way I am,'' he said. ''I mean, I'm a doer. I'm a problem-solver. I get things done.''</p>
        <p>Yet if his mind was not well suited to earning A's at Yale by categorizing information and coming up with the four major and three minor reasons why Rome fell, then it may be that his brain works best in other ways. Mr. Wood and many other acquaintances say Mr. Bush brims with a practical intelligence.</p>
        <p>At the same time that he was earning C's at Yale, Mr. Bush demonstrated a feat that old friends still shake their heads about. It was his induction into the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, or DKE, and the sophomores were cowering downstairs in the fraternity's lovely red-brick building (now the alumni center) as older students hit them and shouted insults as part of the hazing process.</p>
        <p>''You're garbage!'' the pledges remember being told. ''You're pieces of'' excrement ''and you don't deserve to belong to this great fraternity.''</p>
        <p>Terry Johnson, a roommate of Mr. Bush who entered DKE at the same time, recalled: ''One of the techniques of demonstrating what an abominable person you are is to ask you to name all your fellow pledges. It's a way of humiliating somebody in front of their fellow pledges, to show that you're not worthy of entering DKE.''</p>
        <p>Several were called on and were able to name only 5 or 6 of the 55 pledges in the room. Then it was George Bush's turn. Those who were there say he named every single person.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush rose to be president of DKE, beating out, among others, his friend Roland W. Betts, later an eminently successful businessman. The DKE presidency was a significant achievement, and those who came before and after him as president did very well in the business world, largely because of the same people skills that propelled them to the top of DKE.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bush entered DKE, for example, the president of the fraternity was Frederick W. Smith, who founded Federal Express and remains its chairman and chief executive officer. The next president was Dayton Ogden, now chairman of Spencer Stuart, the executive search firm. Then came Mr. Bush, and after him was Michael M. Wood, now chief executive of Hanley-Wood, a publishing company in Washington.</p>
        <p>Those who remember Mr. Bush at DKE say he was similar to those other presidents, and that in the business world his people skills would have carried him far as well.</p>
        <p>Tension With an Eastern Elite</p>
        <p>For a leading presidential candidate, Mr. Bush has an unusually testy relationship with the Eastern establishment, although he also has an intimate history with it. His grandparents on both sides were card-carrying members of that establishment, yet ever since he showed up at Yale as a freshman in 1964, Mr. Bush has resolutely cultivated an anti-intellectualism and chafed at what he describes as the arrogance of liberal intellectual elitists.</p>
        <p>''Look, when you're coming from Texas to some of these schools up there,'' Mr. Bush said in an interview, ''there's a -- you know, I can't point to a particular person, but there's that sense of, you know: 'Well, maybe these boys from Texas aren't quite bright enough to be here. I guess it's geographic distribution that got him here.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush made clear that what irritated him about Yale above all was its reluctance, many years later, to give his father an honorary degree. After dithering while the elder Mr. Bush was vice president and then president, Yale finally awarded the degree to President Bush in 1991.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't politically correct,'' the younger Mr. Bush said. ''What kind of institution is that of higher learning? So I didn't react well to that.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Bush initially did not want to send a contribution to Yale on the occasion of his 25th reunion in 1993 (friends persuaded him to), and he did not submit an entry for his reunion class book.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's tension with what he sees as an arrogant Eastern elite, and his perception of himself as outside it, seem to have arisen initially from the clash of generations that occurred while he was at Yale. Mr. Bush entirely subscribed to his parents' and grandparents' view of absolute and immutable values, of privilege balanced by duty. He was proud when his grandfather, crusty old Senator Prescott Bush of Connecticut, denounced his party for considering Nelson Rockefeller for the presidential nomination in 1964, after Mr. Rockefeller had divorced his wife and remarried.</p>
        <p>Then, at Yale, this solid, straightforward world turned upside down. A moral universe of stark blacks and whites became colorized, ambiguous and, for young George, disorienting.</p>
        <p>Classmates began to feel guilty about their privilege, angry at their parents, distrustful of business and defiant at the system itself. For somebody like George W., entirely comfortable in his own skin, all this guilt and upheaval were incomprehensible.</p>
        <p>''I think what happened is still informing his public policy today,'' said Bill Minutaglio, one of Mr. Bush's biographers. ''He was blindsided by a lack of certitude that spun him and by an ambiguity that is still spinning him today.''</p>
        <p>''At Yale, watching all this unfold, I think it really hit him like a ton of bricks,'' Mr. Minutaglio added. ''He felt that Yale and a lot of the counterculture were rejecting all the things that his family had stood for.''</p>
        <p>Kingman Brewster Jr., the legendary president of Yale, moved to transform the university by admitting women beginning in 1968 and by restructuring admissions so that young men like George W. Bush, alumni children who were mediocre students, were far less likely to be accepted. Indeed, with his grades and college boards, Mr. Bush might not have been admitted if he had applied just a few years later.</p>
        <p>Just two months after Mr. Bush arrived at Yale, his father lost a closely watched Senate race in Texas to the incumbent, Ralph Yarborough. George W. had flown back to Texas for election night and watched as his father choked back his sorrow before a crowd in his concession speech.</p>
        <p>Soon afterward, George introduced himself to William Sloane Coffin Jr., the liberal chaplain at Yale, who had been a friend of his father. Mr. Coffin has said he does not recall the conversation, but as George W. remembers it, the chaplain said, ''Yeah, I know your father, and your father lost to a better man.''</p>
        <p>Young George watched wistfully from afar as his father, in the different political universe of Texas, basked in public respect and bounced back in 1966 to win a Congressional seat and be named president of the freshman class in the House. But as the elder Bush became more prominent as a Republican Congressman who supported the Vietnam War and opposed some civil rights legislation, he also became a target of criticism at Yale, deeply offending young George.</p>
        <p>''One time he came back to the room, and it was the only time I ever saw him perturbed,'' recalled Robert J. Dieter, a roommate at Yale. ''Somebody had attacked his dad over the Vietnam War. George had a hard time with what is now known as the politics of personal destruction, where you don't debate the merits of an issue but instead you attack the person. Apparently people had disparaged his father as a person, and that upset George a lot.''</p>
        <p>Oblivious to Politics of the Day</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's loyalty to his father in the Yale years was filial rather than political. For a son of a politician, Mr. Bush was remarkably oblivious to current affairs.</p>
        <p>Other undergraduates at the time -- like (future governor) George E. Pataki, (future senator) John Kerry, and (future federal judge) J. Harvie Wilkinson III -- were active in campus politics, while at the law school (future senator) Joseph I. Lieberman was beginning his own political career. But Mr. Bush was the opposite kind of student: he never joined the Yale Political Union and rarely spent time talking about civil rights, the Vietnam War or other upheavals of the day.</p>
        <p>''Gosh, I can't remember,'' Mr. Bush said, struggling to recall whether he had discussed these issues with his father. ''I mean, I'm confident we discussed issues. I just can't remember any long sessions sitting around.''</p>
        <p>''There wasn't a lot of protest at Yale in '68,'' he added. ''I don't remember that. And I think most people -- I don't know if you found anything differently -- I just don't remember any great days of rage. I think those were mainly in the 70's.''</p>
        <p>It is true that Yale did not explode until after the class of 1968 had graduated. But it is very odd to describe Yale in 1967-68 as ''a fairly placid period,'' as Mr. Bush does.</p>
        <p>Race riots erupted in New Haven between Mr. Bush's junior and senior years, antiwar ''teach-ins'' and protests multiplied, students burned draft cards and Mr. Coffin, the chaplain, was indicted for helping draft resisters. A group of nine students (including Strobe Talbott, now deputy secretary of state) circulated a statement among seniors saying that they would refuse to be drafted; Mr. Bush refused to sign it. The Yale Daily News captured the surly mood with an editorial headlined, ''Yale's Future, If Any.''</p>
        <p>Friendships as a Priority</p>
        <p>The upheaval may have left George W. Bush feeling uncomfortable, but he was not melancholy -- far from it. Friends remember him as cheerful, vigorously involved in intramural sports at Davenport, his residential college, and laughing with friends over beers.</p>
        <p>Roommates recall Mr. Bush studying the class register and memorizing names of classmates, and he clearly made friendships a great priority.</p>
        <p>''George probably knew 1,000 of the 4,000 undergraduates at Yale,'' said Mr. Betts, a friend. ''There probably was no one else who knew 200.''</p>
        <p>''He was the best-known guy at Yale,'' Mr. Betts added.</p>
        <p>Some other classmates regard that as a huge exaggeration, but even those who frowned on Mr. Bush, seeing him as an airhead party boy, tended to think of him as affable and unusually helpful to his friends.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Bush's roommates, Frederick C. Livingston, who had academic problems that led him to drop out for a year, said, ''Of all my roommates, he was the one most obviously concerned and open about seeing if he could help.''</p>
        <p>The DKE fraternity was a hub of Mr. Bush's life at Yale and offered a refuge from the upheavals of the day, and from the left.</p>
        <p>''You'd find people in DKE who were less likely to be subscribers of the left, more respectful of the institutions, not necessarily as disenchanted by the social fabric,'' said Paul B. Jones, a fraternity brother.</p>
        <p>Many athletes were in DKE, and it was famous for its parties, rowdiness and hazing. Former members say that the new pledges were paddled, battered and then shown a large iron brand glowing red hot in the fireplace. They were told to turn around to be branded, and then a much smaller brand (made of a wire hanger) was substituted to burn a triangle in the small of their backs, as the large brand was dipped into water to make a heart-stopping sizzle.</p>
        <p>Leftist disapproval of the fraternities was growing, and The Yale Daily News published an expose about hazing by DKE. In the ensuing uproar, Mr. Bush appeared in the newspaper for perhaps the only time, defending the branding as ''insignificant.''</p>
        <p>''I can't understand how the authors of the Friday article can assume that Yale has to be so haughty not to allow this type of pledging to go on at Yale,'' the newspaper quoted Mr. Bush as saying.</p>
        <p>Tapped for a Secret Society</p>
        <p>On April 28 of his junior year, as the bells on Harkness Tower sounded 8 p.m., a man strode over to Mr. Bush as he stood in the front courtyard of Davenport College. ''Skull and Bones!'' the man said, clapping his hands on Mr. Bush's shoulders. ''Accept or reject.''</p>
        <p>''I accept,'' Mr. Bush replied, and he was admitted to Skull and Bones, a secret society then made up of 15 of the most promising, talented or socially prominent men in each class. There have been reports that he was ''tapped'' by his father, who himself was a Bonesman, but that seems incorrect. An outgoing senior and Bonesman, David Alan Richards, acknowledges that it was he who tapped Mr. Bush that night.</p>
        <p>For a man like George W., who complains about elitism, Skull and Bones was an odd group to enter. It was the epitome of exclusivity, carefully choosing its members each year to undergo an elaborate initiation procedure in a windowless ''tomb'' that only members are allowed to enter, and the club was then being denounced as elitist by students and even by Dean Georges May. At least one classmate, Jacques R. Leslie Jr., turned it down that year, just as President Brewster had when he was an undergraduate.</p>
        <p>There has been speculation that Mr. Bush was admitted into Skull and Bones because of pressure from his father and grandfather. But the decision was made by the 15 departing members, albeit with some lobbying from past members, and what may have helped Mr. Bush more was that he was friends with one member of the outgoing group from DKE and knew three more from Davenport College.</p>
        <p>''George W. Bush was tapped because the members thought that he was a natural leader and a good guy to be with,'' Mr. Richards recalled. ''Legacy was helpful but it didn't determine the result.''</p>
        <p>If entry into Skull and Bones opened Mr. Bush to accusations of snobbery, it also meant association with a community of gifted people with whom Mr. Bush would form lifelong friendships -- and Mr. Bush's strategy at Yale was clearly to build great friendships, more than a great transcript. It was also a perfectly reasonable strategy, for one could argue that Yale graduates in the 1960's got further on the networks they made than on the grades they earned.</p>
        <p>That was certainly true of Mr. Bush. He was not quite John Belushi in ''Animal House,'' but like many of his DKE fraternity brothers, he did manage what could politely be called a full life. For starters, DKE was notorious for its rowdy weekend parties, attended by Yale men and by women from nearby women's colleges, in which alcohol was so plentiful that partygoers periodically threw up or passed out.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Livingston, his roommate, was married, Mr. Bush was an usher, and he led an effort to throw the groom and the fathers of the bride and groom into the swimming pool. Many years later, when Mr. Livingston's father was in a reception line and met Vice President Bush, he recalled the incident, saying, ''Your son once threw me into a swimming pool.''</p>
        <p>The vice president nodded sagely and replied, ''That sounds like George.''</p>
        <p>The theft of the Christmas wreath appears to have been Mr. Bush's first tangle with the police, but it was not the last. A year after that arrest, he was attending a football game at Princeton and cheering for his DKE brothers on the Yale team. At the end of the game, he and other students charged onto the football field and tried to knock down the goal posts, seizing pieces as souvenirs.</p>
        <p>The Princeton police tried to re-establish order and caught Mr. Bush brazenly sitting on a crossbar of a goal post, determinedly trying to pry off a piece for himself. The police seized him, interrogated him and finally released him on the condition that he leave Princeton by dusk.</p>
        <p>He has never been back.</p>
        <p>Once while on a train to New York City from New Haven, he told a buddy, James Lockhart, that he had done a lot of partying in his freshman year but that he now wanted to buckle down. As Mr. Lockhart remembers the conversation, Mr. Bush said, very seriously: ''I want to do more. I want to make a mark here.''</p>
        <p>Yet when Mr. Bush received his Yale diploma in 1968, he had third-rate grades, second-rate accomplishments and no firm career prospects.
