        <p>The strange case of lost and found nuclear secrets at Los Alamos National Laboratory took on a political edge today, as some Republican leaders in Congress called on Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to resign after yet another security lapse at the New Mexico laboratory.</p>
        <p>Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, said today that it was time for Mr. Richardson to take responsibility for the security breaches and resign.</p>
        <p>''He should step down, he should be responsible,'' Mr. Shelby said in an interview on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.'' ''I don't believe he's served his president well, and I don't believe he's served his nation well.''</p>
        <p>Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona and a member of the intelligence panel, also called for Mr. Richardson's resignation, while the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, complained that Mr. Richardson had ''not been paying attention to this problem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson rejected the calls for his resignation, saying on the ABC News program ''This  Week'' that stepping down would be ''walking away'' from a problem that he had vowed to fix.</p>
        <p>''I will take responsibility to clean up this mess,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The attacks came after a long week for Mr. Richardson, the Energy Department and the Los Alamos laboratory. Officials at Los Alamos announced on Monday that two computer hard drives containing nuclear weapons data were missing, and that employees had waited more than three weeks to report their disappearance.</p>
        <p>On Friday afternoon, Mr. Richardson announced that the hard drives had reappeared under equally mysterious circumstances. They were discovered behind a copying machine in an area of the laboratory that had been repeatedly searched by the F.B.I. and the Energy Department.</p>
        <p>The hard drives were used to store nuclear weapons data needed by the Nuclear Emergency Search Team, which responds to nuclear accidents and nuclear-related threats. The drives contained design information about nuclear weapons from China, France, Russia and the United States that could be used by the team to disarm the weapons.</p>
        <p>The two drives were flown to Washington from Los Alamos after they were found, and they were being examined electronically to determine if they had been tampered with or if the data had been compromised.</p>
        <p>''I believe there's been no espionage,'' Mr. Richardson said on the NBC program ''Meet the Press.''</p>
        <p>The mystery surrounding the hard drives came a year after questions first came up over lax security at Los Alamos in the wake of the Wen Ho Lee case.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee was a scientist at Los Alamos who was investigated in connection with allegations that China had stolen nuclear data. He was fired in March 1999 for security violations and was arrested in December on charges of mishandling classified material after it was discovered that he had downloaded and copied vast amounts of nuclear weapons data from the classified computer network at Los Alamos.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Lee was never charged with espionage, and the accusations that the Chinese had stolen design information about America's most advanced nuclear warhead have not been proved.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shelby and other Republican lawmakers said today that Mr. Richardson had repeatedly assured Congress that security at Los Alamos had been improved in the wake of the Wen Ho Lee case. They also noted that Mr. Richardson had opposed Congressional proposals to reorganize the nuclear weapons laboratories and programs after last year's espionage controversy. After Congress created an independent agency to manage the laboratories, Mr. Richardson resisted the plan, arguing that he should remain in charge, and that he could guarantee the safety of the nation's nuclear secrets.  Last week, in the wake of the latest security breach, the Senate confirmed a director of the new nuclear weapons agency, Gen. John Gordon, who had been deputy director of central intelligence.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Richardson's words promising to protect the nation's secrets were thrown back at him by the Republicans.</p>
        <p>''He chose to assume the full responsibility, to reject putting someone else in charge, to fight the creation of this new semiautonomous agency,'' Mr. Kyl said on ''Meet the Press.''</p>
        <p>''He was the one, by his own choice, who chose to accept'' responsibility, Mr. Kyl said, and ''therefore he has to bear the consequences, and I believe he ought to step down.''</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, assailed the Clinton administration for its handling of security, telling an audience in Florida that ''America's national security should not be a matter of lost and found.'' Mr. Bush added that the administration is to blame for ''confusion and chaos'' at Los Alamos.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson emphasized today that he had been working over the last year to tighten security, but suggested that his efforts had been impeded by a nonchalant attitude about security among scientists at the laboratory.</p>
        <p>''The problem is the human element,'' he said. ''I'm trying to change the security culture. I'm trying to deal with that human element, and I'm doing my best. But to say that security has not been upgraded at Los Alamos and at all our labs is wrong. We have done a good job in upgrading security, cybersecurity, physical security, polygraphs.''</p>
        <p>He added, on the ABC program ''This Week,'' that ''I have to keep a balance between science and security.</p>
        <p>''Security is a priority, but at the same time a lot of important scientific research has to take place, and you know, right now I don't seem to win,'' he said. ''I'm attacked by scientists that say 'too much security,' members of Congress that don't like polygraphs, civil libertarians that say I've gone too far. And now you get -- now, I can take the heat. I just want to fix this problem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson said investigators were focusing on members of the Nuclear Emergency Search Team and scientists who had access to the vault in the nuclear weapons design division of Los Alamos, where the hard drives were stored.</p>
        <p>He said it was possible that a scientist took the hard drives and ''panicked'' when their disappearance led to an investigation. The person may have then dropped them behind the copying machine in order to return them without being caught.</p>
        <p>The F.B.I., which is now conducting a criminal inquiry, has given polygraph tests to 26 people so far, focusing on scientists in the laboratory's X Division and NEST members. At least three people have flunked the tests, offering contradictory answers, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson said on ''This Week'' that the F.B.I. was ''focusing on a few individuals within that X Division.''</p>
        <p>''We do believe there is no evidence, according to the F.B.I. and our experts, of espionage or that they left the X Division,'' he said. ''But at the same time, this is not a victory speech. We have to get to the bottom of this.''</p>
        <p>The deputy energy secretary, T. J. Glauthier, appearing on ''Fox News Sunday,'' said investigators ''can't tell for sure'' at this time whether the hard drives had been copied or tampered with.</p>
