        <p>Players around the world are likely to reap considerable benefits from the two Worldwide Pairs games played early this month. Some national organizations, including the American Contract Bridge League, are studying the possibility of regularly using the brilliant software developed in England by Anna Gudge and Mark Newton. Players may soon be able to go home after a game at any level, from club duplicate to national championship, and download all the scores. They will even be able to see their own score card with the matchpoints earned on each deal. The Web site is: www.worldbridge.org</p>
        <p>The diagramed deal from the second game helped Elliot Sternlicht and Robert Kuhnreich finish 12th in the world and 3rd in the United States, playing at Honors Club in Manhattan. They were North and South, and there were competitive bidding problems for both partnerships.</p>
        <p>North was close to an opening bid, but his unguarded king was not worth its full value. He passed, and East had a choice. At other tables some opened one spade. This allowed some South players to venture a two-heart bid, uncovering the vital heart fit with little danger of suffering a serious penalty. Even if West held strong hearts, he would be unable to double for penalties.</p>
        <p>When East bid two spades, South was silenced. Three hearts would have been decidedly dangerous. Now it was up to West. If he had bid four spades, an action by North would have been risky: West could have had a strong defensive hand.</p>
        <p>But the three-spade raise, a mild pre-emptive action, made it possible for North to emerge with a take-out double. Both his opponents had shown limited high-card strength, so there was little risk. South was now happy to bid four hearts, and continue to the five-level when East continued to four spades.</p>
        <p>The fate of five hearts depended on the location of the heart king and the club queen. As both were lying favorably, South was able to finesse successfully in both suits and make an overtrick for an excellent matchpoint score: 4,967 of a possible 5,606.</p>
        <p>At tables at which East-West played in spades, nine tricks was the limit. So in theory the raise to three spades, made in the hope that North-South would be silenced, was right. In practice it was a disaster, for the opposition was able to enter the auction and make a vulnerable game.</p>
