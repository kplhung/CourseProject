        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A June 13 news article accurately  points out that the defense industry is -- regrettably, in my view -- not playing a perceptible role in promoting the need for antiballistic missile systems. At the same time, it implies that the industry is having a huge effect on the debate by virtue of its contributions to the Center for Security Policy, of which I am president.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A June 13 news article accurately  points out that the defense industry is -- regrettably, in my view -- not playing a perceptible role in promoting the need for antiballistic missile systems. At the same time, it implies that the industry is having a huge effect on the debate by virtue of its contributions to the Center for Security Policy, of which I am president.</p>
        <p>It is gratifying that you recognize our role on behalf of ending America's vulnerability to missile attack. While we welcome contributions from corporations and others who share our commitment to strong national security and the need for effective missile defenses, those contributions flow from the work we do -- not the other way around. For the record, since the center was founded in 1988, contributions from defense companies have averaged only 17 percent of annual receipts and in 1999 were 9.8 percent.</p>
        <p>FRANK J. GAFFNEY JR.  Washington, June 13, 2000</p>
