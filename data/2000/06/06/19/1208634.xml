      <abstract>
        <p>Letter from Oscar Arias, former president of Costa Rica and winner of Nobel Peace Prize in 1997, says funds earmarked for United States missile defense program could be more productively invested in anti-poverty programs and social services but advocates for the needy unfortunately lack clout of arms industry (June 13 article)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The fact that defense contractors have given generously to political campaigns in the past (news article, June 13) might account for the support that some United States officials are giving to a proposed $60 billion missile defense program.</p>
        <p>The gradual thawing of cold-war tensions in Korea and the trend toward reform in Iran point to the speciousness of the argument that the United States needs this system to protect itself against rogue states. Support for the missile defense initiative is all the more perplexing when you consider that a panel of independent scientists has concluded that the use of relatively simple decoys would allow missiles to penetrate the planned defenses.</p>
