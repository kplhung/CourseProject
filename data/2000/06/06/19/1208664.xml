        <p>One of the features most responsible for America Online's success has been the buddy list -- the small box on the computer screen showing a user which friends are logged on and available for an instant online conversation.</p>
        <p>Now the company is testing the power of buddyship even more. Today it will introduce AOLTV, the centerpiece of the company's AOL Anywhere strategy to move beyond the personal computer.</p>
        <p>AOLTV, like Microsoft's WebTV, is a black box enabling people to surf the Internet on their television screens. But with only a million subscribers after three years, Web TV has been a disappointment.</p>
        <p>So AOLTV, in contrast, is being marketed for its use to existing America Online members who want to keep access to their e-mail, chat rooms and buddy list while watching television.</p>
        <p>Push one button on the AOLTV wireless keyboard, and the same buddy-list window from the PC-based service will appear in translucent letters over the television image. One more click can start a chat with someone, whether they too are on AOLTV or on their computer, or soon on their AOL-enabled cell phone.</p>
        <p>Want new friends? Push a different button, and you're in a chat room with people watching the same show. The TV image, reduced, remains in a corner of the screen.</p>
        <p>America Online says that many people have computers in their family rooms so they can chat while watching television, and AOLTV will make this easier.</p>
        <p>But it is also gambling that prospective customers are willing to pay $249 for a set-top box, made by Philips, and connect it to the cable box and the video recorder, as well as to a phone line. Subscribers will also have to pay an additional $15 a month if they are already AOL members or $26 a month if they are not.</p>
        <p>''It's a bit of a stretch that chat and instant messaging will drive all these people to attach another box to their television set, said Josh Bernoff, an interactive-television analyst with Forrester Research. ''Fifteen dollars is a lot of money, plus it uses another phone line, and the value people are getting is relatively low.''</p>
        <p>Barry Schuler, the president of AOL's online service, is unapologetic about the price. ''AOL is a premium product,'' he said. ''We don't sell AOL on price.''</p>
        <p>Still, he expects it to catch on with consumers slowly, selling a few hundred thousand units in the first year. ''If you look at the history of consumer electronics, it takes 10 years for a new platform to become established,'' he said. ''If this category was started with WebTV, we're only two years in.''</p>
        <p>And he acknowledges that there are better ways to deliver this service than by putting another black box on top of the television set. AOL has already announced a deal to combine AOLTV with the TiVo video recorder and another to incorporate it into the set-top box used to decode the DirecTV satellite system.</p>
        <p>With America Online buying Time Warner, there are plans for a version built into that company's cable television boxes. Cable, but not satellite, offers the advantage of two-way communication, obviating the need for another phone line.</p>
        <p>(In the meantime, AOL will simply try to sell the existing Philips box through Time Warner's cable unit.)</p>
        <p>But Mr. Schuler says that even the current configuration will have a following nonetheless among families where several children have developed the habit of chatting online with their friends so much that fights erupt over access to the computer. For the more affluent of these households, he reckons, an additional phone line and the AOLTV service may be a better way to keep the peace than buying another computer.</p>
        <p>With the audience likely to be small for the foreseeable future, America Online has not sold any advertising yet, but it has built in lots of potential for commerce. There is a shopping channel. There is the ability for broadcast networks to add shopping content to their programs, splitting revenue with America Online. (Click to buy Oprah's book club selection, for example.) And ads are sprinkled through an elaborate, searchable on-screen program guide. America Online figures the biggest buyer will be TV networks trying to attract viewers.</p>
        <p>The company has also created ''channels'' on sports, weather and news that mix text information, advertising, and a small video window. It plans to auction off the rights to television networks to be the featured program. (Don't be surprised to see CNN on the news channel, and other Time Warner properties spread liberally through the service.)</p>
        <p>''We have the same model we have with AOL,'' Mr. Schuler said. ''You can create very valuable real estate by getting enough customers to come to a place. Then we can sell it.''</p>
