        <p>THE LIFE OF SCHUBERT  By Christopher H. Gibbs  Illustrated. 211 pages. Cambridge University Press. $44.95.</p>
        <p>Few long-dead classical musicians have lived a more exciting life over the last decade or so than Franz Schubert. And few composers have more desperately needed such an upheaval to shake off a lingering weight of pious myths a century and more in the making.</p>
        <p>The Schubert of popular image was a veritable icon of Biedermeier Vienna, a porcelain figurine waiting to happen. A short, squat, bespectacled figure nicknamed Schwammerl (Little Mushroom), he was shy, quaint and irresistibly charming to his many male friends and to high-born women alike. The pieties took on added urgency because of his tragic fate; he died in 1828, at 31, just as he was reaching his mature stride; yet he left behind a huge body of work. He simply exuded lovely melody, improvising songs and dances at convivial gatherings or dashing them off on restaurant napkins.</p>

        <p>THE LIFE OF SCHUBERT  By Christopher H. Gibbs  Illustrated. 211 pages. Cambridge University Press. $44.95.</p>
        <p>Few long-dead classical musicians have lived a more exciting life over the last decade or so than Franz Schubert. And few composers have more desperately needed such an upheaval to shake off a lingering weight of pious myths a century and more in the making.</p>
        <p>The Schubert of popular image was a veritable icon of Biedermeier Vienna, a porcelain figurine waiting to happen. A short, squat, bespectacled figure nicknamed Schwammerl (Little Mushroom), he was shy, quaint and irresistibly charming to his many male friends and to high-born women alike. The pieties took on added urgency because of his tragic fate; he died in 1828, at 31, just as he was reaching his mature stride; yet he left behind a huge body of work. He simply exuded lovely melody, improvising songs and dances at convivial gatherings or dashing them off on restaurant napkins.</p>
        <p>Well, to begin with, make that bar napkins, and then only if he could still see straight. For Schubert, it emerges even from sanitized accounts by his friends that have increasingly come to light, often drank to excess. What's more, he was versatile in his dissolution, given to sensual passions of sundry types. Like Brahms, he may well have consorted with prostitutes; the syphilis that set in six years before his death and cut him down prematurely had to start somewhere. His personality would probably be called depressive today.</p>
        <p>All this has come clear of late. And to make matters more interesting, the musical scholar Maynard Solomon has surmised, on the basis of some of the scant surviving documents in the composer's hand, that Schubert was gay. Since this theory gained wide circulation in 1989, Schubert's sexuality has become one of the hottest topics in Western musicology.</p>
        <p>Christopher H. Gibbs's slim volume, ''The Life of Schubert,'' in Cambridge University Press's series Musical Lives, is therefore timely and valuable. Though terse, it brings all those matters up to date in an eminently readable manner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibbs, who teaches music at the State University at Buffalo, edited ''The Cambridge Companion to Schubert'' of 1997. He also took part in the later stages of the decadelong Schubertiade at the 92nd Street Y, which ended in 1997. Although he relies heavily on secondary sources here, he has also done original research, and he proposes a neat little theory of his own: a secret program for Schubert's E flat Piano Trio.</p>
        <p>That work was begun some six months after Beethoven died, and given its premiere on the first anniversary of his death on March 26, 1828 (eight months, it turned out, before Schubert's own passing). Mr. Gibbs finds similarities in the trio, with its movement resembling a funeral march, to Beethoven: especially to the ''Eroica'' Symphony, written in the same key ''in memory of a great man.'' Although it was obvious to few others at the time that Schubert, still little known outside Vienna or in grand musical forms, was a logical candidate to take up Beethoven's mantle, from this and other evidence it was apparent to Schubert, Mr. Gibbs plausibly suggests, as it has been to posterity. ''While previous commentators have called Schubert's movement a funeral march, and a few have noticed the tonal, melodic and structural similarities to Beethoven's symphony,'' Mr. Gibbs writes of his interpretation, ''the greater meaning has remained secret.''</p>
        <p>But in so concise a tome, something has to give, and Mr. Gibbs hastens to point out that the book is not everything it might appear. ''This book concerns less 'The Life of Schubert' than 'The Life of Schubert's Career,' a story more of the artist than the man,'' he writes. ''In certain respects this book aims to be an 'antibiography.' I shall emphasize the distortion and trivialization of his life that formed and informed popular images.''</p>
        <p>At the same time Mr. Gibbs is no iconoclast or sensationalist. ''We are currently at a point where some unproven claims about the darker Schubert threaten to become a new orthodoxy in the absence of sufficient historical investigation or evidence,'' he writes judiciously. He spreads his skepticism evenly on new evidence and theories as well as old.</p>
        <p>''Schubert remains in the shadows,'' he notes, ''even as some try figuratively to bring him out of the closet and the pub and into the psychiatrist's consulting room.''</p>
        <p>The approach is loosely chronological. But Mr. Gibbs begins by examining three artistic representations of Schubertian soirees to set the scene. And one biographical chapter is constructed around themes raised in an 1824 letter from Schubert to his friend Leopold Kupelwieser. ''In a word, I feel myself the most unhappy and wretched creature in the world,'' the diseased composer writes. ''Imagine a man whose health will never be right again, and who in sheer despair over this ever makes things worse and worse instead of better.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibbs's emphases, though sometimes repetitious, are often fascinating. He notes, for example, that for the composer, most of his output was prelude. In 1827 Schubert acknowledged, among other works, ''three operas, a Mass and a symphony.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibbs elaborates: ''At first the comment seems curious: Schubert had written some eight operas, five Masses, seven (and a half) symphonies and so much else; yet he willingly acknowledged only fully mature pieces.''</p>
        <p>The musical discussion is nontechnical. Although many works are located in the unfolding of Schubert's career, few are discussed in detail. Still, what comment there is is cogent, as when Mr. Gibbs cites Schubert's ''uncanny ability to make the major mode sound despairing.'' Can any listener fail to be relieved, for example, when, in ''Gute Nacht,'' the opening song of the cycle ''Winterreise,'' the music slumps back into D minor after the painfully illusory hope raised by the excursion into D major?</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibbs spends perhaps too much time trying to tie the mood of a specific work to the mood of the composer when writing it. Yes such correspondences can sometimes emerge, the more so with such new evidence as Mr. Gibbs supplies. Still, the creative process is at bottom mysterious, and those one-to-one alignments inevitably break down sooner rather than later. It is also surprising to see so redoubtable a Schubertian refer to the composer's ''great C major'' Symphony (No. 9, that is, in mere contradistinction to the ''little C major,'' No. 6) loosely as the ''Great'' Symphony.</p>
        <p>No matter. Mr. Gibbs, with his solid grounding and balanced view, packs a great deal into a small space and supplies a corrective still sorely needed: or, as he suggests, needed now more than ever, as seductive new theories mingle freely with comfortable old myths.</p>
