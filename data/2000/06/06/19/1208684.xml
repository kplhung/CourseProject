        <p>Frederick Noyes, a versatile New York architect who worked on design projects that included Lever House and a Park Avenue luggage store, died on June 10 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 87 and lived on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>Mr. Noyes, known as Fred, was with the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill in Manhattan in the late 1940's and early 1950's. His work there included helping design Lever House, the first glass skyscraper on Park Avenue, under the architect Gordon Bunshaft.</p>
        <p>Mr. Noyes opened his own office in Manhattan in 1954 and retired in 1982. His 1980 design of the T. Anthony Ltd. luggage store at 480 Park Avenue won this praise from The New Yorker magazine: ''The architect Fred Noyes has designed a shop where the stock recovers its gaiety and comes into its own again.''</p>
        <p>He was born and reared in Colebrook, N.H., and received a bachelor's degree in architecture in 1936 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He served in the Army during World War II.</p>
        <p>His marriage to Marjorie Kister ended in divorce.</p>
        <p>He is survived by a brother, Irving, of Jefferson City, Tenn.; a half-brother, Bernerd Burbank of Bronxville, N.Y.; three sons, Jonathan, of Woodland, Calif., David, of Huntington, N.Y., and Peter, of East Hampton, N.Y.; and four grandchildren.</p>
