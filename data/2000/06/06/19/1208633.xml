        <p>Re ''Warming's Effects to Be Widespread'' (front page, June 12): I am concerned about how oblivious our petroleum-dependent society is to the effect that our everyday activities have on the earth.</p>
        <p>People are complaining because the limited resource that we pump into our inefficient automobiles and other machines is becoming more expensive as it disappears. Headlines describing ''ridiculous'' gas prices seem to penetrate our minds, but an article describing the effects that our comfortable lifestyles will have on the way we are forced to live in a few decades is not fully understood because of our cultured ignorance.</p>
        <p>We need to instill an understanding in the mind of every ''gasoholic'' in our society that we cannot depend on petroleum forever. Each time we start our engines, a new consciousness should pervade and create shame for the manner in which we are polluting our world.</p>
