        <p>Four days after reconciliation talks, North Korea today accused the United States, which has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea, of increasing the danger of war on the Korean peninsula.</p>
        <p>''The United States imperialists pretend to be interested in peace and detente on the Korean peninsula, but their actions only result in increasing the danger of war and escalating tensions,'' said the Rodong Shinmun, the leading newspaper of the North Korean Workers Party.</p>
        <p>The accusation, which was carried by the North's overseas news outlet, the Korean Central News Agency, came just two days after the United States said it had no plans to withdraw American troops from South Korea, despite a landmark agreement between the two Koreas to pursue peace and reunification.</p>
        <p>North Korea has long demanded the removal of United States troops based in the South, arguing that the Americans were preparing to go to war. Coming on the heels of the meeting last week, today's denunciation seemed intended to thrust the United States firmly into the middle of the Korean peace effort -- a position that Washington has sought to avoid, encouraging the Koreas to negotiate their own peace.</p>
        <p>Now that North and South are inching closer together, the United States appears unwilling to give up its presence on the peninsula, a development North Korea may exploit.</p>
        <p>Today's pointed statement from North Korea did not specify how the United States was increasing tensions. But the Communist country objects both to the strong American presence here and to American plans for a missile defense shield that Washington says is primarily intended to guard against attack from North Korea.</p>
        <p>American intelligence and military officials say that North Korea is developing long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. North Korea is concerned, regional analysts say, that the United States will share its missile defense system with Washington's allies in Asia.</p>
        <p>Park Young Ho, director of the Center for North Korean Society and Human Rights, a government-funded research institute, said that ''North Korea plans to use the issue of the troops and the theater missile defense as a bargaining chip, which has the potential to derail the entire process'' of reconciliation between the two Koreas.</p>
        <p>''In the aftermath of the Korean summit, North Korea is hardening its position through peace,'' Mr. Park said. ''It wants more positive security assurances from the United States.''</p>
        <p>American officials have welcomed the summit meeting as a positive step toward easing tensions and expressed support for further talks, but they have ruled out discussion of withdrawing American troops as premature.</p>
        <p>''Any discussion of troop strengths or any number of other issues will have to be addressed as the process moves forward,'' a spokesman for the National Security Council, Lt. Col. David B. Stockwell, said today.</p>
        <p>Appearing on CNN on Saturday, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said it was time to reconsider the deployment in South Korea.</p>
        <p>''And after deliberation, we can determine whether it's time to bring them out,'' he said. ''It's too early for anybody to say we ought to bring them out now.''</p>
        <p>South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, signed a broad pact last week calling for ending decades-long aggression on the peninsula, reuniting of families separated by war and forging economic and other ties.</p>
        <p>On his return to Seoul, the South Korean president declared that the danger of war on the peninsula had disappeared. But tensions remain high along the demilitarized zone, the heavily fortified buffer that divides North and South. North Korea has close to one million troops situated in the DMZ, while South Korea has stationed half a million soldiers there, backed by the 37,000 American troops.</p>
        <p>South Korean military officials have long argued that their troops alone cannot deter an invasion by North Korea. They also depend on the United States for military intelligence. A recent South Korean military report concluded that North Korea had stockpiled between 2,500 and 5,000 tons of biological and chemical weapons.</p>
        <p>Aides to the South Korean president said that during the Pyongyang talks Mr. Kim had explained to his North Korean counterpart exactly why a continued American military presence was necessary for regional security. The officials declined to describe the response.</p>
        <p>The United States spends about $3 billion a year to maintain its troops in South Korea. To help shoulder the burden, Seoul pays Washington about $315 million a year in cash, and provides $1.3 billion in tax breaks, free use of land and other benefits.</p>
        <p>Public opinion polls taken since the summit meeting indicate that most South Koreans believe that war is now highly unlikely and that reunification will take place within 5 to 10 years.</p>
        <p>Even before the summit meeting, there were growing voices of opposition to American military bases in South Korea. On Saturday, hundreds of people demanding a withdrawal of United States troops clashed with the riot police near an American Air Force bombing range about 50 miles southwest of Seoul. The anti-American protests have increased since early March, when a United States fighter jet with engine trouble dropped six bombs on the range. United States and South Korean investigators said the bombs had caused no injuries, but local villagers said six people had been hurt.</p>
