        <p>The Florida Department of Health in Tallahassee, Fla., retained Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky in Miami, as the agency of record for its antitobacco campaign. Billings were estimated at $19 million for the 18-month contract.

        <p>Southeast Toyota Distributors, owned and operated by JM Family Enterprises, began a review for its consolidated account, with spending estimated at $70 million.</p>
        <p>Ed Sheehy, vice president for marketing at Southeast Toyota in Deerfield Beach, Fla., said the account was being consolidated to find a more efficient way to handle advertising for its 27 dealer associations. The four incumbents, who have all been invited to participate in the review, are: the Moran Group in Baton Rouge, La.; McGee &amp; Starr Advertising in Boca Raton, Fla.; Omni Automotive in Birmingham, Ala., part of the Intermark Group; and the Ft. Lauderdale office of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.</p>
