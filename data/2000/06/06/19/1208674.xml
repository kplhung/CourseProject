        <p>Lorraine Lacaillade, a 75-year-old widow in Bolton, about 25 miles southeast of here, lives on about $12,000 a year, most of it from Social Security. She takes prescription drugs for arthritis and other conditions that would cost more than $1,000 a year if she had to pay for them herself.</p>
        <p>But this is Vermont, a state in the vanguard of offering health benefits to its residents. Under the Vermont Health Access Plan, a program for people who are earning just enough to make ends meet, Mrs. Lacaillade only pays $3 a month for her medicine.</p>
        <p>''Medicine is awfully expensive today,'' she said. ''The old people need some help.''</p>
        <p>That is the prevailing philosophy here, embraced by the Democratic governor, state legislators from both parties, doctors and, clearly, the public.</p>
        <p>The array of health benefits that Vermont provides its residents -- not just the elderly but also children and low-income adults -- is unmatched by any other state.</p>
        <p>And while many of Vermont's programs would not work in larger and more urban states, other aspects could serve as models. Today, 93.5 percent of all Vermont residents have health insurance, including essentially all children. By contrast, only 63 percent of low-income children in Texas and 60 percent in Arizona are insured.</p>
        <p>''It is my view that health insurance ought to be universal, the right of every citizen in Vermont,'' Gov. Howard Dean said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Under a program called Dr. Dynasaur (some marketing wizard thought up the odd spelling), the state has guaranteed free medical and dental care to every resident age 18 and younger from a family with income below about $50,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Adults with income below 150 percent of the federal poverty line are entitled to medical coverage for a nominal fee. The poverty line, for instance, is $8,350 this year for a single person and $17,050 for a family of four. That means a single adult earning less than $12,500 is eligible, as is a family of four with less than $25,500.</p>
        <p>In addition, health insurance companies are required to sell policies to residents who request one, and must provide them at the same cost to all customers, regardless of their age or medical history.</p>
        <p>Here is what this can mean for a family: Gary and Sheila Clayton live in Burlington, barely making ends meet. He is a glazier for a company that does commercial and residential glass work. She works part time as a clerk in a doctor's office. They have three children, 12, 10 and 5. If they took family health insurance through Mr. Clayton's employer, it would cost $89 a week.</p>
        <p>But the Clayton children are covered by the Dr. Dynasaur program. And under the Vermont program for families with incomes only slightly above the poverty line, Mr. and Mrs. Clayton pay only $40 every six months for their own coverage.</p>
        <p>When Bradley, the 5-year-old, was born, he spent a week in the hospital in the neonatal care unit. The hospital bill was almost $10,000; Dr. Dynasaur paid all of it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dean, a Democrat, and his wife, Judy Steinberg, are physicians, and the generous health benefits are largely his doing.</p>
        <p>He took office in 1991 determined to pass legislation that in one fell swoop would provide health coverage to everyone in Vermont. His bill was similar to the one offered by the Clinton administration in 1993, and it was defeated in the State Legislature in 1994, just months before the Clinton plan died in Congress.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Dean began implementing the plan gradually -- extending coverage to low-income adults one year, providing drug coverage to the elderly another, expanding coverage for children another. This year, 28,600 elderly and disabled Vermont residents, about one-third of those on Medicare, are receiving drug coverage under the state program. The Dr. Dynasaur program covers 55,000 of the state's 145,000 children.</p>
        <p>''I now realize that the only way you can do this is incrementally,'' he said. ''You do it piece by piece and bit by bit because you can't take on every special interest all at once.''</p>
        <p>Part of the cost of the expanded benefits is picked up by Washington under the Medicaid program. But the state's share is considerable, which is why other states have not adopted similar measures.</p>
        <p>With advances in health benefits paralyzed in Washington because of partisan warfare, Mr. Dean has accomplished his goals with little Republican opposition.</p>
        <p>''Health care is not a partisan issue in Vermont,'' said John H. Bloomer Jr., a Republican leader in the State Senate. ''Generally speaking, it's a bipartisan goal to expand health care access and affordability.''</p>
        <p>Vermont is hardly typical. It is a rural state with a population of about 591,000, less than Milwaukee's. Ninety-eight percent of the residents are white, and there are almost no new immigrants. The poverty rate is somewhat below the national average, but so are wages and per capita income.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dean conceded that if Vermont were less remote, his program of requiring insurance companies to offer health insurance at the same rates to everyone would not work. People with serious, chronic illnesses would move in just for the insurance, he said.</p>
        <p>But larger states could learn from parts of the Vermont experience.</p>
        <p>Not too long ago, for instance, Vermont had a serious problem with teenage pregnancy. Now, it has the lowest rate of adolescent pregnancy in the nation. The governor credits the Dr. Dynasaur program for the decline.</p>
        <p>Dr. Joseph F. Hagan Jr., a pediatrician in Burlington, was not willing to give all the credit to the program, but he said it certainly made a difference.</p>
        <p>For one thing, Dr. Hagan said, teenage girls go to the doctor more often now than they did when they had to pay for it, and they are getting counseling and sex education. For another, the program pays for birth control pills and other contraceptives. Girls can get them without their parents having to pay the bill -- in fact, without their parents even knowing.</p>
        <p>People who work with the elderly said they could also see the difference since the state's health programs became more extensive.</p>
        <p>''If they didn't have the insurance, they wouldn't take their medicine,'' said John Barbour, executive director of the Champlain Valley Agency on Aging.</p>
        <p>The situation is not without drawbacks. Take the case of the Cookson family in Huntington, a small community east of here. Owen Cookson is a construction foreman who made  good money with overtime in the summer and little in the winter. Marie Cookson works out of their small A-frame house preparing income tax returns. They have three children. Mr. Cookson has $50 a week withheld from his paycheck for employer-provided health insurance that starts after a $4,000 annual family deductible has been met.</p>
        <p>Their son, Nathan, 12, had to go to the emergency room recently with an inflammation. That bill was $400, and the family faces hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in bills for additional tests.</p>
        <p>If this had happened in the winter, the bills would have been paid by Dr. Dynasaur, which covers deductibles and copayments for families with private insurance. But eligibility is calculated monthly, and Mr. Cookson earned enough in May, one of the months when construction work is plentiful, to push the family's monthly income above the cutoff.</p>
        <p>''This is going to be a lot of money we're paying out,'' Mrs. Cookson said. ''And we can hardly afford it.''</p>
        <p>Some doctors are also concerned. Dr. Thomas A. E. Moseley, a pediatrician at a rural health clinic in Newport, near the Canadian border, said he had seen a huge difference because of Dr. Dynasaur in the number of children receiving preventive care.</p>
        <p>''This is the Holy Grail of pediatrics,'' Dr. Moseley said. But 75 percent of his practice involves Dr. Dynasaur patients. He is paid at the Medicaid rate, which is often not enough to cover his costs, he said.</p>
        <p>''It's a mixed blessing,'' Dr. Moseley said. ''The problem is far from being solved.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dean is also worried. The costs of the health benefits are rising. Drug costs alone are rising at a rate of 18 percent a year. The state has a budget surplus now. But if the economy turns sour, he says, he may have to ask the more affluent families on the Dr. Dynasaur program to make copayments.</p>
        <p>Meantime, he said, he hoped to install a program that would allow everyone in the state with income below 300 percent of the poverty level to get prescription drugs at the same lower rate paid by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor.</p>
        <p>He calls it another incremental step.</p>
