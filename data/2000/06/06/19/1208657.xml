This year Paris will be the scene of PeripheRock, billed as the most ambitious festival event yet. From 8 p.m. till dawn, the peripherique, the more than 20-mile ring road that circles the capital, will be transformed. Setting off from the 10 gates of Paris, dozens of music floats will guide crowds toward concert sites in Paris and the suburbs to listen, dance and fraternize to performances of rock, rap, groove and techno. Information: 011 33-1-44-94-98-00.</p>

        <p>On the Horizon  He loved ''Moby-Dick,'' Norse sagas and journals of 19th-century exploration. He was passionate about remote areas off the Maine and Alaskan coasts, about Newfoundland, Tierra del Fuego and Greenland. Rockwell Kent, who illustrated classic novels like ''Moby-Dick,'' was admired in his lifetime for his paintings of dramatic, isolated landscapes. Beginning on Saturday, more than 90 of Kent's paintings, prints and drawings, inspired by his wilderness experiences and assembled from around the world, will be exhibited through Oct. 29 in ''Distant Shores: The Odyssey of Rockwell Kent'' at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass. Information: (413) 298-4100, extension 220.</p>
        <p>Poet's Corner  The Nobel Prize-winning Irish poet William Butler Yeats will be celebrated in prose, poetry, song and music in the annual tribute of the W. B. Yeats Society of New York at 7:30 tonight at Frederick Loewe Theater of New York University at 35 West Fourth Street in Greenwich Village. Rare home movies will be shown; the actress Celeste Holm will read her favorite Yeats poem, ''The Three Bushes''; Irish music will be played; and there will be a re-creation of a 1925 Irish Senate debate in which Yeats delivered a famous speech against a ban on divorce. Information: (212) 780-0605.</p>
