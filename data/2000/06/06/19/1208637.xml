        <p>For 55 years, Guideposts magazine, which was founded by Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, the author of ''The Power of Positive Thinking,'' has been spinning out stories filled with hope and inspiration.</p>
        <p>And for 55 years, the monthly spiritual magazine has refused to run any form of advertising. But that is about to change.</p>
        <p>Faced with the same problems that are affecting the rest of the subscription-only magazine industry and hoping to cash in on Americans' fascination with spirituality, Guideposts has decided to start accepting advertising in January, albeit from ''wholesome'' sources.</p>
        <p>The decision represents a marked change for the New York-based magazine, which started as a war-time leaflet of real-life inspirational stories. The basic formula for the magazine, which now has a circulation of 2.6 million, remains the same.</p>
        <p>A typical story features a young man who becomes estranged from his family, takes a job as an industrial deep-sea diver, is in a life-threatening accident and then realizes that family is the most important thing in his life. Another fairly representative story is about a woman who donates bone marrow, becomes friends with the recipient and discovers several years later that her friend needs a kidney.</p>
        <p>The ending? ''This is Guideposts,'' said Edward Grinnan, the editor in chief. ''She made the right decision and donated her kidney.''</p>
        <p>These are stories, according to the publisher, Janine Scolpino, ''about the triumph of the human spirit.''</p>
        <p>Until recently the magazine depended on subscriptions for revenue. But circulation has dropped 10 percent the last five years, in part because of a 40 percent price increase in that period, Ms. Scolpino said.</p>
        <p>She said the magazine had also faced higher operating expenses like the rising price of paper and had been hurt by the legal troubles plaguing the sweepstakes companies, which used to provide it with a significant source of new subscribers.</p>
        <p>By adding advertisements, Guideposts risks alienating some of the most devoted readers in the industry. The nondenominational magazine has an unusually high 70 percent renewal rate.</p>
        <p>The magazine plans a five-year aggressive growth strategy, officials said. It has hired Roger Black's publication design consulting firm, the company responsible for the flashy makeovers at Newsweek and Smart Money, to revamp the magazine.</p>
        <p>Ms. Scolpino said she was worried that Dr. Peale, who died in 1993 at the age of 95, might not have approved of the decision to take advertising. Her doubts soon dissipated, however. After the decision, she said, ''We broke for lunch and I said to Dr. Peale's wife, 'How would Norman have felt about today?' She said he would have loved it.''</p>
