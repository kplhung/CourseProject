        <p>Can someone please explain how the British can get so worked up about genetically altered food yet be perfectly at home with genetically altered comedy? Because ''The League of Gentlemen,'' the series from the BBC that makes its American debut tonight on Comedy Central, is nothing if not genetically altered. It is comedy far more outlandish, far more deranged than nature ever intended comedy to be.</p>
        <p>''The League of Gentlemen,'' which first appeared on the BBC in 1999, is an amalgam of sketches, sight gags, running jokes and plot lines that almost defies description. Attempting it is like trying to convey to someone living in two dimensions what three-dimensional existence feels like. Two dimensions in this case is ''Frasier,'' ''Friends'' and every other mainstream American comedy. Remove the taste barriers and the strictures of the sitcom format -- the tidy half-hour plots, the setup-zinger-laugh writing -- and you're in the realm of ''The League of Gentlemen.''</p>

        <p>Can someone please explain how the British can get so worked up about genetically altered food yet be perfectly at home with genetically altered comedy? Because ''The League of Gentlemen,'' the series from the BBC that makes its American debut tonight on Comedy Central, is nothing if not genetically altered. It is comedy far more outlandish, far more deranged than nature ever intended comedy to be.</p>
        <p>''The League of Gentlemen,'' which first appeared on the BBC in 1999, is an amalgam of sketches, sight gags, running jokes and plot lines that almost defies description. Attempting it is like trying to convey to someone living in two dimensions what three-dimensional existence feels like. Two dimensions in this case is ''Frasier,'' ''Friends'' and every other mainstream American comedy. Remove the taste barriers and the strictures of the sitcom format -- the tidy half-hour plots, the setup-zinger-laugh writing -- and you're in the realm of ''The League of Gentlemen.''</p>
        <p>This, of course, puts you in very strange, often offensive territory. More specifically, it puts you in Royston Vasey, a fictional town in northern England where pets die strange deaths and humans who make the mistake of entering a certain local shop are rarely seen again. Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson created the show, and the first three men play dozens of characters in it, often in dresses.</p>
        <p>It's a sort of mock-horror soap opera, and, like a soap opera, it may be difficult for viewers who miss the first episode to figure out what's going on. Not that there is anything so normal as a continuous plot; sometimes the sketches and scenes are related to one another, sometimes they're not. The problem for the late-arriving viewer will be more in the nature of getting a bead on the assorted wackos. Someone tuning in ''Seinfeld'' for the first time might pigeonhole George, Jerry, Elaine and Kramer with rough accuracy after about 15 minutes. But in Royston Vasey there are scores of characters, and all of them make Kramer look downright normal.</p>
        <p>Plenty of American viewers won't get any of this. And plenty will find it in very bad taste. There is bathroom humor, animal abuse humor, humor at the expense of the homeless and the mentally impaired. And those bothered by the sight of a woman (played by a man) nursing a pig -- yes, that's right; nursing a pig -- need not apply.</p>
        <p>''The strangers you would bring would not understand us, our customs, our local ways,'' the woman's husband tells two unfortunate highway construction workers during this scene.</p>
        <p>''Boy, I'll say,'' a segment of America will respond.</p>
        <p>Yet ''The League of Gentlemen'' is not frat house humor, or even ''South Park.'' The show is regularly compared to Monty Python, and it has a Pythonesque intelligence running through it, even if the vulgarity does sometimes get out of control.</p>
        <p>In any case, once the shock of the material has worn off, in the end, what impresses about ''The League of Gentlemen'' is that the characters -- more than 60 of them, the publicity packet claims -- are distinct, vivid, each crazy or appalling in his or her own way. The contrast with the American prime-time sitcom, with its interchangeable collection of self-absorbed teenagers and young professionals, is dismaying.</p>
        <p>Even if much of what goes on in Royston Vasey would never make network television, there's a lesson here for America's moribund sitcom universe. Not all humor emanates from Cosby-type families; not all casts must be six characters or fewer; not all comedic scripts have to be written in two concurrent plot lines that intersect and resolve at the end of the half-hour. There is, as Rod Serling taught us, another dimension.</p>
        <p>THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN  Comedy Central, tonight at 10:30</p>
        <p>Written by Jeremy Dyson, Mark Gattis, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith; performed by Mr. Gattis, Mr. Pemberton and Mr. Shearsmith; produced by Sarah Smith and Jemma Rodgers; directed by Steve Bendelack; Jon Plowman, executive producer. Produced by BBC Worldwide.</p>
        <p>TELEVISION REVIEW  Correction:  June 22, 2000, Thursday  A television review on Monday about ''The League of Gentlemen,'' a comedy series, misstated the time of its American premiere. The premiere was on Aug. 14, 1999, on BBC America, a channel available in New York City through satellite service and on some cable systems nationwide, not Monday night on the cable channel Comedy Central.</p>
        <p>A correction in some copies in this space yesterday about the same error in the Television section on Sunday rendered the last word of the show's title incorrectly. It is ''The League of Gentlemen,'' not ''Gentleman.''</p>
