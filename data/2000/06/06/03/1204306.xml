        <p>Of all the cruelties of apartheid, the most malicious may have been the deliberate denial of educational opportunity to blacks. Their segregated schools taught ''Bantu education,'' by design equipping them only for menial jobs; and the government excluded all but a few from the country's great universities.</p>
        <p>So it was a powerful symbol of change for me to watch a graduation ceremony the other day at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. It was for students of engineering, regional planning and development, among others; and most of the graduates were black.</p>
        <p>Like so many things in South Africa, the education story is mixed. Many state schools, especially in rural areas, are desperately under-equipped. Teachers are badly paid. But the state schools in the formerly all-white suburbs, which now have large numbers of black students, are maintaining standards -- and well-off white families are mostly not moving their children to private schools.</p>
        <p>The crucial thing to understand about South Africa is that it has embarked on the second of two immense transitions. The first was political: the change from rule by the white minority to constitutional democracy. The second is economic and social: giving more South Africans an appropriate share of the country's great wealth.</p>
        <p>The political change went astonishingly well. Prophets of doom were confounded. The new political and legal system is working.</p>
        <p>The economic and social challenge is just as daunting. Income distribution is grotesquely unequal. Apartheid's effects linger in a vast class without adequate education. Unemployment is severe. Crime is a serious problem, made to look worse by journalism's focus on horror stories.</p>
        <p>But as any visitor can see, the fact is that South Africa is functioning as a sophisticated modern society. During my visit there were headlines about plans of the environment minister, Valli Moosa, to ban four-wheel-drive vehicles from beaches and outlaw the thin plastic bags that litter the countryside.</p>
        <p>A skeptical British columnist, Simon Jenkins of The Times, visited a few months ago and wrote: ''Six years ago I would have predicted that, by now, Nelson Mandela's successor would preside over ailing business confidence, a sliding property market and a flight of money. I would have been totally wrong. . . . President Thabo Mbeki has tamed inflation and has a sustained private-sector boom.''</p>
        <p>International credit-rating firms recently gave South Africa an investment-grade rating. A bond issue was oversubscribed, by, among others, American pension funds. The Financial Times of London commented: ''Not so long ago, bankers were more familiar with Johannesburg's crime statistics than with South Africa's economy. The enthusiastic response to Pretoria's bond issue shows how much things have changed.''</p>
        <p>The financial progress is impressive. But it leaves unanswered the question of how to uplift the have-nots: the unemployed and the rural poor who are not in the formal economy at all.</p>
        <p>A widespread corporate effort to bring blacks into administrative jobs, backed by a national commitment to affirmative action, is enlarging the black middle class quite rapidly. The danger, though, is that a black elite will still leave the mass of the population underemployed, poor -- and increasingly resentful.</p>
        <p>The challenge requires two further steps, I think. One is faster economic growth to create jobs. That necessarily means more foreign investment.</p>
        <p>The other answer is more government action, for example to give land to landless black farm workers and restore land to black communities from which it was seized. The Ministry of Land is supposed to be doing this but has so far not even spent the money it has in its budget.</p>
        <p>Uplifting the deprived sectors of society no doubt requires some sacrifice by whites of their economic position, which remains extraordinarily privileged. Many resist the idea. There is still little awareness that greater equality is essential to stability.</p>
        <p>Whatever the problems, one must not forget what a difference the end of apartheid and its repressive laws has made. A schoolteacher in the town of Germiston, Joseph Tumahole, noted the difficulties of his job. But he said: ''I am free now to say what I want to say. I am free to go where I want to go. I am free to see who I want to see.''</p>
