        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I have to disagree with criticism of capri pants (''Aisles of Capris,'' Op-Ed, May 31). They have set us free down here in South Florida. They fill in that gap between pants and shorts.</p>
        <p>So many of us middle-aged moms hate wearing shorts. Wearing capris is sort of like cheating when full-length pants are too uncomfortable in the heat.</p>

        <p>I agree that there are some figures they do not belong on. But as a petite woman, I find them a dream come true.</p>
        <p>They don't need to be hemmed!</p>
        <p>One of my favorite family photos is of my Mom in her capris and funky sunglasses from the early 60's. I couldn't wait for them to be back in style.</p>
