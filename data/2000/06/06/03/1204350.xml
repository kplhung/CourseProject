        <p>Lee McTeigue can see them coming already.</p>
        <p>A real estate broker in the Westchester suburbs, Mrs. McTeigue will arrive at the commuter station Saturday morning to pick up her weekly batch of Manhattanites come to find their suburban castles.</p>
        <p>''They'll all have seen them,'' she said, sounding slightly ominous despite the sunshine beaming over the outdoor cafe where she was enjoying her Friday lunch. ''They'll all have their newspapers under their arm. They'll get in the car, open it up, point to it and say, 'I only want to look in this neighborhood.' ''</p>
        <p>She referred, as anyone in the suburbs might explain, to the scores on the New York State reading and writing tests, which were listed by school and district in newspapers statewide this morning. For suburban parents -- and would-be suburban parents --  these are not simply scores. They are the beacons that come to represent the entire worth of a community.</p>
        <p>Many people insist that they realize, as superintendents caution, that one test cannot possibly measure the full worth of a school. Still, these same parents found themselves sitting in cafes and diners across Westchester and Long Island anxiously comparing the scores at their school with the ones at the school across town or one suburb over. Other parents went online as soon as the state posted the scores to see how the Joneses' school was doing, while still others found themselves waiting by mailboxes for the scores to arrive.</p>
        <p>''People are very competitive,'' said Susan Sutin, who has children in the Mamaroneck school system, which includes the village of Larchmont. ''Everyone thinks their child is the best and the brightest. They want their child and their child's school to be on top.''</p>
        <p>In a Huntington shopping district on Long Island, Lorna Smith, the mother of a fourth grader, said she had been disappointed in comparing the town's schools with others in surrounding communities. Huntington's students had improved by 12 percentage points, with 65 percent passing the test. For a brief moment, she conceded, she even wished that she lived in one of those other towns.</p>
        <p>A New Rochelle parent, Karen Sadok, exulted over her city's scores, easily rattling off how well the students had done. ''We're thrilled to death,'' she said. ''They went up 16 points, from 54 percent to 70 percent.''</p>
        <p>Last year, the scores set off horror and fury in some suburban schools as scores came in far lower than expected. Several superintendents and principals held meetings where they found themselves trying to reason with angry parents -- often to little avail -- that the tests were still in the trial phase, that the scores were a baseline, not a judgment.</p>
        <p>It is not as if these schools did poorly; the anger came in districts where more than 80 percent of students passed. But here, the issue is not whether schools pass, it is how well they do, and how much better they do than other schools.</p>
        <p>''I went to lots of dinner parties last year where parents from Chatsworth and Murray were irate,'' said Kathy Dunn, a New Rochelle parent, referring to Larchmont's two most affluent elementary schools. ''People were demanding to know why they were paying such high taxes when their kids are getting only average scores.''</p>
        <p>This year, the anger had subsided, largely because suburban districts fared significantly better. In Westchester, the passing rate rose to 73.1 percent this year from 61 percent in 1999. In Nassau County, the percentage of students passing went to 77 percent from 65 percent, and in Suffolk County, 71 percent of fourth graders passed, compared with 58 percent last year.</p>
        <p>But that did not quash some of the quiet ''My school did better than your school'' comparisons -- or the ''Why didn't my school do as well as yours?'' -- among parents today.</p>
        <p>Vicki Osborne-Smittle, waiting for her child at Greenville School in Edgemont, grabbed the newspaper from the person standing next to her to see how that school had done.</p>
        <p>Around her, other mothers noted with some consternation that their school had not performed as well as Edgemont's other elementary school, Seely Place. At Greenville, 86 percent had passed, up from 71 percent last year; still, at Seely, 98 percent passed, compared with 83 percent last year.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Osborne-Smittle, a parent teacher association member, defended Greenville. ''The percentage increase for both schools went up the same amount,'' she noted. ''They're both fabulous. The curriculums are slightly different at both schools. Look, you have different kids each year, at different levels -- every year the kids change and the test results change. Next year the grades will be different. They're both a great community.''</p>
        <p>Debbie Jackson, a mother of a first and a fifth grader at Greenville, acknowledged that the comparisons were somewhat silly. ''By the time people get to the high school, you can't tell which kids went to Seely Place or Greenville.'' Still, she said, ''There's always a competition.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Dunn, the New Rochelle parent, said some neighbors had raised an eyebrow when she chose the Columbus Elementary School, a magnet school, for her son -- one with lower scores than the neighborhood school.</p>
        <p>''We're savvy parents; we recognize that there's more than a test score to a school,'' she said, adding that she liked Columbus's nurturing environment. ''We know the faculty, we know the families, I know what happens at that school on a daily basis.''</p>
        <p>Still, she checked to see how Scarsdale and Chappaqua had done. ''I'm curious,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As much as they gave in to the game, many parents said today that they were annoyed by the constant comparisons, the obsessiveness over a higher score.</p>
        <p>''It's people who don't understand education, who make a lot of money and feel very entitled,'' said Susan Cohen, a psychologist and parent with a child in the Mamaroneck schools. ''And they think because they have a lot of money, their kids should do well in school. People feel they have more power to demand high scores.''</p>
        <p>In Edgemont, Liz Oppenheimer, a mother of kindergarten, sixth-, and seventh- grade children, speculated, decidedly tongue in cheek: ''The water is better on the other side. Maybe we don't have as many doctors and lawyers as they do. You can't get so anal about these things. How can you take it seriously?''</p>
        <p>But still, seriously was how many were taking it.</p>
        <p>In Long Beach, Linda Sinowitz said she planned to settle home with the newspaper this evening so she could analyze how her third-grade son Scott's school did compared with others. ''I want him to be on par with everybody else,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Susan Bigger, a real estate broker who was sitting at lunch with Mrs. McTeigue at a Larchmont cafe, said, ''People use them like the Bible to decide where they're going to live.''.</p>
        <p>Mrs. McTeigue said: ''It's frustrating. We have a hard time convincing them to look in other neighborhoods where we know the schools are very good. They don't want to see outside this very narrow parameter.''</p>
        <p>''We encourage parents to visit the schools,'' she added. ''Very few do. Everyone feels pressure to look at these test scores. Very few are motivated to actually check out the schools.''</p>
