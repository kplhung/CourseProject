        <p>Re ''Israel's Bittersweet Moment: One Step Out of Isolation at U.N.'' (news article, June 1): Inviting Israel to join the Western European and Others Group at the United Nations is a historic development that begins to redress the decades-long anomaly whereby Israel had been the only  member state not eligible to take part fully in the United Nations.</p>
        <p>While we are delighted that the diplomatic and public opinion campaign we began seven years ago produced this milestone, we are also grateful for the efforts of American and European officials, in particular, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke.</p>

        <p>Eventually, of course, the objective is to achieve permanent and equal status for Israel in the regional system, consistent with the United Nations Charter's promise of equal treatment for all member states.</p>
