        <p>IN the two years that Oregon voters and courts have spent wrangling over Measure 58, the nation's first voter-approved initiative granting all adult adoptees access to their birth certificates, the legal fight here has often been cast as the most excruciating of moral dilemmas: Don't adoptees have a right to see the most basic information about where they come from? Don't women who give up children for adoption have the right to retain their privacy?</p>
        <p>But Helen Hill, the 45-year-old adoptee who spearheaded the successful campaign for the measure in 1998 and celebrated a final victory this week when a Supreme Court justice declined to stand in its way, says she is puzzled by the notion of such a dilemma. Measure 58, this sculptor and elementary-school art teacher maintains, will prove a win-win for all involved.</p>
        <p>''I just have never understood this notion that it could ruin somebody's life, to have the child she gave up at birth come back into her life someday,'' said Ms. Hill, speaking yesterday in the living room of her log home, on a bluff with a spectacular view of the Pacific in this little town on the Oregon coast.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, I mean, it's an honorable thing she did,'' said Ms. Hill, growing ever more animated. ''She shouldn't have to hide, and we shouldn't have to go without that basic knowledge, and that medical information, because of some lingering shame from the 1950's.''</p>
        <p>That is not a view shared by all, of course. After passage of the measure 18 months ago, a group of anonymous birth mothers sued to block the law. One said through her lawyer that the whole debate had brought her ''flashbacks and nightmares,'' while another described the prospect of a phone call from her birth child as ''a bomb held over your head.'' Another said her birth child, whom she never wished to see, was a product of rape.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hill has heard all those arguments, but she just shakes her head in gentle but firm disagreement. ''M-58 is not about forcing relationships between unwilling people,'' she said of the initiative. ''It's all about healing the shame, and taking adoption out of the dark ages.''</p>
        <p>When Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on Tuesday refused a request from the birth mothers to block the law, thus letting stand a ruling by the state's highest court, Oregon officials immediately said they would begin sending applicants copies of their birth certificates, which in most cases bear the birth mother's name.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Hill, that was a final victory, even if one that offers her no practical gain: she wasn't even born in Oregon, and besides, she has already found her birth parents.</p>
        <p>Her search for them is a compelling tale, one that begins when, as a 10-year-old girl, she discovered some old adoption manuals behind the bed of her parents' home in Kansas City. Had she been adopted, she demanded of her mother. Yes, came the answer.</p>
        <p>''That caused immediate confusion, bewilderment, even a big depression,'' recalled Ms. Hill, a passionate woman with long, dark hair and dark eyes. ''The seeds of this whole ballot measure were probably sown right there,'' she added with a laugh.</p>
        <p>After decades and thousands of dollars spent on private investigators, Ms. Hill found herself with the information she needed, including a file that described her birth mother as a ''healthy, attractive girl who wears her hair in a long bob.'' Ms. Hill was 41. Her birth mother, in Des Moines, was 64.</p>
        <p>So she just picked up the phone one day. ''My name is Helen, and I'm calling about a very personal matter. I was born on March 24, 1955, in Kansas City.''</p>
        <p>''There was a silence on the other end,'' she recalled yesterday. ''A very long silence. And after that she said: 'I love you. I've always loved you.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hill soon flew to Iowa, and they met.</p>
        <p>''It's almost too much for a human being to deal with,'' Ms. Hill remembered. ''There's an incredible amount of intimacy presupposed with this person who is a total stranger. And yet there are things frighteningly familiar about this person. Her scent, her voice. I mean, the way her fingernails looked. It blows your mind.''</p>
        <p>That was the reunion with her birth mother, with whom she remains friendly (as she does with her adoptive mother). A bit later she sent a letter to her birth father, in Albuquerque.</p>
        <p>He was a dashing lieutenant, back from the Korean War, when he met her birth mother, and the two had a brief but passionate romance. He never even knew that Ms. Hill existed. But having received her letter, he picked up the phone and called her right away.</p>
        <p>''He's this very exuberant Italian-American fellow, with a voice like Al Pacino's,'' Ms. Hill said. ''He was stunned, but he was happy. He said to me: 'Your mama was the love of my life. You were a love child.' ''</p>
        <p>Not all adoptees share the intense curiosity of Ms. Hill, who drives a van bedecked with images of planets and asteroids. Experts say two-thirds of adoptees do not seek out birth parents, even when there are ways to pursue the information. (Of the third who do, about 80 percent are women.)</p>
        <p>CRITICS of the Oregon law say that mutually desired reunions are wonderful, but not those forced upon an unsuspecting or even unwilling birth mother. Some have said the prospect might even so tip the scales for some pregnant women as to lead them to opt for abortion.</p>
        <p>''That's simply a fundamental misunderstanding of human nature,'' said Ms. Hill, who has three children of her own (a daughter, 21, and two sons, 19 and 14) and who is strongly in favor of abortion rights. ''A woman doesn't go and have an abortion because she's afraid her child might find her out someday. That's not the way the heart and soul works.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hill, who is no longer married, estimates that she spent about $90,000 of her own money on the campaign for Measure 58. She also got a friend to lend her Max, the golden retriever who was a powerful mascot for the campaign. ''Max has his papers,'' read the yes-on-58 ad. ''We want ours.''</p>
        <p>Adoptees-rights organizations hope the Oregon law will propel similar movements in other states. Ms. Hill said she just wanted to go back to her art and her teaching, and to her current campaign to build a youth center in a nearby town. But she supports the fight.</p>
        <p>''I've never believed in anything so much in my whole life,'' she said. ''I grew up steeped in the secrecy and shame that the closed-record system perpetuates, and I don't want anybody else going through what I went through. It's really as simple as that.''</p>
