        <p>Next week at the United Nations, representatives of nearly every country and thousands of non-governmental groups are meeting to talk about what the world has done to improve the lives of women. The delegates will evaluate what has happened since the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing, when 187 nations endorsed a wide range of goals and promised specific actions.</p>
        <p>The subject of women's needs is, of course, a broad one, encompassing poverty -- 70 percent of the poor are female -- health, domestic violence, armed conflict, political representation and other issues. One achievement of the Beijing conference was its acknowledgment that women need to be heard in debates on just about every kind of policy.</p>

        <p>Next week at the United Nations, representatives of nearly every country and thousands of non-governmental groups are meeting to talk about what the world has done to improve the lives of women. The delegates will evaluate what has happened since the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing, when 187 nations endorsed a wide range of goals and promised specific actions.</p>
        <p>The subject of women's needs is, of course, a broad one, encompassing poverty -- 70 percent of the poor are female -- health, domestic violence, armed conflict, political representation and other issues. One achievement of the Beijing conference was its acknowledgment that women need to be heard in debates on just about every kind of policy.</p>
        <p>The Beijing conference was the fourth U.N. conference on women, but more than the others it established concrete targets -- such as abolishing laws that discriminate against women economically or increasing the number of women in public administration -- and set timetables for measuring progress. Activists have found these benchmarks crucial to holding governments accountable.</p>
        <p>In 1998 the Women's Environment and Development Organization, a New York-based network of groups, did a survey of progress. It found that most of the governments represented at Beijing had drawn up plans to keep their promises, and 64 countries had changed laws. The growth of local women's groups has been the most important reason for these advances. Some 30,000 activists attended the Beijing conference, and they have used its platform to organize women and to press governments to keep their commitments.</p>
        <p>But most of what governments call action is still just lofty talk, and is not yet affecting women. The inaction stems partly from cultural resistance and partly from lack of money to finance new programs.  Governments argue, persuasively, that they are overwhelmed by AIDS, debt payments and budget cuts demanded by the International Monetary Fund. But women's issues have never been a priority, even when progress, as with educating girls, would benefit the nation as a whole.</p>
        <p>In addition, many governments are not even changing egregious laws, which costs nothing. In several countries women may not inherit property. In much of Latin America, a rapist goes free if he marries the victim. In several Islamic countries, a man may kill a female relative who has disgraced the family. In Pakistan, women's testimony has no value in rape cases. In Kuwait, women still may not vote. ''We have prepared people to ask their government: 'Did you do what you said you would do?' '' says Litha Musyimi-Ogana, a Kenyan activist, who could be speaking for women's groups everywhere.  This is a big achievement, but the answer in too many places is ''no.''</p>
