        <p>Mike Piazza slowly limped across the clubhouse yesterday, a pair of black sunglasses over his eyes and no noticeable wounds on his head. Piazza, who woke up feeling groggy, walked past teammates, past his locker and into the trainer's room. The trainers were waiting.</p>
        <p>Thirty minutes later, Piazza was being driven to New York Hospital to have a CAT scan on his head. Piazza was drilled in the head by Gary Sheffield's bat on Sheffield's backswing Wednesday in Los Angeles, suffering a slight concussion and needing one stitch to mend a cut.</p>
        <p>After flying cross-country with his teammates after the game and showing enough improvement on Thursday that the Mets said he would probably start last night, Piazza woke up woozy yesterday. So Piazza underwent an exam, the results were negative and the Mets said there were no medical restrictions on him.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't say I was concerned,'' Piazza said. ''I was sluggish, though. I just wanted to be safe and get it checked. I'm feeling a little better. Hopefully, one more night is all it takes.''</p>
        <p>Piazza, who has a small gash on the left side of his forehead that is barely visible, said he was pondering whether to use the hockey-style helmet because it provides more protection. The catcher said he thought some of the grogginess was from the cross-country flight.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't headaches, it was fogginess,'' he said. ''I was a little slow comprehending things. It's tough to play when you're a little slow.''</p>
        <p>Piazza said that he would probably play tonight but that he would not make that decision until he got to Shea.</p>
        <p>Even without Piazza's test, it was a busy day for the Mets as they traded pitcher Bill Pulsipher to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Lenny Harris, the former Mets utility player, and cash. It was the second time in 11 months that the Mets traded Pulsipher, 26, once touted as a cornerstone of their future along with Jason Isringhausen and Paul Wilson.</p>
        <p>Pulsipher failed to win the fifth spot in the rotation during spring training. He was 2-3 with a 6.55 earned run average in seven games at Class AAA Norfolk and spent just 17 days with the Mets, going 0-2 with a 12.15 E.R.A. in two starts.</p>
        <p>''Billy had his struggles up here,'' General Manager Steve Phillips said. ''He didn't put it together down there, either.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the trade, the Mets designated outfielder Jon Nunnally for assignment, optioned reliever Jim Mann to Norfolk, purchased outfielder Ryan McGuire's contract from Norfolk and recalled catcher Vance Wilson from Class AAA. When Harris arrives, Wilson or McGuire will return to Norfolk.</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine would rather keep Wilson as a third catcher, so he can use Todd Pratt as a pinch-hitter and have a replacement for Piazza.</p>
        <p>By adding Harris, the Mets have upgraded their bench with another left-handed hitter who consistently makes contact. Harris, who has played third base, second base, first base and the outfield in a 13-year career, was batting .188 with 1 homer and 13 runs batted in for the Diamondbacks.</p>
        <p>But the Mets believe Harris will provide more than Nunnally, who batted .189 with 2 homers and 6 R.B.I. and struck out 26 times in 43 at-bats. The Mets have 7 to 10 days to release, trade or outright Nunnally to the minors. If they outright him, he can decline and be a free agent.</p>
        <p>Harris, 35, sounded giddy about returning to the Mets. He batted .232 with 6 homers and 17 R.B.I. for the Mets in 1998, striking out 12 times in 168 at-bats.</p>
        <p>''I'm always excited to go back to New York,'' Harris said by phone. ''It's a place that motivates me.''</p>
