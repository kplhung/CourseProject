        <p>The orchestra leader Tito Puente, who died Wednesday at the age of 77, fronted a hot Latin jazz orchestra for more than half a century and was broadly influential as a percussionist, composer and arranger. Known in the Latino community as El Rey -- The King -- Mr. Puente is primarily viewed as a pillar of Latin music. But he was also an American original -- and a crossover figure in the 1950's, before the term was invented.</p>
        <p>Born in New York at the height of the Jazz Age, he made it his life's mission to form a revolutionary fusion of the Afro-Cuban rhythms of Latin music with arrangements derived from traditional jazz. As a friend said recently, ''he came out of nowhere,'' creating a music that was both danceable and intelligent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Puente, the son of Puerto Rican immigrants, was born in East Harlem in 1923. After playing briefly with the noted singer and percussionist Machito, he dropped out of school to start his own group and remained a band leader until his death. He made more than 100 records and won five Grammys. He helped to begin the mambo craze in the 1950's. The period featured other wildly popular Latin bands and became the subject of ''The Mambo Kings Play Songs Of Love,'' a celebrated novel by the Cuban-American writer Oscar Hijuelos.</p>
        <p>Mr. Puente's music was clearly shaped by orchestras like those commanded by Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Fletcher Henderson, bands that used dance rhythms and jazz improvisations to enormous effect. Jazz grew cerebral as the decades moved on, culminating in the laid-back music of  Miles Davis, which began in the ''Birth of the Cool'' sessions at the start of the 1950's.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Puente continued to swing, with percussion-driven music that was covered by younger musicians, including Carlos Santana. At an age when many people have retired, El Rey was playing more than 200 gigs a year and was scheduled to perform in Manhattan on Wednesday, when he entered the hospital for heart surgery. Tito Puente liked to say of his beginnings in East Harlem that he was ''born in rhythm.'' In half a century as percussionist in his bands, he spent his life in rhythm as well.</p>
