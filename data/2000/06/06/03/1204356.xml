        <p>Cuba is prepared to negotiate with American companies that had property confiscated when Fidel Castro came to power 40 years ago, according to a United States Chamber of Commerce official who returned from Havana today.</p>
        <p>A dialogue on settling claims would be the first since Mr. Castro took power in 1959 and seized assets from many foreigners who owned houses or did business there.

        <p>Cuba is prepared to negotiate with American companies that had property confiscated when Fidel Castro came to power 40 years ago, according to a United States Chamber of Commerce official who returned from Havana today.</p>
        <p>A dialogue on settling claims would be the first since Mr. Castro took power in 1959 and seized assets from many foreigners who owned houses or did business there. The United States and Cuba do not have formal diplomatic relations and have not held bilateral talks on the disputed assets, Clinton administration officials said.</p>
        <p>The offer is being made as several American lawmakers, the Chamber of Commerce and some American corporate executives have sought to improve ties with Cuba, which is subject to a strict trade embargo by the United States. Some American companies are eager to see the embargo eased so that they can conduct business in Cuba, where Canadian and European rivals have invested hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>The chamber official, L. Craig Johnstone, a vice president, said senior Cuban officials were ''receptive to the notion'' of negotiating settlements when he met them this week. He said Foreign Affairs Minister Felipe Perez-Roque and the president of the National Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon, were among the officials who expressed interest.</p>
        <p>''There's a strong sentiment in Cuba today that the relationship has the potential of improving,'' Mr. Johnstone said. ''I think this is an attempt to incur good will and appear reasonable.''</p>
        <p>A Cuban Foreign Ministry official said he had no information about discussions with Mr. Johnstone. He said his government had long offered to discuss compensation claims with the United States, because Cuba wants to be compensated for losses incurred under the embargo.</p>
        <p>Some 5,900 American companies and individuals have $6 billion in claims for property seized after 1959, an administration official said. The claims were adjudicated by American courts in the 1970's and have been pending. The official said he was not aware of any recent Cuban proposals to discuss settlements.</p>
        <p>American officials said they did not expect much progress in resolving claims until relations were normalized. But the Cuban officials' overture seems intended to bolster American business support for better ties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnstone said the talks would be sponsored by the chamber and held outside diplomatic channels. He said the Cuban officials had indicated a preference to discuss claims with selected companies, but added that they did not rule out resolving disputes with other claimants down the road.</p>
        <p>It is unclear how many American claimants are eager to reach settlements with Cuba outside official channels. Mr. Johnstone said several companies in the chamber's corporate membership had indicated a willingness to do so, but he declined to name them.</p>
