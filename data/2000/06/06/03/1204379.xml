        <p>Is this move real, or is volatility just going wild?</p>
        <p>That may be the most difficult question for stock market watchers, particularly with regard to the Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by technology stocks that regularly zoom and fall.</p>
        <p>This week was the best ever for the Nasdaq composite, which rose 18.98 percent. That was nearly twice the gain in the previous best week for the index, a 9.71 percent rise recorded only six weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Yet, even with the two best weeks ever for the Nasdaq market, the index is down 6.3 percent since the end of 1999. Four of the five weeks between the two great weeks were losers.</p>
        <p>Moreover, this year has also had the worst week ever for the Nasdaq market, a 25.3 percent plunge in the week ended April 14. That decline set off warnings of severe economic effects if the stock market continued to fall, which it did not.</p>
        <p>You can also see the extraordinary volatility measured daily. In the history of the Nasdaq stock market, dating back to 1971, there have been 26 days in which the average closed with a gain or loss of at least 5 percent. Exactly half of them have occurred in 2000, three of them this week, when there were only four trading days because of Memorial Day.</p>
        <p>Volatility is not as great in the broader market as it is in the Nasdaq market, largely because other stocks do not swing as violently as do many technology issues. But it is unusual: So far this year, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 has risen or fallen by 1 percent or more on 49 percent of the trading days. That is well below the 79 percent figure posted by the Nasdaq composite, but it is up from the S.&amp; P.'s 37 percent in 1999 and is the highest for that index since 1938, when stock prices swung wildly in the Great Depression.</p>
        <p>One explanation for the extraordinary volatility relates to the way the Internet revolution has made it possible for individual investors to trade rapidly at very low costs. Many have done so. If those traders tend to move in herds, leaping in when prices are rising and out when they are falling, then they can exaggerate any market move.</p>
        <p>Some volatility no doubt relates to the fact that other traders are only slowly learning to deal with the market effects of that additional trading. There are precedents for such confusion. In the 1970's, institutional investors drastically increased their trading of big blocks of stock, and volatility soared amid a lot of hand-wringing about the dangers of such trading. Similarly, the rise of index arbitrage trading in the 1980's increased volatility and set off complaints that the markets were being destroyed. In both cases, investors learned to deal with the new form of trading, and volatility subsided.</p>
        <p>Recently, volume has been relatively weak compared with the peaks earlier this year. Low volume can also increase volatility, with fewer traders willing to step up to take the other side of a trade when large numbers of investors want to get in or out.</p>
        <p>None of those explanations, it should be noted, has the slightest relationship to what really is or is not going on in the economy. But uncertainty about that also seems to have increased.</p>
        <p>The huge run-up in technology stocks, particularly Internet stocks, from last summer through early March, in part reflected hopes that the new economy would produce huge profits some day, and that those who bought were getting in on the ground floor of a new skyscraper. Others thought that idea was ludicrous, and that valuations were completely ridiculous.</p>
        <p>In such a polarized investment climate, prices can swing violently, simply because there are few investors likely to move in to buy on a small decline, or to sell on a small increase. So a relatively small increase in buying or selling pressure can create a big move.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve also seems determined to raise interest rates until the economy slows. Because of that bias, reports of a strong economy can seem bad, since they make further interest rate increases more likely, while reports of a slowing economy, as were stimulated by yesterday's employment news, can seem like good news. All that could change, of course, if fears grew that the Fed was likely to bring on a recession rather than just slow the economy to a more moderate rate of growth.</p>
        <p>In the end, the extraordinary volatility may mean investors are nervous and confused. They know that, for two decades, buying stocks has almost always been a better move than selling them. They also worry about losing some of those big profits. With those dueling concerns, greed can turn to fear, and back to greed, within weeks if not days.</p>
        <p>So what does any big move in stock prices -- either up or down -- really say about the future of the economy? In retrospect, the pundits may be able to discern a pattern. But for now, there is no way to know which move, if any, has real economic significance.</p>
