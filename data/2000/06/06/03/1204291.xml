        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Anthony Lewis's May 27 column about South Africa was refreshingly positive. When I was living there last year, I could see that there had been a remarkable transformation, not just among elite groups but also in the banks, supermarkets and stores.</p>

        <p>Anthony Lewis's May 27 column about South Africa was refreshingly positive. When I was living there last year, I could see that there had been a remarkable transformation, not just among elite groups but also in the banks, supermarkets and stores.</p>
        <p>White and black co-workers care for one another. An Afrikaner acquaintance attended an integrated party wearing an African dress borrowed from her black colleague, something unheard of a decade ago.</p>
        <p>The government's success is seen in hundreds of thousands of new or refurbished houses. Miles of roads have been paved. Water and electricity are available to more people.</p>
        <p>I recall the statement of a South African exile: ''We must help this government to succeed or we will have fought for nothing.'' That is commitment.</p>
