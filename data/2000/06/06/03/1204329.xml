        <p>On most mornings, Sgt. Joseph T. Kersting brings the tools of his trade to patrol the streets of East Harlem: a plexiglass shield, an electronic stun gun, a life preserver, a rope and a heavy-duty fire extinguisher.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, that rope got a workout: a sheep was loose, dashing through traffic on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive in a mad spectacle that drew police officers, an agent of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and some commuters in hot pursuit.</p>
        <p>No one knows how the sheep made its way onto the highway. Had it come from the woods north of the city, it would have had to travel through the Bronx and cross the Harlem River. One theory was that it escaped from a slaughterhouse at 126th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, then journeyed crosstown.</p>
        <p>''People were pretty shocked,'' the sergeant said, acknowledging that he himself was stunned when he first saw the sheep trotting down Second Avenue near East 120th Street between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. ''It's not that common to see a sheep running down the F.D.R.''</p>
        <p>With their emergency lights flashing but no sirens, they chased the young animal, which the A.S.P.C.A. later said was ''a juvenile, barely more than a lamb,''  down Second Avenue. ''A couple of civilians tried to help us and no one could stop the sheep,'' the sergeant said.</p>
        <p>At East 96th Street, they were joined by the A.S.P.C.A. agent, Tina Salaks, who was sitting in traffic when she saw the bizarre chase pass her by.</p>
        <p>''I saw the police car coming down with its lights on, but they weren't able to get through traffic,'' she said. ''Then I saw the sheep run by and I realized, 'It's a sheep and it's running towards the F.D.R.' ''</p>
        <p>After causing a traffic jam, the sheep ran up the exit ramp from the northbound lanes, heading south toward the pastoral bliss of Gracie Mansion and Carl Schurz Park. Instead, it chose to enter the tunnel under Gracie Mansion.</p>
        <p>The sergeant; his partner, Officer Larry Lopez; and Ms. Salaks -- aided by a commuter -- were able to trap the sheep in the southbound lanes of the tunnel, where traffic had been cut off. Ms. Salaks picked him up and bundled him into the back of a patrol car, and he was rushed down to the A.S.P.C.A. on East 92nd.</p>
        <p>While he may once have been destined for the dinner table, by yesterday afternoon, the 49-pound sheep had seen its fortunes change considerably. After a thorough checkup by A.S.P.C.A. veterinarians, he was happily munching sweet hay and grain.</p>
        <p>The sheep, named Franklin for the highway where he made good his escape, will most likely live out his years at Green Chimneys, a sanctuary for abused animals in upstate New York, said Valerie Bedziner, a spokeswoman for the A.S.P.C.A.</p>
        <p>''I'm just happy it has a nice ending and that he will live to see another day and hopefully get fat and sassy,'' Ms. Salaks said.</p>
