        <p>Deion Sanders, one of the more talented and high profile players in National Football League history, was released yesterday by the Dallas Cowboys. But don't feel too bad for the Pro Bowl cornerback and kick returner, because he will quite likely find a home in Washington by next week.</p>
        <p>There is a slim chance the Cowboys will try to rework a deal with Sanders, or that Sanders could end up in Tampa Bay, but all indications, several team and league officials said yesterday, are that Sanders will be with the Redskins by Monday or Tuesday.

Dallas released Sanders because of salary-cap reasons.</p>
        <p>''Deion was a great player for us,'' Jerry Jones, the Cowboys' owner, said. ''But because of salary-cap reasons, we can't afford to keep him.''</p>
        <p>The Redskins might play Sanders at safety as much as cornerback, and his kick-return skills would make their special teams dangerous.</p>
