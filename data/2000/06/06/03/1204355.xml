        <p>With a mix of sadness and anticipation, NASA engineers prepared today for the fiery death this weekend of a giant spacecraft that has made pioneering discoveries in gamma ray astronomy.</p>
        <p>After gradually lowering the orbit of the 17-ton craft, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, with a series of rocket firings -- a process they have already begun -- technicians will guide it into Earth's atmosphere early Sunday, Eastern Daylight Time, for a fatal plunge into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
        <p>This is the first time the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will have intentionally guided so large a craft to its destruction, in hope of minimizing danger to people on the ground. The bus-size spacecraft has been operating with only two of its three stabilizing gyroscopes since December, and NASA officials calculated that if it lost another gyroscope and came down on its own, there would be a 1-in-1,000 chance that someone would be killed by the debris.</p>
        <p>So engineers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who have controlled the scientific mission of the observatory during its nine years in space, now find themselves getting ready for its death.</p>
        <p>''The mood right now is pretty sad,'' Dr. Neil Gehrels, Compton project scientist, said in an interview from Goddard today. ''It's been a great mission with a great spacecraft, and now it's ending.''</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, engineers began a four-stage process to slowly lower the observatory in preparation for its final descent, into the atmosphere. That day a 23-minute firing of small thruster rockets aboard the craft brought the low point of its orbit down to 226 miles, from 316. Then a 26-minute firing on Wednesday night lowered the orbit to 155 miles and let engineers fine-tune their projections for the spacecraft's terminal dive into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The final stages for Compton's controlled re-entry are to begin on Sunday at 12:01 a.m., E.D.T., with a 26-minute rocket burn that slows the craft and lowers it to a 95-mile-high orbit. This is to be followed by a fourth and final thruster firing, of 30 minutes' duration starting at 1:30 a.m., that will nudge Compton down to 48 miles. At that altitude, the thicker atmosphere will begin heating and breaking apart the spacecraft, which will be streaking in at 16,000 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>NASA officials said about six tons of metal debris was expected to survive re-entry and smash into a remote part of the Pacific about 2,500 miles southeast of Hawaii about 2:20 a.m., E.D.T. The Coast Guard, the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies have issued warnings for ships and planes to avoid that area during the operation.</p>
        <p>NASA has arranged for the Air Force to monitor the final destruction of Compton with one of its special Cobra Ball missile-tracking airplanes, equipped with radar scanners and infrared and optical sensors. Officials want the plane to track different pieces of the spacecraft as it breaks up, to help NASA refine computer programs designed to predict the behavior of large craft as they re-enter the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gehrels said several large pieces of the Compton observatory were expected to survive re-entry almost intact before hitting the ocean, including the solid aluminum bus, or keel, on which the craft was built; a large sodium-iodide crystal weighing several hundred pounds; and four 125-pound pieces of tungsten that are part of one of the instruments aboard.</p>
        <p>Also raining down will be 5,500 bolts of various sizes made of heat-resistant titanium metal. ''These are going to come down basically intact, like the spray from a shotgun blast,'' Dr. Gehrels said.</p>
        <p>Compton will be the biggest spacecraft to fall from orbit since the United States' 100-ton Skylab space station burned up over the Indian Ocean in July 1979. Although most of Skylab disintegrated in the atmosphere, some pieces survived the uncontrolled re-entry and landed in Western Australia. No one was injured in the Skylab episode, but NASA officials say the risk of injury from descent of a large craft is too great to leave to chance.</p>
        <p>Some scientists have criticized NASA, however, saying it acted too quickly in deciding to bring down Compton, for which there is currently no substitute for observations in gamma ray astronomy.</p>
        <p>The $670 million spacecraft, deployed by the space shuttle Atlantis in April 1991, is one of NASA's Great Observatories series, like the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory, designed to study the heavens at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays, which are invisible and have energies greater than visible light and ultraviolet or X-ray radiation, appear to come from the most violent cosmic phenomena and reveal details about the universe that otherwise could not be seen.</p>
        <p>Dr. James M. Ryan, a professor of physics at the University of New Hampshire, who used one of Compton's special telescopes, said NASA had not seriously pursued contingency plans like running the observatory with two gyroscopes, or even one. Many scientists, including some at NASA, are angered by the decision to kill Compton, he said, but are afraid to speak out publicly.</p>
        <p>''No section of astronomy has hung so much on one spacecraft as the gamma ray people,'' Dr. Ryan said in a telephone interview. ''We are going to be blind to a huge chunk of the universe for years.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Edward J. Weiler, NASA's chief scientist, said it was his decision to bring the observatory down now, because waiting, he said, would have increased the risk of human injury from an uncontrolled re-entry. He acknowledged that engineers at Goddard had come up with a theoretical backup plan to continue operating the observatory and bring it down later, but he said that it would have increased risk to humans by eight times and that there was no way to test it. And engineers calculated that there was a 1-in-10 chance that a second gyroscope would fail in as little as a year, he said.</p>
        <p>''Could the Goddard engineers, if they had more time, come up with a way to control the observatory?'' Dr. Weiler said. ''I'd bet my house that they could. But I can't bet a human life on it.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Weiler noted that the Compton mission had been planned to last three to five years, and had lasted nine. ''We got a lot of value out of this observatory, and scientists will be analyzing data from Compton for years,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gehrels, of Goddard, said that some 20 percent of Compton's data had not been studied yet and that analysis of what had been gathered before the spacecraft's science instruments were turned off a week ago could occupy scientists for five years.</p>
        <p>Further, ''the silver lining here is that there are some exciting new gamma ray missions coming soon,'' Dr. Gehrels said, including the launching of Europe's Integral spacecraft in 2002, the flight of the United States' Explorer Swift mission in 2003 or 2004, and the launching of the giant Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope around 2005.</p>
