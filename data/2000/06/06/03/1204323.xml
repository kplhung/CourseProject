Just a short list of recent flameouts includes boo.com (a fashion site that burned through $135 million in months), den.net (a ''digital entertainment network'' panting haplessly after the demographic Holy Grail of Generation Y), and RedRocket.com (toys from Nickelodeon).

        <p>At long last: Schadenfreude dot-com.</p>
        <p>This has been a great spring not only for those rooting for the comeuppance of Bill Gates, but for anyone who has had quite enough of New Economy New Millionaires and their irritatingly unostentatious brand of ostentation. Just a short list of recent flameouts includes boo.com (a fashion site that burned through $135 million in months), den.net (a ''digital entertainment network'' panting haplessly after the demographic Holy Grail of Generation Y), and RedRocket.com (toys from Nickelodeon). Among the countless former high-fliers in a Wall Street tailspin are Drkoop.com and Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, whose shares have dropped from $333 in March to around $23 today, amid investigations for alleged accounting irregularities.</p>
        <p>Most of these sites rode in on a wave of hype as excessive as those that herald Hollywood's bigger bombs. (On the Web, as in show business, the big hits are often sleepers.) Mr. Saylor was being canonized in the press as a Medici -- for underwriting a dubious, if free, online university -- just as his stockholders fell on his sword. Now that these start-ups are in peril or ruin, their press is almost as apocalyptic as the initial buzz was celebratory. When Disney bought a 60 percent interest in Toysmart.com back in August, an expert at Forrester Research gushed to The Associated Press, ''There's nothing bad in it for Disney.'' When Toysmart went belly-up last week, another Forrester analyst authoritatively told The A.P. it was ''the wrong company selling the wrong product at the wrong time.'' Now you tell us!</p>
        <p>You have to wonder if these pundits visit the sites they initially tout. I found from personal experience five months ago that den.net was nearly impenetrable even on a fast connection and that no one in its office would come to the phone to explain why. If anyone wonders whether Barnes &amp; Noble has mastered online bookselling, just try, as I did this week, to order from its not-ready-for-e-time ''same-day delivery'' service. With competitors like this, no one at Amazon need go sleepless in Seattle.</p>
        <p>Emotionally satisfying as these rags-to-riches-to-rags dot-com sagas may be, however, they are often irrelevant to the long and looming future of the Internet. Like some other favorite story lines of the past few years -- the kiddie-porn scare, the ''Blair Witch'' craze, the day-trader menace -- tales of the Nasdaq bubble are transient sideshows in the Web's early gold-rush phase that may look like quaint olden-days phenomena once the Internet is seamlessly integrated into our lives. As with the original California gold rush's prospectors, it's inevitable that more dot-com prospectuses are going to pan fool's gold than pay dirt. The disasters won't slow the progress of this new technology any more than earlier economic setbacks did the spread of the railroad and electricity.</p>
        <p>The truly illuminating Internet stories are sometimes less visible than the morality plays of hubristic e-celebrities and evanescent I.P.O.'s. That may be because they are buried in the very architecture of a technology few of us laymen understand -- or because they involve the media's own selfish interests. Or both.</p>
        <p>Into this category fall the newest corporate marriages in the increasingly intertwined Internet-cable-entertainment-telecommunications industry: AT&amp;T-MediaOne and AOL-Time Warner. These mammoth couplings have been dissected as stock-price stories and captains-of-industry personality profiles, to be sure. But if it hadn't been for the divine intervention of another corporate giant last month -- Disney -- even a hint of the worst-case scenarios possible in this new media landscape would have been invisible to most Americans. Few still understand how these new powerhouses could make our current cable and phone companies look like kindly mom-and-pop operations by comparison.</p>
        <p>What Time Warner did to Disney, throwing ABC off its cable in 11 cities until a public outcry forced a retreat, is just a tiny window into how these corporations can behave in their even more powerful future, when cable TV service will be inseparable from Internet service. There is nothing to stop one of these new megaliths from exerting a larger and more surreptitious chokehold on all the electronic services that their cable wires will speed by the bundle into our homes tomorrow, from chat rooms to e-shopping to movies. Even in the few weeks since the Disney fiasco, when you might think Time Warner would be too chastened to risk more censure, it has been caught misbehaving in Texas, where its cable company offered its employees bounties to place bogus orders for a rival Internet service offered by Southwestern Bell.</p>
        <p>Time Warner has since apologized for its recent transgressions, but if it can try to squelch Disney (itself described by The Wall Street Journal as ''one of America's most aggressive corporate bullies''), imagine what it can do to smaller companies and consumers once Disney and the other giants inevitably make deals to secure their pieces of the pie.</p>
        <p>Not unlike Windows, which blackballed Web software not made by Microsoft, or the most recent edition of AOL, which snaked into its users' computer settings to override competing programs, the future AOL-TW threshold into the Internet/TV can be engineered for nefarious purposes. It could make its own products, like Time and CNN, come on screen easily and fast while slowing down (or blocking) the alternatives, whether Newsweek or Drudgewannabe.com. It could do the same with merchants, TV channels or non-AOL Internet service providers.</p>
        <p>In other words, it could control the entertainment and even the news grid on your computer/TV screen much as the movie studios (including Time Warner's ancestor, Warner Brothers) limited Americans' entertainment choices in cities until antitrust action ended such restrictive practices in 1948. The result wouldn't be the democratic, go-anywhere-you-want Internet of yore but a more elaborate version of cable TV, in which your cable company adjudicates both your programming choices and cyber-activities (and could monitor all of them).</p>
        <p>It would be like ''someone constantly dealing the deck and knowing every card and shuffling at will, but never letting you know if you're being dealt every card or not,'' says Jeffrey Chester of the Center for Media Education. Gerald Levin, of Time Warner, and Steve Case, of AOL, have pledged not to be naughty, but even if we take them at their word, they'll not be running their company forever. What's more, what they say already fails to square with what they do. This week USA Today persuasively charged AOL with foot-dragging on last summer's promise to open up its instant-messenger system to all non-AOL Internet users.</p>
        <p>The antidote to any possible future misbehavior is not necessarily to stop the merger -- a non-starter anyway -- but for regulators to set simple rules of the information highway (and build them into its construction) so that all comers have equal access to its various lanes. Yet most of the political pressure on Washington comes from the media giants, not the spottily informed public. TV news, the main news source for most Americans, is mum about this part of the merger story, in which so much is at stake for its corporate parents; it's easier to talk about Mr. Levin going tieless.</p>
        <p>Nor do politicians want to take on media corporations whose news divisions cover them and whose donations increasingly support them. At my request, the Center for Responsive Politics broke down total campaign contributions by industry over the past decade, and the result shows a rapid increase of total donations by media, communications and electronics companies since the explosion of the Internet -- a stiffer increase than even those made by the health care industry. The parties more or less split the loot.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has taken a ''do-nothing attitude'' about ensuring fairness for the millions who will connect by cable into the Internet, according to Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard law professor who has more than anyone framed this issue. Nor is there any Teddy Roosevelt Republican in sight to ride to the rescue. Still, some public-interest advocates are hopeful that voters will be provoked into anger over time, if only because media companies arrogant enough to pull the plug on Regis Philbin may, like Microsoft before them, eventually overplay their hand. But it may take something as startling as a totalitarian new voice saying ''You've got mail'' -- Charlton Heston's, perhaps -- to wake the country up.</p>
