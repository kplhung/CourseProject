        <p>With less than three minutes left, the ball was in his hands on the right block, a few feet from the basket. Patrick Ewing had to hurry and barely got his feet set when he lofted a short jump hook. Not even close.</p>
        <p>The game was lost, the groaning from a sellout crowd more intense than ever.</p>
        <p>''It's over, Patrick!'' one man yelled. ''Give it up.''</p>
        <p>Dies the season, dies the quest for a championship ring. Today, all his misguided detractors get what they wanted: a reduced role, fewer minutes, a nearly Ewing-less team.</p>
        <p>He still has another year on his contract, but unofficially, the Patrick Era expired last night at Madison Square Garden, burning out with Indiana's 93-80 victory in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals.</p>
        <p>And now the blaming begins anew.</p>
        <p>On the last day of the Knicks' season, Coach Jeff Van Gundy was asked whether we would rather lose with Ewing or win without him.</p>
        <p>''The question was actually posed,'' the coach said. ''I looked at the person like he had four heads. I mean, that's how people depict us, like we have this love-in every day. I have loyalty towards him because he's a very good player and he's helped us win a lot, just like I have loyalty to the other players on the team. They just aren't under attack right now.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy spoke before the disappointing defeat of Game 6, before Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers made the Garden still and the shaken masses shuffled out into the humid night, yelling, ''Houston, get off the court!'' and ''Give Ewing the $18 million and tell him to retire!''</p>
        <p>The 7-foot, 37-year-old man trudged off for the final time this season, amid a few cheers and more boos. There were 18 points and 12 rebounds to prove his merit, but no one will remember those. They will remember the missed free throws, the way the offense slowed to a crawl.</p>
        <p>They will not remember the third quarter, when Latrell Sprewell ran and scored, when Allan Houston popped off screens and shot. A 9-point halftime deficit was gone, Ewing having accounted for 10 of his points and 5 of his rebounds in 12 grueling minutes.</p>
        <p>Wheeling inside on Dale Davis and scoring on a layup, taking a kick-out pass from Sprewell and knocking down a baseline jumper, or making sure he kept his man off the offensive board, he was not going away -- even though most of Manhattan and some of his teammates wished he would.</p>
        <p>Privately, many Knicks players have been bantering about how they are better off without Ewing, that he holds them back from their high-octane, fuel-injected potential. Except for the occasional candor of Marcus Camby or Sprewell, they will not share the thought with reporters.</p>
        <p>But people in the locker room know it. The coach knows it, too.</p>
        <p>''I do believe some of our other players have started to let the excuse of him be an excuse for their poor play, and I think there's a real danger in that,'' Van Gundy said before the game. ''Instead of reflecting on what each individual can do better, it's now an easy out, an excuse. 'I can't do well because Pat's on the floor.'</p>
        <p>''If we lose, then it's going to be his fault and my fault for playing him,'' Van Gundy said.</p>
        <p>''No one is saying when Marcus got hurt we were better off without Marcus,'' he added. ''No one said that, but because it's Patrick, he's not that popular with you and some factions of fans.''</p>
        <p>With Ewing, people see what they want to see.</p>
        <p>So here you go, New York: This is your team without Ewing.</p>
        <p>Camby, a 7-footer with intangibles but no basics -- still unable to score with his back to the basket. Houston, getting beat backdoor by the 34-year-old Miller, trying to go one-on-one at the end as if he were Michael or Julius and not the sweet, spot-up shooter he is, the guy who needs his teammates just as much as they need him. Sprewell at warp speed, his mind unable to keep up with his body.</p>
        <p>Charlie Ward, Chris Childs and Kurt Thomas performing like All-Stars one game and disappearing in the box score the next, their hustle and brashness never a given.</p>
        <p>So often in this league, people look at what players cannot do instead of celebrating what they can. But there is no escaping their limitations without Ewing.</p>
        <p>''It's terrible how he gets treated here,'' Larry Bird said in the Pacers' locker room last night. ''Just terrible. After everything he's done for them, it's not right.''</p>
        <p>Somber as always after a loss, Ewing was asked how last night compared to other season-ending losses. ''Very disappointed,'' he said. ''I mean, well, they're all the same. Very disappointed.</p>
        <p>''I thought we worked hard,'' he added. ''We deserve to be there, but I guess it wasn't our turn again.''</p>
        <p>He was asked what he thought would happen. ''I don't know; you have to ask management that.''</p>
        <p>Ewing laid two wood-stained suit hangers next to his cubicle, looked at Mike Martinez, the team equipment manager, and said: ''If I leave these here, they'll be here next year, right? They'll be here next year, right Mike?''</p>
        <p>Martinez nodded, they would.</p>
        <p>But who knows whether Ewing and the Knicks will stay together even until next season, the way the acrimony grows daily. Who knows whether he has dragged his aching body upcourt for the final time in orange and blue. Instead of being valued for his longevity, loyalty and experience, he gets treated like a miserable relationship that should have ended years ago.</p>
        <p>When you think about it, Van Gundy is not as loyal to Ewing as he is to the tenets of the game. You have a big man with skill, you get him the ball in the low post. Ewing has only been the person most responsible for filling up the building the past 15 years.</p>
        <p>You know what question should have been asked of the coach last night: Would Ewing's harshest critics like to see the Knicks win with him or run the floor with abandon and lose without him? Soon, they will enjoy the true charm of a post-Patrick Garden.</p>
        <p>Amid the quiet of the rafters, they will all be able to afford good seats.</p>
