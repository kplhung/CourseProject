        <p>Even during the killing, it all seemed like a movie to him.</p>
        <p>On a humid night in 1989, Ke Feng watched as the scenes unfolded in the heart of Beijing. A tank smashing through a line of parked buses in Tiananmen Square. A young woman dashing toward a row of soldiers, then crumpling with a fatal shot to the head. A group of chanting students falling silent as bullets ripped into them on the Avenue of Eternal Peace.</p>
        <p>''Soldiers were pouring out from the Museum of Revolutionary History, from the Gate of Heavenly Peace,'' Mr. Ke said recently between bites of bouillabaisse in a SoHo seafood restaurant. ''This would be a great movie. I was thinking that at the time.''</p>
        <p>To those unfamiliar with Mr. Ke's history, his remarks might sound like those of a callous observer. But the Shanghai-born filmmaker, still boyish-looking at 31, was more than just a witness to the Tiananmen Square massacre, the 11th anniversary of which is tomorrow.</p>
        <p>About a week before soldiers killed hundreds of students in the early hours of June 4, Mr. Ke oversaw the construction of one of the most enduring symbols of the movement, the 27-foot statue called the Goddess of Democracy.</p>
        <p>Except for the unwanted attention of Chinese government officials, Mr. Ke and the others responsible for the statue's construction have gotten little notice. But Mr. Ke, now a graduate film student at New York University, has begun shooting interviews, collecting archival material and raising funds for a documentary to be called ''Making Goddess.''</p>
        <p>''The important thing that is not widely appreciated about him is that the Goddess of Democracy would never have been built if not for him,'' said T. D. Allman, a journalist who met Mr. Ke while covering the demonstrations for Vanity Fair. ''For one moment, his egomania and the moving fingertip of history coincided. To some extent, he has been living in the aftermath of that event ever since.''</p>
        <p>Since he fled to the United States almost 11 years ago, Mr. Ke has focused much of his creative energies on film projects about the massacre. Last year, he completed a 28-minute fiction film called ''The Official Account,'' for which he won the Directors Guild of America award for Best Asian-American Student Filmmaker. The movie tells of a Chinese television news anchor who is forced to choose between reporting or covering up the massacre.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ke said the events of Tiananmen had inspired him creatively in the same way that the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the 1960's and 70's did the filmmakers of the ''fifth generation'' movement like Zhang Yimou, Chen Kaige and Tian Zhuangzhuang.</p>
        <p>''It never occurred to me that your life could be a movie,'' Mr. Ke said, ''and that compelled a sense of mission in me.''</p>
        <p>In 1989, Mr. Ke, a political science student, was graduating from Fudan University in Shanghai when he heard about the demonstrations in Beijing. Tens of thousands of students were calling for reform of corrupt government practices. To spur protests in Shanghai, Mr. Ke and several friends built an eight-foot Styrofoam version of the Statue of Liberty.</p>
        <p>After marching it through Shanghai's main avenues, they tried taking the statue to Beijing. But when soldiers prevented them from boarding a train, Mr. Ke had to sneak on empty-handed. In Beijing, he walked straight from the station to Tiananmen Square, where thousands of students had camped out. He stumbled across a tent housing protesters from the Central Academy of Art and Design.</p>
        <p>''Ke Feng came into the tent and talked with me about the idea,'' said Bao Chao-Jun, an artist now studying computer animation in Los Angeles. ''We knew it would be the best symbol for democracy and freedom, if we built the statue there in Tiananmen Square.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bao rounded up about a dozen students from another arts academy. Using a steel frame, Styrofoam and plaster coating, they worked around the clock for three days. On May 29, the statue was taken in four parts on tricycle carts to the square, where students finished assembling it. Once standing, it faced the mammoth portrait of Mao Zedong hanging to the north of the square.</p>
        <p>Exhausted, Mr. Ke rested for several days in his girlfriend's dormitory room. But on the night of June 3, Mr. Ke said he and his girlfriend decided to camp out at the base of his ''creation'' to celebrate his 21st birthday.</p>
        <p>Hours later, soldiers marched into the square and began firing on the protesters. Mr. Ke and his girlfriend fled over stones slick with blood. ''In the movies the people triumph, but there the soldiers fired again,'' he said. ''It was the most killing I've seen in my lifetime.''</p>
        <p>The government began tracking down many Tiananmen dissidents, including those who built the statue. While some were being jailed, Mr. Ke wrote to the University of California at Berkeley explaining his role in the demonstrations. The school immediately admitted him to a graduate program in Asian studies and mailed him an airplane ticket.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ke soon dropped out of that program and earned a master's degree in political science at the University of Toronto. But filmmaking held an irresistible allure, and he enrolled in the graduate film program at New York University. He is expected to graduate this year, having completed ''The Official Account'' for his thesis film and begun laying the groundwork for ''Making Goddess.''</p>
        <p>That documentary, which is budgeted at $200,000, would take a subjective, first-person point of view, Mr. Ke said.</p>
        <p>''If my parents knew I was making this film, they would have a heart attack,'' he said. ''They think I should tell different stories. They think that in case nobody employs me in America, I can make a film in China. I'm burning a bridge if I do this.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Allman, now a close friend of Mr. Ke's, said one of the young filmmaker's greatest challenges was to move beyond the massacre as his main source material.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ke has made a few attempts: a short film he completed recently tells of a wedding photographer who falls in love with a bride-to-be. And he is writing a screenplay involving a Chinese-American tea merchant in 19th-century Boston.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ke said he would never be able to purge the killings from his memory, nor has he been able to forget his last sighting of the Goddess of Democracy. As dawn broke on June 4, Mr. Ke climbed atop a nearby billboard and gazed out over the square. Plumes of smoke rose from burning buses and tanks. In the center of the debris lay a crushed pile of styrofoam and plaster.</p>
        <p>''We were a bunch of kids at the time,'' he said. ''We didn't know about consequences. I didn't intend to be a protagonist in the story. But it ended up that I had a story with a beginning, middle and end.''</p>
