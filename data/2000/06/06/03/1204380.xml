        <p>For Marni Kuhlmann, a college student here, the choice for a recent trip home was to drive to Saskatoon -- six hours each way -- or to take an hourlong WestJet flight.</p>
        <p>''I took the plane,'' said Ms. Kuhlmann, a convert to Canada's new discount airline. ''The difference between gas and the price of the flight was $50,'' she said ($34 United States).</p>
        <p>After Air Canada's acquisition of the money-losing Canadian Airlines this spring, Canadians are waking up to an airline market more reliant on a single carrier than any other major Western nation. Air Canada has 82 percent of the market, far above the 60 percent held by Lufthansa in Germany.</p>
        <p>With passengers and lawmakers complaining that the merger has created a monopoly, the government is encouraging discount airlines. It is in this climate that WestJet Airlines is finding its niche. The fastest growing of the upstart carriers, it openly calls itself a clone of Southwest Airlines, the Dallas-based discount carrier. And it is being helped in its quest by the turmoil and bad feeling surrounding the merger of its larger rivals.</p>
        <p>Americans should take note. As the summer travel season begins, they increasingly look north of the border. Because of an open-skies agreement and a cheap dollar, Canada now rivals Britain as their most popular destination.</p>
        <p>Air Canada now flies to 54 cities in the United States, but once in Canada, vacationers may encounter packed planes and passengers grumpy over the merger.</p>
        <p>There are alternatives. WestJet, based in this western city, is marching east this year, starting flights to Hamilton, Ontario, in March; to Moncton, New Brunswick, in April; to Ottawa on June 8, and to Montreal in September. At the same time, the company has signed contracts with Boeing to double its jet fleet to 30 by the end of this decade.</p>
        <p>With the market in flux, WestJet has a natural edge, operating out of Calgary, the old headquarters for Canadian Airlines, which is to disappear in a few months. This summer, Canadian and Air Canada, now jointly controlled from Montreal, are eliminating duplicate flights, offering 25 percent fewer seats in and out of Calgary. In this environment, WestJet executives say they can pick up old passengers of Canadian, and, with low fares, draw new ones out of buses, cars and trains.</p>
        <p>Canadians do not hesitate to lash out at their big airline. ''Everything you do has been hurt, hurt, hurt, destroy, destroy, destroy,'' Lou Sekora, a member of Parliament, told Robert A. Milton, president of Air Canada, in May. Mr. Sekora is a member of the Liberal Party, whose government approved the merger.</p>
        <p>Val Meredith, of the opposition Reform Party, said Mr. Milton and Air Canada were ''the new bully on the block.'' One day in May, both national newspapers, The National Post and The Globe and Mail, printed cartoons with the same caption: ''Err Canada.''</p>
        <p>Passengers complain of overbookings, Disneyland-style lines, switched tickets, call centers with half-hour-plus waits, and prices that make it cheaper to fly to Europe than to the next province. In the Maritimes, on the east coast, some business travelers, faced with regional fares as high as 2,000 Canadian dollars, rent private planes.</p>
        <p>With the merger still being phased in, Air Canada executives say the two computer reservation systems will not be harmonized until fall. For now, they are hiring 250 new workers for the call centers and simplifying operations at Pearson International Airport in Toronto, Canada's only multi-terminal airport.</p>
        <p>''There's no problem-free way to put two companies together,'' Mr. Milton, an American, said on May 16 at Air Canada's annual meeting. ''We have to do it while the airlines are running, while we serve customers and while the media is watching. If people want to throw insults at me, throw cream pies at me, they can.''</p>
        <p>One cream pie could come from Air Canada's 2,200 pilots, who are threatening to strike as early as June 15. The last time the union went on strike, in September 1998, it shut down the airline for 13 days, wiping out a year's profits.</p>
        <p>Investors have welcomed Air Canada's near-monopoly, with the stock doubling this year, to $11.75, on the Nasdaq. But rivals complain that the mammoth new airline plays hardball. Canada 3000, a charter airline, has had several of its ground-service contracts with Canadian Airlines abruptly canceled. British Airways, Air France and Cathay Pacific have been told that Air Canada will now charge up to three times the current cost to feed passengers to their Canadian hubs. This move prompted the House of Commons to pass legislation in mid-May to guarantee that the airline would enter into ''reasonable, competitive'' arrangements when feeding passengers to international airlines. Canada's Senate is expected to approve the bill.</p>
        <p>The bill also allows the government to define ''abuse of dominant position'' and empowers the Competition Bureau, the equivalent of the Federal Trade Commission, to punish price gouging.</p>
        <p>This measure was prompted by Air Canada's attack on WestJet for moving into eastern Canada. On Feb. 29, WestJet's fourth birthday, its president, Stephen C. Smith, announced that it would start service from Moncton to Hamilton, in southern Ontario's ''golden horseshoe,'' an affluent region that includes Toronto and is home to almost a quarter of Canada's population. Service started April 19 with a walkup fare of 299 Canadian dollars.</p>
        <p>A week before WestJet's service started, Air Canada increased its capacity on its Toronto-Moncton run by 50 percent and cut its price by 75 percent, undercutting WestJet. Grilled on this in Parliament, Mr. Milton retorted, ''WestJet is now going to have to compete, but we will not behave in a predatory fashion.''</p>
        <p>The Competition Bureau's criminal division, though, has opened a formal inquiry -- a clear signal that the government wants to protect discounters from Air Canada, the world's 11th-largest airline. Last year, WestJet carried 2.3 million passengers, about a tenth of the 24.1 million carried by Air Canada and Canadian combined.</p>
        <p>''WestJet has a very significant place in the air travel mix,'' David Collenette, Canada's Transport Minister, said in an interview. ''We want to see that there are other significant competitors to Air Canada.''</p>
        <p>If Air Canada gouges the public, Mr. Collenette warned, the government will consider at the end of next year whether to allow American airlines to carry passengers between Canadian cities.</p>
        <p>In a boost for Canada 3000, the charter airline, the Government changed its rules in April to allow it to sell one-way and walkup tickets. The company announced in mid-May that it would buy four more jets.</p>
        <p>In addition, the merger legislation stipulates that if a discounter in eastern Canada starts up by September, Air Canada cannot start a discount airline until Oct. 1, 2001. Ken Rowe, a Halifax businessman, has said that in July he plans to start CanJet, a discount carrier to be based in Hamilton or Toronto.</p>
        <p>[And on Wednesday, Russell Payson, chairman of Skyservice Airlines, announced that in November he would start a discount airline aimed at business passengers. It would serve Canada's eight largest cities and Los Angeles.]</p>
        <p>But of the six discounters started in Canada in the last 20 years, only WestJet still flies.</p>
        <p>''WestJet is only the first or second successful clone of the Southwest business model,'' said Julius Maldutis, an analyst for CIBC World Markets, an investment banking company that helped WestJet go public. (The other, he said, is Ryan Air, based in Dublin.)</p>
        <p>Following Southwest's no-frills model, WestJet offers one class of seats, no meals, no frequent flier program, no airport lounges, and no tickets -- only confirmation numbers. To cut costs, it uses only one class of plane, the Boeing 737, hedges on fuel prices, uses incentives to keep employees nonunionized, and encourages ticket sales through the Internet, now about 11 percent of tickets sold. Until the expansion east, most flights were under one hour.</p>
        <p>Deferring to Canadians' sense of propriety, WestJet assigns seats, a deviation from Southwest. In return, passengers -- or ''guests,'' in WestJet-speak -- pay fares that average 40 percent below Air Canada's. On a recent day, Air Canada charged walkup travelers the equivalent of $372 for the 40-minute hop from here to Edmonton, Alberta's capital. WestJet's walkup fare was $209.</p>
        <p>''Low fares, short haul, and focus on people,'' said Mr. Smith, who formerly ran an Air Canada subsidiary, Air Ontario. Believing he is not competing directly with Air Canada, he added: ''We are putting new travelers in the skies, getting them out of their cars, off their couches.''</p>
        <p>To lift the morale of WestJet's 1,100 employees, all workers, after three months, participate in a profit-sharing plan, which produced $4 million last year. In addition, 70 percent of employees take part in a stock purchase plan, in which the company matches employee contributions up to 20 percent of salaries.</p>
        <p>The formula appears to be working. Capping four years of steady growth, WestJet's revenue passenger miles, a key indicator, were up 54 percent for the first four months of this year. In April, 78 percent of seats were filled, compared with 71 percent in April 1999. Helping to create a niche for WestJet, the combined airline controlled by Air Canada cut seats by 11 percent this spring -- slightly more than the total number of seats WestJet already offers.</p>
        <p>WestJet consistently turns a profit, while Air Canada and Canadian incurred losses in the first quarter. [WestJet shares closed yesterday at 24 Canadian dollars, up 25 cents, on the Toronto exchange.]</p>
        <p>''WestJet is tightly run, well managed, there are no flies on those guys,'' said Harry Gow, a board member of the Canadian Association of Airline Passengers, a consumer group. ''There are not many complaints.''</p>
        <p>The choice of Hamilton is a typical WestJet move. Roughly midway between Toronto and Buffalo, this airport has lower user fees than Toronto's, but comparable access to the region's 7.5 million people. With Air Canada talking about moving into Hamilton this fall or next year, WestJet supporters do not seem concerned. With about 70 employees per aircraft, half the ratio of Air Canada,  WestJet has operating costs about 40 percent lower. In past price wars, the discount carrier usually made money.</p>
        <p>''Every time Canadian matched WestJet's ticket prices, they doubled the market,'' Mr. Maldutis recalled of Canadian Airlines' losing battle in Calgary. ''But at those prices, Canadian lost money, and WestJet made money.''</p>
