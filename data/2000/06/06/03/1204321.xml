        <p>In September, an 18-year-old British girl will begin her studies at Harvard -- hardly earth-shattering news.

        <p>In September, an 18-year-old British girl will begin her studies at Harvard -- hardly earth-shattering news. Yet her fate has become a seminal event in British politics, causing nationwide debates over the philosophy of the Labor government led by Prime Minister Tony Blair and reintroducing class as a leading issue.</p>
        <p>Laura Spence, a student at a state school in northeast England, applied to study at Magdalen College, Oxford. She was turned down. She then applied to Harvard and was accepted. There the matter would have ended if the chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, had not heard about her story and declared it an ''absolute scandal'' that Oxford had denied her a place.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown used Ms. Spence's story to point to the persistence of class privilege in university admissions, particularly at Oxford and Cambridge. Among pupils with the same qualifications, applicants from private schools are 25 times more likely to gain admission to one of those two universities than those from state schools. Despite educating only 7 percent of children, private schools supplied 52 percent of all entrants to Oxford in 1999. ''It is about time we had an end to the old Britain,'' Mr. Brown said, ''where all that matters is the privileges you were born with, rather than the potential you actually have. It is time that these old universities opened their doors to women and people from all backgrounds.''</p>
        <p>William Hague, leader of the Conservative opposition (and, coincidentally, himself an Oxford graduate from a northern state school) quickly retaliated, accusing the governing Labor Party of promoting ''class war'' by raising the university issue.</p>
        <p>Britain has always had an obsession with class. Often it manifests itself in superficialities, like debate over pronunciation of the name of  Earl Spencer's stately home: Althorp (as it is spelled) or Awl-trupp (as is traditional). This time, the focus is on genuine matters of public policy.</p>
        <p>Attacking privilege has always been the philosophical underpinning of Mr. Blair's redirection of the Labor Party to a ''New Labor'' stance. Where the Labor Party of old stood for a crude redistribution of wealth, under Mr. Blair the party is seeking to make Britain a society more responsive to merit rather than privilege. And strategists have hinted that in the next election the party will proclaim itself ''on your side'' against vested interests and institutional barriers to personal advancement.</p>
        <p>But in the crucial areas of education, health and welfare, the Blair government has not pushed its arguments about merit to the point of actual policy-making. Moving more explicitly into this territory may prove a difficult political trick to pull off. Part of what made New Labor so attractive to swing voters in 1997 was that it spurned the ''Old Labor'' notions of class war and the politics of envy -- squeezing the rich ''till the pips squeak,'' as Denis Healey, a Labor minister in the 1970's put it. New Labor stood for meritocracy. But three years on, there is a palpable sense of disenchantment within the government and a feeling that Labor has failed to capitalize on the remarkable good will following its landslide victory in 1997. Hence the appeal to class resentment and the media stardom of Laura Spence.</p>
        <p>With parliamentary elections less than two years away, many of Mr. Blair's closest advisers have been urging him to show that he will indeed take on Britain's longstanding class barriers. Mr. Blair has often said in private that he would only be able to show his true mettle after a second election victory; but in order to achieve that victory, he may have to show his mettle beforehand.</p>
