        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>FORMER SENATOR SENTENCED -- Nick Wilson, once an immensely powerful Arkansas state senator who reigned for years over both houses of the General Assembly, was sentenced on Thursday to 70 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to a racketeering charge. Mr. Wilson, once known as a reformer who occasionally clashed with then Gov. Bill Clinton, was the subject of a two-year investigation by federal prosecutors, who charged him and nine others with stealing nearly $2 million from state programs. After months of denying the allegations, he was convicted of tax evasion by a federal jury last year, and then pleaded guilty to the racketeering charge in March. Mr. Wilson, 58, will also have to return the money, which was diverted from programs providing attorneys to children in child-care disputes, among others.</p>

        <p>COMPETITION FOR LUGAR -- In Indiana, David Johnson, the Democrat trying to unseat Senator Richard G. Lugar, has raised nearly $1 million, ''more money than Mr. Lugar's last two opponents combined,'' said Mr. Johnson's campaign manager, Timothy Shock. That and Mr. Johnson's background as a policy adviser to two governors, Evan Bayh (now an Indiana senator), and the current governor, Frank L. O'Bannon, has Democrats and some political analysts calling him Mr. Lugar's strongest opponent in years. ''I feel very good about where we are,'' Mr. Shock said. Lugar's going to have a real race this time.'' Still, the experts believe that Mr. Johnson, who has never run for public office before, has little chance of defeating the four-term senator, who has raised over $4 million and has $2.3 million cash on hand. ''Lugar is very well known,'' said James McCann, a political science professor at Purdue University. ''He's got a very good base. He's got name recognition no one could buy. It's definitely uphill with Johnson.''</p>

        <p>OUTRAGE OVER STRAYS -- Animal control officials in Los Angeles plan to capture and euthanize scores of stray dogs plaguing the downtown to improve the area for the Democratic National Convention in August. Many of the dogs must be put to sleep to relieve overburdened kennels, said Dan Knapp, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services. ''The challenge we're facing is severe overcrowding,'' Mr. Knapp said. Currently, nearly 1,200 dogs are up for adoption in the city's six kennels each day. Under the plan, scheduled to begin the second week of July, workers will hold for adoption only about 366 dogs each day, Mr. Knapp said. Animal rights activists voiced outrage over the plan, saying the push to reduce overcrowding is inhumane and fails to stop the abandonment of dogs in Los Angeles.</p>

        <p>OUT OF FOCUS -- Running against a popular Republican senator is no easy matter in Texas, particularly when your own party is not all that eager to help. Earlier this week Gene Kelly, the Democrat running against Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson, learned that he was not invited to the state Democratic convention next week. Molly Beth Malcolm, the chairwoman, explained the snub by saying that the party was more intent on winning statewide legislative races. But yesterday, she reversed herself, saying, ''If he shows up on Saturday and he wants to speak, we'll give him the opportunity to speak.'' But Mr. Kelly, a retired Air Force lawyer who lost six bids for statewide office in the 1990's, said no thanks anyway. ''I expect to do well on my own, and I will do well,'' he said. ''That doesn't mean I don't welcome her support.'' Support may not be the best word to describe what the party has given the 73-year-old Mr. Kelly. ''I've never met the man,'' Ms. Malcolm said. ''That race, I've said all along, is not where our focus was. It's going to be on the legislative races, so it's not a race that we're paying that much attention to.''</p>
