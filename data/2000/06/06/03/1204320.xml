        <p>With federal prosecutors set to wrap up their case next week, Albert J. Pirro Jr. suffered a setback today in his tax fraud trial when a judge rejected his attempt to exclude, or at least severely limit, the testimony of the government's key witness.</p>
        <p>Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. of United States District Court ruled that John Dennehy, an agent of the Internal Revenue Service, would be allowed, with some restrictions, to offer his expert opinion on Mr. Pirro's tax records.</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Dennehy will function as what Mr. Pirro's lawyers have described as the government's cleanup hitter, summarizing the government's contention that Mr. Pirro, Westchester County's most prominent real estate lawyer, and his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro, improperly deducted more than $1.2 million of Albert Pirro's personal expenses as business expenditures between 1988 and 1997.</p>
        <p>Given the surprises coloring the trial so far, it might have been appropriate that the ruling occurred with the jury absent. Some of the most riveting developments in the trial have occurred either in sidebar conferences, out of the earshot of the jury, or outside the courthouse itself, where Mr. Pirro and his wife, Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester district attorney, have continued to attract headlines.</p>
        <p>Today, for example, a woman who successfully sued Albert Pirro in a paternity suit appeared in court in Newark for a brief hearing to face extradition to Florida on charges of a parole violation.</p>
        <p>The woman, who has been wanted since 1995, accused of violating her parole on a 1992 grand-theft conviction, had vowed to show up at the trial here, presumably to confront Albert Pirro, possibly in front of Mrs. Pirro. But she was thwarted two days ago when she was detained by the authorities upon her arrival at Newark International Airport from her home in Scotland.</p>
        <p>The woman, who met Mr. Pirro when she worked as a paralegal in a Florida law firm, told the authorities that her name was Merri Lynn Farber.</p>
        <p>The name on the arrest warrant, though, was Lynne Lichtefeld -- her married name. In her paternity case against Mr. Pirro, her name was Jessica Marciano.</p>
        <p>What was clear, at least, was that the woman's fiance was squarely blaming Albert Pirro for her arrest, according to The Journal News, a Westchester County newspaper. But on Thursday, Mr. Pirro scoffed at that suggestion, calling it absolute nonsense, and the woman's tactics ''just theater.''</p>
        <p>So now, Ms. Lichtefeld, 45, is heading back to Florida, while Mr. Pirro, 52, braces for Week 3 of his trial.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Judge Parker is expected to sketch the basics of tax law and income-tax deductions for the jury. Then Mr. Dennehy is expected, in testimony that could take all week, to sift through Mr. Pirro's expenses, using charts and other visual aids.</p>
        <p>From the outset, the Pirro brothers have blamed each other for the tax mess, but have contended that their conduct was not criminal.</p>
        <p>If anything, Gustave H. Newman, Albert Pirro's lead lawyer, has argued that his client was simply too busy: a big-time businessman and Republican lobbyist with too many ''irons in the fire'' to bother with mundane bookkeeping details. And besides, Albert Pirro repaid the government his back taxes, and then some.</p>
        <p>What is really happening, Albert Pirro has said, is that federal prosecutors are intent on embarrassing his wife, who has been mentioned as a potential candidate for governor or the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pirro has not been charged with wrongdoing, but she has clearly been singed by some of the testimony from contractors and associates detailing her family's expenses and predilection for mixing business with politics.</p>
        <p>So on Thursday -- once again, outside the courtroom -- a clearly frustrated Mr. Pirro complained about the news media's focus on the paternity suit and on his family's private life, which he said was now exposed ''for all the geeks out there, trying to look in our lives.''</p>
        <p>He also complained that news reports had largely ignored testimony from his personal assistant that one of his corporate tax returns was signed by his former bookkeeper, and that one of his personal tax returns omitted his daughter with Mrs. Pirro -- an oversight that he said supported his contention that he simply did not pay close attention to details.</p>
        <p>''There is no tax case here,'' he said. ''This is character assassination.''</p>
