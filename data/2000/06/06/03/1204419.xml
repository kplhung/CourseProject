        <p>Stars May Change Tactics</p>
        <p>Although the Stars lead the series, Dallas Coach Ken Hitchcock hinted there might be significant changes for Game 3.</p>
        <p>''Without letting the cat out of the bag, this is the first time in three and a half years that we've had to make some significant adjustments to our team game,'' said Hitchcock, whose Stars trapped their way to the Stanley Cup championship last season. ''We're playing against a team that has an attitude about themselves that's very steely and defined. We've had to change our ways. We've always been a team that's played the game in a very north-south manner. We've attacked very aggressively up the ice and we've had to be a lot more patient with our play now, playing this type of team, because they're very determined.''</p>
        <p>Lowe is Oilers' Top Choice</p>
        <p>Kevin Lowe remains the Oilers' first choice to replace Glen Sather as Edmonton's general manager. Lowe is also believed to be Sather's first choice to become his new coach with the Rangers. Lowe is scheduled to meet again with the Edmonton ownership group on Tuesday.</p>
