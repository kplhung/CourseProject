        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''In Online Auction World, Hoaxes Aren't Easy to See'' (front page, June 2):</p>
        <p>Your article makes it sound as if shill bidding is unique to online auctions and never happens in face-to-face auctions.</p>
        <p>But shill bidding has been going on since auctions began, and it has never been easy to detect. Does it really make a difference? To those who feel duped, I can only ask, Why? Was anyone forcing them to bid?</p>
        <p>If people are foolish enough to spend large sums buying items from near-anonymous sellers, then perhaps they deserve what they get. It seems that people who take part in Internet auctions are looking for big  gains, just as others do when they invest in the stock market.</p>
