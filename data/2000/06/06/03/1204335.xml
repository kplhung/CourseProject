        <p>Sign of a Slowdown  The Labor Department said the nation's private employers, instead of hiring, shed 116,000 jobs in May. It was the largest drop in more than eight years and the first since the economy began to soar in the mid-1990's. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.1 percent from 3.9 percent. Wage increases eased, reducing concerns about inflation. Investors pushed stocks up across the board in the belief that the evidence would discourage or limit further interest rate increases by the Fed.</p>
