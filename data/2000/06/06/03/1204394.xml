        <p>The Liberty will seek its first Women's National Basketball Association victory of the season today when it plays the Utah Starzz at Madison Square Garden. The team is struggling to overcome injuries to key players and last-minute changes in a lineup that appears to be growing younger by the day.</p>
        <p>Crystal Robinson, the team's clutch 3-point shooter, severely sprained her left ankle in Wednesday's game against the Mercury and is expected to be out for two weeks. Richie Adubato, the Liberty coach, plans to use the 6-foot-2-inch rookie Shea Mahoney at the starting forward spot. Last night the Liberty waived Venus Lacy, the 6-4 veteran center, and reacquired Desiree Francis, a 6-1 second-round draft pick who was waived during the first week of training camp.</p>
