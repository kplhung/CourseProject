      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The last two weeks have been wondrous for Lewis Katz, the principal owner of the Nets. First, he received a last-minute phone call from his son, Drew, encouraging him to change his mind about not attending the National Basketball Association draft lottery and sitting on the dais. And sure enough, with Katz representing them, the Nets received the first pick, defying 4 in 100 odds.</p>
        <p>Then on Monday, Katz received a call from Rod Thorn, the league's executive vice president for basketball operations. Thorn, whom Katz had attempted to woo into the organization last summer, asked if the Nets had decided on a president. If they had not, Thorn said, he wanted the job. Yesterday, Thorn was announced as the Nets' president, receiving a deal that is believed to be worth about $12.5 million over five years.</p>

        <p>This is a major acquisition for us, akin to a first draft choice, Katz said, linking his recent coups together. We have Rod. We have the pick. We have Stephon Marbury.</p>
