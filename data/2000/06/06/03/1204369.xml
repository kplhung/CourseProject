        <p>Five months after German industry and the government agreed to pay Holocaust survivors nearly $5 billion, the deal became ensnarled today in disagreements with the United States over protecting the companies from future lawsuits.</p>
        <p>As a result, German and American officials warned that the aging population of Nazi-era slave laborers and forced laborers might have to wait until next year before receiving any payments.</p>
        <p>After almost 14 hours of talks on Thursday night and this morning, American and German negotiators failed to reach agreement and gave up their hope that President Clinton would be able to sign the final pact this weekend during his visit with European leaders in Berlin.</p>
        <p>American and German negotiators said they were still confident of reaching a final deal, and they scheduled another round of talks in Washington on June 12.</p>
        <p>''We must agree on final arrangements by then,'' said Otto Lambsdorff, a former German economics minister who is his country's lead negotiator on the matter. ''If we don't get the whole thing going, then the million or so survivors will have to wait even longer for the payments.''</p>
        <p>What has surprised many observers, including groups representing Holocaust survivors, is that the dispute has erupted now over an issue that appeared to have been settled last December.</p>
        <p>The main dispute is over German demands for ''legal closure,'' a guarantee from the United States government that German companies will be shielded from any future American lawsuits stemming from their activities during Hitler's Third Reich.</p>
        <p>Under the basic plan, German industry and the German government would each contribute 5 billion marks ($2.4 billion at the current exchange rate) to the new fund, which would then make payments to Holocaust-era victims including slaves, who were kept in concentration camps, and forced laborers, who worked against their will but received better treatment and some pay.</p>
        <p>But German corporations have insisted on receiving immunity from future lawsuits over claims for compensation -- a guarantee that the fund will resolve all such claims once and for all.</p>
        <p>The issue is crucial because a primary motive of the corporations in agreeing to create the fund was that they faced an explosion of class-action lawsuits filed in American courts on behalf of millions of people around the world.</p>
        <p>American officials, led by Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart E. Eizenstat, agree in principle but say the American government does not have the power to simply bar future lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Last December the two sides appeared to have agreed on a workable compromise: the American government would file a strongly worded legal brief that would be used to urge judges to reject any future Holocaust claims on the ground that they had been addressed by the new fund.</p>
        <p>But German officials said today that the proposed American brief was not strong enough, because it rested largely on American ''foreign policy interests'' in rejecting future lawsuits.</p>
        <p>''If it is only a political statement, then there is a risk that a judge five years from now will have lost the context of what happened here,'' said Wolfgang Gibowski, a spokesman for German industry. ''We need legal wording, to explain that there are not only political reasons but legal reasons to dismiss the case.''</p>
        <p>Making matters more difficult, Mr. Lambsdorff has raised only 2.4 billion of the 5 billion marks that has been pledged from German corporations. Hundreds of smaller companies that did business during the Nazi period are resisting calls to join the fund, and some companies are now threatening to withdraw their pledges if they are not guaranteed legal immunity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lambsdorff has harshly criticized the German corporate holdouts and recently accused them of using the issue of legal immunity as a ''lazy pretext'' for not contributing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lambsdorff and Mr. Eizenstat hoped to work out a final agreement in time for President Clinton and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder to sign here this weekend.</p>
        <p>Gideon Taylor, head of the Jewish Claims Conference in New York, said today that he remained optimistic.</p>
        <p>''I would hope that both sides remember what is at stake here, and I think they will,'' Mr. Taylor said in a telephone interview.</p>
