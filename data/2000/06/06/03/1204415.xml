        <p>Seilala Sua of U.C.L.A. won her second straight shot-put title tonight at the National Collegiate Athletic Association outdoor track and field championships in Durham, N.C., and ended her collegiate career with a total of seven N.C.A.A. titles.</p>
        <p>The 5-foot-11-inch, 245-pound Sua, who won her fourth straight discus throw title on Thursday, took the shot with her first put, 56 feet 11inches, which gave her a foot-and-a-half margin over the runner-up, Cheree Hicks of Syracuse.</p>
        <p>Sua, who won this year's indoor shot put, is surpassed in total college titles only by Suzy Favor Hamilton, the former middle-distance runner, who had nine at Wisconsin in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Southern California, returning to national prominence after more than two decades out of the spotlight, swept both 400-meter hurdles races. Felix Sanchez won the men's race, charging past Bayano Kamani of Baylor, the defending champion. Their times, 48.41 and 48.43 seconds, are the fastest by Americans this year.</p>
        <p>Natasha Danvers won the women's 400 hurdles for Southern Cal, beating Tanya Jarrett by 13 feet in 55.26. Southern California also took the women's 400-meter relay, as Angela Williams outleaned Louisiana State's Peta-Gaye Dowdie at the finish line and won, 43.14 to 43.16 seconds.</p>
        <p>The men's 800 was won by Patrick Nduwimana of Arizona, who held off the charge of Missouri's Derrick Peterson by a meter in a fast 1:45.08. Last year Peterson won, overtaking Nduwimana in the final 20 yards.</p>
