        <p>In recent years, the craggy peaks and sharp precipices of the common stock chart have redefined the American landscape. Charts flash on television screens and computer monitors, inspire animated debate and wild expectations, and become minor obsessions. Anyone who follows charts cannot follow them casually; too much is at stake. But anyone who follows them closely can be baffled by their vast swings, unexplained moves and dizzying plunges.</p>
        <p>Of course, professional commentators would argue, these movements are hardly arbitrary. Among the reasons they offer for the ups and downs: changes in interest rates, shifts in foreign policy, technological innovations. And theories abound for how to predict the fate of a company's stock chart.</p>
        <p>Some investors have championed ''value'' investing, in which a company's cash flow, future earnings and assets are rigorously analyzed; stock prices are expected to reflect a rational analysis of value.</p>
        <p>One interpretation of stock market behavior, known as the random walk theory, has less faith in reason: prices randomly stumble around a perceived value like a drunk looking for a lost coin; no past price can tell us anything about the future.</p>
        <p>Other theories argue that the future can indeed be anticipated by examining past activity through computer analyses of the rate of stock sales, or calculations of the averages of stock prices over the last 200 days, or examinations of seasonal price patterns.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, though, another set of techniques appeals to the hope that a deeper order can be revealed in the bewildering movements of the market. It is known as ''technical analysis.'' As the Internet has turned the market into a mass market, this discipline, once the domain of professional traders, has entered the mainstream.</p>
        <p>Software programs like Omnitrader and Internet sites like www.barchart.com bring the approach home. Television discussions of ''support levels,'' and ''consolidation,'' ''breakouts'' and ''corrections,'' have made the vocabulary as familiar as a weatherman's references to low-pressure systems, pollen count and wind-chill factors.</p>
        <p>According to the theory of technical analysis, nothing needs to be considered aside from a chart showing price movements and volumes of trades. Forget profit statements, business plans and inflation figures; ignore whether the company makes widgets or lays fiber optic cable. Investors, the theory believes, have already come in contact with all these bits of knowledge, reacted to them, judged their impact on other investors, and acted upon them. The result is a stock's price; commitment to that price is measured in the volume of trades.</p>
        <p>Technical analysts examine charts, draw geometric shapes, connect points and mark off familiar patterns. Each pattern has a meaning in the analyst's lexicon, providing a glimpse of what might happen next. Some technical analysts, having seen a promise of pictorial order, go further, arguing that there are even more basic rules governing these shapes, rules that grow out of what they consider basic laws of nature and geometry; some get even more fantastical, invoking the principles of astrology. These latter hypotheses do not seem to have a major following, but few traders work without using some of the techniques of technical analysis.</p>
        <p>In one classic text, ''Technical Analysis of Stock Trends,'' (seventh edition, 1997, St. Lucie Press), Robert D. Edwards and John Magee trace technical analysis to ideas first advanced a hundred years ago by Charles H. Dow, a founder of Dow Jones &amp; Company. The market, they explain, moves in long-term trends in which stocks rise or fall; those trends are subdivided into secondary or tertiary trends in which retreats and advances also take place.</p>
        <p>The entire effect, they suggest, is like the ebb and flow of the tides, punctuated by individual waves washing against the shore, whose own surfaces are, in turn, shaped by more chaotic ripples. The goal of analysis is to identify places where the tide will change.</p>
        <p>Charts can help, analysts argue, if their pictorial language is properly understood. These patterns tend to have geometric names like a ''right-angle broadening formation'' or pictorial names like ''falling wedge.'' A chart might, for example, create a ''head and shoulders formation,'' which is composed of three jagged hills, the central one (the head) reaching the highest point. These patterns and scores of others can best be understood as maps of human behavior, revealing ways in which investors act and react.</p>
        <p>Consider one example: the ''head and shoulders'' pattern. When a stock's price is rising, analysts argue, the pattern is almost always followed by a reversal. Why? Imagine a stock moving from $10 to $12 and back, forming a ''shoulder.'' It then rises again to $15 before falling again to $10, forming a ''head.'' Finally another shoulder forms, resembling the first. Why should this mean the stock will fall from $10?</p>
        <p>Well, think of the behavior this pattern portrays. The first rise is energetic, with heavy volume, but the fall back from $12 reveals some doubts. Some owners cautiously sell off a bit, but others may hold on as the first shoulder is formed. The head represents yet another burst of support. But though the stock reaches higher, the trading has less volume. Conviction is limited and the stock drops again.</p>
        <p>Two such rises and falls might be thought inconsequential, but by the time the stock rises yet again, worry becomes palpable. The faith in the stock cannot be supported. Finally, the stock begins its extended fall, plunging below $10, which is picturesquely called the ''neckline.''</p>
        <p>The uncertainty shown in this pattern might be affected by a company's fortunes, or the state of the economy, but according to the theory, interpreting the pattern requires no knowledge of any of this. ''Head and shoulders'' is a pattern caused by conflict; it reveals a gradual defeat of bullish optimism. And the pattern has the same meanings for any stock.</p>
        <p>The theory of analysis then goes even further: rules not only predict broad patterns, they also provide guidance about the extent of a rise or fall. For analysts, charts almost seem to follow aesthetic principles.  For example, analysts suggest that in the ''head and shoulders'' pattern, the second shoulder will tend to mirror the first, and the rise of the ''head'' will tend to be matched by the extent of the fall after the stock drops below the ''neckline.'' There is something uncanny about such assertions; they are much more difficult to justify. But they reveal a determination to find order in the midst of seeming chaos.</p>
        <p>Critics argue that these sorts of rules have so many exceptions they can hardly be relied upon; that patterns are best seen in retrospect,  when they are no longer helpful; that analysts' ideas can becomeself-fulfilling prophecies. And indeed, while investment banks have technical analysts on staff, strict analysis is generally tempered by considerations of other factors.</p>
        <p>But the effort to find pictorial order seems almost universal. The Japanese, for example, have used a 300-year-old method of charting known as ''candlesticks,'' made familiar in the West after the analyst Steve Nison examined them in books like ''Beyond Candlesticks: New Japanese Charting Techniques Revealed'' (1994, Wiley). Instead of just marking the range of a day's trading with a single vertical line, as on Western charts, the Japanese create candlesticks: small rectangles whose ends represent the stock's opening and closing prices. If the price fell during the day, the candlestick is darkened (and is called a ''long black body''); if the price rose,  it is left unshaded (and is called a ''long white body''). In candlestick charts, technical analysis becomes almost poetic, with patterns named ''morning star,'' ''hanging man'' and ''falling window.''</p>
        <p>But if charts reveal hidden patterns, some believe there are even deeper esoteric patterns guiding them. In ''The Psychology of Technical Analysis'' (1993, Irwin), which The Financial Times of London said would ''entertain and intrigue keen investors,'' Tony Plummer, a British trader, argues that the ebb and flow of human activity actually follow a pattern that resembles the curve of the Nautilus shell. That curve, which expands outward without changing its shape, recurs throughout the natural world in various organic forms (pine cones, sunflowers, tree leaves). It is an image of a certain form of growth that, Mr. Plummer suggests, also applies to the large-scale actions of the marketplace. He argues that a properly drawn Nautilus curve -- and it is by no means easy to find the proper curve -- will intersect with the stock's highs and lows.</p>
        <p>Major turning points in stock charts, other theorists have also argued, occur at intervals determined by the Golden Mean -- a ratio approximately equal to 1.618 that also determines the shape of the Nautilus curve. Similar arguments are made in ''Fibonacci Applications and Strategies for Traders'' by Robert Fischer (1993, Wiley) and are regularly described in survey texts like ''Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets'' by John J. Murphy (1999, New York Institute of Finance). The quest for order would now seem complete: charts not only are rife with symmetries and patterns, but they also reflect a ratio that is considered one of the most beautiful in the natural world.</p>
        <p>It is perhaps too much to believe, that the cumulative effect of individual decisions to buy and sell would create such hidden patterns. In fact, push the notion of hidden pattern a bit further and chart reading can even turn religious: the analyst Perry J. Kaufman devotes 10 pages to financial astrology in a scrupulous theoretical text, ''Trading Systems and Methods'' (1998, Wiley), a method few analysts would probably confess to using.</p>
        <p>Of course, these assertions are not widely accepted; they are extensions of the theory, not exceptions to it. Technical analysis has its believers and detractors, but it is an unusual attempt to make sense of an exceedingly mysterious phenomenon.</p>
        <p>After all, the market may be created by its participants but it is also independent of them; it reflects their will but also affects their will; its participants believe they are free, but their actions fall into familiar patterns. The chart is not just the record of a company's share price; it is the record of attempts to guess the future. It is a trace of human behavior. So what are we seeing when we examine these charts? Images of ourselves.</p>
