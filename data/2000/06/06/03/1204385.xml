        <p>REGGIE Miller, the reluctant New Yorker and Mark Jackson, the native New Yorker, sat down late last night, faced reporters and attempted to put into words how years of frustration, futile endings, upsets, trying and failing to reach the National Basketball Association finals, had finally ended. Indiana had broken through, on, of all places, the enemy's court.</p>
        <p>''I really wouldn't be doing any justice to try to put it in words,'' Jackson said.</p>
        <p>Miller spoke about the pregame pep talk he gave his Pacer teammates before they took the floor last night. How he told them if he had a choice of where to win a championship and against what team, ''I would choose this building and this team.''</p>
        <p>The only one who truly understood how the two players felt was across the hall icing his knees and his bruised dreams. One Patrick Aloysius Ewing, the Knicks' 37-year-old center,  saw Miller snuff out New York's hopes with clutch 3-point shooting that caught Knicks fans -- and maybe even the Knicks -- by surprise.</p>
        <p>Miller finished with a game-high 34 points: he attempted 19 field goals and made 10; he attempted seven 3-pointers, made 5. Miller buried the Knicks. His three fourth-quarter 3-pointers accomplished something that no other team -- no other player -- had accomplished during this year's playoffs. Those shots took the Knicks' will. Miller revived his imprimatur as the Knick-killer. He ended a season and may well have ended a Knicks era.</p>
        <p>Miller's long, frustrating quest for a championship -- so similar to Jackson's quest and Ewing's, too -- was now within reach.</p>
        <p>And this time, once the Pacers' 93-80 victory was complete, there was no boastful talking by Miller, no gestures. Just a celebration on the court where his play had declared a devastating truth to New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>''We talked a lot of stuff about what we were going to do,'' Miller conceded, when asked about the post-game rejoicing. ''But New York was gracious to us last year after they upset us. There was no need to rub it in.</p>
        <p>''I may use the word 'hate' or 'dislike,' '' Miller added in discussing his feelings about the Knicks and New York. ''But I need that fire; last year I didn't have it. I didn't talk; that killed my aggressiveness. You have to have someone to hate. Last year, I didn't hate New York. To be honest, I thought it was going to be easy.''</p>
        <p>And Miller, his victory over New York complete, added a final thought -- that the three people that New Yorkers hate the most are  ''John Rocker, Michael Jordan and myself.''</p>
        <p>Miller typically gives himself too much credit, but last night was his night. He made his points, and proved a point. In a matter fit for a sage, Miller provided New Yorkers with the answer to a riddle they been debating for nearly  two weeks: Who should we despise? Who is the secret culprit sabotaging the Knicks, keeping them from a championship for nearly three decades? This year, the first-round series with Toronto was framed as a matchup between the Knicks and a young Toronto star, Vince Carter. The second-round series with Miami was cast as the Knicks against a granite Heat defense.</p>
        <p>But this Indiana series became an exercise in psychoanalysis in which the Knicks were being engaged mostly in a battle with themselves. The challenge was to find the inner enemy.</p>
        <p>And Ewing became it. Until last night, much of the focus of Knicks fans in this series was divided along the lines of those who liked Patrick, those who didn't and those who liked him but felt he should not play against the Pacers.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Miller, who once drew the scorn of New Yorkers, was more or less dismissed, almost as a parody of himself. He was through, at least against the Knicks. Last season, when the Pacers went down in six games to New York, even Larry Bird questioned him, wondered why a star would not want the ball in clutch time. He was no longer the big, bad wolf who once taunted Spike Lee, who grabbed his throat to indicate the Knicks had choked. Who scored 8 points in the final seconds to steal a playoff game from the Knicks.</p>
        <p>Until the fourth quarter of last night's game. Midway through the quarter, the Knicks cut the Indiana lead to 72-68. On a switch that found Charlie Ward on Miller, Ward scraped, fought and knocked the ball out of bounds. The Garden crowd cheered the effort. This was one of those cheers when the crowd smells a comeback.</p>
        <p>But Miller, now with Latrell Spreewell looking down his throat, simply stepped back and hit a clean, smooth 3-pointer.</p>
        <p>Miller had made his point and given the answer to the Knicks' riddle. The problem is not internal. The problem is not Ewing. The one to hate is the one you have hated -- Reggie Miller.</p>
