        <p>Describing absent fathers as ''the No. 1 cause of child poverty in America,'' Vice President Al Gore called today for measures to encourage them to pay child support.</p>
        <p>''As president, I will launch a second generation of welfare reform to require all fathers who owe child support to pay up or be required to go to work to support their children,'' Mr. Gore said at a conference on fatherhood. ''We've been requiring that of the mothers; let's require it of the fathers.''</p>

        <p>Describing absent fathers as ''the No. 1 cause of child poverty in America,'' Vice President Al Gore called today for measures to encourage them to pay child support.</p>
        <p>''As president, I will launch a second generation of welfare reform to require all fathers who owe child support to pay up or be required to go to work to support their children,'' Mr. Gore said at a conference on fatherhood. ''We've been requiring that of the mothers; let's require it of the fathers.''</p>
        <p>Citing statistics showing that children in single-parent families are more likely to be poor, to drop out of school, to go to jail or to commit suicide, Mr. Gore also called for government policies that would ''lift up the institution of marriage.''</p>
        <p>''Governments don't raise children, and national policies can never take a child to a baseball game,'' the vice president said. ''But I believe we have a national obligation to insist upon responsible fatherhood.''</p>
        <p>As part of his plan, Mr. Gore proposed ''parental responsibility accounts'' for families on welfare. Most child support intended for families on welfare goes instead to state governments, which use the money to defer the cost of benefits.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Gore's proposal, some of those payments would go into accounts that would become available to families when they went off welfare. Mr. Gore said that more parents would pay child support if they knew it would go to their families instead of the government. He said it would cost the federal government $2.3 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>The vice president also proposed federal grants for states that created successful programs for finding work for unemployed parents who owed child support. And he called for policies that would make it easier for credit card companies to deny new credit cards to parents who were delinquent in child support payments.</p>
        <p>To help two-parent families stay together, Mr. Gore called for changing the tax code so that working couples would not pay higher taxes than if they filed as individuals. Under his plan, he would eliminate that so-called marriage penalty only for families that used the standard deduction.</p>
        <p>Republicans criticized Mr. Gore's tax plan, saying it would reduce taxes for 9 million of the 28 million couples who filed tax returns. A Republican plan supported by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican presidential nominee, would eliminate the penalty for all the couples.</p>
        <p>''Put George Bush in the White House and the marriage penalty will be gone,'' said Chris Paulitz, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ''Al Gore will not fight for this. He will give Americans lip service, but not fight.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore ran into some trouble with his audience. When the vice president said that only one in four parents who owe child support actually pay it, a man in the audience shouted, ''That's a lie.''</p>
        <p>''Is he on the speaking program today?'' Mr. Gore shot back with a sly smile to the rest of the mostly friendly crowd.</p>
        <p>In keeping with the upbeat tone of all his events this week, Mr. Gore added confessional touches to his remarks today, part of his effort to underscore his biography and soften his image. Mostly, those touches were about his late father, Albert, a Democratic senator from Tennessee.</p>
        <p>''I remember watching my father bait a hook on the banks of the Caney Fork River and sit quietly for an hour,'' Mr. Gore said. ''From such moments sons learn more from their dads about patience, joy, duty and love than they do from all of the lectures and sermons that you can add up.''</p>
