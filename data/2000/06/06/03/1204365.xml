        <p>PAT RILEY would have strained his mousse. Reggie Miller would have had conniptions. The Atlanta Braves prefer to think of it as money in the bank.</p>
        <p>All those ''NY'' caps strutting around the ballpark with large, hard New York heads underneath were demographics on parade.</p>
        <p>There were transplanted New Yorkers, homesick New Yorkers, lifetime New Yorkers, truculent New Yorkers, even some wannabe New Yorkers, all of them wearing the dreaded dark-blue insignia that has been branded into the troubled minds of Braves fans since the 1996 and 1999 World Series.</p>
        <p>There was a roar when Ricky Ledee lofted a three-run homer in the fourth inning that helped the Yanks beat the Braves, 5-2. The home fans cheered even louder when Andruw Jones made a running, fully-extended catch to rob Paul O'Neill of extra bases in the seventh, but there was not that great a disparity between the 90 percent Braves and the 10 percent Yankees in the crowd.</p>
        <p>Several thousand Yankee fans had come up with tickets for the first interleague game of the season between the two World Series teams of last year. How long ago that seems, back when John Rocker was just a loutish relief pitcher with rabbit ears, before he became a household name for his ugly comments about the diverse types on the New York City streets and subways.</p>
        <p>''I can't wait for him to go to New York,'' said Steve Proper, now from Buckhead, but originally from Meadville, Pa., who was wearing his NY cap. ''It's going to be nasty.''</p>
        <p>The mood was not nearly as intense as it was during last year's World Series, when legions of Yankee fans marauded around Turner Field, showing their Yankee emblems and their gall in equal proportion. They were erstwhile Spike Lees, showing their stuff in the rival arena, just as the Spikester does in his lightning raids to Miami and to Indiana during the basketball playoffs, now ended in New York.</p>
        <p>By popping up like Bugs Bunny with orange Knicks paraphernalia draped all over him, Spike has annoyed resident Elmer Fudds in Miami and Indiana. Riley and Miller have urged local fans to show patriotism and gobble up those tickets before ubiquitous New Yorkers get their evil hands on them.</p>
        <p>Of course, it is nothing new for New Yorkers to swarm to sports events in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''When the Knicks come down here, the crowd is half New Yorkers,'' said Carl Liddelow, now working in Atlanta but originally from Manhattan. ''The Giants play here this season. I can hardly wait to see what happens.''</p>
        <p>Lee, who was born in Georgia and attended Morehouse College, has returned for Knicks games, but the combined Braves-Hawks management finally had to draw the line.</p>
        <p>''Spike called me before one game and said he needed to sit in the front row,'' recalled Stan Kasten, the president of both clubs. ''I said it was not in my best interests to help him be in the front row. So he found somebody and got in the second row.''</p>
        <p>Baseball being a more democratic sport, it was much easier for New York types to get into Turner Field last night.</p>
        <p>''I got on the phone the first day tickets went on sale,'' said Phil Mentnech from Charleston, S.C., originally from the Catskills, who was seated down the right-field line. ''This was the best I could do after three hours.''</p>
        <p>The Yankee fans admitted they were not pummeled or taunted, the way the occasional foolhardy Braves or Red Sox fan is bullied in Shea or Yankee Stadium. But Kasten would not concede that New York has a monopoly on viciousness.</p>
        <p>''Ninety-nine percent of the fans are fine,'' Kasten said. ''But you have to draw the line. There are things your neighbors and the players have the right not to hear. There is a form of assault, not battery, and we will throw people out if they cross that line.''</p>
        <p>Rocker was not making it up when he accused Shea Stadium fans of shouting vile things at the Braves. His problem was that he made some weird link between the small proportion of ugly Shea fans with assorted ethnic and racial and social groups in New York.</p>
        <p>After his bigoted feelings hit print in Sports Illustrated during the off-season, he was suspended for two weeks. The team was barely putting up with him this spring even before his earned run average soared to 4.41. Asked if Rocker was still his stopper, Bobby Cox said slowly, ''Yeah, sure, I guess,'' which told it all.</p>
        <p>Last night a feisty minority of New Yorkers reminded Rocker there are more where they came from.</p>
