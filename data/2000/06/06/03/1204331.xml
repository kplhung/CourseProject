        <p>After a disappointing outing in the most recent America's Cup match in Auckland, New Zealand, and after months of conjecture about a future role in the event, the New York Yacht Club announced that it would field a challenge to the next Kiwi defense of the cup, in 2002-3.</p>
        <p>And the club will do so under the command of a surprising ally: the four-time cup winner, Dennis Conner.</p>
        <p>Though Conner has enjoyed vast success in the cup wars, he was the New York skipper in 1983 when the cup was lost for the first time in 132 years of the Manhattan club's stewardship.</p>
        <p>That defeat led to a period of outright hostility between Conner and a segment of the club's membership, some of whom -- perhaps jokingly -- called for Conner's head to replace the vacated trophy at club headquarters on West 44th Street.</p>
        <p>''If you go back and read some of the comments that went back and forth, it's pretty ironic,'' the club's commodore, George M. Isdale Jr., said. ''Now we'll see if we can win it back with the guy who lost it for us. Oh yeah, we'll give him his head back now.''</p>
        <p>Conner, who is racing in Italy, was unavailable for comment. But Bill Trenkle, general manager of Conner's Stars and Stripes syndicate, which will represent New York in 2002-3, said: ''This is something a lot of people wanted to see happen. For Dennis, it really brings it full circle.''</p>
        <p>Conner's 1983 loss came in the waters off Newport, R.I., the cup site since 1930. But in keeping with the theme of surprise, Isdale said that if the club was successful in regaining the cup they would consider staging the defense in New York Harbor.</p>
        <p>''The venue will be very important,'' Isdale said. ''We saw how successful financially the whole cup operation was in the restructuring of Auckland. Just think, in New York City we have three times as many people as the Kiwis have in their whole country.''</p>
        <p>In the last cup, New York's two-boat Young America squad failed to advance past the preliminary challenger trials. Conner's one-boat program, with Ken Read at the helm, made it as far as the semifinals. Tom Whidden, the Stars and Stripes tactician, has already signed on for the next campaign. Read confirmed that he planned to be aboard, too. ''As far as I'm concerned, it's a dream come true,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As for the rest of Conner's sailing team, Trenkle said that most of the core crew would also return.</p>
        <p>Though Isdale would not divulge details of the financial arrangement between Conner and the club, he did acknowledge that the deal was laden with incentives.</p>
        <p>''It's not the structure that everyone thinks Dennis works on, where he gets a cut of everything,'' he said. ''He's gambling here. He doesn't get paid upfront. To make real money, he has to win.''</p>
