        <p>Letter from Prof Robert Lapides (Borough of Manhattan Community College) deplores CUNY trustees' determination to serve the needs of New York's business class instead of trying to educate the 'whole people' (May 28 article)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The ''intramural warfare'' at the City University of New York (editorial, May 28) can largely be explained by the board of trustees' determination to serve the needs of the city's business class. Instead of trying to educate the ''whole people,'' as our original mission stated, the board has taken steps to narrow admissions.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The ''intramural warfare'' at the City University of New York (editorial, May 28) can largely be explained by the board of trustees' determination to serve the needs of the city's business class. Instead of trying to educate the ''whole people,'' as our original mission stated, the board has taken steps to narrow admissions.</p>
        <p>Rather than trying to educate the whole person, the board is moving toward an emphasis on vocational training. Choosing to ignore the expertise of the faculty and the right of our elected representatives to be appropriately consulted, the board treats us with contempt. No wonder there is discontent.</p>
        <p>ROBERT LAPIDES  New York, May 29, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of English at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, CUNY.</p>
