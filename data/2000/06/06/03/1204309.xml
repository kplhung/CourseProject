        <p>Danette Conroy was upstairs cleaning kitchen cabinets and her year-old daughter Kayleigh was asleep when the black bear somehow got into the ground floor of their new home. They never heard a thing until the crash of breaking glass. The bear, apparently startled by the arrival of Mrs. Conroy's husband, Chris, had plunged through a double-paned window and stumbled away toward the woods.</p>
        <p>''I've lived in Stillwater since I was age 4, and now I'm 41,'' said Mr. Conroy, a hunter, recalling what happened last summer. ''I've never ever, ever seen a bear until about five years ago.''</p>
        <p>These days, everybody in this township of 4,500 on the slopes of the Kittatinny Mountains of northwestern New Jersey seems to know somebody with a bear story. Charlie McMahon raised goats as a hobby for 15 years until a bear killed two of them three years ago. Just two weeks ago, at a Boy Scout camp in nearby Allamuchy, a bear yanked a sleeping bag -- with a teenage scout inside it -- off a bench; the youth, who was uninjured, screamed and frightened off the bear.</p>
        <p>And last summer, a bear broke up Diane Apostola's backyard barbecue for 20 relatives. ''He just came walking down like he was coming to the party with us,'' Ms. Apostola said. ''We all ran into the house, and he just left.''</p>
        <p>As the numbers of black bears and people have grown in  forested areas of the New York region, the bears -- once timid and content with isolated lives in the woods -- are venturing more and more into campgrounds, yards and even houses in search of food. The place where their wanderings  have caused the biggest stir is New Jersey; the State Division of Fish and Wildlife said it received 1,659 complaints about bears last year, up from 285 in 1995.</p>
        <p>Most of the complaints were about bears roaming in backyards and getting into garbage and bird feeders, but 28 of them involved bears killing livestock and 29 were about bears getting into homes. Although none of the complaints involved bears' attacking or injuring people, the intrusions have imposed anxieties and restrictions on life in this wooded corner of the state.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey Fish and Game Council will hold a public hearing Tuesday in Lawrenceville on its proposal to allow bear hunting this fall for the first time in 30 years. The council wants to reduce the state's bear population, now estimated at 1,000, to between 250 and 330 in the next three years in order to cut down on encounters between people and bears.</p>
        <p>''We see this as a safety issue,'' said John W. Bradway, chairman of the council. ''Some people fear for their children's safety. They're afraid to let kids out in the yard.''</p>
        <p>The hunting proposal, made last March, is opposed by 22 animal rights groups that want the state to do more to teach people to coexist with bears.</p>
        <p>''There's no overpopulation problem,'' said Lynda Smith, director of one such group, the Bear Education and Resource Group of West Milford, N.J. ''The state's making things sound worse than they are. If we cut off food in the neighborhoods, the bears won't come in.''</p>
        <p>But the animals have a keen sense of smell that can penetrate even the strongest barriers to food. Two summers ago, a black bear broke into Carolyn and Michael Ganon's home here by yanking an air-conditioner out of a window and crawling in through the hole -- apparently seeking an uncovered canister of toffee in the family room. Terrified, the couple's son, Leland, 13, ran upstairs and called 911. The police found the animal sitting near the Ganons' porch, calmly eating the candy.</p>
        <p>Though the township of Stillwater is sparsely settled, development has grown steadily in the last 20 years in sections of Sussex, Passaic, Morris and Warren Counties that were once covered with forests. The bears -- hearty eaters and intelligent, adaptable animals -- have come to rely on people to broaden their diet of berries, acorns, skunk cabbage, rabbits and other small mammals.</p>
        <p>Bears have long been meandering into settled areas, particularly in the summer, as the young are rousted from their lairs to make way for new offspring. But experts say the bears being spotted now tend to be older and more brazen.</p>
        <p>As their numbers grow, they have migrated to more thickly populated counties, including Bergen, Essex, Hunterdon and Somerset.</p>
        <p>They are also showing up in other parts of the region. Bears recently broke into a dozen homes in southeastern New York. One tore cabinets off a kitchen wall and tipped over a refrigerator while looking for food in Olive, in Ulster County, said Dick Henry, a New York State wildlife biologist.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, bear sightings and complaints tripled last year, to about 300, and livestock killings, a rarity in the state, were reported in its rural northwest, said Paul Rego, a state wildlife biologist.</p>
        <p>''What we're seeing is habituation of bears to people and to people's garbage,'' said Jon Rosenberg, superintendent of parks in West Milford, a bear haven in northern Passaic County. He has worked with New Jersey's bear research team since 1983. Female bears teach their cubs about food sources both in deep woods and in backyards, and the bears will return again and again for garbage, bird seed and pet food at homes, and for morsels at campsites and countryside picnics and cookouts, Mr. Rosenberg said.</p>
        <p>Black bears are easily intimidated if people yell, wave their arms or bang pots and pans. But repeated, uncontested forays into backyards can lessen the bears' natural shyness and wariness of people, he said.</p>
        <p>When Veronica Stevans moved to Stillwater 12 years ago, she occasionally spotted a bear at night near her home. ''It's a whole different world now,'' Ms. Stevans said. ''Now you see them at any time of day. They're bolder,'' she said, adding, ''They're not afraid of noise anymore.''</p>
        <p>Once, she said, she felt at ease walking alone on country roads. Now she brings along a four-inch can of pepper spray and her dog.</p>
        <p>''Bear proofing'' has become a way of life here. People talk of jogging and walking with whistles, air horns, firecrackers and pepper spray. Shooting bears, however, is currently illegal.</p>
        <p>Gay Quarty, who saw a bear near her barbecue grill last year, takes walks with a golf-ball-size jingle bell attached to one of her sneakers. ''It looks ugly and stupid, and I don't know if it really works,'' she said, ''but it gives me peace of mind.''</p>
        <p>Many people shut their windows and doors before they start cooking, to contain the smells, and many store garbage in their basements or sheds until pickup day. Paul Klimek has installed electric wiring around his pigpen and wraps bacon around the wires, guaranteeing a slight shock to any bear biting the meat.</p>
        <p>At Swartswood State Park, a stuffed black bear stands on its hind legs in the lobby, next to a picnic basket and a sign warning campers to keep all coolers and baskets in their cars when they are not being used. Campers face eviction and a $71 fine if they feed bears, intentionally or accidentally, and if their car windows are found open, even a crack, when food is stored inside.  Rangers say bears can stick their two-inch claws into a partly open window and rip it out to get the food.</p>
        <p>Since 1997, rangers at Swartswood and other state parks in or near the Kittatinny Mountains, including High Point, Stokes and Worthington, have shot rubber buckshot and explosive noisemakers at bears that linger around campsites or garbage bins. This tactic is meant to stop bears from associating people with ''positive rewards -- a snack or a meal,'' said Patrick Carr, principal wildlife biologist for the Division of Fish and Wildlife.</p>
        <p>But more drastic measures are being taken. Four bears deemed potentially dangerous were trapped and killed last year by New Jersey animal control agents, including two that had broken into homes in Sussex County. In March, the Fish and Game Council proposed the resumption of bear hunting, which the state banned in 1970, when the bear population had been all but wiped out.</p>
        <p>Hunting would be limited to the northern half of the state; bills to prohibit bear hunting have been introduced in the State Legislature, but they are stalled in committees.</p>
        <p>Opinions here on the proposal are divided, even among those who have had encounters with bears. The Township Council in West Milford,  where the animals are plentiful, says it opposes the hunt because bears are attractive and symbolize the state's little remaining wilderness.</p>
        <p>In Stillwater, Ed Szabo, a hunter, no longer hangs deer carcasses in trees behind his house to dry because bears ate them at night. He favors bear hunting, but says he has no interest in taking part.</p>
        <p>In Green Township, Dede Esenlohr said she sleeps uneasily because bears often come onto her deck at night. Last summer, she watched two bears kill two fawns in her yard.  ''We're not talking warm and fuzzy here,'' Ms. Esenlohr said. But she favors a sterilization program instead of a hunt that she says will lead to bears being wounded and left to suffer or turn dangerous.</p>
        <p>The Humane Society of the United States, which opposes the hunt, has asked the state to conduct a joint study into injecting 20 female bears with a vaccine that prevents conception. The state has not responded, said Allen Rutberg, the society's senior wildlife scientist. ''The bear problem in New Jersey is not a crisis, not like the deer issue,'' Dr. Rutberg said.</p>
        <p>But bears inspire a fear that deer do not, especially after a death last month in Gatlinburg, Tenn. On May 21, the body of Glenda Ann Bradley, 50, of Cosby, Tenn., a teacher and experienced hiker, was found partly eaten by two bears in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. An autopsy to determine if the bears had  killed her is not complete, said Nancy Gray, a park spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Lynn Rogers of Ely, Minn., an expert on black bears, said fatal attacks by black bears are extremely rare -- only about 40 in North America in this century. People face a greater chance of being killed by dogs, lightning or bee stings, he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rogers said there is no clear explanation for the fatal attacks.  Some of the animals were skinny and hungry and others were injured, he said. ''All we can say is, thank goodness they're very rare,'' he said. ''Who knows the reason why the rare bear becomes a predator?''</p>
