        <p>The oldest annual pair championship in the world is the Goldman, which has been played at the Eastern Regionals since 1928 and has usually been won by players of great experience.</p>
        <p>One of the first winners was Oswald Jacoby, however, then 25 and at the start of a great career. One of the 73rd winners, in Parsippany, N.J., a week ago, was Chris Willenken of Manhattan, who is even younger. He is a 24-year-old options trader and has a bright future in the game.</p>

        <p>The oldest annual pair championship in the world is the Goldman, which has been played at the Eastern Regionals since 1928 and has usually been won by players of great experience.</p>
        <p>One of the first winners was Oswald Jacoby, however, then 25 and at the start of a great career. One of the 73rd winners, in Parsippany, N.J., a week ago, was Chris Willenken of Manhattan, who is even younger. He is a 24-year-old options trader and has a bright future in the game.</p>
        <p>His partner was Aaron Silverstein, 33, also of Manhattan, who is a bridge teacher. They finished almost a board ahead of Linda and Robb Gordon, and both have a chance for a  rare double. With different partners, they reached the Reisinger Team semifinals, which ended last night.</p>
        <p>Willenken, playing for a team led by Richard Schwartz, trailed by 11 imps at the midpoint of a match against a foursome headed by John Roberts. Silverstein, a member of a group captained by Richard De Martino, trailed by 28 against Adam Wildavsky and his team.</p>
        <p>On the diagramed deal from the Goldman, Willenken, with a balanced two-point hand, did not expect to find himself playing in a game contract after an opponent had opened the bidding. But his partner drove him into a shaky four spades and West led the diamond jack. South won with dummy's king, then cashed two spade winners and the diamond ace.</p>
        <p>Facing an acute shortage of entries to his hand, South temporized by leading a third trump. This forced West to do something helpful, and he chose to lead the ace and queen of hearts. After winning with the king, South led the club jack from dummy.</p>
        <p>East did his best by playing low smoothly, and West won with the queen. A heart lead was ruffed in the closed hand, and the ending was this:</p>
        <p>Willenken cashed his diamond queen and had to work out the club position. West was known to have begun with a balanced hand, and had produced 12 high-card points. If he also held the club king, his hand would have qualified for one no-trump, using the 15-17 range.</p>
        <p>He had not bid one no-trump, so Willenken led to the club ace, dropped the king and made a game that helped the partnership win a venerable title.</p>
