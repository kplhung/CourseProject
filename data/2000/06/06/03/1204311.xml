        <p>The Nasdaq composite index had its best week ever, soaring 6.44 percent yesterday after the government announced that unemployment rose in May and wages were nearly flat. Investors hoped that would mean the Federal Reserve would stop raising interest rates.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq gained 230.88 points, to 3,813.38, and for the week was up 19 percent -- well above the previous gain of 9.7 percent from April 17 to 21.</p>
