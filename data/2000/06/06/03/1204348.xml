        <p>As graduates at the City College of New York sweltered in yesterday's heat, the journalist David Halberstam urged them to take advantage of ''the luxury of choice'' that a college education offered and to do what they loved best in life, ''even if it is unfashionable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Halberstam, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1964 for his reporting on Vietnam for The New York Times and who has written books on politics, sports and American culture, noted in his commencement address  that many of the 2,250 graduates were the first in their families to attend college. That privilege, Mr. Halberstam said, would allow them to make choices that their parents could never have imagined.</p>

        <p>As graduates at the City College of New York sweltered in yesterday's heat, the journalist David Halberstam urged them to take advantage of ''the luxury of choice'' that a college education offered and to do what they loved best in life, ''even if it is unfashionable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Halberstam, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1964 for his reporting on Vietnam for The New York Times and who has written books on politics, sports and American culture, noted in his commencement address  that many of the 2,250 graduates were the first in their families to attend college. That privilege, Mr. Halberstam said, would allow them to make choices that their parents could never have imagined.</p>
        <p>''In this country as in no other that I know of, ordinary people have the right to reinvent themselves and become the person of their dreams,'' Mr. Halberstam said. ''As much as anything else, this is what separates us from the Old World.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Halberstam's speech and several others at yesterday's ceremony focused on the ethnic diversity of City College students, more than half of whom were born in other countries. The college, part of the City University of New York system, drew immigrant students from the time it opened in 1847 and became known as ''the poor man's Harvard.''</p>
        <p>''If any foreigners are puzzled about America, about what our secret strength is,'' Mr. Halberstam said, ''let them come to a college like CCNY, the portal to the American dream.''</p>
        <p>City University awarded honorary degrees yesterday to Mr. Halberstam; Joyce R. Coppin, the superintendent of Brooklyn high schools; Nathan Glazer, an emeritus professor of education and sociology at Harvard; George Lamming, a writer; and Henry J. Stern, New York City's parks commissioner. All but Mr. Lamming and Mr. Halberstam are graduates of City College.</p>
        <p>The valedictorian, Pamela A. Margid, received a bachelor's degree in history and English and won a fellowship to study American history at Cornell University next year. In her speech, Ms. Margid praised CUNY's policy of open admissions, which the trustees voted to end last year.</p>
        <p>Now that the policy is gone, she said, ''we only hope that cultural diversity will continue to thrive'' at City College. Ms. Margid said that she had heard ''some of the most heated, controversial and honest discussions about racial issues'' at City College, and that those discussions had helped her reassess her own assumptions about race.</p>
        <p>''These conversations are often uncomfortable,'' she said. ''But stretching one's mind and vision stems from that very discomfort and leads to enlightening thought. This represents true progress.''</p>
        <p>Hunter College</p>
        <p>Lia Lynch dropped out of the Bronx High School of Science at 16 and fled family problems by sleeping at the homes of friends and in $20-a-night flophouses. Four years ago, just as she had her life back together, earning a decent living as a bookkeeper, taking her first vacation and living on the Upper West Side, her company downsized and she was laid off.</p>
        <p>The boss who laid her off told her to go to college.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Ms. Lynch, now 30, was one of 1,000 students who received bachelor's degrees from Hunter College at a ceremony in Central Park. She was honored as outstanding student, with a 4.0 average, a full scholarship as a doctoral candidate in English at Princeton University and two fellowships.</p>
        <p>Gathered in the Summer Stage, she and the other students listened to the commencement speaker, Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, urge them to combat bigotry wherever they found it.</p>
        <p>And then, in a more private moment, Ms. Lynch, stripping to a slip-dress and tattoos in the near-summer heat, told how she bounced back from her teenage despair. Like many other City University students, she is older than a typical undergraduate. It was scary, she said, just to get her equivalency diploma. She had no College Board test scores. And she said she thought that without open admissions, she never would have been admitted to Hunter, one of the university system's more rigorous campuses.</p>
        <p>Her mother, who moved from Puerto Rico, is a public-school aide  and could not help pay her tuition. Her father left the family when she was young. She worked her way through college as a bartender.  Yesterday, her mother, Ana Laureano; her grandmother, Antoinette Laureano; and her favorite cousin, Jose Rosado, sat proudly in the folding chairs to watch her receive her diploma. Her mother said she knew Lia was special from the time she was 3 1/2, when she taught herself to read Little Golden Books because her mother was too busy to read them to her.</p>
        <p>''I knew the day would come,'' her mother said. ''But it had to be on her terms.''</p>
