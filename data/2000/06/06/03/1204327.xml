        <p>Editorial supports proposal by Peter Vallone, speaker of New York City Council, to deploy 50 toilets on streets where they are most needed</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In a city of millions, it is a disgrace that there are so few public bathrooms and that New York City officials have failed to build any new pay toilets for public use despite years of debate. Now Peter Vallone, the City Council speaker, has proposed a modest start -- 50 toilets that would be deployed on city streets where most urgently needed. The proposal should not get sidelined again as city leaders finish their budget negotiations in the next few days. If Paris, London, Athens and even Palo Alto can manage to make modern, even stylish toilets available, New Yorkers deserve their own advanced resolution to this civic need as well.</p>
        <p>Since the early 1990's, officials have agonized over the right way to provide public toilets. The most extravagant plans, which were junked about four years ago when they became mired in politics and public debate, envisioned grand 30-foot-high structures that would be multi-purpose centers complete with a news kiosk, telephone, shelter for bus riders and toilet. Mr. Vallone's suggestion sheds the extras and focuses on the critical need.</p>

        <p>In a city of millions, it is a disgrace that there are so few public bathrooms and that New York City officials have failed to build any new pay toilets for public use despite years of debate. Now Peter Vallone, the City Council speaker, has proposed a modest start -- 50 toilets that would be deployed on city streets where most urgently needed. The proposal should not get sidelined again as city leaders finish their budget negotiations in the next few days. If Paris, London, Athens and even Palo Alto can manage to make modern, even stylish toilets available, New Yorkers deserve their own advanced resolution to this civic need as well.</p>
        <p>Since the early 1990's, officials have agonized over the right way to provide public toilets. The most extravagant plans, which were junked about four years ago when they became mired in politics and public debate, envisioned grand 30-foot-high structures that would be multi-purpose centers complete with a news kiosk, telephone, shelter for bus riders and toilet. Mr. Vallone's suggestion sheds the extras and focuses on the critical need.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone's sense of urgency is understandable, and there are some indications that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration would agree to start the design and bidding process for the first 50 units. The cost for each facility could be $60,000 to $100,000, excluding maintenance. The newer outdoor toilets under consideration are designed to be self-cleaning, and some units open automatically after a certain interval to discourage the homeless or anyone else from taking up long-term residence. Users are typically charged 25 cents to 50 cents, depending on whether there is space for advertising, and some cities give tokens to the homeless.</p>
        <p>The details of location, design, cost and maintenance would have to be worked out. But given the maze of competitive bidding and board approvals that any capital project must navigate in New York City, it is certainly not too early to start.</p>
