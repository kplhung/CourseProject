        <p>So Much for Guarantees</p>
        <p>Coach Jeff Van Gundy has nothing against confidence, but to find Chris Childs and Patrick Ewing handing out pregame guarantees like brochures featuring their own bravado only made him breathe a sigh of disdain yesterday.</p>
        <p>''I think it's ridiculous,'' Van Gundy said hours before his Knicks were eliminated by the Pacers last night.</p>
        <p>''You don't have to share your confidence with everyone else. Of course, they expect to win, just like Indiana expects to win. If you're going to say it for this game, you should guarantee it every night. It has no bearing on the game. There's no reason to guarantee something you can't guarantee.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy added: ''They confuse confidence with unnecessary gibberish. I just don't understand it. It doesn't make any sense to me.</p>
        <p>''It's just like the Georgetown motto after every loss of a season series. It must be passed down from generation to generation. They all say it -- 'We're the better team.' ''</p>
        <p>Over the past year, Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo, who played for Georgetown, called the Hawks the better team even after the Knicks swept them last season. Two weeks ago, Alonzo Mourning, another former Hoya, contended that the Heat was still superior to the Knicks despite being eliminated.</p>
        <p>''It's a rite of passage,'' Van Gundy said. ''And Othella Harrington, when Vancouver makes it, he'll say it, too. It's just how it is. It doesn't mean I understand it.''</p>
