        <p>A crane being used to build an elevated rail line to Kennedy International Airport was set afire in Queens yesterday, and its 120-foot tower toppled to the ground minutes later, narrowly missing firefighters who were struggling to extinguish the blaze, officials said.</p>
        <p>None of the 62 firefighters who responded to the 2 a.m. fire alongside the Van Wyck Expressway, near South Conduit Road, were seriously injured, officials said. But the crane, which was helping build a rail line linking the airport to the Long Island Rail Road station in Jamaica, was destroyed.</p>
        <p>''Thank God the units were not positioned in front of the crane,'' said Chief Brian Dixon, a Fire Department spokesman, referring to the firefighters. ''There was no warning when it fell.''</p>
        <p>Investigators said the fire had been set by someone who broke into a work shed at the construction site, stole gasoline canisters and used them to douse the cab of the crane, a $1.8 million Manitowoc 888 owned by Bay Crane of Queens. Last night, fire marshals were trying to find a security guard who had been scheduled to work at the site at the time of the fire.</p>
        <p>The crane's tower collapsed about 2:15 a.m. when the fire reached the hydraulic lines that support the tower, officials said.</p>
        <p>Officials said they had not identified any suspects and were not aware of any labor unrest or threats of vandalism against the project or Airrail Transit Consortium, the lead contractor on the $1.5 billion rail line.</p>
        <p>The project, which is intended to make it easier to reach the airport by public transportation, has been the subject of several demonstrations in recent days, including one on Thursday, by the Southeast Queens Concerned Neighbors, an umbrella group that represents several dozen civic associations in the area. Many residents say the construction has made traffic problems worse, disrupted their sleep and shaken the foundations of their homes.</p>
        <p>But leaders of the group said it was inconceivable that any members would resort to arson. ''We have had peaceful demonstrations,'' said Freida Latimer, president of the Square Deal Civic Association, which is part of the umbrella group. ''We are not about destroying.''</p>
        <p>The crane was being used to build the elevated support structure for the rail line, which will consist of two spurs: one connecting the airport to a subway station in Howard Beach and a second that will parallel the Van Wyck Expressway to connect with the railroad station in Jamaica.</p>
        <p>Officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is financing the rail line, said the vandalism would not delay the project, which is more than half done and is set to be completed by 2003.</p>
        <p>Ralph Singletary, whose house faces the construction site, said the pounding of pile drivers over the last two months had cracked the walls and undermined the foundation of his home on the Van Wyck service road, near 120th Avenue.</p>
        <p>Greg Trevor, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said the agency had  tried to be a good neighbor by sending monthly construction updates to homeowners and quickly settling damage claims. So far, 32 property owners have filed claims and 16 have been settled, he said, many of them within 48 hours.</p>
