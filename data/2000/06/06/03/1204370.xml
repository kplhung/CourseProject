        <p>The United Nations' chief war crimes prosecutor said today that there was no basis for a formal investigation into whether NATO committed war crimes during the bombing of Yugoslavia a year ago.</p>
        <p>''Although some mistakes were made by NATO, I am very satisfied that there was no deliberate targeting of civilians or unlawful military targets by NATO during the bombing campaign,'' the prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte of Switzerland, told the Security Council. She said a detailed statement on her decision would be released as early as next week.</p>
        <p>A parliamentary commission from Russia, Yugoslavia's strongest international supporter, and Western lawyers working for the Yugoslav government had brought allegations of NATO war crimes to the tribunal last year. Several rights groups have also raised questions about NATO attacks on civilian targets.</p>
        <p>The 11-week NATO bombing campaign was intended to stop Yugoslav repression of Albanians in Kosovo, the Serbian province now under the administration of NATO and the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Among the NATO actions taken to the Balkans tribunal by critics alleging war crimes were an airstrike on a passenger train crossing a targeted bridge; the bombing of a Serbian television center; killing of refugees in a convoy mistaken for soldiers; the use of cluster bombs that can fragment over a wide area, in one case hitting grounds of a hospital; and the use of depleted uranium in weapons. There were also more general allegations of genocide and deliberate environmental destruction.</p>
        <p>''I am now able to announce my conclusion, following a full consideration of my team's assessment of all complaints and allegations, that there is no basis for opening an investigation into any of those allegations or into other incidents related to the NATO bombing,'' Ms. Del Ponte, a former Swiss attorney general, told the council. She did not discuss the allegations themselves.</p>
        <p>The Balkans war crimes tribunal, based in The Hague, has played down the importance of these charges since they were first made public late last year. Officials have said that the tribunal was formed to charge individuals, not institutions or organizations, with war crimes. NATO officials have answered or dismissed the charges, but have said errors were committed.</p>
        <p>Among these they include the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. American officials subsequently said that the bombing was an accident resulting from the use of outdated maps and incorrect intelligence information, but China has rejected this explanation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Del Ponte, also chief prosecutor of a war crimes tribunal for Rwanda, conducted only an informal study of the allegations against NATO, officials said. She has been more deeply involved in formal charges against Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, who was indicted by the tribunal last year.</p>
        <p>But she told the council that she felt she had to examine the allegations against NATO because it was her ''obligation and responsibility'' to look into all complaints.</p>
