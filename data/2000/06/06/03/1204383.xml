        <p>Indiana Pacers Mark Jackson and Reggie Miller have played 13 years and finally will get to National Basketball Association finals (M)</p>

        <p>Mark Jackson's eyes were rimmed with red, and soon the tears trickled down his face. Emotion left him speechless for a few moments until he pursed his lips and said with a heavy sigh: ''There's a side of me that is so thankful. I just want to thank the guys in here for dreaming it.''</p>
        <p>Thirteen years removed from his rookie-of-the-year season with the Knicks, Jackson had earned his first trip to the National Basketball Association finals in his sixth year with the Indiana Pacers. Thirteen years removed from his rookie season with the Pacers, Reggie Miller finally made it his destination.</p>
        <p>Four painful near-misses in the conference finals, including one on Larry Johnson's 4-point play in Game 6 last year in Madison Square Garden, and a Game 7 loss to the Chicago Bulls in 1998 -- were erased by the Pacers' 93-80 victory in Game 6 last night.</p>
        <p>''Reg and I have been talking about this for years and years and years and time and time again, keeping each other up all night long, calling in the middle of the night and wondering how are you feeling,'' Jackson said. ''We have gotten there time and time again, but to finally finish it off was awesome.''</p>
        <p>Miller exited the game with eight seconds left, having detonated the biggest bomb in his career in Madison Square Garden by scoring 34 points, 17 in the fourth quarter alone. He had made good on his promise to ''kill the dog'' and stick the dagger in the dying Knicks.</p>
        <p>After the vicious talk before the game, the first thing Miller did afterward was give Jackson a hug. Jackson, an ordained minister, and Miller, a preordained Knicks killer, could not help but be swept up in the emotion.</p>
        <p>''We talked a whole lot of noise about what we were going to do if we won,'' Miller said. ''But I think like Mark said, New York was very gracious last year in upsetting us. We did the traditional jumping up and down, but you never want to rub it into anyone's face.''</p>
        <p>When the Pacers got to their locker room, they started hollering. Then Miller began to talk, thanking his teammates for giving him the opportunity to get to the finals. He was reflective and nearly in tears.</p>
        <p>Of the Pacers' 12 players, only Sam Perkins, 39, playing for his fifth team, had been to the N.B.A. finals before, with Seattle in 1996.</p>
        <p>''Going into the game, none of these guys have never been to the finals,'' he said, which explains why Jackson would jump out of character and start crying, Perkins added. And it explains why Miller would make a heartfelt speech afterward.</p>
        <p>''They've been going at it for so long, the both of them,'' Perkins said. ''It's satisfying finally getting here.''</p>
        <p>But even the younger players, like Jalen Rose, in his fifth year, could understand the emotion. ''This is a wonderful feeling,'' said Rose, who scored 11 points. ''This is our third straight year here. For a lot of these guys, it feels like eight years. It's been a long road. We've knocked on the doors a lot of times and now we're in.''</p>
        <p>Indiana kicked down the door this year because the Pacers made Game 6 into Game 7, treating it as if it were their last.</p>
        <p>''We didn't want to go to Game 7,'' said Dale Davis, who for the fourth time this series pulled down 16 rebounds. ''We were really anxious to get to the finals and we stepped up the last two games.''</p>
        <p>Jackson ignited the Pacers' 30-point first quarter with 5 of his 9 points. It was the first time since Game 1 that Indiana won a first quarter.</p>
        <p>When the Pacers squandered what had been a 13-point lead in the third quarter, Miller scored 8 of the team's 12 points.</p>
        <p>In the fourth quarter, Travis Best, who had scored a team-high 24 points in Game 5, came off the bench for Jackson and scored 8 of his 10 points. He and Miller had all of the crucial points in that period, including two back-to-back field goals with less than four minutes remaining to give the Pacers an 11-point advantage, and Best sank two foul shots three minutes later to preserve the victory.</p>
        <p>''I just wanted to be out there with him to make some plays with him, and fortunately my shot was going down,'' Best said.</p>
        <p>But the Pacers did not excel just offensively. For the second straight game, they concentrated on playing stringent one-on-one defense, motivated by their coach, a three-time N.B.A. champion.</p>
        <p>''It is a great thing that happened to our veteran players that have been around the league and battled so hard over the years and never had an opportunity to play in the finals,'' Coach Larry Bird said. ''This is their day.''</p>
