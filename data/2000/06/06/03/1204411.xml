      <abstract>
        <p>Doug Giebel letter replies to Elisa Massimino's June 2 Op-Ed article on Elian Gonzalez case; says there is no evidence that the 6-year-old Cuban boy ever asked for asylum in US</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Elisa Massimino (''A Ruling's Risks for Other Elians,'' Op-Ed, June 2) is rightly concerned about the effect of the court decision upholding immigration officials' right to let Elian Gonzalez's father take the boy back to Cuba. The Immigration and Naturalization Service may not always act in a child's best interest when deciding whether to grant asylum.</p>
        <p>The problem with the Gonzalez case, however, is that there's no evidence that Elian, who is 6, ever asked for asylum, or that at his age he has any concept of the meaning of asylum.</p>

        <p>If Elian returns to Cuba from the United States, the upside may be that he will be responsible for improved relations between the two countries. And it's doubtful that when he reaches the ripe old age of 18 he will be prevented from traveling freely to or living in any country in the world.</p>
