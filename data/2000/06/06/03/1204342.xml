        <p>In a bid to recast a security debate just before his summit meeting with President Clinton, President Vladimir V. Putin has suggested an alternative to the proposed American defense against missile attack by nations like North Korea.</p>
        <p>Agreeing with the American assessment that so-called rogue states pose a nuclear threat, Mr. Putin hinted that the United States and Russia could collaborate on new ways to shoot down enemy missiles soon after they were launched, rather than in space. The Russian proposal is intended to replace the plan for a nationwide shield to protect the United States against incoming warheads that the Clinton administration has proposed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's alternative approach seems to resemble the plan known in the United States as ''boost phase defense,'' which has been proposed by a number of arms control advocates. Russian officials have been talking privately to American negotiators about the idea in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>Advocates of such an approach in the United States say it would provide the United States, Europe and Russia with the protection that the administration insists it needs from so-called rogue states.</p>
        <p>Such a system would be of little use against the Russian nuclear force. That would make it far more acceptable to the Russian military, which fears that a solely American missile defense would be used to gain a strategic edge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's remarks were made in an interview with ''The NBC Nightly News.'' Parts of the interview were broadcast Thursday night, and other parts will be shown over the weekend. A complete transcript was made available today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is to arrive here on Saturday and stay until Monday.</p>
        <p>Administration officials reacted cautiously to Mr. Putin's comments, which were very sketchy and at times hard to interpret.</p>
        <p>They said his approach appeared to suggest an unacceptable substitute for the administration's missile defense plan, which involves the deployment of 100 interceptors and a battle-management radar in Alaska to protect all 50 American states.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton says he will make a final decision on whether to develop such a defense based on a coming test, and new assessments of the threat and of the effect of a missile system on arms control. But there is tremendous political momentum behind the program, and Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic nominee to succeed Mr. Clinton, has already endorsed such a limited defense.</p>
        <p>The remarks by the Russian president were important as an opening move in what promises to be a difficult negotiation. In the interview, Mr. Putin acknowledged that the emerging missile threat -- one that Washington has associated with North Korea, Iran and other nations -- was indeed a growing danger for the United States, Russia and Europe. In the past, Russia dismissed such concerns as unwarranted.</p>
        <p>Rather than flatly rejecting the idea of new antimissile systems, as many Moscow officials have been doing publicly in recent months, Mr. Putin's remarks indicated that the Kremlin believes that some type of political pressures on those nations, as well as antimissile systems, might be needed.</p>
        <p>''As to new threats that they talk about in the United States, we agree with that,'' Mr. Putin said. ''We should create new mechanisms that will protect us from these threats.''</p>
        <p>Without mentioning North Korea or Iran by name, Mr. Putin noted that certain third world nations lacked long-range bombers or missile-firing submarines to threaten the United States. But they are, he acknowledged, developing long-range, land-based missiles.</p>
        <p>''If you are talking about threats that are directed or could be directed at Russia or at the United States,'' he said, ''there are countries that have that capability today that can only do that from their own territory.''</p>
        <p>The Russian leader then went on to describe a possible way to deal with those threats, apparently alluding to the possibility of a boost-phase defense that would prevent emerging third world powers from attacking Russia and the West with missiles.</p>
        <p>''So we could jointly put up these umbrellas above potential areas of threat,'' he said. ''With this umbrella, we could jointly protect all of Europe.''</p>
        <p>The reference to Europe also seemed to be a way of scoring points with Western Europeans, who are very skeptical of the American missile defense plan. The administration plan would protect only American territory, and senior administration officials have made only vague comments about Washington's willingness to share antimissile technology with the European allies.</p>
        <p>China might not welcome collaboration between Russia and the United States on missile defense. But the limited approach proposed by Mr. Putin might be seen by Beijing as far less threatening that the more extensive American system, which would neutralize the Chinese deterrent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's remarks developed some themes discussed with American officials by Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov and other Russian officials, some of whom hinted at the boost-phase approach. Russian politicians said Mr. Putin's comments should be seen more as inviting a dialogue with Washington on missile defense, albeit on Moscow's terms, than as a detailed proposal.</p>
        <p>''It is an important political gesture toward the United States,'' Andrei Kokoshin, a senior lawmaker who was national security adviser when Boris N. Yeltsin was president, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kokoshin said the aim of Mr. Putin's plan was to explore ways to meet some of Washington's concerns by adapting ''theater missile defense'' systems. These are land-based interceptors that were originally intended to counter attacks by short- and medium-range missiles and which are allowed by the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</p>
        <p>The Kremlin's goal, he acknowledged, was to persuade the administration to abandon its more ambitious program, which would require amending the ABM treaty.</p>
        <p>''Theater missile defense is capable of boost-phase interception,'' Mr. Kokoshin said in an interview. ''It would be a more perfect solution in terms of overall strategic stability than the unilateral American decision to build a national missile defense.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's suggestions still leave Washington and Moscow with deep differences. Administration officials have said they do not expect a breakthrough at the summit meeting here, but rather are hoping to establish a dialogue that could lead to an accord on an antimissile system and nuclear weapons reductions before the end of the Clinton presidency.</p>
        <p>The administration does not agree that the theater systems Mr. Putin is referring to would be effective against a third world missile threat. And the two sides are far apart on the related issue of slashing strategic arms, with the Russians insisting on deeper cuts. Still, American officials sought to accent the positive.</p>
        <p>''There are nuggets we can work with in a positive way,'' a senior administration official said. ''They are recognizing the ballistic missile threat and talking about cooperating to meet that threat. But we do not see this as a substitute for our national missile defense program.''</p>
        <p>Other American experts outside the administration were more positive. They said Mr. Putin's plan might lead to a better system from the point of view of American as well as Russian interests.</p>
        <p>Richard Garwin, a leading physicist who served on a Congressional panel on the emerging missile defense, argued that a boost-phase system would be far more effective than the administration's proposal because it would intercept attacking missiles before they reached their full speed and dispersed their warheads and decoys.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garwin has proposed deploying such a defense on ships near the Korean peninsula and perhaps on Russian territory. He and Ted Postol, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who also supports a boost-phase approach, have discussed the plan with Russian officials and experts and promoted it as an alternative to the administration's approach.</p>
        <p>''It is a lot easier to put a lid over North Korea than an umbrella over the United States and Eastern Pacific,'' Mr. Garwin said.</p>
        <p>The plan promoted by Mr. Garwin, however, would require amending the ABM treaty.</p>
        <p>In his NBC interview, Mr. Putin spoke of the need to preserve the ABM accord, which sets strict limits on the testing and deployment of antimissile systems, saying it was a condition for arms cuts.</p>
