        <p>Unemployment Rate Rose To 4.1 Percent Last Month  In the strongest signal yet that the booming economy is finally slowing, the Labor Department reported that the nation's private sector employers shed 116,000 jobs in May. It was the largest drop in more than eight years and the first decline since the economy began to soar in the mid-1990's.</p>

        <p>Unemployment Rate Rose To 4.1 Percent Last Month  In the strongest signal yet that the booming economy is finally slowing, the Labor Department reported that the nation's private sector employers shed 116,000 jobs in May. It was the largest drop in more than eight years and the first decline since the economy began to soar in the mid-1990's.</p>
        <p>The unemployment rate edged up to 4.1 percent from 3.9 percent, with blacks and Hispanics absorbing most of the loss. Wage increases, which had accelerated in the early spring, eased in May, reducing concerns about inflation. Jobs disappeared in almost every sector of the economy, except government, where the hiring of 357,000 census takers for the once-a-decade population count offset the decline in business jobs.

        <p>More H.M.O.'s Are Exiting Medicare  More health maintenance organizations, including Cigna and Aetna, will soon pull out of Medicare or curtail their participation, disrupting insurance coverage for thousands of elderly people, according to federal officials, independent experts and managed care executives. Despite pledges by the Clinton administration to slow the withdrawal, the exodus may actually accelerate this year, a White House official and several experts said. [A1.]</p>
        <p>F.A.A. May Ground Alaska Airlines  The Federal Aviation Administration threatened to shut down major maintenance operations at Alaska Airlines, which would ground the airline within months. The agency, its attention drawn to the airline by a fatal crash last January and a federal grand jury investigation, said that the carrier had a persistent problem in keeping track of whether required maintenance had been done, and that managers had not noticed the problem.

        <p>Oprah Magazine Editor to Resign  The editor of O: The Oprah Magazine is resigning for personal reasons, forcing the owners of the top-selling women's glossy to find a new leader after just one issue went on sale. Ellen Kunes, a longtime editor of women's magazines, said her decision was prompted by ''work-family issues'' and had nothing to do with the way the magazine was run. [C15.]</p>
        <p>Brazilian Pension Fund Controversy  In a political race that was major news in Brazil but little noticed abroad, a radical-left coalition now controls all three elected seats on the six-member board of the nation's largest and most influential pension fund. Two radical leftist candidates who won seats in an election last month began their terms Thursday, joining an incumbent colleague on the board of the fund, known as Previ. That gives them unprecedented power to block decisions that require a majority vote. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Another Loss for Soros Hedge Fund  The hedge fund empire of George Soros continued to shrink as Duncan Hennes, left, who was hired last summer to be chief executive of Soros Fund Management, announced his resignation. ''I was brought in to do one thing, and George doesn't want to do that anymore,'' Mr. Hennes, 43, said. That thing, he said, was to build a larger hedge fund business. Mr. Soros announced in April that his two top fund managers, Stanley Druckenmiller and Nicholas Roditi, were leaving and that the fund that made Mr. Soros famous, the Quantum Fund, would be renamed the Quantum Endowment Fund and changed in emphasis to reduce its risk.

        <p>F.T.C. to Sue to Halt Kroger Deal  The Federal Trade Commission announced that it would sue to halt Kroger's proposed purchase of 74 Winn-Dixie Stores supermarkets in Oklahoma and Texas. The F.T.C. voted 5 to 0 to seek a preliminary injunction in a Federal District Court in Dallas. A Kroger spokesman said the company would explore its legal alternatives. Kroger has more than 2,300 stores in 31 states. [C4.]</p>
