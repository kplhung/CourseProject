        <p>An accidental collapse inside the partly demolished New York Coliseum yesterday trapped two construction workers under concrete and twisted steel rubble until co-workers freed one victim and special city rescue crews extricated the other.</p>
        <p>The two men, Bernard Pilgrim, 40, of Brooklyn, and Cecil Jagarnaeh, 50, of Queens, were hospitalized in stable condition with cuts, bruises and leg injuries.</p>
        <p>''There was a loud bang and then a rumble,'' said a co-worker, Joe Carloni, of Newark. ''It felt like tremors.''</p>
        <p>Capt. Joseph Amato of the Fire Department said the two victims were entangled in cement, steel reinforcing bars and debris. He said the scene was ''like Oklahoma City or the World Trade Center,'' referring to damage from bombings there.</p>
        <p>Police and fire vehicles and ambulances surrounded the site, on Columbus Circle, and blocked off traffic in the area.</p>
        <p>One official at the scene told superiors that he believed the floor might have collapsed from the weight of demolition debris on it, but there was no confirmation of that theory. Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the site, said he had ''no knowledge'' of whether it was true.</p>
        <p>The accident occurred in the exhibition hall part of the building at about 9:40 a.m. as workers on the first floor were repairing a piece of heavy equipment, described by officials as a crane or an excavator. It suddenly toppled over on its side, said Deputy Chief Thomas Galvin of the Fire Department, causing a large section of the foot-thick concrete floor to collapse into the basement and subbasement.</p>
        <p>Despite concerns about their own safety, some 200 city rescue workers helped to stabilize the floor around the crater, described as about 75 feet by 75 feet. Sgt. Michael Curtin of the Police Department's Emergency Services Unit said, ''It was never safe for us to go in there.''</p>
        <p>With the disabled equipment perched precariously at the edge of the crater and its crane tipped at an angle, workers moved to secure it with steel cables. Then part of it was cut away and moved, to relieve pressure on the rubble and on Mr. Jagarnaeh, who was still pinned beneath.</p>
        <p>''Get me out of here,'' Sgt. John Kiernan quoted the victim as pleading. Fifteen rescuers rappelled into the basement to free him. Police Officer John McKenna said rescuers had to cut reinforcing bars in the concrete to get him out. Wary of using heavy equipment or of creating vibrations, workers used hand tools, their bare hands and brute force to pull away chunks of debris.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pilgrim, the first to be freed, was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center about 10:20 a.m. About 10 minutes later, Mr. Jagarnaeh was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center's trauma unit.</p>
        <p>''The second guy should be out buying Lotto tickets,'' said the director of the city's Office of Emergency Management, Richard J. Sheirer, ''because he is a very lucky man.''</p>
        <p>Because the M.T.A. is a state agency, the city's Buildings Department said it had no jurisdiction to inspect the demolition work. Mr. Kelly said his agency has been closely monitoring the project. ''In fact, the site was inspected last week,'' he said, ''and no problems were found.''</p>
        <p>The demolition contractor, the Safeway Environmental Corporation of Queens, has a record of citations for various violations at the Coliseum and at other sites, according to city and federal records.</p>
        <p>City environmental inspectors have issued citations for air pollution and noise at the Coliseum, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. Safeway has also been cited for air pollution, noise, closing streets without a permit and improper handling of asbestos at other sites in the 1990's. The United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration also has a record of violations against Safeway in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Safeway referred questions to Columbus Centre, which is redeveloping the Coliseum site and which hired Safeway. Columbus Centre's spokesman, Rubenstein Public Relations, said that the project ''has been progressing under strict safety controls and procedures.''</p>
        <p>The Coliseum is being replaced by a $1.6 billion complex including a Lincoln Center jazz hall, AOL-Time Warner headquarters, a Mandarin Oriental Hotel, restaurants, stores and apartments.</p>
