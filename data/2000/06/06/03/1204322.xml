        <p>The Pataki administration gave final environmental approval today to plans to build the nation's largest power plant along a verdant stretch of the Hudson River 30 miles south of here, signaling the start of a new generation of plant construction in New York.</p>
        <p>The introduction of competition in the electricity market and a surge in demand in the last few years have created a sudden rush to build power plants in the Northeast, after a generation of a lack of interest among power companies. The plant approved today, in the town of Athens in Greene County on the west bank of the river, is expected to be followed in quick succession by half a dozen or more in the next few years.</p>
        <p>The $500 million Athens plant, proposed by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Corporation, a major California utility company, would be New York's first example of new technology that makes natural-gas fired power plants much more efficient than older ones and, as a result, put out far less air pollution. Environmentalists say its emissions would be less than 10 percent of those from a plant built in the 1970's or earlier.</p>
        <p>It will also be the first plant to take advantage of new cooling methods that allow it to use far less water from the river than older plants do, an important environmental concern because water intake pipes and the discharge of heated water into the river can kill fish by the millions.</p>
        <p>In fact, the state set a much tougher standard on water use than had been expected. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric expressed disappointment at that decision, but said it would not prevent the company from proceeding with the project.</p>
        <p>''We are very fortunate that the technology has advanced to the point that we can have efficient, low-cost power with very little effect on the environment, and we are insisting on the best available technology,'' said John P. Cahill, commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>
        <p>Since it was proposed two years ago, the Athens plant has met with ferocious local opposition, in part because it represented the beginning of a boom in industrial development on the banks of the Hudson, after the river had undergone more than a half-century of transition from an industrial thoroughfare to the attractive centerpiece of a fairly bucolic region. In recent months, opponents repeatedly tried to portray Pacific Gas &amp; Electric as a corporate villain, reminding reporters and politicians that it was the company that polluted ground water in a California town, in a case made famous by the movie ''Erin Brockovich.''</p>
        <p>Community and environmental groups protested that the plant would mar the view of a swath of the Hudson Valley filled with forests, farms and small towns -- a view made famous by the 19th-century painters of the Hudson River School. Environmentalists also said the plant could disrupt a sensitive spawning ground for fish.</p>
        <p>''It is in absolutely the wrong place,'' said David Gordon, a lawyer with the group Riverkeeper.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists and Democrats in the Legislature have also complained that a new state law on approving power plants, pushed through by Gov. George E. Pataki last year, does not contain enough environmental safeguards.</p>
        <p>But many environmentalists, while they disliked the process and the location of the Athens plant, also hailed the construction of new, more efficient plants as an important advance against air and water pollution. They hope that the new plants, combined with new air emissions regulations Governor Pataki has promised to impose on older, dirtier plants, will put some of those old plants out of business.</p>
        <p>State regulators had indicated they would allow the new plant to take in more than four million gallons of water a day from the Hudson. But today, Mr. Cahill said that he would grant the plant a water permit that allowed it to use just 180,000 gallons daily. Some plants use more than one billion gallons a day, including the two active Indian Point nuclear reactors.</p>
        <p>''His decision to limit the water intake came as a significant surprise to us,'' said Chris Iribe, eastern region president of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric's National Energy Group. But, he said, ''we're confident we will go forward.''</p>
        <p>''This will add to the cost,'' he said, also saying that he did not know how much. ''It will somewhat increase air emissions because the project will be a little less efficient.''</p>
        <p>By setting the figure so low, environmentalists said, Mr. Cahill will force the Athens plant to use the latest cooling technology, with the least effect on fish. The low figure would also eliminate the need for the cooling towers and plumes of steam that are a visual signature for most plants.</p>
        <p>''This decision is a victory for the Hudson and sets a precedent with national implications,'' said Ned Sullivan, executive director of the environmental group Scenic Hudson.</p>
        <p>The permit granted by Mr. Cahill is widely seen as the last serious hurdle for the plant, barring a lawsuit. It still must be approved by a siting board controlled by the governor, and by the Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
        <p>The plant is the first approved in New York since the late 1980's. At a capacity of 1,080 megawatts -- 4 percent to 5 percent of average demand statewide -- it would have the largest output of any plant in the country. Applications have been filed for more than a dozen other power plants around the state, including many on or near the Hudson, and some in New York City.</p>
        <p>After last July's heat wave caused blackouts and brownouts across much of the Northeast, energy experts warned that the region -- in fact, much of the country -- was dangerously close to outstripping its power supply, and that it would take four or five years to build enough  plants to catch up to rising demand. New York City and Long Island are in particular danger, because there are too few transmission lines to greatly increase the amount of power imported from elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 10, 2000, Saturday  An article last Saturday about the Pataki administration's final approval for a single-unit power plant to be built in Athens, N.Y., misstated its size ranking. Experts say the Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona, which has three units, is the largest in the country, with a total capacity of 3,900 megawatts. The plant in Athens, with a capacity of 1,080 megawatts, is to be one of the largest in the United States fired by natural gas and one of the largest single-unit plants -- not the largest in the country.</p>
