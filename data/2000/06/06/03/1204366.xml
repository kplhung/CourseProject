        <p>Honored in this ancient European center for his service to European unity, President Clinton today urged America's European allies to invite Russia into their military and political unions.</p>
        <p>Standing under an unforgiving sun in the courtyard of the ninth-century cathedral where Charlemagne is buried and where many Holy Roman emperors and German kings were crowned, Mr. Clinton told an audience of several hundred people that to do otherwise would destroy the vision of an undivided Continent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton delivered his speech after he was given the Charlemagne Award, which is given to a world leader who furthers the cause of European unity.</p>
        <p>And in the spirit of unity on the eve of a two-day summit meeting in Moscow with President Vladimir V. Putin, he made clear that Russia deserved Europe's warm embrace.</p>
        <p>''We don't yet know if Russia's hard-won democratic freedoms will endure,'' Mr. Clinton said, citing the country's economic crisis and the war in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>But he envisioned a time when a prosperous, democratic Russia would be offered membership in NATO, the military alliance created a half-century ago to contain the Soviet threat, and in the 15-member European Union.</p>
        <p>''Because the stakes are so high, we must do everything we can to encourage a Russia that is fully democratic and united in its diversity; a Russia that defines its greatness not by dominance of its neighbors, but by the dominant achievements of its people and its partnership; a Russia that should be, indeed, must be, fully part of Europe,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>''That means no doors can be sealed shut to Russia -- not NATO's, not the E.U.'s,'' he said. ''The alternative would be a future of harmful competition.''</p>
        <p>He added that if Russia decided it did not want to join NATO and the European Union, then they must make sure that their eastward expansion does not create ''barriers to trade, travel and security cooperation'' with Russia.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has long said Russia could eventually become a member of NATO if it met the military alliance's stringent requirements. Up to now, Russia has shown no interest in joining.</p>
        <p>Since 1994, it has been a member of the interim Partnership for Peace, a sort of junior partnership in NATO that includes no military umbrella. In 1997, NATO and Russia signed an agreement that allows for additional consultations and cooperation.</p>
        <p>But neither Mr. Clinton nor the Europeans have ever suggested that Russia should join the European Union.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton characterized his views as part of larger strategy for the transformation of Russia from a hostile dictatorship to a friendly democracy that belongs to the West.</p>
        <p>''We must do everything we can to encourage a Russia that is fully democratic,'' he said. ''Though Russia's transformation is incomplete, there clearly is reason for hope in Russia's remarkable journey over these last few years -- from dictatorship to democracy.''</p>
        <p>He offered no blueprint on how to reach such ambitious goals. But this is the last scheduled trip to Europe in the his presidency, and Mr. Clinton was in a mood to be magnanimous.</p>
        <p>The gesture could also be seen as a symbolic peace offering to Moscow, defining Russia as a great power and potential partner as Mr. Clinton and Mr. Putin prepare for talks on such contentious issues as Washington's proposal to develop a limited missile defense system and Russia's prosecution of the war in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said the other essential task for the Europeans was to bring the Balkan region into the global mainstream. ''That is the only way to make peace last in that bitterly divided region,'' he said. ''Our goal must be to de-Balkanize the Balkans.''</p>
        <p>The president also challenged the image of the United States as a superpower bully with more power, money, military might and political will than Europe, and portrayed it instead as a close friend who wanted to pay his respects and clear up what he called ''potentially harmful misperceptions.''</p>
        <p>''There is a perception right now in America that Europe doesn't always carry its fair share of our mutual responsibilities,'' he said. As proof that the statement was untrue, he pointed out that Europeans were providing more than 80 percent of peacekeeping troops in Kosovo and of the money for economic reconstruction there. He also said Europeans paid for more than 60 percent of all aid to Central America after it was ravaged by Hurricane Mitch in 1998.</p>
        <p>''At the same time, there is a perception in Europe that America's power -- military, economic, cultural -- is at times too overbearing,'' Mr. Clinton added. He acknowledged that America's dominant military role in NATO's air campaign in Kosovo accentuated such fears.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton was welcomed to Aachen by Mayor Jurgen Linden and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder.</p>
        <p>Mr. Linden put a yellow-ribboned medallion over Mr. Clinton's head, as 10 other medallion-wearing recipients of the award, including President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic and King Juan Carlos of Spain, looked on from the makeshift stage.</p>
        <p>The setting was fitting for what may be Mr. Clinton's most comprehensive reflections on Europe in the final months of his presidency.</p>
        <p>Although Aachen, a western city a few miles from the Belgian and Dutch borders, was severely damaged during World War II, in 1944 it became the first German city to be  occupied by the United States. Today, it is a on the cutting edge of Europe's information economy.</p>
        <p>In honoring Mr. Clinton for his contributions to Europe, Mr. Schroder praised him for ''preserving, strengthening and further developing'' America's partnership in Europe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton becomes the third American, following former Secretaries of State George C. Marshall, the architect of the plan to rebuild Europe after World War II, and Henry A. Kissinger, to receive the award.</p>
        <p>The president said he would donate the $2,500 that comes with the award to a student exchange program between the sister cities of Aachen and Arlington, Va.</p>
