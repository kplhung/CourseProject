        <p>Jorge Chavez, the leading jockey in New York for six years, suffered bruises but no broken bones yesterday when his mount stumbled and threw him to the track in the second race at Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>Chavez, 38, of Peru, was thrown by St. Forlene, a 3-year-old filly owned by Virginia Kraft Payson and trained by James Bond. The filly was trying to maintain her lead in a pack of 12 horses as they turned into the homestretch when she buckled, flipping Chavez to the ground.</p>
        <p>The filly broke her front right ankle and was destroyed by injection.</p>
        <p>Chavez, who won the Eclipse award last year as the nation's outstanding rider, was taken to North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, where X-rays showed no fractures. He has a bruised thigh.</p>
