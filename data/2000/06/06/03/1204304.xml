        <p>In the din here in the old courtroom, lawyers fight for billions of dollars as the people in the gallery fight for air.</p>
        <p>With as much as $100 billion at risk in a lawsuit brought by Florida smokers against cigarette makers, lawyers argue hot and loud whether the tobacco companies should be punished with a huge judgment -- until the state court judge, tired of all the shouting, quiets them down.</p>
        <p>Then, in the lull, the survivors of a pack-a-day past can be heard.</p>
        <p>The sound of ruined lungs and surgically altered voices drifts softly across the pews in the Miami-Dade Courthouse. The hiss of oxygen bottles mixes with the tortured breaths of lifetime smokers, and men who suck air into their lungs through holes in their throats whisper hoarsely to women widowed by cancer.</p>
        <p>In the front pew, which he has occupied every court day for 22 months in various stages of the lawsuit, 62-year-old Guillermo Saa speaks through an electronic voice box. A white bib covers the hole surgeons left after cutting away part of his throat, his larynx and other cancerous tissue around his neck.</p>
        <p>With each breath, the bib gently rises and falls, rises and falls.</p>
        <p>The notion that their scars and surgeries and shortened lives might be partly their fault, that they could have quit, if they had truly tried, is not something these former smokers entertain for very long.</p>
        <p>''I tried to stop,'' Mr. Saa said  outside the courtroom, in his mechanical voice. ''The most I lasted was two or three days.''</p>
        <p>The former smokers and their friends and family members file into the courtroom every day, a dozen or so, sometimes more, and always sit in the first few rows on the right-hand side. These are mostly older people, who started smoking years before it was common knowledge that the habit could kill them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saa comes to see the trial, which is his own story, in a way, played out.</p>
        <p>He knew, long before his operation to remove the cancerous tissue in 1982, that smoking could kill him or ruin his life, but the habit, the pure pleasure it gave him, was overpowering, he said. Like others in this courtroom, he became hooked as a young man, before he knew of the long-term effects. When he did know smoking could kill him, quitting required more will than he possessed.</p>
        <p>He sits day by day beside people who know that craving.</p>
        <p>''I have pulmonary emphysema,'' said Valentin Venas, 72, of Miami. ''I cannot be cured.'' He started smoking when he was 12.</p>
        <p>But that is the way it is with smoking, people here said. If it does not ruin the quality of your life, as it did with Mr. Saa, it steals the end of it. The people in the first few pews are not the worst off of the 300,000 to 500,000 people who are joined in the lawsuit against five major cigarette makers. The worst off, under oxygen tents, cannot come to the courtroom.</p>
        <p>''I think there are more dead than living, still waiting,'' said Mr. Saa, who lives with his wife, Nancy, on Miami Beach. But he never goes into the ocean. He is afraid that the water will slip down the hole in his throat and drown him.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit they have come to monitor has already cost the cigarette industry $12.7 million in compensatory damages. The same jury in Miami-Dade Circuit Court is hearing the punitive stage, which is expected to continue for about another week, so the smokers are cautious but hopeful.</p>
        <p>They point out that many courts have already found cigarettes to be a dangerously addictive product, one designed to be so. One inch of small print on the side of a cigarette pack -- a warning easily overlooked, or ignored -- was flimsy protection from that, the smokers said.</p>
        <p>Carmen Ruiz, who came here from Puerto Rico, where smoking is almost a national pastime, comes to the trial and sits there, for her dead husband. ''In the middle of the night he would go to the bathroom, and then he would lie down and smoke,'' said Ms. Ruiz. Her husband, Francisco Ruiz, died from cancer in 1978. ''He would give up food, just to smoke more.''</p>
        <p>Each person here has a story of how easy it was to get started.</p>
        <p>''Smoking for me was by choice,'' said Mr. Saa, of the beginning of his habit. He was on an airplane flight from Colombia to Miami, in 1954. A flight attendant, he said, handed out sample packages with just three cigarettes inside. Three cigarettes.</p>
        <p>''I was hooked,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saa came to the United States to study English in Louisiana. He noticed that everywhere he looked, even the hallways of public buildings, there were cigarette vending machines.</p>
        <p>''Everyone smoked,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It was the culture. Movie stars who got the girl smoked. Women smoked -- but only sitting down. Even professional athletes smoked.</p>
        <p>''There weren't warnings,'' Mr. Saa said. ''In 1964, they started to give notice'' of the health risks of smoking. ''I already had the addiction,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Besides, he said, there was always the feeling that while it might happen to others, it could not really happen to him, the same feeling that people have driving past the scene of a bloody highway accident.</p>
        <p>''I never thought it would harm me this much,'' Mr. Saa said. ''I never thought I would get like this.''</p>
        <p>The tobacco companies countered the warnings with their own scientific data.</p>
        <p>Some taking part in the lawsuit say it is not about the money and some say that is exactly what it is about, forcing the tobacco companies to pay for ruined lives. But with as many as 500,000 joined in the lawsuit, even a $100 billion judgment would be spread pretty thin.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Saa said she and her husband lost everything to his medical bills, including their house.</p>
        <p>''Such a fatal life,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saa said there was one good thing about his ordeal. His children do not smoke. They look at him, and cannot. He talks to schoolchildren, to show them how dangerous it is to smoke, and the high price they could someday pay for trying to be cool.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the tobacco industry have argued that the modern-day executives have changed, that they recognize the dangers, that they have refused to aim advertisements at new smokers. That, the tobacco lawyers said, should be considered by the jury in any judgment of punitive damages.</p>
        <p>The former smokers in the courtroom shake their heads at that. The legacy of distrust is too strong.</p>
        <p>But smokers who have quit think that quitting, while painful, was possible, and that it has saved them -- at least for now.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's any innocent victims here,'' Donald Livingstone, 70, a lawyer and former smoker, said as he passed by the courtroom. ''All these people took the risk.''</p>
        <p>The terrible thing about quitting, some smokers said, is that a seed might have already been planted deep inside the body that flowers into death.</p>
        <p>''I quit at 55,'' Mr. Livingstone said. ''I knew my life would lose all its quality to it.'' But, he said, ''if I had a lethal diagnosis, I would probably light up.''</p>
