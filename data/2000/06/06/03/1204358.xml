        <p>Eleven years ago, when a plane carrying Representative Mickey Leland of Texas on a hunger relief mission  crashed in Ethiopia, Rodney Ellis, a young Democratic councilman in Houston, was grief stricken and shaken.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellis had not only lost his mentor, but he was also supposed to have been on that plane and had even fumed at Mr. Leland for bumping him from the trip.</p>
        <p>Urged by Mr. Leland's widow to run for his seat in Congress, Mr. Ellis  gave it some thought before deciding instead to seek the State Senate seat that Mr. Leland had once held.</p>
        <p>In the decade since then, Mr. Ellis has become perhaps the leading political force behind the decidedly unpopular efforts in Texas to slow the state's speedy executions and erase what he said were the inequities that often keep black, Hispanic and indigent defendants from a fair trial.</p>
        <p>It might seem an unusual role for a man who -- like almost every influential Texas politician -- supports the death penalty. But Mr. Ellis's deep reservations about the system, and his occasional clashes with Gov. George W. Bush, earned him the spotlight this week.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Bush campaigning in California and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, in Europe, Mr. Ellis, as the Senate president pro tem, became the acting governor and was left to decide whether to grant a reprieve for convicted murderer Ricky McGinn. Mr. Bush announced on Thursday in Sacramento that he had recommended a 30-day reprieve, which Mr. Ellis had accepted.</p>
        <p>But actually, Mr. Ellis had mostly made up his mind five days earlier, having conferred with his staff and read an order by a state judge imploring an appeals court to postpone the execution to allow DNA tests that defense lawyers said might exonerate Mr. McGinn of raping his 12-year-old stepdaughter. Mr. McGinn was convicted of murdering the girl, but prosecutors could not have asked for a death sentence without also getting the rape conviction.</p>
        <p>The case kept him awake until 3 a.m. Monday night, Mr. Ellis said, thinking, ''What if I disagree with Governor Bush? How would we resolve that?'' His wife told him to call Mr. Bush's aides first thing on Tuesday, which he did, so Mr. Bush would have the chance to return to Texas to make sure the execution was carried out.</p>
        <p>But to his surprise, Mr. Ellis said, Mr. Bush's aides said they were already seriously considering a reprieve.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Ellis, Mr. McGinn's case highlights only some of the problems with the state's criminal justice system. Mr. Ellis, 46, said it was outrageous that there was no legal process in place allowing the new DNA tests to be conducted, as the state's highest criminal appeals court, without explanation, refused to postpone the execution.</p>
        <p>In the Legislature, Mr. Ellis has advocated banning executions of the mentally retarded, giving juries the option of sentencing murderers to life without parole, thus making it easier for jurors to forgo the death penalty, and putting control of court-appointed lawyers in the hands of county governments and not the local judges who, he said, often favor lawyers who speed cases along instead of fighting tooth-and-nail for their client.</p>
        <p>That last proposal was vetoed by Mr. Bush because, Mr. Ellis said, judges worried that it took away a piece of their patronage. Mr. Bush said that power should be left to judges because they were better qualified to select lawyers for defendants who needed them.</p>
        <p>Texas courts, Mr. Ellis said, are ''essentially a system of judicial apartheid.''</p>
        <p>''Our focus tends to be on the law and order, lock them up, throw away of the key stuff, and a refusal to look at the inequities of the system,'' he said. ''Part of the problem is that our governor and a number of my conservative colleagues somehow have the view that if you show compassion, you can be perceived as weak.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, for his part, maintains that all 131 inmates executed while he has been governor were unquestionably guilty of murder and had had appropriate access to the courts. And few legislators share Mr. Ellis's view.</p>
        <p>''People commit crimes because of bad values, not because of their race or status,'' said State Senator David Sibley, a Waco Republican and  Bush ally.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Ellis may not be in sympathy with legislative leaders on some things, he has still been effective on many issues, including indigent health care and voter registration. He has earned a place among the elite of the State Senate, a institution where, Texas Monthly magazine once said, ''toughness is good, shrillness and criticism are not, and humor is essential.''</p>
        <p>''He knows how to put together coalitions,'' Mr. Sibley said, before adding: ''I don't think he's one that says half a loaf is better than none. He says, 'I'll take half a loaf now, and come back for the rest later.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sibley and Mr. Ellis have already discussed legislation that would make it easier for prisoners to obtain post-trial DNA testing that might prove exculpatory. Without commenting on specifics, Mr. Sibley said such legislation might stand a chance of passage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellis already has some specifics in mind: Giving inmates the right to get DNA testing of evidence from their case, requiring that biological evidence be preserved, setting up a commission to review and investigate cases of possible wrongful convictions, and providing more compensation to people wrongfully imprisoned and later exonerated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellis, the son of a yardman,  grew up in Houston, attended Texas Southern University, and earned a law degree and master's in public affairs at the University of Texas. After serving as Mr. Leland's chief of staff, he was elected to the Houston City Council at the age of 29. He now works in the Houston office of a New Orleans law firm, and is married with three children.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Bush and Mr. Perry both expected to travel out of state at times later this year, the final approval for executions could fall to Mr. Ellis again. One inmate scheduled to die soon, Gary Graham, has drawn a lot support from those who insist he is innocent. What would Mr. Ellis do if that case were left up to him? Not sure yet, he said, ''but if I were a guessing man, I would guess the governor or lieutenant governor will be in town.''</p>
