        <p>This 30-second commercial, titled ''Best,'' was released Thursday by former Gov. Jim Florio in his bid for the Democratic Senate nomination against Jon S. Corzine. The commercial is running on television stations in New York City and Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- The Campaign Group.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- At the sound of a whip crack, the commercial opens with grainy, colorless, slow-motion videotape of Mr. Corzine in an impromptu news conference with several microphones thrust before him. He is holding his left hand up, palm out toward the camera, in a way that makes him look uneasy and defensive. Headlines flash onscreen, obscuring his face: ''Your prying eyes,'' ''Corzine lawyer put detectives on Florio.'' The nameplates of The New York Times, The Star-Ledger and The Philadelphia Inquirer are shown against an outline of New Jersey and the words, ''Reject Jon Corzine.'' An editorial from The Record, in Hackensack, is quoted from beneath the headline, ''Buying an election.'' The ad cuts back to the tape of Mr. Corzine, now above a giant label, ''$35 million,'' and the appeal ''Show Jon Corzine New Jersey is not for sale.'' Finally, the newspaper logos are shown beneath The Inquirer's editorial headline, ''Democrats, vote Florio,'' and a quotation: ''Jim Florio is the better choice.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Narrator: ''Jon Corzine's campaign has sunk to a new low, using private detectives to spy on his opponent. Come on, Corzine. And that's why, from The Times and Star-Ledger in North Jersey, to The Inquirer in the South, newspapers are urging voters to reject Jon Corzine. The Record: 'Make no mistake about it, Corzine is trying to buy his way into the Senate.' Tuesday, show Jon Corzine New Jersey is not for sale. For Democrats, Jim Florio is the better choice for Senate.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The commercial accurately quotes from the newspaper articles and editorials it cites.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mr. Florio, trailing in the polls and outspent by more than 15 to 1, has done his best in the last week to make Mr. Corzine's record-shattering spending the overriding issue in their Senate contest.</p>
        <p>News accounts that have appeared in the past few days recounting Mr. Corzine's heavy-handed use of private investigators to explore Mr. Florio's background have been a boon to the Florio campaign, as have been endorsements by the largest newspapers circulating in New Jersey. This commercial wastes no time in exploiting such favorable publicity.</p>
