        <p>One question the Devils will have to answer now that the Stanley Cup finals are becoming more defensive is whether they can limit their turnovers. Turnovers by the Devils resulted in both Dallas goals on Thursday night in the Devils' 2-1 loss.</p>
        <p>Another question that demands the Devils' attention is whether to continue using their top line of Jason Arnott with Patrik Elias and Petr Sykora against Dallas's first line of Brett Hull, Mike Mondano and Jere Lehtinen. This Dallas threesome, playing against the Devils' top threesome, produced Hull's two goals that gave the Stars a triumph in Game 2 and evened the four-of-seven-game series at one victory each.</p>

        <p>One question the Devils will have to answer now that the Stanley Cup finals are becoming more defensive is whether they can limit their turnovers. Turnovers by the Devils resulted in both Dallas goals on Thursday night in the Devils' 2-1 loss.</p>
        <p>Another question that demands the Devils' attention is whether to continue using their top line of Jason Arnott with Patrik Elias and Petr Sykora against Dallas's first line of Brett Hull, Mike Mondano and Jere Lehtinen. This Dallas threesome, playing against the Devils' top threesome, produced Hull's two goals that gave the Stars a triumph in Game 2 and evened the four-of-seven-game series at one victory each.</p>
        <p>While Modano's line was effective at both ends of the ice in the second game of the series, Arnott's line, which produced four goals in the first game, was virtually nonexistent, especially Elias and Sykora. They were so ineffective that Coach Larry Robinson admitted today that he had thought about benching one of them during the game.</p>
        <p>''I kicked myself this morning,'' Robinson said this afternoon about his failure to break up the line. ''What I should have done was when I saw that they weren't as sharp, I should have probably broken that line up.''</p>
        <p>Alexander Mogilny scored the lone goal for the Devils, leaving Robinson second-guessing himself. ''I thought Mogilny had great legs and I should have moved him up because he was ready to go. I will take the blame because it was something I thought, but you always hope.''</p>
        <p>While Mogilny showed some spark, Robinson's top line never got going. Arnott, who performed the best of the three on the line, took the blame, while Elias and Sykora were not part of the five players the Devils made available to the news media today.</p>
        <p>The players who did talk today --  Arnott, Martin Brodeur, Scott Stevens, Claude Lemieux and Randy McKay -- appeared as if the loss had brought them back to earth after their 7-3 humiliation of the Stars in the opening game of the series.</p>
        <p>As in the previous two series, the Devils find themselves tied after the first two games.</p>
        <p>''When you have a little success, you think it's easy,'' Brodeur said. ''Now they have the momentum going into their building and we'll have to be afraid. We need to win one game there to get the advantage back.''</p>
        <p>Stevens said: ''We get a big victory, we dominate a game and have success, then we don't want to do the dirty work. Getting the puck in deep and chasing is dirty work. We talk about it until we're blue in the face and still don't go out and do it.''</p>
        <p>McKay, who has been without a goal in the Devils' 19 playoff games this year, had a couple of good chances late in the second and early in the third but he failed to capitalize. ''I've got to stay positive, otherwise it will get worse,'' he said.</p>
        <p>McKay said he was encouraged because the Devils played better on the road in the playoffs, where they have won seven of nine games.</p>
        <p>But the Stars have 9 victories in 10 playoff games this spring at Reunion Arena, which has the reputation of having terrible ice conditions. Robinson and Lemieux did not offer those conditions as an excuse.</p>
        <p>''The conditions are the same for both teams,'' Robinson said. ''When you start making excuses that the ice is not good and the boards are not right, you lose focus. What we have to do is play our game and we'll have success.''</p>
        <p>Lemieux, who has played a lot of games in Dallas as a member of the Colorado Avalanche because both teams are in the Western Conference, said: ''People make a big deal of the ice there. It's not different than anywhere else this time of the year.''</p>
