        <p>Two radiologists whose licenses were suspended by the state this week following accusations that the doctors administered faulty mammograms have a history of problems in their practices, according to state records and interviews with former medical associates.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the state health commissioner, Dr. Antonia C. Novello, asserted that Dr. Steven J. Bier and Dr. Mario DiBlasio improperly screened 9,000 to 11,000 poor women in the last five years in the Bronx for breast cancer, often billing for tests they did not provide.</p>
        <p>Dr. DiBlasio said in an interview Thursday that the state was unfairly maligning him, and that his previous problems with the law, including drug convictions, began when he became addicted to drugs after the death of his daughter.</p>
        <p>Dr. DiBlasio, who lives in Yonkers, first ran into trouble in 1985, when he was accused of improperly issuing prescriptions for narcotics and other types of drugs, Health Department records show.</p>
        <p>In State Supreme Court in Brooklyn in 1986, Dr. DiBlasio was convicted of possessing and selling narcotics and sentenced to 21 years to life in prison. The following year, the state revoked his license to practice medicine.</p>
        <p>But Dr. DiBlasio appealed his criminal convictions and the license revocation.</p>
        <p>Eventually, his conviction for selling drugs was overturned. At retrial, he was convicted of a less serious charge, possession of a controlled substance (cocaine), and  was released from jail in early 1992, state records show.</p>
        <p>From there, Dr. DiBlasio began the numerous appeals that led to the reinstatement of his medical license in 1995.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bier's past troubles stemmed from billing practices, said officials who once worked for an insurance carrier, Group Health Inc., that has an extensive network of doctors that had included Dr. Bier. In the early 1990's, a standard review of the doctors' practices revealed that Dr. Bier's bills were roughly $80,000 a year higher on average than other radiologists', and that he was ordering hundreds more tests than the others, said Harvey Schachter, the former vice president for professional affairs at G.H.I.</p>
        <p>''There were multiple sonograms on almost every patient he had seen,'' said Mr. Schachter, who is now the administrator for the employee health plan at St. Barnabas Medical Center in the Bronx. ''There was insufficient documentation to show that all the tests he billed for were ordered by referring physicians. He was the only radiologist who showed up that way.''</p>
        <p>Further, G.H.I. sent some of Dr. Bier's tapes of echocardiograms, which measure heart activity, to Dr. Malcolm Phillips, director of medicine at St. Barnabas, for a quality review. ''They were, to be kind, suboptimal,'' Dr. Phillips recalled. ''And conclusions were drawn that were not supported by what I saw.'' The insurance company dropped Dr. Bier because of these problems, Mr. Schachter said.</p>
        <p>But Jeffrey Rubin, Dr. Bier's lawyer, disputed that. ''It is not accurate that Dr. Bier was dropped by G.H.I.,'' Mr. Rubin said.  ''My understanding is that he resigned.'' He added that he knew nothing of the billing accusations made by the G.H.I. officials.</p>
        <p>Albert May, a spokesman for G.H.I., said Dr. Bier was ''terminated'' in 1995, but would not elaborate.</p>
        <p>A receptionist at Dr. Bier's office on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx said Thursday that he was not taking calls. She added: ''He will talk in due time. He is innocent until proven guilty. Everything written about him is lies.''</p>
        <p>At her news conference this week, Dr. Novello said that for five years, Dr. Bier and Dr. DiBlasio, whom Dr. Bier had hired to work with him, screened women for breast cancer through a state and federally financed program called Healthy Women Partnership. Almost all of the tests were faulty, Dr. Novello said, and the doctors often billed the state for tests they did not provide. The state has accused the doctors of gross negligence and incompetence, and they await a formal disciplinary hearing.</p>
        <p>The state will provide new free tests to the women through various hospitals in the Bronx. This week, St. Barnabas set up a mobile mammogram van outside Dr. Bier's office to serve patients.</p>
        <p>Dr. DiBlasio's lawyer, Scott Einiger, said his client was providing consulting services to Dr. Bier for only a year and a half, and was not involved in the billing. ''At the time of the hearing, I am sure our client will be fully exonerated,'' Mr. Einiger said.</p>
        <p>Dr. DiBlasio said in an interview this week that he did not understand why the Health Department was taking action against him.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, he was accused of writing dozens of prescriptions for various drugs, at times failing to keep records for the patients who were said to be receiving the prescriptions. In at least one case, state records indicated, he prescribed 900 tablets of drugs to a ''person who was an addict or habitual user of controlled substances.''</p>
        <p>Dr. DiBlasio said those prescriptions were written for his own use. He added that he had an addiction to drugs that stemmed from the death of his young daughter from leukemia, and that he had never harmed patients. ''After the loss of my daughter in 1980, I went nuts and I lost my mind,'' he said. ''Please don't make me talk about it. It was a horror story. And I have no idea what the state wants from me. I am only marginally involved with that office. I am not his partner. I did have a drug problem 20 years ago but it is ancient history and has been resolved.''</p>
        <p>While waiting for his license to be restored, Dr. DiBlasio said, he worked as a drug counselor. ''The road to recovery was long,'' he said. ''But I always wanted to practice medicine. Medicine is my life and my heart.''</p>
        <p>State Health Department records detail a long inquiry that preceded the reinstatement of Dr. DiBlasio's license. According to state records, an investigative committee found that the doctor had been drug-free for years and that he had made serious efforts at continuing his education in radiology.</p>
        <p>''It is also clear from the record,'' the committee's report stated in 1994, that Dr. DiBlasio was ''remorseful over the actions that resulted in the loss of his license and that he has made efforts to give back to the community the benefit of his counseling through his work over the last three years in counseling individuals on substance abuse.''</p>
        <p>The prosecutor who worked on the final trial, William LaVelle, who is now in private practice, said he remembered Dr. DiBlasio as someone who bought and sold drugs while seeing patients, and who was less than forthcoming when questioned about his drug use and sales. ''There was plenty in his file to show you that you would never want this guy treating you,'' Mr. LaVelle said.</p>
        <p>Dr. DiBlasio's case underscores the difficulty faced by state investigators in deciding the fate of a doctor: how long must a doctor with proven clinical skills pay for a mistake, and how can the state decide whether a threat to patients still exists?</p>
        <p>''You are obligated to be open to the possibility that situations can in fact be resolved,'' said Dr. Mark Chassin, a former state health commissioner who is a professor of health policy at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''But it requires a very wise and flexible process. At the end of the day it is about removing the ability of a physician to practice medicine, and on the other side it is about protecting the public from egregiously bad medical practices, and both of those decisions are of great consequence and cannot be undertaken lightly or by anybody but the most qualified we can bring to bear.''</p>
