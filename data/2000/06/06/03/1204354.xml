        <p>An international human rights group today challenged the Russian government to seek out and try the Russian servicemen who went on a rampage near Grozny on Feb. 5, killing at least 60 civilians.</p>
        <p>The atrocity, which was first reported on within weeks, is believed to be the worst of the latest Chechen war.</p>
        <p>In a report that documents the massacre and the pillaging that followed, Human Rights Watch called on Russian authorities to pursue a vigorous investigation into what happened in a Grozny suburb, Novye Aldi.</p>
        <p>Released on the eve of President Clinton's arrival in Moscow, the report comes as a rebuke to President Vladimir V. Putin, who has made repeated promises to pursue reports of war crimes.</p>
        <p>''The Russian government has not undertaken any serious investigation,'' said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for two Russian officials in charge of various investigations in Chechnya could not be reached for comment today. Vladimir Kalamanov, the Kremlin's special envoy for human rights, has said that his team has received corroborating evidence of atrocities in Novye Aldi.</p>
