      <abstract>
        <p>Judge Roger D Randall blocks Newhall Land and Farming Co from proceeding with 22,000-home planned community in Los Angeles County on border with Ventura County until it can assure court that there is enough water for the project, called Newhall Ranch, and conduct more detailed reviews of project's effect on traffic and environment; ruling will delay project at least until 2003 (M)</p>

        <p>In a decision that reflects the importance of water and environmental concerns for California's rapid growth, a state court judge has temporarily blocked construction of the single largest housing development ever approved by Los Angeles County, a 22,000-home planned community on the Ventura County border.</p>

        <p>In a decision that reflects the importance of water and environmental concerns for California's rapid growth, a state court judge has temporarily blocked construction of the single largest housing development ever approved by Los Angeles County, a 22,000-home planned community on the Ventura County border.</p>
        <p>In a ruling late Wednesday, Judge Roger D. Randall of Superior Court in neighboring Kern County ordered the developer, the Newhall Land and Farming Company, to prove that it can assure adequate water for its planned project, Newhall Ranch.  Judge Randall also ordered the developer to conduct more detailed reviews of the project's effect on traffic and the environment.</p>
        <p>Ventura County and a coalition of environmental groups had sued Newhall and Los Angeles County to block the project; the case was moved to Kern County to avoid a conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, the ruling means construction on the project will be delayed until 2003, a year after its scheduled start, said a spokeswoman for Newhall Land, Marlee Lauffer. The project's opponents said they hoped the delay and the requirements for further environmental reviews might lead to a scaling down of the plan, which Newhall had already shrunk from 25,000 units in a successful effort to win the approval of Los Angeles County last year.</p>
        <p>''We're hoping that the delays this causes will maybe cause them to take a harder look at the project and find some ways to reach more compromise,'' said Lynne Plambeck, vice president of the Santa Clarita Organization for Planning and Development, which joined the suit with the Sierra Club and a group called Friends of the Santa Clara River. ''I think we have a lot of hope.''</p>
        <p>Newhall Ranch, to be built over 20 years, has generated significant debate. But big as it is, it would barely make a dent in Los Angeles County's total projected need for new housing, now estimated at about 25,000 units a year.</p>
        <p>County officials said they would have to review the ruling before deciding whether to appeal it. Ms. Lauffer, the Newhall spokeswoman, said that ''we think, based on our initial review, that we can resolve these issues over the next year,'' adding that the ruling seemed to turn on ''relatively minor issues that the judge has requested additional analysis on.''</p>
        <p>But Antonette B. Cordero, an assistant county counsel for Ventura County, which has adopted some of the nation's most stringent measures to control growth, said that ''the judge is not just saying they have to generate more paper on this project, he's saying they have to go out and do some more analysis.''</p>
        <p>Specifically, Judge Randall held that Newhall must demonstrate that ''adequate water sources are available for build-out of the project,'' especially in dry years, Ms. Cordero said. The judge also required the developer to do more studies of the environmental and traffic effects of the project in Ventura County, where it has extensive holdings but does not currently plan to build, and on the Santa Clara River.</p>
        <p>''I can't speculate on what changes they may have to make once they go back and do that,'' Ms. Cordero said.</p>
        <p>But, in a significant victory for Los Angeles County and Newhall, the judge rejected Ventura County's argument that it was entitled to joint approval over the whole project.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 13, 2000, Tuesday  An article on June 3 about a state court decision blocking construction of Newhall Ranch, a planned development of 22,000 homes near Los Angeles, misstated part of the name of an environmental group that opposed the project. It is the Santa Clarita Organization for Planning and the Environment, not Planning and Development.</p>
