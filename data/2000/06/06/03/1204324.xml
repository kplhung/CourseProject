        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has come up with a plan that his aides say will make it easier for the contributors to his now-defunct campaign for the United States Senate to give their money to the new Republican candidate, Representative Rick A. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's campaign will send cashier's checks to the contributors, along with a letter from the mayor urging them to endorse the checks over to Mr. Lazio's campaign. A stamped envelope addressed to Mr. Lazio's campaign headquarters will be included in the mailing, to make things even easier.</p>

        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has come up with a plan that his aides say will make it easier for the contributors to his now-defunct campaign for the United States Senate to give their money to the new Republican candidate, Representative Rick A. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's campaign will send cashier's checks to the contributors, along with a letter from the mayor urging them to endorse the checks over to Mr. Lazio's campaign. A stamped envelope addressed to Mr. Lazio's campaign headquarters will be included in the mailing, to make things even easier.</p>
        <p>The contributions in question amount to just under $3 million. Bruce J. Teitelbaum, who managed Mr. Giuliani's campaign, said that no decision had been made about how Mr. Giuliani would dispose of another $3 million or so, out of $20 million raised, that will remain in the campaign fund.</p>
        <p>Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, said, ''They're doing everything they can to help, and we're very appreciative.''</p>
