        <p>With today's last match even at one set apiece and Gustavo Kuerten suffering from a sore back, it looked as if Michael Chang, the only American man left in the third round here, had a fine chance to be the only American man in the fourth round.</p>
        <p>But Kuerten, the loose-limbed Brazilian who is the favorite here, had other plans. Soon, it was Chang who was suffering, feeling cramps coming in his legs and watching helplessly as his final forehand sailed wide after his strings broke.</p>

        <p>With today's last match even at one set apiece and Gustavo Kuerten suffering from a sore back, it looked as if Michael Chang, the only American man left in the third round here, had a fine chance to be the only American man in the fourth round.</p>
        <p>But Kuerten, the loose-limbed Brazilian who is the favorite here, had other plans. Soon, it was Chang who was suffering, feeling cramps coming in his legs and watching helplessly as his final forehand sailed wide after his strings broke.</p>
        <p>''Obviously I would have loved to have done better here, but step by step and little by little, we'll keep plugging away,'' Chang said after Kuerten's 6-3, 6-7 (9), 6-1, 6-4 victory.</p>
        <p>For only the second time in the 32 years of open tennis, no American man has reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam event. The first time it happened was two years ago in this same grueling tournament. Not that the Americans should complain. They have won their share here in recent years: Chang won at age 17 in 1989, Jim Courier in 1991 and in 1992 and Andre Agassi last year.</p>
        <p>''Generally, the French is the one that Americans tend to struggle with the most, but ironically we've had four Americans win here in the past 11 years,'' Chang said.</p>
        <p>This year the only Americans left in contention are women, and two of them reached the fourth round in straight sets today. First was Chanda Rubin, who eliminated but hardly upset the No. 7-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France, 6-4, 7-6 (3). Tauziat's recently published work on women's tennis is selling briskly here, but the book on her as a player is that she loses her nerve on clay. Rubin will next face Natasha Zvereva of Belarus. Monica Seles, the No. 3-seeded woman, needed only 48 minutes to defeat Rita Kuti Kis, an overmatched Hungarian baseliner, 6-1, 6-2. But then Seles has been overmatching players of late, putting her downsized racket and upgraded fitness to ferocious use. She won the Italian Open last month and has lost only eight games in her first three matches here.</p>
        <p>''Definitely I feel really good out there,'' she said. ''I've been moving well, trying to improve upon that. I've been doing a lot better with getting to balls, just getting in better position to hit the ball.''</p>
        <p>It will get tougher, however. If all goes according to seeding, Seles would have to beat France's Amelie Mauresmo, France's (and Ohio's) Mary Pierce and Martina Hingis of Switzerland just to reach the final.</p>
        <p>First comes Mauresmo, whom Seles beat in the Italian Open final and who has been playing impressively here.</p>
        <p>''I think both of us are playing some fantastic tennis coming into the tournament,'' Seles said. ''It's unfortunate that we have to meet each other so early really.''</p>
        <p>While Seles pushes forward, her friend Lindsay Davenport is scheduled to leave Paris for California on Saturday to begin racing the clock to get ready to defend her Wimbledon title. Muscle spasms in her back caused her considerable pain in her first-round loss to Dominique Van Roost and forced her to withdraw from the women's doubles event today in which she was seeded first with Corina Morariu.</p>
        <p>Davenport's agent, Tony Godsick, said she planned to ''rest for a few days, see how it feels and maybe play a warm-up tournament on grass before Wimbledon.''</p>
        <p>Kuerten's back has also caused him trouble this year, and with Chang leading by 3-2 in the second set, he called for the same trainer, Per Bastholt, who treated Agassi's foot blisters during his second-round loss to Karol Kucera.</p>
        <p>He received treatment again midway through the third set, but by then he was in control of the match. By the time it ended after three hours of often sensational baseline play, Kuerten was still the favorite and Chang was still struggling to regain his former stature.</p>
