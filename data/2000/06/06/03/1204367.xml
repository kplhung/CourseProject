        <p>Two generations after the end of legal discrimination, race still ignites political debates -- over Civil War flags, for example, or police profiling. But the wider public discussion of race relations seems muted by a full-employment economy and by a sense, particularly among many whites, that the time of large social remedies is past. Race relations are being defined less by political action than by daily experience, in schools, in sports arenas, in pop culture and at worship, and especially in the workplace.</p>
        <p>These encounters -- race relations in the most literal, everyday sense -- will be the subject of a series of reports, the outcome of a yearlong examination by a team of reporters. Tomorrow, in Part 1: A look at the inner and outer lives of a multiracial congregation.</p>
