        <p>In 1997, two Israeli Army helicopters collided on the way to Lebanon, killing 73 soldiers as they crashed in the front yard of the school that Rachel Ben Dor's children attended. At the time, Ms. Ben Dor's oldest son was a soldier in Lebanon, and several of his former classmates, recent graduates like him, died.</p>
        <p>That pushed Ms. Ben Dor, an opponent of what she saw as Israel's senseless involvement in Lebanon, over the edge. Summoning three friends to her kitchen in a northern kibbutz, she hatched a group eventually called the Four Mothers -- Leave Lebanon in Peace.</p>
        <p>For years the military and political establishment dismissed them as overly emotional and ignorant of security concerns. But later, after they spawned a significant antiwar movement, they were derided on a baser level. An army commander crudely insulted them using a slur for women earlier this year, but in a signal of how the tide had turned, he was pressed to apologize.</p>
        <p>Today the Four Mothers met with Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who last week completed the unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon that they had pushed for.</p>
        <p>The women once called traitors were embraced by the nation's most decorated former general, and the whole issue came full circle, dizzyingly for them.</p>
        <p>''There we were inside the Defense Ministry that we used to picket, kissing and hugging with the prime minister and the army chief,'' said Ms. Ben Dor, 42. ''And all the generals were standing there, thinking I don't know what. It was so amazing.''</p>
        <p>Many Israelis celebrated the Four Mothers this week. The Jerusalem Post today called them ''one of the most successful grass-roots movements in Israeli history.'' The women took a classic Israeli stereotype -- the silent, suffering soldier's mother -- stood it on its head and dared to challenge the military.</p>
        <p>''From the beginning it was so shocking to the Israeli public that it was mothers who were demanding answers from the government,'' said Linda Ben Zvi, a leading member but not one of the original four. ''Mothers were supposed to make the schnitzel and hand-wash the uniforms and play the passive role inbred in Israeli society.''</p>
        <p>During the early 1980's, large antiwar rallies challenged Israel's invasion of Lebanon. But then the country fell largely silent for more than a decade. Israel's occupation of a what it called a ''security zone'' in southern Lebanon, with an annual death toll of 25 to 35 Israeli soldiers, became a reality that seemed immutable.</p>
        <p>The helicopter crash sent a spasm of doubt through the country.</p>
        <p>''It was like a sign from the skies, telling us the whole thing had to be stopped,'' said Ms. Ben Dor, a teacher and mother of three sons. ''For many, many nights afterward, people who had sons in the army didn't sleep. They were waiting for the devil to come knocking at their door.</p>
        <p>''In Israel we are all the time thinking that the army knows what it is doing, and sometimes we have to think twice. Someone should say this is crazy, I decided. It was crazy to educate our children to be decent and then at 18 send them places to kill the other people. We should send our children to die because our leaders can't solve our problems by talking?</p>
        <p>''And on a more specific level, the army's plan wasn't working. If they were in Lebanon to protect northern Israel, why were the Katyusha rockets falling on us?''</p>
        <p>The women began with small street protests at traffic junctions. They wrote letters to lawmakers. They organized debates at northern kibbutzim.</p>
        <p>After the first story about them appeared on national television, they received calls from all over the country. Working women all, they found themselves at the vanguard of a movement, without any organization, time or money. And they knew that what they were doing would take all that plus endurance.</p>
        <p>It also took its toll on their families. One mother quit when her soldier son demanded it. Ms. Ben Zvi had a hard time figuring out how to react when her son, Or, won a medal for his fighting in Lebanon. He asked her whether she was proud. And with difficulty she told him she was, because ''his reality was the war'' and she had raised him to excel at whatever he did.</p>
        <p>On talk shows, the mothers were placed opposite generals who patted them on the shoulders and rolled their eyes when the women spoke.</p>
        <p>''It was a tremendous miscalculation,'' said Ms. Ben Zvi, a professor. Eventually the military understood that the women were shaping national opinion and began to attack their movement as bad for the morale of the soldiers and the country.</p>
        <p>But it was too late. The Israeli news media loved the mothers, and the public appreciated the way they memorialized every soldier who died.</p>
        <p>Understanding the shift in public sentiment, the three leading candidates for prime minister in the last election promised to bring the boys home from Lebanon. Mr. Barak, who took office last July, made it a pledge with a date: by July 7, 2000, he said.</p>
        <p>Today, in imitation of a military custom, Ms. Ben Dor pinned a medal on Mr. Barak's chest -- with force. It was a Four Mothers button.</p>
        <p>The mothers, who will meet on Saturday to vote on whether to put themselves out of business as an organization, do not need it anymore.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 7, 2000, Wednesday  An article on Saturday about the Four Mothers, a group formed to promote Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, referred incorrectly at one point to the mother of Or Ben Dor, who earned a medal in combat there. She is Rachel Ben Dor; Linda Ben Zvi is another member of the organization.</p>
