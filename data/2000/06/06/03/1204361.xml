        <p>World Pride Roma, a global gay pride festival, is expected to draw gays from all over the world to Rome on July 1 for a week's worth of conferences, fashion shows, a gay pride parade, and a concert featuring Gloria Gaynor and The Village People.</p>
        <p>The Vatican, which is host to Holy Year events for religious pilgrims at the same time, is not amused.</p>
        <p>But when the Roman Catholic Church sought this week to block the World Pride event, it inadvertently turned it into one of the most politically charged -- and closely watched -- events on Rome's Jubilee calendar. The clash between the Vatican and World Pride organizers has noisily spilled over into national -- and even international -- politics and has filled newspaper front pages, talk shows and parliamentary debate.</p>
        <p>Italy's center-right opposition, gearing up for elections next year, has molded the timing of the gay event into a political bludgeon, deepening divisions within the already frayed center-left government.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, breaking with his predecessor, Massimo d'Alema, and some of his own cabinet members, chimed in last week, saying the scheduling of a gay event during a Jubilee was ''inopportune.''</p>
        <p>The furor drove one cabinet official to come out of the closet. Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio, Italy's minister of agricultural policy, said in the current issue of the weekly magazine Panorama that he is bisexual, a rare breach of privacy that he said was inspired by what he considered the unjust attacks on gay pride events.</p>
        <p>But the politician who has drawn the most fire is Rome's liberal mayor, Francesco Rutelli, who first welcomed the World Pride event, then this week withdrew the city's support, alienating many within his own center-left constituency while failing to appease the church.</p>
        <p>By stepping forward, then back, Mr. Rutelli helped make the World Pride event into an international cause celebre.</p>
        <p>''They advertised it far better than we ever could,'' Leigh Christopher, an organizer from San Francisco, said at the World Pride offices in the Mario Miele Center, an Italian gay rights association. Organizers say they are expecting as many as 300,000 to attend.</p>
        <p>The decision to hold the World Pride festival in Rome was made in 1997, although some in the organization argued that the event should be held in a city better known for gay rights, like Amsterdam or New York. But the lure of Rome during a Jubilee of the Roman Catholic Church, which condemns homosexual acts as sinful, won out. ''There was a compelling argument for the opportunity provided by a Jubilee year to open discussion on religion and homophobia,'' said Deborah Oakley-Melvin, a former president of the San Francisco Gay Pride association who is helping organize the Rome event. The response was worse, and therefore better, than she had expected.</p>
        <p>With ill-masked delight, Ms. Oakley-Melvin said, ''this is turning into another Stonewall,'' a reference to the 1969 uprising of gays against a police raid on the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. That event was considered the beginning of the modern gay-rights movement in the United States.</p>
        <p>But in Italy, a country that never had anti-homosexual legislation, even under Mussolini, gay rights has not had the political or social resonance found in the United States or Germany. It never experienced a Stonewall riot.</p>
        <p>''Italy is a classic example of a Catholic country -- everyone does everything, but the important thing is not to say it,'' said Massimo Consoli, a historian of gay rights.</p>
        <p>''Italian homosexuals never had to fight the kind of government repression found in other countries, so there has never been a strong gay movement here -- until now.'' He added, ''The Vatican is giving us a visibility that nobody has accorded us in centuries.''</p>
        <p>The church was first to express dismay over the propriety of holding a gay pride festival during a Holy Year. Cardinal Camillo Ruini, president of the Italian Conference of Bishops, complained publicly in January. He was soon followed by Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican secretary of state. ''The authorities know that Rome is a Holy City,'' Cardinal Sodano said.</p>
        <p>Vatican officials and some political leaders worried that, among other things, the gay festival would attract drag pontiffs to the streets of Rome. But the Amato government's desire to curb the gay event has incurred the wrath of many groups, including Italian Jews. ''We Jews are really sorry about this debate against homosexuals,'' Amos Luzzatto, president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, told the Roman newspaper Il Messaggero. He said he wanted to express solidarity with homosexuals sent by the Nazis to death camps alongside Jews.</p>
        <p>Few politicians, right or left, have expressed outright homophobia, insisting that the timing of the gay pride event is the problem. But conservative politicians who fiercely oppose the city's being host to a gay festival during the Jubilee have not warmed to Prime Minister Amato's efforts to distance himself from the event.</p>
        <p>''He cannot wash his hands of it,'' Silvano Moffa, president of the province of Rome, and a member of the right-wing party, National Alliance, said of Mr. Amato. ''In this Jubilee, Amato is turning into the Pontius Pilate of the year 2000.''</p>
        <p>Thursday night, representatives of the Christian Democratic Center, a small center-right opposition party, held a protest rally against the World Pride festival, showing cautionary video clips of a recent San Francisco gay pride event that featured men dressed as nuns, ''The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.'' Only a few dozen people showed up.</p>
        <p>After the Vatican made its feelings known, Mayor Rutelli asked organizers in February to postpone their festival for a week, arguing that the parade, fashion show, and other outdoor events could conflict with religious Jubilee events. ''There was no pressure from the church,'' Mr. Rutelli explained in an interview. ''There was opposition from the church.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Oakley-Melvin said the organizers refused to change their schedule, having already unilaterally decided not to begin the festival the last week in June, which is the anniversary of the Stonewall riots, but which also coincides with the June 29 feast day of SS. Peter and Paul, a Roman holiday. They also canceled a planned drag queen contest to spare Roman sensibilities.</p>
        <p>''Its just a provocation,'' she said. ''They didn't think we would respond in any other way than 'yes.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rutelli said he was outraged by what he described as an uncooperative attitude by the event's organizers. ''I didn't tell them not to do it, I just asked them to postpone it by just one week,'' the mayor said. He said that the $150,000 the city pledged to help pay for cultural events within the festival would instead go to cover municipal expenses, such as police protection and trash removal. And the organizers would no longer be allowed to display the city logo. ''The event will take place,'' he added, ''but without city sponsorship.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rutelli, who publicly urged the organizers to spare the feelings of ''an aging pope,'' said he had sought a postponement because the week of July 1 includes several important Jubilee events, including a Polish pilgrimage.</p>
        <p>''The World Pride rally is complicated and delicate because there is going to be a Jubilee with 200,000 Polish pilgrims,'' he said. ''Rome is a free and open city, but there is also a question of public order.''</p>
        <p>The Rev. Stanislaw Heymo, a Dominican priest who organizes all Polish pilgrimages, said that in fact, fewer than 50,000 Poles would come to Rome on July 6 and 7, and would hold an evening prayer meeting at the Colosseum on July 7, the same evening as the festival's ''Leather World Pride Party.'' He was not pleased by the coincidence.</p>
        <p>''This is a very bad thing,'' he complained. ''It would be better to spend money on the poor and immigrants, because homosexuals are rich, from rich families. They do nothing other than travel throughout the world, flaunting their sickness.''</p>
