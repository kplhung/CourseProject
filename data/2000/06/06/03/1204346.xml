      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Federal Aviation Administration threatened today to shut down major maintenance overhauls at Alaska Airlines, which would ground the airline within months.</p>
        <p>The agency, its attention drawn to the airline by a fatal crash last January and a federal grand jury investigation, said that the carrier had a persistent problem in keeping track of whether required maintenance had been done, and that managers had not noticed the problem.</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. gave the airline, a unit of Alaska Air Group, seven days to show why its maintenance hangars should not be shut down, and said that unless it was persuaded, it would order a shutdown 30 days after that.</p>
        <p>The proposed order to shut the airline's maintenance hangars was highly unusual. Although the agency has occasionally gone even further, simply grounding carriers, it seldom threatens such tough action against carriers as big as Alaska, which has a fleet of 89 jets and flies up and down the West Coast and to Hawaii, Canada and Mexico.</p>
        <p>But the agency's director of flight standards service, Nick Lacey, said the lapses, 150 cases over three years, were worrisome.</p>
        <p>''Aviation accidents come as a result of a series of small errors and inability to detect small errors,'' Mr. Lacey said, speaking to reporters here a few minutes after the airline was notified of the proposal.</p>
        <p>While no unsafe conditions were found that were attributable to the maintenance problems, an airline that cannot spot its own problems and correct them ''lacks the required redundancy,'' Mr. Lacey said.</p>
        <p>Asked if the problems were merely paperwork, he responded, ''Paperwork, that's kind of a trite word.''</p>
        <p>''Paperwork is very important,'' he continued. ''It's basically the way the airline assures that the work has been completed and performed.''</p>
        <p>The airline's chairman, John Kelly, said in a news conference at the company's Seattle headquarters that the company had begun remedying its problems, as the F.A.A. pointed them out. Mr. Kelly made public a list of veteran aviation safety specialists the company had hired recently, among 70 new maintenance and engineering employees, and described new procedures that were being followed before planes were released to carry passengers.</p>
        <p>The chairman portrayed the F.A.A. announcement as a demand that the changes already in the works be put on a firm timetable, and that they be made permanent. ''I don't blame them,'' he said, promising to comply.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly said that the F.A.A. had found 166 gaps in the paperwork, but he noted that 267,000 documents had been reviewed. That meant the airline had made errors on 0.06 percent of the documents, he said.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Lacey, speaking in Washington, said the company's cooperation, generally good safety record and skilled personnel were a factor in deciding not to ground the planes at once.</p>
        <p>The existence of longstanding lapses at the carrier is bad news for the F.A.A. as well as the airline.</p>
        <p>The agency has been struggling to improve its oversight of airlines since the crash of a ValuJet DC-9 in May 1996, and has invested heavily in new inspection systems.</p>
        <p>What led to the discovery of what Mr. Lacey called ''sloppiness'' at Alaska was not the perceptions of its inspectors or the systems put in place by F.A.A. management, but the crash in January of one of the company's MD-80 aircraft, and a continuing grand jury investigation into maintenance practices at the airline's hangar in Oakland, Calif.</p>
        <p>Until a final decision is made, F.A.A. inspectors are functioning as quality-control personnel for the airline, Mr. Lacey said. He added that inspectors who tracked down the aircraft at airports around Alaska Airlines' extensive route network found in all cases that the work had been performed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lacey said he could not comment on the Jan. 31 crash of the MD-80, which was en route from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco, because that investigation was in the hands of the National Transportation Safety Board. That crash has raised questions about whether the airline's maintenance and operational practices might have played a role.</p>
        <p>All 88 people on board were killed when the pilots lost control of the plane's pitch.</p>
        <p>Pulling wreckage from the coast off Los Angeles, investigators found the thread stripped from a jack screw, a device like a garage door opener, which moves the horizontal section of the tail up and down. A subsequent inspection of jack-screw assemblies in planes nationwide found a high incidence of problems on Alaska Airlines planes, which might be signs of a maintenance problem.</p>
        <p>The airline flies mostly Boeing 737's and MD-80's. At any given time, five or six of its planes are in hangars at Oakland or Seattle for heavy maintenance. Without the authority to release those planes back into service, ''you basically have a shrinking airline,'' Mr. Lacey said.</p>
        <p>The airline could not contract out the work, although it could lease planes from others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lacey said he hoped that the airline and his agency would reach agreement on a plan to correct the management deficiencies and that the airline could show that the plan was working, before the agency shut the hangars.</p>
        <p>The inspectors reviewed other aspects of the airline but did not find major problems, he said.</p>
        <p>He acknowledged that there were areas needing improvement; for example, pilots are supposed to be retrained annually but are allowed a one-month grace period. Alaska Airlines conducts 80 percent of its recurrent training in that 13th month, Mr. Lacey said.</p>
        <p>The stock market reacted unfavorably to today's announcement;  shares of the airline closed at $30.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, down $1.1875. But analysts said it was still a sound company.</p>
        <p>''They have a bona fide franchise,'' said Kevin C. Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who added, ''Their raison d'etre is to be the north-south operator on the West Coast, and that ain't too shabby.''</p>
        <p>''I think this will give them the kind of shock therapy they need to make sure they exceed F.A.A. standards,'' Mr. Murphy said.</p>
        <p>He and others noted that Alaska Airlines had pioneered safer navigation techniques, along with automated kiosks at airports that dispense tickets, and that it was experimenting with having passengers check their own luggage.</p>
        <p>''If Alaska Airlines isn't here next year, it will be because they were bought by another airline, not because of safety,'' Mr. Murphy said.</p>
        <p>In the wake of a proposed merger between United Airlines and US Airways, analysts have suggested that Alaska could find itself a takeover target by a larger carrier.</p>
