        <p>Patrick Ewing, as usual, was seated at his locker with his feet stuffed into buckets of ice. Allan Houston poked around his locker, surveying the accumulation of the Knicks' year. And Marcus Camby's locker was stripped completely bare, a bent hanger and the nameplate the only evidence that it had been used at all last night.</p>
        <p>Camby was already gone, having dressed and departed before the questions started. He chose to explain his absence in the postgame locker room at another time, rather talk about his disappearance on the floor.</p>
        <p>Whether it was the nagging pain of a sprained right knee or simply a game plan that took away the freedom to fly through the lane, Camby  contributed almost nothing as the Knicks' season ended with a 93-80 loss to the Indiana Pacers at Madison Square Garden last night.</p>
        <p>Camby, who finished with six rebounds and no points, was not alone in his aches or his invisibility. Houston scored only 2 points in the second half, finishing with 10 on 5-of-15 shooting. Larry Johnson, who might have been the most pained of the Knicks quartet of question marks, had 7 points on 3-of-10 shooting.</p>
        <p>Ewing, who finished with 18 points and 12 rebounds, and Sprewell, who shot 26 times on his way to a 32-point night, shrugged off their injuries and put up numbers, but found little help anywhere else.</p>
        <p>Yesterday morning, following the Knicks' final workout, Camby spoke of how the sprained medial capsule in his right knee, reinjured in Game 3, had grounded him. With his silence after the game, Camby made no excuses, and his teammates refused to provide one.</p>
        <p>''That would be the easy way out,'' Chris Childs said of the injury alibi. ''But it had nothing to do with injuries. We were injured going into the Miami series. We were injured the two games that we had at home that we won. That's the easy way out. Indiana just played better than us.</p>
        <p>''They had a chip on their shoulder from us beating them last year. It carried over into this series. They were more determined to win. It showed by the way they played, the confidence they had. Whenever they were down against us they believed. That's what it is, the desire and heart to do something. If you have that you can do it.''</p>
        <p>If desire was all it took, the Knicks might still be playing. Camby certainly wanted to get untracked after drifting aimlessly through the series.</p>
        <p>He went onto the court with the belief that if, by sheer force of will, he wished hard enough, he could fly, not like a character in a child's fairy tale, but the way he did a year ago. But his solitary moments came and failed: a drive that produced only an errant shot, a charge into the lane for an offensive rebound that sailed off in another direction.</p>
        <p>Camby, who averaged 14.3 points and 10.7 rebounds in helping the Knicks past the Pacers a year ago, had his ability to run and jump limited by the nagging right knee this time. He no longer was a surprise lurking on the weak side of the basket after being kept under close watch as Coach Larry Bird ordered.</p>
        <p>The Pacers did not need to restructure their team with athletes to match Camby, instead just assuring that a player -- whether it was Austin Croshere, Dale Davis, or even the 39-year-old Sam Perkins -- would pay attention to his whereabouts.</p>
        <p>No one stepped forward to help Sprewell and Ewing, leaving only gaping holes that could not be filled.</p>
        <p>''I hate to think about that, because what's reality?'' Johnson said when asked if things might have been different if the Knicks had not succumbed to all of the injuries. ''I thought Dale Davis affected me today. We've got guys banged up. They've got guys banged up. You've got to play through it.''</p>
        <p>Houston, who shot 1 for 6 in the second half, never seemed able to find his way into the offense.</p>
        <p>''I never really got in a rhythm tonight,'' Houston said. ''But that's how it goes sometimes. You have to do other things and I did.''</p>
        <p>With one rebound and one assist, it would be hard to say just what.</p>
        <p>''It's like we were kind of out of it mentally,'' Houston said. ''I don't know what happened. Basically, they did what they had to do and we didn't. That's what it comes down to. That's why they're where they are.''</p>
