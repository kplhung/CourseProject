        <p>The Giants jersey No. 30 hung over the locker stall, waiting for Charles Way -- not to wear, but to take home as a souvenir.</p>
        <p>Just as telling was the black trash bag in the back of Way's locker today at Giants Stadium, packed earlier in the day with personal belongings gathered in his five rugged National Football League seasons as a quiet, tireless and dependable fullback.</p>
        <p>Way, a popular and charismatic leader on the Giants, retired as the team's spring minicamp concluded today, saying he wanted to be able to play recreational sports with his two young daughters in 10 years more than he wanted to try to play one more N.F.L. season.</p>
        <p>''I probably could play a little bit,'' said Way, who had two surgeries in recent months on a creaky right knee that has yet to heal completely. ''But the doctors told me I could end up having knee replacement surgery in 10 years, too. I love football, but it doesn't mean that much to me.''</p>
        <p>As Way, 27, made his retirement announcement on the Giants' practice field, he held the hand of his wife, Tahesha.</p>
        <p>''This has been wrenching for him,'' Tahesha Way said later. ''But we have a 3-year-old daughter and a 6-month-old daughter. He said to me, 'I got to play football, but I've got a family and I want to be able to play with them, too.' ''</p>
        <p>As comfortable as Way seemed with his decision, smiling easily on a cloudless, sunny day, the setting and rationalizations could not entirely mask the fleeting nature of a pro football player's career.</p>
        <p>Less than three years ago Way was the best offensive player on a Giants team that won its division. He was considered among the two or three best fullbacks in the N.F.L. and rushed for a team-leading 698 yards with 37 pass receptions.</p>
        <p>But as the 1998 season dawned, Way's right knee began to bother him and his production plummeted steadily, until he had only 141 rushing yards last season. There was radical knee surgery this winter, although the Giants' doctors did not guarantee that the results would prolong Way's football career.</p>
        <p>In the last few weeks the doctors told Way that he would not be cleared to play, that he would not pass the team physical. Way politely pleaded his case, suggesting that maybe in time and with work, the medical opinion would change. It never did, and by Wednesday, Way decided retirement was his only option.</p>
        <p>''This organization didn't want me to get hurt further and they handled this with class,'' Way said. ''I've been blessed in that regard, so now I'm going to start a new chapter.''</p>
        <p>His teammates rallied around Way today, buoyed by the notion that he would very likely remain around the team in some capacity. The Giants have said they will talk to Way about a job within the organization.</p>
        <p>Although Way has an engineering degree from the University of Virginia, he said he hoped to pursue a career associated with football. He has done some work as a broadcaster in the off-season.</p>
        <p>''I'll miss the Sundays,'' Way said. ''There's nothing like getting ready the whole week to play that game. You get together with the guys in the locker room, knowing you're going out there to try to do something as a team. I know I'll miss that part.</p>
        <p>''I looked forward to that. Now I'll look forward to the next part of my life.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Although CHARLES WAY's retirement will save $1 million on the Giants' salary cap, they may not sign a major free-agent fullback to replace him. Although the team has talked to the former Buffalo fullback SAM GASH, the Giants are considering more one-back sets featuring the rookie RON DAYNE and may not want a high-priced fullback to muddle the picture. Instead, the role of blocking back may be filled by the backup running back SEAN BENNETT, the former backup fullback GREG COMELLA and occasionally a tight end. It might depend on how much Gash or LARRY BOWIE, a fullback cut by Washington on Thursday, would cost the Giants, who are intent on having extra money available for next year's free-agency period.</p>
