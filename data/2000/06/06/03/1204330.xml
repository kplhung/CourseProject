        <p>Topping off a record-breaking spending spree with one last flourish, Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for Senate, is expected to spend up to $2 million next week in an effort to get potential supporters to the polls, a sum that approaches the get-out-the-vote budget for many presidential contests.</p>
        <p>Although campaign officials said they did not know how much would be paid out between now and Tuesday, they said they had earmarked $1.5 million for workers whose sole job will be to encourage likely Corzine supporters to go to the polls. Several Democratic party officials said the number could go as high as $2 million.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Corzine's opponent in the primary, former Gov. Jim Florio, has had a $2 million budget for his entire campaign.</p>
        <p>Although the amount Mr. Corzine expects to dispense next week is a fraction of the $35 million he has spent so far, Mr. Florio said that such a large amount of money for election workers had the potential to taint the outcome.</p>
        <p>''It's another example of Jon Corzine trying to buy an election,'' Mr. Florio said. ''It's beyond the pale of anything anyone has ever seen.''</p>
        <p>Such ''street money,'' as it is called, has a troublesome history in recent state politics. In 1993, Edward J. Rollins, the manager of Christine Todd Whitman's campaign for governor, boasted of using $500,000 in petty cash to suppress the black vote in urban areas. He later recanted the statement, but in response, the rules regarding street money have been tightened. For example, daily campaign workers can be paid only by check, and must provide a Social Security number.</p>
        <p>Typically, most political campaigns rely on volunteers and party loyalists for tasks that include passing out palm cards, driving house-bound elderly people to the polls and reminding potential supporters to go vote. Better-financed candidates have been known to pay small stipends -- generally around $25 -- to Election Day workers, but party officials said they were authorized to give more than $100 to those who will work on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Corzine supporters said they hoped to employ as many as 3,000 people on Monday and Tuesday, although Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for Mr. Corzine, said that 600 of them would be volunteers.</p>
        <p>''This will be a very traditional volunteer get-out-the vote operation, with people pounding the pavement and knocking on doors,'' he said. ''Jim Florio has tried to make it into something else because he does not have the resources.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio, on learning that Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York had crossed the Hudson River today to endorse Mr. Corzine, told reporters that he was stunned, because the senator had praised him in the past for helping to enact tough gun control laws in New Jersey. In contrast, Mr. Florio said, when Mr. Corzine was a co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, the company was helping the parent company of Remington Arms Company in a merger deal.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Schumer called that charge bogus, and he said of Mr. Florio: ''I still consider him a friend. I think Jon Corzine would be a better senator and more electable.''</p>
        <p>Some of the Corzine supporters helping to urge voters to the polls will be from groups that have directly benefited from the largesse of Mr. Corzine, who is said to be worth $400 million. Among them will be 75 members of New Jersey Acorn, a nonprofit housing organization that received $7,000. Jeff Dublin, the vice president, said the money would go toward the workers' $8-an-hour stipend.</p>
        <p>Other beneficiaries of Mr. Corzine's generosity have included the Black United Fund, the Hispanic American Association for Political Awareness and a raft of local Democratic organizations, according to campaign expense reports. In recent weeks, seven county committees each received $30,000. Mr. Corzine has described such contributions as ''party building'' money.</p>
        <p>Adam Zellner, the field coordinator for the Democratic Party committee in Bergen County, said the extra money would make his work easier by paying for literature to be mailed, rather than distributed on foot. ''Usually we struggle to get help,'' he said. ''It's not easy finding people who want to walk door to door in 80-degree heat.''</p>
        <p>Thomas P. Giblin, the chairman of Essex County's Democratic Party, said he hoped to have an army of 1,100 people on Tuesday; some of the Corzine money would help pay for the 15 rented vans that will ferry elderly voters to and from the polls. ''You can't expect people who are making $200 a day to take the day off for $25,'' he said. ''These are not glamorous jobs.'' But he and other party leaders said they were worried that such large payments might be counterproductive in the long run. ''If you give them steak one year, are they going to take bologna the next?'' Mr. Giblin asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zellner said he would not raise the daily stipend above the usual $30. ''I don't want to offer something I can't match next year,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Florio's supporters are making do with an all-volunteer cadre of Election Day workers. A campaign spokesman, Jim Lanard, said he expected to have 3,000 people making calls and knocking on doors on Tuesday. ''Our workers are motivated by loyalty, not by money,'' he said.</p>
        <p>They may condemn Mr. Corzine's spending habits, but many of the party leaders supporting Mr. Florio acknowledge that they wish they had a little more cash to throw around. Gary Karr, the Burlington County Democratic chairman, said he was frustrated by the profusion of Corzine signs. ''They're every six inches,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, he said, he was heartened that a few hundred people had agreed to volunteer for Mr. Florio on Tuesday. ''They'll come because they have a lot of admiration and respect for Governor Florio, not because we can spit out cash at them,'' he said. ''These people are used to burning down the old shoe leather.''</p>
