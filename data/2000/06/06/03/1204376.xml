        <p>The hedge fund empire of George Soros continued to shrink yesterday as Duncan Hennes, who was hired last summer to be chief executive of Soros Fund Management, announced his resignation.</p>
        <p>''I was brought in to do one thing, and George doesn't want to do that anymore,'' Mr. Hennes, 43, said in a telephone interview. That thing, he said, was to build a larger hedge fund business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Soros announced in April that his two top fund managers, Stanley Druckenmiller and Nicholas Roditi, were leaving and that the fund that made Mr. Soros famous, the Quantum Fund, would be renamed the Quantum Endowment Fund and changed in emphasis to reduce its risk.</p>
        <p>At the time, however, Mr. Hennes spoke of his hopes to build up other parts of the hedge fund business and seemed to have no intention of leaving.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, Mr. Hennes said that Mr. Soros had decided not to move forward aggressively in hedge funds, although the firm's operations that invest in real estate and in private companies were continuing to grow.</p>
        <p>''George needed to take some time to decide what he needed to do,'' Mr. Hennes said. ''He has a lot of charitable obligations. He needs to create a platform where he can manage his money in a way that is less volatile, in a way that he can assure he will meet his obligations to the charities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hennes said he would step down on June 30, but remain as a consultant to Soros Fund Management for another three months. He said he did not know what he would do after that.</p>
        <p>Before joining Soros Fund Management, Mr. Hennes was executive vice president and treasurer at Bankers Trust.</p>
        <p>Shawn Pattison, a spokesman for Soros Fund Management, said that while the private equity and real estate operations were expanding, more employees were expected to leave the hedge fund operation. ''We do expect some employees to leave on their own, and that others will be asked to leave,'' he said. The company employs about 240 people, of whom abut 200 are in the hedge fund area.</p>
        <p>The Quantum Fund had very good returns for three decades, but stumbled earlier this year when it did not sell technology stocks soon enough. It also lost money in foreign currencies when it wrongly expected the euro to rise against the dollar. That led to the departure of Mr. Druckenmiller and to the decision by Mr. Soros to seek a more conservative strategy.</p>
