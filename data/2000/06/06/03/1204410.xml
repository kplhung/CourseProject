        <p>What makes the proposals for ''raising standards'' through a core curriculum unlikely to produce cooperative peace between faculty and administration is that they are based on false allegations.

        <p>Re ''A Time for Dialogue at CUNY'' (editorial, May 28):</p>
        <p>What makes the proposals for ''raising standards'' through a core curriculum unlikely to produce cooperative peace between faculty and administration is that they are based on false allegations. CUNY colleges largely already have general education requirements that introduce students to the intellectual goodies of most disciplines -- the result of faculty labors over decades.</p>
        <p>Trustees simply lack the competence to shape curriculums. They are supposed to be concerned with fund-raising and broad policy directions; history will provide a verdict about how successful CUNY trustees have been in those arenas.</p>
        <p>The faculty cannot buy into peace at any price.</p>
