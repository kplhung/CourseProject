        <p>Two days before the Salute to Israel Parade, Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, met with Jewish leaders yesterday, seeking support from a key constituency that traditionally favors Democrats but in this race might be up for grabs.</p>
        <p>In an hourlong meeting with about 25 leaders at an office building in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Lazio said, he explained his positions on a number of concerns among Jewish leaders, showing support for moving the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to recognize the city that Israel claims as its capital. Speaking after the meeting, he said he had also told the gathering that he could not take a position on whether Jonathan Pollard, a convicted spy for Israel, should be granted clemency, because he lacked access to government information in the case. He did say he would support a presidential review.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lazio said he had also told the leaders that he would accept an endorsement from the Independence Party, even though its presidential candidate might be Patrick J. Buchanan, who has been criticized by Hillary Rodham Clinton and others for remarks they consider anti-Semitic.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, plan to march in the Salute to Israel Parade on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan tomorrow, an event neither candidate would be wise to miss because of the pivotal role Jews are expected to play in the election.</p>
        <p>Normally, Democratic candidates in New York can count on heavy Jewish support. But Mr. Lazio's predecessor in the Senate race, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, enjoys strong backing in the Jewish community. And Mrs. Clinton has angered Jewish leaders with her support for an independent Palestinian state and by her visit last year to the West Bank, where Yasir Arafat's wife, Suha, made remarks implicating Israel in the poisoning of Arab women and children. (Mr. Lazio said he told the gathering that he would not have stormed out, but would have kept his distance and publicly condemned the remarks afterward. Mrs. Clinton, who embraced Mrs. Arafat upon leaving, issued a statement several hours later that took issue with Mrs. Arafat's remarks.)</p>
        <p>On some things, Mr. Lazio staked out positions similar to those of Mrs. Clinton. For instance, she too has called for the relocation of the embassy, a move that would bolster Israel's claim to Jerusalem, whose sovereignty is claimed by both Arabs and Jews.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, however, supports moving the embassy, but also supports legislation that, while mandating the move, would allow the administration to delay the move if it considered doing so as helpful to the peace process. Mr. Lazio said he believed the sovereignty of Israel overrode such considerations.</p>
        <p>''It's important for America to demonstrate to Israelis and to the world that we stand foursquare behind Israel and the sovereignty of Israel,'' he said after the meeting.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has not taken a position on the issue of clemency for Mr. Pollard, the American convicted of passing secrets to Israel. Mr. Pollard is serving a life sentence that Jewish groups, and an increasing number of politicians, call too harsh.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, whose husband has resisted calls for clemency, said yesterday she would ''work on'' forming an opinion before the November election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said, ''I haven't had the kind of secured briefing that people need to make that kind of judgment'' on whether Mr. Pollard should be freed. But he called on the next president, within six months of taking office, to open a comprehensive review of the case to determine whether clemency is warranted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said he faced several  questions about his possible association with the Independence Party, the New York State affiliate of the Reform Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said he told those gathered that he found Mr. Buchanan a ''divisive force in American politics'' but that he would still accept an endorsement from the party, even if Mr. Buchanan's name was on the ballot with his.</p>
        <p>''I will be making very clear that I accept the votes of the Independence Party voters but I do not accept any support from Pat Buchanan,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>Malcolm Honlein, executive director of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, who attended the meeting, said Mr. Lazio's stance on Mr. Buchanan might cause trouble with Jewish voters.</p>
        <p>''I think we have to see how it plays out,'' Mr. Honlein said, adding he would watch how ''you distance yourself from somebody associated with the party yet retain the support of the voters.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said yesterday she would never appear on a ballot with Mr. Buchanan.</p>
        <p>''I think his record of anti-Semitic comments, his record of intolerant and prejudicial remarks are ones that I don't want to be associated with,'' she said. ''I just think for me, it would be unacceptable.''</p>
        <p>Senator Charles M. Schumer, appearing with Mrs. Clinton at a news conference to announce a gun-licensing proposal he intends to propose next week, said he would work to raise her standing among Jews.</p>
        <p>''The argument I'm going to make to Jewish leaders is that Hillary Clinton is a strong supporter of Israel and will be true blue in that, but we also agree with her on so many other issues as well,'' he said. ''I think that argument will have lots and lots of resonance.''</p>
