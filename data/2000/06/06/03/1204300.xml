        <p>Premiere No. 6 in the Diamond Project, the New York City Ballet's showcase of new works, is ''Swerve Poems,'' choreographed by Kevin O'Day to a commissioned score by John King.</p>
        <p>To its credit, the ballet, which had its first performance on Thursday night at the New York State Theater, breaks the mold of the strict neo-classical style that dominates most Diamond Project entries. Mr. O'Day is no disciple of City Ballet's founding father, George Balanchine, although he has a firm knowledge of the classical idiom and uses it with a welcome brashness.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, whatever individuality is promised here soon recalls other O'Day-King collaborations. Here again, choreography avoids interplay with the music, which offers atmosphere but no springboard for dancing.</p>
        <p>The dancers, mostly barelegged (the women are on toe, are extremely good in fast, athletic combinations of steps that require stamina and unison precision. They look spiky and sharp. Plotless, the choreography also evokes relationships among young people.</p>
        <p>Yet the dancers exist in a separate world from the equally good musicians in the pit and the gap between music and dance is a desert that finally turns the skillful choreography into an arid display. At the end, the women collapse over their partners' bent backs, perhaps as pooped as the audience by a series of entries that should have ended earlier.</p>
        <p>Conducted on this occasion by Mr. King, the musicians included Mary Rowell and Todd Reynolds (violins), David Gold (viola), Dorothy Lawson (cello) and Marty Ehrlich and J. D. Parran (bass clarinets). One couldn't ask for a better new-music group and, as an experimental jazz composer, Mr. King offers a complex overlay of rhythm and melody that has its own validity. Certainly, this score (''Poem 2.0''), commissioned by City Ballet, offers more than the jagged mix of guitar and electronic sound in Mr. King's music that has attracted Mr. O'Day since he stopped using more conventional composers.</p>
        <p>When Mr. O'Day, once a dancer in the Joffrey Ballet and Twyla Tharp's company, started choreographing, a wider choice of music seemed to leave him more options. In choosing to work with Mr. King, he gives his choreography the trappings of an experimental scene but offers more attitude than substance.</p>
        <p>To have panels onstage rise or to  form a small arch (strongly lighted by Mark Stanley) seems almost a self-mocking comment on faux modernism. Nonetheless, the ballet begins as Tom Gold erupts in a high-leaping solo and then disappears into a trap door under the arch. When other dancers later pop up from the trap, the joke wears thin.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Day's forte is in clarity of design. The first two couples, Stacey Calvert and Albert Evans, Abi Stafford and Arch Higgins (all in Carole Divet's gray tunics) yield to Wendy Whelan and Philip Neal. Yet all are brought into communal patterns. James Fayette and Jennie Somogyi, both dancing wonderfully with newfound romance, have the most interesting choreography, in a wraparound duet. Mr. Gold teams up with Carrie Lee Riggins, and Craig Hall, a new talent to watch, with Pauline Golbin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Neal is the most classical of the men, but he looks at ease in the general arm-swinging and pelvis-rotating. Ms. Whelan is tossed around by the men and each of the four main couples have at least one duet. Re-entering, Ms. Whelan hangs onto Mr. Neal's neck, back to back.</p>
        <p>As the music warbles and slides, there is some admirable counterpoint for two groups of three men and the women cluster in fast pirouettes. One section, however, does not lead logically into another and the final image in this collage is preceded by a group grope in silence. In all, ballet defined by non sequiturs.</p>
        <p>The evening opened with the Balanchine-Stravinsky ''Agon,'' conducted with a fine vivid tempo by Andrea Quinn. Maria Kowrowski and Jock Soto offered something unusual in the central pas de deux: she was like an exuberant filly that Mr. Soto, brilliant as a partner, had to rein in. Kathleen Tracey's technique did not give the second ballerina's solo its full value, but Damian Woetzel gave his solo the flourish of a dashing musketeer.</p>
        <p>''I'm Old Fashioned,'' Jerome Robbins's ballroom tribute to Fred Astaire, conducted by Hugo Fiorato, was shortened when Helene Alexopoulos fell ill shortly before the curtain went up. The performance went on smoothly despite some omitted passages. A perfectly rehearsed ensemble was led exuberantly by Nikolaj Hubbe and Ms. Whelan, (witty in a duet full of deliberate collisions), Mr. Higgins, Mr. Neal and Jenifer Ringer.</p>
