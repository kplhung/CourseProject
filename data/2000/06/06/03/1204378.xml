        <p>The Nasdaq composite index soared 6.44 percent yesterday, ending its best week ever, as investors cheered data suggesting that the nation's economy is slowing and the Federal Reserve may be almost done raising interest rates.</p>
        <p>The gains in many technology stocks echoed the wild trading seen in January and February, with many big technology companies rising 10 percent or more on heavy volume. Over all, the Nasdaq rose 230.88 points, to 3,813.38, continuing its extraordinary volatility. For the week, it was up 19 percent. Other indexes also gained. The Dow Jones industrial average increased 142.56 points, or 1.34 percent, to 10,794.76, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index jumped 28.45 points, or 1.96 percent, to 1,477.26.</p>
        <p>With unemployment in May rising unexpectedly and wages nearly flat, Wall Street strategists believe that the Federal Reserve is no longer likely to raise short-term interest rates later this month and may not have to push rates much higher this year. To slow the economy and keep inflation down, the Fed has already raised short-term rates six times since June 1999, and until this week many economists thought at least two more increases were likely.</p>
        <p>Higher interest rates are usually considered bad for stocks, because a slower economy hurts corporate profits. Now, whether right or wrong, investors, who are convinced that rates will remain relatively stable, are eagerly seeking out shares in many of the companies they fled earlier this spring.</p>
        <p>The buying spree, which began in earnest Wednesday, accelerated yesterday as many stocks jumped at the opening bell and stayed strong through the close of trading.</p>
        <p>''The message is fairly clear that investors, after believing that there would be at least one more Fed tightening, have concluded that would not be the case,'' said Ed Yardeni, chief economist and global investment strategist with Deutsche Bank Securities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yardeni said he believed the Fed, whose primary mandate is to keep the United States economy growing steadily with low inflation, ran the risk of embarrassing itself if it continued to raise rates this summer.</p>
        <p>Despite a spike in energy prices and scattered indications that wage inflation is rising, ''the latest inflation indicators suggest that inflation isn't even close to being a problem,'' Mr. Yardeni said.</p>
        <p>''The Fed is just going to have to chill out and enjoy prosperity,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief investment strategist for Goldman, Sachs, said the breadth of this week's rally impressed her. While the Nasdaq's frantic gains in January and February came largely at the expense of old-economy stocks in the S.&amp; P. 500, the gains this week included both the Nasdaq and the S.&amp; P., Ms. Cohen said.</p>
        <p>''This is a situation where investors are taking a look at the economic data and deciding the situation was not quite as ugly as they had assumed,'' she said. ''The economy is still growing, but more slowly.''</p>
        <p>Still, yesterday's action had more than a touch of last winter's speculative fever to it. Many big Nasdaq stocks rose 10 percent or more, with JDS Uniphase up 12 1/8, to 110 3/8, and Broadvision gaining 10 1/8, to 53 5/8. The bellwether Cisco Systems, the second-largest stock on the Nasdaq, continued to rally, gaining 3 7/16, to 64 3/8. Cisco has now gained almost 30 percent in just over a week, adding $100 billion to its market valuation.</p>
        <p>Other big winners included financial stocks, which often gain when interest rates are falling. Merrill Lynch rose 4, to 108, while Citigroup jumped 2 15/16, to 66 1/4.</p>
        <p>Mickey Levy, the chief economist at Banc of America Securities, said he expected financial stocks to continue to gain. ''Financial stocks always outperform prior to an inflection point,'' when the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates, Mr. Levy said. ''They've been rallying in the last few weeks. They've outperformed. As analysts soften their expectations for the Fed to tighten even more, the rotation into financials will continue.''</p>
        <p>But not everyone believes the Fed is done raising rates. Stephen Slifer, the chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers, said he still expected the bank to increase short-term rates by one-quarter of a percentage point at the end of June and another quarter-point in August. In the wake of yesterday's unemployment report, which showed joblessness rose from 3.9 percent in April to 4.1 percent in May, Lehman lowered its estimates for United States economic growth for the second quarter from 6.3 percent to 4.7 percent.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Slifer expects the economy to expand at 5.2 percent for all of this year and another 3.7 percent next year, levels that are high by the standards of the last two decades. With the economy growing so fast, the Fed must remain wary of inflation, Mr. Slifer said.</p>
        <p>''By any sort of recent historical standards, growth is just off the charts,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, has publicly worried about the potential inflationary effect of a rising stock market. As the market rises, investors who feel flush may increase their spending, overheating the economy and causing inflation.</p>
        <p>Coming along with the broader economic slowdown, the nearly 40 percent drop in the Nasdaq between March 10 and Tuesday, which erased more than $2 trillion in investor wealth, may have alleviated some of the Fed's concerns, Mr. Slifer said. But if the Nasdaq regains its losses too quickly, it could once again overheat the economy, he said.</p>
        <p>''A couple of months from now, if the Fed doesn't do anything, they could be right back worrying about the economy overheating again,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Bond prices were mixed yesterday. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 2/32, to 104 9/32. The bond's yield was unchanged at 5.94 percent. The price of the 10-year note rose 4/32, to 104 9/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.16 percent from 6.17 percent on Thursday.</p>
