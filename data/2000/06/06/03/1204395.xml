        <p>The death on Tuesday of Robert P. Casey, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania from 1987 to 1994, was a reminder that one of the most significant speeches in the last decade of American politics was never delivered. It was significant, in fact, precisely because it was never delivered.</p>
        <p>At the 1992 Democratic National Convention, Governor Casey asked to present a minority report opposing the party's plank on abortion that declared ''reproductive choice'' a ''fundamental right'' deserving government financing. The party leadership barred Mr. Casey from addressing the delegates.</p>
        <p>The Casey obituaries mentioned the event, but they did not fully capture its significance. It was a watershed in the nation's political-moral discourse. At the national level of one of the two major political parties, opposition to abortion had become literally unspeakable.</p>
        <p>This was a momentous achievement for supporters of the right to abortion. By 1988, of course, the Democratic Party platform had already become uncompromisingly in favor of abortion rights. Gone was the mollifying phrase in earlier platforms that Democrats ''fully recognize the religious and ethical concerns which many Americans have about abortion.''</p>
        <p>But refusing the podium to the liberal and immensely popular Governor Casey (he won re-election in 1990 by the largest margin in Pennsylvania history) went a step further. As David R. Carlin Jr., a frustrated Democratic state senator from Rhode Island, put it in an Op-Ed article for The New York Times in August 1992: ''The national Democratic leadership has made it plain that there is no room in the party for opposition to abortion. Being pro-choice is not simply a majority opinion; it has become a mandatory position.''</p>
        <p>At the local level, that is not always true, but at the national level it remains the case eight years later. No Democrat with pretensions to national leadership can afford not to be strictly in favor of abortion rights. Quite a few, including Vice President Al Gore, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, have jettisoned their previous reservations about abortion. When something becomes undiscussable, it is pretty much irreversible.</p>
        <p>For abortion foes who had already cast their fortunes with the Republican Party, the Democrats' sidelining of Mr. Casey meant little more than another opportunity to say, ''We told you so.''  But for those who considered themselves liberals or dyed-in-the-wool Democrats, the moment posed a moral dilemma that remains unresolved even now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Casey was their kind of politician, and if his credentials could not earn one a hearing for an anti-abortion case, what could? The Philadelphia Inquirer's obituary called him ''a fervent Democrat'' and a man who ''stood solidly behind some of his party's most enduring ideals, particularly in his concern for poor and blue-collar citizens.''</p>
        <p>He strove for health insurance for all Pennsylvanians and, failing that, gained coverage for poor children whose families became ineligible for Medicaid. He backed labor rights and tax breaks for the poor, improved the workers' compensation system, increased financing for public schools and mandated trash recycling.</p>
        <p>He even pushed through a controversial tax increase -- ''despised'' was the word used for it in The Inquirer obituary -- that allowed Pennsylvania to remain fiscally strong through recessionary days and passed on a financial surplus to his successor.</p>
        <p>That successor, Gov. Tom Ridge, is facing a similar interdict on the other side of the abortion issue. A Republican who favors abortion rights and, like Mr. Casey, an extremely popular leader in a crucial state for the presidential race, Governor Ridge has been promoted as a possible running mate for Gov. George W. Bush -- to cries of betrayal and threats of abandonment from anti-abortion Republicans.</p>
        <p>''Litmus test'' is the term for this kind of unbendable standard about abortion among Republicans, although it can operate at least as rigorously among Democrats.</p>
        <p>Actually, there is nothing wrong with litmus tests, in morals and politics, no less than in the laboratory. Political parties have every right to rule some topics totally off limits. Reasonable citizens do not complain that Holocaust deniers, champions of totalitarianism or defenders of lynching are denied recognition and barred from convention microphones.</p>
        <p>The question is whether Democrats opposed to abortion and Republicans who favor abortion rights should be lumped with such company. In an editorial calling the Republican platform ''merciless'' on abortion, also in August 1992, The New York Times warned that ''moderate, mainstream voices'' should not be kept from making their case at the party's convention.</p>
        <p>''When it comes to free expression on abortion,'' the editorial added, ''the Republicans have no patent on manipulation. The Democrats acted even more crudely in New York last month. They were so devoted to freedom of choice that they buried freedom of speech, refusing to allow Gov. Robert Casey to voice anti-abortion sentiments at their convention.''</p>
        <p>Writing that same month as a ''pro-life Democrat'' and a sympathizer with the ''wimpy liberalism'' that rejected the ''winner-take-all mentality'' on both sides of the abortion debate, Mr. Carlin said: ''We have been locked out of our own house, yet we have no desire to enter the Republican house next door. We are political pariahs.''</p>
        <p>It is a measure of the success of the abortion rights' movement that, two presidential races later, Republican divisions over abortion continue to be scrutinized while the pariah status of people like Mr. Carlin, with all its attendant resentments and election booth abstentions, can be largely ignored. Mr. Ridge has a real chance for the vice-presidential slot, while Mr. Casey would get even less a hearing today than he did in 1992.</p>
        <p>In October 1992 another Casey speech went undelivered, this time at Cooper Union School of Architecture in Manhattan. Mr. Casey was to speak in the school's Great Hall, where, in 1860, Abraham Lincoln had challenged the Supreme Court's acceptance of slavery.</p>
        <p>Shouting demonstrators in favor of abortion rights, however, kept Mr. Casey from speaking. When Nat Hentoff, stalwart civil libertarian, maverick opponent of abortion and writer for The Village Voice, which was sponsoring the event, admonished the demonstrators with recollections of Stalinism and left-wing intolerance, they could not have cared less.</p>
        <p>''Murderers have no right to speak,'' they shouted, referring to the dangers of illegal abortions.</p>
        <p>The title of this undelivered speech was ''Can a Liberal Be Pro-Life?'' At Cooper Union, the demonstrators' answer was a raucous ''No.'' In the Democratic Party, the answer is less raucous but otherwise no different.</p>
