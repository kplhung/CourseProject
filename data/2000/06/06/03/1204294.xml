        <p>Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic are ending their season with grand gestures. First, the orchestra played the Bruckner Seventh -- the work with which Mr. Masur began his tenure in 1991 -- at its free annual Memorial Day concert at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. And now, for its final week of subscription concerts, which ends tonight at Avery Fisher Hall, Mr. Masur is offering the Mahler Ninth Symphony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Masur has addressed Mahler's music with mixed results over the years, but not for lack of a point of view. Judging from his performances, including the opening of the current series on Thursday evening, what Mr. Masur prizes in Mahler is intellectual rigor and orchestrational virtuosity. The composer's heart-on-the-sleeve emotionalism seems to interest Mr. Masur less; in fact, he seems almost embarrassed by it, and his readings tend to play it down considerably, without entirely denying it.</p>

        <p>Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic are ending their season with grand gestures. First, the orchestra played the Bruckner Seventh -- the work with which Mr. Masur began his tenure in 1991 -- at its free annual Memorial Day concert at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. And now, for its final week of subscription concerts, which ends tonight at Avery Fisher Hall, Mr. Masur is offering the Mahler Ninth Symphony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Masur has addressed Mahler's music with mixed results over the years, but not for lack of a point of view. Judging from his performances, including the opening of the current series on Thursday evening, what Mr. Masur prizes in Mahler is intellectual rigor and orchestrational virtuosity. The composer's heart-on-the-sleeve emotionalism seems to interest Mr. Masur less; in fact, he seems almost embarrassed by it, and his readings tend to play it down considerably, without entirely denying it.</p>
        <p>Often, it is as though Mr. Masur's brisk, clear-textured performances were a way of saying, ''Forget the pained introspection and look at another aspect of Mahler for a change.'' And sometimes it's tempting. In each of the Ninth's four movements, he brought forth details of balance and color that slip past unnoticed in other performances. He also made a case for Mahler as a pivotal figure in the history of composition, with roots in Wagner's freewheeling approach to tonality and coloration and as a traceable influence on Stravinsky (in the second movement) and Shostakovich (in the third and fourth).</p>
        <p>The Philharmonic players gave him everything he needed: brilliant brass and wind playing in the first three movements, an irresistible energy and power in the Rondo Burleske, and truly gorgeous string playing -- not least in the sighing pianissimos -- in the closing Adagio. Apart from a few diffuse moments at the opening of the work, everything was in place, Mr. Masur's fluid tempos let the music breathe.</p>
        <p>In a certain way, his approach is an antidote to the emotional conception of Mahler that has ruled since Bernstein's day, and perhaps some listeners find that refreshing. The question is whether an antidote is desirable. Structure is fine, and so is brilliant orchestration, but can one persuasively argue that they are the essence of Mahler?</p>
        <p>Here was a performance that was admirable in every quantifiable way. Yet anyone who hoped to be swept into the dark clouds of Mahler's world -- to be buffeted by anxieties transformed into bitter brass passages, or moved by the wrenching sadness of the Adagio -- could only savor the fine, cold details and think about what makes more hot-blooded readings work so well.</p>
