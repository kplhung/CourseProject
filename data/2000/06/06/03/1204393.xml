        <p>With time ticking off the inevitable in the Indiana Pacers' Eastern Conference championship last night, Larry Bird allowed himself to step out of character, if only for an instant. It was a moment that only his assistant coach and good friend, Rick Carlisle, would see.</p>
        <p>''When we knew we had it won at the end, he and I looked at each other and there was a grin,'' Carlisle said. ''And you don't see Larry smile very often out there.''</p>
        <p>After the Pacers' 93-80 victory catapulted them into the National Basketball Association finals for the first time -- and after three years of being in the conference finals under Bird --  the Hall of Fame player allowed himself to be happy. For his players. ''Playing is the ultimate, being out there and having the ball in your hands, that's the greatest feeling in the world,'' Bird said. ''Right now, I'm just happy for these guys. They earned it.''</p>
        <p>Bird already said he would resign as coach after this season, which has now been extended for at least another four games. ''When he came, he had a plan, to try to get this team to the next level, which is the finals,'' Carlisle said. ''The plan was about giving these guys confidence and giving these guys the dream.''</p>
        <p>Since becoming head coach, Bird has earned the respect of his players for more than his ability on the court.  So they were just as thrilled for him as they were for himself. ''Larry is just one of those guys who goes out of his way to show how proud he is of us,'' the veteran Sam Perkins said. ''He's been there a trillion times.''</p>
        <p>Actually, Bird has been to the finals five times, three times coming away with a championship while playing for the Boston Celtics.</p>
        <p>''It's been three years, but actually, for me, it's been 13 years since I've been there.'' He added, allowing himself to smile, ''a slow 13 years.''</p>
