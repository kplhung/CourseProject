        <p>Meetings between American presidents and their Russian counterparts pack less drama than they used to. But they still matter. Bill Clinton's meetings with Vladimir Putin, the first since Mr. Putin became Russia's president, provide a timely opportunity to discuss issues ranging from nuclear arms control to market reforms and human rights. Mr. Clinton should use his public appearances, including a radio call-in show and an address to Parliament, to hail Mr. Putin's steps toward reform and criticize troubling signs of authoritarianism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's leadership personality is still unfolding. The theme of his presidency so far has been the reorganization of the central government. That is a reasonable response to the catastrophic breakdown of services over the past decade. But there are concerns that Mr. Putin, who was a K.G.B. officer in the Soviet era, means to reassert Kremlin powers at the expense of Russia's nascent civil liberties. Last month's raid on Media-MOST, a leading private media company, was troubling in this regard. So is Moscow's continuing military brutality in Chechnya and Mr. Putin's legislative drive to override the power of elected regional governors.</p>

        <p>Mr. Putin's leadership personality is still unfolding. The theme of his presidency so far has been the reorganization of the central government. That is a reasonable response to the catastrophic breakdown of services over the past decade. But there are concerns that Mr. Putin, who was a K.G.B. officer in the Soviet era, means to reassert Kremlin powers at the expense of Russia's nascent civil liberties. Last month's raid on Media-MOST, a leading private media company, was troubling in this regard. So is Moscow's continuing military brutality in Chechnya and Mr. Putin's legislative drive to override the power of elected regional governors.</p>
        <p>More encouraging are the economic goals reflected in his cabinet appointments and proposals to reform the income tax code. Higher oil prices and the consequences of earlier ruble devaluations have spurred a modest economic revival in Russia. But this windfall must now be sustained by a coherent set of government policies including further simplifications of the tax code and improvements in property and bankruptcy laws.</p>
        <p>No breakthroughs on nuclear arms cuts or missile defense are expected this weekend. But in an interview with NBC News Mr. Putin acknowledged that he, too, recognized a potential threat from small, unpredictable nuclear powers. He said he intended to propose a joint defensive system to counter it. The details of Mr. Putin's ideas have yet to be filled in, but they are likely to be quite different from the national missile defense system currently being tested by the Pentagon. Mr. Clinton should listen carefully to any new Russian proposal. It could ease the path to an eventual agreement. As for offensive warheads, both sides have strong reason to move ahead with deep new cuts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's presidency is just beginning, while Mr. Clinton's is drawing to a close. But the remaining seven and a half months during which their terms overlap should not be wasted. Mr. Clinton has full authority to negotiate on nuclear issues through next January. As leader of the world's foremost democracy he also has the moral authority, and  obligation, to speak out in defense of human rights and Russia's newly won freedoms.</p>
