        <p>With a fedora, a shirt specked with small panels of color, and his white plastic alto saxophone, Ornette Coleman ambled onstage at Battery Park's lawn on Thursday night, the first night of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival. He sat on a stool, thanked his doctor for making it possible for him to play with a broken wrist (his right hand was in a splint) and gave a preface.</p>
        <p>''There's lots of music that's played because it applies to a particular race or style,'' he said. ''But music is not a race or a style. It's an idea.'' Then he talked about the importance of sharing music with everyone in the world. ''Sound is free of grammar,'' he said.</p>

        <p>With a fedora, a shirt specked with small panels of color, and his white plastic alto saxophone, Ornette Coleman ambled onstage at Battery Park's lawn on Thursday night, the first night of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival. He sat on a stool, thanked his doctor for making it possible for him to play with a broken wrist (his right hand was in a splint) and gave a preface.</p>
        <p>''There's lots of music that's played because it applies to a particular race or style,'' he said. ''But music is not a race or a style. It's an idea.'' Then he talked about the importance of sharing music with everyone in the world. ''Sound is free of grammar,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Coleman has his own grammar, and despite its built-in permissiveness it is as commanding as anything that American music has to offer. Despite his concept of ''harmolodics'' -- a theory of open harmony that allows players great freedom and mobility -- his melody-to-melody style of improvising and its skittering rhythms are like a dye. When musicians play with him, they get a touch of it, finding themselves within his light, gamboling, songlike phrases and quick downward zigzags; sometimes, in a faded way, it remains part of their style forever.</p>
        <p>Thursday night's concert put Mr. Coleman in three different contexts, all of which were unmistakably Ornette Coleman music. The first was a premiere of his Global Expression project, featuring Mr. Coleman's jazz trio with three Indian musicians, keyboards and Mari Okubo, who sang words and melodies written by Mr. Coleman, some of it translated into Japanese. Ustad Sultan Khan played the sarangi, an Indian bowed lute, in drones or sweeping phrases; Badal Roy played tablas, accompanying Denardo Coleman's trap-drum set; Prabhaker Karekar sang trilling, wordless melodies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coleman played his own style, racing ahead in his own rhythms as a spry, cool presence amid a conceptual backing that ran the risk of becoming ponderous.</p>
        <p>As is the case with his electric band, Prime Time, all these loosely organized pieces stopped on a dime with a cue from the leader; the abrupt, pulled-up-short feeling is one of the funny pleasures of Mr. Coleman's music.</p>
        <p>Rhythmically, the group's rhythms changed throughout the set. One song was in a fast, undulating tempo; one in a slow, constant, choppy pattern that recalled Miles Davis's electric music of the early 70's; one a hip-hop rhythm with an electronic keyboard and a rhythm machine. The bassist Charnett Moffett, listening hard and providing a bed of harmony, had a lot to do with gluing this music together. And where at the beginning the music's simultaneous keys led to clashes, by the end of the set band members had found a way to swim together gracefully.</p>
        <p>The second piece, ''Freedom Symbol,'' performed with a 20-piece chamber ensemble, was originally written for a French festival in 1989; its full original title is ''Le Statue (The Country that Gave the Freedom Symbol to America).'' (The musicians could see the statue in the harbor by looking left from the stage.) It was given an energetic reading.</p>
        <p>The piece opens and closes with dense full-ensemble writing; Mr. Coleman's composing for strings is an overloaded, polytonal riot and always seems to sound mournful.</p>
        <p>For a long middle stretch, individual players had their own cadenzas. Mr. Coleman changes the structure of the piece from performance to performance; its strength rests heavily on the power of the soloists.</p>
        <p>Directed by Tom Chiu, the soloists -- the best of them included Lew Soloff, trumpeter; David Morgan, clarinetist; Johnny Reinhard, bassoonist; John Clark, french horn player, and Lois Martin, violist -- gave particularly strong turns, all the better for being spirited but plain-spoken and not seeking the rhetoric of jazz improvisation. Some were performed alone, some backed with eighth-notes from the double-bass, some in a trio (in Mr. Soloff's case, with guitar and timpani). What many of them had in common was an echo of the saxophone playing of Mr. Coleman: the harmonies, the sunniness, the comfort in its stops and starts.</p>
        <p>For the concert's prematurely snipped finish, Mr. Coleman played with Charlie Haden on bass and Billy Higgins on drums. They were peforming freshly written pieces, most of them untitled, and even during written parts it had so much effortless confidence that it sounded much like ad-libbing with direction.</p>
        <p>One of the pleasures of jazz concertgoing is to see a group of older musicians who have played together so often that individually and together they have reached the essence of their style. Such is the case with this particular trio, who have been exploring their little corner of jazz since they met in Los Angeles in 1957.</p>
        <p>What they played on Thursday  were chunks of a long discourse, all of a piece. To break it down into compositions of separate character and merit would miss the point. Though certainly different on the surface, the music was closer on the lower levels to what Mr. Coleman found in Morocco in the early 1970's when he played ritual religious music with the musicians of Joujouka.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coleman was working at an evolved level of melodic improvisation, in which only a few notes and intervals can guide what follows. Mostly avoiding the horn's lower register -- perhaps it had to do with his impaired right hand -- he played strong, bright lines. There were miles of open space in this gentle music, generous pauses of action from each player, rhythms that kept shifting in the hands of Mr. Haden and especially Mr. Higgins, with his direction-changing drum rolls and the lovely constant of his ride cymbal.</p>
        <p>One particular moment brought the crowd to laughter: after a Bach-like bass solo, a loud honk was heard in the air -- it could have been the Staten Island Ferry or an 18-wheeler -- and Mr. Coleman played a slightly higher low note on his saxophone, triggering a re-entry of the trio into more collective improvising.</p>
        <p>Though he had his violin and his trumpet on hand, Mr. Coleman never touched them. A planned grand finale wasn't in the cards, either. From the start, the concert had ambient problems: jackhammers, which relented after a while, and some other special effects that were even more obtrusive.</p>
        <p>Giving warning of a 10:15 p.m. curfew, at 10:10 the Parks Department turned the lights on the audience with blinding force and started up a clattering electric generator behind the crowd. Fifteen minutes later, after a set of not more than 45 minutes, the band quit. It was a grotesque finish to a concert that was really getting somewhere.</p>
