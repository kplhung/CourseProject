        <p>McSWEENEY-Edward F. III. ''Dooley.'' It should warm your eternal spirit to know that whenever two of your 250 nearest and dearest friends gather, ''Dooley stories'' punctuate the conversation and you and the enduring value of your friendship are inevitably the subject of the first and last toast. Nine years later, babycakes, you are loved all the more for all the right reasons. See ya. Your pal, JPK. McSWEENEY-Edward F. III (Dooley). Our accounting teacher at Brooklyn College urged us all to ''go out there and make a difference.'' I never knew how big a difference one could make until I started to re-assess the long-term impact of our friend ''Dooley''. The number of people who came to know each other through him; the number of consummated transactions in which he played some introductory role; the number of growing businesses whose financial success originated with ''Dooley's'' efforts could together fund the budget of the state of California. Although ''Dooley'' did not get to see many of the fruits of his often brilliant and always generous efforts, his extraordinarily broad circle of friends certainly did. That is not such a bad legacy. Next year we will gather on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of your passing to again celebrate the importance of your life to us. Stanley Goldstei</p>
