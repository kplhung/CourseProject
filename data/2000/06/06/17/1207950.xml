        <p>It seems like two sequels are being produced in Washington these days.</p>
        <p>In front of Union Station, the city's main railroad terminal, camera crews have been busily filming ''Hannibal,'' the follow-up to the hit movie ''Silence of the Lambs.'' In the Capitol a few blocks away and in the White House down Pennsylvania Avenue, Republicans and Democrats seem to be making a reprise of last year's budget battle.</p>
        <p>In their drama, however, Republicans are fervently hoping for a happier ending, praying that, in the end, President Clinton, their version of the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter, will not eat them for lunch -- again.</p>
        <p>For the Republicans, speed is the watchword, especially in the House. They want to pass spending bills quickly so that ample time is allowed to negotiate a final budget deal with the president, who has already threatened to veto 6 of the 13 spending bills.</p>
        <p>''We need to negotiate with the president, and we have to negotiate with the president,'' said Representative C. W. Bill Young, the amiable Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. ''But if you don't pass bills before September and October, you don't have time to leisurely negotiate with the president.''</p>
        <p>Those negotiations are expected to be contentious. With the veto threats,  the White House complains that the bills provide $23 billion less than Mr. Clinton has requested and scale back some of his favorite initiatives, like providing more money for classroom teachers and setting aside more lands for national monuments.</p>
        <p>With the Treasury awash in a budget surplus, Mr. Clinton and his advisers believe they are on sound policy and political grounds to stand firm against what they see as Republican parsimony.</p>
        <p>''In a time of affluence, in a time of surplus, you make different kinds of judgments than you do when you're facing a crippling deficit,'' said Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and the Budget.</p>
        <p>So far, House leaders have been making good on their promise of speed. With the passage in the wee hours of this morning of a spending bill to fund the Interior Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies, the House has approved 5 spending measures, and its leaders predict that all 13 will be cleared for action on the floor by the time the House adjourns for its July Fourth recess. The Senate has approved three spending measures, though providing money at levels far different from the House versions.</p>
        <p>Still, action has been slower in the Senate, and the House leaders have been able to maintain unity on the measures only by persuading some of their moderate members to vote for measures just to keep the process going.</p>
        <p>''We're replaying a record that has been played for each of the previous three years,'' said Robert Reischauer, the former head of the Congressional Budget Office. ''The year starts off with the Republican leadership saying, 'This year will be different. We'll get the appropriations bills through in a timely fashion and use the month of September and maybe a little bit of October to negotiate with the White House.'</p>
        <p>''Then what happens is that the press of other business slows things down and divisions within the Republican Party slow things down.''</p>
        <p>The House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, acknowledges a certain inevitability of this year's budget fight, saying the ''essential model will be the same.'' But Mr. Armey disputes the idea that the Republicans were routed last year.</p>
        <p>''The president is the biggest spin doctor in this town,'' Mr. Armey said. ''We got some of what we wanted. They got some of they wanted. But they jumped up and down celebrating like they won the whole ball of wax.''</p>
        <p>Even some Republicans who have been critical of their party's leaders in the past say they have little choice but to follow the course they have set. If the Republicans drew up spending bills that would attract the support of Democrats and the president, they would lose the backing of conservative Republicans, possibly ensuring that no measures were approved. That could lead to a government shutdown, a result that Republican leaders fear most.</p>
        <p>''What's their alternative?'' said Representative Peter T. King, a Long Island Republican who has often been at odds with his party's leadership. ''If they get 1 or 2 Democrats, they would lose 5 to 10 Republicans.''</p>
        <p>Looming over Congress as it works to complete its constitutionally required work on spending bills that allow the government to continue operating are the coming elections. With all of the House and a third of the Senate up for election, lawmakers are eager to finish their work and return home to campaign.</p>
        <p>And many lawmakers are well aware that with Republicans holding a mere six-vote majority in the House and lacking the ability to break a filibuster in the Senate, Congress has achieved little this session. Measures like a patients' bill of rights, liberalizing trade with China and reforming election law have largely languished.</p>
        <p>As a result, the spending bills have become magnets for the ideological and policy divisions that are always found in Congress. Vetoes have been threatened not only because the White House feels Republicans' budget bills do not provide enough money for programs, but also because some measures contain amendments that do such things as block agencies like Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services from transferring money to the Justice Department to help in its suit against tobacco companies.</p>
        <p>For all of Mr. Armey's assurances, Congressional Republicans want to avoid a repeat of last year when Congress and the White House did not put the final touches on the last spending bills until Nov. 19, 50 days after the fiscal year began.</p>
        <p>In the crush of the last-minute negotiations, with the threat of a government shutdown looming over their heads and needing to ladle out pork-barrel projects to bring reluctant lawmakers on board, Republican leaders ended up agreeing to a budget that was more than $30 billion more than the limits that had been placed on spending by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.</p>
        <p>Such an explosion in spending is heatedly opposed by a small group of House Republicans who call themselves the Conservative Action Team, known on the Hill as the Cats. Given the slim Republican majority, the conservative lawmakers exert tremendous sway over the House leaders, who know they can scuttle any bill by withdrawing their support.</p>
        <p>''The only thing that bodes well for us is that we've only got a six-vote majority and I'm going to stretch that as much as I can to not spend your grandchildren's money,'' said Representative Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican and a leading voice among the Cats.</p>
        <p>This week's action on a spending bill to fund the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and Education and other social service agencies displayed all the promise and the potential pitfalls of the Republicans' strategy.</p>
        <p>The $342 billion measure -- the largest of the 13 spending bills -- is traditionally a lightning rod for fights over health and education policy, even though 71 percent its money go to programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Last year the bill was so controversial that the House never approved it, instead rolling it into a larger, broad-based spending bill.</p>
        <p>This year Republicans were determined to push the bill through. The amount allocated to the bill's discretionary programs -- nearly $6 billion less than what Mr. Clinton had requested -- was small enough to placate conservatives.</p>
        <p>Republican moderates and heads of the appropriations committees grumbled, but they held out the hope that in negotiations with the White House later this year, more money would be found for some of their pet programs.</p>
