        <p>Despite divergent professional careers, Oscar De La Hoya and Shane Mosley always seemed to be on a collision course. In the case of their welterweight championship fight Saturday night, ''Destiny'' was the perfect promotion.</p>
        <p>They grew up 30 miles apart in  Southern California, De La Hoya in East Los Angeles and Mosley in Pomona. They fought as 75-pound youngsters. They quickly rose to the top of the amateur ranks. The last time they met in the ring was when they sparred 60-plus rounds together while De La Hoya prepared for the 1992 Olympics, where he was the only U.S. boxer to win a gold medal.</p>

        <p>Despite divergent professional careers, Oscar De La Hoya and Shane Mosley always seemed to be on a collision course. In the case of their welterweight championship fight Saturday night, ''Destiny'' was the perfect promotion.</p>
        <p>They grew up 30 miles apart in  Southern California, De La Hoya in East Los Angeles and Mosley in Pomona. They fought as 75-pound youngsters. They quickly rose to the top of the amateur ranks. The last time they met in the ring was when they sparred 60-plus rounds together while De La Hoya prepared for the 1992 Olympics, where he was the only U.S. boxer to win a gold medal.</p>
        <p>Respect and friendship aside, they share a graduate degree in each other's style. Mosley (34-0, 32 knockouts) will try to take De La Hoya's World Boxing Council title with guile and quickness. In turn, De La Hoya (32-1, 26 knockouts) plans to work inside and use his power to control the fight. A sellout crowd of 21,000 is expected at the Staples Center in addition to a pay-per-view audience on TVKO beginning at 9 p.m. Eastern time.</p>
        <p>''My recollection was me always putting on the pressure,'' De La Hoya said of their sparring sessions. ''I recall being very aggressive and  setting the pace.''</p>
        <p>Mosley said, ''I can stay away from him and pick my angles. I know I can outbox him.''</p>
        <p>Mosley, the former lightweight champion, has only two fights since jumping two classes to become a 147-pound welterweight. In his debut, he scored a final-round knockout of Wilfredo Rivera, who had never been knocked out and had gone the distance against De La Hoya in 1997. Mosley also dispatched Willy Wise with a third-round technical knockout in January, before getting his shot at De La Hoya.</p>
        <p>''I have to watch for the counter left hook and the uppercut. Those are his punches,'' Mosley said. ''I think he's getting nervous,'' Mosley said of De La Hoya. ''I think he believes in his heart that I'm a welterweight now. In his comments, he contradicts himself. He's unsure about my power. I think I'm stronger than him.''</p>
        <p>Even though Mosley has never been floored in his career, he can arguably be viewed as a pumped-up lightweight, a fact that hasn't been lost in the De La Hoya camp.</p>
        <p>''The quality of experience he's faced doesn't really compare to what I've faced,'' De La Hoya said.</p>
        <p>''I feel the experience a pro fighter accumulates over the years. You can't buy that. Even though he has 34 fights, it's just not there for him, and that's something I want to take advantage of.''</p>
        <p>De La Hoya, who is two inches taller at 5 feet 11 inches, also might try to draw Mosley inside and unleash a flurry of combinations.</p>
        <p>''Shane tries to load up and use a lot of speed, but you can see it right  away and prepare for it,'' De La Hoya said. ''He's not that tricky.''</p>
