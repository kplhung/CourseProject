        <p>Benny Agbayani does not look at the lineup card. The Mets' outfielder reports to the clubhouse, goes about his business, and when the team is done stretching, he waits for the hitting coach, Tom Robson, to announce which players will participate in the first three rounds of batting practice.</p>
        <p>If Agbayani does not hear his name, he knows he is not starting.</p>
        <p>He started eight of nine games on the Mets' last road trip, but he batted .214. The Mets returned to New York, and Agbayani did not start at all in nine games.</p>
        <p>''I played for almost a week and a half, then I wasn't playing,'' Agbayani said. ''It's kind of frustrating when you don't know when you're playing and when you're not playing.''</p>
        <p>He hit home runs in his last two at-bats against the Chicago Cubs on Wednesday, and he hit another tonight at County Stadium to lead off the Mets' 7-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.</p>
        <p>Agbayani became the first Mets batter to hit home runs in three consecutive at-bats since Gary Carter in 1986.</p>
        <p>In the second inning, Agbayani added a two-run single to give the Mets a 3-0 lead and give Al Leiter more than enough run support. The Mets (36-28) won for the 11th time in 12 starts by Leiter, who improved his record to 8-1 after working eight innings, allowing three hits and striking out seven.</p>
        <p>After the game, Manager Bobby Valentine raved about Agbayani, saying: ''He's a good player and he keeps working hard. With a lot of playing time, he'd be an outstanding player in the major leagues. He just has to keep earning his playing time, I guess.''</p>
        <p>But Valentine also seemed to imply that Agbayani would not start Saturday. The rookie Jason Tyner, who was not promoted from the minors to be a reserve player, General Manager Steve Phillips has said, will start Saturday.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I'll have Jason on the bench for two days,'' Valentine said, meaning Friday and Saturday.</p>
        <p>Agbayani is one of a group of Mets who start enough to taste regular playing time but rest enough not to be satisfied. He noted that Valentine has used several players in left field this year -- nine, in fact -- but did not seem certain how he could earn a regular spot.</p>
        <p>''I'm past that stage,'' Agbayani said. ''I already tried to prove I could do it last year. This year I'm going to try to prove it again, but I guess you can't. When I get opportunities, I've got to make the best of them, because I don't know when I'm going to play again. I'm just treating every game I play like it's going to be my last.''</p>
        <p>Agbayani smashed a curveball from Jimmy Haynes (7-5) over the left-field fence in the first inning tonight, and in the second, he drove an inside sinker to right to score Jay Payton (who had three hits) and Melvin Mora.</p>
        <p>Leiter made that lead stand on another night in which he did not have his best stuff and said he had to rely more on sinking fastballs and change-ups. Leiter got six of his outs on change-ups, something he said he had never done before.</p>
        <p>''Maybe after the season, I'll look back and say this is when it happened,'' Leiter said. ''My last few starts, I feel like I have a better idea and I trust my third and fourth pitches.''</p>
        <p>Asked to give his own scouting report, Leiter gave a wide smile.</p>
        <p>The 34-year-old power pitcher, who knows he must become more well-rounded as he ages, said, ''He's becoming a crafty left-hander.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>MIKE HAMPTON, whose start was rescheduled for Sunday after he threw only one inning in a game delayed by rain Wednesday, was bumped back to next Tuesday at home to give his strained groin more time to heal. . . . ARMANDO BENITEZ has not allowed a run in his last 16 outings, allowing only two hits in 16 innings during that span and lowering his earned run average by more than three runs. Benitez has lost 15 to 20 pounds since the start of spring training and is hoping to lose 5 or 10 more. He said being in better shape helped him throw harder. ''You lose weight, you have more of a chance to do the job easy,'' he said. . . . Outfielder DARRYL HAMILTON ran the bases for the first time since having toe surgery last month, and he will start a rehabilitation assignment as soon as he gets consistent results from day to day. . . . Second baseman EDGARDO ALFONZO had three hits and scored two runs after missing Wednesday's game with a sore back. . . . The Mets are 17-3 against the Brewers since Milwaukee returned to the National League in 1998.</p>
