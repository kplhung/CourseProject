        <p>The fog disappeared, they played until darkness, and Tiger Woods kept making birdies.</p>
        <p>Punctuating his day with a fist pump and a 35-foot putt for birdie at No. 12, Woods moved to nine under par through 12 holes and led the United States Open today by three strokes when play was suspended because of darkness. And Woods, who was the first-round leader after his opening 65, was threatening to separate himself from the field.</p>
        <p>Miguel Angel Jimenez was in second place at six under par through seven holes, Thomas Bjorn of Denmark was two under through 16 holes, and Angel Cabrera of Argentina was two under through nine holes. Second-round play was scheduled to resume at 6:30 a.m. Saturday, with the third round starting after completion of the second round.</p>
        <p>Unless Woods slows down, he could turn the tournament into a runaway. He was three under par over his 12-hole stretch today, and though he made his first two bogeys of the tournament, he also made five birdies. Through his first 30 holes, he has been brilliant. And he ended the day with birdies on his last two holes, making a four-foot putt at No. 11, followed by his long putt at No. 12, which sent a roar through the gallery that remained to follow his every shot.</p>
        <p>There were other superb Woods shots along the way. His birdie at the par-5 No. 6 was set up by a shot few other players can hit: he muscled his second shot out of the rough and onto the green, with the ball coming to rest within 20 feet of the hole. Woods two-putted for the birdie, and he also made a 25-foot putt for birdie on No. 3 and a 15-foot putt for birdie at No. 7.</p>
        <p>Woods refused to say that he felt in control, although his start was reminding some people of 1997 at the Masters, when he won by 12 strokes. ''We're not even done with the second round yet,'' Woods said. ''And this course is a lot more demanding than Augusta was.''</p>
        <p>In most Open tournaments, Jimenez would be doing enough to lead, hitting fairways and greens, avoiding costly mistakes and capitalizing on opportunities. After making par on his first five holes today, he made an eight-foot putt for birdie to finish one under par during his abbreviated day.</p>
        <p>But other prominent players in pursuit of Woods fell further behind. Hal Sutton was even par through 14 holes. Jose Maria Olazabal was even par through 13 holes. Tom Lehman was even through nine holes. When play was halted, only six players remained under par, and many who expected to contend were in trouble, including Lee Westwood (four over par, 14 holes); Phil Mickelson (four over, 12 holes); Sergio Garcia and David Duval (both four over, 11 holes); and Ernie Els and Colin Montgomerie, who both completed their second round at five over par (147).</p>
        <p>Two prominent players were already out of contention -- Davis Love III (12 over), who shot an 81, and Greg Norman (17 over), who shot an 82. Both were certain to miss the second-round cut, which will be made after the completion of the second round.</p>
        <p>Bobby Clampett, a 40-year-old golf analyst for CBS who grew up just a few miles from Pebble Beach, continued to be the surprise player of the tournament at one over par through 16 holes. Many people probably expected Clampett to falter after his opening-round 68, considering that he rarely plays tournament golf and basically retired from the PGA Tour five years ago. But Clampett, who used to sneak onto Pebble Beach as a child, made the most of his local knowledge, looked confident around the greens and continued a memorable two-day experience.</p>
        <p>Woods finally made his first bogey of the tournament at the par-3 No. 5, hitting his tee shot into the right bunker, blasting out to within eight feet and missing the putt. He made his second bogey at the par-4 No. 9, missing the green on his approach shot, and failing to get up and down.</p>
        <p>Among players who finished the second round, Kirk Triplett was the clubhouse leader at one under par (141), after his even-par 71. It was an impressive round for Triplett, who reached five under par through eight holes, then hung on through the back nine, with the temperature dropping and the greens becoming more unforgiving.</p>
        <p>''We were back to the typical U.S. Open conditions, where there's hardly any guys breaking par,'' said Triplett, who won this year's Nissan Open to capture his first career victory on the PGA Tour. ''The guys breaking par are playing great, hitting phenomenal shots and great up-and-downs.''</p>
        <p>Asked how it felt to be the clubhouse leader, Triplett said, ''Do they write the check based on that?''</p>
        <p>No, they don't. And with Woods and many others still on the course, Triplett knew he would have to wait until Saturday to learn his position heading into the third round.</p>
        <p>Others who finished the second round respectably included Nick Faldo and Vijay Singh (both one over par), Lee Janzen (two over), and Fred Couples and Tom Watson (both three over).</p>
        <p>But they were all chasing Woods, who teed off at 4 p.m. and had time to do whatever he wanted to this morning -- sleep late, eat a huge breakfast, watch soap operas, or rent a movie. And when he reached the course, he continued to take care of business.</p>
        <p>''It was a long wait, but I just had to continue to play solid golf,'' Woods said afterward. ''Fortunately, I was able to do that.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>DENNIS PAULSON, winner of the Buick Classic last Sunday, withdrew because of back and rib injuries. He was nine over par (151) through two rounds.</p>
