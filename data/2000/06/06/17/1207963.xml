        <p>Gasoline prices have risen above $2 a gallon in Chicago and Milwaukee, about 25 percent higher than two months ago, angering drivers and sending political shock waves through Washington. Drivers blame retailers. Refiners blame federal regulations, the courts and OPEC. Federal regulators suspect price fixing. Some of these charges are plain wrong. Others have more merit but do not account for the whole problem.</p>
        <p>The fact that gasoline prices across the country are about 25 percent higher than they were a year ago is unsurprising. OPEC refuses to keep crude oil prices under $28 a barrel as it promised in the spring. As of June 1, refineries have been required to sell cleaner-burning gasoline -- which refiners say creates production problems. A federal court recently ruled that the Unocal Corporation could charge refiners royalties for a specific technique for producing cleaner-burning gasoline, forcing refiners to turn to more expensive methods.</p>

        <p>The fact that gasoline prices across the country are about 25 percent higher than they were a year ago is unsurprising. OPEC refuses to keep crude oil prices under $28 a barrel as it promised in the spring. As of June 1, refineries have been required to sell cleaner-burning gasoline -- which refiners say creates production problems. A federal court recently ruled that the Unocal Corporation could charge refiners royalties for a specific technique for producing cleaner-burning gasoline, forcing refiners to turn to more expensive methods.</p>
        <p>As for the particularly high prices in Chicago, industry points to problems specific to the Midwest. A broken pipeline has reduced gasoline flows by 20 percent. The Midwest relies on ethanol to satisfy a federal requirement to cut down on carbon monoxide emissions. But the use of ethanol makes it hard to also satisfy the June 1 requirements, leading to supply disruptions in the Midwest. For gasoline, it takes only a small reduction in supply to trigger large price hikes.</p>
        <p>Federal authorities are unconvinced by the industry's laying blame elsewhere. They say the companies have known about the June 1 requirements for five years. And they challenge industry estimates showing that gasoline supplies are low in the Midwest. The Federal Trade Commission will investigate price fixing. But previous investigations of the oil industry have proved fruitless.</p>
        <p>No clear explanation for $2-a-gallon gasoline may emerge. The price surge could well turn out to be the product of a combination of factors that will dissipate as quickly as they emerged.</p>
