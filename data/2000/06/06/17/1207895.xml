        <p>All is not what it seems to be in the home that is the setting for Jose Triana's ''Night of the Assassins.''</p>
        <p>In the basement, whose decor includes a makeshift altar of Christian and Caribbean religious symbols, a table and old furniture and knickknacks, a young brother and his two sisters are replaying his bloody knife-murder of their parents.</p>
        <p>Is it a wishful fantasy?</p>
        <p>And are the children really children; are the parents really parents? Or is Mr. Triana's play a subversive drama of discontent and rebellion that deals metaphorically and subversively with repressive government, stifled dreams and potential revolution?</p>
        <p>The answer is clear. The Cuban-born playwright has lived in Paris since 1980. His drama, intriguing, volatile and well acted under the direction of Max Ferra at Intar 53 through June 25, bears the reputation of having been banned in Cuba for 30 years. And it is described as the most frequently produced Latin American play in the Spanish-speaking world, where dictatorships played a large role in the 20th-century.</p>
        <p>While constructing characters that seethe with anger, particularly the young man, Lalo (Michael John Garces), Mr. Triana nimbly walks the tightrope between the narrow, familiar motivations that incite parricide and the broader strangulation of human impulses that ignites defiant politics.</p>
        <p>Throughout the play, words and phrases carry double weight and double meaning, depending on their application to the apparent murder or to the underlying politics. Accusations of spying and snooping, complaints of parents who don't allow choices, expressions of resentment against control, cries for freedom are all freighted with meaning.</p>
        <p>At the same time, ''Night of the Assassins'' displays a keen eye for a marriage gone wrong and dysfunctional parent-child relationships while finding time for humorous satire in characters like family friends, neighborhood gossips, cocky policemen and an arrogant prosecutor.</p>
        <p>Once Mr. Triana's political intent becomes manifest, much of the responsibility for maintaining the delicate chemistry that sustains the family narrative that masks fierce politics falls to the cast of three, which plays all the roles. And this they do ably, particularly Vanessa Aspillaga as Lalo's sister, Beba, who switches with seeming effortlessness from the tough to the fierce to the comic sides of the characters she is called upon to portray.</p>
        <p>Fine, too, are Mr. Garces and Sol Miranda as his sister, Cuca.</p>
        <p>If there is anything to be said for repression, it is that it breeds brave, worthy art, and ''Night of the Assassins'' is but one more example.</p>
        <p>NIGHT OF THE ASSASSINS  By Jose Triana; directed by Max Ferra; set by Van Santvoord; costumes by Mimi O'Donnell; lighting by Chris Dallos; sound by Johnna Doty; cultural consultant, Alberto Morgan; production stage manager, B. D. White. Presented by Intar Hispanic American Arts Center, Mr. Ferra, founder and artistic director. At Intar 53 Theater, 508 West 53rd Street, Clinton.</p>
        <p>WITH: Vanessa Aspillaga (Beba), Michael John Garces (Lalo) and Sol Miranda (Cuca).</p>
