        <p>Canada's inflation rate rose slightly in May to an annual rate of 2.4 percent, up from 2.1 percent in April, but comfortably below the 3 percent pace in March. The latest increase in the Consumer Price Index was less than economists had predicted and was again pushed higher mainly by the cost of gasoline. Excluding energy, core inflation in May was 1.3 percent. The modest pace suggests further interest rate increases by the Bank of Canada will only match those imposed by the Federal Reserve Board in the United States.</p>
