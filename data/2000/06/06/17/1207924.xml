        <p>In an effort to capitalize on the momentum of the Korean summit meeting, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has decided to visit South Korea next week and will stop immediately afterward in China, where officials said she would also focus on Korean developments.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright's mission in Seoul will be to bless the policies of the South Korean leader, Kim Dae Jung, that resulted in the summit accord and to stress that the United States supported the ultimate goal of reunification, officials said.</p>
        <p>''The main objective of direct North and South Korean dialogue is that if you can move the discussion on reunification, you begin to get momentum on other issues,'' an administration official said. ''There are opportunities here we don't want to miss.''</p>
        <p>The major issues for the United States include North Korea's long-range ballistic missile program, for which the administration has proposed a $60 billion missile defense system.</p>
        <p>A senior United States official is to meet North Korean officials at the end of the month to try to persuade Pyongyang to agree to a permanent moratorium on the flight testing of its long-range missile.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the administration will publish in The Federal Register the provisions of a broad lifting of economic sanctions that have been in place since North Korea invaded the South 50 years ago. President Clinton announced the easing of sanctions in September as a reward for North Korea's suspending missile testing while talks proceeded on a more permanent ban.</p>
        <p>In a sign of the importance that the Clinton administration places on the broad accord that North and South Korea reached, the national security adviser of South Korea, Hwang Won Tak, who attended the summit meeting, briefed Mr. Clinton today in New York.</p>
        <p>On Thursday night, Kim Dae Jung, who is receiving accolades from United States officials for the success of his ''sunshine policy'' toward the North, telephoned Mr. Clinton to tell him details of the meeting, a senior administration official said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright, who had been planning to visit China next month for probably her last visit there as secretary, pushed forward that trip so she could encourage Beijing to continue to be helpful on North Korea. The United States and China have some shared interests on the Korean peninsula, primarily in avoiding armed conflict between the North and South.</p>
