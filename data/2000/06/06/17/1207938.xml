        <p>The Russian media magnate Vladimir A. Gusinsky was released from a Moscow jail tonight, four days after an arrest that raised alarms about the prospects for press freedom in Russia and presented President Vladimir V. Putin with the first political challenge of his young presidency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky, the 47-year-old owner of Media-Most, a group of influential newspaper, radio and television interests that has at times been harshly critical of the Kremlin, left the shabby Butyrka prison in Moscow about 10 p.m. after signing a letter promising not to leave the capital.</p>
        <p>Looking both tired and agitated, Mr. Gusinsky arrived later at his company headquarters in the center of the city, where after stopping to greet reporters he disappeared inside to meet with his top managers.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Mr. Gusinsky was formally charged with ''large-scale embezzlement'' in connection with the 1996 privatization of a St. Petersburg television station, in which Media-Most  bought 70 percent of the shares.</p>
        <p>The investigation, now in its second year, has been widely seen in Russia as a pretext for a final act in a long-running power struggle between the Kremlin and Mr. Gusinsky.</p>
        <p>Russian authorities have denied any political overtones to the arrest, but at a news conference on Thursday in Berlin, Mr. Putin said he thought Russia's prosecutor general had gone ''too far'' in arresting and jailing Mr. Gusinsky.</p>
        <p>However, at another news conference today in Berlin, Mr. Putin said he had no reason to believe that the prosecutor's office had acted ''unlawfully.'' He also noted that Mr. Gusinsky would be eligible for release under a recent amnesty that applies to people who have been awarded special government honors. Mr. Putin, who is on a weeklong foreign trip, left Germany today for the former Soviet republic of Moldova, and is to return to Moscow on Saturday.</p>
        <p>In a statement tonight, the prosecutor's office said it had accepted Mr. Gusinsky's request for release on the basis of an Order of Friendship award, granted to him by the Russian government in 1994.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Mr. Putin stressed that he would not interfere in the investigation, which is being handled by Russia's prosecuting authority, which is an independent office under the Russian Constitution.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Gusinsky's lawyers had expected their client to be released today. Appearing tonight on NTV, the television station that is the flagship of Mr. Gusinsky's company, Genri Reznik, one of his lawyers, scoffed at the idea of an ''independent'' prosecutor general in Russia. He recalled the role played by Mr. Putin, then head of Russia's internal security agency, in the Kremlin's clumsy efforts last year to dismiss Yuri I. Skuratov, a prosecutor general who tried to investigate corruption in the Kremlin and was humiliated when a sexually explicit videotape involving him was shown on state television.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reznik described the charges against Mr. Gusinsky as absurd, intended to ensnare him in a lengthy and pointless legal process with the goal of ''breaking him psychologically and liquidating his business.''</p>
        <p>The Gusinsky case is expected to take on political dimensions on Wednesday when the Russian Parliament reconvenes. Some political leaders have already said the controversy may affect support for the president's legislative effort to tighten the Kremlin's control over regional governors.</p>
        <p>The arrest has already aroused protests from politicians, journalists and business leaders, both Russian and foreign. American Jewish leaders and 52 members of Congress had appealed to Mr. Putin to release Mr. Gusinsky, who is also the head of the Russian Jewish Congress.</p>
        <p>The Gusinsky case has proved to be an embarrassment for Mr. Putin on his trip abroad, where first in Spain and then in Germany he has had to face questions about why Mr. Gusinsky was singled out for prosecution in a country where most business is practiced on the edge of the law.</p>
        <p>Several people, including Boris A. Berezovsky, another of Russia's more prominent financiers and an archrival of Mr. Gusinsky, have noted that in the free-for-all that has passed for a free market here, virtually all Russian business leaders have broken the law at one time or another.</p>
        <p>The case against Mr. Gusinsky is pinned to an investigation into Russian Video, a television station in St. Petersburg that was privatized by its general director, Dmitri Rozhdestvensky, who has been in jail for two years pending a trial.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for Media-Most have insisted that Mr. Gusinsky and his company were not involved in the privatization of the state-owned station. But according to newspaper accounts, the investigation has focused on the low price Media-Most paid for its shares in the company -- then the equivalent of $5,000 -- and on an alleged $1 million kickback paid to Mr. Rozhdestvensky. The prosecutor's office has said that the alleged value of property embezzled from the state is $10 million.</p>
        <p>But according to Mr. Gusinsky's lawyers, the charges presented today were vague and broad.</p>
        <p>''What they actually mean is that all entrepreneurial structure including Media-Most created by Gusinsky were created with the criminal goal of robbing the state,'' Mr. Reznik said in a television interview. ''What is remarkable now is that the very fact of turning a company into a joint-stock company is considered a crime.''</p>
