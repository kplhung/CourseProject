        <p>Total magic is what Rinde Eckert delivers in ''And God Created Great Whales,'' a production of the Foundry Theater Company that opened Sunday evening at the Bessie Schonberg Theater for a two-week run. He has the gift of writing both words and music very well, and from one moment to the next for 75 intense minutes he delightfully subverts every expectation he arouses.</p>
        <p>Consider the story: an indifferent composer is losing his mind. Acutely aware of his fate, he has taped instructions to himself to guide him through every step of the great work of his life before darkness falls. Trapped in his studio, the only person he can talk to is a woman who, his tape reminds him, is a figment of his imagination. The tape's repeated warnings -- ''if you are listening this far into the recording your disease is growing worse'' -- continually raise apprehension for the man, who visibly deteriorates in front of us. And what is the composition he struggles to complete? An opera of ''Moby- Dick.'' So this musical play seems to be about the mad summoning up the mad. But that's not it.</p>

        <p>Total magic is what Rinde Eckert delivers in ''And God Created Great Whales,'' a production of the Foundry Theater Company that opened Sunday evening at the Bessie Schonberg Theater for a two-week run.

        <p>Consider the story: an indifferent composer is losing his mind. Acutely aware of his fate, he has taped instructions to himself to guide him through every step of the great work of his life before darkness falls. Trapped in his studio, the only person he can talk to is a woman who, his tape reminds him, is a figment of his imagination. The tape's repeated warnings -- ''if you are listening this far into the recording your disease is growing worse'' -- continually raise apprehension for the man, who visibly deteriorates in front of us. And what is the composition he struggles to complete? An opera of ''Moby- Dick.'' So this musical play seems to be about the mad summoning up the mad. But that's not it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eckert, as Nathan the composer, looks like a great ruin, something Piranesi might have dreamed up had he done portraits. But he has a command of gesture that lets him fly from fear to fury and from dancing to dying in an instant. To watch Nathan degenerate from a nimble prankster to a blank lump is scarcely bearable. And Mr. Eckert's singing, whether in falsetto or baritone, can be thrilling. To hear him intone Father Mapple's sermon on Noah from the Melville novel is to be lifted out of time; to witness his Ahab howling for blood as the storm and the ghost of a whale shatter his ship is sheer terror.</p>
        <p>Vocally and dramatically he is wonderfully matched by Nora Cole as the figment of his imagination. The presence, the voice and the energy that have made her a star on Broadway can be seductive and threatening at once in a small room. And here she seems to summon up some of the great gospel singers; there are depths in her voice in dark moments that haunt the ear for hours.</p>
        <p>But it is not the dark moments in this play that reveal how serious Mr. Eckert is. He is a wary explorer of mindlessness in theater and a fiendish detective of moribund trends in opera. Biting jokes average about two a minute in ''Great Whales'' -- a few of them verbal, but more captured in sight and most of them expressed in music. After you have heard Mr. Eckert describe in a few notes on piano each of a dozen Melville characters Ms. Cole names, you will find it very hard to sit through almost any opera I can think of without laughing once in a while. And as Nathan approaches some of the grander scenes in his version of ''Moby-Dick,'' the barely suppressed parody of modern productions of grand opera is simply exquisite. Of course, Mr. Eckert delights in not being a purist; he will reach all the way out to rap for a reference that lets his audience hear his mockery. And his use of recorded sound -- through big speakers and also through hand-held tape machines -- along with piano and voice let his sly laughter resonate high and low. His success is huge; there is not a musical joke here that will elude even people who can't read a note.</p>
        <p>David Schweizer, the director, creates a rhythm that is palpably musical to bind together the narrative, the opera in the throes of labor and the playwright's incisive criticism. There is a constant sense of opening up -- intellectually, emotionally and visually -- until the performance comes over as a piercing examination of intelligence itself and of the unpredictable courses it follows in any human life.</p>
        <p>The set and lighting by Kevin Adams give a clue from the outset that, despite its grim material, this play is no solemn affair. Nathan's grand piano rests not on legs but on crates and boxes, the whole ensemble tied  with ropes, like cargo lashed to a deck against wind and wave. Recorders and other technoprops of modern sound hang from booms above. The stage seems held in an undulating net of bare colored bulbs that telegraph a code of their own as sun rises, storm falls or hell breaks loose. At the end they are employed like paint brushes when Ahab's storm crashes to an end, Nathan's tape tells him ''if you are still listening it is too late'' and Nathan, still as a stone, sits in a white glow at the back of the stage as if watching, alone and uncomprehending on shore, while we out in the dark float away.</p>
        <p>The emotion that washes over the audience is astonished satisfaction, as though we had done it all ourselves.</p>
        <p>AND GOD CREATED GREAT WHALES  Written and composed by Rinde Eckert; directed by David Schweizer; set and lighting by Kevin Adams; sound by James Rattazzi; costumes by Clint E. B.
