        <p>Editorial urges New York Legislature to pass hate-crime bill</p>

        <p>For 11 years the New York State Assembly has passed bills to increase punishment for bias-related crimes committed against gays and minority members. For that entire time, Republicans in the State Senate have blocked the legislation because they were unwilling to include gays as a protected group in any hate-crime bill.</p>
        <p>This month, at the request of Gov. George Pataki, the Senate finally dropped its objections and approved a bill increasing penalties for crimes that single out victims because of their race, gender, national origin, age, disability or sexual orientation. But now this effort may be jeopardized because of a ridiculous contest of egos and credit-taking in which the two houses appear to be engaged.</p>

        <p>This month, at the request of Gov. George Pataki, the Senate finally dropped its objections and approved a bill increasing penalties for crimes that single out victims because of their race, gender, national origin, age, disability or sexual orientation. But now this effort may be jeopardized because of a ridiculous contest of egos and credit-taking in which the two houses appear to be engaged.</p>
        <p>The Senate passed the governor's bill, and insists that it will not vote on any other bill. The Assembly, which passed its own bill, has not approved the Senate legislation, perhaps because it has championed this issue for years and does not want the Senate to get credit now for producing the final legislation. There is some difference in the language of the two bills, but they would both achieve the same goal -- increasing punishment for crimes driven by hatred.</p>
        <p>There should be no difficulty reaching a workable compromise. The legislative leaders need to start behaving like grown-ups, stop this spat and enact a measure that has been held up by politics for more than a decade.</p>
