        <p>For two seasons, Kerry Kittles played with what most observers believed was only a nagging injury. He complained of chronic soreness in his right knee and how it was responsible for his decreased production. When Kittles sat out the Nets' training camp and 13 of the first 14 games last season, some members of the organization whispered about his lack of toughness and commitment.</p>
        <p>But it turns out that his knee is damaged so badly that his career might be in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, two days after his 26th birthday, Kittles underwent surgery to resurface the cartilage in the knee. It was the fourth time his right knee has been operated on since 1997.</p>
        <p>While the Nets termed the operation successful, no timetable was announced for his return, and Kittles could not be reached for comment. Kittles will not be able to bear weight on his leg for an extended period before undergoing arduous rehabilitation.</p>
        <p>Rod Thorn, the Nets' new president, said he did not know if the shooting guard would be able to play next season.</p>
        <p>He's going to be out for quite a while, whether that's the whole season or part of the season, Thorn said. The doctors feel that he has every opportunity to come back. But he's had three operations in two years, and you never want to minimize a situation like that.</p>
