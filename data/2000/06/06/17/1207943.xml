        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan today certified Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon, opening the way to a more robust United Nations peacekeeping presence along Lebanon's often troubled border with Israel.</p>
        <p>''This is not the end of the long road toward peace in the region, but I hope it will be seen as the beginning of the end,'' said Mr. Annan, who promptly departed on a weeklong trip to a half-dozen countries in the Middle East to discuss ways for the United Nations to build on the achievement.</p>
        <p>The certification was challenged a few hours later when Lebanon's prime minister, Salim Hoss, contended in Beirut that Israeli troops still controlled some parts of the border area. He did not identify the areas or their size, or threaten to withhold cooperation with the United Nations peacekeepers.</p>
        <p>The secretary general's confirmation of the Israeli pullout to the Security Council is significant because it credits Israel with fulfilling an essential condition of Resolution 425, which the council passed in 1978. The resolution demanded that Israeli troops pull out of the territory they had just occupied in southern Lebanon to create a security buffer zone. Now, Mr. Annan says, Israel has done just that.</p>
        <p>With that accomplished, the 22-year-old resolution authorizes United Nations peacekeepers to be deployed across southern Lebanon to help the Lebanese government restore peace and security in the area and reassert its lost authority.</p>
        <p>In doing so, the United Nations appeared to be embarking on yet another peacekeeping operation at a time when its financial and troop resources are already thinly stretched. As of this month, the United Nations had 35,469 military personnel and police officers deployed in 14 peacekeeping operations around the world.</p>
        <p>But unlike another operation being planned for Congo, the mission in southern Lebanon offers unusually high prospects for success at comparatively modest physical risk.</p>
        <p>''This is a happy day for Lebanon, but also for Israel,'' Mr. Annan said. ''And it is a day of pride for the United Nations. It shows that U.N. resolutions, when fully implemented by all parties working together, can be the building blocks of peace.''</p>
        <p>But Prime Minister Hoss said in a statement released in Beirut: ''There are still several Israeli military outposts inside the Lebanese border. And there are several tracts of Lebanese territory under Israeli control in a flagrant act of encroachment.'' He did not specify where the tracts were.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, Lebanon's president, Emile Lahoud, warned that his country might not recognize the United Nations findings if they were ''confined to a fictitious nonexisting line that does not reach the existing internationally recognized frontier.''</p>
        <p>The secretary general and other officials have repeatedly stressed that the United Nations is not demarcating the border between Lebanon and Israel but merely confirming the line to which the Israelis have withdrawn. This has meant verifying Israel's pull-back across a frontier imperfectly defined in 1923, with subsequent small adjustments, according to contemporary maps.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Annan telephoned Mr. Lahoud today to allay his concerns, the announcement went ahead. But the mixed signals seem unlikely to be clarified before Mr. Annan visits Beirut in a few days.</p>
        <p>During the inspection of the border, Lebanese officials have repeatedly expressed reservations, and then supported the United Nations effort. Some diplomats here suggested that the complaints of Mr. Hoss and Mr. Lahoud were in good part for domestic consumption, to assure the Lebanese people that their government will not cede any border territory.</p>
        <p>One diplomat here said that Lebanon was worried that the Israelis might try to turn the line of withdrawal identified by the United Nations into their international border, causing the Lebanese to forfeit some land.</p>
        <p>Until now, the peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, called by its acronym, Unifil, was largely limited to looking on -- and ducking -- while Islamic guerrillas in southern Lebanon fired artillery and rockets into northern Israel and the Israelis retaliated with airstrikes and cross-border raids. The peacekeepers can now occupy fixed positions and conduct mobile patrols along the border.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan confirmed that the peacekeepers' main task now would be to help the Lebanese government and its armed forces assume their responsibilities along the border and throughout the area that Israel has vacated.</p>
        <p>The secretary general's special representative in the region, Terje Roed-Larsen, said that the peacekeeping mission would be expanded to 5,600 troops, from the 4,400 now stationed in southern Lebanon, in the first two weeks of July.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roed-Larsen, who was entrusted with handling the complex and politically sensitive verification process, said that the Lebanese government has already deployed 1,000 soldiers and internal security troops in the border area.</p>
        <p>In his announcement, the secretary general said he hoped that the international community would help Lebanon rebuild its economy in the south and re-establish ties to the rest of the country. ''This will help move the whole country closer to peace and stability,'' Mr. Annan said.</p>
        <p>He also expressed hope that the successful implementation of the  council's resolution on Lebanon would encourage others in the Middle East, ''especially Syrians, Palestinians and Israelis, as well as Lebanese,'' to move faster in negotiating other peace treaties based on two earlier council resolutions, which also called for Israel's complete withdrawal from occupied Arab land.</p>
        <p>The withdrawal from southern Lebanon got under way after Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, set a self-imposed deadline of July 7 for Israeli troops to leave. When the Israelis started pulling out last month ahead of schedule, their allies, the surrogate Southern Lebanese Army, collapsed, abandoning heavy weapons and fortifications to the guerrillas and forcing the Israelis to accelerate their departure.</p>
