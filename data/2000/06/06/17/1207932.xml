        <p>Despite a sharp slowdown in domestic stock and bond markets, Lehman Brothers Holdings reported yesterday that its fiscal second-quarter earnings rose 15 percent from a year earlier, though they were 33 percent lower than in the previous quarter.</p>
        <p>Lehman, the fourth-biggest securities firm, said it had net income of $378 million in the quarter, up from $330 million in the corresponding period in 1999 but down from a record $541 million in the first quarter of 2000. On a diluted basis, its earnings were $2.78 a share, compared with $2.09 a year earlier and with analysts' lowered consensus estimate of $2.49 for the quarter.</p>

        <p>Despite a sharp slowdown in domestic stock and bond markets, Lehman Brothers Holdings reported yesterday that its fiscal second-quarter earnings rose 15 percent from a year earlier, though they were 33 percent lower than in the previous quarter.</p>
        <p>Lehman, the fourth-biggest securities firm, said it had net income of $378 million in the quarter, up from $330 million in the corresponding period in 1999 but down from a record $541 million in the first quarter of 2000. On a diluted basis, its earnings were $2.78 a share, compared with $2.09 a year earlier and with analysts' lowered consensus estimate of $2.49 for the quarter.</p>
        <p>Much of Lehman's gains came from stock trading at home and in Europe, where the firm has been building its investment banking and trading operations. Lehman derived 49 percent of its revenue from outside the United States in the quarter, up from 37 percent a year earlier, said David Goldfarb, its chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>''We saw some extraordinary strength in trading profitability considering the market environment we were in,'' said Guy Moszkowski, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst. Mr. Moszkowski said Lehman's results boded well for two bigger competitors that are scheduled to report earnings next week, the Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.</p>
        <p>''The second quarter will turn out to have been quite strong really, considering the kind of market conditions we had,'' he said. But, he added, ''I still think we're looking at a much weaker third quarter than we've seen.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldfarb said that the quarter had a split personality: for the first several weeks, starting in March, the stock markets were on a tear and investment banks were underwriting new stock issues as fast as they could. Then, after technology stocks took a dive in mid-April, business slowed markedly, though investors rushed to adjust their portfolios for the end -- at least temporarily -- of the run-up in technology stocks.</p>
        <p>Throughout the quarter, concerns about rising interest rates bogged down the bond markets, the traditional source of most of Lehman's revenue. Of the $1.76 billion in revenue last quarter, only about 30 percent came from trading and underwriting bonds, Lehman said.</p>
        <p>''If anybody still had a thought process that we're a fixed-income house, this should be a wake-up call that we're a diversified investment bank,'' Mr. Goldfarb said.</p>
        <p>For the second consecutive quarter, Lehman spent about 52 cents of every dollar it took in on compensation and benefits for its 9,300 employees. Like other Wall Street firms, Lehman has had to increase pay and perks to retain and attract young investment bankers. Mr. Goldfarb said Lehman was also spending heavily on new technology and an Internet-based system for communicating and trading with clients.</p>
        <p>The Internet proved treacherous for Lehman last week when the firm discovered that www.secinfo.com, a Web site for investors, was still publishing a long list of the firm's investments that had been filed erroneously with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
        <p>In mid-May, Lehman sent a standard quarterly filing to the S.E.C. that was supposed to contain a list of its biggest stock holdings, totaling about $5 billion. Instead, it sent a much longer list of about $25 billion of positions, including currency contracts and stock options it had purchased as bets that certain stocks would either rise or fall.</p>
        <p>Normally, big investors like Lehman closely guard such information out of fear that other investors will use it for their own trading purposes. Lehman thought it had erased the first filing when the S.E.C. deleted it and replaced it with a corrected one, but secinfo.com has a policy of providing all versions of such documents.</p>
        <p>Last week, a Lehman lawyer asked the site's operators to remove the original filing. At first, they complied. But then, thinking like Wall Street traders, they reposted the document and asked Lehman to make them an offer to remove it. Lehman chose not to bid.</p>
