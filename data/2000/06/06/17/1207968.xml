        <p>If you wanted to pick the two people on the American cultural landscape least likely to share a headline, you couldn't do much better than Bruce Springsteen and Laura Schlessinger. Mr. Springsteen is The Boss, a pillar of humanity in rock. Ms. Schlessinger is merely bossy -- a mean-spirited ''doctor'' (in physiology, not psychology) who dispenses authoritarian advice to pathetic lonelyhearts desperate enough to seek family counseling from a call-in radio show.</p>
        <p>But at this peculiar moment this odd couple have one thing in common, besides loud voices and huge audiences: powerful forces are campaigning to make them both shut up. Dr. Laura, who has labeled homosexuality as ''deviant'' and a ''biological error,'' has drawn months of protests from gay civil rights groups hoping to persuade sponsors and Paramount to dump the new syndicated TV show she is to start this fall. Mr. Springsteen, who is performing a song called ''American Skin'' about the shooting of Amadou Diallo, was labeled a ''dirtbag'' and ''floating fag'' by the head of the New York State chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police and is also the target of a boycott. The New York Post went so far as to argue that the lyrics of ''American Skin'' might ''nurture a growing acceptance of violent crime.''</p>

        <p>If you wanted to pick the two people on the American cultural landscape least likely to share a headline, you couldn't do much better than Bruce Springsteen and Laura Schlessinger. Mr. Springsteen is The Boss, a pillar of humanity in rock. Ms. Schlessinger is merely bossy -- a mean-spirited ''doctor'' (in physiology, not psychology) who dispenses authoritarian advice to pathetic lonelyhearts desperate enough to seek family counseling from a call-in radio show.</p>
        <p>But at this peculiar moment this odd couple have one thing in common, besides loud voices and huge audiences: powerful forces are campaigning to make them both shut up. Dr. Laura, who has labeled homosexuality as ''deviant'' and a ''biological error,'' has drawn months of protests from gay civil rights groups hoping to persuade sponsors and Paramount to dump the new syndicated TV show she is to start this fall. Mr. Springsteen, who is performing a song called ''American Skin'' about the shooting of Amadou Diallo, was labeled a ''dirtbag'' and ''floating fag'' by the head of the New York State chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police and is also the target of a boycott. The New York Post went so far as to argue that the lyrics of ''American Skin'' might ''nurture a growing acceptance of violent crime.''</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of anger out there about speech,'' says Floyd Abrams, the First Amendment lawyer who led the Brooklyn Museum's successful defense against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's effort to squelch its ''Sensation'' exhibit. ''The sound of censorship is in the air, and it cuts across political lines.''</p>
        <p>The sounds of silencing are in fact rapidly becoming a roar. Such is the censorious impulse, you'd think we were in the midst of a Red Scare or widespread social unrest -- not in an utterly bland peace-and-prosperity presidential campaign. There are movements in 17 states to keep Harry Potter books from kids because they contain witchcraft and violence, according to the American Library Association. Religious-right groups went ballistic over an innocuous and now-defunct NBC cartoon series titled ''God, the Devil and Bob.'' The Web site TomPaine.com has hectored journalists (myself among them) to boycott the sometimes racially and sexually profane Don Imus radio show, and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill is protesting the new Jim Carrey gross-out comedy, ''Me, Myself &amp; Irene,'' for its insensitivity. Next up for outrage from every watchdog organization across the entire ideological spectrum: Eminem, a charismatic white rapper whose new No. 1 CD trades in violence, crude sex and invective roughing up heterosexual women, lesbians and gay men.</p>
        <p>Dr. Laura isn't as nasty (or talented) as Eminem, but she's a bigoted bully and is herself no defender of the First Amendment, which she has derided (''It is not the Eleventh Commandment'') when invoked by those who disagree with her. Yet the escalating vehemence of the protest against her makes me uncomfortable when it mirrors the tactics used by those on her side who fought to keep the openly gay Ellen DeGeneres's eponymous sitcom off the air three years ago.</p>
        <p>Anti-Laura advocates argue that the cases aren't parallel. Dr. Laura doesn't star in a sitcom but is a pseudo-medical authority whose oral prescriptions may lead directly to the punitive treatment of gay people. Perhaps. But the more I've heard Dr. Laura, the more I'd argue that she is essentially another brand of entertainer whose shrill shtick is only likely to be taken literally by those who share her antediluvian views in the first place. I'd rather see her go on TV uncensored and widely ridiculed (as she has been on ''Frasier'') than see a boycott by the Southern Baptist Convention silence next season's prime-time series with John Goodman as a sympathetic gay parent.</p>
        <p>But if the loud calls for squelching Dr. Laura sound hypocritical coming from liberals who often deride the same tactics from ''family values'' censors, the sudden embrace of the First Amendment by her defenders has been even more ludicrous. It's hard for the right, which has relentlessly called for the neutering of everything from ''South Park'' to ''Dogma'' to ''WWF Smackdown!'' to explain why it now is in favor of untrammeled free speech for Dr. Laura. But when there's a will -- and a political ally involved -- there's a rationalization. One amusing recent effort to grab the moral high ground, concocted by the commentator Michael Medved, has been to argue that ''when conservatives boycott, they tend to boycott because of obscenity,'' while the liberal anti-Laura campaign is ''based upon [her] opinion.'' But what's obscene about Harry Potter? Or Mr. Springsteen's plaintive narrative of the Diallo case?</p>
        <p>The other conservative tack is to play the victim card and argue that Dr. Laura -- and her current companion in trash talk, John Rocker -- are victims of political correctness run amok, martyrs to ''McCarthyism of the left.'' The Rocker flap, according to a Dennis Prager rant in The Weekly Standard, is ''a case study in liberal hysteria.'' I don't disagree that some of the response to this baseball player's ignorant ramblings has been over the top, but no more so than the right's the-sky-is-falling reaction to an Off Broadway play like ''Corpus Christi'' or a sitcom like ''Ellen,'' both case studies in conservative hysteria.</p>
        <p>Political correctness is always in the eye of the beholder. Conservatives and liberals use the same arguments to defend the free speech of their un-p.c. ideological bedfellows: Dr. Laura's demeaning remarks about gay people are justified as arising out of her deep spiritual convictions, much as liberals cited Chris Ofili's Nigerian heritage in accounting for his ritualistic use of elephant dung in ''The Holy Virgin Mary.'' As the right makes the excuse that John Rocker is the half-innocent product of his hick background, so the pop-music press portrays Eminem as the tortured product of his harsh urban childhood.</p>
        <p>It all makes for a healthy and rowdy, if sometimes predictable, debate; what's disturbing, says Joan Bertin of the National Coalition Against Censorship, is the rising eagerness of all sides ''to obliterate from public view something they find offensive.'' Offensive speech is too often conflated with hateful acts.</p>
        <p>''It's a human reaction to want to suppress speech with which we disagree,'' says Floyd Abrams, ''but it is contrary to the spirit of the First Amendment and the broader spirit of living in an open society. Dr. Laura at her worst, which is very bad indeed, does not come close to advocating violence. The people offended by her have First Amendment rights too, and exposing her is a good thing. Suppressing her speech is wrong-headed and dangerous.''</p>
        <p>In a cacophonous First Amendment world, ugly speech often backfires anyway. Charlton Heston's sonorous threat to cling to his last musket with his ''cold, dead hands'' has probably done more to speed gun control than any silencing of him or the N.R.A. could ever accomplish. The religious right's homophobia has cost it and the G.O.P. votes in each successive election. It's entirely possible that Dr. Laura will go bust on TV faster than Rush Limbaugh did. As Michael Harrison, editor of the trade journal Talkers, observes, Ms. Schlessinger's ''veins-in-the-neck tautness'' is hardly a sure bet to translate from an aural to a visual medium.</p>
        <p>What remains mystifying to First Amendment advocates I've talked to is why there should be this much censorship in the air now. As Mr. Abrams asks: ''Why is it happening when through the Internet we're rapidly moving into an era when more is being said than ever before and more people will be saying it?''</p>
        <p>Maybe that is the reason. At this time of anxiety-making technological change, this may be the last chance for any group to stand its ground before the ground shifts unrecognizably beneath it. In that sense, the effort to stop any legally protected form of speech is increasingly becoming an academic exercise. With or without Paramount, Dr. Laura will have a myriad of electronic forums on the coming broadband Web in digital perpetuity, just as Eminem and Springsteen songs will keep being disseminated through Napster regardless of who stages what boycott against them. It's the paradox of our historical moment that even as the clamor grows to suppress offensive speech, we are speeding into the first century in which doing so may well be impossible.</p>
