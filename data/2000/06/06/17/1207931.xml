        <p>James Billington, the Librarian of Congress and a historian of Russian culture, has come up with a simple but effective way of advancing democracy in Russia. Borrowing a page from the Marshall Plan, which brought young German politicians to the United States after World War II, Mr. Billington has devised a program that gives thousands of Russian civic leaders a chance to see the American political and economic system at work. With $10 million from Congress last summer, and a similar amount this year, the Russian Leadership Program offers Russians -- many under 40 years old -- a brief but intense encounter with a noisy, often messy but remarkably open form of governance.</p>
        <p>An effort like this is easily overshadowed by the great political and military issues that dominate relations between Washington and Moscow, and $10 million is a microscopic dot in the annual federal budget. But from no-frills programs like this can come invaluable gains, including the development of a generation of Russian leaders who better understand the workings of an independent judiciary or the benefits of private property. This summer's 2,000 or so visitors, including 130 members of the Russian Parliament, will divide into specialized groups that concentrate on subjects like banking, taxation, the rule of law, agriculture and other topics relevant to the development of Russian democracy. After a few days in Washington the participants will disperse to cities and towns in nearly every state, where they will be housed in the homes of their hosts and get a firsthand look at the work of mayors, judges, doctors, teachers, farmers and political party activists, among others.</p>

        <p>''The story of America is better than the theory of America,'' Mr. Billington likes to say. By inviting Russians here to experience the story, he and his Congressional sponsors, most notably Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, are making an important investment in Russia's future.</p>
