        <p>Op-Ed article by New York City police lieutenant George Mole says he did not expect that Bruce Springsteen, poet of the working class, would turn his back on working men and women who wear the shield, as he has done with 'shallow and unbalanced' song about death of Amadou Diallo (M)</p>

        <p>Not long ago, sitting with a friend in her parked car, I opened a new CD and put it into the player. She had never heard Bruce Springsteen sing ''Drive All Night,'' and that was intolerable.</p>
        <p>This is his best song, I told her, and you'll never hear it played on the radio. For eight raw minutes Springsteen puts his heart on the table, singing of desperation and love, pain and redemption, reaching a level of emotion that leaves the listener drained, moved, changed.</p>

        <p>Not long ago, sitting with a friend in her parked car, I opened a new CD and put it into the player. She had never heard Bruce Springsteen sing ''Drive All Night,'' and that was intolerable.</p>
        <p>This is his best song, I told her, and you'll never hear it played on the radio. For eight raw minutes Springsteen puts his heart on the table, singing of desperation and love, pain and redemption, reaching a level of emotion that leaves the listener drained, moved, changed.</p>
        <p>I was sharing a work of art that meant something to me, one of my favorite things to do, especially when the artist is someone I admire. Unfortunately, the admiration doesn't seem to be mutual. Bruce Springsteen's empathy and understanding do not appear to extend to people like me: police officers.</p>
        <p>Cops are used to being despised, not only by the predators we arrest but -- it often seems -- by the society we protect. But I didn't expect that Bruce Springsteen, poet of the working class, would turn his back on the working men and women who wear the shield.</p>
        <p>Springsteen has written an amazingly shallow and unbalanced song about the death of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed man shot and killed by four New York City police officers in February of last year. The song, ''American Skin (41 Shots),'' has been performed at his most recent concerts, including the current shows in New York.</p>
        <p>''American Skin'' begins with a scene in which a woman -- it's implied she is black -- tells her son that if he is stopped by the police, he must ''always be polite/Never ever run away,/Promise me you'll keep your hands in sight.'' Of course, people have always given their children these instructions, based on the belief that police officers should be respected and obeyed. But the implication here is that cops are dangerous animals who must not be provoked.</p>
        <p>Then comes the refrain, ''It ain't no secret . . . You can get killed just for living in your American skin'' -- implying, viciously, that the police killed Amadou Diallo because he was black.</p>
        <p>This lack of understanding is nothing new. Certainly, almost every media commentator, politician and civil rights activist speaks with the same ignorance. But it's shocking to hear from a once great student of human beings.</p>
        <p>We must remind ourselves that Amadou Diallo's race was relevant only in that cops approached him because he fit the general description of a man who had committed numerous rapes. When approached by the officers he ducked into a vestibule. And in that vestibule, the police said he appeared to pull a dark object from his pocket, which the officers mistook for a gun.</p>
        <p>Can Springsteen not see that the four officers, like Amadou Diallo himself, were working men who wanted to go home that night, who wanted to see their families again?</p>
        <p>I've enjoyed Springsteen's music for many years, but that pleasure is gone now. I can no longer relate to an artist who in his work shows contempt for me and my fellow officers.</p>
