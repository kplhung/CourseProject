        <p>James Brown, Glenn Frey and Don Henley of the Eagles along with  Curtis Mayfield, James Taylor and Brian Wilson became members of the Songwriters' Hall of Fame on Thursday night in a ceremony at the Imperial Ballroom of the Sheraton New York Hotel.</p>
        <p>It was the National Academy of Popular Music's 31st annual induction into a hall that is about to have its first tangible home. Until now, the hall had essentially been a list, an annual awards ceremony and a plaque for members.</p>
        <p>The lyricist Hal David, the organization's chairman and chief executive, said on Thursday that the hall's museum would occupy 6,000 square feet, with its own entrance, in a New York University dormitory now under construction on East 14th Street. It is on the former site of the Palladium, between Irving Plaza and Third Avenue, and is to be completed within the next two years.</p>
        <p>A Web site with information about the hall's 310 members and other awards is to be created by the end of this year.</p>
        <p>The National Academy of Popular Music, founded by the lyricist Johnny Mercer, started out as a bastion of Tin Pan Alley-style songwriting; Frank Sinatra was its honorary  chairman of the board. Its members are chosen by the academy's board of directors.</p>
        <p>The hall has been supported by music publishing companies and licensing organizations that seek recognition for behind-the scenes songwriters, not just performers. But this year all its new members are singer-songwriters from the ranks of rock  and soul, and they are all members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Mr. Henley and Mr. Frey did not attend; Mr. Mayfield died in 1999.</p>
        <p>For its ceremony, the songwriters' hall picked up an idea from the rock hall of fame: an all-star jam session. On a stage packed with new members and presenters, Paul McCartney, who had given the award to Mr. Wilson, upstaged Ben E. King to trade shouts and dance steps with Mr. Brown in ''Stand by Me''; Aaron Neville, Bobby Womack, Mr. Taylor and the swing singer Keely Smith stepped forward in ''Kansas City'' and a reprise of ''Stand by Me.'' Carole King, Brian McKnight, Phoebe Snow, Jill Sobule and the three brothers in Hanson were among those singing along onstage.</p>
        <p>Both songs were written by Jerry Lieber and Mike Stoller (along with Mr. King for ''Stand by Me''), longtime hall members who were given additional recognition on Thursday with the hall's Johnny Mercer award. ''Two guys never deserved it more,'' Mr. Lieber said.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCartney said that Mr. Wilson's music in the 1960's had deeply affected him. ''When I played it, it made me cry, and I don't know why,'' Mr. McCartney said. ''It's a sign of great genius to be able to do that with a bunch of words and a bunch of notes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson said that joining the hall was ''the greatest honor'' he had ever received. ''Music is my life,'' he said. ''And what you're saying tonight is that my life has been well spent.''</p>
        <p>Backstage before the ceremony, Mr. Wilson said: ''I was so surprised when I heard about it I almost dropped dead. I thought it was the most brilliant idea to put me in the  Hall of Fame.''</p>
        <p>Before presenting an award to Mr. Brown, Sean Puffy Combs said that Mr. Brown's ''Ants in My Pants'' had been the first single he owned. ''I just danced to that all day and night,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown, looking back to his first hit, said '' 'Please, Please, Please' not only made me a big star but took the broom out of my hand  because I was a janitor.''</p>
        <p>Accepting his award, Mr. Taylor said: ''I don't know where songs come from. I hope they keep coming.'' He added that he considered music ''true to the laws of the universe'' and deeply spiritual. ''I thank God for music, and I thank music for God,'' he said.</p>
        <p>J. D. Souther, who collaborated with the Eagles on songs like ''Best of My Love,'' said that when Mr. Henley and Mr. Frey wrote songs, they ''stayed in a room and were ruthless with each other until they were finished.''</p>
        <p>A lifetime achievement award was given to Neil Diamond, and the hit maker award, for an interpreter, was given to Johnny Mathis. Julian Aberbach, who founded the country-music publishing company Hill and Range, received the annual publisher's award.</p>
        <p>The hall also recognized two songs: ''All of Me,'' by Gerald Marks and Seymour Simons, and ''You Are My Sunshine,'' by Jimmie Davis. Presenting the Towering Song award, Richie Sambora of Bon Jovi noted that Mr. Davis became governor of Louisiana. He added, ''O.K., Governor Pataki -- write us a song.''</p>
