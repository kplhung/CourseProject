        <p>Aetna Inc. indicated yesterday that negotiations to sell its financial services and international units to the ING Group, the Dutch financial services and insurance company, had hit a bump.</p>
        <p>Aetna said it had started talks with other possible buyers, which it did not identify, while continuing the negotiations with ING.</p>
        <p>Shares of Aetna fell $3.875, or 5.3 percent, to $69.50, on the New York Stock Exchange, reflecting, at least in part, disappointment among traders who had bet on an imminent sale of the units to ING for $8 billion to $9 billion.</p>
        <p>William H. Donaldson, the chairman and chief executive of Aetna, said the talks with ING, which were disclosed on May 31, were continuing. He said Aetna was evaluating ''numerous expressions of interest'' by companies that wanted to buy its non-health-care units.</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts said the announcement could mean that ING was not interested in buying all of Aetna's financial and international units. Some said ING probably did not want Aetna's Latin American health business, which had been a drag on earnings. Others speculated that tax issues for Aetna or ING, or both, had made it difficult to agree on a price.</p>
        <p>Todd Richter, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, said that if a buyer like ING did not take the whole package, selling the units piecemeal could be a long, complicated process. ''A bird in the hand is often worth two, three or five birds in the bush,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donaldson reiterated that there were no assurances that there would be a sale or of what the terms might be. When the talks with ING started two weeks ago, he said Aetna was still ready to split the company into health and nonhealth divisions and spin them off to shareholders as separate companies.</p>
        <p>But Arun Kumar, an investment-grade bond analyst at Chase Securities, said he was certain that the financial and international units would be sold. ''It's a matter of when, and not if, they will announce a definitive sale,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Fred Laberge, a spokesman for the company, declined to say what was holding up a deal with ING or how many interested buyers were talking with Aetna.</p>
        <p>Tim Clark, an insurance industry analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, said other big financial services companies that might be interested included Allianz A.G. of Germany, Fortis of Belgium and Aegon of the Netherlands. He said American companies like Citigroup and the American International Group were less likely to be interested.</p>
        <p>Shares of Aetna dropped into the $30's in February on news of lawsuits against the company and disappointing financial results. Under pressure from large investors, Richard L. Huber resigned as chief executive on Feb. 25 and was replaced by Mr. Donaldson, a board member and a co-founder of the Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette securities firm.</p>
        <p>After rebounding, the stock price slid back to the high $50's when the company rejected an offer in March from ING and WellPoint Health Networks, a California insurer that wanted to open discussions about paying $10 billion or so for all of Aetna's businesses.</p>
