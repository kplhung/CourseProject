        <p>During the too-brief peak of his creative powers, the Broadway lyricist Alan Jay Lerner displayed an unparalleled gift of grace. If his songwriting lacked a personal stamp as distinctive as Lorenz Hart's, Oscar Hammerstein's or Cole Porter's, he melded aspects of their voices (Hart's urbane wit, Hammerstein's formal grandeur and Porter's verbal  dexterity) into a flowery cosmopolitan diction that embodied a romantic 1950's ideal of aristocratic style.</p>
        <p>Probably no one else could have translated ''Pygmalion'' into a vernacular song style as seamlessly as Lerner did with his most important musical collaborator, Frederick Loewe, in ''My Fair Lady.'' Their crowning coup was to make it all look easy. Its songs -- even the exquisitely rhymed patter songs -- seemed to flow effortlessly. The same can't quite be said for the team's slightly more self-conscious scores for ''Gigi'' and ''Camelot.''</p>

        <p>During the too-brief peak of his creative powers, the Broadway lyricist Alan Jay Lerner displayed an unparalleled gift of grace. If his songwriting lacked a personal stamp as distinctive as Lorenz Hart's, Oscar Hammerstein's or Cole Porter's, he melded aspects of their voices (Hart's urbane wit, Hammerstein's formal grandeur and Porter's verbal  dexterity) into a flowery cosmopolitan diction that embodied a romantic 1950's ideal of aristocratic style.</p>
        <p>Probably no one else could have translated ''Pygmalion'' into a vernacular song style as seamlessly as Lerner did with his most important musical collaborator, Frederick Loewe, in ''My Fair Lady.'' Their crowning coup was to make it all look easy. Its songs -- even the exquisitely rhymed patter songs -- seemed to flow effortlessly. The same can't quite be said for the team's slightly more self-conscious scores for ''Gigi'' and ''Camelot.''</p>
        <p>Making it look easy, of course, was extremely difficult. For Lerner, who died in 1986, writing a song could be an excruciating process that lasted for weeks or longer until every verbal hole was plugged with the perfect word. And as the singer Mary Cleere  Haran pointed out on Wednesday in her astutely witty introduction to the first of two shows at Carnegie Hall celebrating Lerner's legacy, he battled more than his share of personal demons. Rex Harrison once joked that between the two of them, Harrison, who married six times and Lerner, who married eight, ''supported more women than Playtex.''</p>
        <p>The two shows, each featuring a different all-star cast, were divided into a cabaret and jazz evening on Wednesday (featuring a 13-piece band led by Mike Renzi) and a more formal Broadway evening on Thursday with a 30-piece theatrical orchestra conducted by Ben Whiteley.</p>
        <p>Multi-star concerts of this sort are typically uneven affairs in which a few scattered high spots redeem lulls. But the two Lerner tributes turned out to be more consistent than average. Except for some isolated miscalculations, the matings of singer and material were sensible. Even so, the hall's notorious sound system muddied the band's sound and hyperbolic offstage introductions of the performers lent the proceedings a cheap television-show ambience.</p>
        <p>High points of the first and more intimate program included Ms. Haran's truly far-sighted ''On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,'' which invested the song with a calm, prayerful spirituality, and the unabashedly romantic, almost tearful renditions by Christine Andreas (a former Eliza Doolittle) of songs from ''My Fair Lady'' and ''1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''</p>
        <p>Carol Sloane brought a smoky jazz intimacy to ''Too Late Now.'' The pianist Fred Hersch meditated intelligently on ''I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face'' and explored the angles of ''Get Me to the Church on Time'' in a subtle rhythmic deconstruction. Near the end, Elaine Stritch stopped the show with ''Why Him?'' done as gravel-voiced, deadpan, mock-hostile comic monologue.</p>
        <p>In the second program, which concentrated on meat-and-potatoes ballads, Robert Goulet emerged as the evening's monarch with a climactic digest of songs from ''Camelot.'' Mr. Goulet's career as a lounge singer may have left an oily imprint on his style, but the 66-year-old singer's baritone remains as commanding as ever. His was one of several heroically sized performances (Ron Raines, Brent Barrett, Benjamin Brecher and Julia Migenes nearly matched him) in an evening that emphasized semi-operatic numbers from ''Brigadoon.''</p>
        <p>The most glaring mismatch of singer and material was Jennifer Holliday's ''swing'' version of ''On the Street Where You Live.'' Ms. Holliday's mannerisms, especially her bizarre overemphasis on consonants, distorted the lyrics and rhythmically bent the song so out of shape that coordination between voice and orchestra became problematic.</p>
