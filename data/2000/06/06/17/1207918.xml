        <p>Shares of the struggling Trans World Airlines and AirTran Holdings Inc. rose yesterday on reports that they were holding merger discussions. But people close to the talks said there was little chance of a deal.</p>
        <p>'' If AirTran is going to buy T.W.A., it is going to need money,'' said an investment banker who has talked to both companies. ''I don't see how they are going to do that other than with junk bonds, and the junk bond market is very weak right now.''</p>

        <p>Shares of the struggling Trans World Airlines and AirTran Holdings Inc. rose yesterday on reports that they were holding merger discussions. But people close to the talks said there was little chance of a deal.</p>
        <p>'' If AirTran is going to buy T.W.A., it is going to need money,'' said an investment banker who has talked to both companies. ''I don't see how they are going to do that other than with junk bonds, and the junk bond market is very weak right now.''</p>
        <p>Once one of the country's leading airlines, T.W.A. has seen its fortunes decline in recent years as it sold its international routes and focused on its hub in St. Louis. The airline sought bankruptcy protection twice during the 1990's and it continues to lose money even as other airlines have been profiting from the booming economy.</p>
        <p>T.W.A. has been searching for a buyer for some time, according to industry insiders. But despite a young fleet of planes and operational improvements that have the airline leading the industry in on-time arrivals, there has been little interest from major carriers because T.W.A.'s financial and labor woes are seen as much bigger than the strategic value of its route network.</p>
        <p>T.W.A. would not say whether it was talking to AirTran. ''We have had and continue to have conversations with many airlines about possible business transactions,'' Mark Abels, T.W.A.'s spokesman, said yesterday. ''And we are always open to a transaction that makes sense for our employees and shareholders.''</p>
        <p>An AirTran spokesman also declined to confirm that talks were being held, as was reported yesterday by The Atlanta Journal and Constitution and The Wall Street Journal. But Leslie Head, vice president of AirTran, was quoted in The Journal and Constitution as saying that the talks were preliminary and that AirTran would be the acquirer if there was a deal.</p>
        <p>Investment bankers and analysts found that difficult to believe. AirTran had only $100 million in cash at the end of the first quarter. Last month, the Boeing Company agreed to slow its delivery of 717 jets to AirTran to give the carrier some financial breathing room.</p>
        <p>Shares of T.W.A. rose 31.25 cents, to $2.875, while AirTran shares jumped 25 cents, to $4.5625.</p>
