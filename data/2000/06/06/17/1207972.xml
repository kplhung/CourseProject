        <p>Rats were very much on the agenda this week, as well as on the menu.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday night's episode of ''Survivor,'' the CBS game show, contestants on the island of Pulau Tiga skinned, roasted and ate rats to stay in the running to win $1 million.</p>
        <p>Coincidentally, the next day, New York's labor unions paraded their favorite props -- giant inflatable rats, representing nonunion workers -- through Union Square.</p>
        <p>And yesterday, the most striking convergence of all occurred: At the exact moment that animal rights advocates were in front of a CBS office protesting the culinary choices on ''Survivor,'' public officials were discussing the growing rat menace on another island, Manhattan, and in the city's other boroughs, where by some accounts rats outnumber people 8 to 1.</p>
        <p>''They bite children,'' Councilman Bill Perkins said at a City Council hearing on rat eradication. ''They are dangerous. They carry diseases. They contaminate food. They are unsightly. We live in a culture where rats aren't friendly.''</p>
        <p>Nor are they usually for dinner.</p>
        <p>And they certainly should not be eaten for television entertainment, said members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, who protested outside a CBS office on 57th Street yesterday.</p>
        <p>''Just because they are not cute and snuggly, it doesn't mean they don't feel pain,'' said RaeLeann Smith, 27, a spokeswoman for the group who traveled from Norfolk, Va., to attend the demonstration.</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith and seven other demonstrators -- including one in a furry rat costume -- stood outside the office for two hours yesterday morning, pumping their fists and chanting: ''Don't kill animals. Rats have rights. Survive on veggies. Rats have rights.''</p>
        <p>Chris Ender, a CBS spokesman, said the network respected the protesters' views, but added, ''We truly believe our viewers recognize that hunting and fishing for the purpose of sustenance has been acceptable since the dawn of time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ender said the contestants on the show were instructed not to harm monkeys, lizards or other creatures indigenous to Pulau Tiga, a deserted Pacific island.</p>
        <p>But rats are not indigenous, he said, having arrived on the island aboard ships.</p>
        <p>At the City Council hearing, where officials talked quite a bit about getting rid of rats, the subject of eating them did not come up.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Perkins declined to step into the ''Survivor'' controversy. ''They can do whatever they want with rats on that island,'' he said after the hearing. ''But for us, in a civilized society, we don't need rats.''</p>
