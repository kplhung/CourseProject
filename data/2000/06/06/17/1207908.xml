        <p>Jules Feiffer's moody modern dancer, the comic strip figure who has leaped and stretched interpretively to spring, summer, autumn and winter for over 40 years, is finally hanging up her tights. The reason? Her only venue, ''Feiffer,'' Mr. Feiffer's doodly comic strip of personal, sexual and political rants, is ending tomorrow.</p>
        <p>''The 52-week-per-year schedule was relentless,'' Mr. Feiffer said, speaking of his comic strip, which has run every Sunday in The Los Angeles Times, The Miami Herald, The Chicago Tribune and The Observer in London. ''I'm getting to be an old man,'' he said. So ''the dancer is retired.''</p>

        <p>Jules Feiffer's moody modern dancer, the comic strip figure who has leaped and stretched interpretively to spring, summer, autumn and winter for over 40 years, is finally hanging up her tights. The reason? Her only venue, ''Feiffer,'' Mr. Feiffer's doodly comic strip of personal, sexual and political rants, is ending tomorrow.</p>
        <p>''The 52-week-per-year schedule was relentless,'' Mr. Feiffer said, speaking of his comic strip, which has run every Sunday in The Los Angeles Times, The Miami Herald, The Chicago Tribune and The Observer in London. ''I'm getting to be an old man,'' he said. So ''the dancer is retired.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Feiffer started drawing his strip in 1956 for The Village Voice. It was about the ''usual boy-girl stuff,'' as he described it. The dancer made her first appearance in 1957 with ''a dance to spring.'' Then she began doing interpretive pieces to the rest of the seasons. In spring her dance was stretchy, hopeful and giddy. In summer it was ''lazy, so lazy'' and ultimately wilted in the heat. In the autumn she danced wistfully to the leaves falling. She and the strip were syndicated in 1959.</p>
        <p>The dancer, given to leaps of ecstasy, ranting and silliness, was modeled after ''the first girl who slept with me and spent the night,'' Mr. Feiffer said. She was a dancer attending Brooklyn College. He thinks she has died.</p>
        <p>''The early dancer looked just like her,'' he said, ''and as I changed girlfriends, her body changed.'' As far as Mr. Feiffer can remember, the dancer was never modeled on his wife, Jenny, but she did come to represent Mr. Feiffer himself. ''At a certain point, the girl became me and I became her. She was there to talk about how lousy her life was. That I will miss. It is not the cartoon I got tired of, it is the weekly schedule.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Feiffer, who is 71, writes plays, teaches a course on humor and truth at Southampton College of Long Island University, writes and illustrates children's books and still draws political cartoons for The New York Times, The New Yorker, American Prospect and Rolling Stone. It is very hard work trying to make Al Gore and George W. Bush funny all the time, he noted. ''Something had to give.''</p>
        <p>Three of his farewell comic strips have already run, and the last will appear tomorrow. ''I decided to give up the strip two or three months ago,'' he said. ''I was just going to drop it without saying anything. But there are readers who are going to be disappointed.'' So Mr. Feiffer devoted the last few strips to explaining to the dancer why she is now out of a job.</p>
        <p>He tells her that he is giving up the strip. The dancer gasps, ''You're dying.'' But as she finds out that he is quitting merely to devote more time to his life beyond his weekly six panels, she starts berating him. She calls him pathetic and asks whether he is abandoning the strip because it has become boring or ''because no one of your generation knows you're around anymore and young people have never heard of you?'' Mr. Feiffer is unfazed. ''It's my turn to dance,'' he says, shoving her out of the way.</p>
