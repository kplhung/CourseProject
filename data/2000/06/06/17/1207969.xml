        <p>Vice President Al Gore moved quickly today to try to tamp down unrest among labor leaders over his appointment of Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, a chief labor nemesis during the recent fight over the China trade bill, as chairman of his presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore told reporters that the first person outside of his campaign circle whom he called with the news on Thursday was John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sweeney said in an interview today that he was traveling on Thursday morning and that he and Mr. Gore did not actually speak until afternoon, long after he had learned of Mr. Daley's appointment through news reports.</p>
        <p>Others said Mr. Sweeney, one of the vice president's most consistent allies, had been left fuming because he was not alerted in advance. Mr. Sweeney issued a statement saying Mr. Daley's advocacy of the China trade bill and the North American Free Trade Agreement put him ''squarely on the opposite side of working families.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sweeney then accepted an urgent invitation by the vice president to meet with him today. And so Mr. Sweeney and Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and chairman of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political arm, trooped to Mr. Gore's official residence here this afternoon and stayed for an hour to  discuss the Daley appointment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley was not present.</p>
        <p>''That comes later,'' Mr. Sweeney said. ''Before we talk to the appointee, we talk to the one making the appointments.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sweeney described the session as frank and blunt. ''I expressed concern about what effect this might have on our rank and file,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said the selection of Mr. Daley  was especially disappointing because it came so soon after the bitterly divisive House vote last month to normalize trade relations with the Chinese. Mr. Daley was the point man for the Clinton administration in advancing the bill over labor's fierce objections.</p>
        <p>''What we said yesterday still stands,'' Mr. Sweeney said. ''Bill Daley, in his new position, will need to prove he can fight just as hard for America's working families as he fought for America's trade deals.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sweeney said Mr. Gore had reflected on ''how unfortunate it was that this all developed, that the timing was difficult and it happened very quickly.''</p>
        <p>''He recognized that the communication was not as good as it could have been,'' Mr. Sweeney said.</p>
        <p>It is not clear whether Mr. Gore made any promises to the labor leaders to make up for this appointment, although Mr. Sweeney said he expected Mr. Gore to continue advancing his agenda for working families and would perhaps ''accelerate'' it.</p>
        <p>Despite the discomfort of his flock, particularly in the industrial unions, Mr. Sweeney has remained a staunch Gore supporter. And he reflects the view of many in labor that the unions will ultimately be able to overlook the vice president's pro-trade activity because they are determined to keep the White House in Democratic hands.</p>
        <p>Aides of Mr. Gore said he believed that Mr. Daley would be a clear asset to the campaign, despite his having crossed swords with labor.</p>
        <p>The vice president ''has tremendous confidence in Secretary Daley, and they had talked about this job before,'' a Gore confidant said, adding: ''It would be a mistake to take today as a snapshot of where we will be in November. It's an issue that will be worked through, but in the end the interests of labor and the Democratic Party are so consistent with one another that everyone will be working toward the same goal.''</p>
        <p>But the notion that labor has nowhere else to go in the presidential election infuriates others. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which called the Daley appointment a ''slap in the face,'' and the United Automobile Workers have both declined to endorse Mr. Gore and are toying with endorsing Ralph Nader or Patrick J. Buchanan instead. And the United Steelworkers of America, which has endorsed Mr. Gore, remains detached from his campaign.</p>
        <p>''We're in the assessment mode on the politics,'' said Gary Hubbard, a spokesman for the steelworkers. ''We've had a lot of members bailing out from the Democratic Party.''</p>
