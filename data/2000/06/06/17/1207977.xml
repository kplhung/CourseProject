        <p>The Xerox Corporation, besieged by strong competition in its highest-margin product lines, problems collecting on accounts in Mexico and upheaval in its sales force, warned investors yesterday that its second-quarter earnings would be as much as 12 cents below analysts' expectations of 42 cents a share.</p>
        <p>Xerox issued similar warnings in  the third and fourth quarters of last year.

        <p>The Xerox Corporation, besieged by strong competition in its highest-margin product lines, problems collecting on accounts in Mexico and upheaval in its sales force, warned investors yesterday that its second-quarter earnings would be as much as 12 cents below analysts' expectations of 42 cents a share.</p>
        <p>Xerox issued similar warnings in  the third and fourth quarters of last year. Investors who had hoped the bad news was over when the company met expectations last quarter demonstrated their disappointment swiftly and harshly. They drove shares of Xerox down 18 percent, to close at $20.75, a drop of $4.5625.</p>
        <p>Last month, Xerox ousted its chief executive, G. Richard Thoman, and returned its former chief, Paul Allaire, to the top spot. Anne M. Mulcahy, 47, head of the company's general markets organization, became  president and is seen as the likely heir apparent. Analysts doubt, however, that the new team has a quick fix for Xerox's problems.</p>
        <p>''Paul and Anne found more under the rock than they expected,'' said David A. Nadler, a consultant to Xerox. ''They have tremendous credibility with employees and customers, but they still have to earn credibility on Wall Street.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, although Xerox did not comment on future earnings, analysts flooded First Call/Thomson Financial with lowered earnings estimates for this year and next. ''No one thinks this is just a one-quarter problem,'' said Charles L. Hill, director of research at First Call.</p>
        <p>Many of Xerox's problems stem from last year's reorganization of the sales force in which the company made sales representatives responsible for specific industries, not geographic territories. Xerox also consolidated its customer administration offices, resulting in numerous customer service problems. Thus, the sales representatives had to cope with new clients even as they fielded irate calls from old ones.</p>
        <p>''Clients tell us it can take Xerox salesmen a week to return calls,'' said James W. Lundy, a director at the Gartner research firm. ''Xerox has to learn how to compete again.''</p>
        <p>Xerox management did not try to sugarcoat the company's responsibility for its current woes. ''Most of our difficulties are of our own making,'' Mr. Allaire told analysts in a conference call. ''The issues that led us to this point are largely the issues we've talked about previously.''</p>
        <p>It is exactly that all-too-familiar ring that worries many analysts. ''You could have listened to that conference call, and said it's June 16, 1999, not 2000,'' said Jack L. Kelly, a Goldman, Sachs analyst.  ''The longer this turnaround takes, the higher the probability that the problem is strategy, not execution.''</p>
        <p>Others worry that even one-time earnings disappointments may point to deeper problems. Take, for example, Xerox's warning that unexpected problems with customer receivables in Mexico could pare more than 5 cents a share off the quarter's earnings.</p>
        <p>Gibboney Huske, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, said, ''I'm less concerned that this will be a recurring item than I am about the company's financial controls.''</p>
        <p>Xerox said the worries were misplaced. ''Our internal investigation  spotted the problem,'' said Christa Carone, a Xerox spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Competitors, meanwhile, like Heidelberger Druckmaschinen A.G. of Germany, Canon Inc. of Japan, and most recently, I.B.M. -- with a high-speed copier that uses a Heidelberger engine -- are making deep inroads into the market for superhigh-speed copiers, Xerox's most profitable product line.</p>
        <p>Still, the Xerox picture is not all bleak. The flood of experienced sales representatives out of the company has slowed to a trickle. Sales of color copiers have been brisk. Many analysts have applauded the company's joint venture with Microsoft to sell software, and its recent distribution deal with Dell Computer.</p>
        <p>Xerox will soon introduce some new high-priced office copiers and a line of low-priced printers. Analysts say Xerox also is negotiating a deal to bundle Xerox inkjet printers with a large computer company's personal computers.</p>
        <p>''The turnaround will take longer than we thought, but the long term picture is bright,'' Mr. Huske said.</p>
