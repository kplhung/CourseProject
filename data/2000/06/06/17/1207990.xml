        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I have witnessed Arthur Levine's observation regarding the segregated conditions at institutions of higher education (Op-Ed, June 11). Paradoxically, this is happening as increasingly diverse populations enter.</p>
        <p>Just last September, while I was instructing a class, one student felt ''safe'' enough to describe how she was a target for failure. I asked her what she meant by that. She replied, ''I know that you want to fail me . . . everybody here wants me to fail.'' Amazed by her comments and her honesty, I asked where she had come to know this. ''My advisers (a unit in the university for economically disadvantaged students) told me.''</p>

        <p>This experience is unique only because it became part of a public conversation. Privately, enclaves of culture are at war with one another.</p>
