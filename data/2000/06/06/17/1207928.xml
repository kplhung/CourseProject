        <p>Next year's Breeders' Cup, racing's richest day with eight championship races and $13 million in purses, was awarded yesterday to Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>The 18th running of the races will be held at Belmont on Oct. 27, 2001. It will be the fourth year that a New York track has been the host. Aqueduct was the host in 1985, and Belmont in 1990 and in 1995. The 1995 Breeders' Cup was marked by a memorable performance by Cigar, who won the Breeders' Cup Classic en route to being named Horse of the Year.</p>

        <p>Next year's Breeders' Cup, racing's richest day with eight championship races and $13 million in purses, was awarded yesterday to Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>The 18th running of the races will be held at Belmont on Oct. 27, 2001. It will be the fourth year that a New York track has been the host. Aqueduct was the host in 1985, and Belmont in 1990 and in 1995. The 1995 Breeders' Cup was marked by a memorable performance by Cigar, who won the Breeders' Cup Classic en route to being named Horse of the Year.</p>
        <p>The races are moved each year to a different part of the country. Last year's Breeders' Cup was at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Fla. This year's will be on Nov. 4 at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky.</p>
        <p>D. G. Van Clief Jr., president of Breeders' Cup Ltd., said Santa Anita in California was the site favored for 2002. Santa Anita had been considered for this year's races but it declined because of construction at the racetrack.</p>
        <p>Belmont Park, situated in Elmont on Long Island, on the edge of Queens and Nassau counties, is in its 96th year. Before this year's Belmont Stakes was run last Saturday, the track had been the home to three consecutive Belmont Stakes races when the Triple Crown went on the line before crowds that ranged from 70,000 to 85,000. Each time, in dramatic finishes, the Triple Crown was denied.</p>
