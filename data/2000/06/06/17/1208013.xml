        <p>Correction of May 14 article about executions in Texas; federal judge ruled in 1998 that pardons board barely met minimal procedural safeguards under Constitution; other facts also amended (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on May 14 about executions in Texas during the tenure of Gov. George W. Bush misstated the year in which a federal judge in Austin ruled that the Texas pardons and paroles board barely met minimal procedural safeguards required by the United States Constitution. It was 1998, not 1988.</p>
        <p>A related article that day, about five cases that resulted in executions, referred incorrectly to the trial lawyer for James Lee Beathard, who was executed in 1999. The lawyer was retained, not appointed.</p>
        <p>The article included an erroneous tally from the parole board for its vote in the case of Troy Farris, who was also executed in 1999. Five members, not seven, voted for clemency.</p>
