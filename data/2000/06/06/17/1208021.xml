        <p>David Cone pitched three hitless innings last Sunday against the Mets, a burst of hope in an otherwise dismal season, until the rains washed away his effort and a deluge of distraction followed.</p>
        <p>Sammy Sosa trade rumors ballooned; Roger Clemens went on the disabled list; and then Chuck Knoblauch made one wild throw too many Thursday night and ducked out of the ballpark before the Yankees stumbled, 12-3, to the best team in the American League.</p>
        <p>Cone was pleased to be sitting outside the recent maelstrom, considering his last and only victory in 13 starts this season was on April 28.</p>
        <p>''It did take a little heat off me,'' he said last night, ''but it didn't lessen the burden.''</p>
        <p>On a muggy evening billed for redemption at Yankee Stadium, when Knoblauch returned to second base amid thundering cheers of sympathy, Cone threw off the burden he created for himself. He showed that last Sunday was no fluke by giving up one run in six innings, striking out five and pitching with control, location and confidence.</p>
        <p>All that he lacked was the victory and run support. Manager Joe Torre called for left-hander Mike Stanton to relieve Cone for the seventh inning, and Stanton gave up the winning run that led to the Yankees' 3-1 loss, their second straight to the White Sox.</p>
        <p>''I really wanted to win that game, 1-0, because I thought that was what it would take,'' Cone said. ''I feel good about it, don't get me wrong. But I've got a ways to go to redeem myself.'</p>
        <p>While Cone's record remains locked at 1-6, the Chicago ace James Baldwin recorded his 10th victory of the season. Even though the Yankees had been the only team to blemish his record back on May 26, Baldwin befuddled their hitters all night, striking out five in seven and a third innings.</p>
        <p>''I'm frustrated when we don't win,'' Torre said. ''We're too good of a team, with too good of pitching to be floundering the way we've been floundering.''</p>
        <p>Until last night, Cone had been the one gasping as he had given up 16 earned runs in his last 16 1/3 innings and had carried a 6.49 earned run average into this game. But there was something different about him on the mound against Chicago, something that he first showed six days ago.</p>
        <p>''After the rainout, I felt like I knew what I was doing again,'' Cone said, a realization that came after changing his arm angle slightly, when working with Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach.</p>
        <p>For the second straight start, Cone began with the backup catcher Chris Turner behind the plate, and their rhythm together showed. Cone began last night's game exactly where he left off last Sunday: pitching three hitless innings and retiring the first 10 batters.</p>
        <p>In the top of the fourth, third baseman Scott Brosius got to Baldwin first, by blasting the first-pitch for a home run to left-center field.</p>
        <p>Cone struck out a batter in each of his first five innings. It was not until the sixth inning when he got into trouble, however. Catcher Mark Johnson led off the inning with to single to right. Cone, who had given up 14 walks in his last four starts, allowed his first walk of the game to Ray Durham on four straight pitches. Shortstop Jose Valentin came to the plate and even though Cone jumped ahead in the count, 0-2, Valentin layed down a perfect bunt on the third base line.</p>
        <p>But after Frank Thomas lined out to Scott Brosius -- ''I felt like I caught a break,'' Cone said -- Magglio Ordonez flied out to left, deep enough to tie the score at 1-1.</p>
        <p>''I was trying to be aggressive, throwing him a slider,'' Cone said.</p>
        <p>Paul Konerko grounded back to Cone to end the inning.</p>
        <p>When Stanton came up for the seventh, Cone was surprised. He had only thrown 88 pitches, 60 for strikes.  ''I wasn't happy about it, but when you're 1-6 you can't argue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Torre wanted to bring Stanton in because he would be facing left-handed hitters stocked in the middle to bottom of the lineup. That gamble failed when Chicago's Chris Singleton led off the top of the seventh inning with a triple deep to right field that was almost a home run. While Paul O'Neill snagged it a foot above the wall, he could not bring it down with him, and Singleton held up on third base. Two outs and three batters later, the pinch-hitter Tony Graffanino grounded out to Derek Jeter, bringing Singleton home.</p>
        <p>Chicago added an insurance run off Mariano Rivera in the top of the ninth, when the closer allowed a double to Graffanino and Mark Johnson singled him home. It was Rivera's second appearance since June 4.</p>
        <p>New York had a good scoring opportunity in the eighth inning, when Baldwin had departed the game after seven and a third. The reliever Bobby Howry faced O'Neill, with Derek Jeter on base with a walk. O'Neill flied to right.</p>
        <p>With two outs, and Jeter having stolen second, Bernie Williams drew a full count, but was caught looking at an outside fastball belt high.</p>
        <p>Chicago came into the game tied with Atlanta for the best record in the majors. After the loss, Boston took the lead in the East by half a game.</p>
        <p>''We lost,'' Cone said. ''Don't get me wrong, I do feel good about it. I'm much better off than I was. I spotted the fastball well.''</p>
        <p>The rookie Jake Jake Westbrook was recalled from Class AAA Columbus, where he had a 5-6 record and a 4.92 E.R.A. in 12 games, and will start this afternoon's game.</p>
        <p>''The White Sox are playing well, we needed that tonight; now we got a rookie pitcher going tomorrow,'' Cone said. ''It's a big swing game in the series and they've got to feel good about it.''</p>
