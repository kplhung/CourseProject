        <p>The Senate campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton began broadcasting two 15-second television commercials yesterday, focused on health care and hate crimes legislation.</p>
        <p>PRODUCERS -- Devito/Verdi, with Mandy Grunwald, the Washington media consultant, and Mark Penn, the Washington pollster.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The formats of the advertisements are identical. A stark white stream of type moves rapidly across a black background. The impression is that of a news Teletype machine predating computers, and is heightened by the sound of typewriter keys being struck in rapid succession in the background.</p>
        <p>A male narrator, speaking somewhat breathlessly, reads the script as it passes. The stark black-and-white quality of the ad is softened only slightly by a small color image of a smiling Mrs. Clinton that appears at the end in the bottom right corner.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT ON HEALTH CARE -- ''News Update.  The Senate just voted to kill the Patients' Bill of Rights. By two votes. Hillary supports it. In the House, Rick Lazio voted against the bill, siding with the Republican leadership. Rick Lazio . . . the more you know . . .the more you wonder.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT ON HATE CRIMES LEGISLATION -- ''The state Senate just passed tougher penalties for hate crimes. Hillary fought for the bill. Rick Lazio was opposed. But five days after it passed, he flip-flopped. The Post called it an 'about face.' Rick Lazio . . . the more you know . . . the more you wonder.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The ad about health care focuses on a highly partisan dispute in Congress. It refers to the narrow Senate defeat on June 8 of a Democratic bill that would have enabled patients to sue their health maintenance organizations, which had earlier been opposed by Mr. Lazio in the House. But Mr. Lazio has supported Republican versions of managed care legislation, including one that would have allowed provide new tax deductions to help people pay medical bills.</p>
        <p>The ad about hate crimes legislation, which was approved by the New York State Senate on June 8 and is being negotiated by members of the Assembly, is correct in saying that Mr. Lazio first opposed the measure, then somewhat reluctantly endorsed it as a compromise.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The two short TV spots are the first produced by Mrs. Clinton's team that resemble attack advertising. Without the first lady's voice being heard, and her still photograph all but overwhelmed by the hard-edged script scrolling across the screen, the new ads provide a sharp contrast to her previous advertisements. Those ads evoked warmth and calm judgment as Mrs. Clinton or the narrator spoke of her record and aspirations, instead of attempting to point out missteps by her opponent.</p>
        <p>The new ads seem intended to call voter attention to narrowly drawn issues instead of to Mrs. Clinton's personality. Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, responded angrily yesterday, saying, ''New Yorkers deserve better than this and they are going to reject the politics of mudslinging Mrs. Clinton has begun.''</p>
        <p>THOMAS J. LUECK</p>
        <p>THE AD CAMPAIGN  Correction:  June 20, 2000, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about Representative Rick A. Lazio's remarks defending his profitable investments in a company controlled by contributors to his campaigns misstated the time period in which he collected the contributions. Mr. Lazio has raised $35,000 from executives of the company, Quick &amp; Reilly, since 1995, not 1965.</p>
