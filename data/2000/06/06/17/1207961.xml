        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton released her first television advertisements attacking an opponent by name yesterday, assailing Representative Rick A. Lazio for his opposition to legislation on hate crimes and health care as she intensified her effort to sow doubts about her new opponent among New Yorkers who know little about him.</p>
        <p>''The more you know, the more you wonder,'' the announcer says ominously at the conclusion of each of the two stark 15-second advertisements.</p>
        <p>The unusually short advertisements, each presented as a ''News Update,'' are a staccato presentation of white type on a black screen that mimic the clatter of type on old Teletype machine.</p>
        <p>They describe Mr. Lazio's position on two issues as out of step with political thinking in New York: regulation of health maintenance organizations, and legislation that provides additional penalties for crimes in which victims were chosen in part because of their race, gender or sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>The advertisements are the latest evidence of the extent to which Mrs. Clinton is trying to discredit Mr. Lazio, who became her opponent after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani stepped aside for health reasons.</p>
        <p>Over the past month, Mr. Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican, has sought to present himself as a moderate Republican, to the evident concern of Mrs. Clinton's advisers. The television advertisements come at the end of a week in which Mrs. Clinton has begun attacking Mr. Lazio for his votes in Congress.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has now become the first candidate in the Senate race to use negative television advertisements, an event that several politicians described as an early watershed in the rapid escalation of this race.</p>
        <p>Typically, candidates for office refrain from running negative advertisements until relatively late in the campaign, instead using their advertising budgets to present their views and background to voters.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's advisers said that her campaign had made the move now as part of an aggressive attempt to help voters form opinions of Mr. Lazio. This is the first in what is likely to be a series of such advertisements. ''This is going to be a race of clear contrasts, and voters deserve to know where the candidates stand on the critical issues,'' said Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, asserted that in both advertisements Mrs. Clinton distorted Mr. Lazio's record in an attempt to discredit him. He described the ads as ''a desperate act by a desperate campaign.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''History teaches us that the first victim of a Clinton campaign is the truth, and that is apparently the case in this race as well.''</p>
        <p>The first of the two advertisements focuses on Mr. Lazio's opposition to a Democratic version of a so-called patients' bill of rights. Among other things, it provides patients with the right to sue health maintenance organizations for mistreatment. Mr. Lazio supported a Republican bill that instead focuses on giving tax deductions to help people pay their medical premiums.</p>
        <p>The second advertisement focuses on Mr. Lazio's initial opposition to a hate crimes bill passed by the State Senate in Albany. Mr. Lazio's spokesman, Dan McLagan, said that the candidate opposed it because he believe that additional penalties should not be built into the statute, but should instead be addressed by judges during sentencing. He said Mr. Lazio later decided to support the legislation because ''something is better than nothing.''</p>
