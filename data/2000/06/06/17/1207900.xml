        <p>Craig Bierko had a good life in Los Angeles. He had been working steadily as an actor for the last decade. He had a nice house in Hancock Park and cruised the freeways in his Jeep. Boyishly handsome, 6 foot 4, with thick hair and green eyes, Mr. Bierko was socially in demand and found the hardest part of working on a set was the waiting around.</p>
        <p>But something was missing. Perhaps it was that he was doing guest appearances on popular television shows like ''Ally McBeal'' and ''Mad About You'' without landing a star vehicle of his own. But Mr. Bierko says it was something deeper than that: at 35 -- corny as it may sound -- he wanted to do more than coast through the rest of his career.</p>

        <p>Craig Bierko had a good life in Los Angeles. He had been working steadily as an actor for the last decade. He had a nice house in Hancock Park and cruised the freeways in his Jeep. Boyishly handsome, 6 foot 4, with thick hair and green eyes, Mr. Bierko was socially in demand and found the hardest part of working on a set was the waiting around.</p>
        <p>But something was missing. Perhaps it was that he was doing guest appearances on popular television shows like ''Ally McBeal'' and ''Mad About You'' without landing a star vehicle of his own. But Mr. Bierko says it was something deeper than that: at 35 -- corny as it may sound -- he wanted to do more than coast through the rest of his career.</p>
        <p>So he raised his hand for the role of Harold Hill in the Broadway revival of Meredith Willson's ''Music Man.'' And somewhat incredibly he won the part, even though the producers originally wanted a more bankable star like Steve Martin, Matthew Broderick or Alec Baldwin.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Bierko is performing night after night on Broadway and has won a Tony nomination (losing to Brian Stokes Mitchell of ''Kiss Me, Kate''). Though critics have said that he reminds them of Robert Preston, who originated the role in 1957 -- indeed there are times when Mr. Bierko seems to be eerily channeling the voice of his predecessor, it is so similar -- the critics agree that he has brought his own winning charm to the role of the slick but disarming traveling salesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bierko ''steps into Preston's long shadow with remarkable assurance,'' Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times. ''At times he seems to be patterning his gestures and inflections too closely on his famous predecessor. But he has a gleaming impishness of his own.''</p>
        <p>Inexperience notwithstanding, Mr. Bierko has also apparently won over his fellow cast members.</p>
        <p>''All the ladies love Craig,'' said Susan Stroman, director and choreographer of the revival. He has also passed muster with stage veterans like his co-star Rebecca Luker, who has been on Broadway four times before.</p>
        <p>''He's so consistent,'' she said. ''He's right there with me every night.''</p>
        <p>Before he could attempt this role, Mr. Bierko said, he got to the point where he believed he could survive falling on his face. He has not read his reviews, he said, so he does not wholly realize just how fine things turned out.</p>
        <p>He said the experience had proved to be precisely the ''something more'' he had been craving. He is working harder than ever before. He has no social life. And he has never been happier.</p>
        <p>''I didn't realize how thirsty I was for a life like this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, the adjustment has been profound. ''I wasn't psychologically prepared for what it means to do previews at the same time that you're rehearsing eight hours a day, then promote the show after you open,'' he said. ''I didn't know what it meant to buckle down and really learn to dance. It's an entirely new world of discipline for me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bierko said the process of mastering this role had had a maturing effect on him. ''I finally felt like I was older than 18 for some reason,'' he said. ''Grown-upness kicked in. I now have to clean up. Up until now it was adorable to keep dishes in the sink.''</p>
        <p>Though he had not performed onstage since he appeared in a revival of ''The Boys From Syracuse'' in Los Angeles in 1989, Mr. Bierko said he was not nervous about being on Broadway for the first time. He credited this calm to Ms. Stroman, who he said taught him his huge part one small bit at a time and made rehearsals feel safe.</p>
        <p>''Rather than creating a relationship where I was constantly trying to prove something to her, where I felt like I was still auditioning even after I had the role, she would light a fire,'' he said. ''She inspired me. I wanted to come in and learn all this stuff.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stroman said her leading man came in with no Hollywood attitude, that he was ready to make a fool of himself if necessary.</p>
        <p>''He has a fearless personality,'' she said. ''He was very willing to learn how to twirl the baton, though the first day, he clipped his eye and was bleeding.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bierko was not entirely new to the stage; he grew up around it because his parents ran the Harrison Players community theater near Rye Brook, N.Y., their hometown. As a boy he helped out with menial chores there. His mother, who worked for Dolce International, a hotel and conference center company, and his father, a traveling salesman, divorced when he was 10.</p>
        <p>At Northwestern University he studied theater, appearing in plays like ''The Threepenny Opera'' and ''Twelfth Night.'' But he also studied film and television, and when he graduated, the glamour and sprawl of Los Angeles beckoned.</p>
        <p>''I'm a weird freak who actually likes to drive, so it's a perfect city for me,'' he said. ''It was a lifestyle choice.''</p>
        <p>His film roles have ranged from the villain in ''The Long Kiss Goodnight'' to a comedic turn in ''Sour Grapes'' and a part in the virtual-reality thriller ''The 13th Floor.''</p>
        <p>''I like the things that I've done, I like the choices I've made,'' Mr. Bierko said. ''But suddenly I developed a hunger to learn other things. I felt I was beginning to fall into a groove in L.A.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stroman said: ''He studied in school but went west instead of east. Thank goodness he's finally come east because we need him here on Broadway. We don't have leading men like Craig Bierko.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bierko said he had grown up loving the 1962 movie version of ''The Music Man'' and Mr. Preston's performance in it, but that he was doing his own version of the role.</p>
        <p>''I think he kind of haunts this performance a little bit,'' he said. ''But I didn't purposely try to recreate his performance. Rather than try to copy him or go out of my way to disregard everything he did, I was just going to try to honor his performance.''</p>
        <p>As much as hard work has sobered and intensified his outlook, Mr. Bierko said, perhaps the most lasting impact of his ''Music Man'' experience has been watching firsthand how Ms. Stroman created a work of such buoyancy even as she was weathering the loss of her husband, the director Mike Ockrent, to cancer in December.</p>
        <p>''The way she navigates her way through her life right now and pulls so much beauty from the darkness: it's been an amazing lesson in keeping things in perspective and trying to achieve some kind of balance,'' Mr. Bierko said. ''She's dealing with the unspeakable grief of losing the love of her life and finding solace in the work. What that is teaching me nothing can take away.''</p>
        <p>''It saves her, her work saves her,'' he continued. ''And it's not an escape. It's a true healing experience. Some people are workaholics, and some dive into work with their souls and heal themselves. And that's what I've watched her do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bierko said he believed that Ms. Stroman's loss had added a darker side to the show than it had before, and that the searching quality of both Harold Hill and Marian the librarian, who ultimately find companionship in each other, is more pronounced in this production.</p>
        <p>''I think there is something in what Susan is going through right now that is very attached to that sense of loneliness,'' he said. ''She's living it every minute. It's the perfect example of grabbing something joyful out of something horrendous.</p>
        <p>''That's a long journey from trying to get a sitcom deal together. I feel like I've beheld something majestic.''</p>
