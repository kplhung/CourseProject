        <p>Confirming afterward that this was his last United States Open, Jack Nicklaus was rewarded with an emotional send-off.</p>
        <p>After Nicklaus teed off on the 18th hole, he was showered with applause throughout his memorable walk, with the noise rising as he reached the green.</p>
        <p>Nicklaus gave the gallery one more sensational shot, reaching the green of the par-5, 543-yard final hole with a terrific 3-wood from 263 yards that stopped on the green, about 50 feet short of the hole.</p>
        <p>As Nicklaus took off his hat and walked toward the green, the gallery shook with noise, and he dabbed tears from his eyes. An eagle was not meant to be, as Nicklaus left the 50-footer six feet short, then watched as his second putt hung on the lip, forcing him to settle for par.</p>
        <p>As he left the green, Nicklaus hugged his wife, Barbara, signed his scorecard (73-82, 13 over par), and sounded rather definitive that he would never play another Open.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure that this is going to be my last Open,'' said Nicklaus, who at age 60 was playing his 44th consecutive Open. ''I can't imagine that this won't be my last. I guess if I won the Senior Open I could play, but I'm not sure even then I would.</p>
        <p>''I can't imagine the U.S.G.A. would give me another exemption,'' said Nicklaus, referring to the United States Golf Association.</p>
        <p>''They've been very kind to me. I think they wanted to get me through the year 2000. I was hoping to make the cut.''</p>
        <p>Asked about reaching the 18th green in two shots, Nicklaus said: ''Why not? I knew it was going to be my last round.''</p>
        <p>The entire week was emotional for Nicklaus. He backed away from his first tee shot Thursday and paused for a moment in honor of Payne Stewart, last year's champion who was killed in an October plane crash. Nicklaus was slotted in the starting position that is usually reserved for the defending champion.</p>
        <p>''I went to the starter, Ron Reed, and said, 'Ron, would you object to a moment of silence before I hit in honor of Payne?' '' Nicklaus said. ''He said, 'No, that's very appropriate.' So that's what I did.''</p>
        <p>Irwin Still Has Game</p>
        <p>Hale Irwin, a dominant player on the Senior Tour, showed he can still compete with the younger set at age 55, shooting an opening-round 68. Although he faded today with a 78, Irwin was four over par for the tournament and would most likely survive the weekend cut.</p>
        <p>Irwin was one of the many players who had an early wake-up call this morning to complete first-round play.</p>
        <p>''I don't see four o'clock very often,'' he said. ''I'm on the Senior Tour. We have those nice, relaxed starting times.''</p>
        <p>Coston Makes Up for Lost Time</p>
        <p>Jeff Coston, who had not played in the Open since 1978, also looked as if he would make the cut, ending his second round at five over par over all. ''Somebody touch me and wake me up,'' said Coston, who is 55 and from Seattle. ''I would like to see how I respond tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Asked the difference between playing the Open today compared with 22 years ago, Coston said: ''I don't see the ball as well. I went to get that laser surgery and he said it was too late for me.''</p>
