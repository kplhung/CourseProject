        <p>Many men who run huge enterprises and reach the summit of their professions want their sons to follow in their footsteps. But on this Father's Day, two sons who tried to follow their fathers' career paths have instead followed them into prison.</p>
        <p>In both cases, it was a family business. The fathers are John J. Gotti, the convicted boss of the Gambino crime family, and Carmine J. Persico, the imprisoned leader of the Colombo family.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gotti, 59, and Mr. Persico, 66, have been accused by prosecutors of being the heads of two of the nation's largest and deadliest Mafia families. They are serving life sentences on charges of murder and racketeering. Their sons, John A. Gotti, 36, and Alphonse T. Persico, 46, are also behind prison walls, mainly as a consequence of inheriting their fathers' criminal empires, organized crime experts assert.</p>
        <p>When the elder Mr. Gotti and the elder Mr. Persico anointed their sons as their successors, they defied long-standing Mafia orthodoxy, according to law enforcement officials and mob historians. These experts note that although mobsters can recruit close relatives, under Mafia tradition a boss cannot unilaterally designate a successor. No previous American Mafia boss, the experts said, had crowned a son.</p>
        <p>''It's funny, but the Mafia is an organization based on a bit of meritocracy,'' said Frederick T. Martens, the former executive director of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission and the former Mafia intelligence chief of the New Jersey State Police, in an interview. ''Gotti and Persico tried to shove their kids down the throats of their families, and it created enormous dissension because there are a lot of people in each family who do not think they have earned it.''</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers say the two sons admire their fathers and do not hold them responsible for their convictions. The sons would like to make Happy Father's Day calls to express their affection, but they are barred by federal rules from telephoning inmates in other prisons.</p>
        <p>After first asserting that the Gottis were victims of a vendetta by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and by federal prosecutors, Bruce Cutler, their lawyer, said that the men would ''be together in spirit'' on Father's Day.</p>
        <p>Barry Levin, Alphonse Persico's lawyer, said the son deeply regretted being unable to speak with his father but would communicate his affection and respect in letters. ''There is an incredibly close and loving relationship between my client and his father,'' he added.</p>
        <p>So far, what the authorities described as attempts by the Gottis and the Persicos to create underworld dynasties have apparently backfired. As ''acting bosses,'' the sons became the subjects of spirited investigations that led to their convictions.</p>
        <p>And, investigators say, the sons' fast-track Mafia promotions ignited dissension in the Gambino family and a bloody war in the Colombo family.</p>
        <p>Sentenced in 1992, John J. Gotti is serving a life sentence in virtual solitary confinement at the federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill. In September, his son began a sentence of six years and five months at the federal penitentiary in Ray Brook, N.Y., near Lake Placid, after pleading guilty to racketeering and extortion charges.</p>
        <p>Carmine Persico was sentenced in 1986 to combined terms of 130 years on two racketeering convictions and is at the federal penitentiary in Lompoc, Calif. In February, Alphonse Persico began an 18-month sentence in the federal penitentiary in Miami for illegal gun possession.</p>
        <p>Although the four men declined to be interviewed, through their lawyers they have steadfastly denied any involvement with the Mafia. The lawyers say that law enforcement agencies harassed the sons and manufactured cases against them because of their fathers' reputations and that the fathers had been framed by witnesses who made deals to avoid long prison terms.</p>
        <p>The Gambino and Colombo families, federal and local law enforcement officials say, are two of five major Mafia gangs based in the New York City area and are extensively involved in gambling, loan sharking and labor rackets.</p>
        <p>Current and former investigators said that John Gotti and Carmine Persico groomed their eldest sons for the Mafia. And the sons, investigators insist, relished the power, money and attention that flowed to them as mob princes.</p>
        <p>Remo Franceschini, a former lieutenant of detectives in the Police Department, recalled listening, with court authorization, to telephone conversations in the early 1980's between Mr. Gotti, who was then a Gambino capo, or captain, with his son, then in his late teens.</p>
        <p>''It was clear he was instructing him how he had to behave as a wise guy, and Gotti gloated with pride when his son was 'made,' '' Mr. Franceschini said. (''Made'' is a Mafia term for being formally inducted through a blood oath.)</p>
        <p>The younger Mr. Gotti, whose underworld nickname is Junior, grew up in Howard Beach, Queens, and attended an upstate military-style prep school. Before his conviction, he  maintained that his income came from legitimate trucking, construction and real estate businesses.</p>
        <p>J. Bruce Mouw, a former F.B.I. supervisor of the bureau's Gambino and Colombo family squads in the 1990's, said that John J. Gotti appointed his son as the Gambinos' acting boss from prison in 1994, with the intention of having him become his full-fledged successor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mouw described the younger Gotti as an inept leader in his five years as acting boss, antagonizing veteran members of the Gambino and other Mafia families. F.B.I. and Police Department investigators maintain that the younger Mr. Gotti's recklessness brought about his quick downfall. In one case, when F.B.I. agents raided his office in 1998, they found astonishingly incriminating evidence, including $358,000 in unexplained cash, a list of new Mafia members and an unregistered handgun.</p>
        <p>His erratic record as a mob chief will probably prevent him from resuming a powerful role in the Gambino family upon his release from prison in about five years, the investigators said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martens, the former Mafia intelligence chief, believes that only one of John J. Gotti's four children, his daughter, Victoria Gotti Agnello, an author of mystery novels, has capitalized on the family name. ''Her father's fame probably landed her on the best-sellers list while the same notoriety landed her brother in prison,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Alphonse Persico was raised in South Brooklyn and in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, two neighborhoods that the authorities say are Colombo family strongholds. The son, known as Allie Boy, dabbled with the idea of becoming a lawyer but dropped out of St. John's University after his sophomore year.</p>
        <p>At trials and in court proceedings, Alphonse Persico has identified himself as a businessman with real estate holdings and investments in a limousine service, a restaurant, two bagel shops and a wholesale coffee company. But what the authorities described as his criminal alliance with his father crystallized in 1986 when both men were tried and convicted together on federal racketeering charges.</p>
        <p>At the trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Aaron R. Marcu, a prosecutor, described the son as ''his father's trusted lieutenant.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marcu said the evidence at the 1986 trial disclosed that the younger Mr. Persico was an ardent recruit. ''He was taken by the life of being an important mobster,'' Mr. Marcu said. ''He was the swaggering, classic wannabe.''</p>
        <p>Carmine Persico's plan to have his son installed as acting boss when he was paroled in 1994 provoked an internecine war between two Colombo family factions in which at least 10 reputed gangsters and a bystander were killed in the early 1990's, according to the F.B.I. Investigators said that a family truce was arranged in the mid-1990's and that Alphonse Persico was recognized as acting boss by the Colombo gang last year.</p>
        <p>Mafia experts believe that Alphonse Persico's leadership is shaky because of the gun conviction in February and a separate loan sharking and fraud inquiry centering on him that federal prosecutors in Brooklyn disclosed in October.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, the sons may be sending best wishes to their fathers, but some people will be wondering whether that affection was truly returned.</p>
        <p>''What father, if he had any love or compassion for his son, would encourage him to become a mob boss or even a mobster?'' Mr. Mouw, the former F.B.I. supervisor, asked of the Gotti and Persico filial relationships. ''Who would want his son to be in danger of being killed or of being sent to jail? ''</p>
