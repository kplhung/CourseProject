        <p>It occupies a marginal space between the public and the private. It can signify wealth and virility. We always want to repress it. And everyone has some of it in his or her kitchen.</p>
        <p>Trash, the academy is ready for you.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, academics are finding that garbage -- the previously ignored contents of wastebaskets and Dumpsters -- holds vital clues to consumer culture. What people consume has long been studied on college campuses and in academic journals. But, some scholars argue, the nether part of consumerism, what people discard, may be just as important.</p>
        <p>Susan Strasser, a history professor at the University of Delaware, writes in her recent book, ''Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash,'' that ''what counts as trash depends on who's counting.'' In other words, a useless potato scrap in one culture may be a crucial soup starter in another.</p>
        <p>Why trash now?</p>
        <p>Some have grumbled that trash studies are just another academic jobs program: something grubby and controversial with shock value from which to generate paper, so to speak. But others, like Robin Nagle, who teaches a course at New York University on the anthropology of trash, view it as a timely concern. ''There's so much of it and it never goes away, and in considering our impact as a species, it's a pretty significant mark,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Academic interest in refuse was awakened a decade ago by a seminal real-world event: a garbage barge called the Mobro 4000 drifted along the world's waterways with over three tons of trash from Long Island and no place to dump it.</p>
        <p>Confronted with the prospect of homeless trash and limited space, the nation was swept with garbage guilt. Under the title ''Buried Alive,'' Newsweek ran a cover story noting that the Mobro's trip to nowhere was ''to the trash crisis what the sinking of the Lusitania was to World War I.'' But while homeowners envisioned overflowing Dumpsters and shrinking landfill space, scholars focused on the social and political effects of detritus in a culture of abundance. Had the state relegated our garbage to the private realm, as a form of political control? Do we generate trash to demonstrate our buying power, often a symbol of our sexual power?</p>
        <p>Rubbish studies should not be confused with the more practical work of solid-waste managers, who concern themselves with space: is there enough room in the world's landfills for the increasing number of plastic diapers we use?</p>
        <p>Garbologists, on the other hand, concern themselves with content: what's in whose garbage bag and what it means. ''Why wait till everyone who is throwing away stuff is dead before we tell them why it's important?'' asks William Rathje, director of the Garbage Project at the University of Arizona and co-author with Cullen Murphy of the book ''Rubbish! The Archaeology of Garbage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rathje's class actually excavates landfill and analyzes its contents to learn about what consumers use up. He got little respect from academic circles, he said, until the Mobro sailed. Then one archaeologist (who used to lump him derisively with solid-waste managers) sent him a note urging him to change his title from garbologist to garbage archaeologist. That is when Mr. Rathje knew there was room for trash in the ivory tower.</p>
        <p>In his work on trash, Mr. Rathje actually gets his hands dirty; in contrast, the theorists rummage through abstractions. Ryan Johnson is a graduate student of Victorian literature at Stanford University and the co-editor, with William Cohen, of an forthcoming essay collection, ''Filth.''</p>
        <p>''Everyone gets rid of trash; it's looked on as abject,'' he said, ''but it recirculates symbolically and you can never really get rid of it.'' The essays in Mr. Johnson and Mr. Cohen's volume will examine such topics as the relation of sanitary reform to gender identity and social class, the ideology of sanitary reform in colonial India and the use of filthy language in the radical theater of 19th-century Paris.</p>
        <p>For students of the Victorian era, the sanitary reform movement of the 19th century reflected a changing attitude toward garbage, and a broader shift in the individual's relationship to society. In documents like Edwin Chadwick's sanitary report of 1850, they see the desire for cleanliness, a value of the new bourgeoisie, leading to a mountain of trash by encouraging people to throw old things away. Ms. Strasser calls this  ''the veneration of newness.''</p>
        <p>Until the 1850's garbage was a commodity that dust pickers would pay for the right to collect. Already-used scraps were the raw material for quilts, soap, charcoal and fertilizer. Almost everything was reused. In New York City, pigs wandered the streets, eating garbage and, in turn, feeding the poor.</p>
        <p>But with reform, Londoners began paying for their garbage to be taken away. Decades later, after the period of thrift imposed during World War II, America went further and began to celebrate disposability, using paper cups -- and even paper clothing -- for purposes not only of cleanliness but of liberation from fuss as well.</p>
        <p>The popularizing of hygiene was bad news for dirt. It was no longer welcome in the public or the private realms and needed to go somewhere else -- out there, into those liminal landfills of the mind.</p>
        <p>Academics are increasingly exploring the social and psychological consequences of this repression of dirt. ''Dust: A History of the Small and the Invisible,'' by Joseph A. Amato, laments the Windex and dust-repellent household surfaces that have relegated dust to the corners of our consciousness. The study reminds us that, according to the Book of Genesis, we are all made of dust and destined to return to it, so we should appreciate the microscopic stuff that has been brutally repressed in a hygienic society.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Ms. Strasser says, the richness of waste as a topic for academic investigation lies in how people choose to designate it.</p>
        <p>''I define my topic, and my interest, not just in piles of trash but the sorting process that takes place in the marginal spaces between the public and the private,'' she writes.  ''The marginal things we're not sure of we sort in marginal spaces of the house, the attic, the basement.'' By such activities, people reveal themselves. Or, as a German philosopher might put it, we are what we throw away.</p>
