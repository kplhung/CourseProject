        <p>Exchanging pinstripes and flannel for golf shirts and madras trousers, the Arkansas Bar Association munched, sipped and talked its way through its annual summer meeting here with no official mention that its most famous member was in danger of not being a member much longer.</p>
        <p>Even in the coffee break congeniality and the cocktail hour camaraderie, many of the thousand Arkansas lawyers gathered here, the city in which Mr. Clinton spent his boyhood, were reluctant to discuss his pending disbarment case or the impact it could have on the profession seemingly in perpetual need of a public relations makeover.</p>
        <p>''It's a hush-hush sort of subject,'' H. A. Taylor, a trial judge from Pine Bluff, said with a sigh. ''Lawyers want to talk about it, but they want to talk about it privately.''</p>
        <p>When they did, their opinions on whether Mr. Clinton should be disbarred tended to break along party or ideological lines. But interviews with more than two dozen lawyers also indicated that party affiliation and voting behavior did not necessarily translate into support for a punishment less severe than disbarment.</p>
        <p>''I think it's appropriate,'' said Laura E. Partlow, a lawyer for the Arkansas Human Services Department, who said she had twice voted for Mr. Clinton for president.</p>
        <p>''He can make a contribution to society without a law license,'' Ms. Partlow said. ''I hear he's a great teacher.''</p>
        <p>John P. Lewis of Hot Springs, who was once a clerk at the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Louis, said he did not believe that Mr. Clinton's conduct rose ''to the level of disbarment.''</p>
        <p>''Most of the lawyers in my circle see it as a political issue,'' Mr. Lewis said.</p>
        <p>Ron C. Wilson of Marion, Ark., said, ''No one condones lying under oath, but I'm ambivalent'' about disbarment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson said he considered the case against Mr. Clinton to be ''somewhat political.''</p>
        <p>David K. Harp, 51, of Fort Smith, said that while stripping Mr. Clinton of his license ''seems extreme to me, the consensus I hear is that another lawyer would have been disbarred a long time ago.''</p>
        <p>It has been more than a year since a federal district judge, Susan Webber Wright, cited Mr. Clinton for contempt for giving what she described as ''intentionally false, misleading and evasive'' testimony in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual harassment case.</p>
        <p>Judge Wright fined Mr. Clinton $90,000 and referred the matter of his testimony to the Arkansas Supreme Court's Committee on Professional Conduct, which on May 19 recommended that he be disbarred. Mr. Clinton has said he will fight the action, first in circuit court at Little Rock, and, if need be, at the Arkansas Supreme Court, the state's final arbiter on law licenses.</p>
