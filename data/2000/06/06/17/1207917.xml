        <p>HAITI: VOTE PROTESTS -- Supporters of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide blocked downtown Port-au-Prince, burning tires and stoning cars to demand results from local and legislative elections held May 21. Preliminary results showed Mr. Aristide's Lavalas Family party winning 16 of 17 Senate seats and more than 20 seats in the 83-member House of Deputies. An official said final results had been given to the electoral council, but no reason has been given for the delay in their publication.</p>

The unidentified officer was relieved of his duties and returned to London pending an investigation.</p>

        <p>KOSOVO: PARTIES REGISTER FOR VOTE -- Twenty-two political parties and a coalition of six more registered by the deadline to contest local elections planned in October, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said.

        <p>MYANMAR: PRESSED ON FORCED LABOR -- The International Labor Organization has voted to open the way for Myanmar to be sanctioned for its apparently widespread use of forced labor. In a compromise between Western countries urging rapid action and Asian nations siding with Myanmar, no measures would take effect until Nov. 30. The agency's resolution asks other member countries to review their links with Myanmar and take steps to ensure it ''cannot take advantage of such relations to perpetuate or extend the system of forced or compulsory labor.''</p>

        <p>TAIWAN: WORKWEEK CUT -- The Legislature passed a bill  to cut weekly hours for blue-collar workers from 48 to 42, despite fierce opposition by owners of labor-intensive industries. The measure, to take effect in January, will add 7.5 percent to business costs in terms of overtime pay, officials said. Blue-collar workers will be able to take a Saturday off every other week, a practice adopted two years ago by civil servants.</p>

They said Prime Minister Abdul al-Raouf al-Rawabdeh, appointed in March 1999 after Abdullah became king, was widely expected to be dismissed within days or weeks.

        <p>ZIMBABWE: CAMPAIGN VIOLENCE -- Thousands of villagers have fled their homes to escape a terror campaign that has made free and fair elections impossible, rights groups said. They said more than 13,000 rural people had sought refuge in towns and cities to escape political violence ahead of elections on June 24 and 25, and others had had their identity books seized and destroyed by pro-government militants. Tony Reeler, director of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum, said there had been a ''complete subversion of the democratic electoral process.''</p>
