        <p>In a brief but tumultuous court appearance today, Mehmet Ali Agca, the gunman who shot Pope John Paul II, declared that he was ''just an actor'' in the plot that led to the 1979 slaying of one of Turkey's most prominent newspaper editors.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Agca's first public statement since he arrived in Turkey early Wednesday. He had spent 19 years in an Italian jail after being convicted of shooting the pope in 1981, but was released and sent home after John Paul appealed to the Italian authorities on his behalf.</p>

        <p>In a brief but tumultuous court appearance today, Mehmet Ali Agca, the gunman who shot Pope John Paul II, declared that he was ''just an actor'' in the plot that led to the 1979 slaying of one of Turkey's most prominent newspaper editors.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Agca's first public statement since he arrived in Turkey early Wednesday. He had spent 19 years in an Italian jail after being convicted of shooting the pope in 1981, but was released and sent home after John Paul appealed to the Italian authorities on his behalf.</p>
        <p>Mr. Agca was arrested in 1979 soon after the slaying of Abdi Ipekci, editor of the daily newspaper Milliyet, but escaped before he could be brought to trial. He was convicted of the murder in absentia and sentenced to death.</p>
        <p>The sentence was later commuted to 10 years imprisonment. Under Turkish law, Mr. Agca (pronounced AH-jah) must now serve that sentence minus the 158 days he served before escaping.</p>
        <p>''I am not the killer of Abdi Ipekci,'' Mr. Agca shouted in the Istanbul courtroom where he was brought for formal confirmation of his sentence today. ''I am just an actor. I was playing the role of a killer in that scenario.''</p>
        <p>After the presiding judge said he was considering new charges against Mr. Agca for armed robbery and other crimes, the prisoner called out: ''I am innocent. The robbery and extortion stories, they are all fairy tales. I am innocent, definitely innocent. I swear it.''</p>
        <p>When the judge ordered him to be silent, he appeared chastened and said he was overly excited after returning to his homeland. Soon afterward he was returned to his solitary cell, which is in the same prison from which he escaped more than 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>Special security measures have been imposed at the prison to ensure that people who may want to silence Mr. Agca are not able to approach him. His cell is under continuous video surveillance, and everyone entering the adjacent corridor is subject to fingerprint checks.</p>
        <p>Streets around the courtroom at which he appeared today were blocked off during his appearance. Heavily armed security officers surrounded the building, and sharpshooters were posted on nearby roofs. A handful of demonstrators chanted slogans demanding that investigators find the ''hidden hands'' that are presumed to have been behind his crimes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Agca was one of the ultra-nationalist gunmen who threw Turkey into chaos in the late 1970's. In 1979, hardly a day passed without a bombing or shooting.</p>
        <p>The military staged a coup the following year. There has been much speculation that the terror was fomented by obscure forces seeking to create a climate so frightening that such a coup would be welcome.</p>
        <p>This and various other theories about the terror campaign in which Mr. Agca participated have been revived by his sudden reappearance here. Many Turks are wondering whether he can be induced to reveal who ordered him to kill Mr. Ipekci.</p>
        <p>In the months before he was slain, Mr. Ipekci had written columns attacking far-right groups and others suggesting that heroin smugglers were working with high-ranking security officers.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Ipekci is considered a martyr, with streets and parks named after him in nearly every Turkish city.</p>
