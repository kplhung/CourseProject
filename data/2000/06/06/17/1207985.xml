        <p>JOE TORRE loosely compared it to the year he went ''from hitting .363 to being a babbling idiot.'' That would have been the 1971 and 1972 seasons, when Torre dropped from the year of a lifetime to .281, from 137 runs batted in to 81, from National League most valuable player to ordinary Joe.</p>
        <p>''To not doing what I did the year before,'' he said, relaxing in the dugout before settling in for the stress of sending Chuck Knoblauch back out to second base, where he had no throws to make last night as the Yankees lost again, this time by 3-1 to the Chicago White Sox at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch showed up, ready and willing, or ready for anything, which was an improvement on the previous night, when he committed three painful throwing errors and had a look in his eyes that convinced his manager it was time for his second baseman to hitch an immediate ride home. ''I don't know,'' Knoblauch said when asked who the driver was, which, hopefully, meant he didn't know the name of the appointed chauffeur.</p>
        <p>The experience was so discomforting that several Yankees later called, Knoblauch said, to make sure he didn't do anything rash, and we're not talking about emptying the refrigerator of fruit to practice his soft tosses out the window. In his hour of emotional need, Knoblauch would have preferred to speak to his mother, but Linda Knoblauch wasn't in and he had to wait for yesterday, when she told him she wished she could give him a hug.</p>
        <p>He arrived early in the clubhouse yesterday afternoon and received a group embrace from his close-knit team. Torre told him, ''You're my second baseman,'' and the core veterans acted as if he had gone home early Thursday night with an upset stomach, and they all continued to refute the contention that Knoblauch has become anything more than an occasional threat to the fans behind first.</p>
        <p>''If I throw the ball low, it's not the talk of the town,'' Derek Jeter said. ''If he throws the ball low, all of a sudden, everyone's bringing it up again. Every player goes through stretches where they are not catching or throwing the ball the way they like to, and if they don't tell you, they're lying.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees were lying to themselves if they believed that Knoblauch's throwing problem, which he struggled through so publicly and commendably during last year's postseason, was just going to go away. It wasn't a cycle. This isn't a slump. Torre's reduced batting average from one season to the next had a little to do with pitchers and fielders. Knoblauch, to the contrary, is unable to execute what in better times was the most natural play he could make on his own.</p>
        <p>''It's just something that happened and then you start thinking about it and then it consumes you,'' said Torre, hoping again that the problem is rooted in the flaw of the act.</p>
        <p>A sports psychologist I know once told me that the most difficult aspect of treating athletes is getting them to understand that therapy is not necessarily the act of correcting the dysfunction, but getting to the bottom of what caused it. Therapy is open-ended and nonguaranteed. Athletes by nature are a more scientific breed, staking their careers on mysteries that can be solved with mechanics and muscle.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch hinted that he had, contrary to public opinion, sought some form of off-season assistance, though his later comments suggested that it might have been along the lines of the 24-hour, self-help course that baseball ordered for another troubled soul currently lost in the wilds.</p>
        <p>John Rocker is in his own league, but Knoblauch, when asked if he thought whether his problem might be bigger than baseball, said: ''That's something maybe a psychologist or some kind of professional would know. I can't pinpoint when this all started, or if there was an event in my life that made this happen. Maybe these people will have the answers.''</p>
        <p>Steve Blass and Steve Sax and anyone else who has lived through something like this don't have them. There is no formula here. Knoblauch's issues are his own. Only he can solve them. The fans booed him Thursday night, but they stood and cheered compassionately last night when he led off the home first. He promptly singled into right field and soon turned an ankle sliding into second. He remained in the game, limping, grimacing.</p>
        <p>Fans appreciate tough guys -- the smaller, the better -- and Knoblauch, optimistically listed at 5 feet 9 inches, was showing them that he wasn't afraid to come back to the ballpark. He faced them and the news media and Tino Martinez at first.</p>
        <p>If only it was that easy for him to look within himself.</p>
