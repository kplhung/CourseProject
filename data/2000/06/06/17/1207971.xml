        <p>Along Broad Avenue here, where most of the businesses are owned by Korean-Americans, the summit meeting this week between ''the two Kims'' -- Presidents Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and Kim Jong Il of North Korea -- was universally hailed as the first tentative step toward reunification of a country that never should have been partitioned in the first place.</p>
        <p>If there was a fault line, it was generational, evidenced in the comments of Lisa Joo, 54, and her daughter, Jeannie Joo Aigner, 31, as they worked today in the family-owned Benjamin's Pharmacy.</p>
        <p>''We really want it, and we really want to believe it,'' said Mrs. Joo, the mother, explaining that many like her with relatives in North Korea feel they have a large stake in the easing of tensions and want very much to believe it will happen. But for her daughter there is a deep skepticism, born of being raised in the United States, within a community that until recently condemned all things North Korean.</p>
        <p>''The older generation's belief may be outrunning the reality,'' Ms. Joo Aigner said. ''I have never met those relatives in the North, and so they are not as real to me.  Many younger people believe that North Korea wants something now and once they get it, they will close down like in the past.''</p>
        <p>It is a community in which cynicism seems to reside more with the young, weaned on cold war pieties created by their elders.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Joo concedes that much of the haranguing of the North by the South was propaganda, intended ''to make you hate more, dislike more.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''But I have changed a lot in the last two days.''</p>
        <p>There are an estimated 400,000 Americans of Korean descent in the metropolitan area and about 150,000 of them are in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The heaviest concentration is along the Hudson River, from Fort Lee north: some 80,000 Korean-Americans live there, said Kun Y. Lee, president of the New Jersey Korean Chamber of Commerce and an appointee to the State Commission on Civil Rights. In fact, some have jokingly suggested that Fort Lee was named for a Korean.</p>
        <p>But for the last two days, wherever Korean-Americans gathered, the talk was of the summit meeting in Pyongyang, its meaning and interpretations of subtle gestures between the two leaders.</p>
        <p>At the offices of the Korean-American Senior Citizens Association in Palisades Park, the tiles for Jangki, the traditional, chess-like strategy game, and the black and white stones of the game Badook were put aside.</p>
        <p>Instead, the table was strewn with Korean-language newspapers, and about a half-dozen elderly men pored over them. They talked about the leaders' body language and tried to gauge the meaning of Kim Jong Il's decision to meet Kim Dae Jung at the airport and to provide a military honor guard.</p>
        <p>Chung Yun Taik, 76, with a smile that enveloped his face, pronounced it all ''very wonderful because we are all the same race.''</p>
        <p>His enthusiasm for the prospects of better relations and even reunification of the two Koreas was not dimmed even as he recalled that just a year ago a North Korean submarine was seized in a provocative attempt to penetrate South Korea's border.</p>
        <p>''There is some distrust, but we must try,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The most important feature of thawing relations is the possibility of reuniting with brothers, sisters and other relatives in the North who were last seen 50 years ago, said Chu Ok Kun, 67, the association's president.</p>
        <p>''Family reunification is the most important thing for the seniors,'' he said, as Kun Y. Lee translated his Korean into English. ''They are the ones who are anxious to reunite. That is their first priority.''</p>
        <p>Robert Park, 40, the president of the Korean-American Association of Northern New Jersey, said that the community was not naive and understood that the opening that North Korea had made to the South was required if the diplomatically isolated and famine-riven country was to get help in solving its problems.</p>
        <p>''I think Kim Jong Il is involved too deeply now to pull back,'' said Mr. Park, noting, as other Korean-Americans did, that there had been very secretive past diplomatic attempts at easing tensions between the two countries that came to nothing.</p>
        <p>''The whole world has been watching Pyongyang for the last three days and I think he cares too much about what the world community things about him to pull back,.'' Mr. Park said.</p>
        <p>In many ways the real story of the summit meeting to Korean-Americans here was the humanizing of the North Korean leader, who. like his despotic father, Kim Il Soong, has been shrouded in a mythic secrecy that was fertile ground for demonizing him. To see him smile and joke with Kim Dae Jung and reporters about his reputation for being reclusive, and to see him physically embrace his counterpart from the South had a powerful impact, Mr. Lee said.</p>
        <p>''Here is a leader who can do whatever he wants without consulting anyone, and he chose to do this,'' Mr. Lee said. ''That has a lot of meaning. Before, no one knew who this guy was and he chose the leader from the South to be the one to bring him out from behind his curtain. This is no joke. This is no baloney.''</p>
