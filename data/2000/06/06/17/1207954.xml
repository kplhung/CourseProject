        <p>A jury yesterday convicted Abraham Hirschfeld, the colorful parking garage developer, of trying to hire a hit man to kill a former business partner.</p>
        <p>The jury, which began deliberations on Thursday, found Mr. Hirschfeld guilty of second-degree criminal solicitation for offering to pay $150,000 in 1997 to a hit man to kill Stanley Stahl, a real estate developer who had worked with Mr. Hirschfeld for 40 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirschfeld, 80, faces up to seven years in prison. Justice Ira Beal of New York State Supreme Court is scheduled to sentence him on Aug. 1.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirschfeld and his lawyers would not comment on the verdict.</p>
        <p>It was the second time Mr. Hirschfeld, a former manager of The New York Post, was tried on the same charge. In October, a jury deadlocked after four days. In September, a jury also deadlocked in a trial in which Mr. Hirschfeld was charged with failing to pay $3.3 million in taxes between 1989 and 1995.</p>
        <p>After that trial, Mr. Hirschfeld paid all but one of the jurors $2,500 each. In building her recent case against Mr. Hirschfeld, Gilda Mariani, an assistant district attorney, relied heavily on the testimony of Joseph Veltri, one of Mr. Hirschfeld's former building developers. Mr. Veltri testified that his employer had him deliver envelopes with $75,000, a photo of Mr. Stahl and his address and license plate number to a man sitting in a limousine in Midtown Manhattan in 1996. Mr. Veltri called the police after looking into the envelopes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirschfeld is to go on trial on July 31 on the tax evasion charges.</p>
