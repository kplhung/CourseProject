        <p>Carved into the flesh of a 17-year-old student's back, block letters spelled out an anti-gay slur, a punitive label left by fellow students at Northfield Mount Hermon, a grand old boarding school here.</p>
        <p>This was not a gay-bashing hate crime, though. The victim of the carving last year was not gay. He simply liked the band ''Queen,'' and, prosecutors said, had irritated Matthew Rogers, 20, the captain of the football team, by saying that he knew Mr. Rogers liked the band, too.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Rogers's plea hearing this spring, prosecutors said the attack had been part of a broader pattern of bullying in the dormitory rooms of Northfield Mount Hermon. Renee Steese, a prosecutor, told the court that the investigation had indicated that such assaultive behavior had been going on throughout the school year. There was some evidence, Ms. Steese said, that school officials were aware of it to some degree.</p>
        <p>School officials deny that the carving assault was anything but an isolated incident.</p>
        <p>But some national experts on dormitory  life say the carving assault was an extreme example of the growing problems with the behavior of dorm residents, and boarding schools are widening their efforts to improve residential life by putting greater emphasis on it. Some schools even talk about turning it into a ''third curriculum,'' added to academics and extracurricular activities.</p>
        <p>It has never been simple to control buildings full of simmering adolescence, but in recent years, some experts say, boarding students, like their public school counterparts, have been increasingly bringing the effects of troubled childhoods to school.</p>
        <p>''I think the challenges over the last 10 years have become greater than ever,'' said Ed Kowalchick, who runs workshops on residential life for the Association of Boarding Schools, a national organization. ''Look at the statistics: Binge drinking is up, suicide attempts are up, eating disorders among men as well as women are up, depression and anxiety are up -- these are things that kids come to us with, some real concerns.''</p>
        <p>Although national organizations keep no statistics on assaults and other violence in boarding schools, experts agree that the troubling behavior of dorm residents sometimes escalates into crime.</p>
        <p>In 1997, four students at the Winchendon School in Massachusetts kicked a fellow student so hard they were charged with attempted murder. The charge was later reduced to assault and battery with a deadly weapon and the students were sentenced to one year's probation.</p>
        <p>Also in 1997, a cadet at the Marine Military Academy in Harlingen, Tex., sneaked  into the room of a classmate and slashed his throat, requiring the classmate to get 28 stitches. The student was given 10 years' probation after serving four months in jail.</p>
        <p>The academy, a private boarding school for boys, is also the target of a pending lawsuit by parents of several former students who said that classmates had physically and sexually abused their sons and the school had failed to provide proper supervision. The academy denies the charges.</p>
        <p>And last year, the Groton School in Groton, Mass., one of the most prestigious boarding schools in the country, was rocked by a boy's announcement at an assembly, before the whole school and dozens of prospective students and their parents, that there had been a series of homosexual molestations there. He was referring, his lawyer said, to assaults, corroborated by several peers, in which boys in grades 9 and 10 were held down by students and molested.</p>
        <p>''There are two very dangerous issues,'' said Peter G. Hawkins, the father of the boy who spoke out at Groton, and a financial planner in Darien, Conn. ''One is, there are some very disturbed children out there that your child is being put in contact with, but just as scary is the school that you're dealing with when the leadership is so corrupt they won't deal with the problem, where they refuse to recognize the problem.''</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Groton, Karen Schwartzman, rejected Mr. Hawkins's accusations that the school had mishandled the allegations, noting that two students had been disciplined in connection with the assaults. ''The school undertook a very thorough internal investigation and questioned every student on campus,'' Ms. Schwartzman said. ''What resulted was a series of extremely conflicting accounts and it was very hard to know, therefore, where truth began and ended.''</p>
        <p>Even before the assault at Northfield Mount Hermon, the school had been instituting new programs to help students develop morally and socially by interacting more with adults. These included seminars on issues like gender relations and a program to have students keep journals that would then be read and discussed with consulting adults.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Groton instituted additional training programs for students and faculty members on how best to handle hazing, sexual harassment, bullying and taunting.</p>
        <p>But a major problem for boarding schools is structural, the experts say. Students tend to have excellent supervision until late afternoon, they say, and then, sometimes, a hint of a style of life out of ''Lord of the Flies'' -- youth rules -- can creep in, as some faculty members go home and others try to cope with exhaustion from their roles as teachers, coaches and dormitory supervisors.</p>
        <p>Northfield Mount Hermon, one of the biggest boarding schools in the country, with 1,158 students on separate campuses that used to be schools for boys and girls, is also one of the most diverse. It tends to attract students who want strong academics but also plenty of freedom to find themselves, officials say. With a tuition of $27,000, it offers many things a college would envy: 230 major courses and 130 minor ones, a teacher-student ratio of 1 to 6, 65 sports teams, an art gallery and radio station, and more.</p>
        <p>The school requires students to work a few hours a week and seeks to instill an ethic of service in them, a tradition that dates back to its 19th-century founder, D. L. Moody, a Christian evangelist.</p>
        <p>When students arrive, the school gives them seven basic rules they must not break, such as not abusing drugs or alcohol, not stealing and not ''impinging on the rights of others.'' But in most cases, it allows students who break the rules a second chance before expelling them.</p>
        <p>At the plea hearing, it came out that two days before the carving attack, Mr. Rogers had slashed two vertical lines down the shoulder blade of another student.</p>
        <p>One parent, in an angry letter to school administrators that was forwarded to The New York Times, complained: ''From what I have heard from students at N.M.H., date rape, rape and sexual harassment are not limited to the occasional isolated incident. Much of it goes unreported out of fear.'' It is fear ''of isolation, physical threats, being called a liar, a slut,'' the parent wrote.</p>
        <p>Tom Raymond Jr., a local therapist who treated Northfield Mount Hermon students for a dozen years, said they had told him about other dorm bullies and sexual assaults and other problems as well, for example easy access to drugs, both prescription drugs like Ritalin, and illegal drugs.</p>
        <p>Several students who were interviewed on condition of anonymity confirmed the drug problem and described occasional hazing-style bullying in the boys' dorms.</p>
        <p>Of the illicit Ritalin supply, a student said: ''On any given day, if you ask one of your friends, and they talk to someone else, you've got it. You just have to have the money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Raymond, who also taught some elective classes, had proposed changing the school's counseling and discipline system to encourage students to speak to adults. Months ago, Mr. Raymond applied for but did not get a full-time job at the school and he is no longer affiliated with it. He said he believed the school's increasingly tough policies were driving the hidden and sometimes risky student life further underground.</p>
        <p>''Adults need to recognize that kids will talk honestly when we stop making it detrimental to their well-being to do so,'' Mr. Raymond said.</p>
        <p>School officials declined to respond directly to Mr. Raymond's views. But Randy S. Stevens, the dean of student life, said that he commonly fielded criticism from both those who thought he was too strict and those who thought he was too lenient. The school offers an ''elaborate web of support'' for students, from peer counselors to adult advisers, Mr. Stevens said, and students have told him they feel safe there.</p>
        <p>''The reality is that for 85 percent of our kids here at this school, they're very high-achieving kids,'' he said in an interview. ''They make it through here very successfully and have a wonderful experience. For 15 percent of our kids there are challenges.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stevens said that as part of the new residential life curriculum, students had four monthly seminars or talks on such issues as gender relations, hazing, harassment and racial identity. The school has also been consulting with researchers on how to handle adolescent boys' cruelty, he said.</p>
        <p>Other schools are taking a similar route.</p>
        <p>At the Thatcher School in Ojai, Calif., the focus on residential life ranges from the headmaster's schoolwide Saturday night invitation to a movie or cookie-baking at his house, to newer required courses on human development and sexuality.</p>
        <p>The Rumsey Hall School in Washington Depot, Conn., has begun trying to address girls' specific problems, giving them programs on leadership training and the skills needed to live in a residential community.</p>
        <p>Carol W. Hotchkiss, assistant head of Saint Mary's School in Raleigh, N.C., and a faculty member of the Association of Boarding Schools, said: ''A lot of different schools I've consulted with, 10 years ago they couldn't have cared less what was going on in the dorms, just, 'Keep them quiet, have them study and don't let them crawl around outside.' Now they're coming to people like me and saying, 'Help us develop a residential curriculum,' the words for which didn't exist 10 years ago.''</p>
        <p>In general, few would argue that crime among the estimated 2 percent of the nation's students who live in boarding schools is worse than at day schools. But the students' 24-hour-a-day presence at schools leaves them vulnerable to assaults at times when most day students would be safe at home.</p>
        <p>At the plea hearing in the Northfield Mount Hermon carving assault, the victim's father told the court that his son's back, though healing, was still scarred, and the boy refuses to take off his shirt or swim in public. Prosecutors say the letters were about three or four inches in length, that they bled but did not require stitches, and that the boys who carved them also swabbed hydrogen peroxide on the cuts afterward.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers, who wielded the knife, pleaded guilty to two charges of assault and battery and was given a suspended sentence of two and a half years and placed on probation for three years. He had previously been accepted on full scholarship into the United States Naval Academy, but that offer was rescinded after the carving assault.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers's accomplice, Jonathan Shapiro, 19, pleaded guilty to assault and battery and was sentenced to three years' probation.</p>
        <p>When asked why he had done the carving, Mr. Rogers told the Superior Court judge:  ''There was no point. It was a terrible error on my part.''</p>
        <p>But the victim's father said: ''We all make choices about our conduct. The choice that Matt made, and Jonathan, was to exhibit power over people.''</p>
