        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Opponents to the state initiatives for universal health care (front page, June 11) play on certain fears, as if the current health care system were not already permeated with fear.</p>
        <p>First is the fear of destruction of the current managed-care networks that are already so abusive of patients and restrictive of choice. Second is the fear that change would bring chaos to an already chaotic jumble. Third is the perennial claim of increased costs -- even though independent studies like two commissioned last year by the Massachusetts Medical Society found that millions of dollars would be saved at the same time that 600,000 uninsured people in the state would be covered.</p>
        <p>Could it be that opponents only want to protect their profits?</p>
