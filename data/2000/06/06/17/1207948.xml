        <p>For decades, this remote town overlooking the chocolate-colored waters of the Amazon River has been the main source of guarana, a bright-red, highly caffeinated berry that is believed by many Brazilians to be an aphrodisiac.</p>
        <p>Inspired by a Romeo-and-Juliet-esque legend that guarana had originated from a tempestuous affair between two teenagers from rival Indian tribes, Brazilians have consumed guarana in a variety of forms: teas, tablets -- even soft drinks.</p>
        <p>These days, guarana provides a clear example of the way many of the 20 million Brazilians living in the Amazon River Basin are seeking to harness the region's exotic flora and fauna to promote economic development.</p>
        <p>''What better product to represent the Amazon than a natural stimulant that is harvested without harming the environment?'' said Valmir Ferrari, an agronomist with Companhia de Bebidas das Americas, a Brazilian beverage company planning to export a guarana soft drink to rich industrialized nations in a venture with PepsiCo. ''This could be bigger than Viagra.''</p>
        <p>While the libido-enhancing effects of guarana may have more to do with fiction than fact, it is no small wonder that products from the Amazon, a region that has long gripped popular imagination as the world's largest rain forest, are being viewed as a way for the region to develop without harming the environment at a time when other forces are threatening to speed its depletion.</p>
        <p>Several huge road projects are under way to link the Amazon with other parts of Brazil and are apt to increase migration to the region. The expected increase in commerce resulting from better integration with the rest of the country is expected to increase pressure on an already precarious infrastructure, according to a report recently released by groups including the World Wildlife Fund.</p>
        <p>And traditional threats to the Amazon, like cattle ranching, timber cutting and wide-scale soybean farming, continue to loom large. According to a separate report issued by Brazil's environment ministry, an area of 6,347 square miles of rain forest, roughly the size of the state of Hawaii, was destroyed last year as a result of such activities.</p>
        <p>So it is no surprise that some of the Amazon's business and political interests have begun to carry the flag of environmentally friendly economic development projects. According to Joao Capiberibe, the governor of Amapa, one of the nine states making up the Brazilian Amazon, it is a question of economic survival.</p>
        <p>''The global economy we are becoming part of is one in which diversity produces riches,'' said Mr. Capiberibe, whose government is viewed as a pioneer after prohibiting wood cutting and soybean farming. To replace these activities, Amapa is supporting the production of organically harvested hearts-of-palm and oil from cashew nuts.</p>
        <p>There are similar efforts taking place in other Amazonian states. One of the most commercially promising sustainable development projects is under way on tracts of land where the rain forest was already razed to make way for activities like ranching in Para, a state neighboring Amapa.</p>
        <p>There, a company called AgroPalma is using the region's ample humidity and sunlight to grow African oil palm trees to produce palm oil, which is used as a cooking oil in the cuisine of northeastern Brazil and by food processors to make products like margarine and shortening.</p>
        <p>AgroPalma hopes to make Brazil a contender in the palm oil industry, allowing the country to compete with Malaysia, the leading producer, and other Asian nations. One of the company's main selling points is the view that the palm oil business is an agricultural activity that does not harm the rain forest.</p>
        <p>''We defend the rational exploitation of the environment,'' said Harald Brunckhorst, executive director of AgroPalma, which is backed by Aloizio Faria, one of Brazil's most prominent financiers. ''Palm trees take so well on land that has been degraded by other types of farming or ranching so we don't have to clear new lands to cultivate.''</p>
        <p>Additionally, the company is eyeing the potential of the organic food market by seeking to increase ecologically certified production. For instance, AgroPalma is reducing the use of pesticides by using natural biocontrol agents from the rain forest to combat plant diseases transmitted by insects, like spear rot.</p>
        <p>''Our organic production is 10 percent and growing,'' Mr. Brunckhorst said. ''It is the best way to gain market share in the first world.''</p>
        <p>Because the palm oil business is labor-intensive, its advocates also claim that it is a viable alternative to economic activities like gold mining, which pollutes water sources in the Amazon through miners' use of mercury. And jobs on palm oil plantations operated by AgroPalma and other companies could alleviate migration to large Amazonian cities like Manaus and Belem.</p>
        <p>''Any economic project in the Amazon is useless if it does not take into account people's livelihood in addition to the environmental impact,'' said Eduardo Morales, director for the eastern Amazon region at Embrapa, the government's agricultural research institute. ''The rain forest cannot be preserved if the people living in it cannot feed and school their children.''</p>
        <p>While palm oil is one of the few environmentally sound products from the Amazon that have large-scale corporate potential -- AgroPalma's clients include companies like Frito-Lay -- there are several companies and small cooperatives that are selling exotic products with tongue-twisting names like cupuacu, a fruit used to make juices and chocolate, or pirarucu, a freshwater fish that can grow to be nearly nine feet long.</p>
        <p>''The quickest way for an Amazonian to get some control over his economic destiny is to get involved in small-scale sustainable-development projects,'' said Moacyr Bittencourt, the program officer for marketing natural products in Brazil for the World Wildlife Fund.</p>
        <p>That group is involved in projects to sell sandals made from rubber collected by rubber tappers in the western state of Acre, which was home to the rain forest advocate Chico Mendes before his murder in 1988, in addition to a reforestation project in the state of Amapa to help people there break into the market for aromatic timber like rosewood.</p>
        <p>For any of these projects to succeed, their directors might benefit from studying previous efforts to develop businesses in the Amazon. The region, larger than Western Europe, has a spectacular history of failures to establish viable enterprises.</p>
        <p>In the center of Manaus, the region's largest city and one that is a 16-hour boat ride from Maues, an ornate turn-of-the-century opera house and a few European-style buildings are all that remain of the Amazon boom of a century ago from rubber production. Competition from Asian rubber producers eventually wiped out the wealth of Manaus, leaving behind these symbols.</p>
        <p>Or there is Fordlandia, a far-flung American-style outpost in the state of Para established by Henry Ford in the 1920's to produce carnauba wax, used in the production of rubber. All that remains of Fordlandia, which halted production at the end of World War II, are a few buildings and a church. Cattle graze on what was once a golf course.</p>
        <p>More recently, Daniel Ludwig, an American shipping magnate, invested nearly $1 billion in a project to produce cellulose and other products on a Connecticut-sized property near the border of the states of Para and Amapa, only to have the debt-ridden enterprise fall into disarray.</p>
        <p>If there is any company that is intent on avoiding the fate of these ventures it is AmBev, the company planning to export a guarana drink with Pepsi. It already has Pepsi's experience to learn from, since Pepsi, based in Purchase, N.Y., stopped making a guarana drink called Josta shortly after introducing it in 1996.</p>
        <p>In five years, AmBev hopes to capture 1 percent of the $70 billion global soft drink market with its Antarctica Guarana brand, labeled a ''Rain Forest Original'' on bright green cans and bottles.</p>
        <p>Although AmBev's installations in Maues are impressive, including a well-kept guarana plantation on the town's outskirts and a research center in the town, it is clear that the guarana used to produce AmBev's soft drinks is only a minuscule part of the process.</p>
        <p>While AmBev does not disclose the secret formula of its guarana drink, it acknowledges that the percentage of the berry in the mixture is kept to a minute level so children can consume it without getting too much stimulation. After all, guarana has three times as much caffeine as coffee.</p>
        <p>''Our aim is to capitalize on the allure the Amazonian rain forest has in the imagination of the entire world,'' said Victorio de Marchi, co-president of AmBev. ''How to convey this is probably more a job for our marketing people than it is for our researchers.''</p>
