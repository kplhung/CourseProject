        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>CHALLENGING GORE'S TAX PROPOSAL -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas yesterday accused his Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore, of doubling the size of a proposed tax cut as a result of polls. ''Surely America doesn't want a focus-group-driven presidency,'' Mr. Bush said. ''America wants somebody who makes decisions based on what's right, and what's right is sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bill.'' He called his proposal for a 10-year, across-the-board tax cut of $1.3 trillion preferable to Mr. Gore's latest plan for $500 billion in tax credits and deductions aimed at particular needs like education and child care. ''Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief,'' Mr. Bush said in Canton, Ohio. Douglas Hattaway, Mr. Gore's spokesman, said, ''We need to use our prosperity wisely and give tax relief to working middle-class families.''</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>AN EDGE TO BUSH -- A day after Vice President Al Gore replaced his campaign manager, he awoke to yet another sign of the struggle he faces. A nationwide poll by The Los Angeles Times found Gov. George W. Bush leading Mr. Gore by a 10-point margin, 50 percent to 40 percent, and it found that Mr. Bush's support among Republicans was stronger than Mr. Gore's support among Democrats. Nine of 10 Republicans said they backed Mr. Bush, while 7 of 10 Democrats said they supported Mr. Gore. Mr. Bush also had substantially more support among Democrats than Mr. Gore had among Republicans. The poll surveyed more than 1,600 voters in the past week and has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>A STAND-IN WITH A PUNCH -- Gov. George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, often say that when she agreed to marry him, it was on the condition that she would never have to give a political speech. But yesterday, Mrs. Bush addressed more than 10,000 people at the Texas Republican Party's convention in Houston. She was substituting for her husband and was mixing just a little vinegar into her remarks. She said that as her husband started his quest for the presidency, she had vowed to avoid newspapers and the inevitably critical articles and instead stick to fiction. ''But then I found out a lot of it was on the editorial page,'' she said.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>THE TROUBLE WITH BOSSES -- There was one big drawback for Elaine Elliott when she made it into a runoff to be the Democratic nominee for the clerk of court in Georgetown County, S.C. That became clear when Ms. Elliott came to work on Wednesday, the day after the primary election. She said her boss, Ruby Moore, the current clerk of court, was waiting with a letter telling her she was fired. Ms. Elliott, the deputy clerk of court, made the mistake of beating her boss by 19 votes, winning the right to face the top vote-getter, Alma White, in the runoff on June 27. Ms. Moore confirmed that she fired Ms. Elliott. ''I'm not vindictive,'' she said.</p>
