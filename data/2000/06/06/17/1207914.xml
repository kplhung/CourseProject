        <p>Ray Price's clip-clopping shuffle rhythm -- the stamp of his sound since his earliest hits -- was at the bottom of every song he performed at the Bottom Line on Wednesday. It didn't matter whether he was singing hard-core honky-tonk or mellifluous soft pop like ''Danny Boy,'' with the 10-piece string section he had hired bowing along. The Ray Price beat was always there.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1950's country music needed a strong dance rhythm to contend with the force of rockabilly. Mr. Price provided it.</p>
        <p>His early singles -- ''Crazy Arms'' was a major hit in 1957 -- influenced country music deeply for the next 10 years, creating a sturdy, stock sound. In it, pedal steel and fiddles introduced the song and took a chorus to themselves in the middle; an electric bass played walking figures through it; and the drummer shuffled briskly so that a singer could linger over words without slowing the song down.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Price soon moved on from his own invention, embracing pure middle-of-the-road pop. His smooth, crooning voice and lack of a pronounced Southern accent made his music palatable for a wider audience, starting endless subsequent arguments (recent ones revolve around Shania Twain) about what makes a song ''country'' if most of its distinguishing marks are pop-derived.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Price's first New York show in 30 years, and he added string players from the Manhattan School of Music to augment his core quintet.  With prominent steel-guitar solos and a swath of violins, he has arrived at a pretty neat compromise between his early and latter-day styles. It's powerful to hear famous old songs the way they're supposed to be heard, and the first half-hour of Wednesday's late set was riveting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Price, now 75, is in good shape and good voice. He stood against the piano almost motionless, serene as a retiree on a golfing vacation, singing a string of old songs like ''San Antonio Rose,'' ''Crazy Arms'' and ''Heartaches by the Number.'' They all had the same rhythm, and his oaky tenor treated them carefully.</p>
        <p>A glazing sameness began to settle in after that, but there were moments: the song ''The Only Bridge,'' with its perfect country double meaning (''the only bridge you haven't burned/is the one you're standing on''), and the poignant James Throckmorton song ''I Wish I Was 18 Again,'' a bar stool tale of a man who is ''three-quarters home from the start/to the end''; and the Spanish ballad ''Mirame.''</p>
        <p>That last song may have been political insurance against the cornpone race jokes tossed around between Mr. Price and his barrel-chested pianist and Mexican-American musical director of three decades, Moises Calderon, which were just this side of scabrous. But it was a routine, and Mr. Calderon gave as good as he got. And he came out from behind the piano to sing a song himself -- ''El Rancho Grande,'' in the Tex-Mex two-beat rhythm -- while wearing a gigantic sombrero.</p>
        <p>Slowing down toward the end of the song, Mr. Calderon grew mock  confessional. ''Boy, I hate to wear this hat,'' he said. ''It makes me look fat.'' He paused and surveyed the crowd. ''It makes some of you look fat, too.''</p>
