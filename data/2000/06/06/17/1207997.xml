        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A June 11 front-page article described various state efforts to get measures calling for universal health care coverage on the ballot. Unfortunately, such noble attempts are unlikely to succeed unless they embody these guidelines:</p>
        <p>A mandate should be passed clearly stating that each citizen is responsible for buying health insurance, even if his employer irresponsibly neglects to buy it on his behalf. State laws must be modified to allow the sale of ''bare bones,'' low-priced insurance policies. The federal and state governments must subsidize most of the insurance costs for lower-income individuals.</p>
        <p>If these policies were put into effect today, there would be no un-insured Americans next week.</p>
        <p>KENNETH S. ABRAMOWITZ  New York, June 14, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a health care analyst.</p>
