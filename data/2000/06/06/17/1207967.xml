        <p>The trustee brought in to reverse the slide of the city's largest janitors' union announced this week that he would run for the union's presidency, after recommending that the parent union end the trusteeship.</p>
        <p>The trustee of Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International Union, Michael Fishman, who was brought in from the parent union in Washington, said he decided to seek the presidency because many union members had asked him to run.</p>
        <p>But some members of the local, which represents 55,000 workers, said it was unfair that an outsider, who controlled the union's apparatus, had decided to seek the presidency. They said that other candidates hardly had a chance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fishman impressed many members of the local in April when he negotiated a contract that improved pensions and raised wages by 10.5 percent over three years for 26,000 apartment building janitors, doormen and elevator operators. Mr. Fishman, who has run the local for 10 months, has also begun an ambitious organizing drive to reverse the membership losses the local suffered under its former president, Gus Bevona. The parent union placed Local 32B-32J into trusteeship in February 1999 when it forced Mr. Bevona into retirement out of anger over his large salary and the extravagant penthouse he maintained at union headquarters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fishman said he asked the parent union to end the trusteeship because the local's finances were in good shape and because the parent union's rules call for ending most trusteeships within 18 months. With the election scheduled for the second week in August, Mr. Fishman sounded very much the candidate in an interview.  ''We have built an honest union with lots of participation,'' he said. ''We have good people in place, and we are increasing our membership. We have a good organizing campaign.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fishman, who is heading a slate with 50 other candidates, has begun what is one of the metropolitan region's most ambitious organizing drives in years. Over the next three years, he wants to unionize more than 20,000 nonunion building workers in New York City, New Jersey and Long Island -- workers who often earn $7 an hour, compared with the $16 an hour earned by the local's members.</p>
        <p>Some dissident members formed a group this week to oppose Mr. Fishman's  election plans. They complained that the parent union had changed the bylaws to let an outsider run. They also complained that  the election schedule did not leave enough time for a challenger to mount a full campaign. ''It's just an illusion of democracy,'' said Steven Dammaker, a building superintendent in Greenwich Village. In a leaflet, the dissidents' committee wrote: ''This is not Democratic. It is Autocratic.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fishman said that with nearly two months to go before the election, the time for campaigning was adequate, and typical for the service employees' union.</p>
        <p>Carlos Guzman, a longtime dissident and one of Mr. Bevona's staunchest opponents, has also announced plans to run for president. Many dissidents say that with the city's real estate market booming, Mr. Fishman should have obtained a better wage and pension package than he did from the real estate industry.</p>
