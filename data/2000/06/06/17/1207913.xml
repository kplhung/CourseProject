      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Microsoft accused its rivals today of masterminding an attempt to buy trash generated by a Microsoft-backed lobbying organization, apparently hoping the trash would yield valuable information on the company.</p>
        <p>The accusation came as the Justice Department filed another brief in the antitrust case against the company. It sought to counter a Microsoft brief filed Thursday opposing the government's effort to send the company's appeal in the case directly to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The trash-buying effort was first reported by Wired.com on Thursday evening and The Wall Street Journal today.</p>
        <p>On June 1 and June 6, a woman identifying herself as Blanca Lopez offered to pay a worker from a cleaning service to hand over the trash from the offices of the Association for Competitive Technology in downtown Washington, according to documents from the company that manages the association's office space.</p>
        <p>The workers refused each time -- even when, on the second attempt, they were offered $500 each, plus another $200 for their supervisor, the documents state. The second attempt came the day before Justice Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his order to break up Microsoft.</p>
        <p>The association, chartered in 1998, is heavily financed by Microsoft and has been a strong and unwavering supporter of the company in its antitrust battle with the government as well as in other issues.</p>
        <p>''It's no secret that our competitors have pursued an orchestrated and aggressive campaign against us,'' said Vivek Varma, a Microsoft spokesman, ''and this suggests that they are willing to go to extraordinary and unseemly lengths to attack our company.''</p>
        <p>Jonathan Zuck, head of the association, agreed. But Mr. Zuck and Mr. Varma both acknowledged that they had not been able to determine which competitor, if any, was behind the trash-buying effort -- though they did say they considered it reasonable to surmise that a Microsoft rival was involved. The Washington police are investigating the episode but have not said what they may have discovered.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zuck said a private investigative company, Investigative Group International, appeared to have been involved, though he and others said they did not know who might have hired the company. Investigative Group International said it would not discuss its clients or activities.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lopez, according to the documents, gained after-hours entrance to the office building and the office suite where the Association for Competitive Technology has its offices using the pass key of an entity called Upstream Technologies, which had rented an office nearby last month. But Upstream appears to be a dummy company; association officers say they believe the private investigators rented the space under the name of Upstream just to be near the association's offices.</p>
        <p>Separately, someone broke into Microsoft's offices near Dupont Circle, two miles away, earlier this week, the company said. Nothing has been found to be missing, and the offices of two other unrelated companies in the same building were broken into the same night. So Microsoft officials say they have drawn no conclusions about that break-in.</p>
        <p>In the latest move on the legal front, the government responded to an assertion by Microsoft that the Expediting Act, allowing direct appeal to the Supreme Court of important federal antitrust cases, does not apply to the companion case against Microsoft filed by 19 states.</p>
        <p>The government brief today noted that even if the Microsoft argument was correct, the states will file a writ of certiorari, which allows defendants or plaintiffs to petition the Supreme Court for direct appeal of any case before the Court of Appeals.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court seldom grants such writs. But Tom Goldstein, a Washington lawyer who argues cases before the Supreme Court, said, ''This is the sort of circumstance when it is permitted, when there's a sister case already up there.''</p>
