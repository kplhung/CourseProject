        <p>Police Commissioner Howard Safir said yesterday that as many as five officers would probably be disciplined for failing to respond properly to people who complained about a group of men attacking women in and around Central Park on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir also announced 8 more arrests in the attacks, which occurred after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, bringing to 16 the total number of young men arrested  in a frenzy of sexual assaults, including seven who turned themselves in after seeing their pictures broadcast on television or published in newspapers.</p>

        <p>Police Commissioner Howard Safir said yesterday that as many as five officers would probably be disciplined for failing to respond properly to people who complained about a group of men attacking women in and around Central Park on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir also announced 8 more arrests in the attacks, which occurred after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, bringing to 16 the total number of young men arrested  in a frenzy of sexual assaults, including seven who turned themselves in after seeing their pictures broadcast on television or published in newspapers.</p>
        <p>Detectives have also identified 14  more suspects being sought in the attacks, in which men poured ice and water on dozens of women, tore at their clothes and groped their breasts and buttocks.</p>
        <p>As detectives continued to hunt for the attackers, investigators from the department's Internal Affairs Bureau pursued their own inquiry, looking into complaints that some officers failed to respond properly to people who notified them of the roving bands of men. By late yesterday,  department investigators had questioned well over 100 officers, mostly supervisors, a senior investigator said.</p>
        <p>''Without prejudging, my sense is that we will probably find four or five police officers who acted inappropriately, while the vast majority acted appropriately,'' Mr. Safir said. ''Those who acted inappropriately will be subject to discipline.''</p>
        <p>The senior investigator said that the Internal Affairs Bureau had solid identifications on three or four officers who they said they believed had acted improperly and were close on one or two others. The official said it was possible that one or more of the officers would face dismissal, but called that eventuality unlikely.</p>
        <p>One of the police officers who has become a focus of the inquiry was  assigned to a traffic detail and was seen on a videotape on which a man who is not visible is upbraiding him for failing to take some action, a senior police official said. But the investigation has not yet determined whether the officer had failed to take any action.</p>
        <p>The senior investigator pointed out that if the Internal Affairs Bureau  determines that an officer behaved improperly, the department would bring administrative charges against the officer, who would then be tried before an administrative law judge. The judge's recommendation would be given to the police commissioner, who makes the final decision on departmental discipline.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir said that of the seven victims who reported their assaults to police immediately after the incident, two complained about the officers and five praised their behavior.</p>
        <p>The eight suspects arrested yesterday were Julio Delacruz, 22, of 7717 Bergenline Avenue in North Bergen, N.J.; Isaiah Forbes, 18, of 119 Beach 56th Street, Queens; Mark Daniels, 21, of 67 Harrison Place in Irvington, N.J.; Anthony Bryant, 25, of 312 Delancey Street in Manhattan; Leslie Marcano, 19, of 995 Simpson Street in the Bronx; Soto Jensen, 16, of 99 Varet Street, Brooklyn; Trevor Britton, 29, of 1401 East New York Avenue, Brooklyn; and David Garcia, 33, of 2406 Grand Avenue in the Bronx. Authorities said all would be charged with first-degree sexual abuse and first-degree riot.</p>
        <p>''One thing I can tell you is there is no pattern here as far as groups of people who are associated with each other,'' Mr. Safir said. ''This appears to be something that happened relatively spontaneously.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir also thanked the public for its cooperation, saying the department's release of photographs of the suspects, lifted from 10 amateur videotape recordings, prompted scores of calls to the Crime Stoppers phone line. One tip came from as far away as Italy, where someone who had been in New York on Sunday sent an e-mail message to the police with what Mr. Safir said was helpful information. The new suspects whose photographs were released yesterday had all been identified by one or more of the 47 victims who the police said had been molested, and in some cases, assaulted or robbed.</p>
