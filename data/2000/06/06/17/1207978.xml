        <p>Gamblers would be able to weigh their odds of winning at different  casinos under a proposal by state regulators to lift a ban on odds advertising. The ban was written into the New Jersey Casino Control Act, which legalized casino gambling in the state in 1978.</p>

        <p>Gamblers would be able to weigh their odds of winning at different  casinos under a proposal by state regulators to lift a ban on odds advertising. The ban was written into the New Jersey Casino Control Act, which legalized casino gambling in the state in 1978.</p>
        <p>The change is one of several amendments to the gambling law now being written by the Division of Gaming Enforcement and the Casino Control Commission, the two state agencies that regulate New Jersey's 12 casinos in Atlantic City.</p>
        <p>The enforcement division had already notified the casinos, in an April 19 letter, that it would no longer enforce the ban, after a June 1999 decision by the United States Supreme Court. The court overturned a similar, federal ban involving Indian casinos after a lawsuit was filed in 1994 by the New Orleans Broadcasting Association.</p>
        <p>As it was written, New Jersey's gambling law banned casinos from advertising odds-related elements, like the frequency of slot-machine jackpots and the house's winning percentage at blackjack tables.</p>
        <p>Regulators also propose lifting bans on advertising the size of a casino and the types of table games and electronic gambling available. J. P. Suarez, director of the gaming enforcement division, said the amendments would be submitted to the Legislature this summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suarez, who is an assistant state attorney general, said that the amendments would merely bring state law in line with the Supreme Court's ruling, and that he expected them to be approved and signed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. ''Commercial speech such as advertisement of odds is good for the consumer,'' Mr. Suarez said.</p>
        <p>Officials said the odds-advertising ban had been intended to prevent what were considered deceitful advertising practices by Las Vegas casinos.</p>
        <p>Laura M. Letson, executive director of the New York Council on Problem Gambling, agreed that odds advertising might be a useful tool for casino visitors, but she cautioned that it might also aggravate compulsive-gambling problems. She said the state must be willing to ensure truth in advertising, and Mr. Suarez vowed that his agency would do just that.</p>
        <p>But within the gambling industry, there is concern that odds advertising could lead to an ''odds war'' among casinos that are now able -- even obligated, by demands of the marketplace -- to advertise their odds. While beneficial to consumers, it could hurt the state's gambling industry, which employs tens of thousands of people and provides hundreds of millions of dollars in annual tax revenues to the state each year.</p>
        <p>Alan Feldman, a spokesman for MGM Grand, which is developing an Atlantic City casino with Boyd Gaming of Las Vegas, said, ''I think our industry needs to use a lot of discretion in the way it promotes itself.''</p>
