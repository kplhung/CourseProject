        <p>AT the United States Open, the golfers always had something to say about what Trent Jones had wrought. Seldom was it complimentary.</p>
        <p>''Jones has so many doglegs on this course,'' Bob Rosburg said at Hazeltine National in 1970, ''he must have laid it out in a kennel.''</p>
        <p>After winning at Oakland Hills in 1951 with a 67 in the final round, Ben Hogan said, ''I'm glad I brought this course, this monster, to its knees.'' And at a reception later, Hogan turned to Trent Jones's wife, Ione.</p>
        <p>''If your husband had to play this course for a living,'' Hogan said, ''you'd be on the bread line.''</p>
        <p>Over the years, the golfers have come to expect an Open course to be altered simply to make them do what they don't want to do: think. As it was here at Pebble Beach with a few new tees as well as new seawall bunkers on the 17th and 18th holes. All created explicitly for this 100th Open.</p>
        <p>Somewhere Trent Jones is smiling.</p>
        <p>For half a century now, the Open has been played on famous courses, no matter how old and how traditional, that are always altered to make life more exacting for the world's best golfers. And that's the legacy of Robert Trent Jones Sr., the celebrated golf architect who died in his sleep at 93 just as this Open was about to begin Thursday.</p>
        <p>''The timing of his death was spooky,'' his son Rees was saying. ''For years the Open was his stage.''</p>
        <p>Rees Jones is now what his father was, the architect often hired by the United States Golf Association to perform a face lift on an Open course. He and his brother, Robert Trent Jones Jr., have been involved in designing more than 250 courses worldwide after having studied under their father.</p>
        <p>''He thought of himself as the defender of par,'' Rees Jones said. ''He thought that a tournament with a lot of subpar rounds was a fraud.''</p>
        <p>For the 1951 Open at Oakland Hills outside Detroit, Trent Jones was the first to redo an Open course. Oakland Hills had been used for two previous Opens -- in 1924 when Cyril Walker finished two strokes ahead of Bobby Jones and in 1937 when Ralph Guldahl won. But for the 1951 Open, the U.S.G.A. knew that it needed a more difficult look.</p>
        <p>''He rebunkered Oakland Hills,'' Rees Jones said. ''And his contoured greens made the golfers think about whether to go for the flag or not.''</p>
        <p>Oakland Hills was suddenly golf's ''monster.'' In that 1951 Open none of the world's best golfers broke par 70 until the final round, when Hogan shot 67 for a seven-over-par 287 to win by two strokes. Clayton Haefner shot 69 to finish second.</p>
        <p>Others also complained about the severity of Jones's changes, but Gene Sarazen, then the only golfer to have won all four of the major tournaments, praised them.</p>
        <p>''The course was a masterpiece,'' Sarazen wrote in a letter to the U.S.G.A. hierarchy. ''It was a challenge to the players, but the best players finished on top.''</p>
        <p>After that, the U.S.G.A. hired Trent Jones whenever it thought an Open course needed changes, whether subtle or drastic.</p>
        <p>The loudest uproar occurred in 1970 at Hazeltine National outside Minneapolis, a relatively new course that Jones had designed. After a practice round, Jack Nicklaus, who had already won two of his four Open titles, complained that Hazeltine lacked definition.</p>
        <p>''My father told Jack, 'You won't play well because you're already fighting the course,' '' Rees Jones said. ''He was right.''</p>
        <p>Nicklaus shot 81-72-75-76 to tie for 51st as England's Tony Jacklin won with a seven-under-par total of 281, but that Open is remembered for Dave Hill's comment.</p>
        <p>Asked what Hazeltine lacked, Hill, who would finish second with even par 288, replied, ''Eighty acres of corn and a few cows.''</p>
        <p>Besides Rosburg, others complained about all the dogleg holes that created too many blind shots, either from the tees or to the greens, but Ben Crenshaw, now a two-time Masters winner and a celebrated golf architect who was low amateur in that 1970 Open, defended Jones's design.</p>
        <p>''All those blind shots,'' Crenshaw said, ''aren't blind after your first practice round.''</p>
        <p>Trent Jones was just trying to make the world's best golfers play golf. Trying to make them think instead of just teeing it high and letting it fly. Trying to make par important. And because of what he wrought, the Open is based on that philosophy.</p>
