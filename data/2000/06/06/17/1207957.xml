        <p>A little help from his best friend helped Ishmael Acevedo slip into the auditorium of his East Harlem school yesterday, one of two New York City schools President Clinton visited to express his support for music education and to lobby for billions of dollars in school construction bonds.</p>
        <p>Ishmael, 10 years old, had brought in a yellow permission slip signed by his parents that would allow him to participate in the presidential visit. But as he earnestly explained, ''I ain't have the right tie.''</p>
        <p>His best friend, on the other hand, had forgotten the permission slip but had worn the regulation maroon plaid tie that is part of the Public School 96 uniform, and he generously gave it to Ishmael.</p>
        <p>So while his friend was sequestered with 250 others in the lunchroom, Ishmael was among a lucky four or five dozen students in the auditorium, sitting just a few rows away as Mr. Clinton reminisced about three of his childhood music teachers and stood by as a music foundation promised $5 million worth of musical instruments to city schools over the next five years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton charmed Ishmael and the audience of children, teachers and officials from the Board of Education as he recounted how his mother had tolerated his squawking on the saxophone until he got good at it, and how Hillary Rodham Clinton had set up a private music room for him ''way down a hall'' on the top floor of the White House, ''where nobody could hear.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, he said, he retreats there to play the saxophone for 15 or 20 minutes and comes out, ''full of energy, ready to start again.''</p>
        <p>It was a day of campaignlike stops for the president, who was not actually campaigning for himself. He was joined at both schools by Harold O. Levy, the schools chancellor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton never mentioned his wife's campaign for the Senate. But coincidentally or not, Mr. Clinton used his next stop, at P.S. 131, an overcrowded school in Jamaica Estates. Queens, to lobby for a $25 billion school construction bond act that has also been mentioned by Mrs. Clinton in her recent campaign appearances. Her opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, has opposed the plan. When the president lamented that the House and Senate leadership had not adequately supported his school financing proposals, someone in the audience shouted, ''Hillary,'' and Mr. Clinton responded, ''That's not a bad idea.''</p>
        <p>The proposed legislation would help modernize 6,000 schools across the country, Mr. Clinton said, with much of the money going to the poorest districts, including $1.5 billion to New York City.</p>
        <p>The most eloquent speech came from Mary Minnick, a fourth-grade teacher who has worked at P.S. 131 for more than 33 years, since, as she said, Lyndon Johnson was president. When she started, she said, the school had 400 children, with two classes for each grade, an indoor play area, a library, a music room and ''even a dental clinic.'' All the students ate lunch at the same time.</p>
        <p>Now, she said, it is ''a traffic jam,'' with 900 children, many housed in portable classrooms outdoors, reading classes in the hall and music in the lunchroom. There are three lunch shifts, beginning at 10:30 a.m., and the playroom is long gone.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Clinton's appearance in Queens had the tone of a stump speech, complete with local elected officials, his visit to East Harlem was a bit quirkier.</p>
        <p>Air conditioners had been installed in two rooms at P.S. 96 for the president's visit, but the auditorium was still sweltering, because windows were closed for security reasons. As teachers distributed bottled water, Mr. Clinton shared the stage with the singers Billy Joel and Brian McKnight, in a testament to the clout of VH1, the cable music station, which sponsored the event with Viacom, its parent company.</p>
        <p>Viacom's chairman, Sumner Redstone, whose net worth is $12.1 billion, according to Forbes magazine, was also there, but did not say a word, letting his money do the talking as the VH1 Save the Music Foundation announced its donation of $5 million in musical instruments.</p>
        <p>A student at P.S. 96, Kelvin Eusebio, gamely told the audience that his speech had been written for him by an adult, then delivered it -- full of big words and bigger sentiments -- with great polish and flair.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton congratulated P.S. 96, one of the worst-performing schools in the city, for what he said was a rise in third-grade reading scores by more than 300 percent, to 74 percent of the children reading above grade level from 20 percent. The improvement for the school as a whole was much more modest, with 22.3 percent of the students meeting state and city standards this year, compared with 16 percent last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who has known his share of mischief, never met Ishmael Acevedo, but if he had, he might have identified with this particular third-grader. Ishmael plays the drums at home and the trumpet at church, but he said he had not been accepted into the music program at P.S. 96 because of his behavior. He tries to behave, Ishmael said, but his devilish streak keeps getting the better of him.</p>
        <p>''I want to be in it, but you have to deserve it,'' Ishmael explained. ''If there's too much kids, sometimes they choose a kid that be good.''</p>
