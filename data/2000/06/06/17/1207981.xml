        <p>The United States Civil Rights Commission today called on New York City to create a mechanism for the appointment of independent prosecutors to investigate serious accusations of police misconduct.</p>
        <p>The recommendation was contained in the panel's final report on the results of its investigation into the practices of the city's police force, which started after the fatal police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed street vendor, in 1999.</p>
        <p>The 248-page report released today is a more refined version of a draft that was circulated in April.  The draft had suggested that an independent mechanism was needed for such investigations but did not specifically suggest use of a prosecutor.</p>
        <p>The federal commission has no power to force the city to adopt its proposals, and the report left unspecified the details of how to appoint such prosecutors, or what powers they would have, suggesting that  would be up to the mayor and the City Council. The process might also require state legislative approval.</p>
        <p>The commission voted 6 to 2 today to adopt the report, with dissenting views from Carl A. Anderson and Russell G. Redenbaugh, who were named to the commission by Congressional Republicans in 1996.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani swiftly attacked the final report, saying in a statement that the commission had ''embarrassed itself by releasing a politicized report that bears no relation to reality.''</p>
        <p>The mayor did not specifically address any of the report's findings or recommendations, although his administration had already released a detailed rebuttal of the preliminary findings. The commission said the rebuttal, and the commission's response, would be included with the bound volume of the report.</p>
        <p>As expected, the commission endorsed the appointment of an independent board that would oversee the Police Department's disciplinary process and documented what it said was extensive racial profiling by police officers, including the Street Crime Unit, the aggressive plainclothes unit involved in the Diallo shooting.</p>
        <p>The report also recommended stepped-up efforts to recruit minorities, new efforts to improve police-community relations and abolition of the so-called 48-hour rule, a union contract provision that allows officers charged with a specific case of abuse to delay by two days being interviewed by superiors about it.</p>
        <p>But the most striking recommendation was that the city name ad hoc independent prosecutors to handle accusations of egregious misconduct, like a shooting of an unarmed civilian by police officers.</p>
        <p>According to the report, the independent counsel should come from a private law firm, rather than from a federal or state prosecutor's office. The panel said using an independent prosecutor would reassure the public that the accusations would be thoroughly investigated. Investigations are now handled by district attorneys and United States attorneys, who work closely with the Police Department on a day-to-day basis.</p>
        <p>The report did not say who should prosecute such cases in court after the investigation.</p>
        <p>The commission said its findings on racial profiling were the result of an examination of nearly 140,000 forms filled out by police officers after they stopped and questioned or frisked people on the street in 1998.</p>
        <p>The commission staff said it found that African-Americans were stopped ''far out of their proportion in any of the communities.'' Hispanic people were also stopped at a relatively high rate, but less so than black people. And whites and Asians were stopped at far below their representation in the population, the report concluded.</p>
        <p>For example, 51.6 percent of individuals who were stopped and frisked on Staten Island in 1998 were black and 15.5 percent were Hispanic. The report noted that the borough's population is only 9 percent black and 8.6 percent Hispanic.</p>
        <p>In making this assertion, the commission disputed the view of Mayor Giuliani and top police officials that the disparity merely reflected people who were identified as suspects by crime victims and witnesses.</p>
        <p>This claim, the report contended, is belied by the admission by the police that its divisions, including the Street Crime Unit, root out crime by making stops when no complaints have been lodged and no victims identified. ''They stop who they think they should stop,'' said Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the commission.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Redenbaugh disagreed that police were singling out minoritiesdeliberately .</p>
        <p>''The notion that the racial mix of who you stop ought to resemble the racial mix of the people in the neighborhood is a specious use of statistics,'' he said. ''I don't know if there is racial profiling or not.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, said the commission's recommendations ''don't have a technical legal bearing, but certainly have great moral influence'' on a standoff between the Council and Mr. Giuliani over the creation of a city-sponsored Independent Police Audit and Investigation Board.</p>
        <p>The Council adopted legislation a</p>
        <p>year ago creating such a body, but the mayor and the Manhattan district attorney took the Council to court, contending that it would intrude on their authority to control or investigate the police. The Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court is expected to rule in the case later this summer.</p>
