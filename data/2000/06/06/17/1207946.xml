        <p>The Security Council passed a resolution tonight demanding the immediate withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan forces from Congo and expressing outrage over their fighting earlier this month in the Congolese city Kisangani.</p>
        <p>But the resolution, unanimously adopted by the council's 15 members, dropped a four-month deadline set in an earlier draft after the United States and Britain pointed out that there had been no similar deadlines set in the cease-fire agreement reached by the warring parties in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, last July.</p>
        <p>Instead, the council called on all the warring factions to halt their hostilities throughout Congo and to meet their obligations under the cease-fire agreement.</p>
        <p>The resolution was approved in the presence of members of the Lusaka accord's political committee, who came to the United Nations for two days of talks with council members to try to find a way to stop the deteriorating situation in Congo, the former Zaire.</p>
        <p>The political committee's chairman, Amama Mbabazi of Uganda, said that the cease-fire agreement had generally held despite some violations. Mr. Mbabazi confirmed that Rwandan and Ugandan troops had stopped fighting over Kisangani and  had begun withdrawing.</p>
        <p>He also said that an exchange of prisoners had begun and that 181 prisoners had been freed so far, most of them from Rwanda, Zimbabwe  and Congo itself.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, a spokesman for the United Nations, Manoel Almeida e Silva, said the Rwandans and Ugandans had agreed to pull back a little more than 60 miles in a week's time.</p>
        <p>Still, the council members showed increasingly little patience with the lack of progress in ending the war that has devastated Congo.</p>
        <p>Britain's representative, Jeremy Greenstock, said the council was ''fed up to the back teeth'' by the parties who promised to take action and then failed to do it.</p>
        <p>And the United States representative, Richard C. Holbrooke, said, ''The parties have been responsible for the problem, and they cannot simply create a mess and expect the world to clean it up.''</p>
        <p>Today, Tunisia agreed to send some troops by June 30 to set up a headquarters for a United Nations peacekeeping presence in battered Kisangani. A diplomat said that the Tunisians would send about 100 soldiers.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the secretary general's special representative to Congo, Kamel Morjane, appealed for two companies of peacekeepers that are needed to fill the vacuum left by the departure of warring Rwandan and Ugandan forces, who have fought over Kisangani at a heavy cost of at least 160 civilians killed and 1,000 injured.</p>
        <p>The Congo war was also joined by Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia on the side of President Laurent Kabila of Congo, while Rwanda and Uganda initially came in to support rival rebel movements before they turned to fighting each other.</p>
