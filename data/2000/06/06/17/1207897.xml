        <p>Some ballets can be faked. ''Liebeslieder Walzer'' is not one of them. Without first-rate performers, the ballet is like too much chocolate cake. But the New York City Ballet presented a shining performance of this problematic ballet on Thursday night at the New York State Theater, with finely meshed dancers alert to every nuance.</p>
        <p>The two-part ballet, choreographed in 1960 to music for piano and voice, does not illustrate its songs about the agonies of love, delicious and otherwise. Instead, particularly in the first section, Balanchine suggests the manners of lovers both gallant and impetuous, experienced and innocent, in a pell-mell suite of waltzes for four couples confined to an elegant, intimate drawing room.</p>

        <p>Some ballets can be faked. ''Liebeslieder Walzer'' is not one of them. Without first-rate performers, the ballet is like too much chocolate cake. But the New York City Ballet presented a shining performance of this problematic ballet on Thursday night at the New York State Theater, with finely meshed dancers alert to every nuance.</p>
        <p>The two-part ballet, choreographed in 1960 to music for piano and voice, does not illustrate its songs about the agonies of love, delicious and otherwise. Instead, particularly in the first section, Balanchine suggests the manners of lovers both gallant and impetuous, experienced and innocent, in a pell-mell suite of waltzes for four couples confined to an elegant, intimate drawing room.</p>
        <p>The glass doors have blown open in the second section, and the lovers, the women now in less formal costumes, dart through as if blown by the wind. Balanchine said that real people populated the first act. In the second, their souls danced.</p>
        <p>An elegiac Kyra Nichols and Jock Soto were one of two central pairs of lovers. Wendy Whelan and Nilas Martins were the second, more unruly pair. All that they are is expressed in small details, like a slight bow of the head or curve of the arm or repeated pullings away. There is a hint of approaching death when Mr. Soto carries Ms. Nichols's body stretched parallel to the floor. But then, this is choreography filled with subtle, unexpected bits of odd partnering and staging that prefigure Balanchine's later anarchic choreographic urges.</p>
        <p>Youth laps at the two couples, personified by a mysterious Maria Kowroski, partnered by an elegantly restrained Philip Neal, and a lush Jenifer Ringer who danced with an extra-gallant Damian Woetzel. But all of this comes from the movement alone. There is no story here.</p>
        <p>The score was eloquently performed by the singers Elissa Johnston, Teri Medley, William Hite and Mark W. Uhlemann and the pianists Richard Moredock and Susan Walters.</p>
        <p>Nikolaj Hubbe and Yvonne Borree, in a role debut, came close to faking Balanchine's ''Donizetti Variations'' in bold, larger-than-life dancing that was enjoyable at first but a little wearing toward the end. Hugo Fiorato conducted.</p>
