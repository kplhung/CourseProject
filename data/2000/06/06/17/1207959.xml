        <p>For the baseball monks who gather with Zen-like devotion every Friday at Heckscher Field in Central Park to practice the art of softball, Chuck Knoblauch's inability to throw to first base sheds light on the demons that can pollute a player's mind.</p>
        <p>''It's the athlete's form of impotence,'' Jim Bitrosi, a 52-year-old advertising executive, said. ''You start thinking about it so much that your worse nightmare becomes true.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch's mental block is all the more puzzling, they said, because second base is not a position where a strong arm is generally needed. Indeed, throwing the ball from the right side of the infield to first base is one of the shortest throws in baseball and softball. The best defensive infielder usually plays shortstop.</p>
        <p>On any given day, most of the hard-core softball players at Heckscher Field can make some of the plays Knoblauch has blown in recent days, several players said.</p>
        <p>''It amazes me,'' said Morty Gilbert, who has been playing every Friday in the park since 1947. ''That you can have a second baseman like that. That the fundamentals aren't there. It seems so easy to adjust. You should be able to fix it with a competent coach.''</p>
        <p>Still, most of the players had compassion for Knoblauch, who came out of Thursday night's game against the Chicago White Sox after making three throwing errors in six innings. Many said they had gone through times when they could not hit or made an error from overthinking on a play. Some said they had even known players with problems like Knoblauch's.</p>
        <p>''We had a guy down here that played on Saturdays who had the same problem,'' Bitrosi said. ''He had been a great outfielder. Then one day, he couldn't throw. He threw it in the dirt each time.''</p>
        <p>Ted McGee, a 43-year-old financier, scooped up a ground ball at second base and zipped it smoothly over to the first baseman with a natural grace during a game yesterday. Coming off the field, McGee expressed sympathy for Knoblauch's problems.</p>
        <p>''It's not always an easy throw at second base,'' he said. ''You are often throwing across your body and you have to be careful because you have far more power in your arm than you need. If you lose your concentration, you're lost.</p>
        <p>''There has been too much pressure on him to be perfect,'' McGee said. ''It just gets to him. I feel bad for him.''</p>
        <p>Several people said that Knoblauch, a Texan who won a Gold Glove at second base for the Minnesota Twins before coming to New York in 1998, has had trouble adapting to the big-time stage that is Yankee Stadium. In New York, he started double-clutching the ball before throwing. Then the errors began piling up.</p>
        <p>''I think the pressure of being center stage has a lot to do with it,'' John Barth, a bearish 43-year-old actor who plays third base and has a cannon for an arm, said. ''He's got the talent. He's just got to shake off this head trip.''</p>
        <p>Gian-Paul Caccia, who is 14 and plays second base in the summer Federation League, said he noticed Knoblauch often played perfect defense when he had no time to think. It is only when the second baseman has plenty of time to throw out a runner that he chokes, the teenager said.</p>
        <p>''That's an easy play,'' said Caccia, smirking under his Yankee cap. ''It surprises me he can't make it.''</p>
        <p>The boy's father, Paul Caccia, a lifelong Yankee fan, said: ''You can see he's thinking too much. He's not reacting.''</p>
        <p>The players in Central Park theorized Knoblauch's problem might be rooted in personal problems. Or perhaps he just lacks self-confidence, some said.</p>
        <p>''He needs a girlfriend,'' said Eileen Hecker, 42, with a slow smile. (Knoblauch is divorced.) ''A stabilizing influence in his life.''</p>
        <p>John Castillo, a 27-year-old concierge who pitches, said, ''He needs to go to some sort of therapy and get his mind off whatever it's on.''</p>
        <p>But others said the cure was both simple and complicated. Knoblauch, they said, needs to empty his mind and just play.</p>
        <p>Yogi Berra once said when he was a rookie, ''I can't think and hit at the same time.'' Knoblauch should stop thinking, they said.</p>
        <p>''You make a play like that, you don't even think about it,'' said Pat Freni, a 57-year-old actor who made several good plays at second base yesterday. ''From when you're in Little League, you drill, drill, drill. Most of the time the play is over before you think about it.''</p>
        <p>Easier said than done. Try not to think about a throwing problem when every newspaper and sports radio station in town is talking about it and thousands of fans are watching every play you make, several players said.</p>
        <p>''It's easy to give the causes, but it's hard to give the cure,'' Jack Oppenheim, 68, said with a scowl. ''As for compassion, I don't feel any. I generally don't feel compassion for people making $6 million a year.''</p>
