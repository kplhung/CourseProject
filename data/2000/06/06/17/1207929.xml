        <p>Vuk Draskovic, a Serbian opposition leader, returned today to his home here, the scene of his close scrape with death on Thursday night, and accused President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia of ordering an assassination attempt.</p>
        <p>''It is certain that they did it,'' he said of Serbian secret services, ''and also it is certain that if there was a decision to kill me, the Serbian government would know about it.''</p>
        <p>A few days before the shooting attack that left him slightly wounded, he said, he had been warned by a contact in the Serbian government that an attempt on his life was being planned.</p>
        <p>The police said this evening that they had arrested suspects.</p>
        <p>''Police are in possession of the attack weapon and are holding the persons who carried it out, together with those who assisted them,'' said Vuk Boskovic, Montenegro's deputy interior minister. ''But we also know who ordered this crime.''</p>
        <p>The identities of the men will be disclosed on Saturday, he told Montenegrin state television in the capital, Podgorica, adding that the men had followed Mr. Draskovic from Serbia to carry out the attack.</p>
        <p>Mr. Draskovic, sitting in his vacation home here in Budva after his release from a hospital, looked tired and strained, with dressings on wounds to his right temple and left ear. ''I felt two bullets,'' he said. ''One made a hole in my ear, and the other one hit me when I was falling down.''</p>
        <p>One or more gunmen fired five or six bullets through the shutters into his living room, where he was sitting watching television, he said.</p>
        <p>As leader of the Serbian Renewal Party, Mr. Draskovic is the most important political opponent to President Milosevic, and as such represents a threat to his power. Still, the attack came at a low in Mr. Draskovic's fortunes, when his campaign to force Mr. Milosevic out of office by peaceful protest or elections appears to be faltering.</p>
        <p>The shooting in this small seaside resort has nevertheless caused grave concern among Montenegrin officials, who see it as another step in an effort by Belgrade to destabilize its smaller partner republic in the Yugoslav Federation. The shooting of Mr. Draskovic, who had sought the protection of the Montenegrin government, came just two weeks after the killing of Goran Zugic, a security adviser and close friend of Montenegro's president, Milo Djukanovic.</p>
        <p>Montenegro's interior minister, Vukasin Maras, sat beside Mr. Draskovic as he spoke with reporters, and denounced the attack as one not only on Mr. Draskovic but also on democracy and Montenegro, which has been trying to distance itself from the Belgrade government.</p>
        <p>''Those who think that by shooting at Vuk Draskovic they are achieving anything are making a mistake,'' Mr. Maras said. ''This will only give more strength to democracy in Montenegro.''</p>
        <p>The two shooting attacks, he said, showed that the police had to be more aware that the recent increase of violence in Serbia was now transferring itself to Montenegro.</p>
        <p>He was referring to a series of killings in Serbia. At least one high-level figure has been gunned down every month this year, including Yugoslavia's defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, and the paramilitary leader Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan.</p>
        <p>Belgrade has denied any involvement in the death of Mr. Zugic. Yugoslavia's information minister, Goran Matic, said it was the result of a plot orchestrated by the United States Central Intelligence Agency and an internal power struggle within Montenegro. Mr. Maras denied that scenario vigorously today.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Draskovic described the shooting, there were two bullet holes in the wall above the sofa where he sat, and several more holes marked the wall to the side.</p>
        <p>''I threw myself to the ground, rolled over and crawled up the steps,'' he said, showing how he had scrambled into the adjoining kitchen area and sought cover behind a pillar. There was a trail of blood on the floor to the door he used to escape to a neighbor's home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Draskovic said he had received a warning from a high-level contact in the Serbian government a few days ago that an ''order'' had gone out to kill him.</p>
        <p>''People in Moscow also knew about this,'' he added. He did not explain further, but last month he visited Moscow with other opposition politicians and met with Foreign Ministry officials.</p>
        <p>Despite the warnings, it appears that he had dispensed with the police security provided by the Montenegrin government during his few days in Budva. His personal bodyguards were not on hand because they had been arrested recently in Belgrade, charged with not having permission to carry weapons.</p>
        <p>His wife, Danica, who flew from their home in Belgrade to be with her husband, blamed Montenegrin authorities for failing to protect him. But Mr. Draskovic appeared to admit that he had allowed the lapse in security.</p>
        <p>''They were probably following me,'' he said of his attackers. ''They probably knew I do not like security. I was here working alone for two or three days, and they saw I was on my own and saw the opportunity for an attack.''</p>
        <p>''It is completely clear they will try to attack again, and will attack other people. This is the way they rule, without laws or constitution. In Serbia, it is a worse situation. It is like the postwar years of 1946 to 1947,'' he said, a reference to the  Communist purges under Tito.</p>
        <p>The pressure on Mr. Draskovic, 53, has intensified since last October, when four members of his political party, including his brother-in-law and his security chief, were killed in a collision between their car and a truck in Serbia. Mr. Draskovic insists that Mr. Milosevic was responsible.</p>
        <p>In May, the government took over the Belgrade television station run by the opposition-led city government, apparently another move against Mr. Draskovic and his party.</p>
