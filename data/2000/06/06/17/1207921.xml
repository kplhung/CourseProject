      <block class="full_text">
        <p>I WAS first diagnosed as a tumor,'' said Gov. Cecil H. Underwood, grinning at age 77 as he spoke of the many tricks of time, beginning with the suspicion of his mother, Della, that she was more likely ill than pregnant with him when she was 43.</p>
        <p>He has turned out a hearty offspring, challenging time at either extreme. He thrived to become the nation's youngest governor when he was first elected here in 1956 at the age of 34, and now he has returned as the nation's oldest governor after winning a second term 40 years later.</p>
        <p>It is no wonder that his crowded executive desk does not bother with framed mottoes about where the buck stops. ''Age is a matter of the mind,'' reads his desk marker. ''If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.''</p>
        <p>It is in this spirit that Mr. Underwood is running again this year. He is aiming to be chosen one more time by the voters -- naturally becoming the oldest re-elected governor -- not so much to defy time as to flatly ignore its accumulation.</p>
        <p>All partisan politics aside, Mr. Underwood may be presaging the geriatric advancements looming before American democracy, not to mention before the American workplace with its receding retirement age. This unpretentious hardscrabble state already has the distinction of bearing the oldest median age of any in the Union -- older than Florida with its legions of retirees. Job hunts often force its natives to emigrate, but an outsized number return home to settle after their careers. Their ballot choices regularly include Secretary of State Ken Hechler, an 85-year-old Democratic legend from the New Deal era who, like his Republican rival the governor, simply refuses to quit.</p>
        <p>''The first time here, my wife spent one night in the governor's mansion, then had to be rushed to the maternity ward,'' the governor happily recalled. The occasion was the birth of  the second of three children of Hovah Underwood, who is first lady once more, presiding over family holiday gatherings that now pack six grandchildren into their old executive homestead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Underwood will turn 78 two days before the next election. He registered to vote as soon as he was 21. Immediately afterward, he listed himself as a Republican candidate for the state's House of Delegates. He won, at the age of 22. He served 12 years in the Legislature, then won the governorship, prevailing as if age were beside the point when President Dwight D. Eisenhower's coattails swept the nation.</p>
        <p>IT'S very stimulating,'' Mr. Underwood said of the gilded Statehouse dome that greets him, same as the first time around, outside his bedroom window. ''It makes me want to go to work.''</p>
        <p>As he briskly moves about the executive chamber, he flashes past the darkly handsome ghost of himself in photos of 40 years ago, when his hair was thick and black, his ambition keen. Now his hair is thick and gray, his ambition keen.</p>
        <p>''Oh, it's much better the second time,'' he said of incumbency resumed. ''I had been a legislator and done some high school teaching, but I didn't have any real management experience the first time,'' said the governor, a graduate of Salem College with a master of arts degree from West Virginia University. ''Now I have a much broader understanding,'' he said of varied experience garnered in four decades of jobs between governorships.</p>
        <p>Mr. Underwood was a coal mining executive, a chemical company lobbyist, president of Bethany College and, dearest in his memory, a founding father of the Software Valley Foundation, an early business and government effort to create high-tech jobs that has taken root in the state.</p>
        <p>''When I ran again, I decided to focus on one issue I believed passionately in,'' said Mr. Underwood. The issue was fiber optics and its industrial promise for this splendidly hilly but remote state. ''But one morning my wife said: 'What are you talking about? Nobody's paying attention to you!' ''</p>
        <p>''So I started carrying this with me,'' he said, displaying a handy length of fiber-optic cable neatly peeled open, as if a modern mystery unveiled. ''I never made another public appearance without it,'' said the governor, shaking the futuristic training aid that became his swagger stick on the stump as he overcame early poll deficits.</p>
        <p>The governor does like to go back in time to the 35-acre farm in Joseph Mills where he grew up and where he now works the family fields any open weekend for his leisure. ''That's Silas, my father,'' he said, pointing behind the governor's chair to a photo of his father sweating in those fields at the age of 83, seven years before his death. ''He never got beyond the second grade.''</p>
        <p>''He voted the first time in 1896 and never missed an election,'' said the governor, reflecting on why he himself loved politics and refused  to retire from it. ''In contrast, my mother didn't believe in women's suffrage. But she called me one day in 1948 and said she was ready to vote,'' said the son, smiling at what time and politics could accomplish.</p>
        <p>''Of all the people who came by the farm, it was the political candidates who made the biggest impression on me,'' Governor Underwood said, remembering how they had always stopped to chat, as determined as salesmen. Just so, he began developing his candidate's touch as a young student when he got a job as a Fuller Brush peddler and had to go door to door. It was his first venture into that nice-to-see-you world of selling himself.</p>
        <p>''I was very shy, and this was a big help,'' the governor said of that far-from-last approach to the people. ''You just had to do it.''</p>
