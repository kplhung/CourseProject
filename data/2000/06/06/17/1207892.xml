        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a parent and a psychologist, I disagree with suggestions cited in your June 12 news article ''Brat Control on Easy Street.'' For example, when a child, rich or less affluent, requests a credit card, I would not advise polling other parents to see how many children actually have cards but rather assess the child's need and his knowledge and wisdom to use a credit card responsibly.</p>

        <p>I am not naive and do believe that there are differences when parenting well-off and less affluent children. But I hope that we do not teach that there is a separate value system for the rich and for the poor.</p>
