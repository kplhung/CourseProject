        <p>''What do you want us to say,'' President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia asked today after his fourth meeting in three days with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, ''that we're in love?''</p>
        <p>He was joking, of course. But there was no mistake that the summit meeting that ended today produced a vigorous rapprochement between Russia and Germany. Mr. Putin seemed entirely serious when he added, ''Germany is Russia's leading partner in Europe and the world.''</p>
        <p>The meeting led to agreements on German investments in Russia worth $1.7 billion, cautious German backing for a Russian plan to involve itself in the defense of Europe against missile attack, and the establishment of an apparently excellent rapport between Mr. Putin and Mr. Schroder.</p>
        <p>''They are two cool cookies, and they took to each other,'' said one Foreign Ministry official who attended several of the meetings. ''Theirs is not the old bear-hugging style'' of the former leaders, Boris N. Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl, ''but they see eye-to-eye and they get along.''</p>
        <p>This easy understanding stands in marked contrast to the sometimes awkward relationship between Mr. Schroder and President Clinton. But the official added: ''There is no equidistance in the German-Russian and German-American relationships. We are intimate with the United States; with Russia we are still trying to create a benign and stable power to the east.''</p>
        <p>Still, the sudden closeness of Berlin and Moscow is certain to cause some concern among Germany's European partners, always worried that Europe's central power may again seek its fortunes to the east.</p>
        <p>Michael Steiner, the chief diplomatic adviser to Mr. Schroder, insisted several times today that Germany was acting for Europe in seeking a ''strategic partnership'' with Mr. Putin's Russia.</p>
        <p>A senior American official said that the Clinton administration favored all efforts to draw Russia closer to the West, adding that he doubted that room existed for Russia to drive a wedge between the United States and its European allies.</p>
        <p>But in many respects, Germany appeared closer to Russia than to the United States on the question of missile defense. Mr. Schroder said today that a proposal by Mr. Putin to place Russia at the heart of a European missile defense system from the Atlantic to the Urals ''deserves thorough consideration and should be discussed both in the NATO-Russia Council and through bilateral relations.''</p>
        <p>The chancellor has been much cooler on the American proposal for a national missile defense system. He has warned that it must not be allowed to lead to a new arms race or undo existing agreements, including the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, which Mr. Clinton wants Russia to agree to amend.</p>
        <p>Russia is proposing the use of ''theater'' antimissile systems allowed under the 1972 treaty to shoot down short- and medium-range missiles that threaten Europe. The United States is deeply skeptical of both the feasibility and the desirability of the idea.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schroder showed little such skepticism. ''We agree on the necessity of political measures with regard to arms control in order to preserve the Antiballistic Missile Treaty,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In practice, German officials privately hope that Mr. Clinton will make no decision on the national missile defense system in the remaining months of the presidency. They say a decision would only put Mr. Putin in a corner and provoke what one called an ''unnecessary crisis with the alliance partners.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin, who speaks good German as a result of his five years in East Germany as a K.G.B. spy, said today that a ''united Europe'' should join a body set up by Russia and the United States to monitor missile launches around the world and provide an early warning system.</p>
        <p>Much of the talks were devoted to economic issues. Germany is Russia's largest creditor, and Mr. Putin is looking to German companies to invest heavily in his country and to provide access to industrial technology. He spent much of his time here -- described as a ''charm offensive'' by one official -- trying to convince executives that Russia could prove a reliable marketplace governed by the rule of law.</p>
        <p>The mission was partially successful. Wintershall, a German gas company, agreed to invest about $1 billion in a joint development of an offshore oilfield in the Arctic north with Russia's state-controlled gas company, Gazprom.</p>
        <p>Other investments worth more than $700 million were signed by three other German companies with Gazprom, and Mr. Schroder said about $500 million in new export credits should soon be available.</p>
        <p>But little progress was made on a debt-restructuring deal. Russia has been looking for some forgiveness of its large debt, but Germany has made clear this is impossible. ''We have told them, we are not going to treat them like Angola,'' said one official. ''Russia is a potentially rich country.''</p>
        <p>Differences over debt were not allowed to cloud the meeting. The two leaders strolled together through the Brandenburg Gate to symbolize the healing of history's wounds in a city battered by Soviet troops when they took Berlin in 1945 and then long divided as the eastern half fell into the former Soviet empire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schroder said that he and his wife, Doris, had accepted an invitation to spend Christmas with the Putins in a Kremlin that is to be equipped with a new hot line to the Berlin Chancellery.</p>
        <p>''We have agreed to breathe new life into our relationship,'' the chancellor added. ''That should not be negative for anyone -- not for our European partners and certainly not for our American friends. When relations are good with Russia, that is good for Europe.''</p>
