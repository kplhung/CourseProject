        <p>Correction of June 6 article about Ukraine's plan to close down Chernobyl nuclear plant; estimates of deaths from 1986 accident amended</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Because of an editing error, a front-page article on June 6 about Ukraine's announcement that it will close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by Dec. 15 referred incorrectly to the number of deaths and illnesses caused by the accident there in 1986. The Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a report that 31 people died in the first weeks after the accident. Other estimates of deaths ultimately caused by the accident range from dozens to tens of thousands; estimates of illnesses range from hundreds to tens of thousands. It has not been established that the accident caused untold thousands of deaths and illnesses.</p>
