        <p>The Senate voted unanimously today to approve a bill that catapults electronic commerce to a new level by allowing consumers and businesses to sign contracts online and know that their e-signature is just as binding as one in ink.</p>
        <p>The bill, which passed 87 to 0, has already been approved by the House and now goes to President Clinton, who said today that he would sign it into law.</p>
        <p>By giving electronic signatures the legal weight of paper signatures, the new law will offer consumers the chance to sign legally enforceable contracts for health insurance, bank loans and brokerage accounts over the Internet, around the clock and with no delay.</p>
        <p>Typically, consumers and businesses have to wait days or weeks for paper contracts to be written, mailed, signed and then returned.</p>
        <p>While many types of banking, insurance and brokerage accounts can now be opened on the Internet, they still require a signature on paper for final approval; that requirement will disappear. Until now, taxpayers who file their taxes electronically with the Internal Revenue Service have still needed to file a piece of paper bearing their signature.</p>
        <p>Financial institutions and insurance companies are expected to save billions of dollars a year by eliminating the cost of drawing up paperwork and then mailing it. Most records will be retained electronically, doing away with the need for giant warehouses of files.</p>
        <p>As written in the bill, consumers will be able to choose whether to do business online or on paper. Certain legal documents will still have to be produced on paper. For example, insurance and utility companies must still send cancellation and termination notices through the mail, wills cannot be executed over the Internet and products may not be recalled online. Also, mortgages must be foreclosed on paper.</p>
        <p>But while the legislation had overwhelming, bipartisan support on Capitol Hill -- only 4 members of the House opposed the bill while 426 approved -- some consumer advocates expressed concern that the law would lead to new types of fraud and identity theft.</p>
        <p>''We haven't sat down to figure out how to protect consumers,'' said Margot Saunders of the National Consumer Law Center. She said she worried that without a requirement for a paper signature, criminals could easily ''forge'' electronic signatures on everything from online purchases to credit card applications.</p>
        <p>''Consumers are left to prove a negative,'' she said. ''Everything changes with electronic signatures.''</p>
        <p>The law goes into effect Oct. 1, and consumers and businesses are expected to take advantage of the law almost immediately.</p>
        <p>Electronic-commerce companies, like E-loan and E*Trade, are all set to take advantage of the legislation, and some of the larger traditional banks like Citibank, which already do business online, are expected to make adjustments quickly. A Baltimore company, eOriginal, has said that it will offer completely electronic mortgages as soon as the law allows.</p>
        <p>''The bill revolutionizes the way consumers, industry and government conduct business over the Internet,'' said Senator Spencer Abraham, a Michigan Republican, who helped steer the bill through Congress. ''It is a tremendous cost-cutting tool because people and businesses can now enter contractual arrangements without having to drive across town, fly thousands of miles for a meeting, or mail reams of paper back and forth.''</p>
        <p>But in a nod to Democrats and to consumer rights' organizations, the bill also helps protect the millions of people who do not have access to the Internet or who worry about being defrauded in cyperspace.</p>
        <p>''This landmark legislation will ensure that consumer protections remain strong in the technology age,'' Mr. Clinton said today. ''It will help create new rules of the road for America's high-tech community.''</p>
        <p>The bill does not specify exactly what a digital signature will look like, allowing companies, and ultimately the free market to decide what kind of technology works the best.</p>
        <p>A signature could simply be strings of numeric code that are encrypted -- scrambled and unscrambled -- or it could involve more sophisticated devices, like scanners that read thumb prints or eyes.</p>
        <p>Because many consumers remain nervous about conducting these kinds of transactions online, it is likely many of companies will try to improve online security. Congress, too, has a role to play.</p>
        <p>''There needs to be a lot more focus on watchdogging against hackers,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, who helped draft the bill. ''A hacker today is sort of like the guy who goes around rattling all the windows and doors in a neighborhood, and there is a pretty good chance he will find one open.''</p>
        <p>Companies that develop this kind of security clearance online are already scrambling to offer their services. One Utah company, iLumin, plans to start offering a ''digital handshake system'' next week that would gather all the parties involved in a transaction in a cybersigning room to help them securely complete their negotiations.</p>
        <p>''My mantra through this all was consumer rights can't be virtual rights,'' Senator Wyden said. ''They have to exist in the real world.''</p>
        <p>The bill took several serious stumbles during negotiations between the House and the Senate versions, mostly over consumer protections.</p>
        <p>Companies said today that their paperwork savings as a result of the bill would be matched by new convenience for consumers.</p>
        <p>Tom Crocker, a lobbyist who represents Charles Schwab, the discount brokerage firm, said the bill would save Schwab and its customers time and money.</p>
        <p>''If you open a Schwab account now, most of it can be done online,'' he said. ''But you still have to print it out and do a wet signature on the account agreement.'' Under the law, the requirement of a paper signature is ended.</p>
        <p>The bill is also expected to be a boon for so-called business-to-business transactions. ''For instance, an automobile manufacturer will be able to have complete contract negotiations with parts suppliers online,'' said David Colton, a lobbyist for the Information Technology Association of America. ''There are huge cost savings associated with this, and the cost savings will ultimately be passed on to the consumers.''</p>
