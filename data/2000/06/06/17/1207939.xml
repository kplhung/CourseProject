        <p>The Eller Media Company may be the world's largest outdoor sign company, but not one of its 550,000 billboards and bus stop displays has ever been in Times Square.</p>
        <p>Until now. The company, a subsidiary of Clear Channel Communications, quietly struck a deal this spring worth an estimated $83 million to gain control of the sign network on a 52-story W hotel nearing completion at Broadway and 47th Street, according to executives who were briefed on the negotiations.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the deal, Eller Media has a long-term lease and an option to buy the signs, including the 300-foot-tall steel column that forms a giant signpost on the front of the hotel. The executives said that Eller was expected to buy the rights for  30,000 square feet of signs.</p>
        <p>Gary Barnett, an owner of Intell Management and Investment and the Broadway hotel, confirmed that he had leased the signs to Eller Media but would not discuss the details.</p>
        <p>Advertisers pay from $15,000 to more than $100,000 a month for billboards in Times Square.</p>
        <p>''It's not a platinum location, but anything in Times Square is good,'' said Jeffrey S. Katz, who owns Sherwood Outdoor, which controls many of the prime billboard spaces in Times Square. ''Over the past three years, there's been an explosion of signs in Times Square, which has become attractive to whole new categories of advertisers.''</p>
        <p>In April, Eller Media also formed a joint venture with Spectacolor Communications, the largest sign company active in Times Square, to put pulsating illuminated signs in European, South American and Asian cities.</p>
        <p>Intell Management earlier this month leased the 550-room hotel to Starwood Hotels and Resorts in a deal worth $175 million.</p>
