        <p>He called for the basketball again, motioning wildly to his teammates, flapping his sinewy arms. Reggie Miller, standing behind the arc, would not let the season expire for the Indiana Pacers.</p>
        <p>He squared, fired and flapped those arms some more. The range. The form. The rhythm. It was all there for Miller, whose shots splashed repeatedly into the nylon.</p>
        <p>All net. Almost even.</p>
        <p>The Conseco Fieldhouse roiled tonight with sound and passion, and Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers came tumbling down in Game 5 of the National Basketball Association finals, 120-87.</p>
        <p>Remove the Champagne from the coolers and pack up the championship hats and T-shirts already embroidered and stitched. The four-of-seven-game series is going to the Staples Center for Game 6 on Monday night in Los Angeles. Game 7, if necessary, is scheduled for Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''We absolutely, positively have nothing to lose,'' Miller said after scoring 25 points and hitting 4 of 6 3-pointers as Indiana dealt the Lakers their worst loss of the season. ''We don't care. We're coming out loose. There's no pressure on us. The pressure, from the get-go, was on them. They were supposed to sweep us, right?''</p>
        <p>Larry Bird went out with a victory in his last home game as Pacers coach, his team embodying the principles of their Hall of Fame player. Move the ball around the perimeter, help out on defense, rotate and refuse to give up layups or dunks. And shoot the lights out: 57.4 percent for the game, including 10 of 20 3-pointers.</p>
        <p>Miller's last of four 3-pointers came with 10 minutes 44 seconds remaining, a 26-foot shot from the right wing that made the arena rumble.</p>
        <p>That shot put Indiana ahead, 93-68, and sent Miller into the arms of his ecstatic teammates as Phil Jackson called timeout on the Lakers' sideline.</p>
        <p>Miller received all the help needed from them. Jalen Rose could not be stopped, scoring 20 first-half points as Indiana took the game to the Lakers early. He finished with 32.</p>
        <p>''I was talking about not letting them celebrate on our floor, and I was serious about that,'' Rose said. ''We did not want that to happen, especially after the season we had. It just wasn't going to happen.''</p>
        <p>Against the most accomplished defensive team in the league, Miller and Rose combined for 42 points and the Pacers shot 61 percent to take a 64-45 lead into halftime.</p>
        <p>The Lakers trimmed the margin to 13 midway through the third quarter, but another Pacer binge sent Indiana into the final period with an insurmountable 86-67 cushion.</p>
        <p>O'Neal (35 points and 11 rebounds) was the only Laker who had presence on the offensive end.</p>
        <p>After the indefatigable Bryant played 47 minutes and scored 8 of his 28 points in the Lakers' Game 4 overtime gem on Wednesday, he returned to earth tonight.</p>
        <p>Picking up his fifth foul with 1 minute 44 seconds remaining in the third quarter, he missed 16 of 20 shots and never found the rhythm that carried his team to victory after O'Neal had fouled out in overtime.</p>
        <p>''I didn't have a good game tonight, but whatever,'' Bryant said. ''We came here and did what he had to do which was get one. Now it's back to the Staples.''</p>
        <p>Only seven teams in N.B.A. history have recovered from a 3-1 deficit in a seven-game series to win it, and no team has ever accomplished the feat in the finals. Indiana cannot take much solace in the idea of having to beat a 67-victory team twice on its home court over the next four days to record its first N.B.A. title.</p>
        <p>''I still think they feel real good about themselves,'' Bird said. ''They've got two games at home and Shaq is still playing well. They've still got the upper hand.''</p>
        <p>But the Lakers have had their problems in close-out games, falling to 3-6 with the Game 5 loss. They lost their composure at several junctures, none more noticeable than when Derek Fisher rushed out to defend a Miller 3-pointer at the outset of the fourth quarter and was called for the foul.</p>
        <p>Arguing vehemently, he was hit with a technical. Miller made all three free throws, plus the technical. The Lakers had given up their second 4-point possession of the game.</p>
        <p>''It was a night that everything seemed out of the ordinary,'' said Fisher, one of the more composed Lakers. ''Those were four points that hurt us to start the fourth quarter.''</p>
        <p>The noise inside the arena was more deafening than even for Game 4, when Indiana seemed on the cusp of knotting the series at 2-2 before falling by 120-118 in overtime.</p>
        <p>Rik Smits, too, gave Indiana a monstrous lift. He parlayed his 24-point night in Game 4 with a 12-point performance in Game 5.</p>
        <p>The more he makes O'Neal respect his jump shot, the more energy the Lakers' 7-foot-1-inch, 330-pound center expends.</p>
        <p>The Lakers simply could not overcome a first-quarter onslaught from the Pacers. Making 15 of their first 20 shots and leading by 39-28 after the first quarter, Indiana looked intent on sending the series back to Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>After Rose dunked with 5:56 left in the second quarter, he scored on a reverse layup moments later to push the lead to 54-35.</p>
        <p>Jackson looked disgusted at Glen Rice, who looked like a cardboard cutout against Rose.</p>
        <p>Miller and Rose looked as cocksure as ever, shooting an unreal 8 of 10 from behind the 3-point line in the first half.</p>
        <p>Midway through the first quarter, Miller shot a 26-footer from the right wing, drawing a foul from Ron Harper and finishing a 4-point play with a free throw.</p>
        <p>Miller found himself alone again behind the line on the left baseline with time running down in the second quarter. He gave Brian Shaw a pump fake, set himself and released a picturesque shot with 44.1 seconds left as Shaw went crashing into the first row.</p>
        <p>All net. Almost even.</p>
