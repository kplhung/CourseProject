        <p>Martin R. Frankel, the fugitive American financier wanted on charges of looting more than $200 million from insurance companies, may soon be going back to the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frankel, arrested in Hamburg, Germany, last September after evading the F.B.I. for months, pleaded guilty today to German charges that he had evaded customs duties on about $5 million worth of diamonds he had brought to finance his flight from the United States.</p>
        <p>Today's plea removes the main obstacle to Mr. Frankel's extradition to the United States, where he faces more than 30 charges of fraud and money laundering as well as civil suits claiming damages of $600 million.</p>
        <p>The German authorities have already approved the United States Justice Department's request to extradite the financier, and they have indicated their willingness to carry out the extradition as soon as they have prosecuted Mr. Frankel on German charges.</p>
        <p>Though court officials declined to say exactly what the next step in the process would be, Mr. Frankel could be sent back as early as the end of next week. His German trial will be officially concluded next Wednesday, when all sides make their final statements.</p>
        <p>In addition to the charge of evading about $1 million worth of customs duties on the jewels he brought to Germany, Mr. Frankel was also indicted for carrying eight false passports and passing himself off in a hotel in Hamburg as a British citizen named Roger John Ellis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frankel, bearded and rumpled and wearing a heavy wool overcoat despite the spring weather, made it clear throughout his short trial that he wanted to stay in Germany as long as he could. He spoke English in the courtroom, and his remarks were translated into German by a court official.</p>
        <p>''The Germans respect human values,'' Mr. Frankel told reporters in the courtroom today. ''An extradition to America would be the same as an execution.''</p>
        <p>The guilty plea is the latest in a series of tactical reversals that have befuddled Mr. Frankel's own lawyers and angered the presiding judge. On Wednesday, Mr. Frankel balked at confirming his name and place of birth, and then refused to enter any plea or make any statement on his own behalf.</p>
        <p>But later, under pressure from Judge Horst Muntzger, Mr. Frankel announced that he wanted to call four witnesses -- three from the United States and one from Italy. The witnesses included Mona Kim and Cynthia Allison, two of his female associates who joined him for part of his time last year in Rome and Hamburg.</p>
        <p>German officials had worried that arranging for testimony from the witnesses -- something Mr. Frankel had said earlier would not be necessary -- would delay the trial for months. Hans-Gerd Meine, the prosecutor in charge of the case, warned Mr. Frankel that he might simply drop the charges and proceed immediately with the extradition.</p>
        <p>Before his abrupt flight from the United States last year, Mr. Frankel built up a convoluted empire by acquiring small insurance companies and then arranging to have himself put in charge of investing the companies' assets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frankel is accused of using a multitude of false names and using the insurance companies' money to pay for a lavish life. But the empire was collapsing around him and he disappeared last May. Firefighters in Greenwich, Conn., found his house on fire and discovered piles of documents stuffed into the fireplace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frankel led the F.B.I. in a global cat-and-mouse game, first hiding with Ms. Kim in Rome and then leaving for Hamburg just as F.B.I. agents were about to close in on him. It took several more months to track him down at a small but luxurious Hamburg hotel. German police arrested Mr. Frankel, who was accompanied by Ms. Allison, and he has been in prison awaiting trial and extradition ever since.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frankel's Germany lawyers say he has experienced enormous mood swings and has habitually changed his mind on legal strategy.</p>
        <p>Though he does not speak German, Mr. Frankel apparently made acquaintances in prison who recommended lawyers to represent him. Thomas Piplak, the first lawyer Mr. Frankel retained, said his client decided to add a second and then a third lawyer to his legal defense team.</p>
        <p>Mr. Piplak resigned as Mr. Frankel's attorney. Since then, he has been represented by Dirk Meinicke and Gunther Thiel.</p>
