        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Arthur Levine is off base in his June 11 Op-Ed article about campus diversity. The proliferation of ethnic and national clubs on campus is a plus, not a minus.</p>
        <p>Particularly on large campuses, it becomes important for students to join groups with common interests, whether the physics club, Hillel, the fencing club or the Filipino United Students Organization. Students need to feel part of something that is human in scale; they need to feel connected.  If they limited themselves to a single club, I might worry, but they do not.  An active student may well be part of half a dozen small-group activities.</p>

        <p>Particularly on large campuses, it becomes important for students to join groups with common interests, whether the physics club, Hillel, the fencing club or the Filipino United Students Organization. Students need to feel part of something that is human in scale; they need to feel connected.  If they limited themselves to a single club, I might worry, but they do not.  An active student may well be part of half a dozen small-group activities.</p>
        <p>Forming ethnic clubs does not mean succumbing to a culture of victimization and does not automatically suggest unrest. Judging from Stony Brook, the clubs are not primarily advocacy groups but rather families in which students feel at home.</p>
