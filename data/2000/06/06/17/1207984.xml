        <p>Two advocacy groups accused the Democratic and Republican parties today of breaking federal election law by using large soft-money contributions to pay for television commercials now showing across the country to promote the campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the nonpartisan groups, Common Cause and Democracy 21, which both advocate the overhaul of federal election laws, said they intended to file complaints next week with the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission challenging the legality of the advertisements that began showing in 15 states last weekend.</p>
        <p>''There is not even an effort to hide the fact that these are ads for the candidates paid for by soft money, and that is illegal,'' Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause and a former Massachusetts attorney general, said today.</p>
        <p>Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, said: ''We are charging both the presidential campaigns and the political parties with breaking the law with these ads. We are going to do everything we can to make sure that the law is enforced this time, and that these violations are not given a free ride again.''</p>
        <p>Four years ago, Common Cause challenged the legality of millions of dollars of similar advertising, charging that the commercials promoted specific candidates, not party issues. Although some lawyers and officials at the Justice Department and the election commission agreed, neither agency took action. Common Cause and Democracy 21 are hoping that the new complaints will be more persuasive.</p>
        <p>Federal election law prohibits the use of soft money, the unrestricted donations to the parties, to pay for political advertisements that promote the election of individual candidates.</p>
        <p>The Republican and Democratic parties defended the commercials, saying they advocated particular issues and did not violate the spirit or the letter of federal election law.</p>
        <p>''These ads are perfectly appropriate and legal,'' said Jenny Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. ''Our ads reflect a unified Democratic message, whether it is for the presidency, the Congress or key state and local races.''</p>
        <p>Cliff May, the spokesman of the Republican National Committee, said party lawyers concluded that the Republican issue advertisements were within the law. ''It's very clear that our ad is about Social Security,'' Mr. May said, ''and it is appropriate to have the leader of the party talking about that.''</p>
        <p>In the 1996 presidential campaign, the parties challenged each other's spending of millions of dollars on similar issue-advocacy advertisements. This year, without speaking to each other, the parties have settled on a set of unofficial rules of engagement: The candidates can appear in the issue-advocacy commercials, even speak in them, as long as each advertisement deals with a single issue.</p>
        <p>In the first flurry of party advertisements that began running last weekend, both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush appear, with Mr. Gore expressing his concern about the high cost of prescription drugs and Mr. Bush detailing his proposals for overhauling the Social Security system.</p>
        <p>This weekend, the Democrats are introducing a new, soft-money issue advertisement. Timed for Father's Day on Sunday, the advertisement features Mr. Gore promoting ''responsible fatherhood,'' and it includes some biographical information about Mr. Gore's relationship with his father.</p>
        <p>None of the commercials contain a specific electioneering message asking voters to support or oppose either presumptive presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>In 1996, similar issue advertisements also did not contain the words ''vote for'' or ''vote against'' the party standard-bearers. The absence of an electioneering message helped insulate the parties from the legal challenge from Common Cause.</p>
        <p>While some officials and lawyers at the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission believed the 1996 issue advertisements were thinly veiled candidate commercials that should not have been paid for with party funds, neither agency took action against the parties.</p>
        <p>Both the Democratic and Republican commercials are being paid for with a mix of hard money, the contributions to candidates and political parties that are limited under federal law, and soft money, the unlimited contributions made to political parties by corporations, unions and wealthy individuals.</p>
        <p>Campaign reform advocates said the issue advertisements now being shown amounted to commercials to promote Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore. As proof, they say the commercials are appearing in several important battleground states in the presidential race, including Florida, Missouri and Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>''It is a total fiction and a fraud to claim that these are political party issue advertisements,'' said Mr. Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21. ''Everyone involved knows they are presidential campaign ads being run for the direct purpose of influencing the presidential campaign, and therefore they cannot be financed with soft money.''</p>
        <p>Democratic and Republican strategists acknowledged in interviews this week that there was close coordination between the Bush and Gore campaigns and the political parties to produce the advertisements. In 1996, consultants for the Clinton-Gore campaign and the Dole-Kemp campaign also created their parties' issue advertisements.</p>
        <p>Mark Fabiani, Mr. Gore's communications director, said that the same media consultants were working for Mr. Gore and the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fabiani said that the vice president had not reviewed the final scripts of the first advertisements by the Democratic National Committee, but that the law would allow him to do so. ''This process has been carefully supervised by lawyers every step of the way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Republican National Committee hired a consultant, Alex Castellanos, to produce its advertisements. Mr. May, the committee spokesman, said Mr. Castellanos was not working on commercials for the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>Joseph Sandler, the Democratic National Committee's top lawyer, said coordination between the Gore campaign and the national party was allowed, even assumed, under recent court rulings and Federal Election Commission opinions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sandler said Democratic leaders in Congress also played ''a substantial role'' in shaping party advertisements and deciding where they should run. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, urged the creation of an advertisement on prescription drugs because the issue had already worked to the benefit of Democrats in primary campaigns this year. And Mr. Gephardt reviewed the advertisement the evening before it first went on the air last week, a spokesperson said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sandler said that Joe Andrew, the Democratic committee's national chairman, and Rob Engel, its executive director, as well as himself, reviewed the advertisements to be certain they did not expressly advocate the election of a candidate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sandler noted that the Clinton and Dole campaigns had filed complaints against each other because of the soft-money advertising in 1996, saying that each party's advertisements crossed the line into express advocacy of their candidate. This year, he said, lawyers for the Republicans and Democrats share a consensus on what is permissible.</p>
        <p>''There's a common legal interpretation that the standard is more or less no express advocacy and no references specifically pertaining to the election of any particular candidate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>An aide to the House Republican leadership said the national committee advertisements promoting Mr. Bush were not coordinated with Congressional leaders.</p>
        <p>''They wouldn't do anything that would hurt us,'' the official said, ''but the R.N.C. is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bush campaign right now. We have two separate races.''</p>
        <p>He said House Republican leaders were waging an intensive campaign in dozens of contested Congressional districts, while the national committee was overseeing the broad thematic campaign as well as the presidential contest.</p>
        <p>''We certainly know what they're doing,'' the official said. ''But the presidential race is so much more generic than the House races.''</p>
        <p>The Republican National Committee added a 30-second advertisement late this week to the 60-second spot that began running last weekend. Both are on Mr. Bush's plan to allow workers to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in private investment plans. The spots are running in the same 15 states where the Democratic prescription drug commercials are being shown.</p>
