        <p>New Jersey's Supreme Court temporarily set aside today a controversial lower court order for the parole of a 62-year-old inmate imprisoned since 1964 for killing two police officers in August 1963.</p>
        <p>Most immediately, the court's intervention blocked Monday's scheduled transfer of the inmate, Thomas Trantino, from a prison in Camden to a halfway house. The order also raised doubts about whether Mr. Trantino would be paroled by July 9, as a three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of Superior Court ordered last Friday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trantino's parole case has lingered for 20 years and has become the most heated, politically, in the state over those two decades. He has served longer than any other inmate in the state prison system and has been denied parole nine times since he first became eligible in 1980. Bitterness over the murders in Lodi of the officers, Sgt. Peter Voto, 40, and Officer Gary Tedesco, 22, remains deep-seated in many police departments in Bergen County. Most of the parole board's nine rejections of Mr. Trantino's applications have been preceded by protest rallies and candlelight vigils by police officers and county officials.</p>
        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman joined the criticism of last Friday's appeals court ruling and instructed the state's attorney general, John J. Farmer, to appeal the order to the State Supreme Court. In a statement that afternoon, Mr. Farmer said Mr. Trantino was not fit for parole because he was easily agitated, prone to violence and ''an unacceptable risk'' of committing another crime if freed.</p>
        <p>In papers filed earlier this week, Mr. Farmer asked the Supreme Court to temporarily set aside the appeals court order while it decided whether to grant his petition for an appeal of the order. The court unanimously ruled to grant that request today and scheduled a conference for July 5 on his petition.</p>
        <p>If the court then agrees to take the appeal, Mr. Trantino's release will most likely be delayed until the court decides whether to uphold or reverse it. If it refuses the appeal, the lower court ruling will stand and Mr. Trantino's freedom will become imminent unless the state appeals to the federal courts.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Farmer, Roger Shatzkin, said the attorney general was pleased with the court's order.</p>
        <p>Only three of the court's six sitting justices participated in today's ruling: Gary S. Stein, James H. Coleman Jr. and Virginia Long. The chief justice, Deborah Poritz, and another justice, Peter Verniero, both excused themselves from the case because they each had served as attorney general and opposed parole for Mr. Trantino. Justice Jaynee LaVecchia also excused herself because she once held a high-ranking position in the attorney general's office.</p>
        <p>Two judges from the appellate division, James M. Havey and David S. Baime, were temporarily assigned to the State Supreme Court for the Trantino case to give it the required quorum of five justices.</p>
