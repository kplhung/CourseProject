        <p>His hair is shot through with gray, his shoulders slope, and his ravine jowls have grown even deeper. But Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the battle-horse leader of the leftist opposition, is running for president for the third time. And despite the long odds, his determination seems unchanged.</p>
        <p>After months when Mr. Cardenas's stolid campaign seemed stalled, it has picked up steam. He is still well behind the two leaders. But because of the peculiar arithmetic of three-way politics here, Mr. Cardenas's surge has made him the pivotal player in the most contested presidential race in Mexican history.</p>
        <p>His gain mainly takes votes away from Vicente Fox Quesada, who is also battling to oust the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, from the presidency that it has controlled for seven decades. Because polls show that Mr. Fox is locked in a tie with the candidate of the governing party, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, Mr. Cardenas's pull on opposition voters could be just enough to cost Mr. Fox the election on July 2.</p>
        <p>And if Mr. Cardenas threw any support to Mr. Fox, he could tip the balloting the other way.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cardenas has disdained exercising his kingmaking powers. Instead, he is tenaciously riding his campaign bus from village to village, just as if he were on the cusp of victory, pitching his nationalist platform, opposing free trade and showering rebuke equally on his rivals.</p>
        <p>''You have seen me in the these lands for 40 years, always maintaining the same principles,'' Mr. Cardenas, 66, said before an eager crowd of farm workers in straw cowboy hats jammed into the quaint square of this rural city. ''I come to you exactly as I am, and I say exactly what I believe. I have never moved from my positions, because they represent the majority of the Mexican people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardenas made his first presidential run in 1988, after he had defected as a reformist rebel from the PRI and had generated a wildfire popular movement against its corruption. Many Mexicans say they believe that Mr. Cardenas really won that election but that PRI vote-rigging stole it from him in favor of Carlos Salinas de Gortari.</p>
        <p>In 1994, Mr. Cardenas placed a lackluster third. But three years later, he became the first opposition mayor of Mexico City, the post he left  for his current effort.</p>
        <p>In that first presidential race, Mr. Cardenas discovered his style as an anticandidate, and he has been running that since then. He distrusts television and hesitates, against advisers' pleas, to shape his campaign to feed its habits. Late at night, long after the newscasts, he holds teeming rallies. He is the opposite of telegenic, because his demeanor is formal and his natural expression is a furious frown. While Mr. Fox and Mr. Labastida rushed in early to fill the airwaves with trendy commercials, Mr. Cardenas moved only recently to produce modern-toned spots.</p>
        <p>''Political ads can't govern Mexico!'' he railed in one speech.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, it was television that gave him the recent lift. Mr. Cardenas was the moderator of a testy spontaneous encounter among himself, Mr. Fox and Mr. Labastida last month that was carried live nationwide for more than two hours. Mr. Cardenas won the argument, about whether to hold a formal televised debate, and cracked several jokes at Mr. Fox's expense, the first time that Mexicans could recall him being funny in public.</p>
        <p>When the three candidates finally met to debate on May 25, Mr. Cardenas gave another spirited performance that further helped him in the polls.</p>
        <p>A poll on June 5 by the newspaper Reforma showed Mr. Cardenas favored by 17 percent of voters, up from 12 percent in April. Several polls show Mr. Fox and Mr. Labastida tied around 40 percent.</p>
        <p>On the road, Mr. Cardenas defends leftist convictions that have done little to build his popularity. During three days of whistlestops in Michoacan, an agricultural state here in central Mexico, he called repeatedly for the release of jailed student strikers from the national university, saying they were political prisoners. But Mexicans, especially the working class, were outspoken in their disapproval of the strike, which paralyzed the most important public university for nine months.</p>
        <p>Although opinion surveys show that crime is a burning issue, Mr. Cardenas pledged to disband a new federal police force created to confront the problem, calling it a repressive unit.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Michoacan villagers by the thousands poured out to hear him and gathered in unscheduled rallies along his route, blocking the road to make him stop and visit. His followers are devoted less to his positions than to his persona, as the son of Lazaro Cardenas, a beloved president in the 1930's who was from Michoacan; as the standardbearer for the faltering welfare state; as a politician who has long battled the PRI; and as a man who does not cut his suit to fit political fashion.</p>
        <p>''He does what he says,'' said Rafaela Vazquez de Herrera, 60, a farm woman who prepared a beef stew for the candidate's lunch. ''He sees a poor person who is down and lifts him up.''</p>
        <p>In one town, the crowd lifted him on to a dappled gray walking horse and marched behind him through the streets. In another, fans jammed a square in the shadow of a mighty statue of his father to chant: ''Down with the system! Throw out the PRI!''</p>
        <p>In a passionate speech in Uruapan (pronounced oor-WAH-pan), Mr. Cardenas ruled out renouncing his candidacy at the last minute or making any other effort to help Mr. Fox, who represents the right-of-center National Action Party. After a volley of attacks he had aimed at Mr. Fox days earlier, his exasperated opponent accused Mr. Cardenas of ''betraying himself and many Mexicans who believed in him,'' and even disparaged Mr. Cardenas's mother, a breach of etiquette that signaled a permanent break between the men.</p>
        <p>The rift has caused a painful dilemma for Mexicans who are fed up with the PRI, especially those on the left. Mr. Fox's strategists have appealed for their support, arguing that a vote for Mr. Cardenas is tantamount to a vote for the PRI.</p>
        <p>Some experts contend that Mr. Cardenas does not grasp the damage that he is causing for the opposition's larger anti-PRI cause.</p>
        <p>''He felt the experience of winning in 1988, and it traumatized him,'' said a political expert, Jose Antonio Crespo. ''He is stuck. He has not been able to measure the enormous changes in Mexico since then.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cardenas said he has no fear that history will judge him harshly as having deprived the opposition of its best chance to unseat the world's longest-governing party. His first concern, he insisted, is to build the base of his own Democratic Revolutionary Party. And although Mr. Fox is conducting his campaign as an assault on the PRI, Mr. Cardenas does not say Mr. Fox is really different from the governing party.</p>
        <p>''If you tell me that Vicente Fox is the opposition,'' Mr. Cardenas said in an interview, ''I will say you are wrong.''</p>
        <p>Along the trail, some voters said they admired Mr. Cardenas's steadfastness, but felt that his moment was past.</p>
        <p>''We want a change of power,'' said Dr. Rodolfo Robledo Montes, a physician who was curious to see Mr. Cardenas, but thought that he would vote for Mr. Fox. ''I admire his principles. But I feel that time has left him behind.'' Mr. Cardenas maintains that he is timeless. ''Mexico changes,'' he said. ''Campaigns change. But I don't change. I am always the same.''</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>Accord on Monitoring Vote</p>
        <p>(By The New York Times), MEXICO CITY, June 16 -- The two leading opposition candidates for the presidency, Vicente Fox Quesada and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, joined today in a pact to defend the balloting on July 2 against fraud. They agreed that their parties would work together to monitor the voting and report vote buying.</p>
