        <p>The propaganda war in the DMZ fell silent today for the first time in at least 50 years, and President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea could be heard declaring that ''the danger of war on the Korean peninsula has disappeared.''</p>
        <p>Just a day after talks between North and South Korea ended in Pyongyang, the South ordered an end to anti-Communist broadcasts that its military had transmitted for decades from giant loudspeakers along the heavily fortified border with North Korea.</p>
        <p>The order was issued in response to North Korea's decision on Tuesday to switch off its loudspeakers, which had blared anti-South insults over the demilitarized zone through the years.</p>
        <p>The end to the broadcasts was one of several steps the two nations have taken to signal that the half-century of hostilities on the divided peninsula are indeed coming to an end. They were also hoping to dispel critics who had questioned whether a broad agreement reached at the recent summit meeting between President Kim and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il, would actually lead to specific actions toward peace.</p>
        <p>For its part today, North Korea allowed a South Korean fishing boat that had strayed across its heavily patrolled sea border to sail back to its home port without incident.</p>
        <p>This was in marked contrast to the situation a year ago this week, when North and South Korean naval vessels exchanged gunfire over fishing rights in the same area. One North Korean warship sank, and about 30 Communist sailors were believed to have died.</p>
        <p>Also today, South Korea's Defense Ministry announced that it would reconsider a $40 million program to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War on June 25, 1950.</p>
        <p>The agency had planned numerous parades, ceremonies, battle re-enactments and other events that were to be attended by thousands of veterans and dignitaries, many from the United States.</p>
        <p>''We are looking for ways to commemorate the anniversary in compliance with the spirit of the agreement reached at the summit,'' a ministry spokesman, Yoon Il Young, said.</p>
        <p>And Kim Dae Jung told his cabinet today that Kim Jong Il had agreed to his suggestion to invite Pope John Paul II to visit North Korea.</p>
        <p>''Chairman Kim asked the pope's age and told me to tell the pope to come to North Korea,'' President Kim said while meeting with the cabinet, according to his aides.</p>
        <p>The South Korean president, who is a Roman Catholic and visited the pope in March, said he had instructed the Foreign Ministry to convey the wishes of his North Korean counterpart to the Vatican.</p>
        <p>It was while he was meeting with the cabinet that President Kim said that the danger of war had passed. ''The summit opened a new chapter for national unification,'' he said.</p>
        <p>North Korea is widely considered to be the world's most totalitarian society, and organized religion there has long been suppressed in favor of leader-worship, first for the country's founder, Kim Il Sung, and now for his son, Kim Jong Il. Of a population of 22 million, 4,000 are believed to be Catholics.</p>
        <p>In addition to today's actions, Kim Dae Jung instructed his cabinet to carry out a wide variety of reconciliation measures growing out of the three-day talks, which concluded in an agreement calling for the two Koreas to pursue peace, economic and other exchanges, including family visits.</p>
        <p>The South Korean president said that he hoped the efforts would coax North Korea out of its self-imposed isolation and help rebuild its faltering economy.</p>
        <p>South Korean officials said they hoped that the two heads of state could meet again in Seoul on or around the Aug. 15 holiday that celebrates the anniversary of Korea's liberation from nearly 40 years of Japanese colonial rule.</p>
        <p>The South Korean president also said that he had a 20-minute telephone conversation with President Clinton today in which he informed the American leader that he raised North Korea's nuclear and missile programs in talks with Kim Jong Il.</p>
        <p>''I told him that the missile and nuclear problems do not help regional and world peace as well as inter-Korean cooperation,'' aides to the Korean president quoted him as having told Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>The presence of 37,000 American troops in South Korea was also discussed, Kim Dae Jung told Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>The South Korean leader's position is that the United States military presence is needed for regional security even after the unification of the Korean peninsula. The aides said that Mr. Clinton thanked Kim Dae Jung for raising the North's nuclear and missile issues, saying that ''those issues are important for all of us.''</p>
