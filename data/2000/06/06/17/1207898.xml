        <p>The winners of the International Team Trials, which ended Monday in Memphis, were four players from the Chicago area, George Jacobs, Ralph Katz, Howard Weinstein and Steve Garner, together with two from the East Coast, David Berkowitz and Larry Cohen.</p>
        <p>In the diagramed deal, reported in this column Thursday, Weinstein defeated four hearts with an inspired lead of the club four. In the replay, the auction shown in the diagram was less revealing. West did not know, as Weinstein had, that North was seriously interested in slam. He made a normal diamond lead, and Jacobs as South played low from dummy.</p>
        <p>When East won, he would probably have defeated the contract had he  shifted to a spade. Instead he returned a diamond, and the contract was still in the balance.</p>
        <p>South drew trumps ending in dummy, with West throwing the spade seven. A diamond discard would perhaps have been better, but would not have saved him in the ending against accurate play.</p>
        <p>South cashed the club ace, planning to continue with a low club and guarantee the contract with any likely club split. The 5-0 division was a nasty blow, but he still led a low club from dummy.</p>
        <p>West won with the ten and returned the queen, leading to this ending after dummy's king won:</p>
        <p>[Diagram]</p>
        <p>Needing four of the last five tricks, Jacobs found a brilliant way to survive. He led the spade queen from dummy and ducked it around to West's king.</p>
        <p>There was no counter to this. West chose to lead his remaining diamond, which was ruffed in dummy. South led the spade ten for a finesse, pinning West's nine.</p>
        <p>If West had had the spade seven in the ending instead of a diamond, South would still have prevailed. After a spade return from West, the spade eight in the South hand could have been established.</p>
        <p>This was a gain of 12 imps for the Jacobs team en route to victory.</p>
        <p>They defeated the two strongest teams in the country in the semifinal and final. They will have a good chance to win a world title when they represent the United States in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in August.</p>
