        <p>The legend was that if you touched Robert Johnson you could feel the talent running through him, like heat, put there by the devil on a dark Delta crossroad in exchange for his soul.

        <p>The legend was that if you touched Robert Johnson you could feel the talent running through him, like heat, put there by the devil on a dark Delta crossroad in exchange for his soul. It is why Claud Johnson's grandparents would not let him out of the house that day in 1937 when Robert Johnson, his father, strolled into the yard.</p>
        <p>Robert Johnson, the famous, almost mythical blues man, had come to Lincoln County, Miss., to see Virgie Jane Smith, a young woman he had been intimate with, and a son he had never seen.</p>
        <p>''We were living in my granddaddy's and grandmama's house,'' Claud Johnson said. ''They were religious people, and they thought that the blues was the devil's music. People back then believed that.</p>
        <p>''They told my daddy they didn't want no part of him. They said he was working for the devil, and they wouldn't even let me go out and touch him. I stood in the door, and he stood on the ground, and that is as close as I ever got to him. Finally, he said, 'Well, I might as well go on.' He wandered off, and I never saw him again.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson has always wondered what would have happened if he had run across that porch to him, so that everyone would know he was Robert Johnson's son.</p>
        <p>Now, 63 years later, the Mississippi Supreme Court has ruled that Mr. Johnson, a retired gravel truck driver who lives in Crystal Springs, Miss., truly is the flesh-and-blood of a man so mythologized that many people do not know where the legend ends and the truth begins.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, after years of legal battles between Mr. Johnson and other, more distant relatives, the State Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Johnson was the son and sole heir of one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, and that he could rightfully receive more than $1 million dollars in music royalties amassed in recent years.</p>
        <p>''All my life I have known that he was my father,'' said Mr. Johnson, whose mother had a romantic fling with Robert Johnson in 1931, resulting in his birth.</p>
        <p>''I knew he was a famous man, but he didn't live to see his fame,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said he would never forget the sight of Robert Johnson, still a young man at 26 or 27, ''clean-cut,'' and sharply dressed as he walked into the yard.</p>
        <p>''But I was fortunate,'' Claud Johnson said. ''At least I got to see him.''</p>
        <p>In Mississippi, and in the broader world of music, Robert Johnson's name evokes rich, dark and mysterious images of the Delta that gave birth to his music.</p>
        <p>Every guitar picker knows the story of how Robert Johnson, just a raggedy farm worker who wanted badly to play the blues on his old guitar, sold his soul to Satan at that dark crossroads in Mississippi, how the devil put fire in his fingers and brimstone in his throat, fusing him with talent and promising him fame.</p>
        <p>But everyone, at least most folks in Mississippi, knows that the devil is a liar. Some people here blame the devil for Robert Johnson's demise, saying he tricked him and gave him just enough fame to kill him.</p>
        <p>Johnson, who wrote such blues standards as ''Rambling on My Mind,'' ''Crossroads Blues'' and ''Me and the Devil Blues,'' produced 41 records and his haunting, plaintive vocals and guitar work influenced countless blues and rock 'n' roll musicians like the Grateful Dead and the Rolling Stones. But he died penniless at age 27 in 1938 in Greenwood. He left no will because he had nothing to pass on except his music, which few people seemed interested in at the time.</p>
        <p>Peter Guralnik, the author of ''Searching for Robert Johnson,'' (Dutton Books, 1989), said that some called Johnson the father of blues.</p>
        <p>''What is so remarkable,'' Mr. Guralnik said, ''is not that he struck such an original chord, but what was new was the way each song was focused in a way a lot of blues songs aren't.''</p>
        <p>He was so unappreciated at the time of his death that no one is even really sure where Johnson is buried.</p>
        <p>Justice Mike Mills of the Supreme Court said in his ruling that it was impossible to get DNA evidence from a body that did not exist.</p>
        <p>''As far as we know, Johnson is buried 'down by the highwayside, so his old evil spirit can get a Greyhound bus and ride,' '' the justice wrote in the ruling, quoting one of Johnson's songs, ''Me and the Devil Blues.''</p>
        <p>The lack of a body forced Claud Johnson's lawyers to turn to other means to prove his connection to his father, including, as it turned out, a witness to his conception.</p>
        <p>Claud Johnson's mother, the late Virgie Jane Smith Cain, swore in a 1992 deposition that Robert Johnson had fathered her child.</p>
        <p>That might not have carried much weight in court, but Mrs. Cain's testimony had collaboration.</p>
        <p>A childhood friend, Eula Mae Williams, testified in a 1998 trial that she watched Robert Johnson and her friend have sex in 1931.</p>
        <p>Claud was born nine months later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson grew up hearing his mother say that he was the son of the famous blues man, and that made him proud, though he said he never thought that his father's legend, ''would amount to anything in money.''</p>
        <p>When his mother married a man named Marshall Cain, she had insisted that he take Cain as his last name. But as soon as he was grown, he legally changed his name to Johnson. ''I got it on my first Social Security card,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One of his lawyers, Jeffrey Ellis of Crystal Springs, said that no one could say that Claud Johnson started claiming his kinship only after Robert Johnson's recordings became valuable in the 1980's. ''Mr. Claud had been claiming this all his life,'' Mr. Ellis said.</p>
        <p>Other relatives questioned the validity of his blood ties to Mr. Johnson. Annye C. Anderson of Amherst, Mass., and Robert M. Harris of Annapolis, Md., are the half-sister and grandson of Carrie Harris Thompson, who was Robert Johnson's half-sister.</p>
        <p>Ms. Thompson died in 1983 and left the rights to Robert Johnson's music to them.</p>
        <p>In the early 1990's, Mr. Johnson filed suit in Mississippi seeking to have himself declared the legal heir and the one entitled to $1.2 million in royalties from the blues artist's recordings.</p>
        <p>A trial court ruled in favor of Mr. Johnson in 1998, but that ruling was appealed, leading to the decision by the State Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>James Craig, the lawyer representing the other relatives, said today that he was considering a motion for the court to reconsider the ruling. But he said he did not expect extensive appeals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Craig also disputed the evidence presented to show Mr. Johnson's parentage. Mr. Johnson's birth certificate lists Robert Johnson as the father, Mr. Craig said, but Mr. Johnson himself never signed the certificate. Under Mississippi law, birth certificates for children born out of wedlock must have the father's signature to be valid proof of paternity, he said.</p>
