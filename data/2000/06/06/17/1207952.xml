        <p>Senate Unanimously Passes Electronic-Signature Bill  The Senate voted unanimously to approve a bill that catapults electronic commerce to a new level by allowing consumers and businesses to sign contracts online and know that their e-signature is just as binding as one in ink. The bill has been passed by the House and now goes to President Clinton, who said that he would sign it into law.</p>
        <p>By giving electronic signatures the legal weight of paper signatures, the law would offer consumers the chance to sign legally enforceable contracts for health insurance, bank loans and brokerage accounts over the Internet. But certain legal documents will still have to be produced on paper. For example, insurance and utility companies must send cancellation and termination notices through the mail, wills cannot be executed over the Internet and products may not be recalled online.

        <p>Bank Stocks Send Dow Down 2.5%  Blue-chip stocks fell, led by financial issues, as two banks warned that higher interest rates would reduce profits. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 265.52 points, or 2.5 percent, to 10,449.30. The Nasdaq composite index gained 14.82 points, to 3,860.54, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index lost 14.27 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 1,464.46. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Another Profit Warning From Xerox  Facing strong competition in its highest-margin product lines, problems collecting accounts in Mexico and upheaval in its sales force, Xerox warned that its second-quarter earnings would be as much as 12 cents below expectations of 42 cents a share. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Microsoft Confronts Rivals' Tactics  Microsoft accused its rivals of masterminding an attempt to buy the trash generated by a Microsoft-backed lobbying organization, apparently hoping it would yield valuable information about the company. The accusation came as the Justice Department filed still another brief in the antitrust case against the company. It countered a Microsoft brief filed Thursday that tried to undermine the government's effort to send the company's appeal in the case directly to the Supreme Court. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Net Income Climbs 15% at Lehman  Despite a sharp slowdown in domestic stock and bond markets, Lehman Brothers Holdings reported that its profits rose 15 percent, to $378 million, or $2.78 a diluted share, up from $330 million, or $2.09 a share. [C4.]</p>
        <p>China Unicom Raises $4.9 Billion  Capitalizing on the recent popularity of telecommunications stocks and the enduring appeal of the world's most populous country, China Unicom, China's second-largest telephone carrier, raised $4.92 billion in the largest initial public offering in Asia outside Japan. [C2.]</p>
        <p>T.W.A. and AirTran Holding Talks  Shares of Trans World Airlines and AirTran Holdings rose on reports that they were holding merger discussions. But people close to the talks said that there was little chance of a deal. Shares of T.W.A. rose 31.25 cents, to $2.875, while AirTran shares jumped 25 cents, to $4.5625. T.W.A. would not confirm that it was in negotiations. [C14.]</p>
        <p>CDC Asset in $700 Million Deal  The investment management company Nvest agreed to be acquired by CDC Asset Management for $40 a share, or $700 million. CDC will also assume $1.5 billion of debt. CDC is the investment management arm of Caisse des Depots of France. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Dresdner Renews Efforts to Merge  Two months after it broke off merger talks with a larger rival, Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank has held preliminary discussions with Commerzbank, Germany's fourth-largest private bank. Both banks are under pressure to consolidate and reduce costs. [C2.]</p>
