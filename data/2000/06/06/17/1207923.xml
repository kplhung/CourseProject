        <p>MICHAEL MOORE made a name for himself pointing cameras at cruel corporate executives and other enemies of the people. He stalked the chairman of General Motors, sent people in Puritan costumes to Ken Starr's home and set up a Web site with a camera trained on a window of Lucianne Goldberg's apartment.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Moore does not appreciate being bothered himself, as Alan Edelstein discovered. After he was fired by Mr. Moore, Mr. Edelstein tried borrowing the technique Mr. Moore had applied to G.M.'s Roger Smith in the film ''Roger &amp; Me'': showing up uninvited with a camera and trying to get an answer from a boss who has decided to downsize.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore responded by filing a complaint with the New York police accusing Mr. Edelstein of aggravated harassment, menacing and criminal trespassing. As a result, Mr. Edelstein was arrested in March and spent nine hours in a cell at the Midtown North police station. The district attorney's office later dropped the case. Now Mr. Edelstein is suing Mr. Moore, alleging malicious prosecution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edelstein, who is 39 and lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, was hired in 1998 as a producer on ''The Awful Truth,'' Mr. Moore's show on the Bravo network. He was fired by a subordinate of Mr. Moore's after seven weeks.</p>
        <p>''I was told that there was a budget crunch,'' he said, ''but I don't think that was true. I later learned there were questions about my competence, which no one had ever raised when I was there. So I was angry at the way I was dealt with.''</p>
        <p>He had another reason for pursuing Mr. Moore with a camera. Mr. Edelstein, who was nominated for an Academy Award in 1985 for a documentary about a musician, was making a documentary incorporating scenes from his own life. ''I thought footage with Michael explaining why I'd been fired would be useful for my own documentary,'' he said.</p>
        <p>During a speech by Mr. Moore at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Mr. Edelstein stood up with a camera and a bullhorn, a tool used by Mr. Moore outside the offices of executives. Mr. Edelstein demanded to know why he had been fired but didn't get an answer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edelstein twice showed up with his camera at the office of Mr. Moore's production company on West 57th Street near 11th Avenue. He filmed some employees but didn't manage to reach Mr. Moore. Later, he took his camera for a few more unsuccessful attempts to engage Mr. Moore at public events outside the office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore says he complained to the police because he thought Mr. Edelstein had become a stalker who was a threat to Mr. Moore's family as well as his employees.</p>
        <p>''If all he was doing was making his little film about me, I wouldn't have cared,'' Mr. Moore said. ''But other people were at risk. This is a disgruntled employee who is a bit off his rocker. Everyone in the office felt there was considerable risk. The women in the office felt frightened for their own safety. Ask them. They'll tell you.''</p>
        <p>I ASKED several women, including one recommended by Mr. Moore, and none sounded scared. They said they found Mr. Edelstein a bit obsessive but otherwise mild-mannered and harmless.</p>
        <p>''No one was remotely in fear of Alan in any shape or form,'' said Kyra Vogt, who was the office manager at the time Mr. Edelstein showed up with the camera. ''Most of us thought the situation was comical. The only person who was paranoid was Michael. He couldn't deal with having someone follow him around.''</p>
        <p>When I asked Mr. Moore why the district attorney hadn't prosecuted someone who was supposedly so dangerous, Mr. Moore said he didn't know. ''I wanted to pursue the case,'' he said, and he urged me to find out what had stopped justice from being done.</p>
        <p>I did, and again Mr. Moore's version of reality did not jibe with the rest of the world's. A transcript from a hearing in Manhattan Criminal Court on Nov. 1, 1999, shows that Judge Ellen M. Coin dismissed the case after being informed by Assistant District Attorney Erin Koen that ''the complaining witness does not want to proceed with the case.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore dismissed as ''frivolous'' Mr. Edelstein's lawsuit in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Edelstein said he was looking forward to his day in court.</p>
        <p>''I want Michael Moore to be accountable for his false charges,'' Mr. Edelstein said. ''He always grandstands about the First Amendment and artistic freedom, but when I attempted to do essentially what he does, he had me arrested and put in a cell for a day.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 20, 2000, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, the Big City column on Saturday about Alan Edelstein, a former producer on Michael Moore's television program ''The Awful Truth,'' misstated the date that Mr. Edelstein was charged with harassing his former employer by following him with a video camera. Mr. Edelstein, who recently sued Mr. Moore for malicious prosecution, was arrested in March of 1999, not this year. (The case was later dismissed.)</p>
