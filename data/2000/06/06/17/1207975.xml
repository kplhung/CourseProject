        <p>To get to the thickly forested preserve where Joan Byron-Marasek keeps 24 tigers, you have to go past the Six Flags Outlet Mall just off Interstate 195, and through a busy intersection with three gas stations and a Methodist church. If you come across a new development of large, expensive homes, you've gone a bit too far.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Byron-Marasek and her husband, Jan Marasek, moved to this enclave in South Jersey 24 years ago and began acquiring tigers, they were practically out in the wilderness.</p>
        <p>But now the modern world is pressing in on the 15-acre domain of Ms. Byron-Marasek, better known as the Tiger Lady. And with development has come a host of other forces knocking on her 25-foot-high iron gate: angry neighbors, who have filed lawsuits saying her preserve is incompatible with their neighborhood; the town and the Ocean County Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, who have filed complaints in municipal court over the 35 dogs she keeps in the compound; and the State Department of Environmental Protection, which is nearing a showdown in its yearlong effort to close her Tigers Only Preservation Society.</p>
        <p>State officials, citing poor conditions at the compound, have given her until the end of the month to present a plan detailing how she will remove the tigers from her property.</p>
        <p>But the Tiger Lady has dug in her heels. Not only has she refused to plan for the tigers' removal, but the normally reclusive couple have also begun a public relations effort to appeal to other animal lovers or to anyone who agrees that she is the victim of government intrusion.</p>
        <p>''People are saying, 'If they can do this to her, they'll do this to all of us,' '' she said of those who have come to her support, including the owner of the fence company who donated the chain-link barrier around a new part of the complex.</p>
        <p>She has even started a Web site to solicit donations and gather names on a petition asking Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to allow the preserve to stay open.</p>
        <p>''Losing is not an option,'' Ms. Byron-Marasek said today, while showing visitors through her compound. ''I have to stay positive. This is my life. I'll fight to keep them. I mean fight legally, with appeals, whatever it takes to legally fight them.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Byron-Marasek does not allow many people into her small world, and she does not leave it very often, either. She and her husband work full time tending to the tigers, who live in pens surrounded by 18-foot-high chain-link fencing, connected to each other and to 40-foot trailers where the tigers can go to escape the heat or cold.</p>
        <p>The couple are the only ones, save for occasional volunteers, who care for the tigers. They spend much of their time inside the cages with the animals.</p>
        <p>''I'm not afraid of them,'' said Ms. Byron-Marasek, a small-boned woman who, at 5 feet 2 inches tall, is dwarfed by the 400- to 600-pound tigers, which stand at the fence on their hind legs when she approaches and rub their noses to hers. ''I understand them. But I, too, can get tough.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Byron-Marasek is stingy with details about her personal life. She will not reveal her age or where she was born. She will say that she worked as a circus trapeze artist as a teenager, and that she grew close to some of the animal trainers. She was an actress on Broadway, performing in Tom Stoppard's  ''Jumpers,'' in which she swung from a chandelier using her teeth and legs.</p>
        <p>In 1976, she left the theater, and she and her husband bought the property in Jackson Township. She bought five 8-week-old tigers after obtaining a state permit.</p>
        <p>Ms. Byron-Marasek ended up with as many tigers as she has in part because she allows the animals to inbreed, which some animal rights groups say can produce unhealthy animals. She says she keeps the tigers to help preserve the species, and because she loves them. The state says her permit allows her to keep such animals only if she exhibits them, but she cannot present evidence that she does.</p>
        <p>Her troubles began in January 1999, when the police killed a tiger wandering in the area. State officials say the tiger was Ms. Byron-Marasek's, but she denies that.</p>
        <p>Since then, state inspectors have made more frequent unannounced visits, and Ms. Byron-Marasek has made improvements to the compound, like a concrete border to keep the tigers from digging their way out. She and her lawyer, Valter Must, say the state keeps changing the rules. But state officials say the rules are clear-cut and intended to protect the tigers and the public.</p>
        <p>For example, the state wants her to provide up-to-date records on how many animals she has, and their medical histories. In the last two months, said Sharon Southard, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Protection, two  cubs died. Ms. Byron-Marasek did not report the deaths until days later, she said, and did not provide definitive records from her veterinarian on the cause of death, which was believed to be salmonella.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt that Joan loves these tigers,'' Ms. Southard said. ''But there are a couple of fundamental issues here, and one is that you can't have all these animals. Period. It's against the law.''</p>
        <p>As development in the area has increased, some neighbors have supported the preserve, conceding that the compound was there first. But residents of an adjacent three-year-old subdivision have sued Ms. Byron-Marasek and their builder, who, they say, did not tell them about the preserve. They say they are concerned that tigers may escape and that animal waste may contaminate their well water.</p>
        <p>As she sat at a table under some scrub pines, Ms. Byron-Marasek spread out a stack of documents to make her case that the state is trying to take her land because it has become valuable, and that the state's so-called tiger experts do not know as much as she does.</p>
        <p>Others who care for tigers -- including a group led by the actress Tippi Hedren -- have offered new homes for the animals.</p>
        <p>But the Tiger Lady has made no such plans.</p>
        <p>''I eat, sleep and breathe tigers,'' she said. ''I never take vacations. This is my love, my passion. The thought of losing my animals, I just can't bear it. I just want to believe that they won't take them.''</p>
