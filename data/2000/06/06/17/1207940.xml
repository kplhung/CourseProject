        <p>On a normal weekday morning, the entrance to the 72nd Street subway stop at Broadway can resemble the gates at a rock concert, with lines of commuters waiting outside just to get through the turnstiles. Downstairs, where the platforms are 10 feet across at their widest, commuters jostle for any available inch.</p>
        <p>But some elected officials contended yesterday that a routing change in the Bronx being considered by New York City Transit could make the 72nd Street station, already one of the most crowded in the city, more packed and even dangerous.</p>
        <p>Transit officials want to make the change because the Dyre Avenue branch of the No. 5 train now must cross a set of other tracks so it can run as an express between 180th Street and 149th Street. The crisscrossing trains, according to one transit memorandum, have long been ''difficult to schedule and even more difficult to operate in a reliable manner.''</p>
        <p>The result, the officials say, is a kind of domino effect that ends up forcing the No. 4 Lexington Avenue express line, the most heavily used in the city, to operate irregularly, leaving some trains packed and others underused.</p>
        <p>So officials want to eliminate the No. 5's express run between 180th Street and 149th Street and put the train on local tracks. But in a system where everything is interrelated, that change would not only make the trips of many No. 5 train riders in the Bronx longer, but it could also cause hundreds of commuters in the Bronx to switch to the No. 2 train at 180th Street. That would slow down that line, causing more crowding on No. 2 trains in Manhattan and having the biggest impact at 72nd Street.</p>
        <p>''This is already the most dangerous platform in the city,'' said State Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, who joined Assemblyman Scott M. Stringer and Mark Green, the city's public advocate, in front of the 72nd Street station yesterday to protest the change.</p>
        <p>''We have thousands more people moving into this community every month,'' said Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat who represents parts of the Upper West Side and the Bronx. ''And the M.T.A. is proposing to create a situation in which someone, someday is going to get pushed into a train as a result of these decisions.''</p>
        <p>Transit officials say those fears are vastly exaggerated. They say that they do not expect the change to increase crowding noticeably on No. 2 trains in Manhattan. Transit memorandums do show, however, that passenger volume in cars during the morning rush is expected to increase after the change, from 96 percent of capacity to 108 percent, at 72nd Street.</p>
        <p>Transit officials add that a $53 million renovation of the 72nd Street station -- which will not widen the platform but will widen stairs, lengthen the platform and add an entrance -- is expected to reduce crowding significantly on the platforms when it is completed in three years.</p>
        <p>''It's going to allow the existing platform space to be much better used,'' said Al O'Leary, the chief spokesman for New York City Transit.</p>
        <p>Transit officials have not yet set a date for the No. 5 rerouting. Mr. O'Leary said that although the change would cause inconvenience for some No. 5 riders in the Bronx, it would ultimately make huge parts of the system run more reliably.</p>
        <p>''As in every change we make on subway or bus service, it will benefit far more people than it will inconvenience, and if it didn't we wouldn't do it,'' Mr. O'Leary said. ''We firmly believe that given a little learning curve, people are going to figure out that this is better. Although on paper, we admit, it doesn't look as convenient.''</p>
