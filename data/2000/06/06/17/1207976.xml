      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio today defended a stock windfall in a company controlled by some of his contributors as a good investment that had involved no inside information.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said he had made the investment on the advice of a broker, whom he declined to name, but not through representatives of Quick &amp; Reilly, the brokerage in which he invested. He invested in special securities, known as options, in the company whose executives had given Mr. Lazio's Congressional campaigns $35,000 since 1965; he realized a 600 percent gain in six weeks.</p>
        <p>''Some stocks you get lucky on and some stocks you're unlucky on,'' Mr. Lazio said in an interview in this town a few miles west of Binghamton after one of four campaign stops he made upstate. Asked if he attributed his good fortune on the investment to luck, he replied, ''I would say I think that it was a good company and one that got batted down, and I thought that was an opportunity.''</p>
        <p>He said of the executives, ''I never had a single discussion with any of the people I know,'' and their contributions, he added, ad never influenced his votes on the House Banking and Commerce Committees.</p>
        <p>He said that his overall stock port-folio showed modest gains of about 10 or 5 percent, and that he had been diligent about disclosing the financial information required by federal law.</p>
        <p>''Pretty clearly, anyone who looks at my financial transactions, which are completely disclosed every year, can tell that I am not somebody who's getting rich on public service,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>''I only wish I had Hillary Clinton's stock adviser,'' Mr. Lazio said, a reference to his Democratic opponent's success in reaping $100,000 over 10 months after investing $1,000 in volatile commodities. Hillary Rodham Clinton was assisted by executives of a food company that had business before the state of Arkansas while her husband was attorney general and then governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio in fact attributed news reports on the investments in part to what he called an emerging pattern of negative campaigning by Mrs. Clinton. He was asked about the investments after an article appeared yesterday in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Some experts in securities law said that Mr. Lazio's entry into speculative options trading, coupled with his sizable short-term profit on the deal and his relationship with company executives, might have led to an insider trading investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the commission been aware of the trades when they occurred.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said, ''This is an effort by the Clinton campaign to draw me down in the mud, which I'm not going down to their level on.''</p>
        <p>Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, called the response from the Lazio campaign inadequate. ''Instead of pointing fingers, Congressman Lazio should answer legitimate questions that the story raises,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, in his speech to supporters here, decried two critical television commercials he said Mrs. Clinton's campaign was about to broadcast. But he acknowledged that he did not have proof that the Clinton campaign had influenced the articles on the options deal. ''That's just my presumption after you see this and that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also noted that the Clinton campaign had a worker known as a tracker videotaping him at virtually every campaign stop, a common practice among candidates but one Mr. Lazio called ''cloak and dagger.''</p>
        <p>''I don't know what happened to the Hillary Clinton who was complaining in the first couple days of this campaign about negative campaigning. But she has disappeared. I wish she would come back.''</p>
