        <p>The Los Angeles Lakers spoke confidently before Game 5 about a newfound ability to close out a series. No one had seen that ability, but the Lakers said it was there. After stumbling, sometimes horribly, in close-out games against Sacramento, Phoenix and Portland, the Lakers said they had learned to maintain their focus. They claimed to understand the importance of keeping their intensity, of squashing an opponent that is down.</p>
        <p>But these apparently are the same old Lakers. Probably soon to be National Basketball Association champions, but the same old Lakers. The ones who overwhelm opponents in building commanding series leads, only to start coasting and giving life to the other team.</p>
        <p>After slumbering for almost all 48 minutes in tonight's embarrassing 120-87 loss to the Indiana Pacers, the Lakers are 3-6 this postseason in games in which they could have eliminated an opponent.</p>
        <p>''It's just a sense of urgency that you have to have that we haven't developed yet as a team,'' said A. C. Green, who won N.B.A. titles with the Lakers in 1987 and in 1988.</p>
        <p>As it has done so many times this postseason, Los Angeles simply did not come ready to play. After outrebounding the Pacers in three of the first four games, the Lakers were beaten, 46-34, on the boards. They made just 4 of 19 3-pointers and shot 40 percent over all.</p>
        <p>Their defense was even worse. The league's stingiest team during the regular season was ravished for a 1970's-era point total and 57.4 percent shooting. As if shooting alone at a morning practice, the Pacers shot 75 percent in the first quarter and reached the 50-point mark 6 minutes 18 seconds before halftime.</p>
        <p>''There's no one to blame but us in this situation,'' Lakers Coach Phil Jackson said. ''We're not going to be angry about it one way or the other. We're frustrated that we didn't execute very well, didn't move the basketball very well, did too many things off the dribble. The thing that bothers us the most as a coaching staff is defensively.</p>
        <p>''You know, we're sitting in the driver's seat, and we're not in a situation where we have to get in a panic mode, but we have to play with more energy and more control.''</p>
        <p>After going up, three games to one, the Lakers were queried by reporters as if the series were over. They answered dozens of questions about being a budding dynasty. They were asked to compare themselves to the great teams of the past -- the Lakers and the Detroit Pistons of the 1980's and the Chicago Bulls of the 1990's. And Kobe Bryant, coming off his spectacular 28-point performance in Game 4, was being compared favorably to Michael Jordan.</p>
        <p>Jackson even felt comfortable enough to address that.</p>
        <p>''Kobe's probably a better player at 21 than Michael was at 21,'' Jackson said. ''He has a wonderful future, and we hope that he can fill those mighty big shoes. The chances are, he's not. Because he's just a special player, but he's still going to be a terrific player. He's got a lot of years to develop into that role.''</p>
        <p>Bryant was hurled violently back to the planet tonight, though. Jalen Rose and Reggie Miller took turns obliterating his defense. Regarded by many as the best defensive shooting guard in the league, Bryant was juked ridiculously a couple of times. On the other end, his night was even longer, as he scored just 8 points on 4-of-20 shooting.</p>
        <p>''I think Kobe held himself,'' Miller said when asked about stopping Bryant. ''He had a lot of good looks early. He probably got fouled on a couple of shots, but, hey, that's basketball.''</p>
        <p>There is not much question as to whether the Lakers, who lost a second-round, close-out game to Phoenix by 19 points, will forget about this nightmare and play well in Game 6. But the 33-point deficit, their worst of the season, rankled Jackson enough for him to question his team's greatness.</p>
        <p>''We've bounced back from games like this before,'' Jackson said. ''I don't like to think of a team that has championship quality in it that loses by 33 points. We have to prove something to ourselves when we go back home in this regard.''</p>
        <p>The Lakers thrive on challenges, and Jackson just issued one.</p>
