        <p>A federal judge ordered the breakup of the Microsoft Corporation today, saying the severe remedy was necessary because Microsoft ''has proved untrustworthy in the past'' and did not appear to have accepted his ruling that it had broadly violated the nation's antitrust laws.</p>
        <p>''There is credible evidence in the record to suggest that Microsoft, convinced of its innocence, continues to do business as it has in the past and may yet do to other markets what it has already done'' to dominate operating systems and Internet software, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said in his final ruling in the long-running trial.

        <p>A federal judge ordered the breakup of the Microsoft Corporation today, saying the severe remedy was necessary because Microsoft ''has proved untrustworthy in the past'' and did not appear to have accepted his ruling that it had broadly violated the nation's antitrust laws.</p>
        <p>''There is credible evidence in the record to suggest that Microsoft, convinced of its innocence, continues to do business as it has in the past and may yet do to other markets what it has already done'' to dominate operating systems and Internet software, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said in his final ruling in the long-running trial. [Text, Page C12.]</p>
        <p>Under his order, Microsoft would be broken into separate and competing companies, one for its Windows operating system and one for its other computer programs and Internet businesses. It would also be forced to comply with a long list of restrictions on its conduct lasting three years if the breakup order withstands appeal, and 10 years if it does not.</p>
        <p>Microsoft said it would appeal the case to the Court of Appeals, filing the papers within a few days, while the government said this evening that it would try to bypass that court and ask immediate review by the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>While an appeal proceeds, Judge Jackson's order stays the breakup plan, but not the restrictions on the company's conduct. Microsoft intends, however, to ask that the entire order be stayed.</p>
        <p>The government charged, and the judge agreed, that Microsoft had used its monopoly in operating systems to put competitors at a disadvantage and stifle innovation.</p>
        <p>In surprisingly assertive language, Judge Jackson accepted the government's remedy proposal in its entirety, attaching it to his ruling -- utterly rejecting Microsoft's repeated assertions that the breakup plan was ''Draconian,'' ''unwarranted'' and ''bad for consumers, the high-tech industry and our economy.''</p>
        <p>William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, called the judge's ruling ''an unwarranted and unjustified intrusion into the software marketplace, a marketplace that has been an engine of economic growth for America.''</p>
        <p>''The idea that someone would say that a breakup is a reasonable thing comes as quite a surprise to us,'' Mr. Gates added. ''We have a very strong case on appeal, and we look forward to resolving these issues through the appeals process and putting this case behind us once and for all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates was in Washington on Tuesday, planning to meet with lawmakers today. Anticipating the ruling, though, he canceled the meetings and hurriedly flew back to Seattle overnight.</p>
        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno, smiling broadly, said this afternoon that the ruling ''will have a profound impact, not only by promoting competition in the software industry, but also by reaffirming the importance of antitrust law enforcement in the 21st century.'' And Joel I. Klein, head of the department's antitrust division, said, ''Microsoft itself is responsible for where things stand today.''</p>
        <p>If the judge's order withstands appeal and Microsoft is eventually broken up, it would join a handful of major national monopolies that have been taken apart over the last 90 years as a result of antitrust violations, including Standard Oil, American Tobacco and the Aluminum Company of America.</p>
        <p>Tom Miller, the attorney general of Iowa, speaking on behalf of the 19 states that are partners with the Justice Department in the Microsoft case, said the ruling ''sends a strong message that no company is above the law.'' (Two of the 19 states, Illinois and Ohio, declined to support the breakup plan.)</p>
        <p>If Microsoft's request for a stay of Judge Jackson's order is rejected, the company must begin complying with the conduct restrictions by Sept. 7 and submit a detailed plan for dividing the company by Oct. 7.</p>
        <p>With Judge Jackson's encouragement, the Justice Department announced that it would take the case directly to the Supreme Court, under a 1974 revision to the federal antitrust laws allowing fast-track consideration of significant antitrust cases.</p>
        <p>Microsoft opposes the direct appeal to the Supreme Court, preferring to take its case first to the Court of Appeals, which ruled in its favor in a related lawsuit two years ago and reversed a decision by Judge Jackson.</p>
        <p>Whether the Supreme Court would even take the case is at best uncertain. Microsoft argued this evening that the suit filed by the states would not be eligible for expedited appeal because the states have no similar law. In that case, the states' appeal would be taken to the Court of Appeals. But state and federal officials said that because the cases were joined for trial, it would make no sense to separate them for differing legal appeals.</p>
        <p>The officials acknowledged that the point of law was ambiguous. But Richard Blumenthal, attorney general of Connecticut, said, ''Today's victory vindicates and soundly validates our decisions as state law enforcement officers to join this historic action.''</p>
        <p>If the conduct restrictions are allowed to take effect, computer manufacturers will be allowed to offer customized versions of Windows on their computers in ways they never could before. And future versions of Windows will be offered in a form that allows buyers to accept certain new software features Microsoft chooses to offer -- or to decide they do not want them and use a competing product.</p>
        <p>It was Microsoft's decision four years ago to tie a Web browser to Windows that prompted the investigation and lawsuits that led to the  breakup order today.</p>
        <p>Years from now, if the government's remedy plan works as intended, consumers might also begin to see alternate operating systems on sale that are competitive with Windows. If that occurs, the broad compatibility among personal computers that exists today might begin to erode.</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson issued his ruling at 4:30 this afternoon, just after the stock markets had closed. His decision had been widely expected, and investors appeared to have already taken the breakup plan into account. Microsoft stock was up 87.5 cents today, to close at $70.50.</p>
        <p>Asked at a news conference today if he had any regrets, Mr. Gates said: ''If I look back at anything, I think, perhaps I should have taken the opportunity to go in person and talk about this industry.''</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Gates might be called as a witness was a continuing question during the antitrust trial. His halting, obdurate performance in a videotaped deposition proved to be a powerful tool for the government in court.</p>
        <p>Though Judge Jackson accepted the remedy plan put together by the federal and state governments, his endorsement was not unequivocal.</p>
        <p>He noted that the plan was the collective work of senior state and federal officials ''in conjunction with multiple consultants.'' And, he said, the remedy ''appears to the court to address the principal objectives of relief in such cases, namely to terminate the unlawful conduct, to prevent its repetition in the future and to revive competition in the relevant markets.''</p>
        <p>But even though several experts provided ''some insight as to how the provisions'' of the remedy might work, ''for the most part they are merely the predictions of purportedly knowledgeable people as to effects which may or may not ensue if the proposed final judgment is entered,'' he added. ''In its experience, the court has found testimonial predictions of future events generally less reliable even than testimony as to historical fact.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft severely criticized the judge this evening for his decision to hold no substantive hearings on the government's remedy proposal. Microsoft said it had been surprised by the scope of the plan and had been unable to respond to it adequately in the six weeks since it was offered.</p>
        <p>But in his order today, Judge Jackson retorted: ''Microsoft's profession of surprise is not credible. From the inception of this case Microsoft knew, from well-established Supreme Court precedents dating from the beginning of the last century, that a mandated divestiture was a possibility, if not a probability, in the event of an adverse result at trial.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the government first made plain to Microsoft during settlement negotiations a year ago that it planned to ask for a so-called structural remedy. That was repeated during mediation efforts by a federal judge early this year, though the government offered terms short of a breakup after Microsoft said it would not discuss structural remedies.</p>
        <p>The judge also explained why he moved through the remedy phase so quickly, saying that he wanted to pass the case to a higher court as soon as possible for validation, revision or rejection of his decision, ''to abort any remedial measures before they become irreversible as a practical matter.''</p>
        <p>If necessary, the judge said he could hold hearings later or ''modify the judgment as necessary in accordance with instructions from an appellate court.''</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson noted, with some apparent irritation, that after he ruled on April 3 that Microsoft was in wide violation of the nation's antitrust laws, Microsoft's leaders continued to assert that ''the company has done 'nothing wrong' and that it will be vindicated on appeal.''</p>
        <p>''The court is well aware,'' he added, ''that there is a substantial body of public opinion, some of it rational, that holds a similar view. If true, then an appellate tribunal should be given an opportunity to confirm it as promptly as possible.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft's continued assertions of innocence were one reason for his ruling, he said. Another was that ''Microsoft has shown no disposition to voluntarily alter its business protocols in any significant respect.''</p>
        <p>A third reason, he said, was that Microsoft ''has proved untrustworthy in the past.'' As an example, he referred to the precedent case he tried in late 1997, after the government accused Microsoft of illegally tying a Web browser to Windows.</p>
        <p>In December 1997, Judge Jackson issued a preliminary injunction ordering Microsoft to separate the two products. That was the ruling later overturned by the Court of Appeals.</p>
        <p>But ''Microsoft's purported compliance while it was on appeal,'' the judge said today, ''was illusory and its explanation disingenuous.''</p>
