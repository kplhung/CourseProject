        <p>IN tower building, small is lovely. It is the tall imagination that counts.</p>
        <p>A few summers ago in Maine, I built a tower on a high hill overlooking the sea. My tower is only 12 by 12 1/2 feet and three stories high, if you generously include the observation deck.

        <p>IN tower building, small is lovely. It is the tall imagination that counts.</p>
        <p>A few summers ago in Maine, I built a tower on a high hill overlooking the sea. My tower is only 12 by 12 1/2 feet and three stories high, if you generously include the observation deck. Building up to that deck -- with simple tools, no electricity and little help -- was a major satisfaction, indeed a salvation, during a year that saw my marriage shaken and my faith often in shambles. A plague of cancers had descended on several of my friends, all of them young women. Their agony was one reason I had to lose myself in raising the tower. It became a tower of oblivion.</p>
        <p>You may wish to go higher than I did, but in many communities zoning restrictions will hold you below the treetops. You are, after all, contemplating an impractical, frivolous and idiosyncratic structure. And your next-door neighbor may worry that you will block the sun. (Try not to.)</p>
        <p>And of course, you will have to endure the phallus-substitute cracks. When this happens, point out that William Butler Yeats also had to listen to Freudian cheap shots from his friend Ezra Pound, who called his Thoor Ballylee ''Ballyphallus.''</p>
        <p>Yeats restored his tower, a Norman-era semi-ruin in County Galway, in 1917, with thick planks and paving stones from an old mill; it sheltered his family from the Irish Civil War. A winding staircase became Yeats's symbol for the ''widening gyre'' up the stairs of consciousness. He recalled his labor in his poem ''To Be Carved on a Stone at Thoor Ballylee'':</p>
        <p>I, the poet William Yeats,</p>
        <p>With old mill boards and sea-green slates,</p>
        <p>And smithy work from the Gort forge,</p>
        <p>Restored this tower for my wife George;</p>
        <p>And may these characters remain</p>
        <p>When all is ruin once again.</p>
        <p>James Joyce had a tower, too, at Sandycove near Dublin. He stayed only briefly, but something about it touched him. It appears at the start of ''Ulysses.''</p>
        <p>I built my tower near Sedgwick village, over the Atlantic. Because of its slow and steady pace, many residents of this peninsula live years longer than people from ''away,'' despite a climate that can be brutal, especially in winter. The terrific winds may be why Down East Maine is not known for its towers.</p>
        <p>But I had been summering here for many years and had recently constructed a cottage on nearby Deer Isle. I made up the cottage as I went along, with good advice from A. J., at the lumberyard. My tools were a hammer, a handsaw, a try square, a tape measure, a level and a length of Manila rope. I lost 20 unwanted pounds, but my great joy was in the making of it. I made a summer home for my little family.</p>
        <p>I first heard about Christy Hill from a real estate agent, and once I saw the lot, I wanted to buy it. As my dog, Opie, and I got out of the car, I looked northeast in the clear cold air to the crown of Blue Hill, scene of the annual Blue Hill Fair, the inspiration for E. B. White's tale of Wilbur the pig and Charlotte the spider. Twenty miles to the east were the mountains of Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island, and below me were dozens of lesser islands and ledges, fringed with ice. Beyond them the open ocean stirred quietly.</p>
        <p>In the distance I imagined I could just make out the top of Mount Katahdin, Maine's highest peak.</p>
        <p>There was no way I could afford it, I thought. What was this really but a 1.78-acre subdivision in the middle of nowhere? More important, how could I explain my infatuation to my wife, Annie? She might remind me that we often couldn't pay our bills, particularly that fuel bill the previous winter.</p>
        <p>I telephoned my friend Doris Grumbach in the little town of Sargentville, just the other side of the Deer Isle bridge. ''Can I drive you to church?'' I asked. She said I could, and afterward, I drove her to the top of the hill and pointed out the distant views across the fields.</p>
        <p>''What are you going to do here?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>''I don't know,'' I said. ''Probably leave it as it is.''</p>
        <p>Doris, who is always careful with her words, said nothing. In Maine, you are allowed to go as crazy as you wish.</p>
        <p>SOON I had my hill, but I couldn't dig my foundation until the April thaw, giving me most of the winter to dream of my ''tower for no reason.''</p>
        <p>There would be no neighbors near this tower with their busynesses, and no busynesses of my own. Just me and the wild turkeys, coyotes, moose, porcupines, skunks, deer, eagles and black bears. Uncompromised. At full attention. Lifted up. Nearer to the eternal spirit. Brother of Thoreau.</p>
        <p>Or maybe just a middle-aged guy and his version of a boy's treehouse.</p>
        <p>Because I couldn't afford help and my wife wanted nothing to do with the tower, I was going to be one guy alone with lots of lumber and concrete to haul into the woods, which as yet had no road, not even a path. And after I chose my site and assembled my materials, I would have to raise it all alone, and by hand.</p>
        <p>As for electricity, a line through the sweet woods from the main road? Never. And no gasoline machinery, either. No generators, no backhoes, no cranes, I pledged. Bad enough that I drove that smoking Oldsmobile. Someday it, too, would go. Then I would rediscover my feet by hiking up and down this magnificent hill.</p>
        <p>Like Yeats -- and like Thoreau, in building his Walden Pond cabin -- I saved by shopping for leftovers. Early in March, while bicycling the dead streets of the town on Long Island where I live, I came across a Dumpster with sections of a sliding glass door sticking out. Thermal-pane doors are heavy, but since they often refuse to slide, they are common in Dumpsters. And they are terrific fixed windows, if you can haul the panels to your car and to the site without developing a hernia.</p>
        <p>Sedgwick had granted me the freedom to erect whatever I liked. Now, I had only to seek permission from the wind. If I had been thinking clearly, my model would have been the Eiffel Tower, that 984-foot marvel of wind resistance. The Leaning Tower of Pisa provided lessons as well. When I was a Sunday school child, I was taught that you should begin your life on a firm foundation: on rock, not sand. Only later did I hear about the citizens of Pisa, and how a lousy foundation beneath their 180-foot tower made them rich, if not saintly.</p>
        <p>My foundation of choice was concrete posts, a terrific foundation for the amateur builder. All that is required is a strong back or a sturdy wheelbarrow, a shovel and buckets.</p>
        <p>The builder will also need eight-inch-diameter cardboard forms, premixed concrete, reinforcing bars and J-bolts.</p>
        <p>But the soil, unbuilt upon since perhaps forever, was not interested in my tower vision. When I started to dig, hammer, ax and shovel progressed only two feet into the ground.</p>
        <p>The local wisdom at the Sedgwick General Store was that a four-foot depth was the minimum.</p>
        <p>I called for help.</p>
        <p>Dave Webb arrived with his huge backhoe, and we talked as we walked through the woods to my problem. ''A tower,'' Dave mused. ''Gets breezy up here.'' He said no more. This was my project.</p>
        <p>At two and a half feet, the land started to screech in protest against the backhoe's metal fangs: bedrock. But after I paid Dave and he roared off down the hill, I realized the simple solution: if I couldn't get below two and a half feet, I'd pile up the earth one and a half feet around each post and achieve my four-foot burial. And I had to pour concrete now so that I could begin placement of the girders and joists when I returned later in the spring.</p>
        <p>With an old saw I cut each 12-foot-long tube into three four-foot sections and put the sections in two trenches, three on each side. I checked for level and added or subtracted soil as necessary. Then it was time for some heavy lifting: ready-mix Sakrete bags weigh 80 pounds each. Each post required somewhat more than two bags of mix, or 15 bags total. Since the ground was too rough for a wheelbarrow, my shoulder had to do for the march to the site.</p>
        <p>Each sack was followed by a bucket of water, which I hauled with my car to the top of the hill. With a garden trowel I blended the water and mix and poured the soup into the tube. I added the reinforcing bar, and finally pushed the J-bolt into the wet concrete, ready to receive the nut and the metal plate that would fasten to the main girder.</p>
        <p>The two-by-six floor joists would be nailed to these girders, and the plywood floor would be attached to the top of the joists. This would be a terrific foundation, I thought, as the March night closed.</p>
        <p>When I returned to the spot in June, the tiny birch and beech leaves were just out, pale and tender. I was halfway along the path into the woods when something to the right formed out of the fog. Something very large -- framed and sheathed, it was a two-story house-in-progress, just 20 feet from my property line.</p>
        <p>I'd have to begin all over again: digging six holes inch by inch in the rocks and roots, shouldering 15 bags of 80-pound concrete mix and many buckets of water to a new foundation.</p>
        <p>Why did I need to build this tower? What was the point? Food for mosquitoes, flies and worms I was. Dejected, I sat on an old stone wall at the center of the property.</p>
        <p>Then I noticed a large patch of moss almost the measurement of my intended tower. Here, nearly 400 feet above sea level (almost as high as the Great Pyramid of Cheops at Giza) was the archetypal foundation, solid Big Bang granite. ''Thank you,'' I muttered to the moss.</p>
        <p>THAT summer I fell into a consuming maelstrom that centered around my marriage. I suspected that Annie felt the same. I imagined she wanted me gone. My foundations of home and faith were evaporating in a marital fury. My daughter, Holly, then 11, remained, but I couldn't share any of this with her. I was, in short, hysterical.</p>
        <p>And alone in the Maine woods without power tools.</p>
        <p>As Thomas Merton observed, tough common work is a great purifier. Hand-sawing those studs, slamming in those 16-penny nails, hefting frames into place on the platform with nobody around to help me if I lost my footing, concentrated my rage and dissipated my hysteria.</p>
        <p>Towers have been built for many reasons. Mine was founded on the edge of despair and framed in pure frenzy. Later, I discovered that an astonishing series of modern towers had been created by a man who, in a similar mood, happened to share some of my demons.</p>
        <p>The Watts Towers were the creations of Simon Rodia, a bad-tempered, lyrical little guy with enormous energy. Simon, or Sam, as he was later known, was born in a village near Naples, Italy, that annually celebrated a pageant, dating from the Middle Ages, featuring great ceremonial towers -- eight of them, six stories high and three tons each.</p>
        <p>Sam Rodia left Italy at 15 and wandered here and there until he was hired in California as a concrete worker. As his third marriage failed in 1921, he started his first tower, and he didn't quit until 1955, when he had completed three lacy, intricately decorated spirals of wire and reinforced concrete in his backyard. Two of these towers are almost 100 feet tall, the third a mere 55 feet. To me, his soaring spires, now the center of a state historic park, are the ultimate in backyard tower construction -- dances of caprice, anger, joy and nostalgia. They have withstood seven major earthquakes. They are also the tallest structures ever made by one man alone.</p>
        <p>If you build all day, every day, as I did for many summertime weeks at age 54, you will emerge a far younger man. I framed out an opening for my handsome red door (found at the East Hampton dump) and raised a two-by-four stud frame. (Don't try it in a wind, as I did at first, unless you have an escape route.) At the corners of the east and west walls, I tripled the studs and fitted the north and south walls inside them for support in a gale. For the next floor, I used seven-foot wall studs, not the usual eight-footers -- less height but also less to wobble in the wind, I guessed. And any tower worth its name should incorporate an inside stairway, leading to a balcony. (I would let sunlight do my decorating.)</p>
        <p>I guessed that my 10-foot two-by-six joists could run across the girders and stick out at each side. The extra foot at each end didn't seem like much of an overhang at the time, but it made a difference in stability that I would profoundly appreciate while finishing the summit.</p>
        <p>As I was ready to nail on the roof sheathing and start with the tar paper and the rolled roofing, I looked over the edge at the rocks below.</p>
        <p>All sense of balance was gone -- and the tower was definitely shifting under me. Death was a few feet away, somewhere.</p>
        <p>In my dreaming, I had ignored a problem: vertigo. As a child, I could scramble up any tree without a care, but now I couldn't climb open stairs without clawing for support and inching back down on my hands and knees. That's one reason the views from the tops of the great steeples and monuments of Europe and America were unknown to me.</p>
        <p>A few days later, I discovered the secret of amateur semi-sloping roof-building: the crab-scuttle butt-sit. I scuttled about that roof, growing bolder and bolder until, by sunset, I had nailed down all the sheathing.</p>
        <p>By the end of the second day, I had a roof that didn't dare leak and vertigo that had slunk away, defeated by the same spirit that I also learned could control the panic. Embrace it. Wait. Be still.</p>
        <p>If you are thinking of constructing your own tower, I suggest that you don't become overly analytical. Resist your shrink's advice that you devote more time and money to psychological explanations for your urges; avoid your doctor's offers of Prozac or Viagra; harden your heart against your spouse's complaint that what you really need is a used Volvo.</p>
        <p>By scrounging and following Thoreau's example, I was able to build my tower for $2,264.56. Putting together that modest tower was a priceless rediscovery of my spirit.</p>
        <p>Nothing else much matters, including all the towers of the earth.</p>
