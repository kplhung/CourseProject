        <p>This is a 30-second commercial produced for the Republican Leadership Council, a moderate Republican organization, on behalf of Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for United States Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton. The council describes itself as independent of Mr. Lazio's campaign, and thus can use largely unregulated ''soft money'' to finance the ad. The council plans to spend $100,000 to run the commercials for two weeks in Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Binghamton. The ad is notable for one particularly grabbing image: a photograph of President Clinton in the Oval Office. It also includes praise from the president of Mr. Lazio's record.</p>

        <p>This is a 30-second commercial produced for the Republican Leadership Council, a moderate Republican organization, on behalf of Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for United States Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton. The council describes itself as independent of Mr. Lazio's campaign, and thus can use largely unregulated ''soft money'' to finance the ad. The council plans to spend $100,000 to run the commercials for two weeks in Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Binghamton. The ad is notable for one particularly grabbing image: a photograph of President Clinton in the Oval Office. It also includes praise from the president of Mr. Lazio's record.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Jamestown Associates</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The ad is a montage of sunny images shot during Mr. Lazio's bus trip across New York, starting with him walking into a crowd waving American flags, continuing with President Clinton delivering his Saturday morning radio address in the Oval Office, and ending with Mr. Lazio speaking to supporters and standing in front of his bus. There is a moment when Mr. Clinton and Mr. Lazio are in the same frame. A careful observer can note the swollen lip Mr. Lazio suffered from a fall just before the trip. A series of phrases, including ''cut taxes,'' ''reform welfare,'' ''balance budget,'' appear. The words leadership and bipartisanship are displayed as the announcer notes that Mr. Clinton used those words in describing Mr. Lazio's efforts on behalf of a bill providing health care for the disabled and financing for breast cancer research.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''Republicans and Democrats agree -- Rick Lazio is a leader. Lazio fought to cut taxes, reform welfare and balance the budget. Even President Clinton repeatedly praised Lazio for his 'leadership' in protecting health care for the disabled and his strong 'bipartisan support' for work on behalf of breast cancer victims. The record is clear. Rick Lazio is a leader. Call. Tell Rick Lazio to keep fighting for issues important to us.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Lazio has voted in favor of tax cuts and welfare reductions, as well as for a balanced budget amendment. In finding Mr. Clinton's words of praise for Mr. Lazio, the Republican Leadership Council turned to official announcements from the White House press office.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- This is the second advertisement that has been placed on Mr. Lazio's behalf by groups that claim no ties to the campaign, and using soft money. Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said last night that Mr. Lazio voted last month against a provision that would have forced organizations like the Republican Leadership Council to disclose its donors and their affiliations.  Although Mark H. Miller, the executive director of the council, asserted that there was no cooperation between his organization and the campaign, the ad fairly precisely tracks some of Mr. Lazio's early themes. Most of all, it is a clear bid for independent voters and Democrats who might be unhappy with Mrs. Clinton -- from its prominent inclusion of Mr. Clinton to its emphasis on issues that tend to be of interest to Democratic voters, like health care for the disabled.</p>
