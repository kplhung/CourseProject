        <p>A new survey suggests that e-mail users tend to make fewer long-distance phone calls, but that doesn't mean that they are ready to abandon the telephone altogether. The study, published in the journal Communication Research, found that almost half of the 309 Columbus, Ohio, residents surveyed had used long-distance less after they began using personal e-mail, although they were not asked how much less. But the respondents still rated the telephone very high for socializing and as a way to express emotion, while e-mail was favored when there was a scheduling conflict or when a phone call would otherwise have to be made to a different time zone.</p>
