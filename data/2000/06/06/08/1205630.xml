        <p>THEY have bushy green hair, a wardrobe borrowed from Alvin the Chipmunk, no will (except to walk) and no instinct whatsoever for self-preservation. When they reach a ledge, they fall. When the fall is long and ends on a hard surface, they splat.</p>
        <p>The lemmings, who strolled onto the computer game scene in 1991, have returned in their first new game in almost four years. Lemmings Revolution, which blends conventional lemming-saving with a modest taste of 3-D, serves as a reminder of both the pleasures of a proven concept and the lost art of playing the good Samaritan.</p>
        <p>The tiny, suicidal creatures that populate this puzzle game remain as cute as the proverbial button, and none the wiser for the passage of time. Real-world lemmings were once said to drown themselves during mass migrations, although now we know that they don't really seek death -- their straight-ahead style of migration sometimes gets them into trouble when what's ahead is a big lake or an ocean. Their virtual cousins apparently have not heard about the latest research and still trek inexorably, in single file, from the entry trapdoor to their doom.</p>
        <p>The lemmings drown in water, cook in lava, dissolve in acid. They are dismantled by traps or sent flying by equally tiny weasels (the reason the lemmings are in this fix to begin with) equipped with tiny red boxing gloves. Each still meets its demise by squeaking, ''Oh, no!'' It sounds as if it had accidentally left its A.T.M. card at home.</p>
        <p>In each of 100 levels, you must intercede to rescue a predetermined number of lemmings by shepherding them to hot-air balloons before a clock runs out. They are nothing if not adaptable. You click on icons at the side of the screen and then on the relevant lemming to imbue it with one or more skills. Many of the 16 included in the game (no more than 8 of them in a given level) will be familiar from Lemmings games past.</p>
        <p>A ''blocker'' obstructs the path of its fellow lemmings and sends them walking back in the opposite direction. When falling, a ''floater'' will pop open a tiny umbrella to slow its descent. A ''builder'' assembles a wooden staircase of finite length. A ''basher'' claws its way horizontally through the appropriate terrain.</p>
        <p>New additions to the Lemmings  canon include trampoline and antigravity skills, which can turn a level's treacherous platforms and pitfalls upside down. Complicating the picture are lemming species that are impervious to certain hazards. In the course of solving a level, you may have to attend to the needs of more than one breed and find yourself struggling to adopt different strategies for their different paths.</p>
        <p>Revolution's tone is very like the tone of early Lemmings games. There is something delightful about watching a critter no bigger than a hangnail scale a wall or build a bridge, plank by plank. (It's a bit like watching an ant farm.) Moreover, the levels preserve their airy atmosphere right up to the moment when they turn wicked.</p>
        <p>These cleverly constructed challenges range from simple explorations of a given skill to exercises in careful placement or timing to seemingly impossible challenges that require the player to look ahead and see beyond the obvious uses of skills. For instance, a ''builder'' lemming's staircase isn't always a path to higher ground. Built in the right place, it might break a lemming's fall.</p>
        <p>I suspect the appeal is also related to the player's point of view, a retreat from the unconventional perspectives of 3D Lemmings, from 1995, and Lemmings Paintball, from 1996. In Revolution, each level is wrapped around the exterior of a giant spindle, which you can rotate at will with the mouse. (Hence the title.) That gives the game the trappings of modernity without its burdens. It is 3-D that feels almost like 2-D, and that, as a result, comes across like the games of the early and mid-90's: Lemmings, Lemmings 2: Tribes and the Lemmings Chronicles.</p>
        <p>The resemblance is not simply physical. Revolution's creator -- Psygnosis, of Leeds, England, which published earlier Lemmings games -- has tapped into the same wellspring of good feeling that comes from being the savior of small, helpless creatures. In many current games, clearing a path means killing anything that moves. Here, it means removing anything that kills, and Revolution distinguishes itself with this essential generosity of spirit.</p>
        <p>The four-year hiatus may have been a good thing. When the Lemmings line was in its heyday, it generated a cottage industry of similar games: Humans, Diggers, Troddlers. Little creatures seemed to be in jeopardy everywhere. These days, with Revolution standing more or less alone, it's easy to develop a renewed appreciation for its sweet style.</p>
        <p>Booting up the game was rather like stepping into a time machine. It took me back to a simpler era, when such innocent pursuits constituted a larger share of the game market, when we were outside games more than we were in them and when most games fit on a single disk. It's a small world after all.</p>
        <p>Revolution feels economical, even though the typical installation will take up roughly 450 megabytes on your hard disk and the minimum requirement of a 266-megahertz Pentium II is relatively hefty for a game. It loads speedily and can be learned easily and played quickly (though mastery is another matter). Even at its most challenging, it is comparatively weightless.</p>
        <p>To be sure, death remains part of the bargain here (although cute, squeaky death). But it is bloodless and, at worst, an act of omission on the player's part. The only lemmings you are likely to have to kill outright -- using the ''nuke'' command, which obliterates all lemmings remaining in a level -- are the ''blockers'' you have left behind because they remain fixed in place even after they have run out of lemmings to redirect. Think of it as a lesson not so much in death as in altruism.</p>
