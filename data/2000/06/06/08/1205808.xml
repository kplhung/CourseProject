        <p>When discussing last year's fight with Felix Trinidad, Oscar De La Hoya likes to refer to his defeat as that decision.</p>
        <p>And while De La Hoya still believes he won the September bout that concluded with a split-decision victory for Trinidad, De La Hoya has nonetheless also begun to call the loss ''a blessing in disguise.''</p>
        <p>''I was getting lazy; I was getting tired,'' De La Hoya said yesterday in a conference call with reporters to promote his June 17 welterweight title fight with Shane Mosley at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''Even right up to the Trinidad fight, I was only training enough to beat the guy I was fighting. But that's how the Trinidad fight woke me up. If I'm not in great shape, anyone can beat me.''</p>
        <p>De La Hoya, who called Mosley a skilled fighter with no weaknesses, said he was training differently this time.</p>
        <p>''I've been very, very focused,'' the 27-year-old De La Hoya said. ''I blame myself for the other close fights. I know what I did and didn't do in training camp. I know what happened. But that's all changed. Now I train harder and smarter. That's why the Trinidad decision was meant to be.''</p>
        <p>Mosley, a 28-year-old former lightweight champion, is undefeated in 34 fights with 32 knockouts.</p>
        <p>Asked to describe his strategy for the Mosley fight, De La Hoya (32-1) answered, ''Attack, attack, attack.''</p>
