        <p>Editorial urges Israeli Prime Min Ehud Barak to ask Shas religious party to agree to subordinate its pursuit of parochial causes to wider Israeli interest in negotiating peace with Palestinians in return for concessions he will have to make to party to preserve his governing coalition</p>

        <p>A cabinet crisis was the last thing Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, needed days ahead of a potentially decisive new round of peace talks with the Palestinians. But that is exactly what he got yesterday when three member parties of his governing coalition joined the opposition in a preliminary vote for new elections. Three more votes must be held before the bill becomes law. Regrettably, Mr. Barak must now divert attention from peacemaking to repairing his coalition.</p>
        <p>The most damaging defection came from the Sephardic religious party, Shas. Without the party's 17 votes, the coalition would lose its majority. Shas's argument with Mr. Barak is not over peacemaking but over its demand for additional government money for its private school system. Shas wants to be able to offer all-day classes, easing the child care burdens of its working-class constituents. The government wants to rein in the budget.</p>

        <p>A cabinet crisis was the last thing Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, needed days ahead of a potentially decisive new round of peace talks with the Palestinians. But that is exactly what he got yesterday when three member parties of his governing coalition joined the opposition in a preliminary vote for new elections. Three more votes must be held before the bill becomes law. Regrettably, Mr. Barak must now divert attention from peacemaking to repairing his coalition.</p>
        <p>The most damaging defection came from the Sephardic religious party, Shas. Without the party's 17 votes, the coalition would lose its majority. Shas's argument with Mr. Barak is not over peacemaking but over its demand for additional government money for its private school system. Shas wants to be able to offer all-day classes, easing the child care burdens of its working-class constituents. The government wants to rein in the budget.</p>
        <p>It is a long-running quarrel in which both sides have shown some willingness to compromise. Shas was wrong to press the issue to the point of calling for new elections. But some further concession by Mr. Barak toward Shas's demands is now probably necessary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak rightly decided when he formed his government last year that he needed support from the broadest possible cross-section of Israelis to sustain the compromises necessary for peace. That assessment remains just as true today. The other two defecting parties, the National Religious Party and the Russian immigrant party led by Natan Sharansky, are two of the most hawkish in the coalition.</p>
        <p>Winning back these two relatively small parties would be desirable. But retaining Shas is virtually essential. Mr. Barak's only alternative would be to form an extremely narrow coalition of the center-left that would have trouble selling any peace agreements it reached.</p>
        <p>Early next week, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are scheduled to begin talks near Washington meant to prepare for a possible Camp-David-style retreat later this summer. That meeting would bring Mr. Barak, the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, and President Clinton together in an effort to reach a final peace agreement. Those talks should proceed as planned.</p>
        <p>Shas, meanwhile, should be asked, as the price of any further concessions, to pledge that from now on it will subordinate its pursuit of parochial causes to the wider Israeli interest in negotiating peace.</p>
