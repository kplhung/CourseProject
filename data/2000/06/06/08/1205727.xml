        <p>The Devils have not decided how they will celebrate if they win the Stanley Cup. When the team won the cup in 1995, it celebrated with a parade in the parking lot outside Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>''Any decision is something we'll have to discuss with John McMullen and Lou Lamoriello and their style is not to discuss it until there's a need to,'' said John Samerjan, a spokesman for the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, referring to the team's owner and president.</p>

        <p>The Devils have not decided how they will celebrate if they win the Stanley Cup. When the team won the cup in 1995, it celebrated with a parade in the parking lot outside Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>''Any decision is something we'll have to discuss with John McMullen and Lou Lamoriello and their style is not to discuss it until there's a need to,'' said John Samerjan, a spokesman for the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, referring to the team's owner and president.</p>
        <p>The Devils hold a 3-1 lead over Dallas and could win the cup tonight at the Continental Arena, which would allow the team to hold a celebration over the weekend, when it would be more likely to draw a larger crowd. Options include repeating the 1995 parade, or inviting fans inside the arena or Giants Stadium to honor the team. The Giants celebrated inside Giants Stadium after they won the Super Bowl in January 1987.</p>
        <p>A Devils spokesman declined to comment.</p>
