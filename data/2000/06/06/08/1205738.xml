        <p>No Triple Crown suspense this time on the day of the Belmont Stakes. No showdown between the Kentucky Derby winner and the Preakness winner. For that matter, not even a solo performance by either Fusaichi Pegasus or Red Bullet,</p>
        <p>But after three years of drama when star colts were thwarted on the edge of completing a Triple Crown sweep, the race will still be run Saturday at Belmont Park. It is the 132nd Belmont Stakes, and it will still be run at a mile and a half with a purse of $1 million.</p>
        <p>The race drew 11 horses yesterday, with two Derby survivors installed as the favorites: Aptitude, who ran second to Fusaichi Pegasus in Louisville, listed first in the early betting line at 8-5, and Impeachment, who ran third in the Derby and the Preakness, listed next at 9-2.</p>
        <p>Todd Pletcher, who trains Impeachment, considered the question that hung over the draw ceremony at Belmont Park, and said: ''How is the race changed because the two best horses aren't running? I don't think we know for sure if the best horses aren't running.</p>
        <p>''Championships aren't decided this early in the year. The 3-year-old division is wide open and we have a long way to go.''</p>
        <p>Aptitude drew the No. 5 post position and Impeachment drew No. 8, but nobody saw any great significance in the starting-gate assignments because Belmont Park is the longest, broadest track in America; it is a mile and a half around with sweeping turns.</p>
        <p>Appearing Now, a 30-1 long shot, drew the rail; the speedy long shot Hugh Hefner drew No. 10 and was listed at 50-1; and Tahkodha Hills at 30-1 drew the No. 11 gate on the extreme outside.</p>
        <p>More important than post position, most trainers agreed, would be the degree of freshness a horse brought into the starting gate. Only Impeachment ran against Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet in the Derby and the Preakness. But only Aptitude finished as high as second in the Derby before skipping the Preakness.</p>
        <p>In fact, Aptitude finished second to Fusaichi Pegasus in the Derby after running second to Red Bullet in the Gotham and third behind both of them in the Wood Memorial.</p>
        <p>''It's too early to talk about championships,'' said Bobby Frankel, who trains Aptitude. ''If you don't win the Kentucky Derby, there are a million other races out there that will determine championships and such. That's why we skipped the Preakness. It is very easy to destroy these young horses early. It didn't make sense to try to get one more victory. What for? We want to have a horse for races like the Travers and for races later this year and when he's older.''</p>
        <p>Another horse who ran a strong Derby but skipped the Preakness was Wheelaway, a son of Unbridled who ran first in the Tampa Bay Derby, third in the Blue Grass and fifth in the Kentucky Derby under Richard Migliore.</p>
        <p>''I think having a fresh horse is a positive in this race,'' said John Kimmel, who trains Wheelaway for his father, Caesar Kimmel. ''He's trained better than ever at Belmont, and I think he would have gotten third in the Derby had he gotten a more patient ride. What we learned from the Derby was that this horse made a premature, aggressive move and then got out in the lane.</p>
        <p>''The question is when to ask him and how much to ask him. If you ask too soon, he'll give you everything. We can't do what we did in the Derby, which was to run all out from the five-sixteenths pole to the finish with everyone going fast up front. Richie knows his horse better now. He knows to sit chilly on him a little longer. You don't want to move too soon.''</p>
        <p>Third in the betting line was Unshaded, who wasn't entered in the Belmont until Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet left. He is also a son of Unbridled, winner of the 1990 Kentucky Derby, and he skipped the Derby and the Preakness because of inexperience.</p>
        <p>But he won the Lexington Stakes, ran second in the Peter Pan while carrying 10 more pounds than the winner and was booked into the Belmont only this week.</p>
        <p>''The Peter Pan was a confusing race for us because Unshaded was in a school he had never been to before,'' said Unshaded's trainer, Carl Nafzger. ''Once he figured things out, he made a pretty nice run. On the last 50 yards, he focused really well and got up to finish second.''</p>
        <p>So, without the two star colts who defected, the Belmont offers a kind of reprieve for horses who could not catch them in the classics. But it also reflects the sweep of modern racing.</p>
        <p>''There's no last chance for a horse these days,'' Pletcher said. ''You have three classics within five weeks. Then you still have the Haskell for a million dollars, the Jockey Club Gold Cup for a million and the Breeders' Cup for a million and more.''</p>
