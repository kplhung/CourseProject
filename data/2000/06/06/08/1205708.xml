        <p>Vice President Al Gore, ever on the prowl for money, has found a new source: American Indians.</p>
        <p>Beginning a three-day West Coast campaign swing, Mr. Gore raised nearly $1 million at three events today, including $400,000 from a group of Indians at a luncheon in Palm Springs at the Hilton Hotel.</p>
        <p>Edward G. Rendell, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, which organized the events, said that although many Indians had attended fund-raisers for the party in the past, these were the first events held exclusively with Indians. Representatives of 16 tribes from the region -- there are more than 400 tribes across the country -- were in Palm Springs attending a tribal council meeting, and about 40 of them ate lunch with Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rendell, who noted the emerging economic power among Indians from casinos and shopping malls, said that at least 80 percent of those Indians who voted traditionally voted Democratic, and there seemed to be considerable support for the vice president among this group.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore has made a commitment to who we are as a people,'' Mary Ann Martin Andreas, chairwoman of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians from Banning, Calif., said in introducing the vice president.</p>
        <p>Barbara Gonzales Lyons of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahulla Indians, and vice chairwoman of the council, said, ''Vice President Al Gore has taken the time to meet and speak with us and candidate Bush has not,'' referring to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Mr. Gore's Republican rival.</p>
        <p>Other officials said that Indians  looked more favorably on Mr. Gore than on Mr. Bush because Mr. Bush had suggested that states be allowed to determine whether gambling could occur on Indian reservations. Without directly endorsing gambling, Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman, said of the Indians, ''We support their right to do what they want to do on their land.''</p>
        <p>In a brief and solemn speech, Mr. Gore said that he recognized that the tribes' agenda -- including better health care and more economic opportunities -- had received too little attention. ''I don't wear rose-colored glasses,'' he said, ''but I think that it's important to take stock of the fact that we have made success in the direction of progress.''</p>
        <p>He cited his support for tribal sovereignty, tribal hunting and fishing rights and economic empowerment zones, but said more needed to be done to attract investments and jobs to Indian reservations.</p>
        <p>''I know -- I say that I know, but I don't know in the same way that you know -- the burden of history on Indian people,'' Mr. Gore said. He said he understood how ''travails as well as opportunities can cascade down through the generations, parents to children to grandchildren and on and on, to the seventh generation and then beyond.'' Indians traditionally refer to the seventh generation as a symbol of the future. But, he said, ''we have the ability to interrupt the cycle.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Gore was collecting money from this group, he lamented doing so. ''I accept that there's a great irony in this process,'' he said, adding that he was determined to overhaul the campaign finance system. ''We need sweeping reforms to end the money chase,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore then flew here to a fund-raising reception at the home of Brad Krevoy, chief executive officer of the Motion Picture Corporation of America, where 100 people gave $1,000 each to the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>He then had a date at the Conga Room in Los Angeles, where 65 people were paying $5,000 each to have dinner with him.</p>
