        <p>There were two clear winners in the World Bridge Federation's Worldwide Bridge Contest last week, and many probable ones. In the first session, on Friday, 7,488 pairs played in 61 countries. In the second session, on Saturday, 5,304 pairs played in 48 countries.</p>
        <p>The clear winners, who were not even playing, were Anna Gudge and Mark Newton of Sudbury, England. They designed and operated some amazing software that permitted the results to be scored as one field. Within a few hours the provisional rankings and detailed scores of all players were available online.</p>
        <p>The provisional world winners on Friday were L. Treta and E. Raffa of Italy, with 192,449.45 match points, or 73.37 percent. The North American winners were Hugh Morrison and Toby Bassett, playing in Metairie, La., fourth in the world with 71.41 percent. The best score in the New York region was by Paul Klarreich and Anna Bromberg, who were 17th in the world with 69.59 percent, playing at the Franklin Club in Franklin Square on Long Island.</p>
        <p>The provisional world winners on Saturday were the players listed as Lelin and Luowenchan of Guangzhou, China, with 133,652.48 match points, or 75.28 percent. The North American winners were Michael Farrell and Gerald Di Vicenzo, playing in Burlington, Vt., third in the world with 73.44 percent. The best score in the New York region was by Robert Kuhnreich and Elliot Sternlicht, who were 13th in the world with 68.89 percent, playing at Honors Club in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The diagramed deal from Friday's game appears to have set a world record. There were no less than 76 different results. The official commentary by Eric Kokish points out that the deal ''belongs'' to East-West, who have 15 high-card points but cannot be defeated in four hearts. The only game that North-South can make legitimately is three no-trump, although four no-trump or five clubs will make unless the defense is accurate.</p>
        <p>In the diagramed auction East's jump to four diamonds is fit-showing, indicating a heart fit and diamond length. This helps West to choose a diamond lead if North-South continue, as they should, to five clubs.</p>
        <p>After the lead of the diamond queen, the official analysis says, East must overtake and continue diamonds. This is true, but it is far from obvious that South can succeed if the diamond queen wins and West shifts to a trump.</p>
        <p>South must win and play a second trump, ending in his hand. He must then cash the heart ace, throwing a diamond from the dummy, and lead the heart queen. He allows West to win with the king, throwing the remaining diamond from the dummy. West is forced to lead a spade from the queen or give a ruff-sluff, so the game is made.</p>
