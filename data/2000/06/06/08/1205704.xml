        <p>In the first national commercial of the general election campaign, the Democratic National Committee is to begin running this 30-second spot in 15 states today, detailing Vice President Al Gore's views on the cost of prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Democratic Victory 2000</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Shots of a 74-year-old Medicare recipient, Bob Darthez, followed by shots of Mr. Gore. Interspersed are graphics highlighting Mr. Gore's position on prescription drug benefits.</p>
        <p>Announcer: Every week, Bob Darthez has to afford his groceries and his prescription drugs. He's worked a lifetime, but now he's at the mercy of the big drug companies. They're using money and lobbyists to stop progress in Washington. Al Gore is taking them on. Fighting for a Medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors like Bob Darthez.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore: People can't afford these ridiculously high prices for prescription medicines. When their doctor prescribes medicine for their health and well-being, they ought to be able to take it.</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Congressional Democrats and Republicans have been unable to come to an agreement over offering the drug benefits to all 39 million people on Medicare. Things on which they differ include whether drug companies should have to pay into the Medicaid trust fund when they profit from federally funded research and whether the drugs should be guaranteed as an entitlement to any Medicare beneficiary. The spot's recounting of Mr. Darthez's experience is reflective of the complaints many elderly people on fixed incomes have about the high cost of prescription drugs, and the Clinton administration has indeed been actively campaigning for the expansion of Medicare to include the prescription benefit. The description of the drug companies may be the commercial's most incendiary aspect; the industry, which warns that a government curb on prices could put a damper on research, complains that Democrats have tried to demonize the drug makers.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Democrats are trying to take the lead in the presidential race on a cause that is highly popular with voters, particularly older ones, who tend to turn out in higher proportions. Some House Democrats have described it as perhaps ''the single most potent issue we have back home.''</p>
        <p>The complete commercial is available from The New York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com/politics</p>
