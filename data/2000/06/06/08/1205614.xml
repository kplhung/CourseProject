        <p>IT was Thursday at rush hour on the street in front of Grand Central Terminal, and it was a cell phone circus.</p>
        <p>Some of it was predictable. People walking with phones to their cheeks, leaning against buildings, plugging their ears against the sounds of trucks, buses and sirens, shouting above the din.</p>
        <p>Nothing unusual, except for one young man, carrying his portable CD player, no cell phone in sight, who seemed to be having an animated conversation with himself. It was another common city sight, except that his words were completely comprehensible, as if he were talking to a real person, not some imaginary adversary. In fact, he was discussing the virtues of ESPN Zone.</p>
        <p>Meet a new breed of cell phone user: a small but growing number of mobile talkers who have decided to put down their phones and plug in to accessories that enable them to go hands free. Tiny ear pieces and microphones are now spotted dangling next to cheeks. Many drivers are adopting slightly bulkier headsets or using a barely visible microphone and speaker mounted in the car.</p>
        <p>As a result, people in large cities, in particular, will soon face another round of weird social behavior stemming from cell phone use. Just a few years ago, handheld cell phones elicited stares and whispers, especially in public areas like airports and coffee shops.</p>
        <p>Now, just as the sight of people standing on street corners screaming into pieces of plastic has become commonplace and cell phone etiquette remains uncodified, wearable phones have arrived to complicate matters. ''Cell phones have started to become socially accepted,'' said Phil Hester, chief technology officer at I.B.M.'s personal systems group. ''These ear buds are pushing it to the next level.''</p>
        <p>The young man with the CD player was Davis Macias, a college student, who had his phone attached to his belt, a microphone clipped to his shirt and an earphone in his left ear. He was talking to a friend on 67th street who was walking to work wearing the same kind of contraption.</p>
        <p>So far, of course, most people do not wear their phones. The proportion of Americans buying headsets is under 5 percent. But that number has been rising for two years, according to recent survey results from the International Data Corporation. And if users in countries with more cell phones can be a guide, the number of people getting around with wearable phones will continue to go up.</p>
        <p>In London, ''you can walk around the city and see people using them everywhere,'' said Jim Moore, a consultant for McKinsey &amp; Company who recently lived in Europe and who would not even think about using a handheld cell phone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore adopted a headset to avoid the ache of holding up the phone. Others, interviewed on the streets of Manhattan, said they had heard that holding cell phones to the head causes brain tumors (So far, the Food and Drug Administration has said that such risks cannot be confirmed nor ruled out.) And most simply liked being able to use both hands while chatting.</p>
        <p>''It's just so convenient,'' said Wilson Ortega, who wore a headset as he stood in line at a midtown Starbucks last week. When a cell phone rang inside the pocket of his baggy jeans, he took a peek at the phone, slid it back into his pocket and said a soft hello into a microphone hanging by his face.</p>
        <p>How the new technology will fit into the current cell phone confusion is not clear. People already complain about the rude intrusions of ringing cell phones in movie theaters and the annoyance of hearing one side of someone's extended phone conversation while on the bus. And that is when they can at least see the phone.</p>
        <p>Social scientists say much of the consternation is caused by the blurring of the lines between public and private spaces -- lines that will become even fuzzier as phones are not only taken everywhere, but are also worn everywhere, for easy access at any time. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association says that more than 92 million people now have mobile phone service in the United States.</p>
        <p>''The idea of work and home is already largely gone,'' said Philip E. Agre, a professor of information studies at the University of California at Los Angeles. The same principle, Dr. Agre said in an interview via his cell phone (though not a wearable one), can be extended to spaces like cars and sidewalks. As he stood in a Los Angeles taco bar, he managed to order a burrito and talk on the phone at the same time.</p>
        <p>Feeling self-conscious about those blurring lines, people using cell phones are trying to find ways to achieve privacy in public, often while still holding conversations a decibel above the norm. A woman on 6th Avenue and 43rd Street last Thursday, for example, held a phone to her face using one hand and held a crumpled tissue in the other. She had turned her tear-stained face to the wall of the building. Nearby, a man stepped into an alley just before screaming obscenities into his phone, words that could still be heard clearly many steps away.</p>
        <p>Wearers of headsets and ear pieces may need to create different social cues. They need signals to indicate when they are talking to people who are nowhere to be seen and when they have come down to earth to interact with the people around them.</p>
        <p>Valerie Barnwell, who works at the Starbucks at 44th Street and Lexington Avenue, said she was once trying to make sense of a customer's confusing order when he stopped in midsentence and said, ''Hold on, I'm in Starbucks.'' Then he made a comprehensible request for a drink and shifted back into his former conversation, without any external sign that he was on the phone.</p>
        <p>''I think people may have a strong reaction to people wearing these things all over the place,'' said Susan Squires, an anthropologist who is studying variations in cell-phone behavior for GVO, a product-research company in Palo Alto, Calif. Society will have to learn that wearers of ear pieces are not people who, as Dr. Squires delicately put it, ''are having auditory hallucinations.''</p>
        <p>Ear bud and microphone users sometimes try to signal to others that they are on the phone, putting the handset on a restaurant table in full view, for example, or holding the microphone wire as they walk, no longer, strictly speaking, hands-free. Jon Geist, a guitar teacher who was recently spotted walking around the Flatiron District wearing his phone, said he thinks people are getting used to the sight of him involved in conversation. ''I usually just smile as if to say, look I'm not a lunatic, I'm on the telephone,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''We drive other people crazy,'' said J. Anthony Wade, an account manager for AT&amp;T's wireless division who uses earbuds, ''but it's better than me holding my hand up  all the time.''</p>
        <p>Other earbud users retain some of the unconscious, privacy-seeking behavior that they learned from using a regular cell phone: At Grand Central Terminal a few weeks ago, a management consultant from Boulder named Sandy Keziah had turned away from the crowds to use his hands-free system. He leaned his shoulder against a marble wall as he began to speak, his face so close to the cool surface he could have kissed it.</p>
        <p>Wearable phones will also have to pass the trendiness test before they gain popularity in the United States. Which is more of a status symbol: wearing tiny ear buds and a gadget on your waist or carrying a phone that all can see? In New York, among the hundreds of stylish and toned 20-somethings who gathered at an outdoor cafe in Union Square on a recent Thursday evening, not one could be seen wearing a headset or ear piece. Almost all had a cell phone in hand, thumb often poised to take a call.</p>
        <p>Among younger crowds, however, Dr. Squires sees some hints that hands-free cell phones may catch on. Her research among American teenagers has shown that many of them are not happy with the idea of constantly carrying a cell phone, because it reminds them of their lack of time spent talking face to face with Mom and Dad, who are often on their phones while transporting their children. ''They see the cell phone as business-oriented and cutting into their ability to interact with their parents,'' Dr. Squires said. So if the phone were ''disguised'' or designed as something to be worn, she said, it might be more palatable to the future cell phone set.</p>
        <p>Better yet, she said, if a day arrives when earphones for music are meshed with ear buds for cell phones, teenagers will probably adopt them in droves. Since cell phones are already being sold with Web access, and MP3 music files are shared on the Web, that combination may not be far away.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Macias, the college student strolling around Grand Central last week, it could not come soon enough. While the ear bud for his cell phone was in his left ear, his right ear was occupied as well. It held an earphone that connected him to the silver CD player in his hands. ''I'm listening to Eminem's new album, but I can still be on the phone,'' he said, grinning. Then he turned and headed up Lexington Avenue, his head full of hip-hop rhymes, remote conversations and maybe the faint rhythm of the city.</p>

        <p>The Locator  The Locator, found on the street or the train, in buses and airports, is compelled to explain exactly where he is calling from. Sometimes that seems to be the only purpose of the call.</p>
        <p>The Mobile Office Mate  This is the office mate you didn't know you had until she sat down next to you. For her, all the world's an office, and you are just part of the furniture.</p>
        <p>The Sharer  Some things are private to most of the people most of the time. Not to the Sharer, who imagines that cell phones come with a built in cone of silence. He suffers from privacy deficit disorder.</p>
