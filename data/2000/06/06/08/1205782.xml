        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The essay about an attempt to give up print newspapers in favor of news online underscores why the Web plays an intrinsically different role than the Web as a mass medium. The Web is not for reading. The Web is for using.</p>
        <p>Until the media-minded understand that content on the Internet means more than the text and images of traditional media, it won't get it. Content on the Web is about what's on the page and the relationship between the individual and that information.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The essay about an attempt to give up print newspapers in favor of news online underscores why the Web plays an intrinsically different role than the Web as a mass medium. The Web is not for reading. The Web is for using.</p>
        <p>Until the media-minded understand that content on the Internet means more than the text and images of traditional media, it won't get it. Content on the Web is about what's on the page and the relationship between the individual and that information.</p>
        <p>Never before has the public had within a few minutes' reach both the sources of information and the interpretation.</p>
        <p>Both raw information (government reports, etc.) and the work of journalists (the informed who place data in context) are accessible on the Web.</p>
        <p>The Web will be the lowest common denominator because it's an affordable medium with worldwide reach that is becoming standard in schools, homes, businesses and public areas like libraries and airports.</p>
