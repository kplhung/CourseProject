        <p>Following is a transcript of the opening statement by William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, at a news conference yesterday in Redmond, Wash., as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>I'm reminded of the old saying that today is the first day of the rest of your life. I believe very strongly that today is the first day of the rest of this case.</p>

        <p>Following is a transcript of the opening statement by William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, at a news conference yesterday in Redmond, Wash., as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>I'm reminded of the old saying that today is the first day of the rest of your life. I believe very strongly that today is the first day of the rest of this case.</p>
        <p>The central issue here is a disagreement between ourselves and the Department of Justice over whether we should have been allowed to support the Internet inside Microsoft Windows. Our inclusion of that support in an integrated way did nothing to exclude Netscape or any other competitor from distributing and improving their technology. In fact, as the court found, Netscape distributed over 160 million copies of its browser in 1998 alone.</p>
        <p>The government's position here on the specific of the browser and on the general question of improving products really flies in the face of the kind of improvements that have benefited consumers from innovation coming out of the technology industry. So today's ruling really represents an unwarranted and unjustified intrusion into the software marketplace, a marketplace that has been an engine of economic growth for America. This ruling would provide that the Internet support in Windows could never be enhanced, it could never be updated to new standards whether they relate to privacy or XML or any other consumer needs. This ruling says to creators of intellectual property that the government can take away what you created if it turns out to be too popular.</p>
        <p>We will be exercising our right to appeal this decision, and we're confident the judicial system will overturn today's ruling. We will also seek a stay of this order so the appeal can move forward without any unnecessary harm to Microsoft and to consumers through the delay or interference with our work on new products.</p>
        <p>I want to make it clear that the Microsoft team worked very hard to try and settle the issues in this case without the need for additional litigation. I also want to make sure that people understand that during the appeal we'll continue to do what we do best, which is building new software. We have many reasons to be confident in our appeal. For example, the ruling is directly inconsistent, as the district court acknowledges, with the appeals court ruling on exactly this topic that was made earlier.</p>
        <p>Also, it's an unreasonable thing to call to break up Microsoft and create these regulatory provisions about how software should be defined. I also think if you just step back from this and look at the paradigm shifts taking place today and the very intense competition in our business, what's being said today flies in the face of the innovation and low prices that consumers are seeing every day, low prices that really arise out of the PC industry and the values that we brought as one of the companies that really fostered the entire PC phenomenon.</p>
        <p>So we have strong legal, factual and procedural arguments. The court adopted the government's plan to break up and regulate Microsoft without a single day of testimony. Microsoft asked for a reasonable opportunity to respond to the government's unprecedented plan, but we were denied that right.</p>
        <p>Here at Microsoft we've assembled a world-class team. For 25 years, that team has brought widespread benefits to the economy and to consumers. We have very exciting plans for that team including things like a breakthrough user interface that involves handwriting and speech recognition. These are efforts that can only be done by a large company with a total focus on taking its R&amp;D and moving those into products. Keeping our team together as one Microsoft is critical to our efforts.</p>
        <p>The values that have guided our efforts throughout our entire history include competing hard, but competing fairly; listening to customers and innovating to meet their needs; and partnering with literally thousands of companies in the hardware, software and services businesses to make our vision of low-cost computing a reality and a reality that has moved forward faster than any sector of the economy. We've got a lot of great new ideas and great new products we're working on for the months and years ahead. In particular we're very excited about the vision of a next generation of services delivered through the Internet. The Internet, as powerful as it is today, can be made easier and far more effective for both consumers and businesses.</p>
        <p>We recognize that as an industry leader we have grave responsibilities in working inside our business. And we accept that. While we disagree with the government on this specific issue, I want to make clear that we respect the role of government and our legal and economic system. And we will, of course, abide by any final judgments reached in this case. We continue to work on a very positive basis with federal and state officials. In fact, just yesterday I was in Washington, D.C., discussing with a great number of legislators issues like improving technology in education, bridging the digital divide and important legislation like that upcoming digital signature bill.</p>
        <p>So in conclusion, today is the start of a new phase of this case, a phase where we'll get review by a higher court. We're confident that the courts will overturn what's happened at the district level. And as the legal team works to resolve this, we're going to focus our energy on building great software for all our customers.</p>
