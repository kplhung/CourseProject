        <p>With his peripheral vision, Carl Pavano could see Yankees scurrying from corner to corner, but he could not catch them. The bases were infested with base-stealers, and the Montreal pitcher tried, stepping off the pitching rubber and threatening them. Sometimes he just held the ball and hoped they'd stop.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees kept running tonight, swiping five bases and changing the basic dynamic of this game early, then going on to win, 7-2. After his team's six-run rally in the fifth inning, Orlando Hernandez breezed to his sixth victory, allowing four hits and three walks in eight innings.</p>
        <p>The Yankees won four of six games on this road trip, playing the Atlanta Braves and the Expos. Over their last eight games, they are batting .317 with 32 extra-base hits, and averaging 6.1 runs a game. They will begin a three-game series against the Mets at Yankee Stadium Friday night.</p>
        <p>As spring training began, Manager Joe Torre met with his new first-base coach, Lee Mazzilli, and pushed him to push the Yankees' base runners, who were somewhat lax in 1999, sometimes failing to recognize opportunities to run. Mazzilli had played for Torre with the Mets and was adept at stealing bases. ''Give them your mind and their bodies,'' Torre told Mazzilli.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have run more this year, though with mixed results in late April and into early May; after 34 games, the Yankees had 21 steals, but had been thrown out 16 times. But in the last 21 games, it's as if they've become mind readers, swiping 24 bases in 26 attempts.</p>
        <p>What the Yankees knew about Pavano was that he could be slow in his delivery to home plate -- 1.3 seconds at his quickest. Ricky Ledee led off the game with a single, took a lead. Mazzilli carries a stopwatch and times pitchers, and Pavano was registering 1.5 or 1.6 seconds. Pedestrian.</p>
        <p>''I know it took a while for me to get to the plate tonight,'' Pavano said later. ''I got the impression the last couple of starts that guys are really starting to run on my delivery.''</p>
        <p>The only way Pavano could have been rescued from the fate he invited was if he had been paired with a strong-armed catcher. But Charlie O'Brien turned 40 years old last month and is closing in on the end of his career. As respected as he is for his ability to handle pitchers, age has drained his arm strength and weakened his throws. It was a mismatch.</p>
        <p>Clay Bellinger reached first leading off the third inning when Pavano grazed his left hand with a fastball. El Duque batted in an obvious bunt situation. Lee Stevens, the Montreal first baseman, charged on the third pitch -- the Yankees were playing  hit-and-run -- and Bellinger broke for second.</p>
        <p>O'Brien caught a fastball high and outside, a perfect pitch for a throw to second, but the Montreal catcher bounced the ball 20 feet short of second base. Bellinger had gotten a huge jump, but O'Brien's poor throw was an open invitation for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''We want to run,'' Derek Jeter said. ''We may not have the fastest guys, but we're capable of stealing bases.''</p>
        <p>Ledee singled with two out to score Bellinger, before Ledee swiped second. Bernie Williams singled and stole second in the fourth inning.</p>
        <p>But Montreal led by 2-1 after four innings, and with one out in the fifth, Ledee chopped a routine grounder to shortstop, where Geoff Blum fielded cleanly, set himself and threw high and wide, an error. On the first pitch to Jeter, Ledee was running, and Jeter grounded a single between the middle infielders as Ledee motored into third.</p>
        <p>On the first pitch to Paul O'Neill, Jeter was running, and O'Neill smashed a single to left-center; Ledee scored, Jeter trotted into third.</p>
        <p>Pavano kept throwing to first base, trying to hold the runners, but so long as he delivered the ball so deliberately, there was nothing he could do; the Yankees were on the move. O'Neill swiped second, and he and Jeter scored when Williams singled to center.</p>
        <p>Pavano could have been out of the inning, but Tino Martinez drove the ball against the fence in left-center, a triple, Martinez's fourth of the year.</p>
        <p>Montreal Manager Felipe Alou ambled out of the dugout, calling for Mike Johnson, and when Jorge Posada smashed Johnson's second pitch for a two-run homer, the Yankees led, 7-2, having scored six runs with six batters, aided by Mazzilli's mind and their bodies.</p>
        <p>''I was very pleased with the way we played tonight,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Alou said: ''They probably could've stolen 10 bases tonight.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>DAVID CONE will pitch Sunday's game against the Mets. . . . The pain in CHUCK KNOBLAUCH's bruised left forearm persists, and if the second baseman doesn't improve in the next two days, he could be placed on the disabled list. . . . SCOTT BROSIUS, the 34-year-old third baseman, left Linfield College (Ore.) in 1987 needing 25 credits for his general business degree. He intends to take correspondence classes this summer and begin to get the necessary hours of course study.</p>
