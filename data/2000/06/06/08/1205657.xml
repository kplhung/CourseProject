        <p>AS the Microsoft Corporation assesses the implications of the breakup ordered yesterday by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, the advice from professional communicators on how the company ought to handle the consequences is being offered almost as quickly as the ''I Love You'' computer worm infested e-mail in-boxes.</p>

        <p>AS the Microsoft Corporation assesses the implications of the breakup ordered yesterday by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, the advice from professional communicators on how the company ought to handle the consequences is being offered almost as quickly as the ''I Love You'' computer worm infested e-mail in-boxes.</p>
        <p>Microsoft ''should turn it into a political issue and go right over the heads of the politicians and appeal to their bosses: the taxpayers, the voters,'' said Richard Laermer, chief executive at RLM Public Relations in New York, which represents several technology companies.</p>
        <p>''Then it could be the 'Isn't that what America is all about' angle, free enterprise, the melting pot, opportunity,'' he added, ''and it becomes emotional. Pull the heartstrings and keep positioning Microsoft as the underdog against the mean guys. Everyone roots for the underdog.''</p>
        <p>But could Microsoft be successfully spun as an underdog?</p>
        <p>''In an environment where everyone is so cynical about Microsoft,'' the public perceives the company's leaders ''as insincere, even though I don't believe they are,'' said Trish Adams, account director at Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore. She worked on the Microsoft account when Wieden &amp; Kennedy was a principal Microsoft agency.</p>
        <p>Rather than use Microsoft's top managers to respond to the ruling, Ms. Adams said, ''I'd be much more likely to put more 'real people' on the air: the people who are the workhorses, the people who really believe in the company.''</p>
        <p>''Having worked with them, I know those people still see themselves as working for a small, scrappy company,'' she added, ''and believe what they do is best for consumers. The other approach would do more damage than good.''</p>
        <p>Some executives, however, said they thought no amount of spin control could overcome Microsoft's difficulties.</p>
        <p>''I would say it's a bit late,'' said Chris Wall, executive creative director on the I.B.M. account at the New York office of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group. ''You can't undo years of neglect with a couple of ads.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft executives ''have tried in fits and starts to humanize their image,'' Mr. Wall said -- referring to steps like having William H. Gates, the company's chairman, appear on television programs and in commercials -- ''but they have not been terribly evangelical'' in disseminating their point of view and ''a 'take no prisoners' attitude is coming back to bite them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wall, who was creative director on the Microsoft account at Wieden &amp; Kennedy, said he admired the company because when ''it got powerful, it didn't get fat but kept focused.''</p>
        <p>''But Microsoft has not made a compelling public case for what is the truth,'' he asserted, ''that it works in an industry fueled by change and innovation and in a way it is under threat now more than ever, from Unix and Linux.''</p>
        <p>''Apple Computer has shown that you can be very focused on margins and at the same time project a benevolent image,'' Mr. Wall said.</p>
        <p>''Maybe Microsoft should talk to Steve Jobs,'' he added, referring to the Apple co-founder and chief executive. That would not be too difficult to arrange; Microsoft owns a small stake in Apple.</p>
        <p>''Whatever happens, Bill Gates should become a student of Richard Nixon,'' said Ed Gyurko, president at Smart P.R. in New York, an agency specializing in technology clients.</p>
        <p>''Nixon was pilloried,'' Mr. Gyurko said, recalling the resignation in the face of impeachment over Watergate, ''but then he redeemed himself and carved out a new role as a pundit and statesman.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates ''could become a guru for business,'' Mr. Gyurko suggested, ''taking what he does best and reversing the bad karma.''</p>
        <p>What might Microsoft actually do in the wake of the antitrust ruling? Its current agency, McCann-Erickson/A&amp;L, which replaced Wieden &amp; Kennedy on the account, is mum for now.</p>
        <p>Stewart Alter, a spokesman in New York for McCann-Erickson/ A&amp;L, declined to comment on what plans were being formulated. The agency is part of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising unit of the McCann-Erickson World Group; McCann-Erickson is owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>The trade publication Advertising Age reported this week that Microsoft executives were considering ''at least half a dozen advertising possibilities to react immediately'' to the ruling. The options include television commercials, according to the report, that would feature Microsoft senior managers or customers offering testimonials.</p>
