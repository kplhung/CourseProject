        <p>More certain than ever that a pilot deliberately caused the crash of Egyptair 990 as it left New York last October, American investigators are wrapping up their investigation and may approve their conclusions without a public hearing.</p>
        <p>This unusual approach is meant to avoid further damage to relations with Egypt, which have been strained by the inquiry, government officials say.</p>
        <p>But the Egyptian government, which has resisted the theory that the crash was caused by a suicidal pilot, has developed a competing theory, that the plane, a Boeing 767, developed a mechanical problem in its tail, a problem that has been seen on 767's operated by AeroMexico and other airlines. None of those planes has crashed. All 217 people aboard Egyptair 990 died when it plunged into the Atlantic off Cape Cod on Oct. 31.</p>
        <p>The Egyptian theory has been informally rejected by experts at the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates crashes,  but Egypt is pressing its case. On Tuesday, the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority asked the Federal Aviation Administration, which is in charge of safety regulation, to begin an investigation of the suspect part, and to order all airlines to conduct daily inspections of the tail to screen for the kind of failure the Egyptian agency says may have brought down Flight 990. The F.A.A. has not made a decision on the request.</p>
        <p>The Egyptian theory was developed with help from a phalanx of American aviation experts who are retired from the Safety Board or the F.A.A. It involves the controls on the two elevator panels, the movable surfaces on the horizontal tail that point the plane's nose up or down.</p>
        <p>Each panel is controlled by three actuators, for a total of six. Salvagers have recovered four actuators from the ocean bottom. One of those actuators bears marks that the Egyptians argue show that it malfunctioned. In a presentation to the Safety Board in April, they argued that if a second actuator on the same elevator had also failed, the plane's nose would have suddenly been forced down. The flight data recorder from Flight 990 showed that the plane was proceeding in level flight until it dived.</p>
        <p>But American investigators say the marks are not a sign of malfunction and could have been caused by the plane's impact on the water.  They say that even if two actuators  failed and forced the elevator down, engineering studies performed at Boeing's simulator in Seattle showed that the crew could have recovered from the resulting nose dive.</p>
        <p>American investigators say they suspect suicide because the flight data recorder, an advanced model, does not give evidence of mechanical malfunction. Nor does the cockpit voice recorder. It does record the first officer uttering what the Americans, but not the Egyptians, regard as a final prayer. Then it records the captain, who investigators think had left the cabin, returning and forcefully asking his first officer what was going on. During the dive, someone turned off the engines, an action not called for by emergency procedures, the Americans say.</p>
        <p>Finally, the flight data recorder shows that after a long dive, the elevators pointed in opposite directions, a sign that the two men were working their controls in opposite directions, American investigators say.</p>
        <p>But the Egyptians have argued that a pilot who intended to crash his plane would not have put it into a dive, from which another crew member might have rescued it. More likely, they have said, such a pilot would try to roll the plane upside down. And they have argued to the Safety Board that although engineers in a simulator could recover from the dive, a crew startled by a sudden malfunction while flying over the ocean at night might not be so skilled.</p>
        <p>The five-member Safety Board tries jealously to maintain a monopoly on public statements about investigations in progress, and, as a result, people involved in the investigation were not willing to be identified.</p>
        <p>But some American investigators are frustrated that the inquiry, which the Egyptian government delegated to the United States, has not been completed. As one said, in investigations of domestic crashes, each party has a ''constituency,'' because each represents the airline, or the plane manufacturer, but, he said, ''usually you want to solve it.''</p>
        <p>In this case, said the investigator, the Egyptians ''don't care about solving it; they want to cover themselves.''</p>
        <p>The Egyptians, on the other side, have complained about what they call a ''rush to judgment.''</p>
        <p>Airlines often hire retired government investigators to help with safety problems, but Egyptair has assembled a particularly distinguished crew: Carl W. Vogt, a former chairman of the Safety Board; a retired deputy chief of aviation safety; a retired top metallurgist from the Safety Board; and a former F.A.A. chief accident investigator.</p>
