        <p>Julio Cesar Chavez will haul his battleworn body into a ring at a Phoenix arena next month to fight once again for the junior-welterweight belt he once owned when he was young. Chavez, 37, will face Kostya Tszyu, a Russian-born champion seven years his junior who has a powerful right hand and has knocked out most of his opponents.</p>
        <p>Many people predict that the bout can be disastrous for Chavez. Senator John McCain, a frequent critic of boxing, has written a letter to Arizona's governor, Jane Dee Hull, calling the bout ''an illegitimate and potentially dangerous mismatch.'' The Association of Boxing Commissions has said the match ''raised more than a few eyebrows when it was announced.'' The Nevada Athletic Commission has refused to let the match be held in that state, saying Chavez could be seriously injured.</p>
        <p>Even officials at Showtime, which is televising the match, acknowledge it is not likely to be a good fight and could become a bloodbath.</p>
        <p>''I'm not at all happy about it,'' said Jay Larkin, a vice president at Showtime. ''I don't think Chavez should be the No. 1 contender.''</p>
        <p>So why is it happening?</p>
        <p>The answer is that despite recent efforts by Congress and federal prosecutors to clean up boxing, the sport remains in the thrall of sanctioning bodies that rank fighters arbitrarily and hand out championship belts like costume jewelry.</p>
        <p>The fight is what is known as a mandatory bout. Under the rules of the major sanctioning bodies, a champion must fight the No. 1 contender once a year or forfeit his belt. If the rankings were logical and objective, such rules would ensure that champions do not duck tough opponents. But the rankings are neither logical nor objective, critics say.</p>
        <p>''A mismatch in boxing is not an unusual thing,'' Larkin said. ''It happens more often than not.''</p>
        <p>Chavez, who has a 103-4 record in a career that has spanned two decades, has remained the No. 1 contender in the World Boxing Council ranking despite a lackluster record in recent years. He has not fought any fighter rated in the top 10 of any weight class in the past year. His last serious fight was in October, when Willy Wise, a journeyman welterweight not ranked in the top 10, soundly defeated him. Chavez failed to answer the bell in the ninth round.</p>
        <p>What is more, the Mexican boxing hero has remained the top contender in the junior-welterweight class (140 pounds), even though he has not fought at that weight since March 1998. Jose Sulaiman, the president of the W.B.C., acknowledges that Chavez's No. 1 ranking had more to do with his legendary stature among Mexican fans than with his recent performances. The W.B.C. is based in Mexico. Sulaiman said he had urged Chavez to retire, but Chavez has pleaded with the W.B.C. for one more chance to regain a championship belt before he quits.</p>
        <p>''He's been such a hero in my country that I want him to retire with dignity and honor,'' Sulaiman said. ''I don't say he's the super giant of the moment, but he deserves the opportunity.''</p>
        <p>There is another, less romantic reason why Chavez is the top challenger, Sulaiman said.</p>
        <p>''Chavez is a big draw,'' he said. ''I assure you Mexican television will pay a million dollars for the fight.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Chavez has said he wants one more chance to redeem himself in the eyes of his fans and retire a champion. He also has said he would like to cement his place in boxing history as one of the greatest Latino fighters.</p>
        <p>''This will be my last fight,'' Chavez said before the Arizona Boxing Commission on Friday. ''Let me go out with dignity and honor.''</p>
        <p>After hearing more than 90 minutes of testimony and Chavez's impassioned plea on Friday, the three-man Arizona commission voted to grant him a license to fight in that state, clearing the way for the July 29 bout. Tickets are already on sale. Both fighters will get $1.2 million for appearing.</p>
        <p>Tszyu, a 30-year-old Russian, defected to Australia during the 1991 world amateur tournament in Sydney, after he became the amateur world champion at 140 pounds and attracted the attention of Australian promoters. Since then, he has won 23 professional fights with a straightahead style and a powerful right hand, knocking out 21 of those opponents. He lost once, to Vince Phillips, in May 1997.</p>
        <p>Officials at Showtime maintain that they can do nothing to stop the fight. The cable network has a contract with Tszyu to televise whichever bout the W.B.C. mandates he must fight to keep his belt.</p>
        <p>John Montano, the executive director of the Arizona Boxing Commission, said Chavez had passed a physical examination with the state's ringside physician, Dr. Robin MacDougal, and underwent a battery of neurological tests, which showed nothing abnormal. The fighter also provided the commission with an M.R.I. scan of his brain done in Mexico.</p>
        <p>''I don't see any reason not to hold the fight,'' Montano said last week. ''There is nothing in the medicals to preclude him from fighting.''</p>
        <p>The three members of the Arizona Boxing Commission are appointees of Hull. She did not take a public position on the fight, but she requested the commissioners to take McCain's concerns into account, a spokeswoman for the governor's office, Francie Noyes, said.</p>
        <p>Questions about this match are being raised against a backdrop of efforts to clean up boxing.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, the founder of the International Boxing Federation is on trial, accused by federal prosecutors of regularly taking bribes to manipulate rankings. A court-appointed monitor is overseeing the organization, which is the only major sanctioning body in the United States.</p>
        <p>And last week, Congress passed the Muhammed Ali Boxing Reform Act, a raft of measures that require more financial disclosure by promoters and sanctioning organizations. The law is intended to make it more difficult for promoters to exploit fighters and for sanctioning organizations to accept kickbacks and bribes disguised as legitimate payments.</p>
        <p>One of the act's provisions also encourages state commissions to adopt uniform rating criteria for boxers. Under the law, the Association of Boxing Commissions would set national guidelines for ratings, though it has yet to do so.</p>
        <p>Greg Sirb, the Pennsylvania commissioner and the president of the association, said it was unlikely that Chavez's ranking would be approved if the new regulations were in place. ''If we had them already set, I don't think you would see Chavez as the No. 1 contender,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Chavez's defenders point out that other former champions said to be past their prime have pulled upset victories over younger fighters. George Foreman, for instance, stunned Michael Moorer in the 10th round in late 1994 and won the I.B.F. heavyweight belt.</p>
        <p>''Chavez is not the fighter that he was 10 or 15 years ago, but 50 percent of Chavez is still better than most of the fighters in that division,'' said Don Majewski, the matchmaker for Millennium Promotions, the Australian company that promotes Tszyu.</p>
