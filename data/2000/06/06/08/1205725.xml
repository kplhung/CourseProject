        <p>Perhaps one of these seasons Martin Brodeur will step onto the ice at Madison Square Garden and not hear Stephane Matteau catcalls.</p>
        <p>Matteau's goal, of course, will forever live in Ranger fans' memories. His shot eluded Brodeur at 4 minutes 24 seconds of double overtime of Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals in 1994, and propelled the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup in 54 years. After one of his poor performances against the Philadelphia Flyers, Brodeur was asked if one of the soft goals he allowed was as devastating as the one to Matteau.</p>
        <p>''Every time I go to Madison Square Garden I hear someone mention the guy's name,'' Brodeur said of Matteau, now a member of the San Jose Sharks. ''I don't even know where the guy's playing now.''</p>
        <p>Brodeur recovered from Matteau's goal to lead the Devils to the Stanley Cup a year later. On Thursday night, Brodeur and the Devils have a chance to win another cup with a victory over the Dallas Stars.</p>
        <p>Brodeur has been terrific in the series with a 1.75 goals against average. One of his numerous strengths is what the golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez calls ''instant amnesia'' after a bad shot. If he has a bad game, he forgets about it and looks ahead to the next game.</p>
        <p>''I've been with him for seven years,'' Jacques Caron, the goaltending coach of the Devils, said today, ''and I've learned that his mental strength is unbelievable. He recovers well from a bad game.''</p>
        <p>Brodeur has had a handful of stressful moments against the Stars. In Game 3, with the Devils holding a 2-1 lead, he was assessed a delay-of-game penalty with 4:15 remaining.</p>
        <p>''Marty didn't think my hair was gray enough,'' Coach Larry Robinson said. Brodeur redeemed himself with 50 seconds left in the game, however, when he denied Brett Hull.</p>
        <p>''When I saw him with the puck, I said, 'Anybody but him,' '' Brodeur said about Hull, who scored the winning goal in Game 2. ''I didn't want to have to face him like that because I know the kind of shot he's got.''</p>
        <p>Today at practice the Devils were looking to close out the championship series. Standing on a small platform, Sergei Brylin reminded listeners what the Devils accomplished after facing elimination three times against the Flyers.</p>
        <p>''Dallas can do what we did in the last series,'' Brylin said. ''I know it's difficult to concentrate on the game and not think about the Stanley Cup, but we know what we have to do.''</p>
        <p>Claude Lemieux said, ''You focus on what you have to do to get it, rather than what to do after you get it.'' Lemieux speaks from experience. He won the Stanley Cup with the Devils in 1995 and again a year later with the Colorado Avalanche. He won his first cup with the Montreal Canadiens as a rookie in 1986.</p>
        <p>''Everybody in the dressing room knows they'll have to play their best game of the series,'' Brodeur said. ''I feel pretty good about the way I'm playing personally, but it's the team that counts.''</p>
        <p>Caron said: ''Marty wants to be the best, but that's not his focus right now. What he wants more than anything now is to win the next game.''</p>
        <p>Including the regular season and the playoffs, Brodeur has 58 victories this season, which ties Mike Richter's mark with the Rangers in 1994. Brodeur needs to win one more game to tie the league record for victories in a season with 59, accomplished by Bernie Parent of the Flyers in 1974.</p>
        <p>With these credentials, perhaps Brodeur will finally get some respect from the hockey fans in the metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>JASON ARNOTT took part in the full practice with the Devils Wednesday and will play Thursday. ''He skated well,'' Coach LARRY ROBINSON said. Arnott was whacked in the face by DARIEN HATCHER in Game 4 and there was concern that he might have suffered a concussion. He did, however, lose six teeth from the bridge in his mouth.</p>
