        <p>It was the final Wednesday at the French Open. Magnus Norman and Marat Safin were on center court, playing a high-velocity, high-reward game of ''Can you top this?'' in the men's quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>They scrapped and lunged and shouted into the sky at the tennis fates. Safin, only 20, smashed rackets to the clay in frustration, as the shots that had been working so well for the past six weeks consistently misfired.</p>
        <p>''First of all, I was nervous,'' he said afterward. ''First time in a quarterfinal, big chance to get in semis and unfortunately you start to think about all these things.''</p>
        <p>Norman, as he closed out his impressive, grown-up 6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 7-5 victory, was certainly doing some thinking of his own as he chased down Safin's increasingly desperate bolts, pumping his fists when he succeeded.</p>
        <p>''I was nervous, just as nervous as he was,'' Norman said. ''But I've come so far now with my tennis and played a lot of crucial matches, so I'm getting experience now, and I know how to handle situations like this a bit better than I might have.''</p>
        <p>It takes so much work to get to a Grand Slam quarterfinal. Day after day of hitting forehands cross-court and serves to the corner with no crowd to appreciate the incremental improvements; year after year of minor tournaments, hard choices and budget hotels. And even when you do make it, after all that, there is no guarantee the public will appreciate you.</p>
        <p>Consider Norman. He has all the moves -- the big groundstrokes, the big serve, the proper footwork and the ability to push forward to the net when the pressure is greatest to resolve the conflict with a proper volley.</p>
        <p>He won five tournaments last year, reached his first Grand Slam semifinal at the Australian Open last January and beat Gustavo Kuerten to win the Italian Open last month to take the lead in the yearlong points race. Now, he is in the semifinals at Roland Garros, but neither his fellow Swedes nor the Parisians have taken Norman to heart.</p>
        <p>Not yet at least. But it bears remembering that Mats Wilander, Bjorn Borg and Stefan Edberg also had to build a following and a name for themselves. Norman, a 24-year-old from Filipstad, might not have the innate charisma of the Williams sisters or John McEnroe or even Safin.</p>
        <p>''He's a great guy to watch playing tennis,'' Norman said of Safin. ''You never know what is going to happen. He can hit an ace and the next time the racket is in two pieces. The tour needs a lot of those players as well, not boring like me who doesn't show any emotion.''</p>
        <p>But Norman, who is something of a hothead by Swedish standards, is doing fine, as that wonderfully self-deprecating comment makes clear. On Friday, he will get a chance to keep building against Franco Squillari, an unseeded left-hander from Argentina with a wicked inside-out forehand, who jerked Albert Costa from corner to corner in the first quarterfinal today.</p>
        <p>Squillari defeated Costa, 6-4, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, to become the first Argentine in the semifinals at Roland Garros since Jose-Luis Clerc and Guillermo Vilas advanced that far in 1982. Vilas belongs to the same Buenos Aires club as Squillari, and both he and Clerc were in the center-court stands to watch Squillari join their illustrious company.</p>
        <p>''I was too young to watch Vilas when he was playing at the top,'' said Squillari, who is 23. ''So I specifically watched videos about his game, especially when he played Davis Cup in Argentina. I also watched other left-handers.''</p>
        <p>Two of his film favorites are Andres Gomez and Thomas Muster, both of whom won this tournament in the 1990's. Costa, a Spaniard who had beaten Squillari in their previous three matches, thinks Squillari could be ready to make a highlight reel of his own.</p>
        <p>''I knew his game really well, but he never played like that before,'' Costa said. ''The style was the same, but the level was very, very different. Sure, he can win the tournament. At this stage anyone can win, and though the favorite is Norman, if he plays like that, forget it.''</p>
        <p>Squillari is one of two South Americans in the final four this year. The other is Kuerten of Brazil, who will face Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain in the other semifinal Friday.</p>
