        <p>The Web has made it easier to track down used books, but not without a price, according to a study by two Ohio University professors.</p>
        <p>The survey of 189 booksellers who listed their products with the Advanced Book Exchange found that 34 percent charged higher prices to customers arriving on the Web instead of through the front door. ''Everyone assumes when you go online, the prices will be cheaper,'' said one of the researchers, Phyllis Bernt, a professor of communication systems management. ''But by having access to a world of buyers, the used-book seller is in a much better pricing position for items that are unique.'' She did the study with her husband, Joseph, an associate professor of journalism.</p>
        <p>Prices vary according to the type of book, the study found. Low-end books, like recent mass market romance paperbacks, are all but unavailable on the Web because postage costs generally exceed their value, Phyllis Bernt said. The prices of books that are desirable but commonly available have either remained stable or fallen because of Web sales, the Bernts found. But there has been a big impact on books that are hard to find.</p>
        <p>A small minority of respondents, 1.7 percent, said they believed that the Web had raised prices for used books by as much as 200 percent. ''I suspect it will become increasingly difficult to find books at what we now regard as reasonable prices,'' Joseph Bernt said.</p>
