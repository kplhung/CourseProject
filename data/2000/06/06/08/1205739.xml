        <p>As feuds between players and managers go, the one that has boiled over between Sammy Sosa and Don Baylor could be the most intriguing since Reggie Jackson and Billy Martin.</p>
        <p>But Andy MacPhail, the president of the team they work for, the Chicago Cubs, said yesterday he did not see this feud becoming disruptive to the Cubs' chances of getting back into the National League Central race.</p>
        <p>''It's a relationship thing,'' MacPhail said by telephone from Chicago. ''I think they'll be able to sort through whatever issues there may be without much difficulty.''</p>
        <p>Sosa, the biggest name in Chicago baseball, has spoken out the past two days about what he sees as unfair criticism that Baylor leveled at him indirectly when he was named manager of the Cubs last November. Baylor said at the time he wanted to see Sosa be more than a home run hitter. He said he should try to become a more complete player, playing better defense in the outfield and stealing bases more frequently.</p>
        <p>''You don't criticize a player who comes here every day and plays hard,'' Sosa said yesterday at Wrigley Field before the Cubs defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks for the third time in three games.</p>
        <p>In interviews with reporters from The Chicago Tribune and The Chicago Sun-Times the previous day, Sosa said Baylor had not treated ''me the way I'm supposed to be treated.'' He added that Baylor ''has got no class.''</p>
        <p>The celebrated outfielder, who hit 129 home runs in 1998 and '99, was apparently prompted to speak out after it was suggested in a column in The Tribune on Sunday that the Cubs would be wise to trade Sosa. In the column, a member of the Cubs ''other than Baylor'' criticized Sosa's defense, saying, ''Sammy might drive in 150 runs, but he might let in 45.''</p>
        <p>MacPhail said the Cubs had no intention of trading Sosa. ''Clearly it's not something that has a lot of appeal to me at the present time,'' the Cubs' president said. ''Also Sammy has made it clear he wants to stay here.''</p>
        <p>The Mets and the Yankees are among the teams that have expressed interest in Sosa if the Cubs consider trading him.</p>
        <p>Before yesterday's game, Sosa said he would not initiate a meeting with Baylor, but afterward agreed they should meet.</p>
        <p>''We both need to sit down and talk about it like men,'' Sosa said. ''I'm going to apologize. We both made mistakes.''</p>
        <p>Baylor, who did not return a telephone call seeking comment, said in Chicago that he and Sosa would talk.  ''It's silly,'' the manager said. ''We'll try to get it resolved. We'll talk about it like men, not like children.''  BASEBALL</p>
