        <p>As every parent finds out, children will abandon even the most elaborate and expensive toys to play with one of the following: an old camera, a tape recorder and the box the elaborate and expensive toy came in.</p>
        <p>KB Gear Interactive has heeded the tastes of children with this year's crop of Jam products. JamCam 3.0 is the new version of the company's down-market digital camera. The original JamCam, released in 1998, was a popular alternative for people who did not want to spend a lot of money. It also appealed to those users (children and artists) who did not mind its  low-tech feel and uneven results.</p>
        <p>The resolution on the new $99 JamCam 3.0 is the same as previous models, 640-by-480 pixels, but the company says software enhancements have helped picture quality. The new version also has a built-in flash, a self-timer and a slot for up to 64 megabytes of expandable memory.</p>
        <p>What the JamCam is to pictures, the Jam-It, billed as an inexpensive ''digital sound studio,'' is to sound. The Jam-It ($49) can record up to four minutes of sounds or voices. Once the Jam-It is attached to a PC through the microphone jack, the sounds can be downloaded in Jam-It software, manipulated and converted into sound files that can be sent as attachments to e-mail messages, incorporated into digital images, speeded up, slowed down or synchronized with one of 15 preloaded rhythm tracks. KB Gear has also introduced an MP3 player called the JamP3, at less than $100. It has 16 megabytes of memory but can hold a 64MB card. Like the new JamCam, the Jam-It comes in metallic blue or silver. All three will be available in August.</p>
