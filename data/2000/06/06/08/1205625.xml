        <p>I WAS lucky enough to grow up in New York City, just a few blocks from Museum Mile. My art history classes included weekly visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art; I learned about dinosaurs at the American Museum of Natural History. But while nothing can replace the experience of seeing a masterpiece up close, the Web means that museum education is no longer geographically restricted. Some of the world's most remarkable institutions have Web sites specifically designed for children and schools.</p>
        <p>Art Safari (artsafari.moma.org), a site by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, is by far the most impressive art education site for children that I have seen. (For adults, the MOMA site also has online projects and collaborations with various artists and helpful commentary and information on the museum's exhibitions and collections.)</p>

        <p>I WAS lucky enough to grow up in New York City, just a few blocks from Museum Mile. My art history classes included weekly visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art; I learned about dinosaurs at the American Museum of Natural History. But while nothing can replace the experience of seeing a masterpiece up close, the Web means that museum education is no longer geographically restricted. Some of the world's most remarkable institutions have Web sites specifically designed for children and schools.</p>
        <p>Art Safari (artsafari.moma.org), a site by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, is by far the most impressive art education site for children that I have seen. (For adults, the MOMA site also has online projects and collaborations with various artists and helpful commentary and information on the museum's exhibitions and collections.)</p>
        <p>The online activities provide a virtual experience similar to what a child might have at a weekend museum workshop. Students focus on a selected sculpture or painting from the museum's collection as they answer a series of on-screen questions about each piece. The activity encourages close observation and active imagination. At the end of the sequence of questions, children are asked to create their own masterpiece using the online art tools.</p>
        <p>I picked Picasso's ''She-Goat'' and answered five questions about the sculpture. Afterward, my answers appeared on screen in story form. The site also suggested ways to create my own sculpture using everyday found objects as Picasso did, or using the site's online art program. Using the online tools, I struggled to manipulate the pictures of a bowling pin, a baseball, a spoon, eyeglasses, a hammer and a bowl to form the shape of a cat. The recommended nonvirtual, live project might have been more fun.</p>
        <p>I also did the exercises for works by Frida Kahlo, Henri Rousseau and Diego Rivera. Each has its own online questions and art tools, all of which were easier to use than the Picasso project.</p>
        <p>On the home page of the Natural History Museum in London (www.nhm.ac.uk), I clicked on Interactive and brought up a page with links to eight interactive activities. I visited AntCast and after patiently waiting for the live video stream watched two ants slowly make their way around what looked like a piece of wood. I was not all that interested in watching an English ant go about its daily routine, but my third graders who study ants would have been delighted.</p>
        <p>The Earthlab Datasite, which contains information on fossils, rocks and minerals in Britain, is an extensive and a wonderful resource for a middle school or high school science student.</p>
        <p>Science Casebook has sections on meteorites and speculates on the possibility of a real Jurassic Park. There is also a fascinating account of the Beast of Bodmin Moor, a legendary catlike animal in Cornwall, England.</p>
        <p>Dinosaur-crazed students will find the Dinosaur Data Files and Quest II to be the gems of this extensive site. Educators should find the Dinosaur Data Files, fact sheets on 28 types of dinosaurs, extremely useful. Information on each dinosaur includes its name (and the proper pronunciation of it), origin, size, feeding preferences and other facts.. While the information is designed for the classroom, many of the suggested activities can be used at home.</p>
        <p>In the Quest II section, students can become museum scientists. Online tools and data allow students to examine and draw conclusions about a dozen objects.</p>
        <p>For example, I investigated the physical and historical traits of a butterfly using a virtual magnifying glass and scale. (When finished I could have submitted my notes to be posted on the Web.) After completing my research I clicked on the book icon to learn the full details of my specimen. The language and tools are appropriate for children as young as 8. Quest is available in five languages.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia's Franklin Institute Science Museum (www.fi.edu/) has a fantastic exploration of the human heart, including a tour of valves and arteries using actual photographs and some medical terms that may require a dictionary. Younger users can skip some of the denser biology sections and use the table of contents to go directly to an area of interest.</p>
        <p>The site also has excellent pages on weather, phenomena like volcanoes and earthquakes, a program about early aviation and a large area on Benjamin Franklin. Some sections are a bit text heavy for a child to use independently but are worth a visit.</p>

        <p>REVIEW  Correction:  June 13, 2000, Tuesday  A picture caption in Circuits on Thursday with an article about museum Web sites misidentified a site illustrated with an image of a fish. It was from the Natural History Museum in London, not the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
