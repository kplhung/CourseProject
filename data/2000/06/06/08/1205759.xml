        <p>A Netherlands-based cable television company, United Pan-Europe Communications, will postpone the initial public offering of its high-speed Internet access arm, Chello Broadband, for the second time because it is in ''strategic talks'' that could affect the offering's valuation. According to executives close to the talks, U.P.C. is negotiating with Excite@Home of Redwood, Calif., over a possible joint venture in Europe. U.P.C. is also negotiating to sell a 10 percent stake in Chello to Telewest Communications, a British cable company. In a complex arrangement, U.P.C. would also acquire 24.6 percent of Telewest.</p>
