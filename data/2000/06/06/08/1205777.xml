        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A recent letter to the editor, ''Risks of Hard Drive Backups'' (Incoming, June 1), warned of the dangers of backing up data to a second hard drive. The writer lost a hard drive and two modems because of a major electrical storm. My experience with a recent power interruption (perhaps because of the same storm) is a lesson in the subtleties of surge protection. My computer had the usual surge protector, but the modem was still demolished. Why? Because there was no surge protector on the telephone line coming into the modem.</p>
