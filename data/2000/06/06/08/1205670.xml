        <p>The smile, the jokes and the charitable spirit were all there, but beneath the joyous facade it was easy to see that Jayson Williams was troubled. While announcing at Riverfront Stadium today that his private foundation will hold a benefit softball game July 29, Williams, the Nets' fun-loving center, was struggling with the probability that his National Basketball Association career is over.</p>
        <p>Williams and his agent, Sal DiFazio, refused to say definitely that Williams would never return from the severely broken right leg he sustained in a collision with Stephon Marbury in a game April 1, 1999. But DiFazio sounded as if it would take almost a miracle for Williams, 32, to play again in the N.B.A.</p>
        <p>Williams did not play last season, and DiFazio said he would almost certainly not be able to play next season. DiFazio said a decision on Williams's career would most likely be made within a few weeks, after Williams is further examined.</p>
        <p>''The problem is that there's a structural defect that when he goes out to run and jump and play N.B.A. basketball, the knee is going to swell and become non-usable for the next few days,'' DiFazio said. ''You can't play ball like that. That's the problem. It's the residual arthritis and the residual changes in the knee.</p>
        <p>''Playing golf, jogging around on a tennis court -- he's going to be fine with those things. But N.B.A. basketball is a serious business. These guys go hard, and he probably is never going to have the ability to do that.''</p>
        <p>While doctors said shortly after the injury that Williams's career was in jeopardy, today's news was a bit of a surprise because Williams practiced with the Nets for three days in March. His coaches and teammates said he had looked great before a fracture in his left foot ended his comeback.</p>
        <p>DiFazio said today, however, that the swelling and pain in Williams's knee after those practices was so incredible that he would have had to stop playing even if he had not broken his left foot.</p>
        <p>''His knee blew up to the size of a basketball,'' DiFazio said. ''Unfortunately, those are conditions that are not going to allow him to continue with his career in the N.B.A., if they continue.</p>
        <p>''If what we saw in March is where we are, then we're done and that's pretty much the bottom line. The condition of his knee, where we were in March, is not going to get better. If anything, the arthritis is progressive and will get worse. This is not something that heals. So you can draw your own conclusions based upon what I've told you here today.''</p>
        <p>Though not optimistic, Williams's outlook was not as pessimistic as DiFazio's. He would like to continue rehabilitating his leg before determining his future. But he said he understood that he could not keep the Nets guessing about his availability.</p>
        <p>''I'm still hurting,'' said Williams, who had five screws and a plate inserted in his leg to repair a displaced tibial plateau fracture and partly torn meniscus. ''I'm a 20-Advil-a-day guy. It's a lot of pain in there right now, and that can't be healthy for you. I don't think my career is over, but that's something that Sal and the Nets will decide. I think at the worst, it will be a sabbatical. I think I just need some more rehab.</p>
        <p>''I never want to think my career is over because I love to play basketball, and it's the only thing I do really well.''</p>
        <p>Williams acknowledged that the Nets need an answer. ''I can't tell the Nets: 'Hey, I'll be ready in December, I'll be ready next year. Give me two years,' '' he said. ''They've got draft picks and other moves they have to make. They have to know if I'm back.''</p>
        <p>DiFazio was adamant that the Nets were not forcing Williams to decide soon. But there is no question that the team would benefit greatly from knowing Williams's status.</p>
        <p>If he cannot play this season, the Nets can receive a ''disabled player exception,'' allowing them to sign a free agent for $3.5 million to $3.9 million. If doctors determine that Williams will never play again, the remaining four years and $59.4 million of his six-year, $86 million contract will be removed from the Nets' salary cap figure on April 1, 2001.</p>
        <p>Whatever the case, Williams will not formally retire because he would then have to forfeit the rest of his contract. If he is declared disabled, under league regulations, he will be paid in full.</p>
        <p>Rod Thorn, the Nets' new president, said through a spokesman that he would not address the situation before meeting with Williams and DiFazio. That will not occur before next week.</p>
