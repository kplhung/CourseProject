        <p>Microsoft is more than a company that dominates a rapidly growing industry. To investors it has been a stock whose owners believed in it with almost religious conviction. Its declines were usually mild and always brief.</p>
        <p>But that faith has been shaken in the last couple of months, and now investors face the question of how well Microsoft can perform after its conduct has been ruled to be illegal and a breakup of the company ordered.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, as investors awaited Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision, Microsoft's stock rose 87.5 cents, to $70.25. In after-hours trading, as the actual court document was digested, the shares traded as high as $72.</p>
        <p>That gain, which may reflect some hope that the judge's strident tone would make a reversal more likely, still left the stock far below its peak of $119.9375 in December. Microsoft lost almost half its value as it sank to $61.4375 late last month. ''Investors think the ruling will be materially changed'' on appeal, said Richard G. Sherlund, a Goldman, Sachs analyst.</p>
        <p>If the breakup begins to appear likely, investor opinions of the future of the two Microsoft companies -- known informally as Ops Co., for operating-system company, and Apps Co., for the company that is to produce applications ranging from Microsoft Word to Internet Explorer -- will come to the fore.</p>
        <p>There is some worry that even though the operating company would retain an effective monopoly it would be so hamstrung by government oversight that its profit margins would inevitably erode. And there is concern that the applications company would be a less formidable competitor when deprived of its close relationship with the company that designs the operating system and thereby sets the rules for competition for other software companies.</p>
        <p>Over the longer term, the real issue may be whether investors lose their faith in Microsoft as a money machine whose rapid growth will end up justifying the purchase of its stock at any price. For years, Wall Street analysts routinely ignored cautions from Microsoft's management about the company's valuation and about potential profit problems, and were vindicated as the price continued to rise.</p>
        <p>For most of the 1990's, as Microsoft's profits and share price grew rapidly, one measure of investor confidence did not soar.</p>
        <p>The price-earnings ratio stayed in the 20's and 30's. Those were good-sized numbers, reflecting anticipations of substantial growth, but they were modest compared with what was to come. The P/E topped 40 in 1996, and by the end of last year it was up to 78. That figure may be overstated a bit, given that Microsoft's accounting is extremely conservative, but even after discounting for that, the price clearly assumed many years of rapid profit growth.</p>
        <p>Such growth is not easy for any company to produce, but it is even harder for one already as large as Microsoft. That the company could sell at such a high valuation in part reflected a general expansion of multiples in the bull market, but it also reflected investors' conviction that Microsoft had become a sure thing.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's aura of invincibility held even after the Justice Department set its sights on the company. Microsoft stock fell almost 4 percent on the day Justice filed suit against the company in 1998, but within two months it had not only recovered that loss but was up 30 percent more.</p>
        <p>As the trial progressed, there was plenty of bad news for Microsoft. But the stock price seldom fell for more than a few days, and at the peak in December was four times as high as it had been in late 1997, shortly after Judge Jackson ruled against Microsoft in an earlier antitrust case -- a ruling that was overturned on appeal. Even now, the stock is 58 percent above where it was when the latest suit was filed in 1998.</p>
        <p>The fall of Microsoft's stock price began in late March, just as many Internet stocks were beginning to crumble.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to calculate how much of the Microsoft plunge since then has represented specific fears about the ruling, and how much has been a reassessment of the extraordinary growth that the market had previously seemed to accept for virtually all technology stocks.</p>
        <p>At yesterday's stock price of $70.50 before the ruling was released, Microsoft was trading at 42 times the profits it reported over the last 12 months. That was a higher multiple than it enjoyed through the first half of the 1990's, hardly a time of investor pessimism regarding the company.</p>
        <p>The stock market, in other words, still expects great things from Microsoft, even if the expectations are not as high as they were late last year. There is room for severe disappointment if Microsoft loses on appeal -- or if it simply cannot keep growing at the extraordinary high rates of the past.</p>
