        <p>Two days after Indonesia's central bank governor was named as a suspect in a financial scandal, he and the government squared off today in a bitter showdown that could erode what little confidence investors have in this fragile country.</p>
        <p>The governor of Bank Indonesia, Syahril Sabirin, said he would not step down despite repeated requests from Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid. Mr. Sabirin denied any wrongdoing and said he was a victim of a political witch hunt.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I have stolen any money,'' Mr. Sabirin said in an interview on the CNBC Asia cable TV network. ''In fact, from my childhood, I don't think I have stolen any money.''</p>
        <p>Indonesia's chief law enforcement officer, however, said the governor should be suspended. Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said Mr. Sabirin could not serve as central bank governor while he was the target of a criminal investigation. He also rejected a decision by the speaker of Indonesia's parliament to allow Mr. Sabirin to keep his job until his fate was decided in a trial.</p>
        <p>''It's not a matter of interpretation or politics,'' Mr. Darusman said in an interview today. ''He has to be suspended temporarily. That's the law.''</p>
        <p>For Indonesians, who are steeped in scandals and political intrigue, the power struggle is simply another chapter in the stormy presidency of Mr. Wahid. But for foreign investors, who have watched from the sidelines as Indonesia has struggled to recover from the upheavals of 1998, it is a worrying sign that the country is once again spiraling out of control.</p>
        <p>Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, fell 0.52 percent in trading today, to 8,610 rupiah to the dollar. The rupiah has lost 19 percent of its value since the beginning of the year because of the political uncertainty.</p>
        <p>''The whole way Wahid handles disputes has been baffling,'' said Bill Kaye, the senior managing director of the Pacific Group, a hedge fund in Hong Kong that has so far avoided Indonesia. ''He's perceived as not only ineffectual, but also tainted by cronyism.''</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Wahid set off the rupiah's latest slide when he dismissed two respected cabinet ministers and replaced them with friends. In a twist typical of Indonesian politics, one of the ousted ministers, Laksamana Sukardi, is now a candidate to replace Mr. Sabirin at the central bank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid was also tainted when an official at the state logistics agency said he had transferred $4.2 million to the president's masseur. Much of the money has since been returned, and the scandal seems destined to be a footnote in the annals of Indonesian chicanery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabirin, however, was implicated in a more sensational scandal, the Bank Bali affair. The governor approved a $63 million payment from the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Authority to Bank Bali, ostensibly to cover loans owed to it by other banks. Bank Bali then funneled much of the money into a company linked to Indonesia's former ruling party, Golkar.</p>
        <p>The money was to be used to finance the presidential campaign of Mr. Wahid's predecessor, B. J. Habibie. Mr. Habibie withdrew from the election when it was clear he would suffer a crushing defeat. The public outrage over the Bank Bali affair was a major reason for his downfall.</p>
        <p>An outside investigation of the scandal concluded that Mr. Sabirin had attended a meeting in which the use of the money was discussed. He has denied attending the meeting, but other witnesses have contradicted him. The attorney general said Mr. Sabirin should not have approved the payment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabirin, who was appointed by Indonesia's former president, Suharto, was regarded as a competent and honest bureaucrat before the scandal broke. A courtly, soft-spoken man, he has nevertheless emerged as a stubborn foe of President Wahid and his attorney general.</p>
        <p>Mr. Darusman said today that Mr. Sabirin was a ''crucial element in the whole case.'' He said the governor could provide evidence that would allow it to pursue other senior officials in the Habibie administration who had helped orchestrate the plan.</p>
        <p>Despite the furor it is causing, some experts said the government's pursuit of Mr. Sabirin was a welcome sign. ''This suggests that the government is going to do something dramatic on the Bank Bali case soon,'' said James W. Castle, an longtime consultant here.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Darusman, who is also leading the government's investigation of the disgraced former president, Suharto, the Bank Bali case is a litmus test for Indonesia.</p>
        <p>''It represents the massive commercial fraud that took place in this country for years,'' he said. ''If we are going to be serious about tackling this problem, this case has got to be resolved. If we don't resolve it, people will regard the government with cynicism.''</p>
