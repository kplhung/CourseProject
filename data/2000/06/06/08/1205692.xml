        <p>Last night in the East Village, variations on several themes floated above the audience at a benefit concert for David Amram: that the young can gain much from listening to the old; that the community of artists is rich beyond paychecks; that music and generosity of spirit are closely linked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Amram, 69, the composer, French horn player and former accompanist to Jack Kerouac, suffered a major setback in October, when fire nearly destroyed his farmhouse in Putnam Valley.

        <p>Last night in the East Village, variations on several themes floated above the audience at a benefit concert for David Amram: that the young can gain much from listening to the old; that the community of artists is rich beyond paychecks; that music and generosity of spirit are closely linked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Amram, 69, the composer, French horn player and former accompanist to Jack Kerouac, suffered a major setback in October, when fire nearly destroyed his farmhouse in Putnam Valley. When his artist friends learned that the house had not been covered by insurance, they decided to help with a modern barn-raising, collecting money to help pay for renovations to the 60-year-old house, which needed to be gutted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Amram recalled running back into the house, past a firefighter who tried to stop him, to retrieve the last movement of the flute concerto he was writing for James Galway.</p>
        <p>''You'd walk through fire for James Galway?'' the firefighter asked.</p>
        <p>''Only once,'' Mr. Amram told him.</p>
        <p>He lost many pictures and papers, and all the belongings of two of his three children, but no one was hurt in the fire, and he remains buoyant.</p>
        <p>''If you want to hear someone sing the blues, I recommend getting some Bessie Smith records,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Artists on last night's program at St. Mark's Church in the East Village included Matoaka Little Eagle, a storyteller and singer (Mr. Amram took part in a memorial benefit for her father, Swift Eagle); Estelle Parsons, the actress, for whom he wrote a score for a production of ''Oedipus''; and Paul Krassner, editor of ''The Realist.'' Mr. Amram estimated that he and Mr. Krassner had been in 70 or 80 benefits together. This year is the first time he is the one to benefit.</p>
        <p>In an interview before the show, Mr. Amram let loose an ornate riff on the community of song, and how improvisation is necessary in life as well as in art. ''If you stay in the music for the true meaning of the music -- which is a celebration of life and a sharing of good feelings and a sensitivity towards others and realizing that like life itself, anything can happen at any moment -- your job as a musician, even a composer or conductor, is to turn a catastrophe into something beautiful, and to become, as Muhammad Ali said, a master of disaster.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Amram said that when he was composer in residence at the New York Philharmonic, Leonard Bernstein told him that part of his work was to contribute to the repertoire, to compose for musicians of the future.</p>
        <p>''That's something very hard for a lot of young people to be aware of now,'' Mr. Amram said. ''We don't live in that kind of a world, where those concepts are ever expressed in a public way.''</p>
        <p>Jason Eisenberg, who performed last night as Lord Buckley, the comedian and philosopher, calls himself an Amram acolyte. He had been helping with house repairs before the show.</p>
        <p>''David spent a good part of his long career doing the same kind of thing for other people,'' Mr. Eisenberg said. ''When you do good work, what goes around comes around.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Amram said that the people he associates with believe, as did Kerouac and the poets Sonia Sanchez, Langston Hughes and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, that their role is to be inclusive rather than exclusive. ''We came along at a time when, as young people, we were encouraged by a handful of older people, and we realize now that that's our job,'' he said. ''And it's our mission and our joy to be doing that.''</p>
        <p>David Kellet, a tenor, met Mr. Amram when he sang in the composer's opera ''Twelfth Night.'' ''I feel he's always given us so much, we want to give back to him,'' Mr. Kellett said last night. ''He generally, I believe, surrounds himself with people who look for the joy in music, who look for it to be something very special, not pedestrian.''</p>
        <p>On June 21, Mr. Amram will be appearing in Chicago, at a benefit for homeless children, and on June 30 he will play in Battery Park with Pete Seeger, for the International Celebration of Clear Waters.</p>
        <p>In a way, this can be expressed more concisely with the symbol that tells a musician to go to the top and start it all again. :</p>
