        <p>Hip-hop at its most inventive is a physics experiment. Artists mix charged particles -- breaking beats, spinning rhymes and fractured melodies -- to stimulate energetic reactions. The genre's mad scientists focus inward to go out, riding a flow of associations to create the sound of synapses crackling.</p>
        <p>Del tha Funkee Homosapien surfaced in the early 1990's as one of the most sizzling brains in the game. His return to S.O.B.'s Sunday night, after several years lying low, attracted a zealous crowd. Promoting a new, self-released album, ''Both Sides of the Brain'' (Hieroglyphics Imperium), the 26-year-old rapper from Oakland, Calif., coolly displayed his prized imagination. But Del was not alone in his laboratory. The other artists on the bill also caused a big bang.</p>

        <p>Hip-hop at its most inventive is a physics experiment. Artists mix charged particles -- breaking beats, spinning rhymes and fractured melodies -- to stimulate energetic reactions. The genre's mad scientists focus inward to go out, riding a flow of associations to create the sound of synapses crackling.</p>
        <p>Del tha Funkee Homosapien surfaced in the early 1990's as one of the most sizzling brains in the game. His return to S.O.B.'s Sunday night, after several years lying low, attracted a zealous crowd. Promoting a new, self-released album, ''Both Sides of the Brain'' (Hieroglyphics Imperium), the 26-year-old rapper from Oakland, Calif., coolly displayed his prized imagination. But Del was not alone in his laboratory. The other artists on the bill also caused a big bang.</p>
        <p>The rapper Buku did his best with the thankless warm-up slot, rapping amiably over tracks he played on a tiny portable DAT player. Next was M.C. Paul Barman. A slender, mop-topped fellow with a perpetual conciliatory grin, wearing a backpack and a T-shirt celebrating his hometown of Ridgewood, N.J., Mr. Barman didn't look like an insurgent. But as a Jewish rapper who speaks from the suburbs, he has caught a small backlash alongside considerable acclaim.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barman is a rap Woody Allen, self-deprecating and prudishly ribald. ''The Caucasoid had the whole block annoyed,'' he said in ''Old Paul,'' a fantasy glance back at his present fame from old age. Such brush-offs belied his nervousness. But as his D.J., AV, spun pleasant beats, Mr. Barman made it through his calculatedly goofy rhymes, his wit sparkling.</p>
        <p>Blackalicious came next, with a high-voltage set that confirmed its stellar reputation. Led by the rapper Gift of Gab, the Northern California crew also featured the rappers Lateef and Versatile; D.J. Chief Xcel on the turntables; and the singer Joyo Velarde.</p>
        <p>The group's relentless force recalled hard-core punk, with melody and grace augmenting pure adrenaline. Gift of Gab threw out words in hyperdrive, reaching a climax during the tongue-twisting ''Alphabet Aerobics.'' Lateef and a surprise guest, Lyrics Born, shared some joyful dancehall-flavored rhymes, and Versatile and Ms. Velarde harmonized seductively. Chief Xcel built a deep cushion of rhythms and riffs. The gusto shared by all sent the crowd into a frenzy.</p>
        <p>Del caught the Blackalicious tailwind, but demanded less ardor and more attention. Sharing rhymes with the rapper KU as the D.J. J-Biz shaped spare but complicated backing tracks, Del focused on matching form to content.</p>
        <p>Older hits like ''Mistadobolina,'' about a neighborhood oddball, found counterparts in the hilarious hygiene advisory ''If You Must'' and ''Proto Culture,'' an ode to Del's biggest nonmusical passion, video games. The rappers boasted -- all rappers must -- but Del sought to intrigue, not overwhelm.</p>
        <p>His gracefulness felt almost elusive after the Blackalicious onslaught. He made his fans think as well as bob their heads. This subtle approach didn't blow the roof off the club; instead, it got those inner connections bubbling, giving listeners energy to rekindle after the show.</p>
