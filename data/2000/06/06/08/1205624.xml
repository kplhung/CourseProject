        <p>The annual DanceAfrica festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music has carved out its rituals over 23 years of existence, ceremonies involving the dead and the children and elderly of the African-American dance community in New York. The festival also provides an occasion to discover new artists and get to know familiar ones better. ''DanceAfrica 2000: Cultural Connections,'' presented on Friday night, did not disappoint. The dancers and drummers of Genies Noirs from Benin, seen here in their New York debut, are a treasure.</p>
        <p>The four dances they presented, preceded by wittily exuberant commentary by the company's artistic adviser, Guillaume Coffi Adjaho, were as vivid and stylish as the beautiful costumes. One passage in ''Yaoitcha'' said it all, when a rich counterpoint was established in simultaneous movement for the four dancers' torsos, the women in long sweeping arcs and the men in urgent, sharply articulated undulations.</p>
        <p>The Rennie Harris Puremovement company is an increasingly major presence in New York dance. Here the Philadelphia-based troupe presented a piece in which movement was devoid of the social commentary that has at times diluted the power of Mr. Harris's choreography, which turns hip-hop into sophisticated concert dance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris clearly aims to excite. Where else might one see a man slide across the floor on his head? Amusingly, a series of whipping turns on the head looked not unlike an upended version of classical ballet's 32 fouette turns and other famous bursts of pyrotechnics. Mr. Harris and his 11 bare-chested male performers surged through precision formations staged with deceptive simplicity. The patterns and the dancers' physical control were stunning.</p>
        <p>The Djoule African Dancers and Musicians of Brooklyn offered the dance equivalent of exuberant church-service speaking in tongues, performed in wonderfully stylish costumes. Completing the program, the children of the BAM/Restoration DanceAfrica Ensemble, immaculately rehearsed by Pat Dye, performed in savvy African dance-based choreography by Eric Mensah, Karen Thornton and Chuck Davis, the festival's infectiously joyful founder and master of ceremonies.</p>
