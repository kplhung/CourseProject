        <p>Dorrell Mainer and Kevin Rainey were eager to celebrate their wedding this Saturday in Brooklyn. They expected 150 friends and relatives, including Mr. Rainey's elderly mother from South Carolina.</p>
        <p>But the police said that when a financial setback threatened the nuptials, the couple so worried about disappointing their relatives that they devised a money-making plan not found in any bridal planner: bank robbery.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, after a botched bank robbery in Coney Island, their wedding plans were in even greater disarray, the police said. The couple were arraigned in Brooklyn Criminal Court on one count each of first-degree robbery.</p>
        <p>They tried to rob the Chase Manhattan Bank branch at 722 Brighton Beach Avenue shortly after noon on Tuesday, the police said. Ms. Mainer, 38, walked up to a teller and passed a note, while Mr. Rainey, 41, was a lookout by the door, the police said.</p>
        <p>The note demanded money and said that a bomb linked to the bank's telephone system would detonate if the teller called the police, said a police supervisor familiar with its contents. It also referred to a sick child who needed care and said the couple ''had nothing to lose in robbing the bank,'' the supervisor said.</p>
        <p>But the teller stalled Ms. Mainer, the police said, forcing the couple to flee without any cash. They were arrested minutes later, after stopping at a doughnut shop to use the bathroom.</p>
        <p>After their arrests, Ms. Mainer and Mr. Rainey admitted that they did not have a sick child, according to investigators. Instead, they said, Ms. Mainer told a different tale of woe: a tax refund that was to go toward the wedding had been taken back by the government because the Internal Revenue Service had overpaid her.</p>
        <p>They tried to rob the bank, the supervisor said, because ''they didn't want to disappoint their family members.'' The police also said that Ms. Mainer was a suspect in two bank robberies in Queens. But Ms. Mainer's lawyer, Paula Notari, said she was a ''stellar member of the community'' with no criminal record, who supported her three children and had a bachelor's degree from John Jay College.</p>
        <p>The police said that in her statement to them, Ms. Mainer apologized for the robbery attempt. Mr. Rainey's lawyer at the arraignment, Julie Clark, claimed that he knew nothing of the robbery and thought his fiancee had stopped by the bank to make a wire transfer.</p>
        <p>It was unclear yesterday whether the wedding, which had been set for Saturday at the First A.M.E. Zion Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant, would go forward. Neither Mr. Rainey nor Ms. Mainer immediately posted bail. And the church clerk, Hazel Harvey, said she was astounded to hear about the arrests.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 10, 2000, Saturday  An article on Thursday about Dorrell Mainer and Kevin Rainey, a couple who said they robbed a bank to pay for their wedding, misstated Ms. Mainer's educational background. Although her lawyer, Paula Notari, said in court that Ms. Mainer had a bachelor's degree from John Jay College, a college official says she was enrolled for only one semester, in 1981, and earned no grade points.</p>
