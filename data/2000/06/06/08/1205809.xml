        <p>ALTHOUGH jittery, frenetic images were the height of film artistry in the early 90's, it isn't a good technique for immortalizing your 10-year-old's first soccer goal on videotape. And therein lies a problem. As camcorders have become smaller and lighter, with greater zoom capabilities, they have magnified the operator's tiniest tremors. Even breathing can result in a jerky image.</p>
        <p>But the camcorder industry has responded with technology that can reduce the jiggle. Digital equipment can read a recorded image and make adjustments to compensate for movement, while mechanical optical systems can keep an image centered and in focus by using motion sensors that move the lens to counter unwanted motion.</p>
        <p>The problem isn't unique to the camcorder industry. Hollywood filmmakers have long struggled to move cameras without introducing unwanted quivers into the picture. Movie makers often put a camera on a heavy dolly that rolls on smooth railroad-like tracks. ''This has always been a difficulty,'' said Robert Dickson, a historian with the American Film Institute. ''The camera has to be pushed carefully.''</p>
        <p>Cinematographers began to experience the problems that would face home video enthusiasts when lighter-weight cameras, about 35 pounds, began to replace their 80-to-110-pound predecessors in the early 1970's. John Hora, a cinematographer, said he confronted the problem on ''The Twilight Zone,'' a movie made in 1983.</p>
        <p>''You could see a little motion if you look right at the edge of the frame,'' Mr. Hora said. In later movies, he went back to heavier equipment. ''If you run over a little piece of tape on the track with a heavy piece of equipment, you won't feel it,'' he said. ''It's like being in a Cadillac and hitting a bump -- you float right over it. A lighter unit is like a sports car -- you'd feel the bump.'' And see it as well.</p>
        <p>The popularity of the handheld shot created more trouble for camera operators, who had to develop a gliding Groucho-style walk to keep from shaking the camera. ''You have to walk with your knees bent,'' Mr. Hora said. ''There's a real skill to it.''</p>
        <p>That changed with the Steadicam, a system that suspends a camera on spring-loaded arms that are attached to a vest worn by a camera operator. But even the amateur version of the Steadicam costs more than $1,300.</p>
        <p>In 1992, the home camcorder industry recognized the shaky-picture problem: cameras had become so light that hand tremors would move them And longer lenses made the problem worse. Just as a small error at the rifle leads to bigger and bigger errors as targets are farther and farther away, clearing your throat will appear as an earthquake when you are recording on videotape at a magnification of 22X.</p>
        <p>A digital solution, developed about 1996, lets the lens illuminate just part of the camcorder's imaging chip. When the camera moves, the whole frame changes position on the chip, but it still registers in its entirety. The camera's computer picks a fixed point in the picture, like the outside edge of the frame, then stabilizes that edge as a fixed point on the recording.</p>
        <p>But the system is fallible. ''You are not sensing motion on the part of the camera,'' said Mark Weir, product planning manager for digital imaging at Sony Electronics. ''You are seeing how the image is changing and assuming its motion.'' If the camera is perfectly still and a hand is waved past it quickly, it might pan to the side because it assumes that the camera has moved.</p>
        <p>The most accurate variation uses a complex moving prism to keep the image centered. A mechanism typical of camcorders is Canon's variable-angle prism, actually a pair of prisms that move in relation to each other to change the spot where the image is projected onto the chip. The movement of the prisms is controlled by actuators that get signals from a microcomputer that monitors motion, direction and intensity.</p>
        <p>The prism movement adjusts for any shaking of the camcorder, smoothing out even distant shots. It tends to produce a more accurate, clearer picture than digital correction, but at a price. Digital motion correction adds about $100 to the price of a camcorder, Mr. Weir said, but the optical correction adds close to $300.</p>
