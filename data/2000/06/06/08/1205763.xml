        <p>Bolstering the encouraging results of recent state tests, the Board of Education reported yesterday that students in New York City performed significantly better this year on a citywide reading test. Still, only 40.8 percent met the rigorous new curriculum standards on which they were being tested, compared with 35.7 percent last year.</p>
        <p>The increase of 5.1 percentage points for third, fifth, sixth and seventh graders, who took their test in April, came less than a week after state education officials reported that fourth graders across the state had shown a remarkable improvement of 11 percentage points in the second year of a new fourth-grade reading test. The scores of New York City's fourth graders increased by nine percentage points.</p>

        <p>Bolstering the encouraging results of recent state tests, the Board of Education reported yesterday that students in New York City performed significantly better this year on a citywide reading test. Still, only 40.8 percent met the rigorous new curriculum standards on which they were being tested, compared with 35.7 percent last year.</p>
        <p>The increase of 5.1 percentage points for third, fifth, sixth and seventh graders, who took their test in April, came less than a week after state education officials reported that fourth graders across the state had shown a remarkable improvement of 11 percentage points in the second year of a new fourth-grade reading test. The scores of New York City's fourth graders increased by nine percentage points.</p>
        <p>Board of Education officials said yesterday that the combined improvements on the state and city scores showed that their efforts to improve literacy rates among elementary school students over the last five years were finally taking hold throughout the long-troubled school system.</p>
        <p>Indeed, all of the city's 32 community school districts improved their scores. Even the chancellor's district -- a new district comprising the worst schools in the city -- had 11.8 percent fewer students score at the lowest of the four performance levels used in grading the tests.</p>
        <p>The citywide test scores, along with the state scores released last week, will help determine which of the city's 1.1 million schoolchildren will be required to attend summer school this year. Classroom performance and attendance rates are the other two factors. Schools will decide by tomorrow which students they will require to attend the summer program, which will be the largest in the city's history.</p>
        <p>Comments by education experts interviewed yesterday were notable for their absence of skepticism, with most saying that this second round of tests affirms the efforts by Richard P. Mills, the state's education commissioner, and Rudy Crew, New York City's former chancellor, to impose more uniform standards for what students should learn in each grade and to demand that those standards be heeded.</p>
        <p>''I am surprised,'' said Norman Fruchter, director of the Institute for Education and Social Policy at New York University. ''With the caution that this is only the second year of a new test, these are certainly encouraging trends.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fruchter and several others pointed out that scores often rise sharply in the second year that a new test is given, and that for several years after that, scores creep up only a little, if at all.</p>
        <p>There were some anomalies in yesterday's results, however, that board officials acknowledged were mystifying. Fifth graders actually did worse this year, with their average score falling by 4.1 points. The average score of third graders barely improved, by six-tenths of a point.</p>
        <p>The most impressive gains were among sixth graders, whose average score improved by 12.4 points, and seventh graders, whose average score rose by 11.8 points. The content of each grade's test was different.</p>
        <p>As in the state's fourth-grade reading test, the scores of white and Asian students rose more sharply than those of black and Hispanic students, who make up 73 percent of the city's 1.1 million schoolchildren. Only 3.7 percent of black and 3.1 percent of Hispanic students achieved the highest level of proficiency this year, up from 3.3 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively.</p>
        <p>District 26 in Queens and District 2 in Manhattan ranked first and second among city districts, just as they did on the statewide reading test. The chancellor's district had the lowest scores, followed by District 5 in Harlem and District 9 in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Harold O. Levy acknowledged that the results were ''a mixed bag,'' especially considering that more than half of the 300,000 students who took the citywide reading tests in April failed to show proficiency in state and city standards. But he said that he was cautiously sanguine.</p>
        <p>''If you have gradual, consistent and measured change like we seem to be seeing, then I think it's cause to be very content that we are moving in the right direction,'' Mr. Levy said as he presented the test results at a Board of Education meeting yesterday. ''The challenge for us will be: is it confirmed by subsequent data? We are clearly still not good enough.'''</p>
        <p>This year, for the first time, New York City adopted the state's method of scoring and reporting standardized test scores, so that scores on city tests could be easily compared with those on state tests. The scoring is now based on whether students achieve proficiency in the skills demanded by the new state and city learning standards, instead of on how city students compare with a fluctuating national average.</p>
        <p>City testing officials said yesterday that the old scoring system was less rigorous, but New York City scores were hardly stellar under that system, either. Last year, 48.5 percent of the city's third, fifth, sixth and seventh graders read at or above the national average for their grade level, an increase of 4.9 percentage points over 1998.</p>
        <p>Under the new system, education officials said, it is easier to follow the progress of individual students as they progress through each grade. For example, the officials said they were able to compare how students who were held back this year performed on the test compared with last year. They found that most of those students did significantly better after repeating a grade.</p>
        <p>''This is a powerful tool in the hands of administrators who worry about what are the right programs we've got to get in place and where do we need the most results,'' Mr. Levy said.</p>
        <p>Board of Education officials said yesterday that it would take time to figure out exactly what caused overall scores to improve so much this year -- and more important, why the scores of fifth graders fell. But they pointed to recent initiatives like class size reduction, expansion of prekindergarten programs and a new system of testing literacy skills in the earliest grades that is supposed to help teachers individualize instruction.</p>
        <p>They also pointed to Project Read, an after-school reading program for grades one through four that was a centerpiece of Dr. Crew's four-year tenure.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Levy said the worst schools would not see significant improvement until they sharply increased the numbers of certified and experienced teachers on their staffs. Those schools tend to have the most poorly qualified teachers in the system, in part because of union rules that allow senior teachers to choose their assignments.</p>
        <p>The citywide reading test is an hourlong test with about 50 multiple-choice questions. Each grade level gets a different test, although the format is the same. It mostly tests reading comprehension, asking children to analyze passages and in some cases to use inferential reasoning. In a sample question, students read a passage about Abraham Lincoln that ended with an anecdote about a humorous command he gave his troops during the Black Hawk War. Students had to guess how the troops responded to the command.</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, president of the city teachers' union, said yesterday that while she was happy with the improved scores, she was starting to worry that students were spending too much classroom time drilling for standardized tests.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weingarten said she did not mind students' spending a lot of time preparing for the fourth-grade reading test, which includes not only multiple-choice questions, but also lengthy writing exercises. But she wondered aloud whether students should spend months preparing for the citywide multiple-choice test, in which they do not have to demonstrate writing skills.</p>
        <p>''The reality of life is that there are going to be tests aligned with the high standards,'' she said. ''But this overreliance on test scores to the exclusion of all else is not what education is about. I have heard from teachers throughout the system that there is a whole lot of test prep, a lot of drilling going on throughout the year.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Levy and Judith Rizzo, the deputy chancellor for instruction, said that for now, multiple-choice tests were the best approach for such a huge, diverse school system.</p>
        <p>''It's a crude instrument, but it works,'' Mr. Levy said. ''Does it work well for each individual, and are there better ways to do it? Of course there are. But for now, this is what we've got.''</p>
        <p>School-by-school results will appear on Sunday in The City section.</p>
