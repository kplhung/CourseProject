        <p>Larry Bird did not want to create a fuss. He knew he was coming back to L.A. to face the Lakers in the playoffs for the first time since 1987, and he knew at some point this evening he and his rival in time, Magic Johnson, would embrace and share a nostalgic moment of trash talk.</p>
        <p>But there is no use being too emotional. It is not like Bird, the coach of the Indiana Pacers, and Johnson, the Lakers' vice president and part-owner, will be genuinely dueling in the National Basketball Association finals.</p>
        <p>''How is it a rivalry,'' Bird began, ''when I'm on the hot seat and he's watching from the cheap seats? Magic doesn't have any pressure on him.''</p>
        <p>Johnson's reply: ''Is that what Larry said? Oh, no, here we go again.''</p>
        <p>Nothing changes.</p>
        <p>When Reggie Miller and Shaquille O'Neal took center court tonight, millions of eyes followed their every move. Bird and Johnson, two stars of the 1980's, were there, too, going at each other peripherally as they continued to ease their way into another competitive arena.</p>
        <p>Coach Bird and Magic Inc. -- trying to deal with life after the legs give out.</p>
        <p>''When you come out of the finals,'' Commissioner David Stern said, ''sure there's a nostalgia with both Magic and Larry there. I'm especially delighted to see Magic here. When I see a vibrant-looking Magic Johnson, I feel better. Because in 1991, we didn't anticipate that would be the case.''</p>
        <p>Johnson first retired in November 1991 after he learned he had contracted the virus that causes AIDS. Before his announcement, he phoned several friends, including Bird, who began crying.</p>
        <p>But with the most prominent physicians, the newest and most effective drugs to treat H.I.V. and a constant health regimen, he has managed to stave off the disease. Enough to actually put together his own overseas traveling team and play again, an annual event in addition to his other chores as a business executive.</p>
        <p>After staying semiretired in Florida and serving as a figurehead consultant for the Celtics, Bird took over the Pacers three years ago with the intention of winning a championship.</p>
        <p>More than two decades after they propelled the N.B.A. to once-unimaginable popularity, they are helping oversee a difficult transition period.</p>
        <p>''I'm waiting on the game to start flowing again,'' Johnson said. ''We don't flow. Whether it was the Celtics or us, or Portland and us, the game flowed. You'd say, 'You got to get back on defense.' ''</p>
        <p>Bird agreed. ''I don't think the N.B.A. is totally back,'' he said. ''We played Milwaukee in a Game 4 there and they didn't sell out. It just seems like a lot of people aren't talking about the N.B.A. as much as they used to.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to seem get more teams on TV than just the Lakers and New York. I think it's coming back. But the only way it comes back is if you have great competition.''</p>
        <p>With O'Neal and Kobe Bryant and the Lakers coming back from 15 down in the fourth quarter against Portland to win Game 7 of the Western Conference finals on Sunday, the hope for Stern and his network partners is that these Lakers can help generate the same type of intrigue and story lines that led to record-high ratings in the late 1980's and 1990's -- when the Celtics and Lakers battled and Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls took on everyone.</p>
        <p>Johnson said Bird's success in Indiana had inspired him to perhaps get back in coaching after an ill-fated attempt with the Lakers after his playing days.</p>
        <p>''Because of Larry, I want to coach,'' he said. ''Almost.</p>
        <p>Neither Bird nor Johnson have the control they once had, when their games, their styles and their rivalry came to embody the basketball passion of their respective cities.</p>
        <p>But don't tell Johnson.</p>
        <p>''One more time,'' he said. ''I knew it would be at checkers, softball or something. I didn't know it would be basketball. Head to head. Us against each other. We thought something would happen that we'd be up against each other again. It just seemed like that's how things are supposed to be.''</p>
