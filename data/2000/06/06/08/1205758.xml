        <p>With Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana barred by law from seeking a third consecutive term, his lieutenant governor, Judy Martz, and State Auditor Mark O'Keefe had little trouble winning their gubernatorial primaries on Tuesday to face each other in the November general election.</p>
        <p>Democrats regard Montana as one of their best hopes for picking up a governorship, as well as seats in Congress.</p>
        <p>In the Democratic primary, Mr. O'Keefe won 48 percent of the vote to defeat two other state officials, Attorney General Joseph P. Mazurek, with 36 percent, and Secretary of State Mike Cooney, with 16 percent.</p>
        <p>Ms. Martz, a Republican who has served with Mr. Racicot since 1996, had 57 percent of the vote to 43 percent for Rob Natelson, a law professor who fared better this time than four years ago, when he won only 24 percent in a challenge to Mr. Racicot.</p>
        <p>Montana was also one of several states that held Congressional primaries on Tuesday. In winning the state's Democratic Senate primary, Brian Schweitzer, a farmer who made the high cost of prescription drugs a campaign focus, easily defeated John Driscoll, a former state public service commissioner. He now faces Senator Conrad Burns, the two-term Republican incumbent, who had no primary opponent.</p>
        <p>Ms. Martz and Mr. O'Keefe both said they would make economic development a priority. Montana ranks lowest among the states in average wages, 47th in per capita income and, Mr. O'Keefe said, first in the percentage of families in which the chief wage earner holds at least two jobs.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Keefe said those rankings reflected how poorly the Racicot administration had performed, but Ms. Martz said the situation had been far worse when Mr. Racicot took office in 1993, when the state was $200 million in debt.</p>
        <p>In New Mexico, Democrats held primaries in all three of the state's Congressional districts. Seeking the right to oppose Representative Joe Skeen, a 10-term Republican from the Second Congressional District, State Treasurer Michael A. Montoya narrowly defeated Mike Runnels, a district attorney, despite a recent investigation by the New Mexico state police into accusations that Mr. Montoya's brother, Orlando Montoya, diverted money from his construction business into the campaign.</p>
        <p>Michael Montoya won 52 percent of the vote to 48 percent for Mr. Runnels, a showing that Mr. Montoya said might have been helped by a sympathetic backlash against the police investigation, which, so far, has produced no charges.</p>
        <p>In the First Congressional District, John J. Kelly, a former United States attorney, won 43 percent of the vote in a three-way race to face Representative Heather A. Wilson, a first-term Republican whom Democrats view as one of the most vulnerable members of the House majority. Mr. Kelly defeated Sam Bregman, a former Albuquerque City Council member, who won 33 percent of the vote, and John V. Wertheim, the party's nominee four years ago, who had 24 percent.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Skeen and Ms. Wilson ran unopposed, but not so New Mexico's other incumbent representative, Tom Udall, a freshman Democrat, who soundly defeated Francesca Lobato, a tax lawyer from Santa Fe, with 83 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>Lisa L. Lutz, a state representative, ran unopposed to win the Republican nomination.</p>
        <p>In the Republican Senate primary, former Representative Bill Redmond breezed to victory in a three-way race, with 60 percent of the vote, to oppose Senator Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat seeking his fourth term. State Representative Stevan E. Pearce had 22 percent and State Senator William F. Davis had 18 percent.</p>
        <p>In South Dakota, Curt Hohn, general manager of the Water Development Association, beat two other Democrats for the right to oppose Representative John Thune, a two-term Republican who was expected to win in November no matter who prevailed among the Democrats. With the turnout extremely light, Mr. Hohn won 56 percent of the vote, to 36 percent for Steve Sandven and 7 percent for Raymond Osloond .</p>
        <p>In Iowa, each party had two primaries. In the First Congressional District, Democrats chose Bob Simpson over Gregory Guy by almost 2 to 1, although Mr. Simpson is given only a slim chance against Representative Jim Leach, the 12-term Republican incumbent. In the Third Congressional District, Jay Marcus narrowly defeated Phil Ferren to oppose Iowa's only Democratic House member, Leonard L. Boswell, who is seeking a third term.</p>
        <p>Both parties held primaries in the Fifth Congressional District. Mike Palecek defeated Conrad Lawlor for the Democratic nomination, and Representative Tom Latham, a Republican seeking a fourth term, easily turned back Thomas Hall.</p>
        <p>In the only Alabama Congressional contest, Representative Earl F. Hilliard, a four-term Democrat from a solidly Democratic district, the Seventh, won 58 percent of the vote to defeat two challengers, Arthur Davis and Wayne Sowell. Ed Martin won the right to oppose him for the Republicans.</p>
