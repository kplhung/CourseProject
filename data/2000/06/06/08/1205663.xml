        <p>Paced by technology issues, stock prices resumed their climb yesterday as the belief spread that the Federal Reserve could soon stop raising interest rates to keep inflation in check.</p>
        <p>After a lackluster start, the Nasdaq composite index pushed solidly higher and finished just shy of its best level, with an advance of 82.89 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,839.26.</p>
        <p>Optimistic comments about I.B.M. by a Goldman, Sachs analyst helped send the company's shares up 8 5/8, to 121, and rippled throughout the market, accounting for about 60 percent of the Dow Jones industrial average's rise of 77.29 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,812.86.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's action left the Nasdaq with a smaller decline so far this year than the Dow -- 5.65 percent compared with 5.95 percent -- despite suffering a 34 percent skid between March 10 and April 14.</p>
        <p>And the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index nosed back into positive territory for the year. It climbed 13.52 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,471.36 yesterday. The index is now ahead for the year by 0.14 percent.</p>
        <p>''We're basically in a bullish trend because there's much less fear that they'll increase rates past June,'' said Mayer Offman, chief trading strategist at the Carlin Equities Group, referring to Federal Reserve policy makers whose next scheduled meeting is June 27 and 28. He also called it a very good sign that recent sinking spells had attracted bargain hunters.</p>
        <p>As trading began, Alfred E. Goldman, chief strategist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis, made a sweepingly upbeat declaration. ''We are ringing the bell to announce that the three-month 'bearable' correction is over and a summer rally has begun,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldman cited slackening economic growth and the market's reaction to this news last week when the Nasdaq surged a record 19 percent. He also predicted the Fed would forgo a June rate increase.</p>
        <p>With 38.2 million shares changing hands, Microsoft was the most heavily traded stock yesterday as the market awaited the decision by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who ordered the company to be broken in two. The shares moved as low as 67 1/8, but were up  7/8, to 70 1/2 at 4 p.m., and they climbed to 71 3/4 in after-hours trading.</p>
        <p>But yesterday's gains were highly concentrated in technology, with declining shares slightly outnumbering advancing ones, 244 to 238, in the S.&amp; P. and by 16 to 14 in the blue-chip Dow industrials.</p>
        <p>Among the biggest Nasdaq technology winners yesterday were Qualcomm, up 51 3/16, to 74 11/16; Veritas Software up 9 5/8, to 134 1/2; Yahoo up 9 7/16, to 144 1/2; i2 Technologies up 11 1/4, to 138 1/4; and MicroStrategy up 9 5/8, to 37 5/8. Immunex, which won approval for expanded use of an arthritis drug, jumped 41 3/64, to 36 5/16. Applied Micro Circuits skidded 91 5/16, to 96 7/8, after warning of lower sales to its biggest customer.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Fall</p>
        <p>(By Reuters) -- Treasury bond prices ended mostly lower yesterday after the market worked through some $8 billion in corporate debt deals.</p>
        <p>The 10-year note slipped 5/32, to 102 19/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.14 percent from 6.12 percent. The 30-year bond fell 1/32, to 104 26/32, and its yield edged up to 5.91 percent from 5.90 percent.</p>
        <p>Analysts said trading related to large sales of corporate debt was responsible for price movements during the session.</p>
        <p>Treasury prices weakened early as players sold Treasuries to hedge against the risk of the market's falling when a large corporate debt deal was being brought to market.</p>
        <p>Up to $19 billion worth of corporate paper is coming to market this week, making it easily the busiest week of company debt sales so far this year.</p>
        <p>The Ford Motor Credit Company, the financing arm of Ford Motor, sold $2 billion of three-year global notes and $2.5 billion of 10-year global notes.</p>
        <p>And International Paper, the world's largest paper and forest products company, sold $800 million in two-year floating-rate notes, $1.2 billion in three-year fixed-rate notes and $1 billion in five-year fixed-rate notes, market sources said.</p>
