        <p>SERBIA: SENTENCE VOIDED  The Supreme Court has overturned the guilty verdict and prison sentence of Kosovo's most prominent human rights activist, Dr. Flora Brovina, her lawyer said. The court sent the case back to a lower court for review, which is likely to mean a new trial or, possibly, the dropping of charges. The court also urged that Dr. Brovina be released on bail, her lawyer said. Dr. Brovina, an ethnic Albanian, was convicted of terrorism on Dec. 9 and sentenced to 12 years in prison, prompting an international outcry.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: HOPE FOR PAPAL VISIT  Talks on a reconciliation between the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox Churches may resume this fall, officials said, raising hopes Pope John Paul II might still make the first papal visit to Russia in almost a millennium. The two churches have been at odds since Christianity split in 1054, and the gap widened in 1998 after NATO's attack on Yugoslavia, an ally of Russia. Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin raised the prospect of a papal visit to Russia in a visit to Italy this week.</p>

        <p>GREECE: CHURCH CALLS PROTEST  A week after branding the prime minister a dictator, the Greek Orthodox Church has called on its followers to take to the streets to protest the government's decision to abolish religious affiliation from state identity cards. Archbishop Christodolous and a council of 79 prelates agreed to the move after Prime Minister Costas Simitis turned down their request for a meeting. The church-led protests will start in Salonika next Wednesday and end in Athens a week later.</p>

        <p>SLOVENIA: NEW GOVERNMENT  After two months without a government, Slovenia got a center-right cabinet headed by Andrej Bajuk, a conservative prime minister. The tiny nation, which broke away from the former Yugoslavia in 1991, is the wealthiest, per capita, in eastern Europe and among the first nations in line for membership in the European Union. All sides were worried that the government crisis would hurt Slovenia's reputation abroad.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: STASI GRAVE DEFACED  The grave of Erich Mielke, the former chief of Stasi, East Germany's secret police, was vandalized just hours after his burial on Tuesday. Flowers and wreaths were ripped up at the unmarked headstone in the Berlin Friedrichsfelde cemetery. Mr. Mielke's grave was placed outside the memorial section where Communist heroes like Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, co-founders of the German Communist Party, were buried.</p>

        <p>BRAZIL: LANDMARK RULING  In a landmark case, a prominent Amazon landowner has been sentenced to 19 years in prison for ordering the 1991 assassination of a leader of the local farmworkers' union. ''This is a historic moment,'' said Luiz Eduardo Greenhalgh, a lawyer for the union. ''It is the first time in Brazil that the mastermind of a crime against a rural worker has been found guilty.'' After the killing Jeronimo Alves de Amorim fled to Mexico, where he was seized last year.</p>

        <p>COLOMBIA: PEACE MOVES  In an effort to advance peace talks with the two main left-wing guerrilla groups, President Andres Pastrana has ordered a six-month extension of a demilitarization pact with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, permitting the group to keep control of a Switzerland-size area. He also granted formal negotiating status to the Army of National Liberation, saying it ''has demonstrated a will to negotiate the armed conflict.''</p>

        <p>CHINA: INTERNET ARREST  The police have arrested the operator of an Internet site whose postings included material about dissident activities, the 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square and other delicate topics, according to rights groups. Huang Qi is being charged with subversion, which can carry a long prison sentence. The Web site's address, www.6-4tianwang, is a clear reference to June 4, 1989, when the Chinese Army dispersed the Tiananmen protesters, killing hundreds.</p>

        <p>NORTH KOREA, U.S.: M.I.A. TALKS  Officials from both countries began new efforts to resume the search for some 8,000 Americans listed as missing in action in the Korean War. ''Our desired outcome is to get a schedule for our team to go back into North Korea,'' said Larry Greer, a spokesman for the Defense Department's Prisoner of War and Missing in Action office. Talks in Malaysia are expected to end tomorrow.</p>

        <p>IRAN: REFORMIST GAINS  The Council of Guardians, the body that oversees elections, validated nine more seats from May's second round of parliamentary voting, giving all of them to reformists. This raised to 211 the number of reformists known to have won seats in the 290-seat body.</p>

        <p>BURUNDI: PEACE CONCESSION  In a concession toward peace, President Pierre Buyoya, left, agreed to close down dozens of camps where a third of a million Hutu farmers have been forced to live for the last nine months. Mr. Buyoya made the agreement after meetings in Johannesburg with Nelson Mandela, who is mediating talks to end the country's civil war. Mr. Buyoya's Tutsi-led government has said the camps are necessary to calm violence around the capital.</p>

        <p>CONGO: FIGHTING KILLS 50  At least 50 civilians have been killed since fighting broke out again between Rwandan and Ugandan soldiers in Kisangani, the United Nations and relief groups reported. Soldiers from the two nations, once allies, have clashed since last summer in Kisangani, where they have troops stationed to aid rebels fighting to overthrow Congo's government. Both have agreed to leave to make way for a United Nations force, but neither has done so.</p>
