        <p>Israeli Parliament Moves To Call Early Elections  Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government was thrown into tumult when a substantial majority of Parliament approved a bill to disperse and head toward new elections. Three of the six parties in Mr. Barak's broad coalition voted against him. Although the bill requires three more hearings to become law, it may break up the governing coalition and create a chaotic interlude as Mr. Barak seeks to prepare for final peace talks with the Palestinians.</p>
