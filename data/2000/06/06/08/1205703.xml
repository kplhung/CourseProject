      <block class="full_text">
        <p>If a moment can have a message, Robert D. Franks was sending one by beginning his race as the Republican nominee for the United States Senate at the Lido Diner here.</p>
        <p>''The Lido Diner, that's as middle-class New Jersey as you can get,'' Raymond Bateman, an experienced Republican leader in the state, said with a laugh.  ''That's Bob Franks.''</p>
        <p>For most of the spring, Mr. Franks, who is in his fourth term in Congress, and the other three Republican candidates were eclipsed by the civil war within the Democratic Party between Jon S. Corzine and Jim Florio.</p>
        <p>Now that Mr. Franks is the presumed Republican nominee, he will step out into the limelight alone to face Mr. Corzine in the general election. The face he is most likely to present is of a typical New Jerseyan, a successful suburban lawyer with a wife and a little daughter, stepping out of the Lido Diner after breakfast.</p>
        <p>With 99 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Franks had 95,801 votes, 35.4 percent, and State Senator William L. Gormley had 92,454, 34.2 percent. But with absentee ballots uncounted, Mr. Gormley refused to concede this morning, saying in a statement that the vote had to be certified first.</p>
        <p>The image Mr. Franks presented at the Lido is one he evidently expects New Jerseyans to be comfortable with, and one he hopes to contrast with Mr. Corzine's self-financed $35 million scorched-earth campaign against Mr. Florio. Mr. Franks has said that Mr. Corzine is out of touch with average New Jerseyans, and in his victory speech early this morning he challenged Mr. Corzine to meet him at the Lido for the first debate.</p>
        <p>As it happened, Mr. Corzine was up just as early, thanking voters at Journal Square in Jersey City. So Mr. Franks stood alone in front of the diner and took a poke at his rival.</p>
        <p>''Jon is going to have to answer the voters' questions,'' Mr. Franks said in the early light of a sparkling day. ''He can no longer hide behind the multimillion-dollar ad campaigns and the focus groups. He is going to have to come out here to these diners and answer the tough questions.''</p>
        <p>One of the sharpest contrasts between Mr. Franks and Mr. Corzine is political experience. Mr. Corzine has never held public office, and Mr. Franks, 48, has spent much of his life in politics, including 14 years in the State Assembly and 8 as a congressman. He has never lost an election, although he has come close.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks borrowed a campaign slogan from Mr. Florio last night when he introduced a theme he is sure to repeat in the next five months: that he is a man ''with experience you can't buy.''</p>
        <p>He began in Republican politics in 1964, when he was a 13-year-old with a tab collar and a skinny tie going door to door in suburban Chicago, where he lived, for Charles H. Percy's unsuccessful campaign for governor.</p>
        <p>After he got his law degree from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Mr. Franks joined the staff of Tom Kean's successful campaign for governor in 1981. The next year he directed James A. Courter's Senate campaign, and then the 1984 House race of Dean A. Gallo. He went on to  two separate stints as chairman of the State Republican Committee.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Mr. Corzine's sudden dash from nowhere for the Senate, Mr. Franks spent years cultivating political friendships. Instead of searching for a promising Congressional seat, he patiently waited for his friend, Matthew Rinaldo, to retire from the Seventh District in 1992  before running. He has held the seat ever since.</p>
        <p>''I've watched all of the politicians in both parties, and the one who has developed the best is Bob Franks,'' said Mr. Bateman, who can name every presidential candidate who carried New Jersey back to Dewey  in 1948. ''Before, he was not that good on his feet; now he's terrific. He's good with people and he's good on the issues and he's going to be tough for Corzine to handle.''</p>
        <p>Philosophically, Mr. Franks is as middle of the road as diner coffee. In 1998, the National Taxpayers Union, an antitax group, rated him at 50 percent. The Concord Coalition, which aims to eliminate the federal deficit, rated him at 33 percent.</p>
        <p>It was the absence of ideological rigor in Mr. Franks that prompted  Governor Kean to make Mr. Franks his Assembly floor leader. Even Mr. Bateman, an early admirer, once said he thought Mr. Franks was more comfortable managing party business than legislating, with its tough up-or-down choices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks earned Mr. Gormley's scorn in 1990, when he twice abstained on a bill that Governor Florio had backed that would ban certain kinds of semiautomatic firearms,  and which Mr. Gormley supported.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks's preference for compromise was also evident in 1998, when he long resisted committing himself on the Republican House leadership drive to impeach President Clinton. While other members of the state delegation declared for impeachment, Mr. Franks remained neutral, hoping that a vote would be averted, until finally voting to impeach on three of the four counts.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because of this reputation, Mr. Franks has been called bland. On the cover of the May issue of the New Jersey Reporter, a public affairs magazine, Mr. Gormley was drawn holding cards and poker chips, symbols of his support for Atlantic City's gambling industry.  Mr. Franks was drawn holding a pint of vanilla ice cream.</p>
