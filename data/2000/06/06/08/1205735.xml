        <p>From the perspective of the Microsoft Corporation, the nation's largest software company, the fat lady hasn't sung.</p>
        <p>Arguing that his legal battle with the federal government is far from over, William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman and chief software architect, said today that he was looking forward to the next round of the antitrust trial, which will soon move to a higher court.</p>
        <p>''I'm reminded of the old saying that, 'Today is the first day of the rest of your life,' '' Mr. Gates said during a news conference here on the sprawling campus of his company. ''I believe very strongly that today is the first day of the rest of this case.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates appeared calm today, briefly stumbling over his words at the outset of his prepared remarks but then warming to his theme that during the appeals, Microsoft would continue to do what he believed the company does best: design software.</p>
        <p>He reiterated his belief that Microsoft had done nothing wrong. And when asked if he felt he might have done anything differently, he responded that his only regret was not articulating Microsoft's story earlier and more clearly to the American public.</p>
        <p>''Microsoft and the whole story of the PC was missed here,'' he said. ''I should have taken the opportunity to go and talk about this industry and what it has meant in terms of empowering people.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Gates did not go so far as to assert that what was good for Microsoft was good for America, he generally outlined a view that his company has been an engine of progress, which is now in peril.</p>
        <p>''Today's ruling represents an unwarranted intrusion into the software marketplace that has been an engine of growth for the economy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates argued that the company's principal contribution was in transforming what was once a low-volume and high-cost computer industry into a fast-paced, mass market business, in which Microsoft's Windows operating system allowed consumers to benefit from new features that enhanced the power of desktop computing.</p>
        <p>Speaking in front of seven of his top executives -- including Robert J. Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating officer; William H. Neukom, its chief lawyer; Jeff Raikes, a veteran marketing executive; and Mitch Matthews, the current marketing chief -- Mr. Gates said that his most important challenge today was to pursue developments in technologies like speech recognition and computing on tablets.</p>
        <p>He also sought to define the substance of the antitrust case narrowly, saying that at its heart the case was about nothing more than whether his company had the right to add Internet browsing capabilities to its operating systems.</p>
        <p>At one point, while a cluster of more than 30 reporters and television cameramen gathered in front of a large-screen television in the lobby of the Microsoft television studio, glued to a CNN news report on the  judge's ruling, Mr. Gates, clad in a sweater and khakis, strolled past the  press corps and was virtually unnoticed.</p>
        <p>At today's news conference, Mr. Gates answered questions for several minutes before he then turned the meeting over to Microsoft's chief counsel, Mr. Neukom, who proceeded to give a preview of the company's strategy for its appeal, which he said would be filed in a matter of days.</p>
        <p>''I think both the substance of the case and the lack of any process during the remedy phases make a compelling case for our appeal,'' Mr. Neukom said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Neukom, who led the company's defense before federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in the 20-month-long trial, also pointedly attacked the many state attorneys general -- without mentioning them by name -- for foiling the company's attempts to reach a negotiated settlement with the Justice Department during a mediation attempt by Judge Richard A. Posner of the United States Court of Appeals in Chicago several months ago.</p>
        <p>The feelings Mr. Gates expressed today about how his company has been treated unfairly by government prosecutors are echoed among Microsoft's 34,000 employees.</p>
        <p>On the Redmond campus, there has been a palpable sense in recent months of a closing of ranks, according to a number of Microsoft employees.</p>
        <p>The view here is that Microsoft is  the victim of a small Silicon Valley cabal. This group of industry chieftains were fairly vanquished in the market, Microsoft employees often say, but decided to carry on their war in the courts.</p>
        <p>Moreover, there is a sense in Redmond that the situation was exacerbated by what many here view as the media circus that surrounded the antitrust trial.</p>
        <p>''We've become the designated whipping boy for corporate misbehavior,'' said one of the company's top executives. ''It leaves other companies free to merge and engage in all kinds of behaviors without being noticed.''</p>
        <p>Other employees said that there were no surprises for them in today's ruling, even as they insisted that Judge Jackson's decision to endorse the government's proposed breakup was clearly wrongheaded.</p>
        <p>''Given all the media coverage of this, I'm not surprised,'' said George Bullock, a programmer who works for the company's MSDN group, which creates tools for software developers. ''But I wholeheartedly disagree with the government's case.''</p>
        <p>But while there was widespread disappointment over the outcome so far of the case, many employees took issue with Microsoft's contention, made in its last court filing in the case on Tuesday, that a breakup could lead to mass defections among the company's work force.</p>
        <p>''I still believe in Microsoft and I still like what I do here,'' said Franc Camara, a program manager in the company's Windows Division. ''As long as I'm doing something interesting, I don't care if it is broken into two, or three, or four companies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates clearly remains a revered figure in the Seattle area. The case has been closely watched by many of the region's residents, who  can discuss the detailed legal turns and twists in the case with little trouble.</p>
        <p>At the Seattle airport today, Mr. Gates had many fans on his side. ''I think that if the company is split up, it will harm consumers and raise costs,'' said an employee at a rental car counter. ''Tell Bill Gates that Jenny at Avis said 'Hi' and is supporting him.''</p>
        <p>She noted that she owned a small amount of Microsoft stock. When asked about its recent performance, she frowned slightly and turned her thumb down.</p>
