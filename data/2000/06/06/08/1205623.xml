        <p>A LOT of New Yorkers live in small spaces, some smaller than others. My own, for example, measures 250 square feet as the crow walks. Over time, I've become obsessed with making the most of it, getting up at odd hours to stack file cabinets and weed my belongings, even removing doors from hinges. Today, within easy reach, I also  have a sofa, a desk, two chairs, three bureaus and an 18-pound cat named Gus, who takes up more than his fair share of the bed.</p>
        <p>Suburbanites with toolsheds bigger than my apartment may have good reason to wonder whether New Yorkers like me are a bit crazy. But I'm not alone, as I found out when I went in search of other small-apartment lovers in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>While financial concerns force many New Yorkers to cling to small quarters, some actually savor living in the human equivalent of a beehive. Those I met could have moved long ago into much more spacious housing outside the city; the average single-family American home, after all, provides 835 square feet of living space a person, up from 477 square feet 30 years ago, according to the United States Census.</p>
        <p>The city's housing code certainly doesn't coddle the claustrophobic. Section D26-33.03, adopted in 1967, holds that every apartment dweller is entitled to 80 square feet of so-called livable space -- not much bigger than a king-size bed. Though bathrooms aren't figured in, that's still less than the 94 square feet allotted to well-behaved inmates at Attica. Yet, Manhattan seems destined for compact living, and downsizing here has become almost a trend. Costas Kondylis, a well-known architect of residential buildings, said that in New York in the 1980's ''typically, one-bedrooms used to be 750 square feet.'' He added, ''Now on average they are 640, even 625 square feet.''</p>
        <p>The first stop in my search was the 400-square-foot Greenwich Village apartment of Zabel Meshejian. The sign in the elevator put me in the right mood. ''Maximum occupancy 6 people,'' it read, surely a joke given that it measures less than 2 feet by 2 feet.</p>
        <p>Ms. Meshejian works by day as a food stylist, staging photographs for companies like Godiva, Red Lobster and Nabisco. At night, in a galley kitchen, she cooks for herself, drawing from a floor-to-ceiling collection of pots, pans and condiments. ''I have spices for any kind of cuisine,'' Ms. Meshejian said, pointing to wooden cabinets and boxes overflowing with herbs and bottles of oils. ''Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Mediterranean. They're all here.''</p>
        <p>But never mind the challenge of preparing dinner in a closet. It turns out that Ms. Meshejian is also a frustrated gardener, and her apartment seemingly houses more flowerpots than a professional greenhouse. ''I started with one plant, and all of a sudden I had hundreds,'' she said. Tiers of glass shelves in three southern-facing windows catch the afternoon sun, all filled with her favorite miniature plants: euphorbias, haworthias and lithops, kept small and root bound.</p>
        <p>Yet, the apartment, shared with a 19-year-old cat named Munchkin, doesn't seem crowded, just cozy. Antique bureaus, wooden boxes and cookbooks line the perimeter of the living room, while odds and ends -- a parasol, some baskets, family photographs -- take up the rest of the wall space. Everything has a place, even Munchkin, who spends his days dozing in a basket.</p>
        <p>''I have this recurring dream that I go through my closet and discover another room,'' Ms. Meshejian said. Not that she would ever abandon her apartment of 22 years, which is perfectly positioned across the street from a community garden, where she tends her outdoor plants. Indeed, if there's anything besides economics that keeps people chained to small apartments, it's location.</p>
        <p>For Doris Tobias, it all comes down to breezy views of the East River and the United Nations. She lives in a one-bedroom with a little less than 700 square feet and a kitchen the size of a bathtub, not all that unusual -- except that Ms. Tobias happens to be a cookbook author. (''The Golden Lemon,'' published in 1979, is being reissued by iUniverse, and Ms. Tobias is the co-author, with Jean-Paul Picot, of ''La Bonne Soupe Cookbook'' from Macmillan.) She is preparing her next book,  on ''salads that start the meal and salads that are the meal,'' in the same small space.</p>
        <p>''People love to have grandiose, grand-scale kitchens,'' she said, wrinkling her nose. ''It's an act of one-upmanship. They're not for use; they're showy.''</p>
        <p>The alcove that passes for her kitchen houses a standard refrigerator; a diminutive four-burner stove; a Frigidaire minidishwasher; a convection oven barely big enough for an eight-pound turkey; and some wooden cabinets that spill into the living room. A few choice pots and utensils hang at arm's length; basil and rosemary sit in the windowsill, swaying in the breeze.</p>
        <p>''You have to clean up as you go,'' Ms. Tobias added. She not only washes as she cooks, but also prepares parts of the meal ahead of time, running her kitchen like a miniature military barracks. ''Tidiness is space,'' she said. ''You have to work and clean, work and clean.''</p>
        <p>Will she ever move, get a bigger kitchen? Not likely: she's too attached to the neighborhood, where she has lived since 1979. ''Things have changed,'' she said wistfully. ''But the river is still there, rolling along.''</p>
        <p>Living small isn't for everyone, of course, and it hasn't worked so well for Richard Mason, a short cherubic man who moved into his 15-by-15-foot studio apartment in 1957, when he was 30. At first, he said, the size of the place didn't matter. He and his friends ''had great parties,'' he continued, adding, ''We had 25 people over at one time.''</p>
        <p>Later, he acquired a house on Long Island near Hofstra University, where he taught theater, and he used the apartment only on weekends. But when he retired, he moved back. Now, ''It's really a challenge to live here,'' he said, pointing to shelves that cling like barnacles to every wall. ''There's not a square inch that your eye will rest on that I actually haven't done something to.''</p>
        <p>Despite such efforts, as he sees it, he needs professional design help. ''For years now I've been trying to neaten this place,'' he said, but it is always ''on the threshold of continuing chaos.''</p>
        <p>Some savor the chaos. Surprisingly, I found that includes families. My final stop was at the home of Ursula and Nilo Mitra, who live on Pomander Walk, a 1920's gated community of miniature Tudor row houses lining a blocklong pedestrians-only alley that runs from 94th Street to 95th Street between Broadway and West End Avenue. Their  600-square-foot apartment on a single floor has two tiny bedrooms, with a  home office in the parents' room and a library lining their son's bedroom walls. There is a modest dining/living room area and a kitchenette wedged into a walk-in closet.</p>
        <p>The Mitras, who arrived from separate dwellings a few years ago, are the first to raise a child on Pomander Walk in more than 20 years. Ms. Mitra works as bookbinder; her husband, who has a doctorate in particle physics, works for Ericsson, which makes cell phones. Their son, Amitav, is 2 and will be joined by a baby sister in October. Two cats (Samantha and Nimbus), plus a sometime nanny, round out the household.</p>
        <p>''Dinner is crazy around here,'' Mrs. Mitra said. And privacy is practically nonexistent. ''There are no real borders in this place, except maybe our bedroom,'' she said. And that doubles as an office, with a hardwood partition the couple designed themselves. The floor-to-ceiling unit contains a clothes closet, a file cabinet, several bookshelves and drawers for linens. Another storage unit, also of their own design, wraps around one of the windows, providing space for china and a collection of vases.</p>
        <p>The Mitras store bulk purchases of diapers, toilet paper and canned goods off-site in Ms. Mitra's studio in Hoboken. When they get restless, there is always Central Park. ''We spend half of every day out there,' Mrs. Mitra said. ''Amitav loves the sandbox.''</p>
        <p>The Mitras can afford to move out, but they are attached to their community And they are inured. Both grew up in small spaces: Mr. Mitra in India, where extended families make privacy a luxury; Mrs. Mitra, in an apartment in Germany with three siblings. ''My father was the only one who had a private room,'' she said, recalling his study.</p>
        <p>As she sees it, small is good for children -- and parents. In big suburban homes, she said, ''the child is often in the farthest corner of the house.''</p>
        <p>''Far too much responsibility is shifted away from the parents and put elsewhere,'' she added.  ''Part of being responsible is being there and seeing what's going on with your kid.''</p>
        <p>She laughed. ''That is not a problem in a place like this.''</p>
