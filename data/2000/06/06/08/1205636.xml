        <p>If nothing else, the ''MTV Movie Awards'' proves to be terrific public relations for Tom Cruise (as if he needs any). Playing himself, in a sly spoof of ''behind the scenes'' documentaries, he is the foil for Tom Crooze, his overeager stunt double, whom Ben Stiller portrays astutely, with grasping self-importance.</p>
        <p>Crooze is a familiar Hollywood type: the underling who mistakes his association with stars for actual stardom. Dressed in classic Cruise-wear (black T-shirt, black jeans, black sunglasses), the Stiller character says haughtily to the fight director for ''M:I-2'': ''I've done 14 films with Tom. I have a pretty good idea of what Tom wants.'' Of course, what Tom wants -- and gets -- is for Crooze to step in when it's time for a fist to make contact with Mr. Cruise's face. But he's also sympathetic to his double's plight. Flashing his best movie star smile, Mr. Cruise says of Crooze, ''He's harmless.'' The spoof works so well that Mr. Cruise's magnanimity feels authentic, not scripted.</p>

        <p>If nothing else, the ''MTV Movie Awards'' proves to be terrific public relations for Tom Cruise (as if he needs any). Playing himself, in a sly spoof of ''behind the scenes'' documentaries, he is the foil for Tom Crooze, his overeager stunt double, whom Ben Stiller portrays astutely, with grasping self-importance.</p>
        <p>Crooze is a familiar Hollywood type: the underling who mistakes his association with stars for actual stardom. Dressed in classic Cruise-wear (black T-shirt, black jeans, black sunglasses), the Stiller character says haughtily to the fight director for ''M:I-2'': ''I've done 14 films with Tom. I have a pretty good idea of what Tom wants.'' Of course, what Tom wants -- and gets -- is for Crooze to step in when it's time for a fist to make contact with Mr. Cruise's face. But he's also sympathetic to his double's plight. Flashing his best movie star smile, Mr. Cruise says of Crooze, ''He's harmless.'' The spoof works so well that Mr. Cruise's magnanimity feels authentic, not scripted.</p>
        <p>The awards show also offers an amusing animated satire. As punishment for misbehaving at school, the characters from ''South Park'' face Maximus, the hero of the hit ''Gladiator.'' Just as Maximus prepares to impale them on his sword, John Travolta drops in from outer space with a crew of Scientologists, a nod to ''Battlefield Earth,'' the new Travolta movie based on the L. Ron Hubbard novel.</p>
        <p>As for the rest, at least it's brief -- 90 minutes, compared with the numbing four-hour Oscar presentation -- which is an advantage of a taped, edited program versus live television. In that vein, give the best presenter award to Nicolas Cage for admirable succinctness. After striding briskly onstage and apologizing for the laryngitis that attractively thickened his voice, Mr. Cage yelled out his line: ''They've all been kissed, chased, stalked and double-crossed, and for their hard work they've all been nominated for best female performance!'' Cut to the clips.</p>
        <p>The show began eight years ago as a frisky alternative to the Oscars, with awards categories like best kiss and best fight. The prize remains a bucket of gilded popcorn, reflecting the populist leanings of the awards. Nominees are distinctly not high-minded. ''American Beauty,'' which swept the Oscars, was a blip at the MTV proceedings, a failed contender for best movie, nothing more. Perhaps honoring the show's desire to be unconventional, MTV viewers -- who decide the winners -- gave the best  kiss award to two women, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma Blair, for their vigorous bussing in ''Cruel Intentions.''</p>
        <p>But except for a more casual, sometimes ostentatiously sloppy dress code, the MTV awards conform to many Hollywood standards. Lists were pulled from pockets so the appropriate parties could be thanked, including agents, of course.</p>
        <p>Mark Wahlberg offered the only political note. Presenting the best villain award with George Clooney, he said, ''Let's give it to Charlton Heston for being the head of the N.R.A.'' Instead, the prize went to Mike Myers for ''Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''</p>
        <p>Poor Sarah Jessica Parker seemed rightfully uncomfortable with her role as spokesmodel. Mocking the Oscar obsession with dresses, she changed outfits 12 times, appearing onstage in a bizarre collection of revealing concoctions. But they weren't as silly as the most outrageous Oscar get-ups, so the joke  fizzles.</p>
        <p>Though many of these costumes were extremely revealing, none were as embarrassing as the decision to have Ms. Parker flirt awkwardly with Mr. Clooney, rocking back and forth in one of her many gowns like a giggling teenager.</p>
        <p>She was far more at ease playing a more familiar role, in an opening sequence that managed to combine ''Sex and the City'' with ''The Matrix.'' While no Billy Crystal, she also was charming as she performed a singing homage to last year's films. ''They filled us with joy and laughter and hope for a better tomorrow,'' she says with mock sincerity, before singing the wistful ''Imagination'' from ''Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'' to a backdrop of gory and grotesque film clips.</p>
        <p>More frequently, however, vulgarity was substituted for irreverence and foul language mistaken for wit. If a smart joke had replaced every obscenity, the show would have been hilarious. Instead, it's often merely crude.</p>
