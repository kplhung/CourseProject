        <p>Letter by Arnie Huberman responds to June 1 article on computer gamers; says he got taste of what he calls predatory practice by Microsoft when it bought site, www.zone.com, and restricted access to persons using a PC running Windows or using Internet Explorer</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Gamers got a foretaste of the world of Microsoft several years ago. The Internet Gaming Zone was just as David Kushner described it (''Stop Chatting and Deal, Grandpa,'' June 1): a place for people to play games like hearts, spades and chess, while maintaining an ongoing conversation at the bottom of the screen.</p>
        <p>It allowed me, for example, to play chess with my son, even though I was in New York City and he was at Indiana University. We played in real time with real-time chat. It also let me relax with cyberfriends.</p>

        <p>Microsoft bought the site (www.zone.com) from the entrepreneurs who started it in 1995, and within a year, access to the site was allowed only if you (a) used a PC running Windows 95 and (b) used Internet Explorer. Since my son and I used Macs, we were cut off, as well as being cut off from all the online friends we had made. That, to me, was predatory.</p>
