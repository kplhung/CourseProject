        <p>Larry Bird decided before Game 1 that trying to stop Shaquille O'Neal outright was useless.

        <p>Larry Bird decided before Game 1 that trying to stop Shaquille O'Neal outright was useless. So Bird, the coach of the Indiana Pacers, would concede points to O'Neal, the game's most awesome physical presence, and make the other Los Angeles Lakers beat his team -- a strategy employed often against Michael Jordan in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>But with O'Neal's every unmolested spin toward the baseline, with each soft hook and violent dunk, Bird had to know: it did not work then in the National Basketball Association finals and it does not work now.</p>
        <p>O'Neal devoured Reggie Miller's shot attempts tonight. He made 21 of the 31 field goals he took himself. He had 43 points, 19 rebounds, 3 blocked shots, 4 assists. When the game was mercifully done, O'Neal, the league's reigning most valuable player, had nearly swallowed the Pacers whole, powering the Lakers to a 104-87 victory at the Staples Center.</p>
        <p>Having taken a 1-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game finals, the Lakers are host to Game 2 on Friday night -- at which time Bird and the Pacers may have to re-evaluate how to defend O'Neal.</p>
        <p>The Laker center gave Indiana advice. ''I wouldn't,'' he said. ''I would just go home. I'd fake an injury or something.''</p>
        <p>Bird said: ''He was powerful, he was overpowering. He put on a one-man show. He just took over the game. I don't know what, but we're going to have do something.''</p>
        <p>Miller turned in one of the most disappointing games of his 95-game playoff career, hitting just 1 of 16 shots and going scoreless for nearly two and a half quarters before finishing with 7 points. Flustered by the defense of Ron Harper and Kobe Bryant, he never found the spacing or rhythm he needed to get on track.</p>
        <p>The Pacers made a dramatic run in the third quarter, trimming a 15-point lead to 71-69 with less than two minutes left. But as the Lakers have done throughout the playoffs, they lost their focus on offense and hung their heads on defense as the third quarter wore on. A lead of 67-52 began dissipating and nearly was gone.</p>
        <p>With Miller struggling badly, Mark Jackson started penetrating as if he were directing traffic at St. John's University in the 1980's. Breaking Bryant down on defense by backing in with a high power dribble or merely waiting for his teammates to come open on a staggered fast break, he brought the Pacers back.</p>
        <p>A 17-4 binge featured 8 points by Jackson. In all, he had 10 points and 3 assists in the quarter; he wound up leading the Pacers with 18 points.</p>
        <p>Jackson's knifing reverse layup with less than two minutes left in the quarter cut the Lakers' margin to 2, a development that quieted the crowd and raised all the lack-of-desire issues about the Lakers.</p>
        <p>It was then that O'Neal and Bryant made sure they finished the task. Bryant sandwiched two hanging pull-up jump shots between the defining block of the game by O'Neal to give the Lakers a 75-69 lead heading into the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Miller, trying so hard to get going offensively, seemed to have a lane on the left wing. He began dribbling in when he was startlingly met by the leaping O'Neal. Lofting his shot high enough to clear the painted square above the rim, Miller felt confident that the shot would escape O'Neal's fingertips.</p>
        <p>It did not. As the ball approached its apex, O'Neal sent it back to the floor, the sequence sending his towel-waving teammates and the fans into an uproar. Their protagonist had rejected the league's most prominent villain the way the Lakers rejected the Pacers' attempt to steal Game 1.</p>
        <p>O'Neal was not done. With less than five minutes left in the quarter, he had as many points (8) as the Pacers did.</p>
        <p>Before the Pacers found life at the end of the third quarter, O'Neal dominated. Backing in against Rik Smits or simply jumping over the Indiana front line, he could not be defended.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what you do,'' Harper said. ''Maybe try the Hack-a-Shaq and go from there. ''Until you stop Shaq, we're going to go to Shaq. Again. And again.''</p>
        <p>Lakers forward Rick Fox said: ''I can't imagine they would try to play Shaq like that again. They wanted to see what he could do. Now that they've seen it, I don't think they'll be a lot of single coverage. It wouldn't be a choice of mine.''</p>
        <p>O'Neal's 43 points were the most by a Laker in the finals since Wilt Chamberlain scored 45 in 1970.</p>
        <p>Jackson had said before the series that the Pacers were decided underdogs. ''They've got a lot of Goliaths and we have a lot of Davids,'' he said. ''We also brought a lot of slingshots.''</p>
        <p>But Miller forgot his weapons, returning to the player who made 3 of 18 shots in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals last season.</p>
        <p>Miller came home to his native Los Angeles for the first time in the playoffs -- he starred at U.C.L.A. -- and had one of the most forgettable performances in his 13-year career.</p>
        <p>Each time Miller went to the basket, he was swarmed. With less than four minutes left, he appeared to have another open lane on the right side of the basket. But in a blink, the Lakers converged and he threw up an awful-looking, off-balance left-handed layup.</p>
        <p>As the ball caromed off the back rim, the crowd began to chant, ''Cher-yl, Cher-yl!'' in derisive homage to Miller's older sister, Cheryl Miller.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, on the other end, Brian Shaw caught O'Neal spinning toward the rim out of the corner of his eye. He lobbed the ball, and O'Neal caught it and dunked.</p>
        <p>As the final minutes wound down, Bird and the Pacers had yet another difficult question to answer. How to start Miller?</p>
        <p>It can't be nearly as rough as slowing O'Neal, the 7-foot-1-inch, 330-pound man who plays inches from the rim.</p>
        <p>''One of the last true centers left,'' he said after the game tonight. ''If my shot keeps falling, we're going to be hard to beat.''</p>
