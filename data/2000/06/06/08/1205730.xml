        <p>U.S. Judge Orders Breakup Of Microsoft Into 2 Units  A federal judge ordered the breakup of Microsoft, saying the severe remedy was necessary because Microsoft ''has proved untrustworthy in the past'' and did not appear to accept his ruling that it had broadly violated the nation's antitrust laws.</p>
        <p>Under his order, Microsoft would be broken into separate companies, one for its Windows operating system and one for its other businesses. Microsoft would also be forced to comply with restrictions on its conduct. The order stays the breakup plan, but not the other measures, pending an appeal. [Page A1.]</p>

        <p>U.S. Judge Orders Breakup Of Microsoft Into 2 Units  A federal judge ordered the breakup of Microsoft, saying the severe remedy was necessary because Microsoft ''has proved untrustworthy in the past'' and did not appear to accept his ruling that it had broadly violated the nation's antitrust laws.</p>
        <p>Under his order, Microsoft would be broken into separate companies, one for its Windows operating system and one for its other businesses. Microsoft would also be forced to comply with restrictions on its conduct. The order stays the breakup plan, but not the other measures, pending an appeal. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>As Microsoft assesses the implications of the breakup order, the advice from professional communicators on how the company ought to handle the consequences is being offered almost as quickly as the ''I Love You'' computer worm infested e-mail in-boxes. [C8.]</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T Puts Off Its Rate Increase  AT&amp;T gave in to pressure from embarrassed federal regulators and outraged consumer groups and said that it would put off a planned rate increase that would have raised telephone bills for tens of millions of customers. The announcement came after a flurry of calls between senior AT&amp;T executives and the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, William E. Kennard. [A1.]</p>
        <p>A Bitter Showdown in Indonesia  Two days after Indonesia's central bank governor was named as a suspect in a financial scandal, he and the government squared off in a bitter showdown that could erode what little confidence investors have in this fragile country. The governor of Bank Indonesia, Syahril Sabirin, left, said he would not step down despite repeated requests from Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid. Mr. Sabirin denied any wrongdoing and said he was a victim of a political witch hunt. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Technology Issues Bolster Stocks  Paced by technology issues, stock prices resumed their climb. A jump in I.B.M. after a positive analyst report accounted for about 60 percent of the Dow Jones industrial average's rise of 77.29 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,812.86. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 82.89 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,839.26. And the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 13.52 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,471.36. [C15.]</p>
        <p>Big Board in Talks on Global Link  The New York Stock Exchange is discussing the creation of a single global stock market that would electronically connect the trading systems of a half-dozen major exchanges from Tokyo to Toronto. Such a market could provide investors worldwide with one-stop access to exchanges that list companies with a total market value of $20 trillion. [C14.]</p>
        <p>Auditors Agree to Portfolio Review  In response to an inquiry into possible breaches in the independence of corporate auditors, the Big Five accounting firms have agreed to open up the investment portfolios of their partners and top managers to the Securities and Exchange Commission in exchange for immunity from enforcement. [C15.]</p>
        <p>Salon.com Dismisses 13 Employees  Salon.com, one of the highest-profile Web magazines, dismissed 13 employees in an effort to make up an anticipated $7 million shortfall in its $35 million budget. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Consumer Credit Up 7.8% in April  Americans increased their borrowing at a less feverish pace in April, ringing up the smallest rise in consumer credit in six months, the Federal Reserve said. Total consumer credit rose a seasonally adjusted $9.3 billion in April for an annual growth rate of 7.8 percent. That was the smallest gain since October, when borrowing rose by $5.3 billion. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Complacency on the Trade Deficit  Every time the trade deficit reaches another record, as it did in March, economists generally say there is little, perhaps nothing, to worry about. But the rising level of debt is not sustainable indefinitely. Why are we so complacent? Jeff Madrick: Economic Scene. [C2.]</p>
