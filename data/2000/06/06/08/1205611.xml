        <p>ON the small screen -- no, not television's, but the personal computer's -- Ashley Power is becoming a big star. And yes, that's her real name.</p>
        <p>Ashley, a 15-year-old from Southern California who posts her experiences, her schoolgirl insights and her Hollywood good looks on her Web site (www.goosehead .com), is starting to be recognized these days with a chorus of ''Hey, isn't she that girl on the Internet?''</p>
        <p>She created her site after an especially trying eighth grade, she said in a recent interview in her Goosehead.com office in Studio City, Calif., north of Los Angeles. The site features message boards oriented toward teenagers, weekly chats with Ashley, digital games and music for downloading, free e-mail and a homework-helper page with links to an online dictionary, a thesaurus and language translation services.</p>
        <p>But the site's breakout hit is ''Whatever,'' an episodic offering of original comedy, delivered by streaming video with considerable attitude. Goosehead.com attracts more than 100,000 visitors a day.</p>
        <p>Asked about her success, Ashley said: ''This stuff is so amazing to me. It has so blown my mind that I can't even comprehend it.''</p>
        <p>''Whatever'' stars Ashley and is written by her and her stepfather, Mark Schilder (who is also the director). The popularity of the 15-minute episodes has attracted the attention of the actor Richard Dreyfuss, who joined Goosehead.com as a partner this spring to help create more Web-based shows. (Mr. Dreyfuss's brother is the business partner of Ashley's mother, Michelle Schilder, an advertising executive.)</p>
        <p>Part of what persuaded him to become involved with the site, he said, was what he described as Ashley's ''purity of vision.''</p>
        <p>''Some people are trying to remember their past, or they are people trying to make money,'' Mr. Dreyfuss said in a telephone interview, talking about some of Goosehead.com's competitors. ''They're certainly not talking to their audience the way Ashley can connect with hers.''</p>
        <p>Ashley's company is now negotiating with two networks about spinning off ''Whatever'' into a television show. Without a hint of self-consciousness, Ashley said she was  determined to make Goosehead.com into a major Web site for teenagers by emphasizing ''quality over quantity, definitely.'' She also said she had always wanted to direct.</p>
        <p>And while the teenage Web maven can merrily chat with laser-sharp clarity about what her site needs to be, Goosehead.com appears to be the product of two different versions of Ashley Power. The first is a girl who, like many others, found her voice online and began sharing it with anyone who would visit her site. The other is an attractive teenager who is the center of a franchise-in-the-making that is capitalizing on the untested star-making muscle of the Internet, an electronic emporium where facts and fantasies are often indistinguishable and sometimes very profitable.</p>
        <p>Almost every section of Goosehead.com opens with a page bearing Ashley's image. One shows a dimple-cheeked girl-next-door,  while another reveals her wearing a tight T-shirt and a pouty expression. In a soft-focus shot on her Homework page, Ashley is  dressed in what looks like a skirt from a Catholic school with thigh-high white stockings more reminiscent of Britney Spears than Esther Dyson.</p>
        <p>''This is Ashley dealing with her own sexuality, trying to show another side of herself,'' said her stepfather, who is an artist and writer who has also shot television commercials. ''We don't want her to do anything totally funky, but we want her to control her own image.''</p>
        <p>Ashley said she didn't understand why anyone would care about how she looked on her site. Like a typical teenager, she said, she frets about her body -- she wishes that she was thinner, or not so tall. But even Goosehead.com's new 14-year-old columnist, Stephanie Joy Pruner, recently wrote about Ashley's ''sex appeal.'' ''I'm tired of seeing a million pictures of Ashley looking like a !#%&amp;$! supermodel!'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ashley said her site was just for herself and her friends when she began Goosehead.com in the fall of 1998.</p>
        <p>Ashley's mother, Michelle Schilder, said Ashley had always been independent. Ms.  Schilder said she was single when she gave birth to Ashley at the age of 18. She carried her baby daughter to class as she completed college. Ms. Schilder said Ashley occupied  herself with paper and crayons.</p>
        <p>''It didn't really surprise me from a creative point of view that she would do creative things with her computer,'' said Ms. Schilder, whose company shares office space with Ashley's company.</p>
        <p>Like many people her age, Ashley practically grew up with a mouse in her hand. She has had a succession of Macintosh computers since she was 8 years old, she said, so she instinctively turned to the Web as a ready means of expression and communication. At 13 she began teaching herself from a book how to write HTML files so she could work on her Web site.</p>
        <p>With e-mail, she found fellow computer geeks, men sometimes three times her age, who eagerly helped her over snags with getting Goosehead.com off the ground and on the Web, she said.</p>
        <p>Today Ashley employs at least a half-dozen of them as partners. One of them is Pat Galvin, 44, who lives in nearby Valencia, Calif. ''I was just trying to be a nice guy,'' he said, recalling when he had first begun answering a flood of e-mail questions from Ashley about building and maintaining Web sites. In the beginning, he said, he did not realize that Ashley was 14. Nonetheless, he recognized that she had ''great vision,'' he said. ''She is extremely sweet,'' he added. ''The smile gets you.''</p>
        <p>When her stepfather learned that Ashley had enlisted the help of men she had met on the Internet, he talked to each of them. Mr. Schilder said he had been satisfied that they sincerely wanted to help Ashley, who then had her site up and was attracting considerable attention among teenagers. He organized a meeting last August in Las Vegas, where all the Webmasters -- some lived as far away as Florida and Ohio, and each paid his own way -- met to map out a strategy for Goosehead.com.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to have Ashley talking to everyone in the room,'' Mr. Schilder said. ''I wanted to see how they responded to Ashley.''</p>
        <p>Goosehead.com was incorporated last November. The site's name comes from a childhood incident when Ashley accidentally decapitated a cement goose that decorated the family's front lawn. Even before Goosehead.com was incorporated, Ashley listed it with some of the Web's most popular search engines. As a result, it started getting 40,000 hits a day and tidal waves of e-mail messages, sometimes thousands in a day.</p>
        <p>In a matter of months, Ashley's site had propelled her (with the guidance of her stepfather's business sense) into the hyperspeed world of the Internet entrepreneur. As the founder and chief executive of Goosehead.com., she had moved in blazing Internet time from being a computer geek (with a mother and a stepfather who quickly recognized the site's potential) to being the soul of an Internet portal for teenagers, a business with 31 employees, 22 of them working full time for Goosehead.com.</p>
        <p>Along with ''Whatever,'' Goosehead.com's programming includes installments from Ivan Tell, a roving teenage reporter who turns in pithy dispatches as he roams Los Angeles in a 1963 Cadillac convertible. More shows are in production, Ashley said, like ones called ''Cornman,'' a mock documentary about a zoologist tracking down a Bigfoot-like creature, and ''The Janitor,'' which follows a school custodian who fantasizes about being a superhero.</p>
        <p>''She has really created a clear personality for the site,'' said Jeff Thomas, a marketing team leader at iSyndicate, an online  syndication service based in San Francisco that provides Goosehead.com with content like its movie page. ''It's really a kind of unique thing. It feels like there's a real teenager in there.''</p>
        <p>Production on new episodes of ''Whatever'' began last week. The mounting workload means that Ashley works on Goosehead.com business not just because she wants to but also because she has to, she said. The site generates most of its revenue from corporate partnerships and advertising, said Mr. Schilder, who is co-chairman of the company.</p>
        <p>Goosehead.com is also dipping its corporate toe into e-commerce by selling T-shirts and caps bearing the site's logo, a smiling cartoon goose face. While the site has yet to make a profit, Ashley and her family are not discouraged.</p>
        <p>''We are spending money faster than we are getting it,'' Ms. Schilder said, ''but we are in a position to make money very soon.''</p>
        <p>Ashley said her company was securing investment capital, and she predicted a future for her Web site that would be as bright as a smog-free California noon.</p>
        <p>She knows that much of the responsibility for Goosehead.com's success rests on her shoulders, she said. As a result, Ashley said, she occasionally has to miss school to attend an important business meeting or deliver a speech to an Internet group. Her grades have suffered, she said, which is something her teachers have prodded her about.</p>
        <p>''I just hang in there,'' she said. ''I keep going with what I feel is right in my heart.''</p>
