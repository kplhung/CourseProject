        <p>Russia's lower house of Parliament approved President Vladimir V. Putin's proposal to impose a flat income tax of 13 percent, providing the new president his first victory in economic reform. The rate will take effect on Jan. 1 and will replace the current three-tiered rate that requires the country's wealthiest to pay a 30 percent tax on income. The bill is expected to pass a final reading before Parliament breaks for the summer on July 11. Deputies have extended their session for two weeks to complete work on Mr. Putin's tax package, which would reduce the tax burden on business by about 20 percent.</p>
