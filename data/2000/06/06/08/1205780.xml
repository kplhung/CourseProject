        <p>I was amused to read the essay by Mike Wendland's called ''Reading the News in the Inkless World of Cyberspace'' (May 25). Twenty years ago, when I was in journalism school, a professor predicted that one day we would all be reading our news on computer screens. I pooh-poohed the idea, saying that reading on a screen could never replace the feel of a newspaper in hand at the breakfast table.</p>

        <p>I was amused to read the essay by Mike Wendland's called ''Reading the News in the Inkless World of Cyberspace'' (May 25). Twenty years ago, when I was in journalism school, a professor predicted that one day we would all be reading our news on computer screens. I pooh-poohed the idea, saying that reading on a screen could never replace the feel of a newspaper in hand at the breakfast table.</p>
        <p>Today, I sit in front of my computer with my morning cup of tea and get all my news from the Web, except for Sunday, when I revert to the pleasures of print. No more stacks of newspapers cluttering the house. But Mr. Wendland's wife has a point about missing the ads.</p>
