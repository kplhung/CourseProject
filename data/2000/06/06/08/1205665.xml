        <p>IT has become one of the most familiar refrains in economic circles. Every time the trade deficit reaches yet another record, as it did again this March, economists generally assure us that there is little, perhaps nothing, to worry about.</p>
        <p>We've dealt with high trade deficits for 20 years, the argument goes, and we're still the leading economy in the world. But in recent years, the deficit has actually been growing considerably faster than has the economy itself. And when Americans buy more from abroad than at home, someone in the United States must borrow those dollars from foreigners. As a result, the nation's foreign debt is rising faster than its income. And as the economy begins to slow at last, the question becomes more urgent because slower growth may persuade global investors to put their money elsewhere. The rising level of debt is not sustainable indefinitely.</p>
        <p>Why are we so complacent? One reason is that a couple of misleading half-truths have become conventional wisdom.</p>
        <p>The first of these is that, contrary to what you may have thought, the trade deficit really reflects America's economic strength, not any inability to compete on the part of companies in the United States. This year, Americans are buying in excess of $300 billion more from foreigners than they will buy from the United States, so the argument goes, because this nation is so much better off than the rest of the world. If only foreign economies were as strong as America's.  Then their companies and consumers would buy more American goods.</p>
        <p>But, in truth, if foreign consumers and investors suddenly bought another $300 billion from the United States, Americans companies could not handle it. Labor markets are tight and business is already running full out, so an increase in production of roughly 3 percent of the nation's economic output would be inflationary.</p>
        <p>''People often seem to forget that because we are approaching the limits to capacity,'' says Wynne Godley, senior economist at the Jerome Levy Institute at Bard College, ''an increase in foreign demand would have to be matched by a comparable decrease in consumption by Americans.''</p>
        <p>Secondly, we are invariably told that the trade deficit merely reflects America's record low savings rate. This is true as far as it goes. When Americans save so little, the nation must attract enormous sums of capital from overseas to fuel investment.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, right now foreigners are willing to lend a lot of money to the United States, as well as buy American stocks. This helps keep the value of the dollar high, which stimulates imports by pushing prices down and restrains exports by driving their prices up. According to this reasoning, the trade deficit is simply a trivial side effect.</p>
        <p>But it does not follow from this that all the United States needs to do is to raise its savings rate and everything would be fine. If the savings rates were to sharply improve, consumers would spend much less. The lower spending, in turn, would substantially reduce output and employment in the economy, running the risk of outright recession.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, these half-truths drown out more useful discussions about ways to improve America's ability to produce what Americans themselves want to buy. Low savings rate or high, Americans like to buy imports more than foreigners like to buy American products. So the trade deficit does to some extent reflect how internationally competitive American companies are.</p>
        <p>In her comprehensive book ''Is the U.S. Trade Deficit Sustainable?'' Catherine L. Mann of the Institute for International Economics shows clearly that as Americans make more money, a higher proportion of their purchases is from abroad.</p>
        <p>How to correct this? An unusually high dollar, which the Clinton administration has favored because it simultaneously restrains inflation and attracts foreign investment, only makes these matters worse. It reduces incentives to invest in export-producing companies by keeping prices for these goods unduly high to foreigners. It also reduces incentives to invest in American companies that compete with imports by keeping those prices low.</p>
        <p>America's inherent competitive advantages would also be better served, especially in the new economy, if the nation invested more effectively in its human capital, in research and development and in infrastructure. At least in part, this will require the efforts of government.</p>
        <p>But those who believe that trade deficits merely reflect the low savings rate insist that any budget surpluses be used to pay down Treasury debt. In the short run, this would raise the nation's total savings, they argue, but what they ignore is that it would also forgo the best opportunity in decades to improve the nation's competitive potential through needed public investment.</p>
        <p>Because Americans have lived for so long with a high trade deficit, many seem to believe we have plenty of time to correct the problem. Aside from a new commission established by Congress to review the trade deficit, there is little serious policy discussion of the issue among Democrats or Republicans, or even among prominent economists.</p>
        <p>The current hope -- and it is no more than that -- is for a soft landing. Foreign economies will grow a little faster and gradually increase America's exports. The American economy will slow down moderately, and American consumers will buy fewer imports. The dollar may also fall slightly, thus stimulating more exports.</p>
        <p>In sum, the trade deficit will not be eliminated, but at least it will be dented. America's relentless borrowing from abroad will be tempered, and, well, the problem will be postponed if not solved.</p>
        <p>But the situation is more delicate than that. The debt Americans now owe overseas investors, Mr. Godley figures, has risen to more than 20 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, easily a record. Even Ms. Mann, a gradualist, believes America may have only a few years to reverse the current trends.</p>
        <p>If the economy does indeed begin to slow even moderately, Ms. Mann and Mr. Godley -- no ideological bedfellows -- both agree that foreign investors may want to rebalance their portfolios (as might domestic investors) in favor of the securities of other countries. This would place downward pressure on the dollar and stock prices, and there is no telling when a small outflow of funds could turn into a run, especially given the stock market's anxious condition.</p>
        <p>The complacent attitude among economists about the trade deficit was originally a response to exaggerated fears in the past when America was a creditor. But now that it is a debtor, the nation no longer enjoys such a luxury.</p>
