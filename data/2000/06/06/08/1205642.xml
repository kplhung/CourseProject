        <p>Most college-bound students have access to the Internet and use it voraciously to help them decide what schools to apply to, but they still consider human contact most important in the process, according to a survey that will be released next week.</p>
        <p>The survey by Art &amp; Science Group polled 500 high school seniors who intended to apply to four-year colleges and found that 94 percent of the students had Web access, a leap from 30 percent among students polled four years ago.</p>
        <p>The survey also showed that the use of computers and the Web for the college application process did not differ greatly between white students and minority students, although the study did not differentiate between blacks, Asian-Americans or other ethnic groups.</p>
        <p>Not a single respondent said he did not have access to a computer anytime he wanted one, whether at home or school, said Richard A. Hesel, publisher of Art &amp; Science, which is sponsored by Embark.com, an online applications company.</p>
        <p>When students were asked how they gathered information, 48 percent said from guidance counselors and 37 percent said from Web sites, while others mentioned friends, books or parents. When asked what was most influential in deciding where to enroll, campus visits was first, followed by parents and Web sites.</p>

        <p>NEWS WATCH  Correction:  June 16, 2000, Friday  A report in the News Watch column of Circuits on June 8 about a survey of 500 students on ways in which they used the Internet when selecting colleges included an erroneous reference to its sponsorship and to the role of Richard A. Hesel, who commented on the extent of the students' Web access. The poll was sponsored by an online educational services company, Embark.com, and conducted by the Art &amp; Science Group. Mr. Hesel, who works for the Art &amp; Science Group, published the results. He is not the publisher of the group, and the group is not sponsored by Embark.com.</p>
