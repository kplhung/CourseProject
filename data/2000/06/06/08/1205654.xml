        <p>Greta Garbo, playing the depressed ballerina Grusinskaya in the 1932 movie ''Grand Hotel,'' discovered a jewel thief in her room and delivered what became her signature line: ''I vant to be alone.''</p>
        <p>I'm with Garbo. What with cell phones and palm pilots and satellite-controlled pagers and messagers, the world is too much with us. In our lust to be in constant hand-held communication, we fritter away our long-held value of personal freedom.</p>
        <p>Yes, if you are lost on a rainy night, a car phone is a blessing. If you are trying to file copy from remote Chechnya, a link in hand via satellite offers an escape hatch for truth. And if you are stuck in traffic and late for a family party or a crucial meeting, the wireless gizmos enable you to signal, as did General Sherman atop Kenesaw Mountain: ''Hold the fort! I am coming!''</p>
        <p>But use in emergencies does not account for the cellumania that has fastened itself to our ears and belts. Something more troubling is at its root. Too many of us are gripped by the fear of being alone. If we are not in demand round the clock, goes this worry, we don't count.</p>
        <p>That mass separation anxiety is driven by a curious culture that demands we all form a circle and hold hands. If you are out of pocket, you are considered to be somewhat out to lunch. If you are off the scope, society thinks you must be off your rocker. Detachment is suspect.</p>
        <p>The individual's normal desire to stay in touch has, with a shove from technology, led to society's relentless pressure never to be out of touch. As a result, the world is too much with us; we lay waste our power to be by ourselves.</p>
        <p>Is the tintinnabulation of bells at restaurants and in theaters suddenly turning me into some kind of hermit? No; three decades ago I rejected the earliest electronic pager. At a Moscow summit meeting, President Nixon's aides were issued this invention by which the chief executive could reach his entire staff at all times and in all places.</p>
        <p>The chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, demanded to know why I was the only one to refuse to wear the new pager. I replied that I did not want to feel like a dog on a leash. He shook his head, but made a beckoning motion with his fingers, as if to say: Couldn't I come up with a better reason than privacy?</p>
        <p>So I lied. The sound and vibration of the pager on my belt, I offered, would give me an urgent desire to urinate. He nodded and took back the pager: ''You have a medical excuse.''</p>
        <p>Now that wirelessness is next to godliness, what excuses can we come up with to slip today's electronic leashes?</p>
        <p>Forget courtesy, civility, concern for others around you; those old-fashioned reasons are blown away by the new info-age necessity for constant contact. See that couple in a restaurant, each talking on a cell phone to someone else? For us to insist they talk only to each other would take the steam out of their self-esteem.</p>
        <p>Rather, consider the cell phone's destruction of the wall between work and leisure. Used to be, when you went to work, you worked; when you commuted, you thought about working or planned about playing; and when you got home, you could forget work and make whoopee.</p>
        <p>Now, even when you are cultivating your garden, you are on call and on edge; and when you are whispering into your hand at work, your boss wonders if you may be playing. As differentiation frays, stress builds; life becomes a blur, and where there is no real recreation, there is little creation.</p>
        <p>When a friend is late for an appointment, what do cellumaniacs do? They call to see what's the delay, or scroll furiously through their palm organizers to fill the unforgiving minutes. Not me; I stare at the wall, see beautiful shapes in memory, have a conversation with myself, maybe dream up a column. Ten unexpected minutes for contemplation is not an insult; it can be a gift.</p>
        <p>When Garbo said, ''I vant to be alone,'' the jewel thief, played by John Barrymore, replied, ''Let me stay just for a little while.'' Garbo murmured, ''Just for a minute, then,'' and was seduced.</p>
        <p>Savor occasional solitude. Don't give in to cellumania. Not for a minute.</p>
