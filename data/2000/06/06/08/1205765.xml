        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he had tried to meet twice in recent days to express sympathy belatedly to the family of Patrick M. Dorismond, the unarmed black man shot dead earlier this year by the police.

        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he had tried to meet twice in recent days to express sympathy belatedly to the family of Patrick M. Dorismond, the unarmed black man shot dead earlier this year by the police. But the mayor said he backed away from the meetings because the family wanted its lawyer, Johnnie Cochran, to be present.</p>
        <p>''The mayor was looking for a heart-to-heart, not a deposition-like meeting with a lawyer,'' said Mr. Giuliani's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel.</p>
        <p>But an intermediary for the Dorismond family, the Rev. Brian Jordan, said yesterday that the presence of Mr. Cochran was not necessarily a problem and that the mayor and the Dorismonds were still negotiating ''mutual terms'' for any meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's refusal to express sympathy to the Dorismond family at the time of the shooting in March and his attempt to discredit the victim, which shocked even Republicans, has been called the harshest example of the mayor's aggressive style.</p>
        <p>But not quite three weeks ago, when Mr. Giuliani withdrew from his Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton because of his prostate cancer, the mayor promised to be a better person who would reach out to the minorities he had alienated. Blacks in the city, who are hopeful but skeptical about the mayor's ability to change, are now watching for clues.</p>
        <p>There were signs yesterday of some thawing on both sides. The mother of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed black man who was shot dead by the police last year, said late yesterday that she would meet with Mr. Giuliani if he was willing to reach out to her.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president and a longtime critic of the mayor, met privately with him for an hour at City Hall to discuss the need for community policing, Mr. Ferrer said, as well as policy on schools, housing and jobs. C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, announced yesterday that she and the mayor were to meet today.</p>
        <p>The meetings with Mr. Ferrer and Ms. Fields were both initiated by Mr. Giuliani. Normally such meetings between a mayor and his borough presidents would hardly be news, but Mr. Giuliani has regularly warred with both officials during his years in office. The meeting with Ms. Fields would be their third. Mr. Ferrer said yesterday he could not recall the last time he met with Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>''Do I have any bruises?'' Mr. Ferrer joked afterward. ''No. Nor does he.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferrer pronounced himself  ''very pleased'' with the meeting, but said that he now wanted to see results. ''And that's always where the rubber meets the road,'' Mr. Ferrer said.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Al Sharpton, one of the mayor's angriest critics, added yesterday that he was unimpressed with the mayor's efforts. ''The mayor is being very selective in how he plays 'the new Rudy,' '' Mr. Sharpton said. ''Clearly, he has not met anyone he has not met with in the past.''</p>
        <p>Kadiatou Diallo, Mr. Diallo's mother, said in a telephone interview yesterday that she was speaking out based on ''good faith'' and the mayor's remarks as he withdrew from the Senate race. ''If he wants to do something, then we will have our door opened,'' she said. ''Because we want change. We want to prevent this from happening to other families. The list is long now.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mrs. Diallo and Marie Dorismond, the mother of Mr. Dorismond, met in Albany with Gov. George E. Pataki, who expressed his sympathy and hugged members of the Dorismond family. Mrs. Diallo and Mrs. Dorismond were there with other relatives of victims of New York City police shootings and injuries. The group was in Albany to promote legislation intended to make New York City police officers more racially sensitive and less prone to violence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani made his remarks about the Dorismond family at a brief news conference yesterday morning on the front plaza of City Hall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani quietly began his overtures to the Dorismond family shortly after he withdrew from the race. The negotiations were prompted by Father Jordan, a priest at the Church of St. Francis of Assisi on West 31st Street, who said yesterday that ''I'm a nobody'' and that he knew no one at City Hall.</p>
        <p>But after watching the mayor say he regretted not being more sympathetic to the Dorismonds on a televised public meeting on May 18, the day before he withdrew from the Senate race, Father Jordan began calling Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota.</p>
        <p>To his surprise, Mr. Lhota took his call on May 20th, the day after the mayor withdrew. Father Jordan told Mr. Lhota that he did not know the Dorismonds, but that he did know the family's priest, and that he wanted to act as an intermediary. By May 23, Father Jordan said, Mr. Lhota had called back.</p>
        <p>Father Jordan said he then called the Dorismonds through their priest, Msgr. Rollin Darbouze of the Holy Cross Church in Flatbush. The Dorismonds, Father Jordan said, ''were just interested about my phone call. They didn't say yes or no.''</p>
        <p>''This is not over,'' Father Jordan said. He referred to his own role as ''divine intervention.''</p>
