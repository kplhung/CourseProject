        <p>IF you cut my veins, you'll get cement!'' booms Samuel J. LeFrak, the ubiquitous metropolitan builder, urban visionary (hey, no smirking; he's got knighthoods and honorary doctorates on deluxe business cards announcing him as Sir Samuel), and in his spare time, sugar daddy to the arts.</p>
        <p>Mr. LeFrak, whose $10 million gift to the Guggenheim caused a highbrow riot when the museum wanted to carve his name onto its Frank Lloyd Wright exterior in 1993, is adamant that he was an early discoverer of Barbra Streisand in a LeFrak-built tenement in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>He also recalls throwing a bone to a struggling graphic artist named Andy Warhol ''with that pancake face of his, but he was wonderful.'' So Mr. LeFrak took him to Queens to decorate kitchen and bathroom walls at a Lefrak City model apartment: ''You know, maybe paint a couple of teakettles, something colorful, like a can of Campbell's soup, and in the bathroom, a couple little sailboats and swans. Some nuts painted them over! I can't find them!''</p>
        <p>Now he's discovered New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Probably better to take his word on his inner cement as he holds court in the penthouse of his eponymous office building on Queens Boulevard, postponing his brown-bagged Reuben sandwich, extolling his newest project.</p>
        <p>First Alexander Hamilton, then Horace Greeley, and now Samuel J. LeFrak (he loves connections like that) have espoused a westward ho philosophy.</p>
        <p>''What I say in 2000 is build what they need at a price they can afford and they will come,'' says Mr. LeFrak, who bought his pioneer piece of the action, 600 acres of rail yards and refuse, in 1983 when he noticed Wall Street's growing pains.</p>
        <p>This project is his pinnacle, the one that took a 20-year commitment of the stuff he calls ''blood, sweat and tears'' and a $10 billion investment of the stuff he calls the golden rule.</p>
        <p>As in, ''The guy with the gold, he makes the rules.''</p>
        <p>That guy, with an estimated fortune of $1.7 billion, embellished by the priceless assortment of Picassos, Chagalls, Matisses and van Goghs that liven up his homes in Long Island, Manhattan and London, would be Mr., Dr. or Sir Samuel. Whatever. He answers to them all. Because he owns some 90,000 city apartments and 9,000 more in New Jersey, you're welcome to call him landlord, too.</p>
        <p>Newport, Mr. Lefrak's creation at Jersey City, a place he calls Manhattan West, is part Field of Dreams (attracting players like Paine Webber and Chase Manhattan Bank), part 21st century corporate Versailles, and very much a nose-thumbing exercise at every New York bureaucrat who got in his way since he built his first building on East 14th Street in 1938 before graduating from the University of Maryland.</p>
        <p>NOW 82 and as bombastic and big-pocketed as the day he made his first billion, Mr. LeFrak, best known for erecting utilitarian crash pads for the lunch-pail set, is handling this noontime interrogation like a karaoke volunteer who grabs the mike and won't let go.</p>
        <p>Don't interrupt him with questions! He's fully capable of making up his own tune. Starting with a work ethic that came of 4:30 a.m. milkings on a farm his father soon cut into the grids of Bedford-Stuyvesant. His family motto? Like assets, he's got lots of them: We Serve the Mass, Not the Class; Be a Doer, Not a Reviewer; Dream It, Believe It, Plan It, Achieve It. All his favorite truisms are spelled out on laminated plaques that sit among the cavalcade of family photos on his crowded credenzas: ''My wealth is not what's in the bank,'' he insists.</p>
        <p>''It helps; if you have money. But my wealth is on that credenza. I'm fourth generation, the seventh generation is in the crib, and will be trained. We all know our assignment,'' adds Mr. LeFrak, whose 55-year-old son, downstairs neighbor and alter ego, Richard, has been the company president since 1975. ''Most families like ours,'' he says, meaning dynasties, ''are shirt sleeve to shirt sleeve before the lawyers get in there and destroy everything. That won't happen to us.''</p>
        <p>As he fumbles around his cluttered desk, looking to make a dramatic point with a penknife -- O.K., O.K., he bleeds bricks and mortar, and has since his father, Harry, sent him on his first job at 8 -- but can find only pens. Seems Mr. LeFrak is a bit of a pack rat when it comes to freebie pens, pencils and those little flashlights that Chase, which last week infuriated Manhattan's politicos by jumping ship to Newport, handed out in return for his business ''for what's gotta be a hundred years.''</p>
        <p>Well, not quite. But he's going strong, and retirement is out of the question for this Gray Panther, a firm believer that ''the difference between the men and the boys are the toys.'' Sure, he sold his 55 race horses, in part because Richard was allergic, but he's still got his 94-foot yacht, the grown-up versions of those three model airplanes on his coffee table fly him around, and then there is the artwork that helps him forget the cement in his veins. Van Gogh's tormented, solitary life makes him especially weepy: nothing sadder than an unappreciated genius.</p>
        <p>''I'm one of the dinosaurs, but I'm surviving. And I'm one of the last of the red hot mamas that doesn't believe in trade-ins,'' he says of his 59-year marriage to Ethel Stone, the Barnard girl who smoothed his rough edges and produced his four heirs. To them he says what his parents told him: just be smart and never get caught over-leveraged.</p>
