        <p>Keeping Climbers at Bay</p>
        <p>Q.  There is a creeping plant next to my front porch that a neighbor tells me is a climbing hydrangea. If this is so, I'm afraid it will get too big for the location. (The porch rail is only a few feet high.) But I think I read somewhere about a Japanese ''creeping'' hydrangea. Do you know about such a thing? How big is it likely to get?</p>

        <p>Keeping Climbers at Bay</p>
        <p>Q.  There is a creeping plant next to my front porch that a neighbor tells me is a climbing hydrangea. If this is so, I'm afraid it will get too big for the location. (The porch rail is only a few feet high.) But I think I read somewhere about a Japanese ''creeping'' hydrangea. Do you know about such a thing? How big is it likely to get?</p>
        <p>A.  Whether you have a true climbing hydrangea (Hydrangea anomala ssp. petiolaris) or its near look-alike, the Japanese hydrangea vine (Schizophragma hydrangeoides), growth -- 30 feet or more -- is in the cards.</p>
        <p>Long considered the best climbing vine for its combination of large beautiful flowers, wonderful three-dimensional structure and lustrous dark-green leaves, climbing hydrangea is nearly unlimited in its ability to creep over, scamper onto or climb up anything that its little aerial rootlets can glue themselves to.</p>
        <p>Schizophragma is very similar in appearance and behavior, differing mainly in its hardiness (zone 6), in the details of flower construction and in having a more relaxed, yet still elegant, way of holding its flowers. In addition to the straight species, it is available in several cultivars, including the silvery-leaved Moonlight, the rosy pink-flowered Roseum and Strawberry Leaf. Schizophragma shares climbing hydrangea's shaggy bark for winter appeal, although to a lesser extent. While climbing hydrangea often takes a few years to  bloom, Schizophragma blooms after a couple of years.</p>
        <p>While both of these vines will probably grow too large for your space, they can be pruned to keep them shorter. They bloom on short spurs emerging from last year's growth, so prune them in summer, soon after they flower.</p>
        <p>Controlling the size of your vine will be an annual chore, and you will probably tire of it long before the vine tires of growing. It would be better to move it to a location where it can stretch out and wow you.</p>
        <p>Schizophragma hydrangeoides may not be easy to find. Sources include Windrose, 1093 Mill Road, Pen Argyl, Pa. 18072, (610) 588-1037, catalog $3; and Gossler Farms Nursery, 1200 Weaver Road, Springfield, Ore. 97478, (541) 746-3922, catalog $2.</p>
        <p>Those Gelatinous Blobs</p>
        <p>Q.  While walking by some outdoor flower boxes that are maintained by our local garden club, I noticed transparent, gelatinous blobs nearly covering the soil. I asked a friend, a member of the garden club, who told me it was a water-saving gel added to the soil, and that the recent heavy rains must have caused the problem. Since it looks so peculiar, I am wondering if there is a way to prevent this from happening, and whether the gels are worth the effort?</p>
        <p>A.  Follow the directions and don't expect miracles. Hydrogels, sold at most garden centers under several brand names, are small granules of polyacrylamide or other similar materials, which can absorb up to 400 times their own weight in water. As the soil around them dries out, these water-savers gradually release the water, thus keeping the soil moist. Using them in a well-drained potting mixture can extend the period you don't need to water by two or three days at most.</p>
        <p>Intuitively, you would think using more than the recommended amount (about a teaspoon for an eight-inch pot) would let you water once and take off for a trip around the world, but it doesn't work that way. Using too much can leave the soil soggy and the roots gasping for air. Sorry, the art of watering is still important.</p>
        <p>The other instruction the package will give is not to use the gels in the upper two inches of soil. The manufacturers say the reason is that you want to have the gels down where the roots are, but since the water they release will disperse throughout the pot, the real reason may be to avoid having the water-saturated granules rising to the top like bloated bodies emerging from a lake in a bad mystery.</p>
