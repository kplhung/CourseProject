        <p>Accurate as it would be to call Tony Earley's first novel a radiant, knowing, pitch-perfect parable of childhood, it seems wrong to say things that would make his characters blush.

In this simple setting, which Mr. Earley renders with a wonderful blend of nostalgia and sophistication, the verities discovered by 10-year-old Jim have a way of seeming particularly eternal.</p>

        <p>JIM THE BOY  By Tony Earley  227 pages. Little, Brown. $23.95.</p>
        <p>Accurate as it would be to call Tony Earley's first novel a radiant, knowing, pitch-perfect parable of childhood, it seems wrong to say things that would make his characters blush. Mr. Earley's book is set during the Depression in the modest, folksy North Carolina town of Aliceville, where ''Shoot!'' and ''Daggummit'' and ''You knothead'' are the cuss words in common parlance and a ghostly story still resonates about the little girl for whom the place was named. In this simple setting, which Mr. Earley renders with a wonderful blend of nostalgia and sophistication, the verities discovered by 10-year-old Jim have a way of seeming particularly eternal.</p>
        <p>The expert and irony-free minimalism of ''Jim the Boy'' gives it the plain, wholehearted sound of a book for young readers. But the forthright and sweetly humorous way in which Jim's story unfolds is anything but naive. This book's rural characters seem as carefully chosen as figures in a Greek myth, like the widowed mother who sounds as if she stepped out of a folk song (''Mama was tall and pale and handsome; her neck was long and white'') to watch over her son. The other deities in Jim's universe are the three uncles who during the course of this quick and unexpectedly elegant fable teach Jim everything he needs to know.</p>
        <p>''Y'all know who I am,'' Jim insists on the morning of his 10th birthday when Uncles Al, Coran and Zeno teasingly pretend not to recognize him. ''Can't say that we do,'' Uncle Coran remarks, in a book that, while not without seriousness, seldom sounds any less good-natured than that. It turns out that the twins Al and Coran and their older brother (''His age was considerable, up in the 40's somewhere,'' Jim thinks about Zeno), mean to surprise Jim with a baseball glove and bat, which they present with the characteristically wry understatement that serves as local color.</p>
        <p>''Never seen them before,'' says Uncle Coran, when the glove and Louisville slugger turn up in the middle of the dining room table. ''What are they?''</p>
        <p>Jim's Mama urges the uncles to quit kidding. (''Oh, stop it. Sometimes I could just strangle y'all.'') In the end, it is Zeno, the book's foremost source of wisdom, who ends the birthday celebration on a suitably sweeping note. ''He ain't no bigger than a poot,'' says Zeno, ''but I guess we'll keep him.'' It wouldn't take many poots to tip a book this slender into the realm of sugary down-home charm. But Mr. Earley, whose first book was a collection of short stories, retains the economy and purposefulness that that form demands, as he leads Jim through a series of exploratory ventures beyond the loving shelter of his Aliceville home. The book's landscape and cast of characters are so selectively delineated that each of these forays has the mythic quality of a major undertaking, even on the journey about which ''Uncle Al would say only that they were going to see a man about a dog.''</p>
        <p>This is the trip on which Jim visits a town big enough to have a courthouse, a place that affords a tempting sight. (''Jim could no longer imagine sitting inside a soda shop than in the house of a king, and did not ask Uncle Al to stop.''). It's the time he first sets foot in another state. (''South Carolina,'' said Uncle Al. ''Not much to it, huh?'') And provides Jim with his first experience of the Atlantic Ocean, where he steps into the water (''A fish no bigger than a thought swam by his feet'') and tries to imagine where else that water has been. The beauty of ''Jim the Boy'' lies in its graceful way of describing a boy who is in every way thus poised on the verge of discovery, thrilled and fearful to find new wisdom flooding into his familiar world.</p>
        <p>The course of the book leads Jim to make peace with thoughts of his father, who fell dead in a cotton field the week before Jim was born. It leads him to understand his mother's loneliness, especially when a genial traveling feed salesman named Whitey Whiteside begins to court her. (Wondering about Whitey's presence around his mother made other questions begin ''pulling into his head like trains into a station.'')</p>
        <p>It brings Jim into friendly rivalry with a schoolmate named Penn who fights with him about baseball and makes him see the contrast between Penn's life on a nearby mountain and Jim's life in town. It seems no coincidence that Penn's mother, glimpsed briefly at home, is in a sky-blue dress and a white apron, as if this symbolic setting were indeed part of the clouds. The whole book has the sharp, clean, inviting hyperreality of a detail like that.</p>
        <p>The most daunting figure in Jim's world is the grandfather who will have nothing to do with him and who can also be found somewhere up the mountain. And while it's true that Jim comes to know about pride, competition, racial tension and disabling illness during the course of the story, nothing looms larger for him than the terrifying specter of that mean old man. It is some measure of Mr. Earley's storytelling mettle that he uses Jim's grandfather to generate the book's closing epiphany without remotely reaching for the literary equivalent of a big grandfatherly hug.</p>
        <p>The novel's matter-of-fact-looking cover illustration ably conveys the meaning of this last episode. Yet this picture, like the story itself, has the stealth aspect of something intended for young readers in an innocent, less cynical time. In fact, ''Jim the Boy'' is anything but quaint. Mr. Earley may not have invented the coming-of-age novel, but he streamlines and reawakens the genre with this swift, lovely book.</p>
