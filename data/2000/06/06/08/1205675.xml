        <p>With the success of CBS's series ''Survivor,'' we can expect the other networks to play catch-up with copycat versions like these:</p>
        <p>Big Apple Survivor (Fox)</p>
        <p>Two eight-member teams of Midwestern tourists are dropped off in Bensonhurst with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Over the next 39 days, relying on their wits, they compete to see which player will be first to reach Midtown and claim the million-dollar prize. Every three nights, the teams are pitted in competitions like ticket scalping and taxicab hailing in hopes of winning precious prizes like subway tokens. The losing team must vote to remove a member, who is left in the new Times Square to wander alone.</p>

The losing team must vote to remove a member, who is left in the new Times Square to wander alone.</p>
        <p>Silicon Valley Survivor (ABC)</p>
        <p>Ten technophobes, deposited in Silicon Valley, use their rudimentary skills to see who will be first to contact family and be taken home. Watch as they tackle coinless pay phones, cashless supermarkets and Palm Pilot banking. Each week, the survivors are given a new device, like an e-mail pager or Global Positioning System receiver, with just an instruction manual to guide them.</p>
        <p>White House Survivor (NBC)</p>
        <p>Fifteen males and one female are split into teams, the Democrats and the Republicans. Using only their natural gifts to raise soft money, each team slowly narrows itself down to one presidential candidate. The two finalists compete in a late fall 900-number telephone contest for a four-year term.</p>
        <p>E.U. Survivor (CNN)</p>
        <p>Each week, representatives of the 15 countries of the European Union compete to see which will emerge as the economic ruler of Europe. Contestants can artificially inflate or deflate their currencies to undermine the euro. Smaller countries can band together to reinstate tariff barriers. The show will end when Germany wins.</p>
        <p>Solar System Survivor (PBS)</p>
        <p>Nine planets, nine orbits. Watch as each of the planets tries to avoid the effects of climatic change, deteriorating orbits and random asteroids. See who survives into the next millennium and who ends up as a sunspot.</p>
