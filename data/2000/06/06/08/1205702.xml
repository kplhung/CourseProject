        <p>IT'S not that Martin Jacobson is a patient man. He is not. But Mr. Jacobson, the soccer coach at Martin Luther King High School, is a realist: ''Come on. This is New York. You put up with it.''</p>
        <p>What he and his team tolerate is hard to believe, even in New York. Changing clothes on the subway because of inadequate locker rooms in the school on Manhattan's West Side. Spending 90 minutes taking two trains and a bus to a playing field on Randalls Island. Lugging 40 pounds of nets to practice. Raising money to buy uniforms.</p>
        <p>All of this when New York City has a budget surplus and is committing generous capital dollars to building two minor-league baseball stadiums: for the Yankees in the St. George section of Staten Island and for the Mets in Coney Island.</p>
        <p>''Let them have their stadiums, that's  O.K.,'' Mr. Jacobson said. ''But they are neglecting teenagers in high school. We need more cooperation.'' And more money.</p>
        <p>It's not school athletic facilities vs. professional sports stadiums. There can be both. There are both. But look at the relative numbers:</p>
        <p>For public school ball fields, in the new city operating budget: $10 million.</p>
        <p>For minor-league stadiums, in the new city capital budget: $142 million. That's $71 million for the Yankees complex on Staten Island (which includes local improvements like a new esplanade); $61 million for the Mets ballpark, including $30 million to spruce up the boardwalk area; and $10 million for temporary ballparks. Plus plans down the road to contribute $30 million to an amateur sports complex for southern Brooklyn, subject to future budget votes.</p>
        <p>All this spending, while Mr. Jacobson and his team -- ranked among the top five in the country -- have to finagle just to get playing time at Randalls Island or at Riverbank State Park. And they are hardly the only ones with such problems.</p>
        <p>Only a third of the city's high schools have their own playing fields, and many are in bad shape. Finding playing space anywhere is a challenge. Not only are athletic fields in this vertical city scarce, but public schools have to compete with private schools and adult teams that can pay higher users' fees.</p>
        <p>The Board of Education has a new physical fitness initiative, but the city is still spending almost a third less on sports equipment and supplies than it did on the eve of its fiscal crisis in 1974.</p>
        <p>This has to make one wonder about priorities. Especially since none of this is new. The problems were documented in a series of New York Times articles last year, portrayed on ''60 Minutes,'' and cited just last week by Mark Green, the public advocate.</p>
        <p>The bad publicity did get attention. A new private group, Take the Field, was begun in February and is raising money; it is already adding about $3 million to the city's $10 million for athletic fields -- enough to build at least one major track and field facility in each borough.</p>
        <p>BUT school officials estimate that they need $300 million to upgrade fields and playgrounds, not to mention pools and gyms.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to justify spending over $100 million on minor-league stadiums when not even 40 percent of our high schools have outdoor playing fields,'' Mr. Green said, adding that the Staten Island project ''seems more like patronage than investment,'' because the borough has been such a stronghold for Mr. Giuliani, until recently a Senate candidate in pursuit of votes.</p>
        <p>The mayor says that economic development, not politics, was his motive, and contends that the stadiums will act as catalysts. Michael G. Carey, president of his Economic Development Corporation, expressed confidence yesterday that ''improving barren areas will bring private investments.''</p>
        <p>But many an economist disputes that theory. Building a stadium ''doesn't create development, doesn't generate jobs, raise per capita income -- it does just about nothing,'' said Andrew S. Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who consults with governments about sports facilities. ''Just take a drive up to Yankee Stadium and see all the activity it's spawned. There isn't any.''</p>
        <p>But City Hall is betting that investing in St. George and Coney Island will be different. And the City Council did what legislatures generally do when voting on spending money in their own communities: approve.</p>
        <p>So the Yankees and the Mets will have their farm teams, if litigation does not get in the way. And Mr. Jacobson and his players will continue to scramble. ''Nothing's changed,'' he said. ''I've learned to accept deplorable conditions. Hey. This is New York.''</p>
