        <p>Late Tuesday night, when she finally heard she had squeaked by her opponent in a hard-fought Republican primary, Representative Marge S. Roukema quoted her friend, the writer Mary Higgins Clark, who stood next to her on the podium as the congresswoman addressed her supporters.</p>
        <p>''As Mary Higgins Clark, the famous writer, told me, 'A win is a win is a win,' '' said Mrs. Roukema, who  defeated State Assemblyman E. Scott Garrett by about 1,500 votes. ''Fifty-two percentage points -- we'll take it.''</p>
        <p>True enough, after hours of nail-biting, when at several points it had appeared that Mr. Garrett, who was challenging her for the second time in a row, might pull it off, there was only one winner, and that was Mrs. Roukema. She won in spite of the large amount of financial support Mr. Garrett received from the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative Washington group that has vowed to oust more moderate Republicans.</p>
        <p>Most political experts now expect Mrs. Roukema to handily win re-election in November, in a district that has proven to be a Republican stronghold in every election. Her Democratic opponent is Linda Mercurio, an adjunct professor at Seton Hall Law School who ran unsuccessfully for the Assembly last year as an independent.</p>
        <p>But it is within her own party that Mrs. Roukema has been shown vulnerable. Her challenger ran slightly stronger on Tuesday than the last primary, when he lost by 1,717 votes.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Roukema was the only New Jersey Congressional incumbent facing a primary challenge on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''You have to ask yourself, why has she been challenged?'' said Stephen Salmore, a political consultant who has worked for the Republicans.</p>
        <p>One reason is her district: the fifth, a two-headed creature that covers four counties, from moderate and more densely populated Bergen County in the east to the more rural and conservative Sussex, Warren and Passaic Counties to the west. Mr. Garrett won this time in the three western counties, and lost only in Bergen County.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garrett tried to portray Mrs. Roukema, a 20-year member of Congress who has served longer than any woman now in the House, as too moderate for the Fifth District. He and Mrs. Roukema have almost opposite positions on issues like abortion, school vouchers and Social Security investments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garrett did not return calls for comment on primary night and yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Roukema said the race was close mostly because of the amount of money Mr. Garrett had amassed from donors outside the state.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what it says, except that this time it's a very serious negative omen for our party,'' she said yesterday from Washington. ''It's the fact that we have this outside group with extreme views coming into my district and trying to tell people how to vote.''</p>
        <p>Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, said his group provided about $250,000 to Mr. Garrett's campaign, in direct contributions and mailings and other advertisements. Mrs. Roukema said she spent about $400,000 on the primary, ''a little more than last time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore said, ''We're obviously discouraged that we lost, but we do feel like we sort of sent a message.''</p>
        <p>He said that in the past, ''Marge has had a very liberal voting record.'' Since his group got involved in the race, he said, she has softened some of her positions.</p>
        <p>Others said that Mrs. Roukema's win was narrow because some voters clearly thought someone else could do a better job.</p>
        <p>''You can't say it's just because socially conservative Republicans are strong in the district,'' said Mr. Salmore, the political consultant. ''It's also because she wasn't as effective as other incumbents. She hasn't been able to establish herself over the years as much as others.''</p>
        <p>Two other Congressional races in the state were being closely watched by party leaders.</p>
        <p>Four Republicans and four Democrats competed to win their party nominations for the Seventh District, left vacant by Robert D. Franks.</p>
        <p>On the Republican side, Mike Ferguson, a Warren Township educator, beat Thomas H. Kean Jr., the former governor's son. On the Democratic side, the Union County manager, Michael J. Lapolla, said he would seek a recount of an unofficial tally that showed Maryanne Connelly, a former mayor of Fanwood, winning the nomination with 14,224 votes, only 194 more than Mr. LaPolla.</p>
        <p>In the 12th District, former Representative Dick Zimmer easily defeated former Representative Mike Pappas, and will now face a Democratic incumbent, Rush Holt, in November.  PRIMARY IN NEW JERSEY: THE HOUSE</p>
