        <p>As an antiques dealer, Florence Lopez (above) is known among Paris's design sophisticates for her daring but beautiful pieces. But buying from this petite blond whirlwind comes at a steep price -- a five-floor walk up to her apartment-cum-showroom overlooking the rooftops of St.-Germain-des-Pres. Treasures include rare furniture by Adolf Loos and Jean Prouve, strange 19th-century photographs, an oversize sofa or table from a chateau sale, and the convex ''witch's mirror'' (below) in a purple velour frame. Things too large to carry are hoisted out the window. By appointment: 011-33-1-40-49-08-12.</p>
