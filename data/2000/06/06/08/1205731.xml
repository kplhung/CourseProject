        <p>Late last summer, when Juddmonte Farms' manager, Garrett O'Rourke, delivered the breeding operation's 2-year-olds to the trainer Bobby Frankel, he told Frankel that the dark brown son of A. P. Indy was his Kentucky Derby horse. The Brooklyn-born Frankel, a headstrong sort, was not so sure.</p>
        <p>The colt named Aptitude worked all right in the morning, but Frankel recognized that he did not possess the quick turn of foot to be a sprinter. So he chose a mile race on the turf for his debut last October. The colt finished a decent sixth. In November, he kept Aptitude on the grass for a late-closing second. Better, but hardly a ticket to Churchill Downs for the first Saturday in May.</p>

        <p>Late last summer, when Juddmonte Farms' manager, Garrett O'Rourke, delivered the breeding operation's 2-year-olds to the trainer Bobby Frankel, he told Frankel that the dark brown son of A. P. Indy was his Kentucky Derby horse. The Brooklyn-born Frankel, a headstrong sort, was not so sure.</p>
        <p>The colt named Aptitude worked all right in the morning, but Frankel recognized that he did not possess the quick turn of foot to be a sprinter. So he chose a mile race on the turf for his debut last October. The colt finished a decent sixth. In November, he kept Aptitude on the grass for a late-closing second. Better, but hardly a ticket to Churchill Downs for the first Saturday in May.</p>
        <p>On New Year's Day at Santa Anita in a mile-and-a-sixteenth race on the dirt, however, Frankel discovered what O'Rourke had been so certain of: that Aptitude was better going longer. He won that day and earned two trips east to Aqueduct for the Gotham and the Wood in preparation for the Kentucky Derby.</p>
        <p>''He was right,'' Frankel said of O'Rourke's prediction. ''It's nice to be right. You ever been to the racetrack and heard somebody yelling, 'I told you that horse would win?' It's not even about the money. They just want to be right.''</p>
        <p>Frankel, 58, knows plenty about the racetrack and enough about being right. In the Derby, Aptitude closed strongly to finish second by a length and a half to Fusaichi Pegasus. Even before that race, Frankel made it known that the horse he once doubted was going to be formidable in the mile-and-a-half Belmont, the race A. P. Indy won in 1992.</p>
        <p>So he skipped the Preakness. Now Frankel and Aptitude are trying to do what no other horse has done in the 132-year history of the Belmont: win the third leg of the Triple Crown without a race of any kind between the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont.</p>
        <p>The Belmont oddsmaker has made Aptitude the 8-5 morning-line favorite.</p>
        <p>''He's a natural mile-and-a-half horse,'' Frankel said. ''It's not something you can train into a horse. It's in a horse's pedigree and the way he runs.''</p>
        <p>Frankel often acts like the guy in the OTB parlor who wants to be right. He is emotional, combative and a straight talker. Last fall, in colorful and provocative language, he harangued California racing officials for not permitting nasal strips. The officials eventually changed their minds. Earlier this spring, he lambasted the jockey Corey Nakatani for reneging on a riding commitment and said Nakatani would never ride for him again.</p>
        <p>After a two-month ban, however, Nakatani is back on some of Frankel's horses. And moments after the Derby, when the racing world was just beginning to canonize Fusaichi Pegasus as a superhorse, a forlorn Frankel said his horse should have won. His jockey, Alex Solis, moved off the rail too soon and ceded the ground-saving inside trip to Kent Desormeaux and Fusaichi Pegasus, he reasoned.</p>
        <p>''I said he could have won,'' Frankel said yesterday. ''It would have at least been a photo.''</p>
        <p>Frankel came by these competitive traits honestly while growing up in Brooklyn and Far Rockaway. He played many sports and was introduced to the racetrack by his parents, who were dedicated horse racing enthusiasts. They took him by ferry to Monmouth Park on the Jersey Shore and drove him down Interstate 95 to Baltimore for races at Pimlico.</p>
        <p>Frankel did not cross over from the front to the backside of the track until he was in his 20's, when a friend told him about a job walking horses in the morning. He was hooked. After an apprenticeship with established trainers, Frankel went out on his own with a small stable of mostly claimers and tied for the training title at Saratoga in 1970.</p>
        <p>But it was not until Frankel went to California in 1972 that people started taking notice of his healthy winning percentages; that year he posted 60 victories at Hollywood Park, a record that still stands.</p>
        <p>He has since won 25 training titles at Hollywood Park, Santa Anita and Del Mar, and he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1995. Last year, Frankel's horses earned $7 million, enough to finish fourth in the purse earnings in the nation. Still, he has yet to win a Triple Crown or a Breeders' Cup race. Frankel is unfazed about that, as well. His stable has always been geared to older horses, especially those who excel on the grass.</p>
        <p>He will not push them, he says, because he values longevity over flashy victory photos.</p>
        <p>Frankel quotes a colleague, Bruce Headley, by way of summing up how he handles his horses and himself: ''It's not who's best. It's who lasts.''</p>
        <p>He is sure that he is right that Aptitude will be both on Saturday.</p>
