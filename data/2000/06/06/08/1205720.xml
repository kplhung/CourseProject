        <p>Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's order to split Microsoft into two independent companies -- one selling Windows, the other selling applications like Word and Excel -- is the proper remedy for repeated violations of the antitrust laws. A less drastic remedy would prove ineffectual or horribly intrusive. Judge Jackson chose breakup because the two companies would then compete and innovate without having government officials overseeing every move. Breakup is the best way to create a market where Microsoft can no longer smother software that would be good for consumers but bad for Microsoft.</p>
        <p>After two years of deliberation, Judge Jackson ruled in April that Microsoft had abused its monopoly over Windows, the operating system that runs nearly all personal computers, to crush competition. It adopted business practices that would have been unprofitable but for their role in blocking rivals from getting fair access to customers. Specifically, for example, it used illegal tactics to prevent Netscape from freely selling its browser.</p>
        <p>That is important because the Netscape browser could have served as the platform from which customers could run word processors and other application programs, thereby diminishing the importance of the Windows operating system. Using a monopoly to block entry into a market by potential competitors is a blatant violation of the antitrust laws.</p>
        <p>The judge could have turned to a less drastic remedy, imposing rules that would prohibit Microsoft from engaging in illegal practices. Indeed, the judge did impose such rules for the next several years. But relying on rules permanently would be unworkable. In a fast-moving industry, rules become irrelevant quickly. Besides, an army of government officials would be needed to second-guess every contract that Microsoft would enter into and every product design it would offer to its customers. Judge Jackson decided instead to create two companies, each having incentive to do business with independent software enterprises and even encroach on the other's territory. The Windows company might, for example, develop applications and the applications company might develop a substitute for Windows. That should give consumers the benefit of vigorous innovation.</p>
        <p>The government, with the judge's blessing, will try to take Microsoft's appeal directly to the Supreme Court as the law allows for important antitrust cases. That would bypass the normal practice of having an appeals court first analyze the complicated technological and legal issues raised by this case so as to provide a fuller record before the Supreme Court is asked to render a final judgment.</p>
        <p>But this is a case where an expedited appeal to the Supreme Court, explicitly allowed under a 1974 revision to the antitrust laws, is justified. The uncertainty over Microsoft's future is sure to complicate business judgments in the fast-changing world of high-tech industry, the company's monopolistic practices have been egregious, and the nation deserves a speedy resolution of this struggle by the highest court in the land. There is no need to drag it out with an intervening appellate review.</p>
        <p>Though the content of Judge Jackson's ruling was unsurprising, the tone was startlingly stern. Microsoft, he says, has been ''not credible,'' ''untrustworthy,'' ''disingenuous.'' And he added, ''There is credible evidence in the record to suggest that Microsoft, convinced of its innocence, continues to do business as it has in the past and may yet do to other markets what it has already done.'' Judge Jackson sided completely with the government in part because he mistrusts the company. Yesterday Microsoft reaped the well-deserved consequences.</p>
