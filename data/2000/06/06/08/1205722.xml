        <p>Editorial on need for campaign finance reform cites $35 million spent by Jon Corzine to win Democratic Senate primary in New Jersey; urges Corzine and Republican rival, Rep Bob Franks, to work to reform campaign financing and accept offers to debate</p>

        <p>At his victory celebration after Tuesday's election, Jon Corzine, New Jersey's new Democratic Senate nominee, made a promise that could be taken two ways.

        <p>At his victory celebration after Tuesday's election, Jon Corzine, New Jersey's new Democratic Senate nominee, made a promise that could be taken two ways. ''I want to invest in America,'' he told supporters. ''That's what this campaign is all about.'' What the former Wall Street financier meant was that he wanted to spend for better health care and schools, instead of cutting taxes. But Mr. Corzine had also just invested a stratospheric $35 million to win a primary, more than any other Senate candidate in American history. The price tag for this victory now stands as a distressing symbol of a political system so driven by money that a candidate must be either extremely wealthy or extremely beholden to contributors in order to win. Mr. Corzine and Representative Bob Franks, his Republican competitor for the general election, should now commit themselves to correcting the way money skews the nation's politics.</p>
        <p>Both these candidates talk about favoring campaign finance reform, but Mr. Corzine has a special obligation to push for remedies to the very imbalance that helped him win. Campaigns for federal office need a combination of public financing and free television time.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey spectacle also offers only the latest important signal to the Supreme Court of how its unfortunate 1976 decision treating political money as free speech has given an unfair advantage to wealthy candidates. When Congress finally begins dealing with this issue as part of a desperately needed campaign finance reform package, it should enact a mandatory limit on the use of personal wealth in campaigns as a way of forcing the court to correct its earlier decision.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, is not the first wealthy novice to try his hand at politics. A fellow New Jersey resident, Steve Forbes, unloaded $70 million in two unsuccessful tries for the presidency. Ron Lauder, Al Checchi and Michael Huffington tried to buy victory, but lost. Mr. Corzine's success at this stage appears to have resulted not simply from $1 million a week spent on television ads, but also from his heavy spending on voter turnout and his lavish contributions to the state's Democratic Party organizations. It was this generosity that party regulars more than reciprocated when they trotted out the loyal vote on this rain-soaked Election Day.</p>
        <p>What also fueled Mr. Corzine's victory was a deep anger at his worthy but unpopular opponent, former Gov. Jim Florio, who raised taxes in 1990 to help schools in poorer areas. For the general election, Mr. Corzine's opposition will not be so instantly unloved. Congressman Franks has almost no sharp edges as a timid but moderate Republican. Mr. Corzine ought to be able to gain traction from Mr. Franks's tendency to slip away from hard votes or even from giving his views as a candidate on how he would have voted on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. But Mr. Corzine also hid from the most important candidate debate in the primary.</p>
        <p>Both candidates should now readily accept offers to debate, especially in the larger forums offered by such groups as the League of Women Voters. New Jersey's residents deserve to see these two candidates not in their soft and expensive television ads but in debates that are not choreographed to shield them from tough policy tests. Without such promises to debate linked to a solid oath to reform campaign financing, the New Jersey race could degenerate into an auction. But neither a Democrat's deep pockets nor Republican campaign committees' habitual dependence on special-interest money should determine the outcome of a race for the United States Senate.</p>
