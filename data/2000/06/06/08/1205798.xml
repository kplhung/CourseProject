        <p>On Saturday afternoon, a single 17-year-old mother and her 16-month-old son, Anthony, enjoyed a family outing. She and other young relatives  and their five children went to a street carnival to celebrate a family birthday, a cousin, Wanda Cruz, said today.</p>
        <p>On Saturday night, the authorities said, the young mother, apparently distraught at her failure to find a baby sitter, threw her son into the Passaic River from a footbridge here and then went to visit a new boyfriend.</p>
        <p>After a three-day search of the river's murky, swift waters, rescue teams today found the body of a baby boy that had been caught in some debris in the rain-swollen river about three miles downstream from the bridge.</p>
        <p>The body was clothed in a diaper and a red and blue sweatsuit, clothing similar to what Anthony was said to be wearing on Saturday night, according to Boris Moczula, the first assistant Passaic County prosecutor. Although the body had not been positively identified, Mr. Moczula said detectives believed it was that of the missing boy.</p>
        <p>Today, Ms. Cruz and former co-workers of the young woman, who was not named because of her age,  said they were dumbfounded by both the baby's disappearance and the police explanation. The police charged the mother with murder on Monday.</p>
        <p>The friends described the woman  as a hard-working person who enjoyed her baby. She was studying to become a nurse's aide and planning to establish her own home, they said.</p>
        <p>''She was always fine with the baby, she was a great mother,'' said Ms. Cruz, 22, who, with her two children, lived with the woman last fall in a two-story white house in the northwest corner of Paterson.</p>
        <p>Officials said she dropped out of Kennedy High School here in November 1998, two months before Anthony was born, but enrolled in the school's adult evening classes last fall to obtain a high school equivalency diploma.</p>
        <p>The young woman and the baby's father never married, but they continued to date for several months after the baby's birth in January 1999.</p>
        <p>Both the mother's relatives and the father's helped her by buying a crib, stroller and clothing for the baby, Ms. Cruz said.</p>
        <p>Until about two months ago, the young woman worked as a sales clerk in the men's department at the Stern's department store in the Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, former co-workers said today. She left to take a higher-paying office job, they said.</p>
        <p>Jualesca Colon, a store clerk, said the young woman often took her  baby to the store on her days off to show him to co-workers. ''He was a real cute baby,'' quick to smile when adults played with him, Ms. Colon said. Sometimes the boy's father accompanied the young woman on her visits, she said.</p>
        <p>''She was so happy with her baby, and she wanted to prove to people who doubted her that she could go on with her life,'' said another former co-worker, who asked to remain anonymous.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cruz said her cousin was in good spirits at the carnival on Saturday, enjoying the rides with her son. Once, the baby cried when he went on a children's train ride, she said. But, she added, the boy calmed down when they bought him a hot dog. Hours later, Ms. Cruz said, her cousin asked her to baby-sit for Anthony that night. Ms. Cruz said she declined because she was watching her own two children.</p>
        <p>She said, '' 'O.K., I'll leave him with his father,' '' Ms. Cruz said, and left their home in a good mood.</p>
        <p>William Purdy, the chief assistant Passaic County prosecutor, said today that detectives found no evidence that the young woman had neglected or abused the baby previously. ''There apparently was a history of her being frustrated with being tied down with the child,'' Mr. Purdy said. He declined to discuss details.</p>
        <p>He said the baby had stayed with his father, who is 19, on Friday night, and the mother picked him up Saturday afternoon. About 11 o'clock Saturday night, Mr. Purdy said, she wanted to visit a new boyfriend but was ''apparently unable to find a baby sitter.''</p>
        <p>''She went to the footbridge and threw the baby into the river,'' Mr. Purdy said.</p>
        <p>She visited with the boyfriend, 19,  and later went home, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Purdy declined to discuss what the woman did on on Sunday.  But about 3 a.m. Monday, he said, she went to St. Joseph's Hospital here, seeking psychiatric care.</p>
        <p>Shortly afterward, he said, hospital officials called Paterson police to report that a baby had been thrown into the river.</p>
        <p>The young woman was arrested on murder charges several hours later.  Neither the baby's father nor the young woman's boyfriend are considered suspects, Mr. Purdy said.</p>
