        <p>LONG before television became a friendly flicker in American households and laptop computers started popping up in trendy coffee bars, there were comic books. Crammed with colorful graphics and plain-talking superheroes speaking in bursts of text, comic books looked like Web sites in search of a Web.</p>
        <p>Now executives and artists at Marvel Comics are turning to digital technology to give birth to an entirely new kind of comic book to be started on the Internet this summer:  a free online version.</p>
        <p>Bill Jemas, president of publishing, new media and consumer products at Marvel, calls the new approach SpiderCam because it stars Marvel's most popular character, Spider-Man, and is produced with cameras.</p>
        <p>Everything except Spider-Man himself is being shot in New York with high-resolution digital cameras using models, actors and landmark locations that even the occasional tourist would easily recognize.</p>
        <p>Little, if anything, will be drawn by hand. Details and visual effects, like the suggestion of motion, are more likely to be accomplished with computers using Photoshop software, say artists working on the SpiderCam episodes.</p>
        <p>''We're getting as much as we can in camera,'' said Henry Tenney, director of the first SpiderCam episode, called ''Pretty Ugly.'' He said artists using Photoshop would give the comic a consistent look.</p>
        <p>Spider-Man, the arachnid-powered superhero, will also be computer-generated and inserted into the photo-realistic action scenes.</p>
        <p>Why? ''Because no human can do what your imagination wants Spider-Man to be,'' Mr. Jemas said. When these still scenes download and appear on computer screens, he said, they will -- using Flash technology -- splash, slide and glide into view, quickly assembling in varying shapes for dramatic effect into something resembling a traditional comic book page.</p>
        <p>''Our readers want to see the cutting edge,'' he said.</p>
        <p>By early next year, Mr. Jemas said, the scenes will be accompanied by voice-over narration in a style much like a recorded book. When the first SpiderCams appear online at www.Marvel.com the only sounds will be sound effects, he said.</p>
        <p>There have been other comic books online, often referred to as cybercomics, to recapture young, male readers who may have migrated to electronic entertainments like video games, many of which feature comic book characters or their computer-animated knock-offs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jemas said he hoped that the new form would induce writers and artists to invest their talents in the medium.</p>
        <p>''Our mission here is to invite the best and the brightest from other media to come into the comic book world,'' he said. Mr. Jemas said he would like to say to screenwriters unable to get their projects on movie screens, ''Here's a budget and go shoot your stuff.''</p>
        <p>But producing a photo comic book is not as simple as it may sound, said Philip Goetz, vice president of new media programming for Marvel.</p>
        <p>Like an action film, each SpiderCam script is worked out on a storyboard with scene-by-scene sketches. Actors and models are cast and put in costumes. Location shooting, usually with a crew of no more than a few people, takes about 10 days, Mr. Goetz said.</p>
        <p>Everything is shot with two Sony high-resolution digital still cameras, one automatic and the other manually operated. Hundreds of pictures are taken, he said, but only about 150 will make it to the finished episode.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest difficulties, Mr. Goetz said, is shooting still scenes that give the reader a sense of action. In a traditional comic book, action is often suggested by drawing characters frozen in motion or placing the reader at distorting vantage points, like beneath a falling bad guy or in the direct path of a spray of gunfire.</p>
        <p>When similar techniques are used with flesh and blood models and actors, the effect can be stilted, Mr. Goetz and Mr. Tenney said.</p>
        <p>''When you shoot the actors in motion with a still camera you get a lot of half-closed eyes and blurred limbs,'' Mr. Tenney said. ''What we do is try to set them up and make it as kinetic as possible.''</p>
        <p>The last thing he wants to see, Mr. Tenney said, is ''a lot of people standing around.''</p>
