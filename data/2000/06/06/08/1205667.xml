        <p>When this newspaper last looked in on Viktor Kuzmin, an eon ago in 1990, Russia was still in the Soviet Union. And Mr. Kuzmin, 45, a brash, elfin rebel, was kicking hard at its tottering legs.</p>
        <p>An unrepentant capitalist in a Communist state, Mr. Kuzmin seemed destined for greatness, or maybe prison. He was building his own 10,000-square-foot home, a shocking act for someone not even a Communist Party member. He had subverted state curbs on ownership by declaring himself a business. He ran his own construction company and planned to start an investment bank.</p>
        <p>He also had gotten himself certified by a doctor as sane, thwarting local apparatchiks who had summoned him for a psychiatric examination -- a first step toward the mental hospitals then used to silence troublemakers.</p>
        <p>''The old authorities consider me dangerous,'' he boasted in an interview with The New York Times. ''And of course, they are right. Anyone independent is a threat to them.''</p>
        <p>Such nose-thumbing at Communism's arthritic creed was news enough back then. Today it seems almost quaint. It is no longer news that capitalism triumphed in Russia.</p>
        <p>It would nevertheless have been nice to report that Capitalist Kuzmin triumphed with it. But when the newspaper caught up with him recently, intent on chewing nearly a decade of post-Soviet fat, his first words made clear that the facts were otherwise.</p>
        <p>''We were just laughing today,'' he said, not laughing at all. ''All of us have two higher education degrees, degrees from two institutions. But our country is such that we have to dig to make a living.''</p>
        <p>In a still unfinished dirt-floor room in his still mostly roofless house, Mr. Kuzmin stood with two sweaty colleagues. There was no tie on his frayed-at-the-collar shirt. Instead of a cellular phone, he was grasping a shovel. He was digging holes in the floor for his latest and considerably less grandiose business venture, a one-saw sawmill.</p>
        <p>There is surely no shame in that. But even he allows that a shovel is a far cry from what was wrested from his grasp just a few years ago.</p>
        <p>A quick diversion: Viktor Kuzmin is not your ordinary Ivan. He has two pony-sized guard dogs, a fence plastered with warning signs, a sawed-off shotgun under his desk and, for some reason, a dump truck and a brand-new Volvo station wagon.</p>
        <p>The Kuzmin manse, on a glorious, sweeping bend of the Vologda River, is equally eccentric. His first unfinished house, which he began in 1987, stands next to the foundation of a second unfinished house, under construction because House No. 1 was turned over to the sawmill, an auto-repair shop and other speculative ventures.</p>
        <p>A short walk away, on a plot with the best river view, stands House No. 3, a tiny wooden bungalow that serves as home until Houses No. 1 and 2 are, one hopes, finished.</p>
        <p>The place is a metaphor for Mr. Kuzmin, a man so tossed by brainstorms that the latest great scheme is as likely as not to be tossed by the roadside to accommodate the next. People think he is strange, said an official of Vologda's regional government. They are right.</p>
        <p>But he is neither crazy nor stupid. At 55 he is an accomplished architect, an engineer, a self-taught lawyer and, albeit a bit loquacious, an eloquent advocate for the new Russia.</p>
        <p>Anyway, you might be a bit strange too, if your story were like his.</p>
        <p>In December 1990, Mr. Kuzmin had quit a state construction company in disgust after refusing a demand that he join the Communist Party. It was a good move: soon, his own building firm had a payroll of 30 people. And by bartering his talents, he had acquired the loveliest eight acres of a riverside collective farm, where he dug a pond and began erecting his mansion. There would be arched windows, he said, and a gymnasium, two greenhouses, workshops and a sheep-breeding pen.</p>
        <p>For a man despised by the authorities, life was pretty good. And when Communism collapsed a year later, it seemed fated to get better. Mr. Kuzmin had his defenders, mostly progressive city officials who saw opportunity in democracy and the free market.</p>
        <p>When an ambitious plan emerged to restore 85 acres of riverfront construction in this pleasant if slightly homely city of 300,000, near the site of its founding in 1417, they asked him to execute it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuzmin immersed himself. He spent a year in Moscow researching architecture and history. He drafted a plan adorning the city's squares with new and restored buildings and a rebuilt historic cathedral. He worked out financing with a Soviet-American venture and courted European bankers. He started a company to promote travel across Russia's northwest, recruited foreign agencies to promote it and built cabins for Vologda sightseers.</p>
        <p>The whole project took on the aroma of serious money. Which in Russia, in the early 1990's, was a serious mistake.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuzmin says his fairy tale lost its gossamer wings in 1992, when local officials demanded that he build them five cottages in exchange for their political support. He told them where to get off.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Where's the money?' '' he recalled. ''And they said to take it where you can; they didn't care. But I never compromised my conscience. I'm stubborn.''</p>
        <p>Retribution was swift. Official support for the project began to evaporate. When Mr. Kuzmin discovered that a deputy had taken project money to build himself a home, he angrily razed its foundation -- and got arrested. The deputy went scot-free. Mr. Kuzmin was fined $30,000 and given a three-year suspended prison sentence.</p>
        <p>Mikhail Korachev, then and now the region's director of historic preservation, testified in Mr. Kuzmin's defense. Soon his home was firebombed. So was Mr. Kuzmin's downtown office, where he was directing the restoration, his travel program and a yet another venture to sell tourists Russian handicrafts.</p>
        <p>In 1996 the city seized his 85-acre development site, saying the project had failed to materialize. Without the restoration project, his tourism venture collapsed. His handicrafts business had been firebombed. His payroll shrank from 30 to 2.</p>
        <p>Over time, several corrupt officials in the restoration project went to jail. The region's governor and a deputy were investigated, though never prosecuted. It is all cold comfort to Mr. Kuzmin, who has moved from international banking and real estate to turning out finished planks for other builders.</p>
        <p>He still hoards his plans and architectural drawings, magnificent panels depicting riverfront architecture done up in a canary yellow peculiar to Russian buildings, propped for a visitor this week against the stray cables and broken bricks of Home No. 2.</p>
        <p>''My pride and my pain,'' he said. ''My great pain.''</p>
        <p>He says he is still a capitalist -- that he does not blame capitalism, because capitalism really never made it to Russia.</p>
        <p>''The people in office now,'' he said, ''are the same people who were in office when Communism was here. They just moved chairs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuzmin walked a few yards to a bluff overlooking the broad river. A mile away, the spires and onion domes of the Spasso-Priluki monastery, newly gilded 600 years after their creation, rose from the plain, gleaming like some breathtaking Russian Oz.</p>
        <p>''This is the only spot in Vologda like this,'' he said, and fingered the buds of a nearby scrawny bush. ''I planted these apple trees. I dug that pond.'' The whirring of the gears between his ears was almost audible.</p>
        <p>''We have to work on that pond,'' he said. ''We're going to put expensive fish there, you know. It will be a great place for fishermen.''</p>
