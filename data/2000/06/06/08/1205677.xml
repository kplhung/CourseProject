        <p>For decades the Aegean Sea has been not just a vacation spot but also a zone of military confrontation. Now Turkey is debating a step that could considerably reduce tension there.</p>
        <p>A retired admiral who is an adviser to Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has recommended that Turkey disband its 100,000-man Aegean Army. The army is deployed along the Aegean coast and confronts Greek units based on islands that lie in some cases only a few miles offshore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ecevit has not commented on the four-page ''action plan'' presented by the adviser, Adm. Guven Erkaya. The general staff said the question of dissolving the Aegean force was not on its agenda.</p>
        <p>But the fact that the plan was written by such a high-ranking figure, and that its contents were so prominently reported in the Turkish press, has opened a national debate over this question for the first time.</p>
        <p>The debate follows nearly a year of steadily improving relations between Greece and Turkey. Having now resolved many of their minor disputes, they must now decide whether to move ahead to the two big ones: Cyprus and the Aegean.</p>
        <p>With Cyprus perhaps the more complex problem, Turkish leaders are apparently reflecting on how they can make progress in the Aegean.</p>
        <p>There, Greece and Turkey are locked in a tangle of sovereignty disputes over sea lanes, air rights and barren islets. A confrontation over one islet led the two countries to the brink of war in 1996.</p>
        <p>''In the course of the European Union accession process Turkey must solve its problems with Greece by 2004,'' Admiral Erkaya wrote, referring to the membership application. ''By doing away with the Aegean Army, Turkey can take the first step and, in return, put the Aegean airspace and Aegean islands disputes on the negotiating table.''</p>
        <p>The Aegean Army was deployed in 1975 after the landing of Turkish troops on Cyprus. Its first two commanders became Turkish presidents, the second, Gen. Kenan Evren, after leading a military coup in 1980.</p>
        <p>Some want the force to remain in place. Defense Minister Sabahattin Cakmakoglu, a member of the far-right Nationalist Action Party, said it was ''too early to consider suggestions that the Aegean Army be disbanded.''</p>
        <p>For the last several months, private groups of Greeks and Turks have been meeting to discuss the problems that separate their countries. Admiral Erkaya has been in several of those meetings.</p>
        <p>''As both parties get to know each other and believe in each other's sincerity, an atmosphere of confidence is born,'' wrote Mehmet Ali Birand, a newspaper and television commentator who has also taken part.</p>
        <p>Both Greece and Turkey are members of NATO, and for years their rivalry was one of the alliance's gravest internal weaknesses. But they began to cooperate after earthquakes in both countries last year, which led to outpourings of compassion and mutual support. Relations between them are now warmer than at any time since before the 1974 landing in Cyprus.</p>
        <p>In May, for the first time in more than a generation, Turkish soldiers took part in maneuvers on Greek soil. More than 150 Turkish commandos staged a mock landing on a Greek beach, and 10 Turkish warplanes flew over Greek territory.</p>
