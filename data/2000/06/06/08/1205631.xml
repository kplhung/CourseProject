        <p>IN the most ingenious small Manhattan apartments, designers and their clients become illusionists. They make beds disappear, tables double in height and televisions spin between two rooms at once.</p>
        <p>Imagine David Copperfield channeling Billy Baldwin, the space-conscious 1950's designer: now you see the furniture, now you don't.</p>
        <p>''You missed it,'' Jordan Schaps, an editor for special projects at New York magazine, said gleefully. A visitor to his railroad flat had walked right by his invisible bed, which was hugging the ceiling. Double-width, extra-long, it is raised and lowered by pulley and counterweights to a space that is his desk by day.</p>
        <p>At night, with the panache of a 1917 Pullman-car porter, Mr. Schaps transforms his 5-by-8-foot home office into a sleeping chamber. He takes the telephone off the wall, closes his desk top, draws a curtain across the bulletin board and lets the bed platform down, with pillows and comforter neatly folded in place. He uses a cane to pull the curtain across. ''It's vaudevillian,'' he said, ''or is it Chaplinesque?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schaps, who wears bow ties by day but bicycles around the neighborhood with shirt unbuttoned at night, is decidedly the playful type. His other design tricks: a television set that pivots in place between the living room and the dining room, and a dining table whose center section is glass covered and filled with sand (dotted with mementos of his favorite beaches around the world). He also created a cabinet in the shape of the United States, whose doors open where the time zones change. ''I'm very pro-America,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schaps paid $22,000 for the 700-square-foot apartment in a West Village tenement building in 1981, a momentous day in a few ways: it was also, he said, ''the day Prince Charles married Princess Diana.'' At first, he put his bed in the front room, facing Perry Street, which is paved with cobblestones. Picturesque, yes, but vexing. The sound of mounted police trotting along the street -- clickety-clack, clickety-clack -- and trucks rolling over the uneven surface -- clunk-clunk,  clunk-clunk -- led Mr. Schaps to declare, ''Let's get rid of the bed.''</p>
        <p>And yet, he is happy with his reduced (hide-the-bed) circumstances. Although Mr. Schaps is considering buying a weekend apartment in Miami, he has no plan to trade up to a larger home in Manhattan. ''I'm in apartments all the time, producing stories,'' he said, referring to his special issues on home design and food. ''When I'm in a modern, cutting-edge apartment, I say, 'This is is how I want to live.' When I'm in a traditional apartment, I say, 'This is how I want to live.' ''</p>
        <p>So he stays put, happily. ''I'm a nester,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The television twirls, too, at Emily Oberman's 750-square-foot apartment on the Lower East Side. Ms. Oberman owns Number Seventeen, a graphic design company, with Bonnie Siegler. The company creates opening sequences for television shows, and did graphics for Andre Balasz's Mercer Hotel in Manhattan and for his Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. ''I work in TV, and I love TV, and I wish I could take my TV on a dolly wherever I went,'' said Ms. Oberman, 37.</p>
        <p>She paid $120,000 for the 750-square-foot apartment in 1990, and barely unpacked until 1996, when she asked Marco Pasanella, a Manhattan interior designer, to renovate it for under $20,000. His mandate was to figure out a way that the television could follow her, like a devoted puppy, and at the same time satisfy her admitted narcissism. (''I'm really vain,'' Ms. Oberman said.)</p>
        <p>The designer, who just published his first design book, ''Living in Style Without Losing Your Mind'' (Simon &amp; Schuster), succeeded in one grand gesture. He cut a hole in the wall between the bedroom and the living room and framed the television with a cherrywood cube mirrored on the back. Then he put the cube on a Lazy Susan. ''If I'm not watching TV,'' Ms. Oberman said, laughing, ''I can watch me!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pasanella also designed a wall system made of doors of frosted glass that camouflage the ugly barred windows. A soft muted light comes in during the day, and at night, when lighted from street lamps, ''the windows become light boxes,'' he said. Nearly every panel in the room does double duty.</p>
        <p>In the living room, a pair of wood-framed grates hide the heating system on one side, and provide storage space on the other. Between them, a wood panel lifts up and out to become a desk. A round glass coffee table, 14 inches high, becomes a 28-inch-high dining table when she stacks the large wood cubes that serve as its base and adds others that are normally used for stools. Not that Ms. Oberman needs a dining table: she takes all her meals out.</p>
        <p>Not so John Danzer, the owner of Munder-Skiles, a furniture manufacturer. Despite his one-room apartment's minuscule size (518 square feet), he is a mega-host. In the last year, he counted 346 people who came to dinner in his Upper West Side home. ''That's about a dinner a week,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He has lived in the rent-controlled apartment since 1979. (The rent has increased from $375 to $660 a month.) Dinner, for up to 12 guests at a time, is served buffet style in the kitchen, but eaten sitting down. Guests are divided among three small tables, capacious enough so that elbows don't bump. ''I hire a person to help me serve,'' he said. ''I grill vegetables like parsnips and turnips in garlic and olive oil, and I make chicken or fish or fillet of beef.''</p>
        <p>When he's not giving a dinner party, the tables disappear. At party time, the bed disappears. ''I'm addicted to morphic furniture,'' he said. And indeed, it assumes various shapes. (He reinterprets some of the pieces for Munder-Skiles.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Danzer asked Walter Chatham, a Manhattan architect, to design a Murphy-style bed to cover the nonworking fireplace by day and to open up at night, via a pulley. (The comforter and pillow are strapped tight.) When Mr. Danzer tucks himself in, the television is revealed -- in the fireplace. ''Television is more like a hearth,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The three dining tables similarly lead other lives. Two are mahogany rectangular flip-top tables, usually nestled against a wall. Open, they become squares, large enough for six people. The tops are inlaid with aluminum panels. By candlelight, Mr. Danzer said, ''the tables glow.''</p>
        <p>The tables were inspired by one made by Kaare Klint (1888-1954), a Danish architect. Mr. Danzer designed his version, called the 360 Folding Table, which he sells through his company for $3,200.</p>
        <p>The third table, which seats five comfortably, is a round oak coffee table by Rene Gabriel (1890-1950), a French designer of wallpaper and furniture. It rises from 21 to 28 1/2 inches.</p>
        <p>On a recent evening, Mr. Danzer had 12 people for dinner, including the interior designers Albert Hadley and John Saladino. Mr. Danzer opened the tables mere moments before dinner. When more chairs were needed, he leapt onto the sofa and plucked four off the wall, where they were hanging from iron spikes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Danzer owns a small house and studio on 126 acres in Old Chatham, N.Y., but spends most of his time in his tiny apartment, which is only half a block from Central Park. ''I have the borrowed landscape of the park,'' he said. ''I grew up in small spaces. I couldn't live anyplace else.''</p>
        <p>That kind of loyalty comes naturally to Will Kohane, a partner in Apple Core Hotels, which owns five hotels in Manhattan. He lives in a duplex apartment that measures a still-snug 1,000 square feet, but has two terraces overlooking Central Park. He pointed out Heckscher Field, where he pitches amateur softball games on weekends.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohane bought the condominium in 1998 and asked Henry K. Stolzman, a partner in the Manhattan architectural firm of Pasanella &amp; Klein Stolzman &amp; Berg, to make the clutter that had always surrounded him disappear.</p>
        <p>The $300,000 renovation provided an apartment that appears to be minimalist -- but is not. In the bedroom, Mr. Stolzman said, ''I wanted to provide as much storage as possible but not give up the wall.'' He designed floor-to-ceiling canvas panels that slide back to reveal built-in storage. ''The screens became a perfect backdrop for the bed,'' the architect said.</p>
        <p>In a nod to Mr. Kohane's passion for softball, the architect framed the canvas panels in stainless steel, and laced the canvas to the frame with thin strips of leather, which vaguely suggest the stitches on a ball. A panel also closes the bedroom off from the hallway.</p>
        <p>Throughout the duplex, Mr. Stolzman designed only oval or round  tables. ''If you're working in a small space,'' the architect said, ''an oval table with recessed legs is easier to walk around than a square or rectangular one.''</p>
        <p>In these stressed-for-space apartments, saving a few square inches is worth shaving off a few corners.</p>
        <p>Calling In The Magicians</p>
        <p>HERE'S where these space contortionists got help.</p>
        <p>JORDAN SCHAPS -- Henry Millman, a Manhattan cabinetmaker, designed the drop-down bed, cabinetry and a revolving custom television stand, for about $20,000. Mr. Millman: (212) 675-4750.</p>
        <p>JOHN DANZER -- Walter Chatham designed the counterweighted Murphy-style bed. The design fee was $200, and the cost of construction was $1,600. Mr. Chatham: (212) 925-2202. Aluminum-inlay table, $3,200 through Munder-Skiles: (212) 717-0150.</p>
        <p>EMILY OBERMAN -- Marco Pasanella designed the twirling television cabinet; cabinet system of bookcases, frosted glass windows and flip-top desk; and flip-top kitchen table. The cost was $16,000. Mr. Pasanella: (212) 989-5373.</p>
        <p>WILL KOHANE -- Henry K. Stolzman, of Pasanella &amp; Klein Stolzman &amp; Berg Architects, designed the round and oval glass tables, which cost $4,600 to $4,800, made by Roberto Gil of Casa Collections: (718) 694-0272. The Maxalto oval wood table by Antonio Citterio sells for $1,675 at B&amp;B Italia, (212) 758-4046. The cotton canvas screens are $25,000  for 240 square feet. Mr. Stolzman: (212) 594-2010.</p>
