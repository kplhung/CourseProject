        <p>If copyright laws are not more broadly and aggressively enforced on the Internet, software developers will be forced to resort to cumbersome technological protections that consumers will not like, an industry leader warned today.</p>

        <p>If copyright laws are not more broadly and aggressively enforced on the Internet, software developers will be forced to resort to cumbersome technological protections that consumers will not like, an industry leader warned today.</p>
        <p>''You're going to have a piece of music that will only play on one Walkman,'' said John E. Warnock, the chairman and chief executive of Adobe Systems, during a panel discussion on Capitol Hill involving 10 key software executives. ''You're going to have a piece of software that will only work on one machine. It will provide enormous inconvenience.''</p>
        <p>The industry officials were in Washington as part of an annual lobbying trip organized by the Business Software Alliance. They said they were not asking for new copyright laws, just better prosecution of the fast-growing number of digital piracy cases.</p>
        <p>''We need more cases brought to the court system,'' said Carol Bartz, chairman and chief executive of Autodesk Inc.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warnock also urged the government to educate young people who think piracy and computer intrusions are no big deal.</p>
        <p>''We would like government to set an example, to send a message that this is breaking the law and the law will be enforced,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In a survey released by the alliance in conjunction with the visit, software executives estimated that by 2005, 66 percent of software will be distributed over the Internet, compared with 12 percent today.</p>
        <p>''The increase in Internet distribution and the growing number of users raises the possibility of even greater losses due to piracy in the coming years,'' said the study, which cited an estimate that 36 percent of software in use last year had been pirated.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bartz said she would urge that Congress become involved in encouraging more copyright enforcement efforts by federal authorities.</p>
        <p>In addition to meeting with administration officials and Congressional leaders over the last two days, the executives sent letters to the presidential candidates asking for their dedication to three top policy goals outlined in the survey.</p>
        <p>In addition to broader copyright enforcement, they are urging continued adoption of free trade policies. The House recently voted to establish free trade with China and a vote is pending in the Senate.</p>
        <p>The executives are also pushing for more visas for skilled foreign workers, saying that without the visas, 9 percent of America's high-skill, high-wage jobs will go unfilled.</p>
        <p>''How you respond to these issues will have a vital impact on the next phase of the Internet economy, with tremendous consequences for American jobs, standard of living and competitiveness,'' the executives wrote. ''We ask for your full support and your commitment to make these an integral part of your policy agenda.''</p>
        <p>Among the other software executives in Washington on Wednesday were Andrew S. Grove of Intel, Eric E. Schmidt of Novell and Stephen M. Bennett of Intuit. William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, was in Washington on Tuesday for meetings and a Congressional hearing, but returned to Seattle on Tuesday night.</p>
