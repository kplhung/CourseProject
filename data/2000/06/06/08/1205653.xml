        <p>In an extensive report that infuriated NATO leaders, Amnesty International said today that NATO violated international law in its bombing war over Yugoslavia by hitting targets where civilians were sure to be killed.</p>
        <p>In particular, the human rights group said that NATO's bombing of the Belgrade headquarters of Radio Television Serbia, on April 23, 1999, ''was a deliberate attack on a civilian object and as such constitutes a war crime.'' Sixteen people died in the predawn attack, nearly all of them technicians, security workers  and makeup artists.</p>

        <p>In an extensive report that infuriated NATO leaders, Amnesty International said today that NATO violated international law in its bombing war over Yugoslavia by hitting targets where civilians were sure to be killed.</p>
        <p>In particular, the human rights group said that NATO's bombing of the Belgrade headquarters of Radio Television Serbia, on April 23, 1999, ''was a deliberate attack on a civilian object and as such constitutes a war crime.'' Sixteen people died in the predawn attack, nearly all of them technicians, security workers  and makeup artists.</p>
        <p>NATO has defended the bombing as an attack on the ''propaganda machine'' of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>International law forbids direct attacks on civilians and civilian targets and requires all feasible precautions to prevent civilian deaths. In some cases, Amnesty said, NATO failed to take sufficient precautions to minimize civilian casualties. The number of civilian deaths from NATO air strikes ''could have been significantly reduced if NATO forces had fully adhered to the laws of war,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>Amnesty also condemned a NATO attack on a bridge at Varvarin on May 30, 1999, in which at least 11 civilians died. ''NATO forces failed to suspend their attack after it was evident that they had struck civilians,'' the report said, and it criticized NATO for ordering its pilots to fly so high that they could not take proper precautions against bombing civilians. In particular, the report criticized the bombing of convoys of Albanian refugees near Djakovica on April 14 and Korisa on May 13.</p>
        <p>The report was released less than a week after Carla Del Ponte, the chief prosecutor for the war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, told the United Nations  Security Council that her investigation had found no basis for charging NATO with war crimes. Mrs. Del Ponte said that although ''some mistakes were made by NATO,'' she was ''very satisfied that there was no deliberate targeting of civilians or unlawful military targets.''</p>
        <p>Still, some tribunal officials said privately that they hoped their report would cause NATO countries to review their rules of engagement in order to lessen the chances of civilian casualties.</p>
        <p>NATO's secretary general, Lord Robertson, called Amnesty's accusations baseless. He said that NATO ''made every effort to minimize civilian casualties.'' NATO's mistakes, he said, were few and should be weighed ''against the atrocities that NATO's action stopped.''</p>
        <p>The report by Amnesty does not try to weigh the violations committed by Serbian officials and forces; rather it tries to hold the members of NATO up to the highest standards of international law and behavior.</p>
        <p>The Amnesty report is similar in its findings to a detailed report by Human Rights Watch in February. Of the 500 or so Yugoslav civilians killed in Serbia and Kosovo by NATO bombs, half died because of NATO violations of laws and practices on protecting civilians, said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, in a telephone interview from New York.</p>
        <p>Amnesty was scathing about the bombing of the television station, which went off the air only briefly.  ''NATO deliberately attacked a civilian object, killing 16 civilians, for the purpose of disrupting Serb television broadcasts in the middle of the night for approximately three hours.''</p>
