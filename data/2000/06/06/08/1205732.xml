        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and City Council leaders joked this week about what to call them: the ''outer boroughs'' or the ''other boroughs''? But the reason for the bantering was no joke: the $37.6 billion budget approved this week includes an unusually large share of money and other perks for sections of the city outside Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The 2001 budget package includes $30 million in extra money to renovate or expand parks and cultural institutions in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. It also sweetens incentives for businesses to relocate to certain parts of the boroughs in an effort to broaden the city's recent economic boom.</p>
        <p>''The Manhattan economic renaissance has become somewhat self- sustaining,'' said Councilman Kenneth K. Fisher, a Brooklyn Democrat whose district would benefit from the economic development program. ''We have the opportunity and obligation to open up the winner's circle so other parts of the city can participate.''</p>
        <p>The borough-based extras are among the handful of special initiatives included in next year's budget, along with other items like the first significant increase in many years in funds for cultural institutions and an intensified pitch to stimulate biomedical research at teaching hospitals.</p>
        <p>The economic development program would, among other things, offer a tax credit to companies that relocate businesses from central Manhattan or from outside the city to Long Island City in Queens, Red Hook and parts of downtown Brooklyn, St. George in Staten Island and the Fordham Road section of the Bronx. The tax credit would be worth $3,000 a year for 12 years for each new employee.</p>
        <p>Even if the companies make no profits -- and therefore pay no business taxes -- they would get a $3,000 payment from the city for each relocated employee in the first two years. The city would also offer grants to help companies demolish buildings to prepare sites for new construction. And the relocating companies would be offered abatements on part of their property tax bill, all part of an effort to make it more affordable to move to the other boroughs, instead of, perhaps, New Jersey, city officials said.</p>
        <p>Some of the incentives already exist, but the new program offers enhancements, and it is intended to bring high-technology jobs to the other boroughs and prevent manufacturing jobs from leaving the city.</p>
        <p>''We need this; the city needs this,'' said Paul Bader, the owner of City Imprint Inc., a Manhattan-based printing company, who said he had seen too many other printing companies move out of the city because of rising costs in Manhattan and too few alternatives for relocation within the city. ''It is vital to the maintenance of manufacturing businesses.''</p>
        <p>The extra money for construction projects at parks and cultural institutions in the other boroughs -- the term that Mr. Giuliani told the Council members he preferred -- was added to the budget shortly before it was adopted this week.</p>
        <p>It includes $3 million to build soccer fields at Flushing Meadows in Queens, $3 million to renovate the fountain at Grand Army Plaza and Litchfield Villa in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and $1 million to renovate tennis courts at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, all in the coming year. These projects are in addition to other major capital projects in the other boroughs like a new courthouse on Jay Street in Brooklyn and a new Willis Avenue Bridge.</p>
        <p>Among other initiatives in the new budget is an increase of $7 million, amounting to $10 million, in grants that the city intends to offer hospitals and universities to further biomedical research. Another $2 million would be invested over the next two years to help build a biology research center at the City University of New York in upper Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jeremiah A. Barondess, the president of the New York Academy of Medicine, said that the city's share of federal biomedical research funds had dropped in recent years, making it harder for universities and hospitals to attract top researchers. The city grant fund, which he said he thought would be the only one of its kind in the country, should help reverse that trend.</p>
        <p>The budget also contains good news for cultural groups. An extra $7 million was put into the budget for institutions like the Brooklyn Museum, the Museum of Natural History, the Queens Botanical Garden, Wave Hill in the Bronx and Snug Harbor Cultural Center in Staten Island.</p>
        <p>''This is a much needed increase and the first substantive increase in more than a decade,'' said Arnold L. Lehman, director of the Brooklyn Museum. In 1990, the museum closed its doors for a second day each week. Officials would not say if they were considering returning to a six-day-a-week schedule.</p>
        <p>The budget also has $176,000 for each Council member to spend on programs for youths, senior citizens and other purposes. The amount is $20,000 more than what was allotted in the current fiscal year.. That money is going to dozens of groups, among them the Alzheimer's Association of Staten Island and the Astoria Youth League.</p>
        <p>City officials said they could accommodate the new initiatives in the 2001 budget while cutting taxes by more than $400 million and reducing overall city-taxpayer-financed spending by about 3 percent.</p>
        <p>But officials in the Independent Budget Office said yesterday that Mr. Giuliani's accounting method understated the actual increase in city spending, which they put at 8 percent.</p>
