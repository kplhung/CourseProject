        <p>GORE PLANS 'PROSPERITY TOUR'  Vice President Al Gore plans a ''progress and prosperity tour'' next week in which he will propose protecting Medicare by taking it off-budget, meaning he would remove it from annual budget fights. ''It's the next logical step to ensuring our long-term security,'' said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman. ''What Al Gore is going to be doing next week is talking about the choices that we face in terms of continuing economic strength.'' In contrast to President Clinton's ''poverty tour'' last year, the vice president's tour is intended to highlight the economic successes of the last eight years -- and by extension associate Mr. Gore with that success. The vice president said tonight at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles, ''progress and prosperity ought to be expected in this country.'' Mr. Gore's fly-around will include several of the crucial battleground states across the Rust Belt, including Ohio and Pennsylvania. Advisers said the tour was part of a long-planned strategy to emphasize the positive and optimistic aspects of Mr. Gore's candidacy. It is to coincide with the release of a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign this week to continue to redefine Mr. Gore's image.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>CHALLENGE IN MASSACHUSETTS  Jack E. Robinson, the Republican challenger to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, says reports of his campaign's demise have been greatly exaggerated. It looked unlikely for a while that Mr. Robinson would succeed in gathering the 10,000 signatures of voters he needed by Tuesday to qualify for the race. The Massachusetts secretary of state's office credited him with 10,139 signatures before the deadline passed, so Mr. Robinson, an entrepreneur, is still in the running. But he still faces another major obstacle: overcoming the disclosures about his personal life, including bad relations with women and traffic problems.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>FORD OFFERS BUSH ADVICE  Former President Gerald R. Ford says Gov. George W. Bush should consider picking an abortion-rights advocate as his running mate. Such a choice, he contends,  could be the difference between winning and losing a close race. ''We need a team that reflects the broadest possible spectrum of the Republican philosophy, which means somebody who is pro-choice, for example, or at least is more so than some Republicans would like,'' Mr. Ford said Monday in a speech at the National Press Club in Washington. ''To me, freedom means nothing if not the freedom to choose,'' he said. ''As Republicans, as conservatives, we regard life as very, very sacred. That's why we believe the individual conscience and the right to choose is a major, major factor in how we should live and how our country should survive.''</p>
