        <p>With his final order yesterday in the Microsoft antitrust case, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said yes to the government one more time. He has agreed with the government, almost without qualification, on the facts of the case, on the law and now on the harsh remedy of splitting the company in two.</p>
        <p>In Judge Jackson's Federal District Court, the result has been not just a defeat for Microsoft but a rout, not a closely fought legal contest but a judicial ratification of the government's case.</p>
        <p>Yet the two-year-old case is far from over. And with a year or two of appeals ahead, the chances of Microsoft's ever being broken up are uncertain. Microsoft will try to reverse every element in Judge Jackson's ruling that the company is a monopoly that has repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws, stifling software competition and innovation.</p>
        <p>The odds against Microsoft's winning outright on appeal are extremely high, according to antitrust experts. But they say that there are legally vulnerable points in the judge's ruling that if reversed on appeal might well enable the company to avoid the drastic sanction Judge Jackson has now endorsed.</p>
        <p>''Microsoft is going to try to whittle away at the judge's ruling on appeal,'' said Andrew I. Gavil, professor at the Howard University law school. ''And once you get an incremental erosion of the case, you erode the power of the argument for a breakup as well.''</p>
        <p>In his order yesterday, Judge Jackson acknowledged that the federal appeals court or the Supreme Court, or both, might disagree with some of his work. Two weeks ago, he surprised both sides in the case and most legal experts when he abruptly ended the court proceedings without a further round of hearings on the government's plan to split Microsoft in two and require a series of curbs on its business conduct.</p>
        <p>In his order, Judge Jackson explained that he had moved quickly because, if his findings or legal conclusions are overruled, a higher court might decide on its own remedies or send the case back to him.</p>
        <p>After noting that Microsoft contends it will be vindicated on appeal, he wrote: ''The court is well aware that there is a substantial body of public opinion, some of it rational, that holds to a similar view. It is time to put that assertion to the test.''</p>
        <p>So Judge Jackson chose this approach as a way to speed along a case of national economic importance. The alternative, he decided, would be to risk going through two time-consuming sets of hearings on remedies -- one based on his legal ruling and one based on a case perhaps scaled back on appeal.</p>
        <p>Still, some antitrust experts say that simply accepting the remedies plan from the Justice Department and states suing Microsoft could prove to be a mistake.</p>
        <p>''If he's assuming that this case is probably coming back to him anyway, I think that is a safe assumption,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University law school. ''But the danger of his approach is that it increases the chances it will come back to him.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft's prime target on appeal, antitrust experts say, will be the judge's ruling that it illegally tied its Internet browser to its monopoly product, the Windows operating system, which handles the basic operations on 85 percent of all PC's.</p>
        <p>To Microsoft, the tying charge is the heart of the case. If that ruling is upheld on appeal, Microsoft sees a threat to its corporate way of life --  its ability to add new software features to its operating system, as it has repeatedly over the years.</p>
        <p>In several rounds of settlement talks with the government, Microsoft was willing to change some of its practices, but it stood firm on not allowing any tampering with Windows or letting personal computer makers pick and choose from an ala carte menu of Windows features.</p>
        <p>To Microsoft, this stance is not arrogance or hubris -- or an antitrust violation, for that matter -- but a stand of principle.</p>
        <p>''This case, in our view, is about whether we are free to improve our products and whether we can protect the integrity of our most important product, Windows,'' said William Neukom, senior vice president and general counsel of Microsoft.</p>
        <p>Microsoft has argued that Web browsing software should not be considered as a separate product but as a feature in the ever-evolving Windows operating system.</p>
        <p>The government contended, and Judge Jackson ruled, that Microsoft had illegally tied its Internet browser, a separate product, to Windows to thwart competition and illegally protect its monopoly. To accept Microsoft's argument, the government said, would amount to granting the dominant software maker an exemption from broad swaths of the nation's antitrust laws.</p>
        <p>But antitrust experts note that product-tying charges are tricky, especially when dealing with software, in which the products are rendered in the 1's and 0's of programming code and product boundaries often blur. And a federal appeals court in June 1998 sided with Microsoft in a separate but related case. That court said Microsoft had the right to fold a browser into its operating system as long as it could make a ''plausible claim'' of consumer benefit.</p>
        <p>In addition to the tying charge, Microsoft, antitrust experts say, stands a good chance of getting a reversal on the court's finding that Microsoft made an illegal offer to Netscape Communications to divide the browser market between them. The collusion offer, Judge Jackson ruled, was made during a meeting between executives of Microsoft and Netscape, the commercial pioneer in Internet browsers, in June 1995.</p>
        <p>The legal hurdle in attempted collusion cases, antitrust experts say, is fairly high. The crucial case, they say, occurred in 1984 and involved airline executives talking about jointly raising fares in a conversation that was tape-recorded. Whether the meeting notes, e-mail messages and conflicting witness testimony about the Microsoft-Netscape meeting are evidence that reaches the standard of ''clearly unequivocal,'' established in the 1984 case, is open to question, experts say.</p>
        <p>Microsoft is also expected to argue  that much of the rest of the case -- mainly contracts and practices that the court found to be a ''pattern of anticompetitive behavior'' -- is merely evidence of a company competing aggressively in a dynamic industry, not of an economic outlaw.</p>
        <p>''We think this ruling is very vulnerable on appeal,'' Mr. Neukom said. ''We're in the middle innings of a contest that won't be over for another year or two. And the most critical innings are yet to come.''</p>
        <p>Yet antitrust experts say that the steepest uphill climb for Microsoft on appeal will be to overturn Judge Jackson's determination that the company engaged in an array of illegal acts to protect its monopoly, wielding its market power like a club to bully industry partners and rivals.</p>
        <p>''It's the whole gestalt that is a real problem for Microsoft -- the court's finding that these are bad guys, who repeatedly acted to stifle competition and not for any efficiency reasons,'' said Richard Steuer, an antitrust specialist and a partner at Kaye Scholer Fierman Hays &amp; Handler. ''That is a lot harder for an appeals court to overturn.''</p>
