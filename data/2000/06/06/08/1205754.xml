        <p>A strike by 2,200 pilots for Air Canada, which handles 80 percent of Canada's airline traffic, is possible by mid-June, after the pilot union's rejection of what the company called its final offer. But the union, the Air Canada Pilots Association, has not taken a strike vote, and a mediator assigned by the national government is still trying to bring the two sides to an agreement. The pilots, who have been without a contract since April 1, are seeking higher wages and pension benefits, and job protection during the integration of Air Canada with Canadian Airlines.</p>
