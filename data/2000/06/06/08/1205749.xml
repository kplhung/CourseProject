        <p>Even if Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's order to break up Microsoft survives appeal unscathed, potential competitors will not feel the impact of the antitrust trial for at least a year, industry executives said today.</p>
        <p>In part, they say, the culture in the software industry will take time to change. For example, they said it might take a year or more before investors like venture capitalists begin to finance potential competitors to Microsoft.</p>
        <p>''Within a year, you'll see some clever ideas coming out; within two years, you'll see some options'' for consumers, said James Barksdale, former president and chief executive of Netscape who is now a private investor in Silicon Valley.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barksdale said he believed that venture capitalists had just begun to finance competitors to Microsoft, but that they would greatly increase that once Microsoft's appeal of Judge Jackson's breakup ruling is rejected.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be at least a year before people believe it's going to take hold,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But there are deep divisions in Silicon Valley about when the court  decision will have an impact on competitors.</p>
        <p>Some say the shift is already under way, a shift driven by the market, not the courts. Heidi Roizen, a former Microsoft consultant and longtime friend of William H. Gates who is now a venture capitalist, said that the attitude toward financing potential Microsoft competitors changed a long time ago.</p>
        <p>For the last four or five years, one of the first questions a venture capitalist has asked was whether an entrepreneur was entering a business that belonged to Microsoft or that it could easily enter, but that is no longer the case, she said.</p>
        <p>''I've been a venture capitalist for a year and Microsoft has come up only once in a meeting,'' she said.  Attention to Microsoft has diminished because people's attention has shifted from operating system competition to the Internet.</p>
        <p>She described today as a sad day but said that, given the appeals process, ''it's going to be a long time before we know what's going to happen.''</p>
        <p>T. Paul Thomas, the president and chief executive of TurboLinux, which makes a version of the Linux operating system that competes with Microsoft's Windows, agreed some change is already under way because Linux ''still is the fastest-growing operating system.'' And, he said, it seems that Microsoft has already modified its business practices in light of the scrutiny by the government and Judge Jackson. ''They're more conscious of what they do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he said he believed that more fundamental change in business practices by Microsoft -- and innovations from competitors -- could be two or more years away because he expected the litigation to drag on and he believed that Microsoft is a formidable competitor.</p>
        <p>''Nothing is going to change at Microsoft today, nor is there going to be any change in the near term,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Executives at several of the top technology companies, including Novell, 3Com and Adobe Systems, declined to comment on the outcome of the antitrust trial. Throughout the trial, executives from many top technology companies have been silent about the proceedings.</p>
        <p>One exception has been Sun Microsystems Inc. Michael H. Morris, vice president and general counsel, said today that the company felt the verdict was ''justified.''</p>
        <p>He said Microsoft had engaged in a public relations effort to make it appear that the technology market is moving so quickly that it is unnecessary to split the company up. But Mr. Morris said Microsoft continued to ''have monopoly power today and the absolute ability to wield it ruthlessly.''</p>
        <p>He said he had not met one person who made a credible argument that market forces alone would mitigate Microsoft's behavior.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barksdale said that he felt vindicated by the court's decision, but that it might have come too late for the Netscape Navigator, a Windows competitor. ''I regret it didn't happen a few years sooner,'' he said. ''Navigator would've been a bigger option for people.''</p>
        <p>The decision also inspired continued criticism of the government from some in Silicon Valley. Alan M. Cooper, the founder and president of Cooper Interaction Design in Palo Alto, Calif., a software consulting company with 55 employees, said that he felt that some of Microsoft's behavior had been inappropriate, but that he did not believe the government should act so drastically.</p>
        <p>Specifically, he said the government action would not have the desired impact, in part because he still did not believe that venture capitalists and other investors would want to finance companies to compete against the major Microsoft businesses, even if those businesses were owned by two companies.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there is going to be a rush to jump into Microsoft's markets,'' he said.</p>
