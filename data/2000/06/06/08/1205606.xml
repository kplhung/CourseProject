        <p>WITH a little ingenuity, flexibility and the proper bed, no space is too small to be a guest bedroom. The right bed can be anything from a traditional army-style cot that stows in its own carry bag to a highly designed chrome chaise with a shiny nylon sleeping bag attached. Whether it's in-laws or friends who arrive for the weekend, any nook or corner can become host to a comfortable bed.</p>
        <p>1. A classic canvas cot, 25 inches wide by 76 inches long, from Maine, folds into its own carrying bag. The sturdy frame and legs are made of American hardwoods. The cot is available for $95 from the Garnet Hill catalog; (800) 622-6216 or www.garnethill.com.</p>

        <p>3. A folding corrugated cardboard futon platform called the Tara bed was designed by Valerie Jomini and Stanislas Zimmermann of Switzerland. The accordion-folded base, very compact when closed (inset left), is stabilized with two lengths of webbing that run through the base.

All are at Terminal-NYC, 28-30 Watts Street (Avenue of the Americas); www.terminal-nyc.com.</p>
        <p>The Swedish Weddingstool table, 17 inches high and made of walnut-stained oak, does double duty as a seat. The tables, which also come in white or black, can be connected to form a bench (shown from above, inset right). They are $265 each from Totem, 71 Franklin Street (Broadway); www.totemdesign.com or (888) 519-5587.</p>
        <p>4. This block of foam rubber (in fact, re-engineered oil filter material) by Masayo Ave, a Japanese designer, is firm and comfortable to sit or lie on; $1,065 for a child-size block, 24 by 47 inches, or $1,225 for the adult size, 24 by 71 inches. The blocks can also be used outdoors. Ms. Ave's orange table lamp is made of the same material and costs $85. All are at Totem.</p>
        <p>The orange sheepskin, $95, will be available at Ad Hoc Software's new location, 136 Wooster Street (Prince Street), after July 1.</p>
        <p>5. The Power Box, a chrome-framed chaise by Bjorn Dhalstrom, a Swedish designer, has an attached nylon sleeping bag and pillow. The chaise, which does not fully recline, is $1,200 and can be ordered from Totem.</p>
        <p>The rolling metal suitcase is from Flight 001, 96 Greenwich Avenue (Jane Street); www.flight001.com.</p>
        <p>The gray felt rug is $24.95 at Mxyplyzyk, 125 Greenwich Avenue (13th Street).</p>
        <p>6. The daybed, designed by Chris Lehrecke, has folding steel legs, a walnut platform and a twin-size custom-upholstered mattress. As shown, with wool fabric, the daybed is $5,400 at Pucci International, 44 West 18th Street.</p>
