        <p>The effect on consumers of yesterday's decision to split the Microsoft Corporation into two companies remains unclear, in large part because Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's orders are on hold until the appeals process is concluded, which could take years.</p>
        <p>But other factors are contributing to the uncertainty, including the profound shift to the Internet as the driving force of personal computers and the emergence of Internet-based consumer appliances and wireless devices that are independent of Microsoft's monopoly on desktop PC's.</p>
        <p>To prevent Microsoft from abusing its monopoly power in the future, Judge Jackson has ordered that it be broken into two separate companies, one for operating systems and one for applications and hardware.</p>
        <p>That may never happen if Microsoft is successful in its appeals. But some analysts suggest that the three-year Justice Department pursuit of Microsoft has already affected consumers, at least indirectly, by making Microsoft less blatantly aggressive against competitors.</p>
        <p>''The scrutiny that Microsoft has been under has already made them a better citizen and is giving the rest of the industry some breathing room,'' said Tim O'Reilly, chief executive of O'Reilly &amp; Associates of Sebastopol, Calif., a high-technology information provider.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's order also included behavioral remedies that could go into effect within 90 days. Among these are changes that could have a more immediate, although still indirect, effect on consumers.</p>
        <p>For example, Microsoft no longer would be able to require PC makers to buy a copy of Windows for every computer made, regardless of whether consumers want Windows. Because PC makers pass the cost of the software along to consumers, the price of some computers could fall, especially for inexpensive PC's in which the operating system is a more significant part of the price.</p>
        <p>Nor will Microsoft be able to compel computer makers to bundle other Microsoft products with the PC, like the Microsoft mouse, as a condition for favorable treatment.</p>
        <p>But a spokesman for the Dell Computer Corporation in Austin, Tex., said his company would continue to provide Microsoft products because customer demand for them remains exceptionally high. The demand for such products as Windows and Microsoft Office is not expected to abate just because the software comes from two different companies, he said.</p>
        <p>Judson True, assistant program director at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, which conducts debates and discussions on issues like business, technology and education, noted that both companies would have monopolies in their respective areas. ''When you've got one really big head, and then two really big heads, I don't understand what's going to really change.''</p>
        <p>''Windows drives me crazy,'' he added. ''I can't imagine it getting much worse.''</p>
        <p>Although it is easy to find people who are frustrated by Microsoft software, it is harder to find businesses willing to abandon it. Information systems managers are extremely reluctant to change software once it has been installed and is working properly and employees have been trained to use it. Microsoft's hold on the operating systems and major applications used by business computers is secure, analysts say.</p>
        <p>And because many consumers are familiar with Microsoft software because they use it at work, they have adopted it at home. As a result, demand for Microsoft products is expected to remain strong regardless of the eventual outcome of the antitrust case.</p>
        <p>''It's not going to change my life at all,'' said John Kelley, a PC user from Palo Alto, Calif., ''because I'm going to persevere through using Windows 98.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelley said he also used Corel WordPerfect GroupWise, a collection of application programs that compete against Microsoft Office.</p>
        <p>Microsoft Office dominates the application software category as thoroughly as Windows does in operating systems. Corel has doubled its market share over the last year, which indicates some gains against Microsoft, but it still has less than 1 percent of the market.</p>
        <p>''I have my own personal and emotional opinion, which is that I frankly would like to see the company split up,'' said Peter Carson, who works at the law firm of Cooley Godward in San Francisco. ''But if I look at it functionally, I don't think a split will have much of an impact on me.'' He said most of his clients used Microsoft software and that being compatible with them was beneficial.</p>
        <p>But while Microsoft's grip on desktop computing appears secure, new technologies are evolving that have no need for Microsoft.</p>
        <p>In the market for hand-held personal computers, the Palm operating system from Palm Inc. is dominant. Microsoft recently introduced a new version of its relatively unsuccessful Windows CE operating system, called Pocket PC, to gain ground against Palm. But yesterday, Sony announced that it would introduce a range of new consumer devices, including a hand-held computer, based on the Palm system.</p>
        <p>Analysts expect wireless phones and other hand-held devices to be the main conduit to the Internet in just a few years, passing personal computers, and so far, Microsoft has not had success in moving its operating systems, browsers or other applications to these devices. Indeed, almost all of the large cellular phone and handheld device companies have adopted an operating system called Symbian, which is not controlled by Microsoft but by major electronics companies led by Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola.</p>
        <p>''We have a new paradigm that is network centric rather than desktop centric,'' Mr. O'Reilly said. ''Most of the interesting new consumer applications are delivered over the Web, like eBay and Amazon.com. So in one sense, for Microsoft the cat is already out of the bag. Without the intervention of the government, many of these exciting new developments might be brought back under Microsoft's thumb.''</p>
