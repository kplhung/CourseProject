        <p>From Hispaniola  Influenced by Spanish, French, African and Caribbean cultures, much of Haitian art is created by self-taught painters in the folk tradition. Their works, often depicting Haitian history, daily life and religious experience, is simply composed, rich with color and without concern for commercial value. From Saturday through Sept. 3, more than 30 20th-century Haitian paintings owned by Mrs. Robert C. Graham, a leading collector of Haitian art in the 1970's and early 80's, will be exhibited in ''A Cultural Kaleidoscope'' at the Bruce Museum of Arts and Science in Greenwich, Conn.</p>
        <p>For the Masses  In the dismal years of the Depression the Federal Arts Project of the Works Project Administration gave work to nearly 10,000 artists, musicians, actors and writers. The artists turned out some 2,500 murals, 13,000 sculptures, 100,000 paintings and 239,000 prints in the eight years before the project ended in 1943. Beginning on Sunday at the Baltimore Museum of Art 70 engravings, lithographs and woodcuts will examine how W.P.A. artists identified with the American worker and changed printmaking. ''Art in a Day's Work: Prints From the W.P.A.,'' continues through Sept. 24.</p>

        <p>Timeless Tale  Known for his scores for films like ''Zorba the Greek,'' ''Z'' and ''Serpico,'' the Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis is also a prizewinning creator of symphonic works, song cycles, ballets, oratorios and operas. At 2 p.m. on Sunday the United States premiere of his opera ''Electra'' will be performed in a concert version at Carnegie Hall. With Peter Tiboris as conductor, the work stars the Greek-American mezzo-soprano Reveka Evangelia Mavrovitis as well as members of the Greek National Opera. Besides the Manhattan Philharmonic Orchestra, the forces will include the Nyack College Chorale, the Russian Chamber Chorus of New York and the Aquila Theater Company.</p>
        <p>New Generation  ''The Music Never Stops'' is the name given by 651 ARTS, the African-American performing arts group from Brooklyn, to a jazz program that brings together emerging musicians with seasoned artists. The jazz diva Abbey Lincoln, the pianist Geri Allen, the drummer Jack DeJohnette and the bassist Cecil McBee will perform in concert with a new generation of jazz talent at 8 on Saturday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater.</p>
