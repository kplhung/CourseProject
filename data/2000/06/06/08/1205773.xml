        <p>ALBANY: ABORTION BILL -- The State Senate yesterday approved a ban on what anti-abortion forces call partial-birth abortions, the third time it has done so. The Senate vote was 40 to 19, with Republicans voting 33 to 3 in favor, and Democrats voting 16 to 7 against. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, has prevented the issue from coming to a vote in the Assembly, where it appears to have enough votes to pass. Supporters say it bans a specific form of late-term abortion. Opponents say the measure improperly limits doctors' options.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: HATE CRIMES BILL -- The State Senate passed its first hate crimes bill yesterday, after years of Republican opposition. The Assembly had passed a different version of the bill, but lawmakers in both houses predicted that a compromise would be reached soon. The bill, supported by Gov. George E. Pataki, provides for added penalties when a victim is singled out because of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, national origin or disability. The vote was 48 to 12.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: MAN KILLED BY CAB -- A Manhattan man was struck and killed by a medallion cab yesterday as he crossed West 58th Street, the authorities said. The police said the man, Terrence Brown, 46, tried to cross the street in front of a parked delivery truck at 12:45 p.m. As he stepped past the truck, he was hit by a westbound cab and thrown into a scaffolding pole. He had not been crossing at a pedestrian crosswalk. Mr. Brown, of 792 Ninth Avenue, had just finished his job walking dogs at 235 West 58th Street, a resident of that building said. No summons was issued to the cabdriver.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: MEDICAL FRAUD TRIAL -- Federal prosecutors opened the trial of a woman accused of medical insurance fraud yesterday by charging that she performed medical procedures even though she was not a doctor, and that her clinic falsified insurance records. The woman, Sonia LaFontaine, was the director of LaFontaine-Rish Medical Associates, a plastic surgery clinic on West 57th Street. Prosecutors said that although doctors worked at the clinic, Ms. LaFontaine performed some procedures herself. Defense lawyers said there was no evidence that Ms. LaFontaine filled out or submitted insurance forms.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: UNION CORRUPTION -- A top union official who helped the state build its corruption case against District Council 37 could serve up to six years in jail for his role in the vote fraud and theft scandal. The official, Joseph DeCanio, the former president of Local 376, which represents 1,000 highway repair workers, was sentenced yesterday for grand larceny. Mr. DeCanio helped other union officials to buy holiday turkeys and cater union parties at inflated prices, and then to get cash back from the companies that sold the turkeys or did the catering for the difference between the real and inflated prices.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: CONSTRUCTION SCANDAL -- A second state employee pleaded guilty yesterday and faces up to six years in prison for siphoning more than $500,000 from court construction projects in Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island. The employee, Robert D'Avanzo, worked for the New York State Dormitory Authority, but also had his own company, B&amp;B Construction, which got contracts through bid rigging and which submitted inflated invoices to the state. In April, John Wilson, chief of court projects for the Dormitory Authority, also pleaded guilty to grand larceny.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: MARIJUANA ARRESTS -- Federal prosecutors charged 16 men yesterday with transporting marijuana from California for sale in New York. The prosecutors said that the men used tractor trailers to carry the marijuana to sites around New York City, including the Bronx Terminal Market, for distribution. From May 9 to May 19, prosecutors said, federal agents watched members of the ring buy 20 boxes of marijuana in the Los Angeles area. When federal officers searched the truck, prosecutors said, they found 2,000 pounds of marijuana.</p>

        <p>GARDEN CITY: NEW PROSECUTOR -- A veteran federal prosecutor, Jodi L. Avergun, was named yesterday to head the Long Island Division of the United States attorney's office for the eastern district. Ms. Avergun, who most recently specialized in drug and organized-crime cases, will succeed George A. Stamboulidis, who is to lead the government's case against Wen Ho Lee, the scientist accused of illegally downloading secret weapons data at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>HACKENSACK: MOLESTATION LAWSUIT -- Two boys who were among more than 100 youths sexually abused by the former principal of an Elmwood Park elementary school in the 1980's have been awarded $776,000 in a civil suit against him. A jury in Hackensack on Tuesday awarded the money to the boys, at least $550,000 of which will have to come from the former principal, Samuel R. Bracgiliano. The award settles an eight-year legal battle over claims by the boys that the school district was negligent in its oversight of Mr. Bracgiliano while he worked at the school.</p>

        <p>CAMDEN: PLEA IN MURDER CASE -- The second of two men accused of killing the wife of a prominent southern New Jersey rabbi will plead guilty today, his lawyer said. The man, Paul Daniels, is to plead guilty to aggravated manslaughter and robbery at a hearing in Camden, said the lawyer, Craig Mitnick. Mr. Daniels and Leonard Jenoff were charged with killing Carol Neulander of Cherry Hill in November 1994 at the behest of her husband, Rabbi Fred Neulander.</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>NEW HAVEN: NANNY DEATH -- A British man accused of bludgeoning his children's nanny to death will stand  trial. A plea agreement could not be worked out on a murder charge against the man, David Paul Taylor, 43, according to his lawyer, Mary Haselkamp. No date for a trial has been set. Mr. Taylor is accused of killing Milena Pitkova, 22, in March 1999. Ms. Pitkova, a native of the former Czechoslovakia, was his lover and cared for his children, ages 12 and 14, the authorities said.</p>
