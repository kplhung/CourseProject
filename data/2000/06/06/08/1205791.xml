        <p>For Edgardo Alfonzo, it was another typical game last night. He homered in the first inning to drive in the Mets' first run, tripled in the sixth to score the go-ahead run -- and somehow did nothing to draw attention to himself in an 11-3 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.</p>
        <p>Alfonzo is the Mets' stealth superstar, quietly posting great numbers while others get more fanfare. He is probably the National League's best second baseman, but he has never been an All-Star.</p>

        <p>For Edgardo Alfonzo, it was another typical game last night. He homered in the first inning to drive in the Mets' first run, tripled in the sixth to score the go-ahead run -- and somehow did nothing to draw attention to himself in an 11-3 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.</p>
        <p>Alfonzo is the Mets' stealth superstar, quietly posting great numbers while others get more fanfare. He is probably the National League's best second baseman, but he has never been an All-Star.</p>
        <p>''He's going to be a really special player when it's all said and done,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''Right now, he's one of the finest players in the game, but he keeps trying to improve. I'm really proud of him.''</p>
        <p>Alfonzo bats in front of Mike Piazza, the star catcher, and after Alfonzo delivered a functional, 382-foot homer to left last night, Piazza followed with a mammoth blast that traveled 64 feet farther, over the fence beyond the visitors' bullpen in left.</p>
        <p>In the sixth, when Alfonzo rifled a triple to right off Scott Erickson, it took his average to .350 and was the pivotal hit in a four-run inning that put the Mets ahead to stay. But the more memorable at-bat that inning was the one that tied the game.</p>
        <p>The rookie Jason Tyner, a slap-hitting leadoff man who has not homered since high school, turned on a pitch and sent Albert Belle retreating for the catch, just in front of the warning track. Kurt Abbott, who opened the inning with a triple, scored on the sacrifice fly.</p>
        <p>Abbott later doubled to start a five-run seventh inning that burst open the game.</p>
        <p>But in the sixth, the game was still close; the Orioles were leading, 3-2, when the Mets' starter, Rick Reed, left the game after throwing 99 pitches in five unsteady innings. Reed, pitching for the first time in 11 days after straining a muscle in his left side, allowed three runs on eight hits, including a homer by Cal Ripken.</p>
        <p>Reed said he was too strong after the layoff, throwing fastballs up in the zone -- dangerous territory for him. He said he finally stopped doing that against the last batter he faced, Belle, who struck out.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to overpower anybody, that's for sure,'' said Reed, who met with his fellow Marshall alumnus Chad Pennington of the Jets in the clubhouse after the game. ''That at-bat was probably the best I was throwing all night. I guess if you're going to end your night, you might as well end it on a positive note.''</p>
        <p>Tyner saved a run for Reed in the fourth inning, but it was almost his duty: he had allowed B. J. Surhoff to reach third when he dropped a fly ball by Ripken that went for a two-base error.</p>
        <p>Two batters later, Tyner got a running start on a fly by Charles Johnson, and lofted his throw home as Surhoff tagged up. The ball took one hop, Piazza reached up to get it and used his left foot to block Surhoff's path to the plate, applying the tag and completing the double play.</p>
        <p>Alfonzo, meanwhile, was happy to spread the credit among the whole team. ''This was a pretty good game, from the first at-bat to the end,'' Alfonzo said. ''It was a good sign that we put everything together tonight.''</p>
        <p>The Mets and the Orioles conclude their three-game series tonight, but the Orioles left town last night. Because Tuesday's rained-out game was rescheduled for today, the Orioles needed an extra night at the Grand Hyatt and could not get it.</p>
        <p>Needing 53 rooms, the Orioles said they looked for hotels as far north as Stamford, Conn., as far south as Princeton, N.J., and well into Long Island, with no luck. Some players found single rooms at hotels in and around the city. The rest of the team will fly back to New York this afternoon.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>While five Oriole relievers allowed the Mets a total of five runs last night, three Mets relievers shut out Baltimore for four innings. PAT MAHOMES pitched one inning and improved to 2-1. DENNIS COOK followed with a scoreless seventh and RICH RODRIGUEZ threw two scoreless innings. It was only the fifth time in 18 games that Rodriguez was not scored upon. . . . The right-hander BOBBY J. JONES, who has a 9.64 earned run average in seven starts, worked extensively on his curveball during a bullpen session yesterday. Jones will start on Saturday at Yankee Stadium, and he insists he is full of confidence. ''If you sit back and listen to what people say, how bad you are, what your E.R.A. is, you're just digging yourself a hole,'' Jones said. Manager BOBBY VALENTINE said the Mets never considered replacing Jones in the rotation this weekend -- ''He's pretty solidified as a starter,'' Valentine said -- but he made no commitments about his rotation beyond the Yankee series.</p>
        <p>The Mets would like to upgrade in their rotation, and the Phillies' ANDY ASHBY could emerge as a candidate in a trade. Ashby is 2-6 this year, but he won 31 games for San Diego in 1998 and '99 and said this week he would probably test the free-agent market after the season.</p>
        <p>''If a top-of-the-rotation starting pitcher was available, there would be -- and there are -- multiple teams that would be interested,'' Phillies General Manager ED WADE said yesterday. ''If we get to that point, we would certainly try to do what's best and what's the right decision for the Phillies. But our hope is still to try to get an extension done.''</p>
        <p>Speaking generally, Wade said he would not ''shrink the landscape'' by failing to consider deals with other National League East teams, like the Mets. The Mets do not expect Ashby to become available until closer to the July 31 trading deadline.</p>
