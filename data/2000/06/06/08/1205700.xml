        <p>Michael J. Bragman seems like a broken man these days, shunned by his colleagues and banished from the stately oak-paneled offices in the Capitol that are reserved for people of privilege.</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry,'' he said the other day, choking back tears. ''This is not like me.''</p>
        <p>The name Mike Bragman used to inspire awe around here. He is the shrewd politician who survived a bribery scandal early in his career. The tough legislative floor leader who squelched dissent in the State Assembly. The deal maker who helped build a minor league baseball stadium, bus and train terminal,  farmers' market and other pet projects that he delivered to his Syracuse district.</p>
        <p>But then it all unraveled late last month with an act of defiance that transformed Mr. Bragman from an  Albany insider to an outcast.</p>
        <p>He declared war on the State Capitol's notorious culture of secrecy, money politics and high-priced lobbying, the very culture in which he once thrived. He organized a small band of lawmakers to oust the person he partly blames for the troubling state of affairs: the speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan, beat back the coup attempt and stripped Mr. Bragman of all the trappings of power: his ceremonial office just off the floor of the Assembly; a spacious office across the street from the Capitol building; $34,500 in a leadership stipend; and, above all, the title of majority leader. The speaker continued to exact punishment this week, cutting Mr. Bragman's $1.36 million staff budget and leaving him with only 2 of the 24 people he used to employ.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Bragman, a Democrat himself, had succeeded in throwing the chamber into chaos and casting a stark spotlight on the inner workings of a Legislature that critics have sneeringly accused of operating with the secrecy and tight party control of a Soviet bloc nation.</p>
        <p>He accused Mr. Silver of stifling debate on major issues to serve his own agenda, diminishing the influence of legislative committees and giving lobbyists greater roles than  average lawmakers have. Mr. Bragman said the system prompted some of the brightest lawmakers to quit or consider quitting rather than be reduced to bit players.</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Bragman may get the changes he says he is seeking. Mr. Silver and his colleagues are  moving to create a package of proposals intended to establish more democratic rules in the chamber and, in the process, give rank-and-file lawmakers far more influence over policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman's outspokenness was considered remarkable in Albany, where the leaders of both houses wield an extraordinary level of power. The leaders have the sole authority to determine the fate of legislation, the amount of state money that lawmakers receive for their districts, the type of committee assignments they get and even the size of their paychecks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman knew this, and yet,  he risked political suicide. So what was he thinking?</p>
        <p>His critics say his actions were simply a grab for power. All his talk of government reform, they say, was merely a convenient cover to mask  oversized ambition. They note that he was once a part of Mr. Silver's inner circle and that he never shied away from carrying out the speaker's orders, no matter how high-handed they were.</p>
        <p>''His talk of reform is a strategic move fashioned to save face after his loss,'' said Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Mr. Silver.</p>
        <p>''In the past six years he has never once raised the issue of reform,'' Ms.  Lynch added. ''He was a part of the establishment until the day he lost in the power struggle.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman called such criticism mud-slinging. He said he knew full well that he could lose everything by going after Mr. Silver, but did so anyway out of principle. He even accepted some blame for the Capitol's oppressive system, suggesting that he should have spoken up sooner.</p>
        <p>''I can't tolerate it anymore,'' he said. ''I'd rather get out. I'd rather quit.''</p>
        <p>He's not giving up anytime soon, though. Despite his defeat, he poses a threat to Mr. Silver, because he has the support of at least 20 Democratic lawmakers who pledged to stand with him as an opposition bloc that could shadow the speaker's every move. Members say Mr. Bragman's coup attempt weakened Mr. Silver's grip on the House, and left him vulnerable to a challenge in the fall, when he faces re-election for another term as speaker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman, too, has been shaken by Mr. Silver's swift and cutting retribution.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I am going to have to go into the witness protection program,'' he joked in a recent interview. But then, as if the gravity of his downfall had suddenly hit him, he leaned forward in his chair and said: ''I'm human. Do you think I want to leave the trappings of this office? I don't want to lose this.''</p>
        <p>But, he added, ''There comes a time when you have to do the right thing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman, 59, has long been one of the most intriguing figures in the Assembly, a behind-the-scenes player with a booming voice and the polished bearing of a military officer. He started his career as a high school teacher after graduating from Syracuse University in 1963 with a bachelor's degree in history and anthropology.</p>
        <p>He entered politics two years later, when he was elected to the Town Council in his hometown of Cicero, a small rural community just outside Syracuse. Then, in 1969, he successfully ran for the County Legislature. He was the first Democrat to be elected chairman of the Legislature in a county that is overwhelmingly Republican.</p>
        <p>He won election to the State Assembly in 1980. But his first year in office was marred by scandal. In 1981, Mr. Bragman was indicted on a charge of asking $1.6 million in bribes from a company that tried to sell a garbage-burning steam plant to Onondaga County when he was chairman of the County Legislature. He was acquitted after a highly publicized trial.</p>
        <p>With his legal troubles behind him, Mr. Bragman worked to develop a reputation as an independent-minded lawmaker in the Assembly, criticizing his own party's appetite for tax increases and government regulation, and other policies that he said stifled business.</p>
        <p>His positions made him popular among many of the state's most powerful business leaders, who, in turn, contributed generously to his campaign. To this day, he is one of the most formidable fund-raisers in the Legislature, with tobacco companies, banks, insurers and other corporate contributors filling his list of donors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman became majority leader in 1993, barely a year before Mr. Silver was elected speaker. He proved to be one of Mr. Silver's most important allies, at least at the beginning. He sided with Mr. Silver's effort to distance the State Democratic Party from its traditionally liberal positions on issues like crime and tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver pushed the Assembly rightward in recognition of the 1994 electoral tide that brought a Republican, George E. Pataki, into the governor's mansion for the first time in a generation. In doing so, Mr. Silver angered many liberals in the chamber, who were shoved aside as more conservative Democrats like Mr. Bragman gained greater control.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman's loyalty in those days was amply rewarded. He was one of the Legislature's greatest beneficiaries of pork-barrel spending, getting millions of dollars each year. He directed the money to expensive  projects in his district. His announcements of financing for such projects are often treated as front-page news in central New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman lives in a manner befitting the power and stature he has amassed. He and his wife, Suzanne, own a home in a sprawling development he built where the streets are named after their children.</p>
        <p>He also holds what has become one of the largest Democratic political events in upstate New York: an annual clambake that draws several thousand people each year, particularly politicians seeking Mr. Bragman's support in local, state and even national elections.</p>
        <p>It is a measure of the influence he still has that Hillary Rodham Clinton, Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer and State Comptroller H. Carl McCall showed up at this year's event three days after the failed coup.</p>
        <p>''Mike speaks with leadership and with integrity,'' Mr. Spitzer told the crowd of 3,500 people. ''He's been a leader in Albany, and he will continue to be a leader in Albany.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman's critics like to say that he was the wrong man to carry a message of reform. They argue that it was disingenuous for him to complain about Mr. Silver's leadership, given how much he benefited from it. His continued political agitation, they added, could only hurt the party.</p>
        <p>''The issue is not whether Shelly Silver should be speaker,'' said Richard N. Gottfried, a Democratic assemblyman from Manhattan. ''The issue is whether a small group of members will undermine the Democratic majority in the Assembly.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman acknowledged that he was an improbable spokesman for change. ''I am not your straight reformer,'' he said. ''I've scratched and I've clawed to get where I got. But you can be a tough politician while standing for reform.''</p>
        <p>It is unclear what will become of Mr. Bragman's political career, but he said he had no regrets, stressing that he was ''free to say and do the things I believe are necessary to bring about reform and change.''</p>
        <p>On occasion, he displayed an evangelical zeal, particularly when his former boss's name came up.</p>
        <p>''I'll tell you why he is worried about me,'' he said of Mr. Silver. ''He's worried about me because I am dangerous to him.</p>
        <p>''I know the rules of the House. I know how the budget works. I know how his mind works. That's why I am dangerous to him.''</p>
