        <p>Mars spacecraft have gotten a lot of bad press in the last year or so, but the Mars Global Surveyor has been a good Boy Scout since it was launched in 1996 (and like a good Boy Scout, it even helped in the search for one of the spacecraft that was lost).</p>

        <p>The images include high-resolution shots of specific surface elements, regional views of larger-scale features and wide-angle strips covering thousands of miles that show weather patterns.</p>
        <p>The high-resolution images tend to be the most interesting, and potentially the most useful to Internet millionaires planning their next real estate purchase -- a ranchette, perhaps, in the foothills of Olympus Mons.</p>
