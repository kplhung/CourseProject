        <p>The centerpiece of the government's cure for the predatory, monopolistic, take-no-prisoners behavior that Microsoft was found to have embraced is to chop the company in two.</p>
        <p>One new company would make the Windows operating system, the other would make the applications that are run by the operating system, as well as Microsoft's Internet and computer hardware businesses. The government called the companies ''Ops Co.'' and ''Apps Co.'' in court papers.</p>
        <p>If Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decree upholding the government's argument is sustained on appeal, Microsoft would not be able to keep the vow made in court by its lawyer, John L. Warden.</p>
        <p>''We will not acquiesce in our own commercial demise,'' Mr. Warden declared.</p>
        <p>If not acquiescing, Microsoft would at least have to cooperate in radical surgery.</p>
        <p>Unless Microsoft is granted a stay pending appeal, it must give Judge Jackson and the Justice Department's antitrust division a reorganization plan by early October.</p>
        <p>So Microsoft, which consisted of three people and had sales of $16,000 in its first year, 1975, and now has 36,000 employees and annual sales of $20 billion, would cease to exist in its present form.</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson's decree spelled out how the present Microsoft, and the new companies that would arise from it, must behave toward each other and toward other companies -- some of which have been bitter competitors or even adversaries in court.</p>
        <p>Distinct Companies</p>
        <p>Once Microsoft submits its proposed plan, the Justice Department and the states that joined in the lawsuit would have 60 days to file objections. Microsoft would then have 30 days to respond.</p>
        <p>After the judge reviews the new paperwork and issues a final reorganization plan, and assuming the government wins on appeal, reorganization would take place within a year.</p>
        <p>The two entities are to have separate employees, assets and intellectual properties. There would be separate stock, so that principals in ''Ops Co.'' could not own stock in ''Apps Co.''</p>
        <p>The judge described the fire wall against anything that resembled cross-ownership or excessive coziness between the new companies.</p>
        <p>No board member of one can acquire securities or assets of the other. No one who is an officer, director or employee of one business shall be an officer, director or employee of the other.</p>
        <p>The operating-system business and the applications business are barred from merging, recombining or entering into joint ventures for 10 years. The new companies are barred, for the most part, from entering into any agreement under which one develops, sells, licenses or distributes products or services developed, sold, licensed or distributed by the other.</p>
        <p>One company cannot provide the other with any technical information that is not ''made readily available'' to other makers of computer products. Nor can the two companies license, sell or make available to each other ''any product or service'' on better terms than are offered to outside companies.</p>
        <p>The new companies are allowed to license technologies (other than middleware, like e-mail programs or browsers) to each other, provided the technologies have not been separately sold, licensed or offered as a product.</p>
        <p>No Retaliation</p>
        <p>For the moment, Microsoft is ordered to do its best to run both the operating systems end of its business and the applications branch at a profit, and to support research and development for both.</p>
        <p>Microsoft must do nothing ''that undermines, frustrates, interferes with, or makes more difficult'' the reorganization. Again, unless it is granted a stay, Microsoft must file a report no later than 90 days from now on steps it is taking to comply with this portion of the decree.</p>
        <p>Until the reorganization takes effect, the present Microsoft is not to punish or threaten any computer maker for using, distributing, promoting, licensing, producing or selling any product or service that competes with Microsoft. (This and other restrictions on conduct would remain in effect for three years if the breakup takes place, 10 years if the breakup is rejected on appeal.)</p>
        <p>Microsoft must license its Windows operating-system products to computer makers under uniform royalty terms, with exceptions granted for different language versions and ''reasonable'' volume discounts.</p>
        <p>Microsoft may not stop a computer maker that uses the Windows system from modifying its start-up sequence and desktop so that Microsoft icons, start-menu entries and other features are removed -- as long as users can get them back, if they want. Nor can Microsoft restrict a computer maker from offering its own Internet-access provider.</p>
        <p>Microsoft cannot terminate a computer maker's license to use Windows without providing a written notice and allowing the computer maker at least 30 days to correct its supposed shortcomings.</p>
        <p>To ensure that Microsoft shares technical information with all hardware, software and computer makers that are entitled to it, Microsoft must create ''a secure facility'' where representatives of those companies can study it.</p>
        <p>With limited exceptions, Microsoft cannot interfere with the performance of any non-Microsoft middleware that operates with any Windows operating-system product.</p>
        <p>Microsoft is not to give or withhold any consideration, or take or threaten any action, based on a hardware or software maker's use of a Microsoft product or service, or its choice of non-Microsoft products or services. And it must not enter into arrangements in which third parties agree or are offered considerations to favor certain Microsoft products to the exclusion of non-Microsoft products.</p>
        <p>Microsoft cannot link the licensing of a Windows operating system to a customer's agreement to use other Microsoft products. Strict limits are placed on Microsoft's binding middleware products to operating-system products.</p>
        <p>In general, Microsoft is barred  from penalizing computer makers who install Windows but choose not to use Microsoft middleware.</p>
        <p>The new companies cannot retaliate against ''any person or entity'' for providing evidence in the lawsuit against Microsoft.</p>
        <p>And when Microsoft releases a new version of Windows, it must continue selling the previous version without raising the price and offering service and support for it.</p>
        <p>Compliance</p>
        <p>Barring a stay, Microsoft has 90 days to set up a compliance committee on its board.</p>
        <p>That committee is to hire a compliance officer, who would be given broad powers to see that Microsoft obeys the ruling. Among other things, the compliance officer would  obtain written statements from senior corporate officers certifying that they have read the court's ruling, understand it and will abide by it.</p>
        <p>The compliance officer is to report immediately to the court and government any violations of the ruling.</p>
        <p>The e-mail messages of high-ranking Microsoft executives engaged in software development are to be saved for at least four years.</p>
        <p>The court reserves the right to act on its own to issue orders ensuring compliance with the ruling, and to punish violations.</p>
        <p>The court's final judgment will expire in 10 years.</p>
