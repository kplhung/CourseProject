        <p>The Washington Wizards' rambling search for a coach has taken them to the University of Miami, where Leonard Hamilton said today that he was thinking over an offer.</p>
        <p>''You have to understand this is not an easy thing for me,'' because he is close to his players and staff, Hamilton said at a hurriedly assembled late-afternoon news conference. ''I just need time to sort this out and come to some conclusion that I feel I'll be most comfortable with.''</p>
        <p>One potential hurdle for the Wizards in securing Hamilton is a buyout clause that is part of the seven-year contract for about $700,000 a year that he signed with Miami in April. The buyout could cost the Wizards as much as $2 million, a person close to Hamilton said.</p>
        <p>Michael Jordan, Washington's president of basketball operations, had hoped before now to have a replacement for Darrell Walker, who was fired as the head coach. Jordan had informal talks with Roy Williams of Kansas, Eddie Fogler of South Carolina, Tubby Smith of Kentucky and John Thompson, the retired Georgetown coach, before going after Lenny Wilkins, the former Atlanta Hawks coach.</p>
        <p>Wilkins even announced that he had the job, but negotiations broke down. Then Jordan turned to St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis. The two sides ultimately could not agree on Jarvis's remuneration, and he withdrew his name from consideration.</p>
        <p>Now Jordan is clearly focused on Hamilton, a longtime friend. Hamilton indicated today that he had not accepted the job, despite a report today in The Washington Post that had him locked up for four years at about $2 million a year.</p>
        <p>''Like most of us, I am ambitious and always try to strive to be the best in my profession,'' Hamilton said. ''So when an opportunity is made available, the only right thing to do is to give it strong consideration -- weigh the pluses and minuses -- and make the best possible decision you can in a timely fashion.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton, 51, has a 144-147 record in 10 seasons at Miami, but has produced six straight winning seasons, including last season, when the Hurricanes went 23-11 and made the Round of 16 in the National Collegiate Athletic Association for the first time .</p>
        <p>Miami's athletic director, Paul Dee, while indicating that the university likely would not enhance Hamilton's financial deal to persuade him to stay, said his departure would be a crippling blow.</p>
        <p>''He's just been wonderful for this program,'' Dee said. ''Certainly that's what makes him attractive for the N.B.A. I can't say enough about Leonard Hamilton. It would be difficult to lose somebody at that level, especially given the respect he has among fans, the university and his players.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton said: ''This situation does create a lot of anxiety within me because I love my kids, love what I do and enjoy the building process. The things that normally discourage people have a tendency to fire me up. I like challenges. I like being part of something that maybe needs a little work.''</p>
        <p>That job challenge could easily describe the lowly Wizards as well.</p>
