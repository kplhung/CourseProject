        <p>In a vote of confidence for Brazil's recently opened oil industry and potential oil resources, petroleum companies from around the world spent about $262 million to buy 21 onshore and offshore drilling sites. Brazil's state-owned oil company Petroleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras, spent $152 million for winning bids on seven of the sites. The winners, which also include Chevron, Shell Brasil and Union Pacific, are expected to invest more than $1 billion in the next five years. Last June, the government auctioned 12 oil drilling sites for $178 million.</p>
