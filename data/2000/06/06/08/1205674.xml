        <p>Despite being vastly outspent, Roy S. Moore, the Alabama judge made famous by his defense of the Ten Commandments, won a convincing victory in Tuesday's Republican primary for chief justice of that state's Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>''Of course, we give our first recognition to God,'' Judge Moore said in an interview today. ''He has providence over us, and his will is something that can't be thwarted.''</p>
        <p>Judge Moore, who sits on the Circuit Court in Gadsden, was running against three opponents, all of them well-respected judges. One, Associate Justice Harold See of the State Supreme Court, was the consensus favorite of Alabama's business community and raised more than $1.1 million for the race, four times more than Judge Moore.</p>
        <p>And yet, Judge Moore won 55 percent of the vote, surprising many political analysts by easily avoiding a runoff. Justice See finished second, with 30 percent, followed by Judge Pam Baschab of the Court of Criminal Appeals with 8 percent and Judge Wayne Thorn of Circuit Court in Birmingham with 7 percent.</p>
        <p>Judge Moore, 53, will now face Judge Sharon Yates, a Democrat who sits on the Court of Civil Appeals, in the general election in November. Judge Yates had no opposition in her party's primary.</p>
        <p>Polls taken only days before Tuesday's primary suggested that Judge Moore and Justice See were in a tight race and would probably find themselves in a runoff. But with little interest in other races on the ballot, including a pair of meaningless presidential primaries, turnout was low across the state. The poor turnout apparently benefited Judge Moore, whose Christian conservative supporters showed their commitment by getting to the polls.</p>
        <p>It was the second significant victory for the religious right in Alabama in less than a year. Last October, Christian conservatives mobilized to defeat a referendum that would have permitted a state lottery.</p>
        <p>Judge Moore received national attention three years ago when he defied another judge's order that he remove a handmade wooden tablet of the Ten Commandments that he had hung behind his bench. He also continued to invite pastors to begin court sessions with a prayer, again despite a judge's order to stop. The judge's rulings came in response to a lawsuit against Judge Moore filed by the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>
        <p>Ever since then, Judge Moore has become an icon of the Christian conservative movement, praised at rallies across Alabama and invited to speak around the country. He makes it clear in his talks that he believes that God's law, as revealed in the Bible, is the source of man's law and that Christian principles form the foundation of American government and jurisprudence. He said today that if he won in November, he would take his Ten Commandments plaque with him to the Supreme Court, though he did not know whether he would hang it in his chambers or behind the court's bench.</p>
        <p>Judge Moore's victory places Alabama's traditionally Republican business leaders in a bind. They are likely to find Judge Yates difficult to embrace, and may also fear that Alabama will again be portrayed as a backwater should Judge Moore become the chief justice. In 1998, many business leaders opposed the incumbent Republican governor, Fob James Jr., because he had emphasized conservative stands on social issues, particularly school prayer, to the detriment of the state's industrial recruitment efforts. Mr. James won the primary, but was wounded and lost the general election.</p>
        <p>Bill O'Connor, the president of the Business Council of Alabama, said his members would have to re-evaluate the race in light of Justice See's defeat.</p>
        <p>''Our concern is simply that we help to elect judges who follow the law and don't make the law from the bench,'' Mr. O'Connor said.</p>
        <p>Wayne Flynt, a historian at Auburn University, predicted that the general election would be tight, and that the primary showed that Judge Yates would have to be careful in how she challenged Judge Moore.</p>
        <p>''She can't make fun of him,'' Mr. Flynt said. ''She has to talk about her respect for the Ten Commandments and how she can understand why people might want to have them on courtroom walls but that there are other issues. If she makes him a martyr, he'll win by a landslide.''</p>
