        <p>SOMEHOW the niche between a palm-size organizer and a notebook has never been successfully colonized. Big companies are about to withdraw their bigger handheld entries from the market. I.B.M. withdrew months ago, and Hewlett-Packard will stop production of its larger handheld this month, although it will continue to produce its tiny handheld with non-touch-type keyboard, which has been selling well.</p>
        <p>Compaq, Sharp, NEC and a few others still make so-called PC companions, devices with keyboards that are bigger than an organizer's but smaller than a notebook's. But they run on Microsoft's Windows CE operating system, which draws its look and feel from its big brother operating system, Windows 98.  And Microsoft is not saying whether it will allow the Windows CE system to fade away while it concentrates its marketing muscle on its even tinier Pocket PC software for palm-size computers.</p>
        <p>I hope that Windows CE  and the bigger handhelds that run it do not disappear, but if they do, there is a product from Britain by Psion PLC waiting in the wings.</p>
        <p>The Psions, organizers with keyboards, have always been competition for the palm-size computers and have been popular in Europe, with some following here. The new Psion Series 7 is the most powerful yet. It looks like a notebook computer, but does not carry all the overhead like a hard drive or the ability to run the same programs you use on the desktop. Instead it runs scaled-down applications that offer the bare minimum of services required to write, calculate, stay on schedule and in touch with contacts, send and receive e-mail and connect to the Web.</p>
        <p>About the size of a large paperback book, the Series 7 weighs in at just over 2.5 pounds. The black case is made of hard plastic partially sheathed in bumpy black leather, giving the device a sort of high-tech-meets-classic-Day Timer appearance.</p>
        <p>The $900 Series 7's color screen, which is 7.7 inches from corner to corner, may seem awfully small when compared with full-fledged notebook computers costing only a few hundred dollars more, but if you compare it with a Palm or a Pocket PC handheld, that is another matter. Like the larger Windows CE handhelds, which have no hard disks and power on instantly without the lengthy boot up times of regular computers, the Psion Series 7's attraction lies not in its ability to be a notebook computer, but rather to offer the essence of one.</p>
        <p>Psion estimates that unlike notebooks, whose batteries fizzle out after a few hours, the Series 7's rechargeable battery will last about eight and a half hours before you need to plug the power adapter into the wall. The battery in the Series 7 I tested lasted at least four hours with no signs of running out, although I did not run it longer than that without its being plugged in.</p>
        <p>The included synchronization software works with Windows computers, shuttling word processing, spreadsheet and personal information manager (PIM) data back and forth. An included cable plugs into the Psion's serial port on one end and the computer's on the other.</p>
        <p>A double click of the synchronization icon shuttles personal information between the Psion 7's Agenda, To-Do, e-mail and Contacts information and any version of Microsoft Outlook running on a Windows desktop computer. Unfortunately, Microsoft Outlook's Post-It-like screen notes are not supported in the transfer, which I find disappointing since I use them frequently.</p>
        <p>Where Windows CE manages to do the transfer and translation between big computer and little computer automatically on all application fronts, the Psion requires manual intervention to shuttle documents; Word and Excel files must be dragged and dropped into and out of the Psion 7's folders, and you have to activate the file transfer utility to take documents with you or update on the desktop. It would be nice if the Psion figured out that part by itself, like Windows CE.</p>
        <p>The Series 7, however, does something Windows CE has never done: it works with Macintoshes. Currently, optional software lets Mac users back up data stored on the Series 7, and Psion says next month it will offer beefed-up Mac software to enable synchronization with several popular e-mail and organizer programs. As for entering information by hand, the device's keyboard is smaller than the standard desktop keyboard, but the difference is not very noticeable when touch typing -- except for the awkwardly placed question mark and slash key. Having to stretch the right pinky to reach for the question mark key is maddening.</p>
        <p>The touch-sensitive screen flips back nicely and is complemented on either side with 10 on-screen buttons for starting the built-in programs. All of them, as well as icons and other objects or text on the screen, respond to the fingernail or the included stylus, which pops out of the side of the Series 7.</p>
        <p>Four of the on-screen buttons may be customized to run secondary programs -- included applications that are not linked to screen buttons -- or ones you have installed yourself. Psion thoughtfully dedicates two buttons to the ability to zoom in and out of the screen's text in any application and have the system remember that size for any other application. It is a wonder such a feature is not easily available on desktop computers, because it eases eyestrain when the text is enlarged while typing articles  like this and is equally useful for dropping the text size down a few notches to make more of it fit on the screen when viewing Web pages. Text views and font sizes can be changed in most Web browsers and word processing programs, but with much less ease.</p>
        <p>When it comes to the Web, the Psion, which uses an operating system called Symbian EPOC, is not as adept as competing products that run Windows CE. Figuring out how to connect in the first place is a bit tricky because of the machine's Eurocentric default settings. But once the country and area code settings are typed in, the Psion 7 is ready to make the connection by way of a PC Card modem slipped into its available slot.</p>
        <p>Psion provided its own 56K version for this review, though almost any PC Card modem should work. Once connected, Web pages appear nicely in all their colorful glory, though certain sites built with complicated or multicolumn layouts don't always look they way they do on a desktop or notebook computer screen.</p>
        <p>Besides connecting with a modem, the Psion has an infrared port for beaming bits of information to other Psions or Palm OS handheld computers. The infrared port can also be aimed at the infrared port of GSM-equipped mobile phones for dialing into the Net. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) is a digital cellular telephone standard in use in more than 60 countries, including much of Europe. Trial GSM systems have been set up in the United States.</p>
        <p>A Compact Flash slot accepts memory cards to give the Psion more room for storing documents and information, but the unit's 16 megabytes of RAM was more than  big enough for storing my few hundred contacts, birthday reminders and two novels. Since the Psion's programs are built into the unit's ROM, they don't take up storage space.</p>
        <p>Additional touches include a database program, a sketch program and a notes program. All of the Psion Series 7's applications can accept and display text scribbled with the stylus and pictures imported from Web sites or the desktop computer. The extra feature I am most grateful for is the voluminous spelling and thesaurus program, which proves indispensable when searching for just the right word while revising chapters of my next novel.</p>
        <p>But helpful as it is, the thesaurus is not reason enough for me to replace the Hewlett-Packard Jornada 820 running Windows CE that I rely on for my away-from-home computing. I have three reasons: 1) It synchronizes all my personal data -- including Outlook Notes -- and documents without my ever having to think about it, whereas the Psion is prickly in the same matters; 2) it runs AOL Instant Messenger, which the Psion cannot; and 3) I prefer the Jornada's notebook-style touchpad to the Psion's stylus-dependent touchscreen.</p>
        <p>But if I did not already own the Jornada 820 -- whose days, according to HP, are sadly numbered, with production of the device ending this month -- the Psion Series 7 would probably be my first choice as a companion to my desktop computer. Given time and a little tweaking to improve its compatibility with Windows and Macs, the Psion Series 7 could even unseat the few but significant larger handhelds running Windows CE. Assuming, that is, that Microsoft does not pull the plug on its own invention beforehand.</p>
