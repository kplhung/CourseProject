        <p>Kevin Lowe was scheduled to meet again today with Cal Nichols, chairman of the 37-man group that owns the Edmonton Oilers. By tomorrow the Oilers should know whether Lowe, 41, will be their next general manager or leave the organization.</p>
        <p>The Oilers released a statement yesterday confirming that Lowe resigned as coach on Monday. ''We are now at a deadline,'' Lowe said yesterday by telephone. ''If we don't have some understanding by Thursday or Friday -- a deal other than dotting the i's and crossing the t's -- then it's time for me to look at other possible options.''</p>

        <p>Kevin Lowe was scheduled to meet again today with Cal Nichols, chairman of the 37-man group that owns the Edmonton Oilers. By tomorrow the Oilers should know whether Lowe, 41, will be their next general manager or leave the organization.</p>
        <p>The Oilers released a statement yesterday confirming that Lowe resigned as coach on Monday. ''We are now at a deadline,'' Lowe said yesterday by telephone. ''If we don't have some understanding by Thursday or Friday -- a deal other than dotting the i's and crossing the t's -- then it's time for me to look at other possible options.''</p>
        <p>The first of those options almost certainly involves becoming head coach of the Rangers, if Glen Sather, the team's new president and general manager, has his way. Sather, who resigned as Edmonton's president and general manager on May 19, had inserted an escape clause into Lowe's contract with the Oilers.</p>
