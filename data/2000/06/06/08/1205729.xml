        <p>Things are so desperate for the Dallas Stars right now that even Brett Hull is talking.</p>
        <p>Hull, who leads all playoff scorers this season with 11 goals and 23 points, sat in front of his locker stall here this morning at the Stars' practice facility, reflecting on the reasons why his team was one loss away from relinquishing the Stanley Cup to the Devils.</p>
        <p>Dallas trails the series by three games to one, and since the finals went to a four-of-seven game format in 1939, the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs are the only team to rally from a similar deficit and win the cup.</p>
        <p>Hull was asked why he had previously avoided the news media during the finals, allowing interviews only after he had scored two goals in the Stars' victory in Game 2.</p>
        <p>He replied, ''I don't have anything to say.</p>
        <p>''Listen to the questions,'' said Hull, who called them, at best, ''all rhetoric.''</p>
        <p>''You'll believe anything I say,'' he said. ''It's more time consuming than anything.</p>
        <p>''It's all propaganda. No one wants to say anything too controversial. It will only end up being put on the other team's bulletin board. All you do is get chastised for it.</p>
        <p>''Everybody wants to hear it, but then they call you a baby for speaking out. And more than three quarters of the players never back you up on it, even though privately they agree with you.''</p>
        <p>The 35-year-old right wing has long been known not only for his deadly release and pinpoint accuracy on the ice, but also for his penchant for verbosity most of the time off it. His teammate and good friend, Mike Keane, had a hat made that says, ''Shut Up, Hull!''</p>
        <p>''All year, he talks 24 hours a day about everything -- sticks, crossword puzzles,'' Keane said. ''It just saves me from having to tell him.''</p>
        <p>But at least in his dealings with the news media, Hull has taken Keane's hat to heart. Teammates like Derian Hatcher, Mike Modano, Guy Carbonneau and Keane have done the talking for him -- unless he scores a goal.</p>
        <p>''If you look at the team we have and the people we have on it, we have enough people to speak,'' Hull said today.</p>
        <p>Hull has been one of the few athletes willing to speak his mind on any subject imaginable. But since coming to Dallas, he has had to trade in his candor to fit into Coach Ken Hitchcock's faceless system of 12 interchangeable forwards and 6 interchangeable defensemen, full-court pressing, checking and trapping for 60 minutes a game.</p>
        <p>The trade-off has had its benefits. Last season, Hull won his first Stanley Cup -- and scored the controversial cup-winning goal, to boot.</p>
        <p>But it is obvious that he is not altogether comfortable in his low-key role, consecutive appearances in the finals or not.</p>
        <p>''The people that have been around the team for this season have seen a frustrated athlete,'' said Hitchcock, alluding to the career-low 24 goals Hull scored in the regular season. ''During the playoffs, he has made a determined effort to focus on his play and not on what he's said. He's done this to get away from the limelight.</p>
        <p>''He's cagey. He knows that if he talks too much, the other team is going to point at him. So he doesn't bring attention to himself on the ice. He's almost like a sandbagger in golf. The regular season was embarrassing to Hully. He's trying to make amends.''</p>
        <p>''He's been a lot different,'' Hitchcock said of Hull in the playoffs. ''He's been a lot more sincere, a lot less sarcastic. He still comes up with his one-liners every 30 seconds, but they've been different.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's the bitterness there was in the regular season.''</p>
        <p>Neither is there the outspokeness that the old Hull used to possess before he came the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''There's no old Bret Hull, so I'm not saying anything,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Do you miss him?</p>
        <p>''Yes I do,'' he said, almost wistfully. ''Very much. He was a lot of fun.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Dallas Coach KEN HITCHCOCK said GUY CARBONNEAU and JAMIE LANGENBRUNNER were both questionable for Thursday's Game 5. Each is hindered by a sore knee. . . . In an attempt at levity, MIKE KEANE hit MIKE MODANO in the face with a cake as practice was ending Wednesday in honor of Modano's 30th birthday.</p>
