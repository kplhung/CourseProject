        <p>When it comes to public sculpture, Jeff Koons's giant topiaryesque ''Puppy'' is a rarity, a guaranteed crowd-pleaser with serious art credentials. A 1992 work, it has been seen in Germany, Spain and Australia and is now stationed in front of 30 Rockefeller Center until Sept. 5. Irresistibly cute, 43 feet high and quilted with flowers, it occupies the spot traditionally reserved for New York's most famous Christmas tree and easily holds down this patch of unusually fetishized turf.</p>
        <p>''Puppy'' is identifiably a West Highland terrier sitting attentively on its haunches. When you walk around this canine, you almost expect to see a tail twitching quietly in anticipation of a reward or the next command.</p>

        <p>When it comes to public sculpture, Jeff Koons's giant topiaryesque ''Puppy'' is a rarity, a guaranteed crowd-pleaser with serious art credentials. A 1992 work, it has been seen in Germany, Spain and Australia and is now stationed in front of 30 Rockefeller Center until Sept. 5. Irresistibly cute, 43 feet high and quilted with flowers, it occupies the spot traditionally reserved for New York's most famous Christmas tree and easily holds down this patch of unusually fetishized turf.</p>
        <p>''Puppy'' is identifiably a West Highland terrier sitting attentively on its haunches. When you walk around this canine, you almost expect to see a tail twitching quietly in anticipation of a reward or the next command.</p>
        <p>Structurally speaking, ''Puppy'' is a hollow stainless-steel sculpture covered with foam into which thousands of annuals have been stuck, roots and all (marigolds, begonias and lobelias among them). A little door near the tail and an interior ladder facilitate watering. As the summer passes the work will become more lush, and the plant life, guided by the sculpture's surface, will look shaggier and shaggier, in a calico (noncat) sort of way.</p>
        <p>It seems safe to say that monumentality has never looked so endearing or tender. The scale and simplicity of the form fend off sentimentality, even as the zillions of flowers humanize the towering scale. As soon as the scaffolding came down on Monday afternoon, tourists started gathering on the eastern edge of the skating rink (currently an open-air restaurant), cameras in hand.</p>
        <p>The dog plus flowers plus bigness is a particularly innocent, joyful example of the transformation of familiar objects for which Mr. Koons is best known. His strategy has a long history; it descends from the Duchamp ready-made by way of Jasper Johns and Claes Oldenburg, whose painted flags and giant vinyl hamburgers were in essence remade ready-mades. Partly as a result of Mr. Koons's influence, this strategy has been embraced by myriad artists since the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koons's best remade ready-mades make the conversion to art especially accessible by mating almost ubiquitous objects with resonant materials. His goal doesn't seem to be to simply ''make it new,'' in the words of Ezra Pound, but to make it new, beautiful and oddly pure.</p>
        <p>In the beginning he simply enhanced actual objects, emerging in the early 1980's with a series tellingly titled ''The New'' that consisted of shiny new vacuum cleaners placed in immaculate, lighted vitrines, as if they were sacred relics.</p>
        <p>Since then he has veered between innocence and jadedness. His basketballs floating in fish aquariums took the notion of newness to almost womblike extremes. Other works seemed deliberately ironic, as when he translated objects of leisure into expensive materials that also rendered them useless. In this vein he has cast a Baccarat decanter in stainless steel and a diving lung and rubber dinghy in bronze. Somewhere in between, he also used cast stainless steel to breathe new life into both a kitschy bust of Louis XIV and a dime-store inflatable bunny.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koons's goals have always been his own and have repeatedly reflected a strong interest in communicating with a mass audience. Thus he has made larger-than-life porcelain sculptures of Michael Jackson with his pet monkey, and a polychrome wood piece, also quite large, based on a postcard of a London bobby commiserating with a bear.</p>
        <p>In 1989 he seemed to feel that this communication required total revelation, and innocence and jadedness met head-on. He exhibited big high-gloss photo-based paintings of him having carefully staged sex with his wife, the Italian porn star Ciccolina (they're now divorced), in idealized settings. These images were widely denounced at the time and probably helped ignite the current wave of art-about-sex and personal revelation, but they possessed a weird pre-Raphaelite pristineness.</p>
        <p>And even this series, titled ''Made in Heaven,'' included objects that communicated a simpler, more obvious kind of love: floral arrangements, a pair of putti and even a poodle, made (like the bobby and bear) in polychrome carved wood by skilled craftsmen in Germany.</p>
        <p>These works in particular were part of a line that leads directly to the puppy, which Mr. Koons has said he considers a ''spiritual work'' because it is intended to ''communicate happiness,'' pure and simple.</p>
        <p>It does. Mr. Koons, not known for his modesty, also once wrote, ''I've made what the Beatles would have made if they had made sculpture.'' The Rockefeller Center ''Puppy'' gives this statement the fullest credence it may ever have.</p>
