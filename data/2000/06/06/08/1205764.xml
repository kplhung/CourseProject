        <p>A young couple used mail pilfered from thousands of homes in Queens and Long Island neighborhoods to steal more than $1.5 million from banks and credit card companies, prosecutors said yesterday. They called the crime one of the most brazen and methodical cases of identity theft they had seen.</p>
        <p>The Queens district attorney, Richard A.

        <p>A young couple used mail pilfered from thousands of homes in Queens and Long Island neighborhoods to steal more than $1.5 million from banks and credit card companies, prosecutors said yesterday. They called the crime one of the most brazen and methodical cases of identity theft they had seen.</p>
        <p>The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said the couple, Ismael Irizarry, 28, and Luisa Irizarry, 27, hired 16 people to plunder mailboxes in affluent and middle-class neighborhoods like Forest Hills and Bayside in Queens, as well as communities in both Nassau and Suffolk Counties.</p>
        <p>Their victims included ''many prominent names in the New York metropolitan area,'' including political and civic leaders, Mr. Brown said. But he refused to name any of them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Irizarry, who was indicted in November, was arrested in January,  but his wife remained at large until she was arrested in Florida last Friday.</p>
        <p>For more than 18 months, starting in 1998, Mr. Brown said, the couple and their assistants combed through hundreds of thousands of pieces of mail to steal credit card applications, checks and personal information like Social Security numbers and drivers' license numbers.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said that the Irizarrys, who formerly lived in Queens, set up a computer database of all the information and applied for credit cards and cashed stolen  checks. Some of those checks were deposited in the bank accounts of two fictitious corporations, Millennium Import/Export Company and Genesis Communications, officials said. Under the names of those companies, they said, the couple opened at least 20 accounts at different banks.</p>
        <p>The Irizarrys were indicted on charges of grand larceny, possessing forged checks, falsifying business records, scheming to defraud and possessing stolen property, according to court records. A conviction on grand larceny, the most serious charge, could lead to up to 15 years in prison.</p>
        <p>Mr. Irizarry's lawyer, Salvatore Chetta of Queens, could not be reached for comment. Lawyers at the public defender's office in Dade County, Fla., who are representing Ms. Irizarry did not return calls seeking comment about the case.</p>
        <p>Investigators from the Queens district attorney's office and the United States Postal Inspection Service found a list of 2,000 names of victims in the computer database, Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>''The ease with which these people take over the identity of credit card holders, the ease with which they rip off banks and credit card companies,  and create financial havoc for the victims is unbelievable,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In one case, Mr. Brown said, a victim who had cashed about $119,000 worth of bonds at the Bank of New York was due to receive a check for that amount. But the Irizarrys intercepted the check and cashed it, Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>Identity theft crimes involving the postal system have been increasing rapidly over the past several years. Last year, postal investigators made more than 500 arrests. The number has been doubling each year since 1996, when only 53 arrests were made.</p>
        <p>''These people had been at it  awhile,'' said Pat Casey, a spokesman for the postal inspection agency. ''A lot of ingenuity went into this. It was quite an elaborate system.''</p>
        <p>The case began in 1998 with investigations into several complaints of credit card fraud and mail theft. Eventually, investigators linked a large number of garbage bags filled with discarded mail found in Kissena Park in Flushing to that fraud. Two of the couple's 16 runners -- who prosecutors said were paid $300 to $600 per day depending on what they found in mailboxes -- were arrested on the basis of that discovery and charged with petty larceny.</p>
        <p>In December, the Irizarrys moved  to Pembroke Pines, Fla. Mr. Irizarry was arrested in January on a visit to New York. He is being held without bail.</p>
        <p>His wife remained at large until Friday, when she was arrested by Florida police officers after she tried to lease cars using stolen checks under the alias of Gloria Casanove, Mr. Brown said. She was charged by the Miami police with auto theft and assaulting a police officer, and is awaiting extradition to New York, Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown added that she also faced outstanding warrants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania for unspecified crimes.</p>
        <p>''These rings are becoming more and more sophisticated,'' Mr. Brown said. ''They won't limit themselves to credit card fraud. They will expand into other enterprises.''</p>
