        <p>I IMAGINE that some shoppers react sympathetically when a store goes out of business. My mother, for instance, still feels guilty about Bonwit Teller and wonders if her decision not to buy a certain red wool coat there one winter somehow contributed to the department store's demise. I agree it was a mistake to pass up the coat, because it looked so good with her hair.</p>
        <p>But that is the extent of my remorse. When a store goes out of business, I drop everything and rush out to the liquidation sale.</p>
        <p>I imagine that other people would consider this behavior unseemly. My mother, for instance, has been heard to refer to the elbowing shoppers who surround the ''final sale'' pillowcases as ''vultures.'' I prefer the more neutral, and I believe more accurate, label: foragers.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the recent flurry of high-profile online retailers who have gone out of business -- like the toy seller Redrocket.com and the arts and crafts supplier Craftshop.com -- shoppers like me have a new place to graze.</p>
        <p>''An awful lot of online businesses are going out of business faster than offline stores,'' said Bill Blundon, executive vice president of Extraprise, a consulting firm in Boston, ''because when their initial funding dries up, venture capital firms will not be as willing to step in to fill the void.''</p>
        <p>So after reading about the financial travails that forced the trendy online apparel company Boo.com into liquidation last month, I wondered if I might find some online bargains. Last week I went to visit.</p>
        <p>At Boo.com I found all the glitzy trappings that stopped me from shopping at the site in the first place: the annoying flashing screens and confusing graphics that made it difficult to shop, a gimmicky feature that let shoppers ''try on'' items and even the site's too-perky mascot, Miss Boo, an animated personal shopper.</p>
        <p>But one thing was missing: evidence that the site was going out of business. No sale merchandise. No invitations to the crowds flying overhead in circles -- I mean, foraging -- for the last marked-down designer backpack. Instead, the merchandise -- from the DKNY sweat pants to the Converse sneakers to the Helly Hensen active wear -- were marked full price, but I was so confused that I filled a shopping cart anyway. Only when I tried to check out with a pair of black running shorts that cost $42 and a $20 T-shirt did I get a clue that things were not right. ''An error has occurred with your session, please try again,'' the site informed me.</p>
        <p>After a few more failures, I realized this was Boo.com's understated way of saying the store was closed. I called the liquidators at KPMG in London to find out and learned that Boo.com had stopped taking orders a week earlier. ''An offline store would post a sign or something,'' I complained. ''Otherwise, how are people supposed to know?''</p>
        <p>KPMG's Mick McLoughlin said he would be surprised if anyone didn't know. ''This has probably been the best publicized insolvency in some time,'' Mr. McLoughlin said. In other words, stop looking at the fashion advertisements and start reading the financial pages. When traditional stores go out of business, they have inventory to get rid of before they lock the doors. For online retailers, who have little or no inventory, the old rules do not apply. And what if a shopper managed to miss the news that Boo.com was in trouble and was among the last to place an order?</p>
        <p>In troubled stores, online shoppers will face a new risk. ''The old risk was: If you've never heard of them, how do you know those guys aren't crooks?'' said Erik Gordon, director of the University of Florida's Center for Retailing. ''Now the new risk is, I know they're not crooks, but how do I know they're not going out of business tomorrow, and if they do, will I get my money back?''</p>
        <p>In a real store, the transaction is a simultaneous exchange: you hand over the payment and immediately receive the merchandise. ''You would feel a little differently if you had to hand over $20 to a store that was going out of business and then come back a week later for the shirt,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''On the Internet, that's what you're doing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McLoughlin said that in the case of Boo.com, shoppers would probably be safe. ''I'm almost sure there will be some unfulfilled orders,'' he said, ''but I don't know the details. But their credit cards would not be debited before the purchase shipped. Although it's inconvenient, they shouldn't lose money.''</p>
        <p>Where does that leave online stores that are still operating but about which you may have had a whiff of negative financial information? The music site CDNow, for example, has been selling CD's at bargain prices, but the company, which is short of cash, is looking for a new partner or investor. Should you shop there?</p>
        <p>''We're not going out of business, and it's safe to shop here,'' said Debbie Vondran, a CDNow spokeswoman. ''You can see that we have been constantly growing the site, adding features and functionalities, new promotions and new content. That's an indication that we have a pretty solid business.''</p>
        <p>Putting aside for a moment the fact that Ms. Vondran is an interested party, she does make a good point. When you visit an unfamiliar online retailer, the first thing you should do is scrutinize the site for robust, customer-friendly features. A healthy site should prominently display a toll-free customer service number, a clear return policy and an assurance that your credit card will not be charged until after your items are shipped.</p>
        <p>And look for hints of trouble. For weeks before Boo.com announced its difficulties, for instance, the retailer suddenly started sending prospective customers coupons offering 30 percent off merchandise.</p>
        <p>Late last week, Fashionmall.com acquired Boo.com. When I visited again, the old Boo.com site was gone, replaced by an invitation to join an e-mail list to learn about the reopening of Boo.</p>
        <p>I imagine some shoppers might have been leery, but I signed up. If there is a Grand Opening sale, I will rush over to forage.</p>
