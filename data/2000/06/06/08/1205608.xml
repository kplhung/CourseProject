        <p>Cross new design and stylish Parisians and what do you get? George, the latest restaurant opened by the Costes (pronounced coast) brothers, Jean-Louis and Gilbert. With seven places, they are building a see-and-be-seen empire in Paris. In a sure sign they've caught on, CD's of their D.J.'s ambient music are definite must-haves.</p>
        <p>George, an airy loftlike space at the top of the newly renovated Centre Pompidou, reigns as the current Costes hot spot by mixing equal parts exciting design and location, location, location. Designed by the architects Jakob &amp; MacFarlane, the restaurant is dotted with massive tubular brushed aluminum grottoes (top) that punctuate the minimalist decor. One grotto (below) is a private dining space. With its modular plastic chairs and tables lighted from below, George is at the other end of the spectrum from the plush, rich bordello look of the Hotel Costes, designed by Jacques Garcia, the brothers' first big success.</p>

        <p>For added glamour, at night you can ascend the museum's five flights of escalators only if your name is on the reservations list.</p>
        <p>Among its other offerings are views over Paris as far as the eye can see, terrace dining in the summer and stylish waiters (they look more like bodyguards or secret agents in their black suits and ties). The dressed up and the fashionably dressed down seem to follow the Costes wherever they go. Reservations: 011-33-1-44-78-47-99.</p>
