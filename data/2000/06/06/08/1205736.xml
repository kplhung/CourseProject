        <p>AT&amp;T gave into pressure from embarrassed federal regulators and outraged consumer groups today and said that it would put off a planned rate increase that would have raised telephone bills for tens of millions of customers.</p>
        <p>The announcement came after a flurry of calls between senior AT&amp;T executives and the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, William E. Kennard, who said that the company, the nation's largest long-distance provider, had broken a promise to reduce overall phone charges under an agreement reached last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard and AT&amp;T had promoted that agreement, under which the F.C.C. reduced the fees paid by long-distance carriers to local phone companies, as a ''historic'' rate cut. But at the same time, AT&amp;T filed documents with the commission that said the company would actually be raising most of the per-minute charges on the basic accounts of millions of customers who make few calls.</p>
        <p>''AT&amp;T promised to pass on savings to all consumers,'' Mr. Kennard said in a statement issued after his conversations with AT&amp;T executives, including its chairman, C. Michael Armstrong. ''Their new rate plan does not do that.''</p>
        <p>''It is in our order and I am going to enforce it,'' he said. ''AT&amp;T promised to tell their consumers which plan would be most cost-effective for them. This was not done. I will also hold AT&amp;T to this commitment.''</p>
        <p>Gloria Tristani, another F.C.C. commissioner, issued a blistering six-word statement. ''I was totally misled by AT&amp;T,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Their statements were curious in light of comments on Tuesday from other officials at the commission who said that they knew all along that AT&amp;T had intended to raise certain rates and that they were not particularly troubled by the knowledge because the company had agreed to send a letter to customers informing them of lower-cost plans.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T, which handles 60 percent of the nation's residential long-distance calls, said it had decided to defer the rate increases in light of the F.C.C.'s concerns. ''Given the reaction on the part of some, we want to go back and make sure we're delivering the benefits we thought we were,'' said James Cicconi, AT&amp;T's general counsel. ''We expect to move as quickly as we can.'' Other AT&amp;T executives said that they expected a decision on the rate increase within the next few weeks.</p>
        <p>Officials said the F.C.C. complaints to AT&amp;T were prompted by a report today in The New York Times about the rate increases.</p>
        <p>The new basic plan, which is intended for people who make few long-distance calls, would have eliminated a $3 monthly minimum for long-distance service but would have increased per-minute charges every day except Sunday, the only day when rates would come down. The biggest increase would have taken place on Saturday, when rates would have jumped by 163 percent, to 29 cents from 11 cents.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T's announcement came today after officials at the F.C.C. threatened to take steps to reject the rate increases. Ordinarily, the agency has limited authority to force telephone companies to reduce their rates. But under the agreement announced last week between the agency and most of the major phone companies, the F.C.C. may impose ''fines, forfeitures or the rejection of any nonconforming rates.''</p>
        <p>Neither AT&amp;T nor the F.C.C. publicized the rate increases last week when they said that bills for millions of customers would drop as the company passed on savings from a government-ordered reduction in the fees that long-distance companies pay to local phone companies.</p>
        <p>In their announcement last week, the agency and AT&amp;T also said that subscribers to the basic service would benefit from the elimination of theaminimum monthly $3 fee. But the announcement never mentioned that the per-minute rates would be increased Monday through Saturday.</p>
        <p>While the plan announced last week would reduce bills by as much as 50 percent for a consumer who made no long-distance calls, it would increase rates for those on the basic plan who made more than 12 minutes of calls and followed the national pattern for calls, according to an analysis by the Consumer Federation of America.</p>
        <p>A customer who, for instance, decided one month to make 45 minutes worth of long-distance calls on Saturdays under the old plan would pay $4.95 plus taxes and special fees. Under the plan filed last week, that same customer would pay $13.05 plus taxes and fees. And under a 19-cents-a-minute plan that the company will be promoting, that customer would pay $8.55.</p>
        <p>Consumer groups and Wall Street analysts said today that they did not blame AT&amp;T for what some said was, in effect, a pricing shell game of reducing rates in some areas and increasing them in others. But they criticized the F.C.C. for both being misleading and for failing to prevent rates from increasing.</p>
        <p>One analyst, Scott Cleland of Legg Mason Precursor Group, who had praised the F.C.C. for putting forward a rate plan that eliminated some hidden subsidies from bills, today compared officials there to a scene in the Peanuts comic strip.</p>
        <p>''They're like Lucy and the football,'' he said..</p>
        <p>Gene Kimmelman, the co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union, said the day's developments had demonstrated that the F.C.C. had failed to negotiate a rate plan that it could properly monitor.</p>
        <p>''The decision announced by AT&amp;T today is not a bad deal,'' he said. ''It is fine for today, but what about tomorrow, next week and next month when you don't have the outrage that was clearly felt today by the company.''</p>
        <p>WorldCom and Sprint, the nation's second-  and third-largest long-distance companies, will also benefit from last week's agreement cutting the fees they pay to local phone companies to connect customers' calls.</p>
        <p>But unlike AT&amp;T, neither has filed a rate increase for basic service in recent days.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T executives said that today's announcement would not affect its plan to increase charges on some One Rate plans, in which customers pay a flat fee on top of a set per-minute charge. The flat fee on those plans will increase by 66 percent, to $5 a month from $3.</p>
        <p>The executives said that they had proposed the new basic rates presuming that many customers would shift making long-distance calls to Sunday to save money. The proposed plan would have reduced Sunday calling rates on the basic plan to 7 cents a minute from 11 cents.</p>
        <p>But only about 20 percent of all residential calls are placed on Sunday, and the filing last week with the F.C.C. raised rates for the other six days.</p>
        <p>Under the old basic plan, customers paid 11 cents a minute for Saturday long-distance calls. For calls made on Monday to Friday during the peak hours of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., the basic rate was 26 cents a minute. For off-peak hours, long-distance calls cost 16 cents a minute.</p>
