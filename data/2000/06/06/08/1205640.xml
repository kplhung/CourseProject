        <p>Martin Arnold column on generation gap that appears to be growing between book-buying public and three titans of American fiction: Saul Bellow, Philip Roth and John Updike, whose latest novels did not sell nearly so well as their critical acclaim and splashy launchings suggested they would; Bellow's Ravelstein and Updike's Gertrude and Claudius did not approach best-seller numbers, and Roth's The Human Stain made New York Times's best-seller list for only a week; photos (M)</p>

        <p>This year has been, in a sense, an abounding one for great American writing.

        <p>This year has been, in a sense, an abounding one for great American writing. It has brought us novels by three of America's leading literary icons: the Nobel laureate Saul Bellow and two potential Nobel Prize winners, Philip Roth and John Updike. Yet notwithstanding generally strong reviews and tremendous coverage of the daring literary conceits of the works, only one made The New York Times's best-seller list, and that for but a week.</p>
        <p>Each author had everything going for him, and the publication of each novel was treated as a cultural event by the newspapers, magazines, national public radio stations and on-line magazines that dote on them.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Updike's ''Gertrude and Claudius'' (Knopf), a sort of prequel to ''Hamlet,'' did not approach best-seller numbers, despite interesting word-of-mouth; Mr. Bellow's ''Ravelstein'' (Viking) made the list for one week; Mr. Roth's ''Human Stain'' (Houghton Mifflin) lingered a notch below the list before dropping, despite exceptional publicity, including a long profile of the author in The New Yorker by the magazine's editor, David Remnick.</p>
        <p>Why was there such a harrowing disconnect between the critical acclaim and the literary chatter, on the one hand, and the book-buying public on the other? The easy answer is that a list that includes three Harry Potter novels, one Dr. Seuss and several ballyhooed by the Oprah Winfrey book club is indeed a tough one for a literary novel to crack.</p>
        <p>But even in that quirky universe, literary fiction can make it. Michael Ondaatje's ''Anil's Ghost'' (Knopf) will be No. 12 on June 18. Other recent literary best sellers included ''Horse Heaven'' (Knopf) by Jane Smiley and ''Plainsong'' (Knopf) by Kent Haruf. (Toni Morrison's ''Bluest Eye'' (Knopf) and Isabel Allende's ''Daughters of Fortune'' (HarperCollins), both literary fiction, were best sellers that were Oprah Winfrey book club selections.)</p>
        <p>That Messrs. Bellows, Roth and Updike have come up so short has stimulated some theories and stirred some speculation in book publishing. It should be noted that no one in publishing is questioning their viability as writers or their ability to hold onto their fans or even gain new converts.  But clearly something has changed, besides the impact of book clubs and the fact that chain stores are less apt to push literary fiction than are the shrinking number of independent book stores.</p>
        <p>Many in publishing believe that a generation gap has grown between the mass of book buyers and these three legends that even bravura reviews cannot easily leap. James Silberman, an independent editor who works mostly with Knopf and Harcourt Brace, said: ''In every generation the icons get eclipsed by the fashionable and literary styles change, the tone of voice changes and certainly commercial styles change, and the type of relationships they write about are different.</p>
        <p>''These three are in a sense realistic novelists, and to some degree they write only about the world they know well,'' he said. ''Today there are the great explosion novels that are popular and also the endless exquisite single relationship novels.''</p>
        <p>Certainly the relationships that Mr. Bellows, Mr. Roth and Mr. Updike write about are in many ways almost murderous in the way they are torn apart, but to many younger readers they may seem somewhat remote. Murder today means murder.</p>
        <p>Roger Straus, president and chief executive of Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, linked the books' sales performance to ''the aging process.''</p>
        <p>''They're all getting old, and critics and the public look for something really delicious, groundbreaking,'' he said. ''By the 34th novel, the fourth sequel, they say, 'So what.' ''</p>
        <p>Moreover since these three great writers erupted on the literary scene, the old issues of Jewish assimilation in American society often at the core of Mr. Bellow's and Mr. Roth's novels have been settled. Three different publishers mentioned that cultural change that has robbed Mr. Bellow's and Mr. Roth's writing of urgency for the current generation of book buyers. (Mr. Bellow and Mr. Updike did not return calls for this column. Mr. Roth declined, through his publisher.)</p>
        <p>So if their books are not selling in great numbers right now, they are in libraries and on college syllabuses. Mr. Updike and Mr. Bellows have been publishing novels for nearly half a century; Mr. Roth since the 1960's. What makes them icons is that they have withstood the flashes of the current literary moment, whenever that moment was, continuing to write and sell books through several generations of writers, most of whom have been erased from memory and bookshelves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silberman noted: '' 'Moby-Dick' was a commercial failure, after Melville had written commercially successful books. His reputation was in eclipse for a long time. He's certainly back now. When you read him you know why.''</p>
        <p>While great commercial success may have eluded them this time, there are a lot of doctorates in literature to be earned this century on these latest novels and on the backlists of Messrs. Bellow, Updike and Roth.</p>
        <p>MAKING BOOKS  Correction:  June 9, 2000, Friday  A picture caption with the Making Books column yesterday, about leading authors and the sales shortfall of their recent novels, misidentified the work that made a one-week appearance on the New York Times best-seller list. As the article noted, it was ''Ravelstein,'' by Saul Bellow, not ''The Human Stain'' by Philip Roth.</p>
