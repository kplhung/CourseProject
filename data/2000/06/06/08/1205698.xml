        <p>''Possession of unchallenged economic power deadens initiative, discourages thrift and depresses energy.''</p>
        <p>''Immunity from competition is a narcotic, and rivalry a stimulant, to industrial progress.''</p>
        <p>Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in June 2000 ordering the breakup of Microsoft? No, Judge Learned Hand declaring in 1945 that the Aluminum Company of America had illegally monopolized the market for a type of aluminum ingot.</p>
        <p>A lot has changed since 1945, the exact midpoint between the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 and the Microsoft ruling today.</p>
        <p>An economy based on heavy industry and capital investment has transformed itself into one based more and more on human capital and information technology where ''it's pretty hard to figure out what the markets are and what really competes with what,'' as Thomas E. Kauper, a former government antitrust chief who now teaches antitrust law at the University of Michigan, noted today.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, as today's ruling demonstrates, the old factories may be obsolete, but the legal principles that led to the breakup of the Standard Oil trust in 1911 and the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company in 1984 are not.</p>
        <p>Perceptions and priorities have changed, naturally enough. When oil and tobacco trusts loomed over the economic landscape, the perceived enemy was price-fixing, while in the government's theory of Microsoft, adopted by Judge Jackson, the enemy is the ability of a predatory monopolist to strangle innovation.</p>
        <p>But from a broader perspective, these are just different ways to measure a monopolist's threat to consumers, the protection of whom was the ultimate goal of antitrust enforcement in the old economy and remains so in the new. There is no reason the old rules should not apply in the software-driven economy, Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general for antitrust, has insisted throughout the case.</p>
        <p>Simply attaining monopoly status in a given market, by being quicker out of the starting gate, or more creative or diligent than the competition, does not itself violate antitrust law. As Judge Hand said in the Alcoa case, ''The successful competitor, having been urged to compete, must not be turned upon when he wins.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft, portraying itself as a victim of antitrust policy run amok, has long argued that the government was turning on it in exactly that way. Judge Jackson disagreed. Microsoft's offense, he held, lay not in the fact that its Windows operating system runs 90 percent of the world's personal computers, but in the methods the company used to maintain and try to extend its monopoly.</p>
        <p>''Judge Jackson found that Microsoft mounted a campaign of dirty tricks, and the dirty tricks are old tricks,'' said Robert E. Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution who served in the Justice Department's antitrust division earlier in the Clinton administration. In an interview, he continued: ''John D. Rockefeller used them all: exclusive contracting, throwing your weight around, scaring off the competition.''</p>
        <p>Antitrust cases have two dimensions: liability and, if liability is found, a remedy. While on the liability side, there is a straight line leading from the earliest antitrust cases to today's ruling, Judge Jackson's approved remedy -- breaking Microsoft in two -- arguably moves the case toward uncharted territory.</p>
        <p>Monopolies have been broken up before, of course, either by court order, as in the Standard Oil case, or by negotiated settlement, as with AT&amp;T. But the earlier breakups were along fairly obvious lines.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T's own corporate structure reflected the division between long-distance service, which it kept in the breakup, and local telephone service, which was spun off. Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, repeated today, as he has in the past, that there was no precedent for breaking up a ''unitary'' company such as his.</p>
        <p>To assess the wisdom of the remedy in the Microsoft case, which the government sought and which Microsoft strenuously resisted, requires a set of subtle judgments and just plain guesses about the environment for Internet-based information and a technology market that even during the two years of the Microsoft trial has evolved with surprising speed away from the desktop and toward wireless hand-held devices.</p>
        <p>It also involves, to a degree that no other antitrust case has, questions about maintaining the country's leadership in the global economy. Of all the earlier antitrust cases, only the AT&amp;T case came close to having such global implications. ''If we had left AT&amp;T where it was, we'd have a stodgy, nondynamic telecommunications world today, and we'd never even know what we were missing,'' said Harvey J. Goldschmid, an antitrust professor at Columbia Law School, in an interview.</p>
        <p>Nearly 20 years further into the information revolution, the implications of a wrong bet on the Microsoft remedy are even greater, given the dominance that Microsoft's success has meant for the United States. While the government's economic experts have dismissed the warnings of Mr. Gates, that efficiency and synergy will be lost by cleaving the Windows operating system from the software applications, the fact is nobody knows for sure.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Charles D. Weller, an antitrust specialist at the Cleveland law firm of Baker &amp; Hostetler, commented today that under the Supreme Court's current skeptical view of expert testimony -- a view the justices have applied in negligence cases but not yet directly to antitrust cases -- the economists who testified on both sides should have been disqualified.</p>
        <p>Breaking up Microsoft ''is not like breaking up two factories,'' Professor Goldschmid said. ''A breakup may well be the appropriate remedy,'' he said, ''but the tough part is that there is a heavy investment in human capital, and breaking up Microsoft means changing things for a lot of people.''</p>
