        <p>Seeking to convince jurors that Albert J. Pirro Jr. deliberately tried to evade taxes, an agent for the Internal Revenue Service said today that Mr. Pirro's corporate accounts were overdrawn by up to $37,500 to pay for personal items, even though he had access to thousands of dollars in his personal account.</p>
        <p>The agent, John Dennehy, first described Mr. Pirro's spending on paintings, furniture, antiques and a private investigator. Then, Mr. Dennehy discussed how some of these items would be classified as nondeductible ''miscellaneous'' expenses on Mr. Pirro's books, yet wind up in tax-deductible categories like ''repairs and maintenance'' on Mr. Pirro's corporate tax returns.</p>

        <p>Seeking to convince jurors that Albert J. Pirro Jr. deliberately tried to evade taxes, an agent for the Internal Revenue Service said today that Mr. Pirro's corporate accounts were overdrawn by up to $37,500 to pay for personal items, even though he had access to thousands of dollars in his personal account.</p>
        <p>The agent, John Dennehy, first described Mr. Pirro's spending on paintings, furniture, antiques and a private investigator. Then, Mr. Dennehy discussed how some of these items would be classified as nondeductible ''miscellaneous'' expenses on Mr. Pirro's books, yet wind up in tax-deductible categories like ''repairs and maintenance'' on Mr. Pirro's corporate tax returns.</p>
        <p>So it went on Day 12 of testimony in the federal tax-fraud trial against Mr. Pirro, the husband of Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, and his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro.</p>
        <p>For the last three days, Mr. Dennehy has been the government's central witness in its case against the brothers, who are accused of improperly deducting more than $1.2 million of Albert Pirro's personal expenses as business write-offs between 1988 and 1997.</p>
        <p>But on cross-examination, one of Albert Pirro's lawyers, Robert J. Giuffra Jr., forced Mr. Dennehy to acknowledge that the government's key exhibit summarizing Mr. Pirro's tax situation contained a dozen or so errors. And the point was underscored by the fact that the mistakes were made despite the best efforts, over a two-year period, of Mr. Dennehy, a half-dozen or so I.R.S. agents and several members of the United States attorney's office.</p>
        <p>It was not clear whether those errors actually undermined Mr. Dennehy's calculations of Mr. Pirro's tax returns, or whether they simply amounted to sloppy clerical work. But with Mr. Dennehy set to take the stand again on Thursday, Mr. Pirro's lawyers are evidently trying to persuade the jury that if the government is not infallible in preparing tax-related documents, then neither is Mr. Pirro, who has been portrayed as an extremely busy businessman and Republican lobbyist.</p>
        <p>But today was still the prosecution's half of the inning, spearheaded by Cathy Seibel, an assistant United States attorney.</p>
        <p>There was much more focus, for one thing, on Anthony Pirro, whose accounting practice typically relied on Albert's numerous businesses to provide one-third of his annual receipts. Several times, Mr. Dennehy read aloud from memorandums prepared by Anthony, and addressed to Albert, that discussed how Albert could reduce his tax liability from his various business entities.</p>
        <p>In addition, Anthony Pirro's worksheets showed an extra $30,000 in subcontracting expenses, plus an extra $23,455 in interest expenses, even though Mr. Dennehy said that he could not find any documents to substantiate those claims. And once, someone -- though it was not clear who -- changed a handwritten ''2'' on one of Anthony Pirro's worksheets to a ''4,'' resulting in an increase of $20,000 to Albert Pirro's tax deductions in 1994.</p>
        <p>There was also more talk about Jeanine Pirro. She has not been charged with wrongdoing, but prosecutors have not portrayed her as an innocent party. Today, Mr. Dennehy talked at some length about several Republican consultants who helped Mrs. Pirro's 1993 campaign for district attorney, suggesting that the campaign had planned to pay those consultants, only to be usurped, in one instance, by one of Mr. Pirro's companies. And he read aloud from Albert Pirro's appointment book from the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>''Tony Pirro and JFP reviewing taxes at the house,'' read one entry, referring to Mrs. Pirro's initials. ''Tony Pirro at home to go over taxes with AJP and JFP,'' read another.</p>
