        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was encouraged to read Maureen Dowd's description of my job in her June 7 column, ''Rescue Me, Please!'' I have enjoyed being at home taking care of my children for the last 17 years, but I haven't yet managed to meet, let alone be, the housewife she describes as spending the day eating shrimp, sleeping and chilling the cocktail shaker.</p>

        <p>Does she think there is still hope? I so long to have a nap.</p>
