      <abstract>
        <p>Corrections of June 6 article: Stanley Hill was formerly executive director, not president, of District Council 37; Local 1930, whose president commented on sentencing of head of affiliated union, represents 1,800, not 18,000, librarians and clerical workers</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on Tuesday about the sentencing of a former union president who pleaded guilty to stealing more than $2 million misstated the title once held by Stanley Hill at the union's parent, District Council 37, which is being investigated by Manhattan prosecutors. Mr. Hill was executive director, not president.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the membership of an affiliated union, Local 1930, whose president found the corruption sentence of three to nine years too lenient. The local represents 1,800 librarians and clerical workers, not 18,000.</p>
