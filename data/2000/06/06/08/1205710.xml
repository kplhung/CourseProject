        <p>Roy Romer is no stranger to politics. As governor of Colorado for 12 years, and then general chairman of the Democratic National Committee for two years, he has seen his share of infighting, bureaucracy and blood feuds.</p>
        <p>But perhaps nothing could prepare Mr. Romer, 71, for his latest assignment, as superintendent of the sprawling Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second largest, with 711,000 students, a budget nearly two-thirds the size of Colorado's and a list of problems that would stretch from here to Denver: lagging test scores, severe overcrowding, dilapidated buildings and a rapidly growing population of new immigrant children who speak every language but English.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the toughest jobs a guy could find,'' Mr. Romer, virtually the only candidate to seek a job that few wanted, said after his appointment was hastily announced on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Though his appointment was unanimous, at least two of the seven members of the school board said they had voted for him with some reluctance after a search conducted largely in private and after several other candidates, including the school board's favorite, former Secretary of Housing Henry G. Cisneros, either turned down the job or expressed little interest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romer had the support of influential business leaders, including Eli Broad, the billionaire executive and philanthropist, who suggested that he apply. He has a longstanding interest in education policy and was active in national efforts to improve public education by imposing rigorous standards and goals.</p>
        <p>But he has never lived in Los Angeles or run a school system, and is little known among the city's diverse communities, including Hispanics, who make up 70 percent of the district's student body.</p>
        <p>''A Bad Fit for the L.A.U.S.D.'' is how The Los Angeles Times greeted Mr. Romer's appointment in its lead editorial this morning, saying it was ''like choosing a spouse based on which suitor is most eager; it doesn't make the strongest basis for a long-term relationship.''</p>
        <p>The board was rushing to meet the self-imposed July 1 deadline for the departure of its interim superintendent, Ramon C. Cortines, who took on the job last fall after the ouster of the former superintendent, Ruben Zacarias.</p>
        <p>''I think the tragedy is that he was deprived of any opportunity through the selection process to learn more about Los Angeles and for Los Angeles to learn more about him,'' said Thomas A. Saenz, regional counsel of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which has filed various lawsuits alleging inadequacies in the California public schools. ''It's not his fault; it's something they've done to him, and we're obviously hopeful that he will be a person who seeks to reach out to the community and incorporate its ideas.''</p>
        <p>In a brief telephone interview today as he headed to Sacramento to testify before the State Board of Education, Mr. Romer insisted that his first priority would be to introduce himself. He said he had been looking for ways to start a national policy discussion on education and decided there was no better approach than to practice what he had been preaching.</p>
        <p>''Quite frankly,'' he said, ''it was a crisis of conscience. I said, 'Romer, do you want to start a think tank or do you want to go on the street and walk your talk.' This is the last job I intend to take, so I am very free. I don't have any agenda that I'm working on. I can come into this job and really call it as I see it. I recognize it's a tougher job than I had as governor, and will take more time and energy, but I thought this was the most important thing I could do.''</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Romer's first tasks will be to help Mr. Cortines select superintendents for 11 new semiautonomous subdistricts, which the board agreed to create in an effort to head off demands for breaking up the district altogether. The reorganization is to take effect the first of next month, the same week Mr. Romer takes over.</p>
        <p>''He has worked with unions; he is very fluent in educational issues,'' said Day Higuchi, president of the United Teachers of Los Angeles union, which is in the middle of contract talks. ''I think maybe the time is right to try going out of the box a little. L.A. Unified has more students than the smallest 29 states put together. So having a governorship may not be bad qualifications.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Romer, an intense, energetic man, was forced out of office by term limits in 1998, and friends say he seemed a bit bored being out of harness.</p>
        <p>President Clinton named him to head the Democratic National Committee in 1997, when the party organization was tangled in fund-raising controversies from the 1996 campaign. In 1998, Mr. Romer saw his reputation tarnished by his acknowledgment of a 16-year ''very affectionate relationship'' with a former female aide, and he stepped down as party chairman last year to concentrate on planning the Democratic convention in Los Angeles this summer.</p>
        <p>As governor, Mr. Romer led the development of early childhood education programs, created a centralized child-care referral system and intervened to halt a Denver teachers strike in 1991. In the early 1990's, he was co-chairman of the National Council on Educational Standards and Testing, an advisory group that recommended national curriculum standards.</p>
        <p>Now, said Caprice Young, one of the school board members, ''the real challenge and the real test is whether he can take us from policy through implementation, and that is not easy in a school district the size and complexity of L.A. Unified.''</p>
        <p>''I think on balance, the board believes that he can get there,'' Ms. Young said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cisneros, who is now president of Univision, the Spanish-language television network, turned down the superintendent's job for family reasons, but urged Mr. Romer to pursue it.</p>
        <p>''This is an incredibly diverse school district and city, and requires a great deal of understanding of the different roles that parents play in different cultures and about how education works,'' Mr. Cisneros said. ''Governor Romer has some experience in Colorado, but generally that's a much more homogenous state. It is a challenge which he is up to. He's a wonderfully wise man.''</p>
