        <p>In response to an inquiry into possible breaches in the independence of corporate auditors, the Big Five accounting firms have agreed to open up the investment portfolios of their partners and top managers to the Securities and Exchange Commission in exchange for immunity from enforcement, the S.E.C. said yesterday.</p>

        <p>In response to an inquiry into possible breaches in the independence of corporate auditors, the Big Five accounting firms have agreed to open up the investment portfolios of their partners and top managers to the Securities and Exchange Commission in exchange for immunity from enforcement, the S.E.C. said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The ''look-back program'' will review investments held by certain managers and partners for a period of at least nine months before March 31 to determine whether those employees held stock in companies they were auditing.</p>
        <p>''This is a significant chapter in the commission's and the profession's efforts to reinforce the importance of auditor independence,'' Arthur Levitt, the S.E.C. chairman, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The Big Five -- PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Arthur Andersen, Ernst &amp; Young and KPMG -- agreed to hire independent counsel to conduct a review and to report violations to the commission. In return, the firms will not be subject to enforcement except for the most serious violations, as when a firm or its senior employees working on an audit own stock in a client.</p>
        <p>The announcement comes a few weeks after Mr. Levitt, in a speech at New York University law school, criticized the accounting industry for cutting off financing for a public oversight board that delves into such conflicts of interests.</p>
        <p>The roots of the issue date back about 20 years, when accounting firms branched into consulting, according to Geoffrey Pickard, a spokesman of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which represents the nation's largest accounting firms.</p>
        <p>Public confidence in the independence of auditors has suffered as well, Mr. Pickard said. Most firms, including PricewaterhouseCoopers, are in the process of spinning off their consulting businesses, he said.</p>
        <p>In January, the S.E.C. found that partners and employees at PricewaterhouseCoopers had routinely violated rules forbidding their ownership of stock in companies they were auditing. The investigation uncovered 8,064 violations at the firm, which then dismissed five partners.</p>
        <p>PricewaterhouseCoopers said in a statement yesterday, ''Extending the independence compliance review program to the other firms is a good next step toward erasing any concerns that auditor independence has been eroded.''</p>
