        <p>Among the projects being financed in the new city budget is a plan to transform a row of piers on the Brooklyn waterfront into an 80-acre park of rolling hills, green lawns and ball courts.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and City Council leaders pledged $64 million over four years for the park at the foot of Brooklyn Heights, the first time City Hall has committed money to the project.</p>
        <p>The budget includes $7 million to begin construction over the next year. That work could include the creation of a park entrance at Fulton Ferry Landing and the expansion of an existing state park on the site, park planners said.</p>
        <p>''The park is something we deserve,'' said Herbert E. Berman, the chairman of the council's finance committee. ''It's a recognition that Brooklyn exists.''</p>
        <p>Part of the money approved by the council, $13.5 million, comes from the budget of Howard Golden, the borough president. But a bulk of the city money, about $45 million, depends on obtaining an additional $80 million from the state and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles said questions about the boundaries of the park, the management of the project and the role of the City Parks Department must also be answered before the additional city money was committed.</p>
        <p>Some residents have criticized the plan as too commercial and too much of a departure from a traditional park. Residents on Joralemon Street, a quiet stretch of multimillion-dollar brownstones that leads to the waterfront, are concerned that the park will draw foot traffic, bringing in outsiders and changing the character of their blocks.</p>
        <p>''I think the plan is far from being complete, even as a vision,'' said Donald Rattner, an architect from the neighborhood who is working with groups opposed to the park plan. ''That is why it is disconcerting to see it go forward.''</p>
        <p>Despite such criticism, the project has widespread support, planners said. The Port Authority has backed the project, and a spokesman said yesterday that the agency had been discussing how to pay for the park with officials from the development corporation and the state. The state parks department has begun renovating the small state park between the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges, but has not pledged money directly to the larger project.</p>
        <p>''This park will address the severe shortage of open space in the borough,'' Councilman Kenneth K. Fisher said. ''It will act as Brooklyn's front yard, welcoming people to the borough.''</p>
