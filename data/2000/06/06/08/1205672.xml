        <p>The new cable channel Oxygen announced yesterday that it was suspending production on two shows and would be laying off about 12 people, in a move that one executive said was a result of the programs' exceeding their production budgets.</p>
        <p>The two shows, ''Pure Oxygen,'' which interviews celebrities, and ''Trackers,'' which is for teenagers, will run repeats over the summer, said Laura Nelson, the senior vice president for communications at Oxygen, and will return in the late summer or early fall. Both shows are two hours long.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nelson said the layoffs were not an indication of financial problems at the new channel, which has the backing of companies like America Online, the Walt Disney Company and the financier, Paul Allen.</p>
        <p>''We were able to do many more things on the shows than we expected to, which is what put them over budget,'' Ms. Nelson said. She added that  ''Trackers'' had been able to book musical guests like Marc Anthony and that ''Pure Oxygen'' had been able to interview guests like Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>''We just did too much production, and the shows went over budget,'' Ms. Nelson said. ''They'll be in repeats this summer and be back in the fall, just like a lot of other shows.''</p>
        <p>Most staff members, she said, will spend the summer developing material that will be used next fall.</p>
        <p>Only jobs like that of audience coordinator -- who brings in audiences for the shows -- have been terminated, she said.</p>
        <p>''We don't need an audience if we're not in production,'' Ms. Nelson said. ''We'll fill those jobs again in the fall.''</p>
        <p>Oxygen had one of the strongest starts of any recent cable channel, with 10 million subscribers when it began in February and a programming budget of $450 million. It is not yet being carried in some of the biggest cities, including New York and Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The company is also being closely watched because of its high-profile management. Its chief executive is Geraldine Laybourne, who was chairman of Nickelodeon during that channel's years of enormous growth, followed by a less successful stint as president of Disney Cable.</p>
        <p>The company's partners include the talk show host Oprah Winfrey and the three principals in the Carsey-Werner-Mandabach television production company: Marcy Carsey, Tom Werner and Caryn Mandabach.</p>
