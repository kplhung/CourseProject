        <p>Correction of June 7 article: $25.4 billion of fiscal 2001 budget will come from city tax revenue, not $27.7 billion</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article yesterday about the City Council's adoption of a budget misstated the amount of money the city plans to spend in the 2001 fiscal year that would come from city tax revenue. It is $25.4 billion, a 3 percent decline in spending from the current fiscal year, not $27.7 billion. That figure, provided by the City Council staff, was higher because it includes payments the city will make before the end of this fiscal year on June 30, to cover debt service costs that come due in the next fiscal year.</p>
