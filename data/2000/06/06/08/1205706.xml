        <p>An antimissile laser destroyed an armed Katyusha rocket in flight during a test in New Mexico on Tuesday, the United States Army said yesterday. The development moves the laser a step closer to possible deployment along Israel's border with Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Missile defenses based on lasers have been developed, tested and debated for decades, but none has been deployed.</p>
        <p>Built by a California contractor, TRW, and the United States Army, the powerful laser has been designed to defend against guerrilla rocket attacks along Israel's northern border. The system, called the tactical high energy laser, is being built at a cost of about $200 million.</p>
        <p>At the Army's White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the laser focused its light on the moving Katyusha's warhead, heating and destroying it, about a month after a successful test against a stationary target.</p>
        <p>''The test yesterday was the first attempt at achieving a shootdown of a rocket, and it was successful,'' said Dr. Thomas Romesser, vice president and deputy general manager for laser programs at TRW.</p>
        <p>Most missile defense systems under development have moved to a ''hit-to-kill'' technology, using rocket-propelled interceptors. In the 1980's, laser-based defenses were criticized as technically unworkable, but research continues on several antimissile lasers.</p>
        <p>Aside from the Israeli-American program to defend against short-range missiles, there is an Air Force program in early tests to shoot down missiles by use of a laser mounted on a jumbo jet, and there is also an effort run by the Pentagon to shoot down intercontinental ballistic missiles with lasers fired from space.</p>
        <p>All of those lasers are powered by chemical reactions that generate intense light. Dr. Romesser said that the test on Tuesday demonstrated that laser defenses could work. ''I think that there will be a lot of enthusiasm to move forward with these types of weapons systems because they really are effective,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Israeli-American system consists of several modules the size of tractor trailers and containing radar, an optical telescope, the laser and a command and communications center. All worked together properly in the test, said Richard Bradshaw, director of the directed-energy, or laser, program at the Army Space and Missile Defense Command. ''We turned on the high power beam and the very first time put power on the target and it blew up,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the command said that after new tests against multiple incoming warheads, the system could be shipped to Israel for further testing and possible deployment as early as September.</p>
        <p>Israel's northern border has been quiet, without rocket launchings or guerrilla attacks, since Israel pulled out of a military buffer zone in southern Lebanon two weeks ago.</p>
