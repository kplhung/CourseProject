      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Suffolk County sheriff has publicly questioned the district attorney's mental stability. He has referred to him as a fascist.</p>
        <p>The district attorney, in turn, has called the sheriff his sworn enemy. And now the sheriff is accusing the district attorney of using his prosecutorial powers to ruin him simply because ''he hates me.''</p>
        <p>The feud between Sheriff Patrick A. Mahoney, 57, and District Attorney James M. Catterson Jr., 69, is so old and so well known on Long Island that many have simply ignored the noise made when the two powerful men butt heads.</p>
        <p>But even the most hardened lawyers and politicians took notice on Tuesday when the sheriff and his former top assistant were forced to surrender in county court. They were arraigned on dozens of charges that during Mr. Mahoney's 11-year tenure, they used the sheriff's office as a campaign headquarters and forced some of the 1,000 employees at the county jail to pay kickbacks in return for promotions and overtime.</p>
        <p>Those in the Mahoney camp dismiss the case as a personal vendetta by the district attorney, aided by a correction officers union that wants to control the jail. But seasoned courthouse lawyers say that a 103-page, 90-count indictment handed up by a grand jury after a 15-month investigation suggests something more serious. A feud defense, they say, is unlikely to benefit the sheriff.</p>
        <p>'' 'He hates me,' you can't put that issue up as a defense,'' said Edward P. Jenks, a prominent Nassau County defense lawyer. ''It's good for the newspaper pages but not the courtroom. After all, the district attorney interviewed 130 witnesses. There very well may be something there. One thing's for sure, it's going to be a real dog-and-pony show when it goes to trial.''</p>
        <p>Sheriff Mahoney, who was released on his own recognizance after pleading not guilty, is charged with  one felony count of defrauding the government and 54 misdemeanor counts. The most serious charge stems from the testimony of William Posh, a sheriff's aide, who said in an affidavit that former Undersheriff Edward J. Morris put him in an office next to the sheriff, gave him a computer and told him to keep track of political contributions made by Sheriff's Department officers, employees, special deputy sheriffs and others.</p>
        <p>The computer was used to keep track of check amounts, dates and personal information on contributors, according to the indictment. The felony count charges that the aide was a paid county employee while working full time for the sheriff's re-election campaign, said Christopher McPartland, the acting bureau chief of rackets for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office.</p>
        <p>The undersheriff, Mr. Morris, faces 29 felony counts and 60 misdemeanors, the most serious charges being bribery. He pleaded not guilty to all counts and was released. He is accused of coercing correction officers under his command into making campaign contributions to the sheriff in exchange for overtime work.</p>
        <p>The sheriff and Mr. Morris are also accused of using county copiers, fax machines and vehicles for political use, and giving special deputy jobs -- honorary posts awarded to private citizens -- to the highest bidder.</p>
        <p>According to the indictment, the appointment of a special deputy sheriff, Frank Canale, was rescinded in late 1993. He was reinstated a year later, after the Mahoney re-election committee received a contribution check from Mr. Canale. The indictment says that this happened at least half a dozen times, and that some of the positions were given to people who live outside the county, a violation of state law.</p>
        <p>The sheriff and Mr. Morris are also accused of taking $16,000 worth of campaign paraphernalia from the Sheriff's Benevolent Fund but never paying for it, and the sheriff is  charged with sending prison laborers to do work at the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame, where Mr. Morris was and still is executive director.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Sheriff Mahoney said the case was thin, and wondered why Mr. Catterson did not ask for a special prosecutor to investigate the allegations of corruption at the county jail, given the very public acrimony between the two men.</p>
        <p>''Catterson took 15 months and spent $2 million and came back with a single felony count,'' said Douglas T. Burns, one of Mr. Mahoney's lawyers. ''It seems unlikely that Mr. Catterson would bring this chase against a political ally.''</p>
        <p>By all accounts the men are cloth from the same bolt: tough, uncompromising and proud. They have never had a good relationship, but were at least cordial at one time, said John Cochrane, the Suffolk County treasurer and a former county Republican leader. They even endorsed each other in 1989 when they first ran for their current seats.</p>
        <p>''But as far as I can recall, there was never any good blood,'' Mr. Cochrane said. ''It all seemed to escalate after Katie Beers.''</p>
        <p>In 1993, Katie Beers, 10, was found alive in a makeshift dungeon after 16 days. The district attorney seheduled a news conference with Katie and her mother on the courthouse steps, but the sheriff refused to turn the girl over, saying she had suffered enough.</p>
        <p>A year after the Beers incident, the sheriff was the first to make public a tangled county car-leasing deal arranged by Mr. Catterson's son, James 3rd, who was then deputy county attorney. Then in 1997, the sheriff sent a letter to Gov. George E. Pataki accusing Mr. Catterson of intimidating a grand juror. State investigators found the charge baseless.</p>
        <p>Long Island has a sordid tradition of political scandals that includes sewer contract corruption, police misconduct and allegations of bribery. To some of those who remember these bad old days, the 55 counts against the sheriff seem excessive .</p>
        <p>''Is it personal or political?'' Mr. Cochrane asked. ''I don't know. There are a lot of miscellaneous charges like using a government letter opener. Do you categorize that as an indictable offense?''</p>
