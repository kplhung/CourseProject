        <p>The game of musical chairs sweeping the global airline industry expanded to yet more players yesterday but it appears that it will be some time before the music stops.</p>
        <p>In London, British Airways, Europe's largest airline, and the Netherlands-based carrier, KLM Royal Dutch, acknowledged they had entered into merger negotiations. Across the Atlantic, the AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines held preliminary merger discussions earlier this week, according to two people close to the talks.</p>
        <p>The talks between AMR and Delta followed an overture by AMR to Northwest Airlines. Those discussions in turn were a response to the proposed acquisition of US Airways by UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, for $4.3 billion, a deal that would create the world's largest airline. That poses a direct threat to American and Delta, the nation's second-  and third-largest carriers.</p>
        <p>Airlines are increasingly keen to merge to expand their networks and pare costs. UAL has said that buying US Airways, the largest carrier on the East Cost, will fill a large hole in its route network, making it more attractive to corporate customers and to its airline partners in Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p>Shares of all four airlines in the latest reported pairings rose yesterday. KLM shares surged 8.5 percent, to 30.1 euros, or $28.29, and have risen 45 percent since rumors that it might be purchased began to swirl weeks ago. British Airways shares rose 1.3 percent, to 390 pence, or about $5.85. Delta shares rose 3.2 percent, or $1.625, to $52.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, and AMR shares rose 12.5 cents, to $28.4375.</p>
        <p>Despite the reaction to the talks in the stock market, it is difficult to combine airlines smoothly. British Airways and KLM tried once before, in 1992, but the deal foundered over price. Yet even if the two managements can agree on price and management control, the powerful role played by labor unions often makes mergers difficult. In addition, there is a real chance that government regulators would block such large deals.</p>
        <p>Both British Airways and KLM dominate their respective home markets and have little room to expand. They have have also been hurt by competition that has eroded their profit margins.</p>
        <p>A British Airways-KLM would create the world's fourth-largest airline, with $19.5 billion in sales. It would have hubs outside of London serving trans-Atlantic and long-haul flights to Asia as well as a hub outside Amsterdam that could serve intra-Europe routes.</p>
        <p>''It is a necessity for consolidation to take place,'' said Andrew Light, an aviation analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London. He said a deal was especially important for KLM, which broke off its alliance with Alitalia of Italy in April. ''It gives them a lifeline,'' he said. ''They are desperately in a need of a partner.''</p>
        <p>Both British Airways and KLM  cautioned that the talks were ''at a preliminary stage.'' Executives close to the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity said that it would take considerable time to negotiate any deal. The executives said price had not been significantly discussed yet. But on the assumption that a deal would be structured as a British Airways purchase of KLM, analysts estimate KLM's price could exceed $2 billion.</p>
        <p>KLM has a strong alliance with Northwest Airlines in which the two carriers have merged their trans-Atlantic operations. British Airways has an alliance with AMR. Those were among reasons many analysts believe an AMR merger with Northwest makes the most sense.</p>
        <p>But people close to the initial talks between the two carriers said Northwest sought a premium price, which gave AMR pause. The talks between AMR and Delta, which took place in New York on Monday and were reported by The Wall Street Journal, were also described as very preliminary. Present at the meeting were Edward H. West and Thomas W. Horton, the chief financial officers of Delta and AMR, along with lawyers and investment bankers from Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, representing Delta, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, representing AMR.</p>
        <p>''I think people walked away from it with the conclusion: here are some things we need to think about,'' said one person close to the discussions. It is not clear when the two sides willd meet again.</p>
        <p>A merger would bring together Delta's strong European and East Coast routes with American's dominance of Latin America and its access to Heathrow Airport in London. But the two carriers together would control nearly 40 percent of the domestic market and they overlap heavily in the South and Southwest. In addition, neither has a strong network in Asia, which is a jewel in Northwest's crown.</p>
        <p>That is why most analysts say they believe AMR and Northwest make a better fit while Delta and Continental Airlines are considered more suitable partners. But as all the recent activity proves, nothing is ruled out. Some analysts and airline executives said they believed that the talks involving AMR were publicized at such an early stage to try to scuttle the UAL-US Airways deal by alarming antitrust regulators in Washington. They may also have been intended to send a message to Northwest that it may be passed over if it does not lower its asking price.</p>
