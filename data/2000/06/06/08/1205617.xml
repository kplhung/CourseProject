        <p>IT is a well-known axiom that there is a correlation between the size of a house and the number of headaches it causes. And in the Hamptons, their severity increases exponentially as one proceeds east along Route 27 to the windmill in East Hampton.</p>
        <p>Cynthia Rowley, the fashion designer, and her husband, Bill Keenan, a designer and sculptor, shucked the headaches involved in owning a shingled four-bedroom stunner in the estate section of East Hampton and moved instead to a surfer's shack in Montauk.</p>
        <p>Time, not money, was the issue. Ms. Rowley's witty romantic garb and a business with $20 million in sales last year have attracted the interests of the Pegasus Apparel Group, a fashion conglomerate, which is in conversations with Ms. Rowley. And the couple already own homes in TriBeCa and upstate New York. Their house in Long Island was meant to be someplace to enjoy with their baby daughter, Kit Clementine.</p>
        <p>''I'd be so busy at work,'' Ms. Rowley said of the summer five years ago, a time when she was building a retail franchise that now includes a shop in East Hampton and six other stores around the world, in addition to 27 in-store boutiques in Asia. Also, 1995 was the year she and her husband set up their East Hampton house on Hedges Lane, known for its rambling privet-cloaked getaways with a pedigree.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rowley recalled: ''I'd get out there on the weekend, and the neighbors would call to say, 'Hi! Your grass should be cut. It really is getting a little too long.' And the pool would have some problem. There'd be something else going wrong with the air-conditioner. It was such a bad experience.''</p>
        <p>That was in addition to the weekend guests. ''Not that I'm not social, but every weekend, so many people. . . . '' Ms. Rowley said, trailing off at the memory of so many dirty towels and sheets.</p>
        <p>Six months after buying the place for $925,000, they put it back on the market (where it sold for $1.1 million) and started looking for something smaller. ''Something that we could clean with a broom in under five minutes,'' Mr. Keenan said.</p>
        <p>They headed east for Montauk, where turrets and swollen eyebrow windows are in shorter supply than in the snootier Hamptons.</p>
        <p>''Got a shack?'' Ms. Rowley asked a local Montauk realtor.</p>
        <p>Ada Stevens of Kathleen G. Beckmann Real Estate remembered the visit. ''They came in a pickup truck, and she was wearing this little cotton print dress,'' Ms. Stevens said. ''They were very low-keyed, and I had no idea who she was.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rowley, 40, doesn't indulge in the fashion diva act that her mid-size clothing domain would entitle her to. Rather, she behaves like the quintessential best girlfriend, the one who is a little ditsy but ever at the ready to lend moral support -- and maybe a great outfit. Mr. Keenan, 47, matches his wife in blithe, borderline goofy spirit, although he appears to be a tad more on the ball when it comes to things like taking an extra baby bottle to lunch and monitoring their daughter's intake of French fries.</p>
        <p>They remembered the real estate agent's taking them to Ditch Plains Road, where bland little houses, surfer's huts and Dew Drop Inn-type motels vie for obscurity. A two-car-garage-size house, only 200 yards from the beach, caught their eye.</p>
        <p>Actually, Mr. Keenan said, it was love at first sight. The flat roof, glass sliding barn door and deep overhang reminded him of something by Richard Neutra, the California modernist. ''Yeah, if you squint and drive by real fast,'' Ms. Rowley said. To her, it looked ''early gas station.''</p>
        <p>Its period modernity appealed to the couple's aesthetic interest in everything resolutely 20th century, and especially anything with a spark of midcentury optimism: for them, the World's Fair of 1964 and ''The Jetsons'' cartoons are watersheds in design savvy. And this place was rife with diner details, like the built-in sofas, no more than hinged platforms lowered by chain from the wall; Jacques Cousteau porthole lighting; and combed plywood walls that fairly screamed 1950's rec room.</p>
        <p>They bought the place on the spot, paying the asking price of $189,000, Ms. Stevens said. ''If you tore it down and put in an upside-down contemporary, you would more than likely get a view of West Lake,'' she said, referring to the kind of top-heavy houses straining to get a load of the sea that are so typical in other parts of the Hamptons. So far, this neighborly street of skinny plots doesn't have any of them.</p>
        <p>But the couple had no intention of making significant changes. They especially didn't want to make the house larger.</p>
        <p>''No fuss, no muss, no Calvin Klein $12 million shingled house for us,'' Mr. Keenan said.</p>
        <p>For a guest house, there's an Airstream trailer parked in the backyard, while the couple await approval to convert a free-standing garage on the property into a guest house. Meanwhile, the vintage 1969 trailer is ''the perfect self-contained environment,'' Ms. Rowley said. ''It has everything.'' (She noted brightly, however, that for weekend guests, ''you can't have people who are too fancy.'')</p>
        <p>The house, basically a single room with a galley kitchen and a corner partitioned off as a sleeping alcove, turned out to have some serious structural problems. The roof had to be replaced in the wake of a 15-year leak, and the couple took the opportunity to open the place up a bit. ''It was so crowded you had to go outside to turn around,'' Mr. Keenan said.</p>
        <p>They tore out eight built-in sofas that doubled as bunk beds. The couple removed a closet in order to fit in a queen-size mattress and a small bedside table. A sliding panel made of wavy greenhouse plastic slides back and forth in front of the bedroom.</p>
        <p>''For privacy,'' Mr. Keenan said. The baby, who just turned 1, sleeps in a portable crib, for now.</p>
        <p>Furniture, too, was kept to a minimum. ''We knew we could only have a few pieces, so we had to choose carefully,'' Ms. Rowley said.</p>
        <p>Her favorite shopping grounds are flea markets, garage sales and street curbs. The 60's motel mood is up to the minute, from the Greek flokati rug to the Ikea dresser that Mr. Keenan altered by tacking on spindly legs and clunky drawer knobs. On the hearth there is a vintage Bongo Board made quasi famous by Hugh Hefner's ''Playboy After Dark'' television show.</p>
        <p>The $350 Dux couch was ordered in the most diminutive size available and then reupholstered in an expensive nubby green wool. ''You can't skimp on everything,'' said Ms. Rowley, who was wearing a backless top made of two silk scarves that had been found at a flea market and then sewn together along the bias.</p>
        <p>As with most of the furnishings, the tables in the house came in at less than $10 and were picked up at garage sales. The larger, metal one in the center of the room, which doubles as a dinner table because there's no place else to eat, looks as if it were designed by Richard Schultz, well known for his modern garden furniture.</p>
        <p>Future plans include adding a breezeway to the garage, which Mr. Keenan uses as an art studio. He envisions it as a curved arc, ''like the Dulles wing,'' he said referring to the Washington airport.</p>
        <p>But that could take a while. ''The whole idea is to come here and not do much,'' Mr. Keenan said.</p>
        <p>Besides, Ms. Rowley added: ''With so few walls and so little floor space, I consider it done. We can't do anymore.''</p>
        <p>The Airstream trailer has become the solution of choice for people who need just a little bit more room. Story on page 12.</p>
