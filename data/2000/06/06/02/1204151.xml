        <p>The National Football League is planning to let its four television partners wire its players with microphones and put miniature cameras inside their helmets during preseason games.</p>
        <p>''The idea is to experiment in the preseason and see how it works,'' said Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the league. If the plan works out, the technological toys could be used in the regular season.</p>
        <p>''But it may not be likely for this season,'' Aiello said.</p>
        <p>He added that the most likely player to wear a ''HelmetCam'' or a microphone would be the quarterback so viewers could hear him barking signals. ''But it could be done for the free safety or the middle linebacker,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Umpires may also be outfitted with miniature cameras.</p>
        <p>ABC, CBS, Fox and ESPN have wanted to use such enhancements for years -- similar to those used by the old World League of American Football -- but the league resisted. Last season, cameras were allowed into locker rooms before games, and one player per team could wear a microphone during pre-game warmups.</p>
        <p>Don Ohlmeyer, the producer of ABC's ''Monday Night Football,'' asked owners last month to expand the use of cameras and sound this season.</p>
        <p>The N.F.L. may be reacting to the wishes of networks paying a combined $2.2 billion a year for the rights to show games -- as well as to the announced plans of the XFL, the football league created by the World Wrestling Federation and NBC, which starts play next February. It is planning to employ a wide range of miniature cameras to bring the game closer to viewers.</p>
        <p>''Anytime you can get better access to the game with shots that haven't been seen before, it's significant,'' said Fred Gaudelli, ESPN's senior N.F.L. coordinating producer. ''It's significant to hear what the quarterback is saying.''</p>
        <p>He does not believe the N.F.L. is reacting to the XFL.</p>
        <p>''That's not their style,'' he said.</p>
