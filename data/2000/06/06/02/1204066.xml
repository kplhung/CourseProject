        <p>The mainstreaming of gay and lesbian themes into mass culture has proceeded so swiftly in the last several years that the notion of a film or television show's being a piece of ''gay'' popular art isn't as clear-cut as it used to be.</p>
        <p>Is ''Will and Grace'' a gay sitcom? Or is it a show that offers a stylishly racy new twist on an ''Odd Couple'' format as old as comedy itself? And what does it say about today's sexual climate that at a moment when it's practically de rigeur for an upscale urban comedy to include secondary characters who are gay, a movie or television show set in a predominantly gay milieu is still box office poison? And why is it O.K. for two women to exchange passionate kisses in a Hollywood film, but not two men? It's all quite confusing.</p>

        <p>The mainstreaming of gay and lesbian themes into mass culture has proceeded so swiftly in the last several years that the notion of a film or television show's being a piece of ''gay'' popular art isn't as clear-cut as it used to be.</p>
        <p>Is ''Will and Grace'' a gay sitcom? Or is it a show that offers a stylishly racy new twist on an ''Odd Couple'' format as old as comedy itself? And what does it say about today's sexual climate that at a moment when it's practically de rigeur for an upscale urban comedy to include secondary characters who are gay, a movie or television show set in a predominantly gay milieu is still box office poison? And why is it O.K. for two women to exchange passionate kisses in a Hollywood film, but not two men? It's all quite confusing.</p>
        <p>These shifts in the cultural climate seemed to dilute last year's 11th annual New York Lesbian and Gay Film Festival (also known as the New Festival), in which several feature films seemed as frothy (and disposable) as any mainstream sitcom.</p>
        <p>But this year things are different. The 11-day festival at New York University and the New School opened last night with Jamie Babbit's comedy ''But I'm a Cheerleader,'' the story of a model high school girl whose paranoid family sends her to a rehabilitation camp to cure her of her supposed lesbianism. The movie, which is to open commercially later this year, is campy satire with political bite.</p>
        <p>Leading the list of significant feature films in this year's festival is Max Farberbock's ''Aimee and Jaguar.'' Based on a book by Erica Fischer, the German film, set in wartime Berlin, tells the true love story of Felice Schragenheim, an assimilated German Jew secretly working for the Jewish resistance, and Lilly Wurst, a housewife and mother married to a German Army officer.</p>
        <p>The gorgeously photographed film has an epic sweep and avoids the puppetlike Nazi caricatures that have afflicted so many films set in this period. At its center are heart-wrenching performances by Maria Schrader as Felice, a wary-eyed woman walking a hair-raising tightrope, who is drawn into the affair almost against her will, and Juliane Kohler as Lilly, who, once unmoored from her bourgeois security, becomes desperately dependent. ''Aimee and Jaguar'' will be shown tomorrow at 7 p.m. at New York University.</p>
        <p>''Rollercoaster,'' the first film of Scott Smith, captures the crude, anarchic language of alienated teenagers with an astoundingly acute ear. This Canadian movie, to be shown on Sunday at 4 p.m. at the New School, follows five troubled teenagers who live in a group home in a Vancouver suburb into a nearly deserted amusement park. Two of them have secretly forged a suicide pact in which they plan to jump off a rollercoaster at the end of the day. Another, struggling with his homosexuality, is emotionally torn apart after being molested by a security guard in a restroom. The impressive film captures the raw emotions and daredevil vulnerability of adolescence with a scary accuracy.</p>
        <p>''Water Drops on Burning Rocks,'' by the talented French director Francois Ozon (''See the Sea'' and ''Sitcom'') is a film version of a play written by Rainer Werner Fassbinder when he was just 19. Filmed in the stylized, abrupt manner of a Fassbinder film, the movie examines the demonic relationship of Leopold (Bernard Giraudeau), an arrogant 50-year-old businessman, and Franz (Malik Zidi), a 19-year-old boy he picks up, seduces and makes his household servant as well as his lover. Things get complicated (and perverse) with the appearance of Franz's discarded girlfriend, Anna (Ludivine Sagnier), and Leopold's abject transsexual ex-lover, Vera (Anna Thomson). The movie, to be shown tomorrow at 8 p.m. at the New School, could be described as a mock comedy of manners with a heart of ice.</p>
        <p>Jon Shear's ''Urbania,'' which opens commercially later this year, is a psychological thriller drenched in ominous urban atmosphere that takes place largely in the mind of a troubled young man (Dan Futterman) mourning the recent death of his lover. As he rambles through some of the danker streets of Lower Manhattan, his experiences become confused with grim urban folk tales involving sex and violence. His eventual pursuit of a mysterious, sinister tattooed man culminates in a violent, semi-cathartic confrontation. The movie will be shown tonight at 8 at the New School.</p>
        <p>Finally, there is Nisha Ganatra's serious comedy ''Chutney Popcorn,'' the story of Reena (Ms. Ganatra), a lesbian Indian photographer who volunteers to have a child for her newly married but infertile elder sister. When the sister changes her mind about motherhood Reena decides to have the child anyway, despite the objections of her lover, Lisa (Jill Hennessy), who wasn't consulted in the first place. Hovering in the background, scolding and wringing her hands, is the sisters' disapproving, homophobic mother.</p>
        <p>These are just a half-dozen selections from a festival that will include 36 dramatic features, 23 documentaries and 100 short films.</p>
        <p>Tickets for the 12th annual New Festival are available at a Different Light Bookstore, 151 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (646) 638-2327. The New School is at 66 West 12th Street, Greenwich Village. The screenings at New York University are at the Cantor Film Center, 36 East Eighth Street, at University Place.</p>
