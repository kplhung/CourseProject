        <p>LARSEN-Patricia Pike. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art and its International Council and staff are deeply saddened by the passing of Patricia Larsen, a longtime friend of the Museum, a donor to its collection, and a treasured member of the Council since 1970. We remember her as an inveterate traveler on Council trips, and as someone whose spirit and energy was greatly complemented by her abiding grace and wit. We send our deepest sympathy to her children, grandchildren, and extended family. Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Agnes Gund, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, NY Brian Urquhart, Chairman Jo Carole Lauder, President The International Council of The Musuem of Modern Art</p>
