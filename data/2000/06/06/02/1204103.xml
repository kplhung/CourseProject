        <p>During World War II it was possible to play a recorded greeting from home, but for Sgt. Warnicki (Freddie Steele) in William Wellman's ''Story of G.I. Joe,'' it necessitates lugging a large Victrola all over Italy. At each pause in battle he hauls out the carefully wrapped machine and the record his wife and child have made for him. Each time the recording plays backward, emitting unintelligible squawks. By the time it spins properly, he has gone mad with battle fatigue.</p>
        <p>Fans of the film, which opened in 1945 and at the time was considered one of the most realistic war movies ever, might liken Warnicki's frustration to their own at its failure to appear on video. Last week Image Entertainment released the first tape and DVD editions. ''It has been one of our most requested titles for at least 15 years,'' said Irv Slifkin of Movies Unlimited, a large video mail order company in Philadelphia.</p>

        <p>During World War II it was possible to play a recorded greeting from home, but for Sgt. Warnicki (Freddie Steele) in William Wellman's ''Story of G.I. Joe,'' it necessitates lugging a large Victrola all over Italy. At each pause in battle he hauls out the carefully wrapped machine and the record his wife and child have made for him. Each time the recording plays backward, emitting unintelligible squawks. By the time it spins properly, he has gone mad with battle fatigue.</p>
        <p>Fans of the film, which opened in 1945 and at the time was considered one of the most realistic war movies ever, might liken Warnicki's frustration to their own at its failure to appear on video. Last week Image Entertainment released the first tape and DVD editions. ''It has been one of our most requested titles for at least 15 years,'' said Irv Slifkin of Movies Unlimited, a large video mail order company in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Where has it been? Larry Stern, president of Video-Cinema Films Inc., a Manhattan distributor and the film's copyright owner, described a meandering trail that goes back to 1970, when he made a deal with Lester Cowan, the movie's producer, to place it on television.</p>
        <p>That agreement lasted until 1982, with control resting solely with the Cowan family. In 1997 the film was again licensed to Mr. Stern, who subsequently made a deal with Image Entertainment to release it on video. In 1972, he said in an interview, he had two 35-millimeter prints made. Image did the restoration work, resulting in a fine disc and tape.</p>
        <p>Viewed today, ''The Story of G.I. Joe'' is something of a relic, though unlike many of today's films it tries to be stirring without being slathered with sloppy sentimentality. When a soldier dies, a comrade says he'll never get a letter from Betty. Fine, someone snarls, she'll never get one from him.</p>
        <p>The film is based on the writings of the war correspondent Ernie Pyle (portrayed by Burgess Meredith), who tags along with the troops from Tunisia and Sicily to Casino and up the road to Rome. Pyle, a Scripps-Howard reporter, was a stickler for telling it like it was for the foot soldier. But the film never loses a certain gentility. While the fighting is intense, the violence is implied rather than graphic. Bodies turn up, but there is no actual bloodshed, and it is startling to hear soldiers yell things like ''Watch it there, fella!'' instead of the threats and obscenities in today's action films. As muddy as these troops get, they're a clean bunch.</p>
        <p>The film had its beginnings during the war when the Army wanted to counteract the rising influence of the Air Corps and Navy. Cowan, then a young producer, was interested in making a movie about the infantry. He was directed to Pyle, who took a personal interest, nixing James Cagney, whom he disliked, to play himself. He did want Arthur Miller to write the screenplay, but Mr. Miller didn't like Cowan and withdrew. Robert Mitchum, never more droopy-eyed, had his first starring role as Captain Walker. Pyle was killed in the Pacific in 1944.</p>
