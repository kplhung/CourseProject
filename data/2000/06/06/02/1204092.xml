        <p>Ian Woodner, the Manhattan real estate developer who died in 1990, was one of the greatest collectors in the United States. Besides an extraordinary group of drawings, some of which were acquired by the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1991, he amassed a large group of Cycladic works of art.</p>
        <p>He also had passion for paintings, drawings and prints by the 19th-century French artist Odilon Redon. He put together the largest group of Redons in the world.</p>
        <p>Woodner's two daughters, Dian and Andrea, oversee the Ian Woodner Family Collection, a foundation that Woodner established before his death. They have given the Museum of Modern Art nearly 100 paintings, pastels, watercolors, drawings, prints and illustrated books by Redon.</p>
        <p>''My father was a painter, too, and he would paint in the style of Redon,'' said Dian Woodner.</p>
        <p>The works the foundation is giving the Modern represent only about half of Woodner's collection of Redons. Some still belong to his daughters, said Joshua Rubenstein, Dian Woodner's lawyer.</p>
        <p>Ms. Woodner said she and her sister wanted to develop a relationship with an institution in their hometown, which is one reason they chose to give the Redons to the Modern. The other, she added, was that ''Redon is one of the first modern painters, and I think his work will shine at the Modern.''</p>
        <p>Glenn D. Lowry, the Modern's director, called the gift ''one that came from heaven.''</p>
        <p>''Redon was an artist we never had great strength in,'' he added. ''Now, in one shot, we have a collection that puts us second only to the Musee d'Orsay in both range and quality.''</p>
        <p>The gift includes early studies from nature, still lifes and mythological images.</p>
        <p>While individual works from the Woodner collection will be on view from time to time, Mr. Lowry said the museum was planning an exhibition devoted to the entire collection once its major expansion is completed in four to five years.</p>
        <p>Biennial Buys</p>
        <p>The Whitney Museum of American Art has made a tradition of buying a selection of works it features in its Biennials. Curators compile lists of works they would like the museum to buy and then make proposals to the appropriate committees, made up of trustees and others who help raise the money and make the final decisions.</p>
        <p>This year the museum has bought works by 20 Biennial artists. ''It's a varied list,'' said Lawrence Rinder, the new curator of contemporary art. ''Half are by artists who have not been represented in the Whitney's collection before.'' Mr. Rinder stressed the importance of adding Biennial artists to the museum's collection. ''Great works by key American artists are an important legacy to continue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Among the artists entering the museum's collection for the first time are Dara Friedman, whose ''Bim Bam'' consists of two films, one shown directly above the other, projecting sideways images of a woman repeatedly opening and closing a door; Doug Aitken, whose ''Electric Earth,'' a video piece installed in a maze of rooms, won a prize at last summer's Venice Bienniale; Silvia Kolbowski, whose ''Inadequate History of Conceptual Art'' is a video and sound installation; Inigo Manglano-Ovalle's video installation ''The Kiss,'' which shows the artist washing a glass wall of Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House; and E. V. Day's exploded evening dress, ''Bombshell.''</p>
        <p>The museum also decided to add  works of artists already in its collection, but not necessarily with purchases from the Biennial. It is continuing to build a collection of works by Robert Gober, but rather than buy his sculpture of a sink with human legs that is in the Biennial, the museum has bought three more of his color lithographs.</p>
        <p>Dia's Museum</p>
        <p>Fourteen months after the Dia Center for the Arts announced that it would open a $20 million museum in an abandoned paperboard factory in Beacon, N.Y., a depressed Hudson River town, this contemporary arts institution is holding something of a groundbreaking ceremony today,  with Gov. George E. Pataki presiding.</p>
        <p>''We've finished the environmental cleanup and major construction is about to begin,'' said Michael Govan, director of Dia.</p>
        <p>Dia officials have drawn up plans for the building's renovations with Open Office, a Chelsea architectural firm. The scheme has also had advice from several living artists represented in Dia's collection, including Walter de Maria, Richard Serra, Michael Heizer and John Chamberlain, who have been involved in designing galleries devoted to their works.</p>
        <p>Robert Irwin, the California artist who designed the central garden for the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, has created a grid of flowering trees that form a canopy over the parking lot opening onto a piazza, which serves as the museum entrance. Mr. Irwin has also been involved in plans for the entire complex. ''He has orchestrated natural light throughout the building so there will never have to be lights on during daylight hours,'' Mr. Govan said.</p>
        <p>An Appointment</p>
        <p>Laurie Beckelman has been appointed to the new position of deputy director of special projects at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Ms. Beckelman is vice president of the World Monuments Fund and was previously executive director of the Joseph Papp Public Theater and chairwoman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.</p>
        <p>By special projects, the museum means the creation of the new museum, designed by the Los Angeles architect Frank O. Gehry, that it hopes to build overlooking the East River at the foot of Wall Street.</p>
        <p>''Laurie will be working on the progress of how to make it happen,'' said Judith Cox, a deputy director of the Guggenheim. ''She will help push that process along.</p>
