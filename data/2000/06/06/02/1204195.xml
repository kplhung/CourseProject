        <p>The only thing missing from Jim Florio's campaign headquarters here -- packed with boxes of political posters and telephone banks filled with volunteers -- are a few crates of dynamite sticks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio's aides have thrown everything else they had at Jon S. Corzine in this bitter but financially lopsided contest for the Democratic Senate nomination.</p>
        <p>Outspent by close to 20 to 1, and unbeloved by many Democratic voters to begin with, Mr. Florio has resorted to some guerrilla-style tactics, attacking Mr. Corzine every day from another angle and harassing him on the cheap.</p>
        <p>Now, in the final days before Tuesday's  primary, Mr. Florio and his top aides sense they may have succeeded in turning Mr. Corzine's huge monetary advantage into a liability. At least they fervently hope so.</p>
        <p>''We're finding that people are disgusted, put off, offended, by Jon Corzine's invasion into their homes,'' said Jim Lanard, Mr. Florio's spokesman, who was claiming  some encouraging feedback about the multitude of Corzine TV ads from the Florio phone banks. Overwhelmingly, he said, people were saying they were leaning toward Mr. Florio.</p>
        <p>But advisers to Mr. Corzine scoffed at such notions; their daily polls, they said, showed a momentary dip in Mr. Corzine's lead after Mr. Florio's first TV commercials went on the air on May 25. But since then, they said, Mr. Corzine's lead has returned to about 10 points.</p>
        <p>Certainly, the Florio campaign, which shares office space with the Camden County Democratic organization, is taking nothing for granted. As Mr. Lanard, sporting a day's growth of beard, dealt with reporters and television producers, a dozen volunteers from a grocery-workers' union stuffed envelopes, while about 20 others, including county workers supposedly volunteering on their own time, spoke into telephone receivers, reading from scripts warning that Mr. Corzine wants to ''risk $300 billion'' of the Social Security trust fund in the stock market.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lanard and Steve Ayscue, the bald-headed 30-year-old who is one of Mr. Florio's top political advisers, said that having precious little money to spend -- their budget for the primary is $2 million -- forced the campaign to rely heavily on volunteers and on a few well-chosen pieces of software to get direct-mail pieces sent out all over the state, and to ensure that their constant faxes would go to a list of Florio stalwarts.</p>
        <p>They have also found that psychological warfare can be quite inexpensive. Among the people on their fax and e-mail lists, for example, is Steven Goldstein, a co-chairman of Mr. Corzine's campaign. ''We send him everything, because we know they're going to get it anyway,'' Mr. Lanard said. ''They send us nothing.'' Mr. Ayscue, who has been accused of ''scorched earth'' tactics, and keeps a dart-board in his office with Mr. Corzine's smiling face as the target, gave a different reason for keeping his enemy posted: he motioned as if he were putting the screws to someone and said, ''We enjoy seeing them getting excited.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lanard, the more polite of the two, said, ''I see it as a courtesy.''</p>
        <p>Some of their tactics, however, have been of questionable value. One of Mr. Florio's first TV commercials attacked Mr. Corzine on the subject of Social Security, but misrepresented Mr. Corzine's position, falsely claiming that Mr. Corzine supported a Republican plan to privatize Social Security and replace it with a system of individual retirement accounts.</p>
        <p>The ad came across as a suicide bomb: one of Mr. Corzine's advisers conceded that their campaign had been forced to spend money on commercials setting the record straight, but wondered whether Mr. Florio's attack was worth it, since newspapers pointed out the inaccuracies.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Florio has been most effective at monopolizing newspaper coverage of the Senate race. Until the focus shifted to Mr. Corzine's record-setting spending, Mr. Florio had dominated news coverage of the campaign by offering a steady diet of news conferences calling into question one aspect or another of Mr. Corzine's business background at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>But David Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider College, in Lawrenceville, N.J., said Mr. Florio's scattershot approach might have left voters confused, or worse, uninterested.</p>
        <p>''Florio's criticism of Corzine has been all over the place,'' he said. ''It hasn't focused on those couple of basic issues that might have resonated with the average voter -- 'Who is this guy?' and, 'He's buying the race.' ''</p>
        <p>And Orin Kramer, a fund-raiser and adviser to Mr. Corzine, produced a mailing from Mr. Florio that he said depicted Mr. Corzine in a suggestive and vulgar way.</p>
        <p>In any case, as the race heads into its final weekend, Mr. Florio's aides seem at ease with themselves. Mr. Lanard previewed a new TV commercial boasting of three major newspaper endorsements of Mr. Florio, criticizing Mr. Corzine for hiring private investigators to look into Mr. Florio's background, and hitting on the ''buying the election'' theme that Mr. Rebovich said was so critical.</p>
