        <p>Unless there are some major surprises -- and there always are -- on Sunday night, Tony voters will declare that Broadway's best musical is ''Contact,'' which many people say is not a musical, and that its best play is ''Copenhagen,'' which many people say they simply don't understand.</p>
        <p>Confused? You should be.</p>
        <p>It has been that kind of year on Broadway, an odd mishmash of daring new work and lukewarm fare that has left theater professionals searching for a cohesive theme.</p>
        <p>All that confusion should end on Sunday, however, with the broadcast of the Tony Awards, Broadway's annual rite of self-congratulation, self-flagellation and, occasionally, even real, genuine drama. The awards, overseen by the American Theater Wing and the American League of Theaters and Producers, represent the single occasion each year when the theater's reach extends past the footlights and across the nation, creating a window of televised visibility when all the winners are superstars for as long as it takes to thank their parents and their pets.</p>
        <p>In the ceremony at Radio City Music Hall, 21 awards will be handed out: 12 during the high-profile CBS broadcast starting at 9, and 9 others during an earlier portion broadcast on PBS. CBS will handle the big awards, like best musical and best play, as well as those for revivals and all eight acting categories. PBS will broadcast the design, direction and special awards.</p>
        <p>Rosie O'Donnell is back as host and an executive producer of the show, bringing with her the hope that it will rebound from last year's dismal ratings. Her presence may provide a spark of life in a show whose 1999 incarnation could have been titled ''Night of 1,000 Unhappy Stars.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important, Tony officials are promising that production numbers from all the nominated musicals will make it on the air. Last year the show ran long, and a number from ''It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues'' was canceled at the last minute.</p>
        <p>''My absolute prediction?'' said Jed Bernstein, president of the league. ''The show will end at 11 o'clock on the dot, and every nominated musical will have been on the air.''</p>
        <p>But beyond a few major categories, solid predictions may be foolhardy.</p>
        <p>While the season's creative ups and downs may have caused concern about Broadway's future -- new plays, anyone? -- the lack of a single blockbuster is creating some highly competitive Tony races, in categories from best revival of a play, in which Tom Stoppard's ''Real Thing'' is head to head with Eugene O'Neill's ''Moon for the Misbegotten''; to best actress, in which the downtown newcomer Claudia Shear (''Dirty Blonde'') may just snag an award over several of her more Broadway-tested colleagues.</p>
        <p>And while the theater aficionado will certainly pay closer attention than the layman, even a casual viewer can see the potential drama in races that pit mother against daughter (Rosemary Harris of ''Waiting in the Wings'' and Jennifer Ehle of ''The Real Thing'' for best actress in a play), ''brother'' versus ''brother'' (Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly of ''True West'' for best actor in a play) and Susan Stroman against herself in two categories (best choreography and best direction of a musical, for ''Contact'' and ''The Music Man'').</p>
        <p>Heavy Favorites</p>
        <p>In an informal poll of 20 producers, press agents, nominees and other Broadway eggheads, only a few sure things seem to emerge.</p>
        <p>One of those locks seems to be on the evening's big prize, best musical.</p>
        <p>Despite protests from Local 802, the Broadway musicians' union, that ''Contact'' does not adhere to the standards of a traditional musical because it has no orchestra or original score, the show remains an overwhelming favorite to win, in the minds of those polled. The producers of ''The Wild Party,'' ''Swing!'' and ''James Joyce's 'The Dead' '' may not have to worry about drafting acceptance speeches; not one of the 20 voters thought any of those shows would win.</p>
        <p>The same story for the award for best play. ''Copenhagen,'' Michael Frayn's heady exploration of a critical moment in the lives of two famous physicists, is a near-unanimous choice, even though few of those asked could give a full explanation of what the drama was all about. ''Dirty Blonde,'' Ms. Shear's affectionate look at Mae West, is a long shot, some said, but lacks what one voter called ''the snob factor.''</p>
        <p>'' 'Copenhagen' makes you feel smarter for having seen it,'' said one producer, who, like all of the prognosticators, spoke on condition of anonymity. ''Even if you don't really understand it.''</p>
        <p>The producers of ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' which leads all shows, with 12 nominations, can probably breathe a little easier. The show, which had late competition from ''The Music Man'' for the award for best revival of a musical, was an overwhelming favorite of those polled. ''Kate'' also looks strong in the design categories, meaning it may lead all shows in total Tonys.</p>
        <p>Leading Lights</p>
        <p>In the individual acting categories, too, a couple of performers appear ready to be anointed.</p>
        <p>Brian Stokes Mitchell, who received terrific reviews for his work in ''Kate,'' is considered a near-certain winner as best leading actor in a musical. This is partly because of his work in that show. But it also reflects the opinion of many voters that Mr. Mitchell could easily have won in 1998 for ''Ragtime'' but was surprised by the late-season entry of Alan Cumming, who won for ''Cabaret.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell's only real competition would seem to be Craig Bierko (''The Music Man''), but few think his turn as a charming con man has a real chance.</p>
        <p>In the category for leading ladies in musicals, Heather Headley looks to be headed for her first Tony as well, for the title role in ''Aida,'' though Marin Mazzie (''Kate'') seems to be gaining support among those in the Broadway industry who feel badly about her never having won a Tony despite nominations for ''Passion'' in 1994 and ''Ragtime.''</p>
        <p>''This is the category which breaks your heart the most,'' said a producer who is friendly with Ms. Mazzie but voting for Ms. Headley. ''But Heather is the title character of an enormous show and the only thing that's great in it.''</p>
        <p>Beyond that, however, the landscape gets murkier, with several categories that have no clear winner and several nominees in the hunt.</p>
        <p>Time for Redemption</p>
        <p>The early awards on PBS, the favorite portion for many industry types, promise to be heavy on redemption and heartfelt recognition.</p>
        <p>The only bet-the-kid's-college-fund lock here is that Ms. Stroman will win for best choreography for ''Contact,'' besting her own effort on ''Music Man'' and those of Kathleen Marshall (''Kate'') and Lynne Taylor-Corbett (''Swing!''). In addition to being mightily talented, Ms. Stroman is extremely well liked in the business, and this looks to be her night.</p>
        <p>She is also favored to win for best direction of a musical. She is nominated for ''Contact'' and ''Music Man,'' though Michael Blakemore (''Kate'') may make a run for it. If Mr. Blakemore doesn't win, mind you, he'll probably make up for it soon after; he is the favorite to win best direction of a play, for ''Copenhagen.''</p>
        <p>For best score, there are two favorites. The first is ''Aida,'' by Elton John and Tim Rice, which has been shut out of the best musical category but is nonetheless a commercial hit. The logic for a win here is that it would allow voters who like the show -- especially those voters from out of town who would like to see it tour -- to express their support.</p>
        <p>The other option seems to be ''The Wild Party,'' by Michael John LaChuisa, which probably won't win best musical but is more aesthetically ambitious than the sugar-pop score for ''Aida.''</p>
        <p>For best book, opinion seemed to be coalescing around the script for ''James Joyce's 'The Dead,' '' adapted by Richard Nelson, which would once again prove the value of choosing the right source material. ''Contact,'' with a book by John Weidman, is also a contender, with a few voters favoring ''Wild Party.''</p>
        <p>But the real races will begin with the national broadcast on CBS.</p>
        <p>One of the most contested categories will probably be best revival of a play, in which voters were evenly split between ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' and ''The Real Thing.'' (The other two nominees, ''Amadeus,'' and ''The Price,'' registered nary a vote.)</p>
        <p>Here the voters are divided by a certain mild jingoism -- ''Moon'' is an American production, while ''Real Thing'' is a British import -- and a sense that a revival should involve something, well, dead.</p>
        <p>'' 'The Real Thing' is only 15 years old,'' said one agent, noting that he had a client in the 1984 Broadway production. ''O'Neill has that certain back-from-the-grave gravitas.''</p>
        <p>Another voter added, '' 'Moon' seems the kind of thing Broadway should be doing.''</p>
        <p>Still, several voters thought that ''Real Thing'' might have a slight edge by dint of an even more powerful phenomenon: O'Neill fatigue. In particular people mentioned last year's acclaimed four-hour production of ''The Iceman Cometh.''</p>
        <p>''People still remember 'Iceman,' and they remember it was loooong,'' a nonprofit producer said. '' 'The Real Thing' is contemporary and easier to sit through.''</p>
        <p>Likewise the leading men in both of those productions, Gabriel Byrne in ''Moon'' and Stephen Dillane in ''Real Thing,'' look to be neck and neck for best actor.</p>
        <p>The dark horse in the race is Mr. Hoffman, the rising film actor whose well-received turn in ''True West'' has only gilded his reputation. The other two nominees are Mr. Reilly, another hot movie talent who alternates roles with Mr. Hoffman in ''West,'' and David Suchet, who played the gloomy Salieri in the closed revival of ''Amadeus.''</p>
        <p>Who will win? Pushed to answer, a majority said that Mr. Dillane would carry the day, despite Mr. Byrne's name recognition from films.</p>
        <p>'It's Wide Open'</p>
        <p>Leading actress in a play is an even tighter category, with five talented performers in the mix: Ms. Ehle, Ms. Harris, Ms. Shear, Cherry Jones (''Moon'') and Jayne Atkinson (''The Rainmaker'').</p>
        <p>''I have heard every option,'' one producer said. ''It's wide open.''</p>
        <p>Handicapping this race is a process of elimination, voters say. Ms. Atkinson's show is long closed, so scratch her. Ms. Ehle is young; she'll have her day. (Just not this Sunday.)</p>
        <p>That leaves her mother, Ms. Harris, the older, sentimental choice; Ms. Jones, the Broadway insider choice; and Ms. Shear, the populist choice.</p>
        <p>While Ms. Jones has an edge in the informal tally, the race seems primed for an upset from Ms. Shear.</p>
        <p>A chatty, amiable sort, she has been active in interviews and pre-Tony promotional events. Voters also say that a nod for Ms. Shear here may be a way of acknowledging her other work on ''Dirty Blonde,'' which she also wrote; conceived with the show's director, James Lapine; and practically dragged to Broadway from a run downtown.</p>
        <p>''It won't win best play,'' one voter said, ''but she could be given a nod here to say, 'Good work, come again.' ''</p>
        <p>She also has a potential bloc of votes behind her from the Shubert Organization, Broadway's largest theater owner and a principal producer of ''Dirty Blonde.''</p>
        <p>Clash of Characters</p>
        <p>One of Ms. Shear's co-stars, Kevin Chamberlin, who plays a cross-dressing Mae West fan, is in the running for best featured actor. His principal competition is the respected English actor Roy Dotrice, who plays the crotchety father in ''Moon.''</p>
        <p>As is often the case, the winner will be determined by how voters choose between two of Broadway's favorite gestures: the crowning of a new star (i.e., Mr. Chamberlin) or the recognition of a veteran talent (the 77-year-old Mr. Dotrice).</p>
        <p>The straw poll suggests that Mr. Dotrice has a slight edge, but one press agent not connected to the show insisted that Mr. Chamberlin had the race in the bag.</p>
        <p>Why? The costume.</p>
        <p>''If you want to win and you're a man,'' said the press agent, ''put on a dress.'' As evidence, he cited Harvey Fierstein, a winner for ''Torch Song Trilogy'' in 1983, and George Hearn, victorious in drag in ''La Cage aux Folles'' in 1984.</p>
        <p>Other supporting categories have strong favorites. Blair Brown is widely expected to be named best featured actress in a play (''Copenhagen''), though the award would also seem to reflect her earlier -- and unnominated -- work in ''The Dead.''</p>
        <p>Another Golden Rule</p>
        <p>For featured actor and actress in a musical, most voters liked Boyd Gaines and Deborah Yates (the Girl in the Yellow Dress) in ''Contact.'' But Ms. Yates can expect some strong competition from her co-star Karen Ziemba and Eartha Kitt, generally considered one of the few standout elements about the Public Theater's ''Wild Party.''</p>
        <p>One theory holds that Ms. Ziemba and Ms. Yates will split the ''Contact'' coalition, allowing Ms. Kitt to take the prize.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Gaines wins and Ms. Ziemba or Ms. Yates carries the day, it could be the perfect overture to a probable win for ''Contact'' as best musical. Such a victory would probably cause ever more hand-wringing by theater people but would also adhere to one of Broadway's golden rules.</p>
        <p>As one producer put it: ''Whatever leaves them clapping and coming back for more, that's the best musical on Broadway.''</p>
        <p>Your Box Seat</p>
        <p>The Tony Awards ceremony at Radio City Music Hall will be broadcast live on Sunday night. The first hour, from 8 to 9, will be broadcast by PBS (Channel 13 in New York). From 9 to 11 the program will be seen on CBS (Channel 2 in New York).</p>
