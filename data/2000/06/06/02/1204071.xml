        <p>Printmaking was not a preferred activity for Edward Hopper (1882-1967). He did it for only a decade, from 1913 to 1923, while earning a living as a magazine illustrator. Yet in that time he produced his first mature work, a wonderful body of etchings that brought realism, emotion and a strong sense of the medium's potential to a field that had become more decorative than challenging.</p>
        <p>Using many of the motifs that he was to pursue in his later paintings  -- nudes, loners, decrepit houses, night scenes, railroad trains -- Hopper took full advantage of the intense moodiness a black-and-white etching can convey, with deep lines, dark cross-hatching and Stygian shadows bitten into the whiteness of the paper. He produced around 60 etchings and drypoints before hanging up his hat, on the handle of his printing press, and leaving it there. In the early 1920's he became preoccupied with more ambitious oils and watercolors.</p>

        <p>Printmaking was not a preferred activity for Edward Hopper (1882-1967). He did it for only a decade, from 1913 to 1923, while earning a living as a magazine illustrator. Yet in that time he produced his first mature work, a wonderful body of etchings that brought realism, emotion and a strong sense of the medium's potential to a field that had become more decorative than challenging.</p>
        <p>Using many of the motifs that he was to pursue in his later paintings  -- nudes, loners, decrepit houses, night scenes, railroad trains -- Hopper took full advantage of the intense moodiness a black-and-white etching can convey, with deep lines, dark cross-hatching and Stygian shadows bitten into the whiteness of the paper. He produced around 60 etchings and drypoints before hanging up his hat, on the handle of his printing press, and leaving it there. In the early 1920's he became preoccupied with more ambitious oils and watercolors.</p>
        <p>There are few better places to see these powerful prints than the Whitney Museum, which in 1970 inherited nearly two-thirds of Hopper's known etchings and drypoints from his wife Jo along with related drawings and all of his surviving copper and zinc plates. Nearly 50 works -- a few accompanied by preparatory drawings and plates -- are on view in the Whitney's current ''Edward Hopper, Printmaker,'' the first show devoted solely to his prints since the Whitney's landmark exhibition of them along with his illustrations in 1979. The etchings are mostly lifetime impressions, but Hopper was in no hurry to run his work through the press, and a few in the show were produced posthumously.</p>
        <p>The pervasive theme of loneliness and isolation for which he was noted is very much present here, particularly in prints like ''Night Shadows'' and ''Night in the Park'' (both 1921). In ''Night Shadows'' the dark figures of a man and his shadow are seen on an illuminated pavement, alongside the light and dark masses of a nearby building that itself thrusts an inky finger of shadow across the man's path. This strikingly composed scene is made more ominous by its overhead perspective, as if viewed from the window of a nearby building.</p>
        <p>''Night in the Park'' is a less arresting treatment but it, too, conveys a haunting emptiness. At the end of a row of empty park benches, lighted by a street lamp, a man sits reading a newspaper. Walls of dark foliage loom beside him, but there is no other presence in the deserted nightscape.</p>
        <p>Yet partly because of the more conventional composition, the dark seems friendlier than in ''Night Shadows.'' The long diagonals of the work, the overhead light and the stretch of pavement on which the park benches sit seem to foreshadow the structure of Hopper's famous painting of 1942, ''Nighthawks,'' a scene at a 24-hour coffee shop.</p>
        <p>Two of Hopper's best-known evocations of urban life focus on women, placed in similar settings. The more memorable is ''Evening Wind'' (1921), depicting a nude woman, braced on her hands and knees in a bed with the covers thrown back, next to a window. Her face turned away from the viewer, she looks out the window as its curtains blow lightly in. What she contemplates is not conveyed, but the scene suggests the angst and restlessness of a long, hot night.</p>
        <p>In ''East Side Interior'' (1922), a less melancholy but wistful young woman seated at a sewing machine in a dark, claustrophobic room gazes out the window as if relishing her narrow view of the street. In both cases, the confinement of the women to seedy interior spaces while contemplating the outside world makes an interesting statement, although the artist -- known for his skilled and sympathetic renditions of the female body -- almost certainly intended no societal comment in his work.</p>
        <p>The fully developed conte crayon-and-charcoal drawings for ''Evening Wind'' and ''East Side Interior,'' shown along with the etchings themselves, reveal part of Hopper's painstaking method of preparing for a print. Typically, he stuck to the drawing without making major changes when working on the etching plate.</p>
        <p>Although he received some technical advice from his friend the printmaker Martin Lewis, Hopper learned the craft mostly through trial and error. For his printmaking sources, he looked to the past, certainly to Rembrandt and maybe to the 19th-century French etcher Charles Meryon (1821-1868), admired for his impressions of Parisian light and shadow. The city genre prints made by an older contemporary, the painter John Sloan (1871-1951), may also have been an influence.</p>
        <p>The poignant melancholy that infused much of Hopper's work was by no means confined to urban places. One of his masterpieces in this vein is ''American Landscape'' (1920). It shows a stark rural house against dark woods and a leaden sky. A railroad track runs in front of the house in a straight line across the print. Cows lurk in the foreground, one going over the track. Apart from its gloomy play of light and shadow, the simple scene carries mournful overtones: a sense of the house anchored to the past and the railroad rushing heedlessly on to the future.</p>
        <p>Hopper's views of American life had their brighter moments, too. He liked to depict sailboats in action, and ''The Catboat'' (1922) is a masterly rear view of a small one and its handlers heeling toward a rocky shore in choppy water.</p>
        <p>The show, with its wide range of moods and subjects, not only is a fine introduction to Hopper's basic themes but also gives a splendid idea of what he accomplished in the tricky etching medium. That Hopper abandoned prints for the more expansive field of painting was a great gain, but a loss, too.</p>
        <p>''Edward Hopper, Printmaker'' remains at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue,  at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through July 16.</p>
