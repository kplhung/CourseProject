        <p>MARSHALL-George. The Board and staff of the Adirondack Council note with sadness the passing of George Marshall on May 21, 2000 at age 96. He was a longtime conservationist and friend of the Adirondacks. With his brother Robert, he was one of the first three people to climb the 46 High Peaks of the Adirondacks. And, with his father Louis and brothers James and Robert, George was one of the foremost defenders of the ''Forever Wild'' Clause of the New York State Constitution, which protects the Adirondack and Catskill Forest Preserves. George also served as President of the Wilderness Society and the Sierra Club. Our sympathies to the Marshall and Scholle families, who continue this tradition of passionate work on behalf of the Adirondacks.</p>
