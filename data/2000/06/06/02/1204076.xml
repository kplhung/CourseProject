        <p>If the ultimate beach book is a really long novel, then Proust's seven-volume ''A la Recherche du Temps Perdu'' should top the summer reading list. ''Remembrance of Things Past,'' now being called ''In Search of Lost Time,'' has never gone out of print and is considered  the greatest French novel of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>With summer upon us, it seems fitting that Christie's is selling the first part of the novel -- ''Swann's Way'' -- in galley proofs riddled with Proust's own corrections and jottings. This long-lost set of galleys has drawn a great deal of attention since it was put on view in March at the inauguration of Christie's opulent new Paris headquarters.</p>
        <p>Legislation permitting Christie's to conduct auctions in France has not yet been passed. So on Wednesday, Christie's will auction the lost Proust galleys in London, and the sale is expected to be the highlight of Book Week there.</p>
        <p>Christie's Proust sale includes the complete text, in annotated galley proofs, of ''Combray,'' the earliest section of ''A la Recherche du Temps Perdu,'' as well as the text of all but the final page of ''Un Amour de Swann'' (''Swann in Love''). These two parts make up most of ''Du Cote de Chez Swann'' (''Swann's Way''), the first of the seven parts of Proust's magnum opus. The set of galleys is expected to sell for $960,000 to $1.4 million.</p>
        <p>According to Verene de Soultrait, a specialist in the book department at Christie's Paris, the proofs represent the most important literary autograph manuscript of Proust left in private hands. These are not simply galley proofs but proofs so extensively marked up in Proust's own hand that they look like concrete poetry,  with a visual appeal as well as literary significance.</p>
        <p>Bart Auerbach, a literary appraiser in New York, explained that Proust's novels ''are virtually rewritten on the galleys.''</p>
        <p>Proust was well aware of how obsessive he was in his rewriting, adding and canceling lines until the last possible moment before his works went into print.</p>
        <p>As the Christie's catalog points out, in 1913 he wrote a letter to a Mr. J. L. Vaudoyer about ''Combray,'' admitting: ''I am busy correcting my first proofs. New galleys arrive every day, but I have not returned a single one yet . . . My corrections so far (I hope that this will not go on) are more than just that. Not one line in 20 remains of the original text (already rewritten as it was). It is crossed out, corrected wherever I can find a blank space, and I paste on pieces of paper at the top, bottom, left, right, etc. . . .''</p>
        <p>This lost text remains unpublished to this day. ''It's a literary event in a sense, because no one knew it was available,'' Mr. Auerbach said of the sale.</p>
        <p>Christie's will not reveal the name, vocation or country of the consignor.</p>
        <p>Bill Reese, a rare book dealer in New Haven, said the galleys were important because they ''address the issue of authorial intention.''</p>
        <p>''The set of galleys raises the question of what is the proper text,'' he continued. ''You see the levels of his intentions as he goes along with his endless tinkering and reworking of the past. The galleys are another layer in the story, a whole new set of information on one of the great novels of the 20th century. It is a truly important literary event.''</p>
        <p>Most of Proust's manuscripts are in the collection of the National Library of France. The library bought most of its Proust archive from Marcel Proust's niece, who inherited it from her father, his brother. Scholars there have published two other sets of galley proofs for ''Swann's Way.''</p>
        <p>''They realized, however,'' Ms. de Soultrait writes in the catalog, concerning the lost proofs in the sale, ''that a third set must have existed, consolidating all the revisions and adding numbers of others, which Proust returned to the printer for subsequent page proofs. No future critical edition of the novel may omit close study of the extensive autograph revisions.''</p>
        <p>Felix de Marez Oyens, senior director of Christie's International Department of Printed Books and Manuscripts, in London, said: ''A lot of Proust's text is not represented in either the second proofs or in the published edition, because he did so much rewriting that he then crossed out. The reworkings are part of the creative process. This is the objective expression of it, the physical expression of his changes of mind.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Auerbach added, ''There was always a possibility that something like this would turn up, but it was remote. If you are a Proust collector, this sale could be your last chance to get something. Another opportunity might not ever come up.''</p>
        <p>Proust, of course, is more popular than ever. There is, for example, the Proust Society of America, based in New York; the aptly named NAPS, or North American Proust Society, headed up by the New York novelist Eric Kraft; and a Proust Support Group in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Yale University Press recently published William C. Carter's 946-page ''Marcel Proust: A Life.'' Last year, Editions du Patrimoine in France published ''Le Monde de Proust Vu par Paul Nadar,'' a book of historical Nadar portraits of Proust and his circle. Earlier, Vintage published Alain de Botton's popular ''How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel,'' a biographical portrait with lessons on Proustian self-improvement, like ''How to Express Your Emotions'' and ''How to Suffer Successfully.''</p>
        <p>The appeal of Proust runs deep. ''Camus, Sartre and Gide have faded,'' Mr. Auerbach said. ''Proust has lasted. I have a theory that Proust, like all great writers, created an alternative universe that we can live in. It's the same for Trollope and Joyce. You become part of the Proust world and it's endlessly absorbing. It's the lost childhood in all of us. It's the detail, the beauty of the style, the absorption. You just want to stay in it.''</p>
        <p>He recalled that E. M. Forster called ''Recherche'' a ''cathedral of a novel.'' In his biography, Mr. Carter notes that Proust lived through three turbulent eras: the fin de siecle, the Belle Epoque and World War I. He writes, ''His novel bears witness to the rich, complex workings of the mind and heart -- memory, love, passion, both sacred and profane -- and to the oceanic transformations that changed the horse-and-buggy world to one of aviation, Cubism, mode in fashion, comfort and hygiene.''</p>
        <p>David Rea, a retired lawyer in Sag Harbor, N.Y. who is a longtime Proust enthusiast, put it differently. ''Proust composed with intensity and intelligence,'' he said. ''He may have been the first to articulate the idea of involuntary memory; how certain sounds, smells and touches take you out of the present. Trivial things assume the role of great things. The book touches you at a number of levels, and when it's over, you're sorry and wish it were longer. It's like the Odyssey. Miracles are happening all the time despite the terrible dailiness of life.''</p>
