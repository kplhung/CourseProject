        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman settled an 18-month standoff at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey yesterday, clearing the way for long-blocked projects worth billions to both states.</p>
        <p>In a flurry of late-afternoon telephone calls, the two governors -- who had refused appeals from their political colleagues to speak to each other about the impasse -- put the finishing touches on a deal their negotiators have hammered out over the last several months.</p>
        <p>The agency's 12-member board is expected to ratify the agreement at a meeting today, where, one member said, ''the floodgates will open'' when members vote on previously stalled projects and other deals reached in the negotiations.</p>
        <p>In the governors' talks yesterday, Mr. Pataki agreed to end New York's opposition to a 30-year lease for the Maersk-Sealand shipping line to expand its operations at the Elizabeth Marine Terminal. The proposed lease had been the major cause of the disagreement, which has all but stymied an agency created 79 years ago to end bickering between the two states over transportation and port commerce.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman, in turn, ended New Jersey's refusal to approve two projects dear to New York: selling or leasing the World Trade Center to private interests and leasing air rights over the Port Authority Bus Terminal.</p>
        <p>As part of the deal, Mrs. Whitman also agreed to a study that is likely to lead to an increase by the end of the year in the $1 fare on the PATH rapid transit line -- a step New York had long sought. The governors, who each control half of the votes on the Port Authority board, had been locked in a dispute over which state received more financial benefits  from the agency, which built and operates all of the bridge and tunnel  crossings between New Jersey and New York City, manages airports and seaports in both states, operates the PATH system and owns the World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>In a joint news release, Mr. Pataki and Mrs. Whitman presented dueling encomiums to the agreement, which they said would serve commuters, shippers, travelers, the global marketplace and the long-term stability of the region. Their statement gave details on 18 specific actions that they had agreed upon.</p>
        <p>''This agreement will ensure the Port Authority moves forward with important projects that will help spur economic growth for the entire region, creating more jobs and opportunities for hard-working New Yorkers,'' Mr. Pataki said in the  statement.</p>
        <p>For her part, Governor Whitman added, ''It will guarantee the lasting prominence of our shared port in the global marketplace and will provide a foundation for the long-term stability of the port region.''</p>
        <p>New York officials have long contended that New Jersey, which is smaller and contributes less to the region's economy, has benefited disproportionately from agency spending.</p>
        <p>Some items in the agreement that seemed aimed at addressing New York's concerns included the creation of a $250 million ''development bank'' for New York transportation projects over the next three years  and the allocation of agency money for economic development efforts in South Jamaica, Queens, where a new terminal is planned to connect subway and commuter trains to a Kennedy Airport rail link.</p>
        <p>New York would also benefit from the agreement's call for approval of measures to improve Howland Hook and Red Hook port and barge operations and its promise that the Port Authority will lease space in the proposed main post office and Pennsylvania Station renovation in Midtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The agreement also calls for agency approval of the northbound connection of the Staten Island Railroad to CSX Transportation's Chemical Coast Line.</p>
        <p>Among the gains for New Jersey in the agreement are the allocation of $120 million in agency funds for dredging operations that New Jersey had previously planned to finance on its own, and the sale of cranes to help modernize several cargo terminals.</p>
        <p>The agreement also gives the go-ahead to the purchase and development by the port agency of a Jersey City site for port use, the privatization of the Newark Legal Center and a study of the feasibility of extending the PATH line to Newark Airport monorail connections.</p>
        <p>While the impasse had not completely hobbled the agency, it had blocked the authority's major initiatives and spawned furious philosophical debates between the two states' representatives over whether Port Authority investments benefited the region, or just one state.</p>
        <p>Differences over these issues had thrown the agency into tumult, threatening the agency's reputation as a can-do and efficient builder.</p>
        <p>As part of the agreement, the governors have directed the agency board to begin two studies to try to bridge those philosophical differences and set clear criteria for projects. One study would modify how the Port Authority evaluates a project's cost, return on investment and regional benefit. The other would study the financial and operating structure of the agency and more throughly examine the allocation of resources between the two states.</p>
